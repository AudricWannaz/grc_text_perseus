And that is why he chose to do with men as he would with the other animals, which we do not keep without consideration, but give each kind the particular skilled attention which will produce the finest strain. This is proved by the following lines: 183-90. The meaning of these verses is that men do not know how to produce their kind properly, and the result is that the human race is not so good as it might be because the good is always mingled with the bad. But the generality of men take these lines as proving that the poet accuses his fellowmen of busying themselves in vain matters, and of knowing how to make money compensate for low-birth and viciousness.

Thus it was that I first composed a poem to the God whose festival was being held; and then, believing that the poet, if he is to be worth the name, should compose myth or fable and not history and I had no expert knowledge of fiction myself, I took the fables I had at hand and knew, namely Aesop's, and put the first I happened on into verse.

Thus it was that I first composed a poem to the God whose festival was being held; and then, believing that the poet, if he is to be worth the name, should compose myth or fable and not history and I had no expert knowledge of fiction myself, I took the fables I had at hand and knew, namely Aesop's, and put the first I happened on into verse.
