Nay,\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tthe very grammarians and musicians themselves who arrived to the height of education have expended much time\n\t\t\t\tand study upon the same subject, whence has arisen great\n\t\t\t\tvariety of discording opinions among the several writers.\n\t\t\t\tHeraclides in his Compendium of Music asserts, that\n\t\t\t\tAmphion, the son of Jupiter and Antiope, was the first\n\t\t\t\tthat invented playing on the harp and lyric poesy, being\n\t\t\t\tfirst instructed by his father; which is confirmed by a small\n\t\t\t\tmanuscript, preserved in the city of Sicyon, wherein is set\n\t\t\t\tdown a catalogue of the priests, poets, and musicians of\n\t\t\t\tArgos. In the same age, he tells us, Linus the Euboean\n\t\t\t\tcomposed several elegies; Anthes of Anthedon in Boeotia\n\t\t\t\twas the first author of hymns, and Pierus of Pieria the first\n\t\t\t\tthat wrote in the praise of the Muses. Philammon also, the\n\t\t\t\tDelphian, set forth in verse a poem in honor of the nativity\n\t\t\t\tof Latona, Diana, and Apollo, and was the first that instituted dancing about the temple of Delphi. Thamyras, of\n\t\t\t\tThracian extraction, had the best voice and the neatest\n\t\t\t\tmanner of singing of any of his time; so that the poets\n\t\t\t\tfeigned him to be a contender with the Muses. He is said\n\t\t\t\tto have described in a poem the Titans' war against the\n\t\t\t\tGods. There was also Demodocus the Corcyraean, who is\n\t\t\t\tsaid to have written the Destruction of Troy, and the Nuptials of Vulcan and Venus; and then Phemius of Ithaca\n\t\t\t\tcomposed a poem, entitled The Return of those who came\n\t\t\t\tback with Agamemnon from Troy. Not that any of these\n\t\t\t\tstories before cited were compiled in a style like prose\n\t\t\t\twithout metre; they were rather like the poems of Stesichorus and other ancient lyric poets, who composed in\n\t\t\t\theroic verse and added a musical accompaniment. The\n\t\t\t\tsame Heraclides writes that Terpander, the first that instituted the lyric \n                set verses of Homer as well as his\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\town to music according to each of these nomes, and sang\n\t\t\t\tthem at public trials of skill. He also was the first to give\n\t\t\t\tnames to the lyric nomes. In imitation of Terpander, Clonas, an elegiac and epic poet, first instituted nomes for\n\t\t\t\tflute-music, and also the songs called Prosodia.

We\n\t\t\t\tare now lovers of fables, they were then lovers of rhythm.\n\t\t\t\tPlain it is therefore, that the ancients did not refrain from\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tbroken measures out of ignorance, but out of judgment.\n\t\t\t\tAnd yet what wonder is this, when there are so many other\n\t\t\t\tthings necessary to human life which are not unknown,\n\t\t\t\tthough not made use of by those who have no occasion to\n\t\t\t\tuse them?

For in his discourse concerning the procreation of the soul, inserted into Timaeus,\n\t\t\t\the has made known his great knowledge in all the sciences,\n\t\t\t\tand of music among the rest, in this manner:  saith he, \n                This proem was the effect of his experience\n\t\t\t\tin music, as we shall presently make out. The means\n\t\t\t\tfrom whence every mean is taken are three, arithmetical,\n\t\t\t\tenharmonical, geometrical. Of these the first exceeds and\n\t\t\t\tis exceeded in number, the second in proportion, the third\n\t\t\t\tneither in number nor proportion. Plato therefore, desirous\n\t\t\t\tto show the harmony of the four elements in the soul, and\n\t\t\t\tharmonically also to explain the reason of that mutual concord arising from discording and jarring principles, undertakes to make out two middle terms of the soul in every\n\t\t\t\tinterval, according to harmonical proportion. Thus in a\n\t\t\t\tmusical octave there happen to be two middle distances,\n\t\t\t\twhose proportion we shall explain. As for the octaves,\n\t\t\t\tthey keep a double proportion between their two extremes.\n\t\t\t\tFor example, let the double arithmetical proportion be 6\n\t\t\t\tand 12, this being the interval between the  and\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tthe  6 therefore and 12 being the two\n\t\t\t\textremes, the former note contains the number 6, and the\n\t\t\t\tlatter 12. To these are to be added the intermediate\n\t\t\t\tnumbers, to which the extremes must hold the proportion,\n\t\t\t\tthe one of one and a third, and the other of one and a\n\t\t\t\thalf. These are the numbers 8 and 9. For as 8 contains\n\t\t\t\tone and a third of 6, so 9 contains one and a half of 6;\n\t\t\t\tthus you have one extreme. The other is 12, containing 9\n\t\t\t\tand a third part of 9, and 8 and half 8. These then being\n\t\t\t\tthe numbers between 6 and 12, and the interval of the\n\t\t\t\toctave consisting of a diatessaron and diapente, it is plain\n\t\t\t\tthat the number 8 belongs to mese, and the number 9 to\n\t\t\t\tparamese; which being so, it follows that hypate is to\n\t\t\t\tmese as paramese to nete of the disjunct tetrachords; for it\n\t\t\t\tis a fourth from the first term to the second of this proportion, and the same interval from the third term to the\n\t\t\t\tfourth. The same proportion will be also found in the numbers. For as 6 is to 8, so is 8 to 12; and as 6 is to 9, so\n\t\t\t\tis 8 to 12. For 8 is one and a third part of 6, and 12 of\n\t\t\t\t9; while 9 is one and a half part of 6, and 12 of 8.

The\n\t\t\t\treason of this, we say, is either a certain plain and mixed\n\t\t\t\tcomposure, or both; like the enharmonic species of Olympus, by him set in the Phrygian mood and mixed with the\n\t\t\t\tpaeon epibatos, which rendered the beginning of the key\n\t\t\t\tnaturally elegant in what is called the nome of Minerva.\n\t\t\t\tFor having made choice of his key and measure, he only\n\t\t\t\tchanged the paeon epibatos for the trochee, which produced his enharmonic species. However, the enharmonic\n\t\t\t\tspecies and Phrygian tone remaining together with the\n\t\t\t\twhole system, the elegancy of the character was greatly\n\t\t\t\taltered. For that which was called harmony in the nome\n\t\t\t\tof Minerva was quite another thing from that in the introduction. He then that has both judgment as well as skill\n\t\t\t\tis to be accounted the most accurate musician. For he that\n\t\t\t\tunderstands the Dorian mood, not being able withal to discern by his judgment what is proper to it and when it is fit\n\t\t\t\tto be made use of, shall never know what he does; nay, he\n\t\t\t\tshall quite mistake the nature and custom of the key.\n\t\t\t\tIndeed it is much questioned among the Dorians themselves, whether the enharmonic composers be competent\n\t\t\t\tjudges of the Dorian songs. The same is to be said concerning the knowledge of rhythm. For he that understands\n\t\t\t\ta paeon may not understand the proper use of it, though\n\t\t\t\the know the measure of which it consists. Because it is\n\t\t\t\tmuch doubted among those that make use of paeons,\n\t\t\t\twhether the bare knowledge make a man capable to determine\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t concerning the proper use of those rhythms; or, as\n\t\t\t\tothers say, whether it aspire to presume so far. Therefore\n\t\t\t\tit behooves that person to have two sorts of knowledge,\n\t\t\t\twho will undertake to judge of what is proper and what\n\t\t\t\timproper; first, of the custom and manner of elegancy for\n\t\t\t\twhich such a composition was intended, and next of those\n\t\t\t\tthings of which the composition consists. And thus, that\n\t\t\t\tneither the bare knowledge of harmony, nor of rhythm, nor\n\t\t\t\tof any other things that singly by themselves are but a part\n\t\t\t\tof the whole body of music, is sufficient to judge and determine either of the one or the other, what has been already\n\t\t\t\tsaid may suffice to prove."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "34", "p": {"note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The passage in brackets is out of place here, and is generally transferred to the\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle of Chapter XXXVII.
