The natural is when our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenquiries are concerning the world and all things contained in it; the ethical is the employment of our minds in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose things which concern the manners of man's life; the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlogical (which they also call dialectical) regulates our conversation with others in speaking.

But if these be the questions,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat measures must be taken to compose the well ordered life of man, what are the best methods to govern\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand educate children, or what are the exact rules whereby\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsovereigns may command and establish laws,all these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tqueries are proposed for the sole end of action, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tman conversant therein is the moral and practical man."}}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "1", "head": {"lb": null, "#text": "Chapter I.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t WHAT IS NATURE?"}, "p": {"pb": {"@id": "v.3.p.106"}, "#text": "SINCE we have undertaken to make a diligent search\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto Nature, I cannot but conclude it necessary to declare\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat Nature is.

Diodes, that sickness for the most part proceeds from the irregular disposition of the elements in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody, for that makes an ill habit or constitution of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tErasistratus, that sickness is caused by the excess of food,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindigestion, and corruptions; on the contrary, health is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoderation of the diet, and the taking that which is convenient and sufficient for us. It is the unanimous opinion\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Stoics that the want of heat brings old age, for (they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsay) those persons in whom heat more abounds live the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger. Asclepiades, that the Ethiopians soon grow old,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand at thirty years of age are ancient men, their bodies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing excessively heated and scorched by the sun; in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBritain persons live a hundred and twenty years, on account\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the coldness of the country, and because the people\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontain the fiery element within their bodies; for the bodies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Ethiopians are more fine and thin, because they are\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelaxed by the sun's heat, while they who live in northern\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries have a contrary state of their bodies, for they are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcondensed and robust, and by consequence live the longer."}}]}], "pb": {"@id": "v.3.p.176"}}}}}
