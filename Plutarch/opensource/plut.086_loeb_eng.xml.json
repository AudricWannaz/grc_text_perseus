For the tale that a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain Egeria, a dryad and a wise divinity, consorted\n\t\t\t\t\tin love with the man, and helped him in instituting\n\t\t\t\t\tand shaping the government of his State, is perhaps\n\t\t\t\t\tsomewhat fabulous. For other mortals who are said\n\t\t\t\t\tto have attained divine marriages and to have been\n\t\t\t\t\tbeloved of goddesses, men like Peleus and Anchises,\n\t\t\t\t\tOrion and Emathion, by no means lived through their\n\t\t\t\t\tlives in a satisfactory, or even painless, manner. On\n\t\t\t\t\tthe contrary, it appears likely that Numa had Good\n\t\t\t\t\tFortune as his true wife, counsellor, and colleague ;\n\t\t\t\t\tand she took the city in charge when it was being\n\t\t\t\t\tcarried hither and yon amid the enmity and fierceness\n\t\t\t\t\tof bordering tribes and neighbours, as in the midst of\n\t\t\t\t\tturbulent billows of a troubled sea and was inflamed\n\t\t\t\t\tby countless struggles and dissensions; and she calmed\n\t\t\t\t\tthose opposing passions and jealousies as though they\n\t\t\t\t\thad been but gusts of wind. Even as they relate\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the sea, when it has received the brood of\n\t\t\t\t\thalcyons in the stormy season, keeps them safe and\n\t\t\t\t\tassists in their nurture, even such a calm in the affairs\n\t\t\t\t\tof Rome, free from war or pestilence or danger or\n\t\t\t\t\tterror, Fortune caused to overspread and surround\n\t\t\t\t\tthe city, and thus afforded the opportunity to a newly\n\t\t\t\t\tsettled and sorely shaken people to take root and to\n\t\t\t\t\testablish their city on a firm foundation where it might\n\t\t\t\t\tgrow in quiet, securely and unhindered. It is as with a\n\t\t\t\t\tmerchantman or a trireme, which is constructed by\n\t\t\t\t\tblows and with great violence, and is buffeted by\n\t\t\t\t\thammers and nails, bolts and saws and axes, and, when\n\t\t\t\t\tit is completed, it must remain at rest and grow firm for\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\ta suitable period of time until its bonds hold tight and\n\t\t\t\t\tits fastenings have acquired affinity; but if it be\n\t\t\t\t\tlaunched while its joinings are still damp and slippery,\n\t\t\t\t\tthese will all be loosened when they are racked by the\n\t\t\t\t\twaves, and will admit the sea. Even so the first\n\t\t\t\t\truler and artificer of Rome, in organizing the city\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom rustics and shepherds, as though building up\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom a stout keel, took upon himself no few labours,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor of slight moment were the wars and dangers that\n\t\t\t\t\the withstood in warding off, of necessity, those who\n\t\t\t\t\topposed the creation and foundation of Rome."}, {"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Life of Sulla"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Compar. of Lysander and Sulla"}], "#text": ", chap. xxix.

There is, in fact, a shrine of Private Fortune\n\t\t\t\t\ton the Palatine, and the shrine of the Fowler's\n\t\t\t\t\tFortune which, even though it be a ridiculous name,\n\t\t\t\t\tyet gives reason for reflexion on metaphorical\n\t\t\t\t\tgrounds, as if she attracted far-away objects and held\n\t\t\t\t\tthem fast when they come into contact with her.\n\t\t\t\t\tBeside the Mossy Spring, as it is called, there is even\n\t\t\t\t\tyet a temple of Virgin Fortune ; and on the Esquiline\n\t\t\t\t\ta shrine of Regardful Fortune. In the Angiportus\n\t\t\t\t\tLongus there is an altar of Fortune of Good Hope ;\n\t\t\t\t\tand there is also beside the altar of Venus of the\n\t\t\t\t\tBasket a shrine of the Men's Fortune. And there\n\t\t\t\t\tare countless other honours and appellations of\n\t\t\t\t\tFortune, the greater part of which Servius instituted ;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor he knew that \n                and particularly since he himself, through good fortune, had\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen promoted from the family of a captive enemy\n\t\t\t\t\tto the kingship. For, when the town of Corniculum\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\twas taken by the Romans, a captive maiden Ocrisia,\n\t\t\t\t\twhose fortune could not obscure either her beauty or\n\t\t\t\t\ther character, was given to be a slave to Tanaquil, the\n\t\t\t\t\twife of king Tarquin ; and a certain dependent, one\n\t\t\t\t\tof those whom the Romans call , had her to wife;\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom these parents Servius was born. Others deny\n\t\t\t\t\tthis, but assert that Ocrisia was a maiden who took\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first-fruits and the libations on all occasions from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe royal table and brought them to the hearth ; and\n\t\t\t\t\tonce on a time when she chanced, as usual, to be\n\t\t\t\t\tcasting the offerings upon the fire, suddenly, as the\n\t\t\t\t\tflames died down, the member of a man rose up out\n\t\t\t\t\tof the hearth ; and this the girl, greatly frightened,\n\t\t\t\t\ttold to Tanaquil only. Now Tanaquil was an intelligent and understanding woman, and she decked the\n\t\t\t\t\tmaiden in garments such as become a bride, and shut\n\t\t\t\t\ther up in the room with the apparition, for she judged\n\t\t\t\t\tit to be of a divine nature. Some declare that this love\n\t\t\t\t\twas manifested by the Lar of the house, others that\n\t\t\t\t\tit was by Vulcan. At any rate, it resulted in the birth\n\t\t\t\t\tof Servius, and, while he was still a child, his head\n\t\t\t\t\tshone with a radiance very like the gleam of lightning.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut Antias and his school say not so, but relate that\n\t\t\t\t\twhen Servius's wife Gegania lay dying, in the presence\n\t\t\t\t\tof his mother he fell into a sleep from dejection and\n\t\t\t\t\tgrief; and as he slept, his face was seen by the\n\t\t\t\t\twomen to be surrounded by the gleam of fire. This\n\t\t\t\t\twas a token of his birth from fire and an excellent\n\t\t\t\t\tsign pointing to his unexpected accession to the kingship, which he gained after the death of Tarquin, by\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthe zealous assistance of Tanaquil. Inasmuch as he\n\t\t\t\t\tof all kings is thought to have been naturally the\n\t\t\t\t\tleast suited to monarchy and the least desirous of it,\n\t\t\t\t\the who was minded to resign the kingship, but was\n\t\t\t\t\tprevented from doing so ; for it appears that Tanaquil\n\t\t\t\t\ton her death-bed made him swear that he would\n\t\t\t\t\tremain in power and would ever set before him\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ancestral Roman form of government. Thus to\n\t\t\t\t\tFortune wholly belongs the kingship of Servius, which\n\t\t\t\t\the received contrary to his expectations and retained\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst his will."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "11", "p": [{"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Persians"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cf.

After the great defeat\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Romans at the river Allia, some in their\n\t\t\t\t\tflight found a haven in Rome and filled the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople with consternation and terror, and caused\n\t\t\t\t\tthem to scatter far and wide, although a few went\n\t\t\t\t\tto the Capitol and prepared to stand a siege.\n\t\t\t\t\tOthers, immediately after their defeat, gathered\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether at Veii and appointed as dictator Furius\n\t\t\t\t\tCamillus, whom the people in their prosperity and\n\t\t\t\t\tlofty pride had rejected and deposed because he\n\t\t\t\t\thad become involved in a suit concerning the appropriation of public property.

Now there\n\t\t\t\t\twas a certain Gaius Pontius, a brave man, who, by\n\t\t\t\t\tvolunteering personally to report these resolutions\n\t\t\t\t\tto the Senate on the Capitol, took upon himself great\n\t\t\t\t\tdanger.
