For instance virtue, when it considers\n\t\t\t\t\twhat we must do or avoid, is called prudence; when\n\t\t\t\t\tit controls our desires and lays down for them the\n\t\t\t\t\tlimitations of moderation and seasonableness in our\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasures, it is called temperance ; when it has to do\n\t\t\t\t\twith men's relations to one another and their commercial dealings, it is called justice - just as a knife is\n\t\t\t\t\tone and the same knife, though it cuts now one thing,\n\t\t\t\t\tnow another, or as a fire retains its single nature\n\t\t\t\t\tthough it operates upon different substances. Moreover it appears likely that Zeno of Citium also\n\t\t\t\t\tinclines in some measure to this opinion, for he defines\n\t\t\t\t\tprudence as justice when it is concerned with what\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be rendered to others as their due, as temperance when concerned with what must be chosen or\n\t\t\t\t\tavoided, as fortitude when concerned with what must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe endured ; and those who defend Zeno postulate\n\t\t\t\t\tthat in these definitions he uses the word prudence in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sense of knowledge.

Now in this world things\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tare of two sorts, some of them existing absolutely,\n\t\t\t\t\tothers in some relation to us. Things that exist\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely are earth, heavens, stars, sea ; things that\n\t\t\t\t\texist in relation to us are good and evil, things desirable and to be avoided, things pleasant and painful.\n\t\t\t\t\tNow reason contemplates both of these, but when\n\t\t\t\t\tit is concerned merely with things which exist absolutely, it is called scientific and contemplative ; and\n\t\t\t\t\twhen it is engaged with those things which exist in\n\t\t\t\t\trelation to us, it is called deliberative and practical.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe virtue of the latter activity is called prudence,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of the former wisdom ; and prudence differs from\n\t\t\t\t\twisdom in that when the contemplative faculty is\n\t\t\t\t\toccupied in a certain active relationship with the\n\t\t\t\t\tpractical and passionate, prudence comes to subsist in\n\t\t\t\t\taccordance with reason. Therefore prudence has\n\t\t\t\t\tneed of chance, but wisdom has no need of it, nor yet\n\t\t\t\t\tof deliberation, to attain its proper end ; for wisdom is\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned with things that remain ever the same and\n\t\t\t\t\tunchanging. And just as the geometer does not\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberate whether the triangle has its internal angles\n\t\t\t\t\tequal to two right angles, but knows it to be true (for\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberation concerns matters that are now one way,\n\t\t\t\t\tnow another, not things that are sure and immutable),\n\t\t\t\t\tjust so the contemplative mind has its activity concerning first principles, things that are permanent\n\t\t\t\t\tand have ever one nature incapable of mutation, and\n\t\t\t\t\tso has no occasion for deliberation. But prudence\n\t\t\t\t\tmust often come down among things that are\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterial and are full of error and confusion ; it has\n\t\t\t\t\tto move in the realm of chance ; to deliberate where\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case is doubtful; and then at last to reduce\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberation to practice in activities in which decisions are both accompanied by and influenced by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe irrational, whose impulsion they, as a matter of\n\t\t\t\t\tfact, need. The impulsion of passion springs from\n\t\t\t\t\tmoral virtue ; but it needs reason to keep it within\n\t\t\t\t\tmoderate bounds and to prevent its exceeding or\n\t\t\t\t\tfalling short of its proper season. For it is indeed\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue that the passionate and irrational moves sometimes too violently and swiftly, at other times\n\t\t\t\t\tmore weakly and slothfully than the case demands.\n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore everything that we ever do can succeed\n\t\t\t\t\tbut in one way, while it may fail in many ways:\n\t\t\t\t\tfor to hit the mark there is but one single, uncomplicated, way, yet it can be missed in several ways,\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to whether we exceed the mean, or fall\n\t\t\t\t\tshort of it. This, then, is the natural task of\n\t\t\t\t\tpractical reason : to eliminate both the defects and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe excesses of the passions. For wherever, through\n\t\t\t\t\tinfirmity and weakness, or fear and hesitation, the\n\t\t\t\t\timpulsion yields too soon and prematurely forsakes\n\t\t\t\t\tthe good, there practical reason comes on the\n\t\t\t\t\tscene to incite and rekindle the impulsion; and\n\t\t\t\t\twhere, again, the impulsion is borne beyond proper\n\t\t\t\t\tbounds, flowing powerfully and in disorder, there\n\t\t\t\t\tpractical reason removes its violence and checks\n\t\t\t\t\tit. And thus by limiting the movement of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpassions reason implants in the irrational the moral\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtues, which are means between deficiency and\n\t\t\t\t\texcess. For we must not declare that every virtue\n\t\t\t\t\tcomes into being by the observance of a mean,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut, on the one hand, wisdom, being without any\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tneed of the irrational and arising in the activity\n\t\t\t\t\tof the mind, pure and uncontaminated by passion,\n\t\t\t\t\tis, as it were, a self-sufficing perfection and power\n\t\t\t\t\tof reason, by which the most divine and blessed\n\t\t\t\t\telement of knowledge becomes possible for us ;\n\t\t\t\t\ton the other hand, that virtue which is necessary\n\t\t\t\t\tto us because of our physical limitations, and\n\t\t\t\t\tneeds, by Heaven, for its practical ends the service\n\t\t\t\t\tof the passions as its instrument, so to speak,\n\t\t\t\t\tand is not a destruction nor abolition of the irrational in the soul, but an ordering and regulation thereof, is an extreme as regards its power\n\t\t\t\t\tand quality, but as regards its quantity it is a\n\t\t\t\t\tmean, since it does away with what is excessive and\n\t\t\t\t\tdeficient."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "6", "p": [{"q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "mean"}, "note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Ethica Nicomachea"}], "#text": "Aristotle, , ii. 6. 4-9 (1106 a 24)."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf.

And on the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame grounds they hold that incontinence also is\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething less than a vice, but that intemperance is a\n\t\t\t\t\tfull-fledged vice. For intemperance possesses both an\n\t\t\t\t\tevil passion and an evil reason ; under the influence\n\t\t\t\t\tof the former, it is incited by desire to shameful\n\t\t\t\t\tconduct; under the influence of the latter, which,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince its judgement is evil, is enlisted with the desires,\n\t\t\t\t\tintemperance loses even the perception of its errors.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut incontinence, with the aid of reason, preserves\n\t\t\t\t\tits power of judgement intact, yet by its passions,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are stronger than its reason, it is swept along\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst its judgement. That is why incontinence\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffers from intemperance, for in it reason is worsted\n\t\t\t\t\tby passion, whereas with intemperance reason does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot even fight; in the case of incontinence reason\n\t\t\t\t\targues against the desires as it follows them, whereas with intemperance reason guides them and is\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir advocate ; it is characteristic of intemperance\n\t\t\t\t\tthat its reason shares joyfully in the sins committed,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas with incontinence the reason shares in them,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut with reluctance ; with intemperance, reason is\n\t\t\t\t\twillingly swept along into shameful conduct, whereas\n\t\t\t\t\twith incontinence, it betrays honour unwillingly."}, {"quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "l": ["What pleasure can there be, what joy, without", "The golden Aphrodite?

Therefore neither is pain present in reasoning where passion is absent, nor are men forced, as it\n\t\t\t\t\twere, to choose a course contrary to reason, unless\n\t\t\t\t\tindeed some emotion is furtively attached, as it were,\n\t\t\t\t\tto one pan of the balances. This, in fact, happens\n\t\t\t\t\toften : when it is not reasoning that opposes reasoning, but ambition or contentiousness or the pursuit of\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tfavour or jealousy or fear that opposes, we think it is\n\t\t\t\t\ta difference between two reasons, as in the verse:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tand this :\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd in the judgement of suits concerning business\n\t\t\t\t\taffairs the passions rush in unawares and cause the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatest waste of time. So also in the councils of\n\t\t\t\t\tkings those who speak to obtain favour are not\n\t\t\t\t\tadvocating one or the other of two decisions, but are\n\t\t\t\t\tsubmitting to some emotion which is contrary to their\n\t\t\t\t\tcalculation of what is expedient. Therefore in\n\t\t\t\t\taristocratic states the magistrates do not allow\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical speakers to make passionate harangues, for\n\t\t\t\t\treason, if not influenced by passion, inclines to a just\n\t\t\t\t\tbalance toward what is right; but if passion intervenes, the part of the soul that feels pleasure and\n\t\t\t\t\tpain fights and opposes the part which forms judgements and deliberates. Otherwise, why is it that in\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophical speculations no feeling of pain is present\n\t\t\t\t\twhen, under the influence of those who hold different\n\t\t\t\t\topinions, we change our views again and again, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Aristotle himself and Democritus and Chrysippus have recanted without any dismay or pain, and\n\t\t\t\t\teven with pleasure, some of the dogmas they previously held? It is because passion has set up no\n\t\t\t\t\topposition to the contemplative and scientific part\n\t\t\t\t\tof the soul and the irrational part remains quiet and\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not meddle with these matters. Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\treason, as soon as the truth appears, dismisses the\n\t\t\t\t\tfalse and gladly inclines toward the truth ; for it is in\n\t\t\t\t\treason, not in its opposite, that the faculty resides\n\t\t\t\t\twhich yields to persuasion and, through persuasion,\n\t\t\t\t\tchanges opinion. But with most people, their deliberations, judgements, and decisions which are to be\n\t\t\t\t\tconverted into action are in a state of emotion and\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore offer obstructions and difficulties to the path\n\t\t\t\t\tof reason, for reason is checked and confused by the\n\t\t\t\t\tirrational, which, with some emotion of pleasure or\n\t\t\t\t\tfear, pain or desire, rises up to oppose it. In such\n\t\t\t\t\tcases the senses make the decision, since they have\n\t\t\t\t\tcontact with both; and if, in fact, one gains the\n\t\t\t\t\tmastery, it does not destroy the other, but forces it\n\t\t\t\t\tto comply and drags it along resisting. For the\n\t\t\t\t\tlover who admonishes himself uses reason against\n\t\t\t\t\this passion, since they both exist at the same time\n\t\t\t\t\tin his soul, as it were pressing with his hand the\n\t\t\t\t\tother member, which is inflamed, and clearly perceiving that there are two distinct forces and that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are at variance. On the other hand, in those\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberations and speculations where passion is absent\n\t\t\t\t\t(and these are the sort in which the contemplative\n\t\t\t\t\tfaculty most commonly engages), if they be equally\n\t\t\t\t\tbalanced, no judgement has taken place, but merely\n\t\t\t\t\ta perplexity has arisen, which is a rest or suspension\n\t\t\t\t\tof intellectual activity brought about by opposing\n\t\t\t\t\tprobabilities ; but if the inclination falls to either\n\t\t\t\t\tside, the winning opinion has cancelled the other,\n\t\t\t\t\twith the result that there is no pain nor any\n\t\t\t\t\topposition left. In general, when it appears that\n\t\t\t\t\treason is opposing reason, there is no perception of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem as two distinct things, but as a single thing\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\twhich arises in different impressions made upon the\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses.

For since it is equally possible to love\n\t\t\t\t\ta noble youth, well-formed by nature for virtue, and\n\t\t\t\t\tto love an evil and profligate one, and since it happens\n\t\t\t\t\tthat one both becomes angry irrationally against\n\t\t\t\t\tone's own children or parents, and angry justly on\n\t\t\t\t\tbehalf of parents and children against enemies and\n\t\t\t\t\tdespots ; just as in the one case there is perception of\n\t\t\t\t\tstruggle and dissension of passion against reason, so\n\t\t\t\t\tin the other there is perception of persuasion and\n\t\t\t\t\tagreement on the part of passion, which inclines the\n\t\t\t\t\tscales, as it were, in favour of reason and increases its\n\t\t\t\t\tpower.

So again,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen young men happen upon cultivated teachers,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey follow them and admire them at first because of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir usefulness ; but later they come to feel affection\n\t\t\t\t\tfor them also, and in place of familiar companions and\n\t\t\t\t\tpupils they are called lovers and are actually so.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe same thing happens also in people's relations to\n\t\t\t\t\tgood magistrates in cities and good neighbours and\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\trelatives by marriage ; for in the beginning they\n\t\t\t\t\tdutifully associate with one another from some consideration of usefulness, but later they are carried\n\t\t\t\t\tunconsciously into genuine affection, reason drawing\n\t\t\t\t\talong, and aiding in the persuasion of, the passionate\n\t\t\t\t\telement.

For he is\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrolled by his acquired disposition, nurtured by\n\t\t\t\t\this natural disposition, and makes use of reason and\n\t\t\t\t\tintellect. He has, therefore, some portion of the\n\t\t\t\t\tirrational also and has innate within him the mainspring of emotion, not as an adventitious accessory,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut as a necessary part of his being, which should\n\t\t\t\t\tnever be done away with entirely, but must needs\n\t\t\t\t\thave careful tending and education. Therefore the\n\t\t\t\t\twork of reason is not Thracian, not like that of Lycurgus - to cut down and destroy the helpful\n\t\t\t\t\telements of emotion together with the harmful, but to\n\t\t\t\t\tdo as the god who watches over crops and the god\n\t\t\t\t\twho guards the vine do - to lop off the wild growth\n\t\t\t\t\tand to clip away excessive luxuriance, and then to\n\t\t\t\t\tcultivate and to dispose for use the serviceable remainder. For neither do those who fear drunkenness\n\t\t\t\t\tpour out their wine upon the ground, nor do those\n\t\t\t\t\twho fear passion eradicate the disturbing element,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut both temper what they fear. It is, in fact, the\n\t\t\t\t\trebellious kicking and plunging of oxen and horses\n\t\t\t\t\tthat men do away with, not their movements and\n\t\t\t\t\tactivities ; even so reason makes use of the emotions\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they have been subdued and are tame, and\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not hamstring nor altogether excise that part\n\t\t\t\t\tof the soul which should be its servant. For\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t          \n\t\t\t\t\tas Pindar says,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYet much more useful than these beasts are the whole\n\t\t\t\t\tbrood of passions when they are present in the service\n\t\t\t\t\tof reason and help to intensify the virtues : anger,\n\t\t\t\t\tif it be moderate, will assist courage, and hatred of evil\n\t\t\t\t\twill aid justice, and righteous indignation will oppose\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who are prosperous beyond their deserts when\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir souls are inflamed with folly and insolence and\n\t\t\t\t\tthey need to be checked. For who, even if he so\n\t\t\t\t\twished, could separate or sever from friendship a\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural propensity toward affection, from humaneness pity, and from true benevolence the mutual\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipation in joy and grief? And if those err who\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscard love entirely because love may bring madness,\n\t\t\t\t\tneither are they right who blame commerce because\n\t\t\t\t\tit may beget covetousness ; on the contrary, what\n\t\t\t\t\tthey do is somewhat like the action of those who would\n\t\t\t\t\tabolish running because one may chance to stumble,\n\t\t\t\t\tor shooting because one may overshoot the mark, and\n\t\t\t\t\tdislike any singing at all because some sing off key.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor as in the realm of sound musical art produces consonance, not by doing away with the deep low and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe shrill high notes; and in the case of the body, medical art produces health, not by the removal of heat\n\t\t\t\t\tand coldness, but by the proportionately quantitative\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tadmixture of the two ; so in the soul moral virtue is\n\t\t\t\t\tproduced when equity and moderation are engendered\n\t\t\t\t\tby reason in the emotional faculties and activities.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor a soul possessed of excessive pain or joy or fear is\n\t\t\t\t\tlike a swollen and feverish body; it is not so, however,\n\t\t\t\t\tif the joy or pain or fear be moderate. And Homer\n\t\t\t\t\tin his admirable words,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not abolish fear, but excessive fear, in order\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the valiant man may have not foolhardiness but\n\t\t\t\t\tcourage, not audacity but daring. In his pleasures,\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, a man must rid himself of excessive desire,\n\t\t\t\t\tand in punishing wrong, of excessive hatred of evil:\n\t\t\t\t\tfor in this way he will be, in the former case, not\n\t\t\t\t\tinsensible but temperate, and in the latter case, just,\n\t\t\t\t\tnot savage nor cruel. But if the passions could in\n\t\t\t\t\treality be entirely done away with, in many persons\n\t\t\t\t\treason would be too inactive and dulled, like a pilot\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the wind dies down. It is surely this truth\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the legislators also have perceived when they\n\t\t\t\t\ttry to put into their constitutions the emotions of\n\t\t\t\t\tambition and emulation as regards the citizens'\n\t\t\t\t\trelations to each other, but in relation to the enemy\n\t\t\t\t\ttry to rouse and increase their spirited and fighting\n\t\t\t\t\tqualities with trumpets and pipes. For it is not in\n\t\t\t\t\tpoetry only that, as Plato says, he who is inspired\n\t\t\t\t\tand possessed by the Muses renders ridiculous the\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tman who is an artist equipped with exact knowledge\n\t\t\t\t\tof technique, but in battles also the passionate and\n\t\t\t\t\tinspired is irresistible and invincible. This quality it\n\t\t\t\t\tis that Homer says the gods instil into men :\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tand\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tas though the gods were adding passion as an incitement or a vehicle to reason."}, {"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Stoic.
