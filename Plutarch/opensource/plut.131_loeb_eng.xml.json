A man's frame is in no way similar to those\n\t\t\t\t\tcreatures who were made for flesh-eating : he has\n\t\t\t\t\tno hooked beak or sharp nails or jagged teeth, no\n\t\t\t\t\tstrong stomach or warmth of vital fluids able to\n\t\t\t\t\tdigest and assimilate a heavy diet of flesh. It is\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom this very fact, the evenness of our teeth, the\n\t\t\t\t\tsmallness of our mouths, the softness of our tongues,\n\t\t\t\t\tour possession of vital fluids too inert to digest meat\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Nature disavows our eating of flesh. If you\n\t\t\t\t\tdeclare that you are naturally designed for such a\n\t\t\t\t\tdiet, then first kill for yourself what you want to eat.\n\t\t\t\t\tDo it, however, only through your own resources,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tunaided by cleaver or cudgel of any kind or axe.\n\t\t\t\t\tRather, just as wolves and bears and lions themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tslay what they eat, so you are to fell an ox with your\n\t\t\t\t\tfangs or a boar with your jaws, or tear a lamb or\n\t\t\t\t\thare in bits. Fall upon it and eat it still living, as\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals do. But if you wait for what you eat to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdead, if you have qualms about enjoying the flesh\n\t\t\t\t\twhile life is still present, why do you continue,\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to nature, to eat what possesses life ? Even\n\t\t\t\t\twhen it is lifeless and dead, however, no one eats the\n\t\t\t\t\tflesh just as it is ; men boil it and roast it, altering\n\t\t\t\t\tit by fire and drugs, recasting and diverting and\n\t\t\t\t\tsmothering with countless condiments the taste of\n\t\t\t\t\tgore so that the palate may be deceived and accept\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is foreign to it."}, {"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf.

This doctrine, however, seems to be even older, for the stories told about\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sufferings and dismemberment of Dionysus and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe outrageous assaults of the Titans upon him, and\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir punishment and blasting by thunderbolt after\n\t\t\t\t\tthey had tasted his blood - all this is a myth which\n\t\t\t\t\tin its inner meaning has to do with rebirth.
