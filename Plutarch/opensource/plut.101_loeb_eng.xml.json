For\n\t\t\t\t\tin other diseases of the soul, such as love of money,\n\t\t\t\t\tlove of glory, love of pleasure, there is at least the\n\t\t\t\t\tpossibility of attaining their desires, but for babblers\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is very difficult: they desire listeners and cannot\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tget them, since every one runs away headlong. If\n\t\t\t\t\tmen are sitting in a public lounge or strolling about\n\t\t\t\t\tin a portico, and see a talker coming up, they\n\t\t\t\t\tquickly give each other the counter-sign to break\n\t\t\t\t\tcamp.

And so it is a talker's lot\n\t\t\t\t\twhen travelling by land or sea, to find volunteer\n\t\t\t\t\tlisteners neither as table-companions nor as tentmates, but only conscripts; for the talker is at\n\t\t\t\t\tyou everywhere, catching your cloak, plucking your\n\t\t\t\t\tbeard, digging you in the ribs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tas Archilochus says, and on my word the wise Aristotle will agree.

Therefore talkers do\n\t\t\t\t\tnot find it easy to secure listeners who either pay\n\t\t\t\t\tattention or believe what they say ; for just as they\n\t\t\t\t\taffirm that the seed of persons too prone to lusts\n\t\t\t\t\tof the flesh is barren, so is the speech of babblers\n\t\t\t\t\tineffectual and fruitless."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "3", "p": {"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf.

For in a race the victory is\n\t\t\t\t\this who comes in first; but here, if another makes a\n\t\t\t\t\tsufficient answer, it is proper to join in the approval\n\t\t\t\t\tand assent and so acquire the reputation of being a\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendly fellow.

And, in particular, let us be on our guard,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen someone else has been asked a question, that we\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not forestall him by taking the answer out of his\n\t\t\t\t\tmouth. For perhaps there are other times also when\n\t\t\t\t\tit is not seemly, another having been asked, to\n\t\t\t\t\tshoulder him aside and volunteer ourselves, since we\n\t\t\t\t\tshall seem to be casting a slur both on the man asked,\n\t\t\t\t\tas being unable to furnish what is demanded of him,\n\t\t\t\t\tand on the asker, as being ignorant of the source from\n\t\t\t\t\twhich he can get help ; and, in particular, such precipitancy and boldness in answering questions smacks\n\t\t\t\t\tof insolence. For one who tries to get in the answTer\n\t\t\t\t\tahead of the man who is questioned suggests,  or  or\n\t\t\t\t\t And yet we often ask people\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions, not because we need an answer, but to elicit\n\t\t\t\t\tsome friendly word from them, and because we wish\n\t\t\t\t\tto draw them on to friendly converse, as Socrates did\n\t\t\t\t\twith Theaetetus and Charmides. So to take the\n\t\t\t\t\tanswer out of another's mouth, to divert another's\n\t\t\t\t\thearing and attract his attention and wrest it from\n\t\t\t\t\tsome other, is as bad as to run up and kiss someone\n\t\t\t\t\twho wished to be kissed by somebody else, or to turn\n\t\t\t\t\ttoward yourself someone who was looking at another;\n\t\t\t\t\tsince, even if he who has been asked cannot give the\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tinformation, it is proper to practise restraint and\n\t\t\t\t\tconform oneself to the wish of the asker and thus to\n\t\t\t\t\tencounter with modesty and decorum the situation,\n\t\t\t\t\tan invitation, as it were, given to another. And\n\t\t\t\t\tit is also true that if persons who are asked questions\n\t\t\t\t\tmake mistakes in their answers, they meet with just\n\t\t\t\t\tindulgence ; but he who voluntarily undertakes an\n\t\t\t\t\tanswer and anticipates another is unpleasant even if\n\t\t\t\t\the corrects a mistake, and if he makes a mistake\n\t\t\t\t\thimself, he affords a malicious joy to one and all, and\n\t\t\t\t\tbecomes an object of ridicule."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "20", "p": {"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf.
