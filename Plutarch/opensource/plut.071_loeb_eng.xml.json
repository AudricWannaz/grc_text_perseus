So, too, in the case of a sick man, a course of treatment that should\n\t\t\t\t\tnot in some way effect an easing and alleviation of the malady, by making it to\n\t\t\t\t\tyield and let go its hold on him, would not afford him any perception of a\n\t\t\t\t\tchange for the better until the opposite condition had been unmistakably\n\t\t\t\t\tengendered, his body having completely recovered its strength. On the contrary,\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as in these cases persons make no progress unless their progress is marked\n\t\t\t\t\tby such an abatement of what is oppressing them, that, when the scale turns  and they swing upward in the opposite direction, they can\n\t\t\t\t\tnote the change, so too, in the study of philosophy, neither progress nor any\n\t\t\t\t\tsense of progress is to be assumed, if the soul does not put aside any of its\n\t\t\t\t\tgross stupidity and purge itself thereof, and if, up to the moment of its\n\t\t\t\t\tattaining the absolute and perfect good, it is wedded to evil which is also\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolute. Why, if this be so, the wise man in a moment or a second of time\n\t\t\t\t\tchanges from the lowest possible depravity to an unsurpassable state of virtue ;\n\t\t\t\t\tand all his vice, of which he has not in long years succeeded in removing even a\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall portion, he suddenly leaves behind for ever. Yet you doubtless know that,\n\t\t\t\t\ton the other hand, the authors of such assertions make for themselves much\n\t\t\t\t\ttrouble and great difficulties over the unwitting man, who has as yet failed to\n\t\t\t\t\tapprehend the fact that he has become wise, but does not know, and hesitates to\n\t\t\t\t\tbelieve, that his advancement, which has been effected by the gradual and\n\t\t\t\t\tlongcontinued process of divesting himself of some qualities and adding others,\n\t\t\t\t\thas, as walking brings one where he would be, imperceptibly and quietly brought\n\t\t\t\t\thim into virtue's company. But if there were such a swiftness in the change and\n\t\t\t\t\ta difference so vast, that the man who was the very worst in the morning should\n\t\t\t\t\thave become the very best at evening, or should the change so come about that he\n\t\t\t\t\twho was a worthless dolt when he fell asleep should awake wise, and, having\n\t\t\t\t\tdismissed from his soul his gross stupidities and false concepts of yesterday,\n\t\t\t\t\tcould exclaim :  \n                \u2014who would fail to recognize that a great difference like\n\t\t\t\t\tthis had been wrought in his own self, and that the light of wisdom had all at\n\t\t\t\t\tonce burst upon him ?

We do not, therefore, think that consciousness of the\n\t\t\t\t\tchange is unreasonable in the case of persons who are, as it were, making their\n\t\t\t\t\tway upward out of some deep gorge, but that there are ways in which it can be\n\t\t\t\t\tcomputed. Of these I beg you to consider the first without further preface. Just\n\t\t\t\t\tas men sailing out into the open sea calculate their run by the time elapsed in\n\t\t\t\t\tconjunction with the strength of the wind, reckoning how much distance, after\n\t\t\t\t\tspending a certain time, while carried onward by a certain force, they are\n\t\t\t\t\tlikely to have accomplished ; so too in philosophy a man may take for himself as\n\t\t\t\t\ta proof that he is gaining ground the uniformity and continuity of his course,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich makes on the way no frequent halts, followed by leaps and bounds, but\n\t\t\t\t\tsmoothly and regularly forges ahead, and goes through the course of philosophic\n\t\t\t\t\treasoning without mishap. For the lines :  are not merely well put in regard to the increase of  money, but they apply to everything, and especially to\n\t\t\t\t\tadvancement in virtue, since reason thereby gains the aid of constant and\n\t\t\t\t\teffective habit. But the variation and obtuseness often shown by students of\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy not only cause delays and stoppages in their progress on the road to\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge, but also bring about retrogressions, since vice always makes an onset\n\t\t\t\t\ton the man who yields ground by loitering, and carries him backward in the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite direction. Mathematicians tell us that the planets, when their forward\n\t\t\t\t\tmovement ceases, become for the moment stationary, but in the study of\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy there is no intermission when progress halts, nor any such thing as\n\t\t\t\t\tremaining stationary, but Nature, being never free from motion of some sort, is\n\t\t\t\t\twont to move up or down, as though suspended on a balance, and to be swayed by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe better motives, or else under the influence of the contrary motives it moves\n\t\t\t\t\trapidly towards what is worse. If therefore you follow the advice given by the\n\t\t\t\t\tgod in the oracle, to  and are conscious that you likewise in the daytime and the\n\t\t\t\t\tnighttime have always carried on an unrelenting warfare against vice, or at\n\t\t\t\t\tleast that you have not often relaxed your vigilance nor constantly granted\n\t\t\t\t\tadmission to divers pleasures, recreations, and pastimes, which are, as it were,\n\t\t\t\t\tenvoys sent by vice to treat for a truce, it is then quite probable that you may\n\t\t\t\t\tgo on with good courage and confidence to what still remains."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "4", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.411"}, {"@id": "v1.p.413"}], "note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Somer editors would amen the text here, and perhaps rightly, to make the text correspond better to what the sense plainly requires."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Iliad"}, "#text": "Homer, , xix. 386."}], "q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "is again given wings"}, "quote": {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Trag.

We may compare a reed, the growth of which at its\n\t\t\t\t\tbeginning has a very great impetus, which results in an even and continuous\n\t\t\t\t\tlength, at first in long sections, since it meets with few obstacles and\n\t\t\t\t\trepulses, but later, as though for lack of breath as it gets higher up, it grows\n\t\t\t\t\tweak and weary, and is gathered up in the many frequent nodules, when the\n\t\t\t\t\tlife-giving spirit meets with buffets and shocks ; so with philosophy, those who\n\t\t\t\t\tat the outset engage in long excursions into its realms and later meet with a\n\t\t\t\t\tlong series of obstacles and distractions without becoming aware of any change\n\t\t\t\t\ttoward the better, finally get wearied out, and give up.

In the same way that an indication of the beginning of love is to be\n\t\t\t\t\tfound, not in the taking delight in the presence of the loved one (for this is\n\t\t\t\t\tusual), but in feeling a sting of pain when separated ; just so are many allured\n\t\t\t\t\tby philosophy and seem to take hold of the task of learning with high\n\t\t\t\t\taspirations, but if they are forced by other business and occupations to leave\n\t\t\t\t\tit, all that excitement of theirs subsides and they no longer care.

For we ought not to enjoy being present at discussions as we\n\t\t\t\t\tenjoy the presence of perfumes, and then when we are removed from them not seek\n\t\t\t\t\tafter them or even feel uneasy ; but we ought in our periods of separation to\n\t\t\t\t\texperience a sensation akin in a way to hunger and thirst, and so be led to\n\t\t\t\t\tcleave to what makes for real progress, whether it chance to be a wedding or\n\t\t\t\t\twealth or the duties of friendship or military service that causes the temporary\n\t\t\t\t\tparting.

Of\n\t\t\t\t\tno slight significance either is the change which occurs in one's discourse. For\n\t\t\t\t\tpractically all beginners in philosophy are more inclined to pursue those forms\n\t\t\t\t\tof discourse which make for repute ; some of these beginners, like birds, are\n\t\t\t\t\tled by their flightiness and ambition to alight on the resplendent heights of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Natural Sciences; while others,  as Plato puts it,  go in for the disputations, knotty\n\t\t\t\t\tproblems, and quibbles ; but the majority enter a course in Logic and\n\t\t\t\t\tArgumentation, where they straightway stock themselves up for the practice of\n\t\t\t\t\tsophistry ; while a few go about making a collection of apophthegms and\n\t\t\t\t\tanecdotes, but, as Anacharsis said of the Greeks that he never saw them put\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir money to any use  save to count it, so these persons\n\t\t\t\t\tare for ever foolishly taking account and inventory of their literary stock, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthey lay up nothing else which would be to their own profit. Quite in place here\n\t\t\t\t\tis Antiphanes'  story, which somebody has recounted and applied to Plato's\n\t\t\t\t\tclose acquaintances. Antiphanes said humorously that in a certain city words\n\t\t\t\t\tcongealed with the cold the moment they were spoken, and later, as they thawed\n\t\t\t\t\tout, people heard in the summer what they had said to one another in the winter\n\t\t\t\t\t; it was the same way, he asserted, with what was said by Plato to men still in\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir youth ; not until long afterwards, if ever, did most of them come to\n\t\t\t\t\tperceive the meaning, when they had become old men. And this is the general\n\t\t\t\t\texperience with philosophy as a whole until the judgement acquires a healthy\n\t\t\t\t\tstability, and begins to find itself in accord with principles productive of\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter and breadth of mind, and to look for the kind of discourse whose\n\t\t\t\t\tfootprints, in the words of Aesop,  are turned toward us rather than away from\n\t\t\t\t\tus. For as Sophocles said, that only after handling with a light touch the\n\t\t\t\t\tturgidity of Aeschylus and next his harshness and artificiality in composition,\n\t\t\t\t\tdid he, as a third step, change the character of the language, which has the\n\t\t\t\t\tmost to do with moral character and goodness, so, in the same way, when students\n\t\t\t\t\tof philosophy pass from the ostentatious and artificial to the kind of discourse\n\t\t\t\t\twhich deals with character and feeling they begin to make real and unaffected\n\t\t\t\t\tprogress."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "8", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.423"}, {"@id": "v1.p.425"}, {"@id": "v1.p.427"}], "note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Poet.

For as Simonides \n\t\t\t\t\tsays of the bee that it flits among the flowers,  while the rest of the world contents itself with their colour and\n\t\t\t\t\tfragrance, getting nothing else from them, so, while the rest of the world\n\t\t\t\t\tranges amid poems for the sake of pleasure or diversion, if a man, through his\n\t\t\t\t\town initiative, finds and collects something worth while, it is reasonable to\n\t\t\t\t\texpect that he at last, from force of habit and fondness for what is beautiful\n\t\t\t\t\tand appropriate, has made himself capable of appreciating it. In the case, for\n\t\t\t\t\texample, of persons who make use of Plato and Xenophon for their language, and\n\t\t\t\t\tgather therefrom nothing else but the purity of the Attic style, like dew and\n\t\t\t\t\tbloom, what can you say of them, save that they are the sort of persons that\n\t\t\t\t\tcontent themselves with the sweet odour and bouquet of medicines, but have no\n\t\t\t\t\tdesire for their sedative and purgative virtues, nor the power to discern them ?\n\t\t\t\t\tBut those who are making still more and more progress are always able to derive\n\t\t\t\t\tbenefit, not only from what is said, but also from what is seen and done, and to\n\t\t\t\t\tgather what is appropriate and useful therefrom.  Examples\n\t\t\t\t\tare found in the stories told of Aeschylus and of others like him. Aeschylus at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Isthmian games was watching a boxing-match, and when one of the men was hit\n\t\t\t\t\tthe crowd in the theatre burst into a roar. Aeschylus nudged Ion of Chios, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid,  \n                Brasidas caught a mouse among\n\t\t\t\t\tsome dried figs, got bitten, and let it go ; thereupon he said to himself,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n                Diogenes  at the first\n\t\t\t\t\tsight of a man drinking from his hands took his cup from his wallet and threw it\n\t\t\t\t\taway. Thus attention and intense application makes persons perceptive and\n\t\t\t\t\treceptive of anything that conduces to virtue, from whatever source it come.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is more apt to be the case if they combine theory with practice, not only,\n\t\t\t\t\tas Thucydides  said, \n\t\t\t\t\tbut also when confronted by pleasures or contentions, and when busy over\n\t\t\t\t\tlawsuits and pleadings at court and the conduct of public offices, thus, as it\n\t\t\t\t\twere, giving themselves a demonstration of their convictions, or rather arriving\n\t\t\t\t\tat their convictions by putting them to a practical test; whereas, those who are\n\t\t\t\t\tstill studying, and busily looking to see what they can get from philosophy\n\t\t\t\t\twhich they can straightway haul out for display in the Forum, or at a gathering\n\t\t\t\t\tof young men, or at an evening party at Court, ought not to be thought to\n\t\t\t\t\tpractise philosophy any more than apothecaries are to be thought to practise\n\t\t\t\t\tmedicine ; or rather, a charlatan of this sort does not \n\t\t\t\t\t differ at all from the bird described by Homer,  for\n\t\t\t\t\twhatever he gets he proffers through the mouth to his pupils as to an  \n                if he does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot devote to his own advantage, or assimilate at all, anything of what he\n\t\t\t\t\treceives."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "9", "p": {"q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "For all that I have been defeated I am going home to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenjoy a sweeter sleep than you who have defeated me."}, "pb": {"@id": "v1.p.429"}, "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Traditionally the reference is to *phlhia/dew"}, "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Iliad"}, "#text": "It is therefore imperative that we consider carefully whether, as for ourselves,\n\t\t\t\t\twe employ our discourse for our own improvement, and whether, as it affects\n\t\t\t\t\tothers, we employ it, not for the sake of momentary repute, nor from motives of\n\t\t\t\t\tambition, but rather with the wish to hear and to impart something ; but most of\n\t\t\t\t\tall must we consider whether the spirit of contention and quarrelling over\n\t\t\t\t\tdebatable questions has been put down, and whether we have ceased to equip\n\t\t\t\t\tourselves with arguments, as with boxing-gloves or brass knuckles, with which to\n\t\t\t\t\tcontend against one another, and to take more delight in scoring a hit or a\n\t\t\t\t\tknockout than in learning and imparting something. For reasonableness and\n\t\t\t\t\tmildness in such matters, and the ability to join in discussions without\n\t\t\t\t\twrangling, and to close them without anger, and to avoid a sort of arrogance\n\t\t\t\t\tover success in argument and exasperation over defeat, are the marks of a man\n\t\t\t\t\twho is making adequate progress. Aristippus made this clear when he was once\n\t\t\t\t\toutwitted in an argument by a man who had plenty of assurance, but was otherwise\n\t\t\t\t\tfoolish and flighty. For seeing that the man was rejoicing and in great conceit,\n\t\t\t\t\tAristippus said,  It is possible\n\t\t\t\t\talso in the practice of speaking to  take some measure of\n\t\t\t\t\tourselves, if, when a large audience has unexpectedly assembled, we do not\n\t\t\t\t\tsuffer from stage-fright, and if we are not dispirited when arguing in the\n\t\t\t\t\tpresence of a small number ; and if, when the need has arisen to speak before\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people or a magistrate, we do not let the occasion slip through lack of time\n\t\t\t\t\tto put our discourse into orderly form, as is told, for instance, of Demosthenes\n\t\t\t\t\tand Alcibiades. For the latter, although most keen in thinking out his subject\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter, yet because of a certain lack of confidence about his manner of\n\t\t\t\t\tspeaking, used to interrupt himself in the midst of his subject, and oftentimes,\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough his quest and pursuit of an elusive word or phrase while actually\n\t\t\t\t\tengaged in speaking, he made a flat failure. But Homer felt no repugnance\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst making the very first of his lines unmetrical; , , i. 1. so abounding was his\n\t\t\t\t\tconfidence regarding the rest on account of his ability. It is rather to be\n\t\t\t\t\texpected, therefore, that those whose strivings are towards virtue and honour\n\t\t\t\t\twill avail themselves of the occasion and the subject, and give least thought to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe shouting and applause that may be called forth by their manner of speaking."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "10", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.431"}, {"@id": "v1.p.433"}, {"@id": "v1.p.435"}], "q": [{"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "Look at me, Dionysia ; I\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave stopped being conceited"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "becoming accustomed to find within himself the sources of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenjoyment."}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "humble and orderly attends upon"}], "note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Agesilaus"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Moralia"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Life of Agesilaus"}], "#text": "Xenophon, , 5. 4;  also Plutarch, , 31 C, 209 D, and , chap. xi.

Take, for example, the case of the man who in his own\n\t\t\t\t\thouse called his maidservant and cried out,  ; very much like this is the behaviour\n\t\t\t\t\tof the man who performs some gracious and civil action, and then by telling\n\t\t\t\t\tabout it and circulating it everywhere makes it clear that he is still looking\n\t\t\t\t\tbeyond himself, and is still attracted toward repute, and that he has not yet\n\t\t\t\t\thad even a glimpse of virtue, nay, that he is not really awake but only dreaming\n\t\t\t\t\tas he roams about amid the shadows and phantoms of virtue, and afterwards puts\n\t\t\t\t\twhat he has done on view like a painting. It is therefore the mark of a man who\n\t\t\t\t\tis making progress, not only when he has given to a friend or done a kindness to\n\t\t\t\t\tan acquaintance to refrain from telling of it to others, but also when he has\n\t\t\t\t\tgiven an honest judgement amidst a numerous and dishonest majority, when he has\n\t\t\t\t\tperemptorily declined a discreditable conference with some rich man or some\n\t\t\t\t\tofficial, when he has scorned bribes, and even when he has felt a craving in the\n\t\t\t\t\tnight for a drink and has not taken it, or when he has fought a good fight, like\n\t\t\t\t\tAgesilaus,  against a kiss of a lovely girl or youth, to keep all this to\n\t\t\t\t\thimself and put the seal of silence on it. In fact, such a man, by standing well\n\t\t\t\t\tin his own estimation, inasmuch as he feels no disdain, but only pleasure and\n\t\t\t\t\tsatisfaction at the thought that he is at the same time a competent witness and\n\t\t\t\t\tobserver of honourable deeds, shows that reason is already growing within him\n\t\t\t\t\tand taking root in his own self, and, in the words of Democritus,  that he is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t           Farmers take more pleasure in looking at the heads of grain\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are bent over and bowed toward the ground, but those that tower aloft owing\n\t\t\t\t\tto their lightness the farmers think are empty cheats ; so among the young men\n\t\t\t\t\twho would study philosophy : those who are most empty and have no weight, have\n\t\t\t\t\tassurance and a pose and a gait, and a countenance filled with a haughtiness and\n\t\t\t\t\tdisdain which spares nobody ; but, as their heads begin to fill and to\n\t\t\t\t\taccumulate some fruitage from their lectures and reading, they lay aside their\n\t\t\t\t\tswagger and superficiality. And just as when empty vessels are being filled with\n\t\t\t\t\ta liquid the air inside is expelled by the pressure, so when men are being\n\t\t\t\t\tfilled with the really good things, their conceit gives way and their\n\t\t\t\t\tself-opinion becomes less inflexible ; and, ceasing to feel pride in their\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosopher's beard and gown, they transfer their training to their mind, and\n\t\t\t\t\tapply their stinging and bitter criticism most of all to themselves, and are\n\t\t\t\t\tmilder in their intercourse with others. They do not arrogate to themselves, as\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore, the name of philosophy and the repute of studying it, or even give\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves the title of philosopher ; in fact, a young man of good parts, on\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing addressed by this title by another, would be quick to say with a blush :  For as Aeschylus \n\t\t\t\t\tputs it:  \n                but with the young man who has had a taste of\n\t\t\t\t\treal progress in philosophy, these words of Sappho  are always associated : \n\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless, you will see an eye untroubled and serene, and you would yearn to\n\t\t\t\t\thear him speak. Just as persons who are being initiated into the Mysteries\n\t\t\t\t\tthrong together at the outset amid tumult and shouting, and jostle against one\n\t\t\t\t\tanother, but when the holy rites are being performed and disclosed the people\n\t\t\t\t\tare immediately attentive in awe and silence, so too at the beginning of\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy ; about its portals also you will see great tumult and talking and\n\t\t\t\t\tboldness, as some boorishly and violently try to jostle their way towards the\n\t\t\t\t\trepute it bestows : but he who has succeeded in getting inside, and has seen a\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat light, as though a shrine were opened, adopts another bearing of silence\n\t\t\t\t\tand amazement, and  \n                reason as\n\t\t\t\t\tupon a god. To these the humorous remark of Menedemus may, as it seems, be\n\t\t\t\t\tnicely applied ; for he said that the multitudes who came to Athens to school\n\t\t\t\t\twere, at the outset, wise ; later they became lovers of wisdom, later still\n\t\t\t\t\torators, and, as time went on, just ordinary persons, and the more they laid\n\t\t\t\t\thold on reason the more they laid aside their selfopinion and conceit."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "11", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.437"}, {"@id": "v1.p.439"}, {"@id": "v1.p.441"}], "note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Moralia"}, "#text": "Again referred to, , 74 C, and in 89 B it is ascribed to Antisthenes."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Moralia"}, "#text": "According to Plutarch, , 847 F, and Diogenes Laertius, vi. 2. 34, the young man was Demosthenes the orator."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Epist."}], "q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "To Dionysius"}, "#text": "Hippocrates' Works, ed.

And for a man who is in\n\t\t\t\t\terror to submit himself to those who take him to task, to tell what is the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter with him, to disclose his depravity, and not to rejoice in hiding his\n\t\t\t\t\tfault or to take satisfaction in its not being known, but to confess it, and to\n\t\t\t\t\tfeel the need of somebody to take him in hand and admonish him, is no slight\n\t\t\t\t\tindication of progress. So Diogenes  has somewhere said that, as a matter of\n\t\t\t\t\tself-preservation, a man should be concerned to find either an earnest friend or\n\t\t\t\t\tan ardent enemy, so that either by stern reprehension or by kindly attention he\n\t\t\t\t\tmay escape vice. But just so long as a man, displaying a spot or a stain on his\n\t\t\t\t\tgarment or a rip in his shoe, puts on airs in public by affecting a silly\n\t\t\t\t\tunconcern for such matters, or, by passing some jest about himself for being\n\t\t\t\t\tdwarfed or humpbacked, imagines that he is thus showing a spirit of youthful\n\t\t\t\t\tbravado, while, at the same time, the inward ugliness of his soul, the\n\t\t\t\t\tdespicable acts of his life, his displays of pettiness or love of pleasure or\n\t\t\t\t\tmalice or envy, he covers up and conceals as though they were ulcerous sores,\n\t\t\t\t\tand allows nobody to touch them or even see them because of his fear of being\n\t\t\t\t\t\t reprehended for them\u2014such a man's part in progress is\n\t\t\t\t\tlittle, or rather none at all. But the man who grapples with these faults,\n\t\t\t\t\tespecially if he shows himself able and willing to make himself unhappy and\n\t\t\t\t\twretched over his errors, and, next to that, to submit to another's admonitions\n\t\t\t\t\twithout flinching, and with a spirit made purer by such reproofs\u2014such a man\n\t\t\t\t\ttruly has every appearance of trying to divest himself of baseness and of\n\t\t\t\t\tabominating it. Beyond all question, anyone ought to have enough selfrespect to\n\t\t\t\t\tavoid even giving the impression of being bad; but the man who is more disturbed\n\t\t\t\t\tover the actual existence of baseness than over any ill-repute does not try to\n\t\t\t\t\tavoid uncomplimentary remarks to himself, or replying to them, when this may be\n\t\t\t\t\tmade a means of improvement. Very neat was the remark made by Diogenes to a\n\t\t\t\t\tyoung man,  who, being seen at a tavern, fled for refuge within.  said he,  And so of low things, the more each man denies, just so much\n\t\t\t\t\tthe deeper does he become involved in vice, and cut off his escape therefrom.\n\t\t\t\t\tSo, too, it is that among poor people those who make a show of being rich are\n\t\t\t\t\teven poorer because of their pretension ; but the man who is making true\n\t\t\t\t\tprogress takes as his example Hippocrates,  who published and recorded his\n\t\t\t\t\tfailure to apprehend the facts about the cranial sutures ; for such a man\n\t\t\t\t\taccounts it a dreadful thing, that here was Hippocrates who declared his own\n\t\t\t\t\terror so that others should not repeat his experience, and yet he himself, a man\n\t\t\t\t\tbent on saving his soul alive, should not have the courage to submit to\n\t\t\t\t\t  being taken to task, and to confess his fatuity and ignorance. Indeed the\n\t\t\t\t\tdeclarations of Bion and Pyrrho might be construed as indication, not merely of\n\t\t\t\t\tprogress, but rather of a higher state of mind and one which comes nearer to the\n\t\t\t\t\tideal. Bion said to his intimate friends that they might well be justified in\n\t\t\t\t\tthinking that they were making progress when they could listen to their revilers\n\t\t\t\t\tas though they heard them say ;  And the story about Pyrrho is that when he was on a\n\t\t\t\t\tvoyage, and in peril during a storm, he pointed to a little pig contentedly\n\t\t\t\t\tfeeding upon some barley which had been spilled near by, and said to his\n\t\t\t\t\tcompanions that a similar indifference must be acquired from reason and\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy by the man who does not wish to be disturbed by anything that may\n\t\t\t\t\tbefall him."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "12", "p": {"note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Republic"}, "#text": ", 571 D; the entire passage should be compared."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Republic"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Moralia"}], "#text": "Plato, , 571 C, and Plutarch, , 100 F."}], "pb": {"@id": "v1.p.443"}, "q": [{"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "It attempts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincest,"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "pb": {"@id": "v1.p.445"}, "#text": "What are you saying,  Poseidon ?

For he said that every man might\n\t\t\t\t\tfairly derive from his dreams a consciousness that he was making progress if he\n\t\t\t\t\tobserved that during his period of sleep he felt no pleasure in anything\n\t\t\t\t\tdisgraceful, and did not tolerate or commit any dreadful or untoward action, but\n\t\t\t\t\tas though in the clear depth of an absolute calm there came over him the radiant\n\t\t\t\t\tthought that the fanciful and emotional element in his soul had been dispelled\n\t\t\t\t\tby reason. Plato,  apparently realizing this even earlier, has given form and\n\t\t\t\t\texpression to the operations of the fanciful and irrational element in a\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally despotic soul  during sleep.  and feels a sudden hunger for a great variety of food,\n\t\t\t\t\tacting in lawless fashion, and giving loose rein to the desires which in the\n\t\t\t\t\tdaytime the law keeps confined by means of shame and fear. Now well-trained\n\t\t\t\t\tbeasts of burden, even if their driver lets go the reins, do not attempt to turn\n\t\t\t\t\taside and leave the road, but in their accustomed manner they go on in their\n\t\t\t\t\tplaces and keep to their course without mishap ; and so it is in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons in whom the irrational impulse has already been rendered obedient and\n\t\t\t\t\tgentle by reason and has been thoroughly chastened ; neither during sleep nor as\n\t\t\t\t\ta result of illness is it willing any longer to indulge readily in arrogance or\n\t\t\t\t\tlawlessness because of the desires, but it observes and bears in mind the habit\n\t\t\t\t\tit has acquired, and it is this which endows our vigilance with strength and\n\t\t\t\t\tintensity. For if the body by virtue of training is actually capable of\n\t\t\t\t\trendering itself and its members so obedient to its injunctions of indifference\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the eyes refrain from tears at a piteous sight, and the heart from\n\t\t\t\t\tthrobbing in the midst of terrors, and the passions chastely remain unexcited\n\t\t\t\t\tand undisturbed in the presence of youthful or maidenly beauty, is it not indeed\n\t\t\t\t\teven more probable that training, by taking hold of the emotional element in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsoul, will, as it were, do away with the irregularities and vagaries of our\n\t\t\t\t\tfancies and incitements, and carry its repression of them even into our slumbers\n\t\t\t\t\t? There is a story, illustrating this point, about the philosopher Stilpo, who\n\t\t\t\t\tthought in his slumber that he saw Poseidon, who was angry at him for not having\n\t\t\t\t\toffered up a bull, which was the customary sacrifice; but he himself, in his\n\t\t\t\t\tdream, nowise disconcerted, replied,  And\n\t\t\t\t\tthen it seemed to him that Poseidon smiled and held out his hand, and said that\n\t\t\t\t\the would send an abundance of anchovies to the Megarians for Stilpo's sake. So\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of persons blessed with dreams so pleasant and bright and\n\t\t\t\t\tuntroubled, who experience in their hours of slumber no revival of anything\n\t\t\t\t\tterrifying or repellent nor of any act of malice or improbity, men like Zeno\n\t\t\t\t\tassert that such manifestations are bright reflections of their progress, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthat torturing memories, perturbations, ignoble desertions, and childish\n\t\t\t\t\ttransports of joy and sorrow, such as are experienced in dismal or abnormal\n\t\t\t\t\tdreams, are like to billows that break and toss, inasmuch as the soul does not\n\t\t\t\t\tyet possess the power to keep itself in order, but is still being moulded by\n\t\t\t\t\texternal opinions and laws, and when it gets farthest away from these during the\n\t\t\t\t\thours of slumber, it is again made free and open to other influences by the\n\t\t\t\t\temotions.  I beg, therefore, that you also will consider whether these things\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to progress in virtue, or to a state of mind already possessed of a\n\t\t\t\t\tconstancy and strength based on reason, and hence unwavering."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "13", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "v1.p.447"}, "note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Moralia"}, "#text": "Repeated in , 220 C, with some change."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Trag.

We must compare them with their\n\t\t\t\t\tformer selves, to see whether the desires and fears and angry passions  which we experience to-day are less intense than they used\n\t\t\t\t\tto be, inasmuch as we, by means of reason, are rapidly getting rid of the cause\n\t\t\t\t\tthat kindles and inflames them ; and we must compare them with one another, to\n\t\t\t\t\tsee whether now we are more inclined to feel shame than fear, to be emulous\n\t\t\t\t\trather than envious, more eager for good repute than for money, and, in general,\n\t\t\t\t\twhether, in case we err by going to extremes, we, after the manner of musicians,\n\t\t\t\t\tincline to the severity of the Dorian key rather than to the softness of the\n\t\t\t\t\tLydian, as shown by our being strict rather than lax in our mode of life, and\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberate rather than precipitate in our actions, and given to expressing undue\n\t\t\t\t\tadmiration rather than contempt of doctrines and persons.

An\n\t\t\t\t\tindication of this is, in the first place, the desire to emulate what we\n\t\t\t\t\tcommend, eagerness to do what we admire, and, on the other hand, unwillingness\n\t\t\t\t\tto do, or even to tolerate, what we censure. For example, it was to be expected\n\t\t\t\t\tthat all the Athenians should commend the daring and bravery of Miltiades, yet\n\t\t\t\t\tthe remark of Themistocles  that the trophy of Miltiades would not suffer him\n\t\t\t\t\tto sleep, but roused him from his slumbers, made it plain at once that he was\n\t\t\t\t\tnot merely commending and admiring, but emulating and imitating as well. We must\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore believe we are making but little progress so long as the admiration\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we feel for successful men remains inert within us and does not of its own\n\t\t\t\t\tself stir us to imitation. In fact, love for a person is not active unless there\n\t\t\t\t\tis some jealousy with it, nor is that commendation of virtue ardent and\n\t\t\t\t\tefficacious which does not prod and prick us, and create in us not envy but an\n\t\t\t\t\temulation over honourable things which strives earnestly for satisfaction. For\n\t\t\t\t\tnot only, as Alcibiades  used to say, must the heart feel such anguish at the\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosopher's words that tears will flow ; but more than that, the man who is\n\t\t\t\t\ttruly making progress, comparing himself with the deeds and conduct of a good\n\t\t\t\t\tand perfect man, and being pricked by the consciousness of his own shortcomings,\n\t\t\t\t\tyet at the same time rejoicing because of his hope and yearning, and being\n\t\t\t\t\tfilled with an urging that is never still, is ready in the words of Simonides \n\t\t\t\t\t           so great is his craving all but to\n\t\t\t\t\tmerge his own identity in that of the good man. Indeed a peculiar  symptom of true progress is found in this feeling of love\n\t\t\t\t\tand affection for the disposition shown by those whose deeds we try to emulate,\n\t\t\t\t\tand in the fact that our efforts to make ourselves like them are always attended\n\t\t\t\t\tby a goodwill which accords to them a fair meed of honour. But, on the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand, if any man is imbued with a spirit of contentiousness and envy towards his\n\t\t\t\t\tbetters, let him understand that he is merely chafing with jealousy at another's\n\t\t\t\t\trepute or power, but not honouring or even admiring virtue."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "15", "p": {"note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Laws"}, "#text": "Plato, , 711 E."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Republic"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Moralia"}], "#text": "An echo from Plato, , 474 E, which Plutarch cites more fully in , 45 A and 56 C."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cyropaedia"}, "#text": "Xenophon, , v. 1. 2, and vi. 1. 31."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Life of Aristeides"}, "#text": "See Plutarch, , chap. vii.

For just as those who have given up the hope of ever being rich\n\t\t\t\t\tmake nothing of their small expenditures, with the idea that whatever is added\n\t\t\t\t\tto a little will make nothing great,  whereas Hope as it draws nearer to its\n\t\t\t\t\tgoal joins hands with wealth in increasing the desire for wealth, so it is with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe activities which bear upon virtue : the man who does not acquiesce much in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sentiments  and  but who gives heed\n\t\t\t\t\tto each separate thing, and is impatient and vexed if vice ever finds its way\n\t\t\t\t\tinto the most insignificant of his errors and suggests a reason for condoning\n\t\t\t\t\tit\u2014this man already shows plainly that he is winning for himself a spotless\n\t\t\t\t\ttreasure and that he scorns to sully himself in any way whatever. On the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand, to imagine that nothing can cause any great disgrace, or can even be of\n\t\t\t\t\tany great importance, makes men easy-going and careless about little things.\n\t\t\t\t\tTrue enough, it makes no difference, when men are building some rough wall which\n\t\t\t\t\tis to have a coping, whether they throw into the foundation a chance piece of\n\t\t\t\t\ttimber or a stone picked up from the ground, or whether they put into the lower\n\t\t\t\t\tcourses a fallen slab from some tomb, the same sort of thing that moral slovens\n\t\t\t\t\tdo when they bring together promiscuously and accumulate actions and conduct of\n\t\t\t\t\tevery kind ; but those who are making progress, of whose life already, as of\n\t\t\t\t\tsome holy temple or regal palace,  do\n\t\t\t\t\tnot indiscriminately accept for it a single action, but, using reason to guide\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, they bring each one into place and fit it where it belongs. And we may\n\t\t\t\t\twell conceive that Polycleitus had this in mind when he said that the task is\n\t\t\t\t\thardest for those whose clay has reached the stage when they must use the\n\t\t\t\t\tfinger-nail."}}]}}}}
