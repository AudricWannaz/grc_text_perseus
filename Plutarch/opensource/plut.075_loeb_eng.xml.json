Yet it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult for any man to get rid of a bad wife if he be a real man and not a\n\t\t\t\t\tslave ; but against his own vice it is not possible to draw up a writing of\n\t\t\t\t\tdivorcement and forthwith to be rid of troubles and to be at peace, having\n\t\t\t\t\tarranged to be by himself. No, his vice, a settled tenant of his very vitals\n\t\t\t\t\talways, both at night and by day,  For in travelling vice is a troublesome\n\t\t\t\t\tcompanion because of arrogance, at dinner an expensive companion owing to\n\t\t\t\t\tgluttony, and a distressing bedfellow, since by anxieties, cares and\n\t\t\t\t\tjealousies it drives out and destroys sleep. For what slumber there may be\n\t\t\t\t\tis sleep and repose for the body only, but for the soul terrors, dreams, and\n\t\t\t\t\tagitations, because of superstition. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n                says one man. In such a state do envy, fear, temper, and\n\t\t\t\t\tlicentiousness put a man. For by day vice, looking outside of itself and\n\t\t\t\t\tconforming its attitude to others, is abashed and veils its emotions, and\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not give itself up completely to its impulses, but oftentimes resists\n\t\t\t\t\tthem and struggles against them ; but in the hours of slumber, when it has\n\t\t\t\t\tescaped from opinion and law, and got away as far as possible from feeling\n\t\t\t\t\tfear or shame, it sets every desire stirring, and awakens its depravity and\n\t\t\t\t\tlicentiousness. It  as Plato  says, partakes\n\t\t\t\t\tof forbidden meats, abstains from nothing which it wishes to do, but revels\n\t\t\t\t\tin lawlessness so far as it can, with images and visions which end in no\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure or accomplishment of desire, but have only the power to stir to\n\t\t\t\t\tfierce activity the emotional and morbid propensities."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "3", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "v.2.p.101"}, "#text": "Where, then, is the pleasure in vice, if in no part of it is to be found\n\t\t\t\t\tfreedom from care and grief, or contentment or tranquillity or calm ?
