And\n\t\t\t\t\twhen she separated the very hands into a number of\n\t\t\t\t\tunequal fingers, she supplied men with the most\n\t\t\t\t\taccurate and skilful of instruments, so that Anaxagoras of old assigned the reason for man's wisdom\n\t\t\t\t\tand intelligence to his having hands. The contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tof this, however, seems to be true: it is not because\n\t\t\t\t\tman acquired hands that he is wisest of animals ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tit is because by nature he was endowed with reason\n\t\t\t\t\tand skill that he acquired instruments of a nature\n\t\t\t\t\tadapted to these powers. And this fact is obvious to\n\t\t\t\t\teveryone : Nature from one seed and one source has\n\t\t\t\t\tcreated two brothers, or three, or more, not for\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference and opposition to each other, but that by\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing separate they might the more readily co-operate\n\t\t\t\t\twith one another. For indeed creatures that had\n\t\t\t\t\tthree bodies and an hundred hands, if any such were\n\t\t\t\t\tever really born, being joined together in all their\n\t\t\t\t\tmembers, could do nothing independently and apart\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom one another, as may brothers, who can either\n\t\t\t\t\tremain at home or reside abroad, as well as undertake\n\t\t\t\t\tpublic office and husbandry through each other's help\n\t\t\t\t\tif they but preserve that principle of goodwill and\n\t\t\t\t\tconcord which Nature has given them. But if they\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not, they will differ not at all, I think, from feet\n\t\t\t\t\twhich trip up one another and fingers which are unnaturally entwined and twisted by each other. But\n\t\t\t\t\trather, just as in the same body the combination of\n\t\t\t\t\tmoist and dry, cold and hot, sharing one nature and\n\t\t\t\t\tdiet, by their consent and agreement engender the\n\t\t\t\t\tbest and most pleasant temperament and bodily\n\t\t\t\t\tharmony-without which, they say, there is not any\n\t\t\t\t\tjoy or profit either  or\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tbut if overreaching and factious strife be engendered\n\t\t\t\t\tin them, they corrupt and destroy the animal most\n\t\t\t\t\tshamefully; so through the concord of brothers both\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tfamily and household are sound and flourish, and\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends and intimates, like an harmonious choir,\n\t\t\t\t\tneither do nor say, nor think, anything discordant;\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\ta slandering servant, or a flatterer who slips in from\n\t\t\t\t\toutside, or a malignant citizen.

So they report\n\t\t\t\t\tof Apollonis of Cyzicus, mother of King Eumenes\n\t\t\t\t\tand three other sons, Attalus and Philetaerus and\n\t\t\t\t\tAthenaeus, that she always congratulated herself\n\t\t\t\t\tand gave thanks to the gods, not because of wealth\n\t\t\t\t\tor empire, but because she saw her three sons members of the body-guard of the eldest, who passed\n\t\t\t\t\this days without fear surrounded by brothers with\n\t\t\t\t\tswords and spears in their hands. So again, on the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary, when Artaxerxes perceived that his son\n\t\t\t\t\tOchus had plotted against his brothers, he despaired\n\t\t\t\t\tand died.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tas Euripides says, and they are cruellest of all to\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthe parents themselves. For he that hates his own\n\t\t\t\t\tbrother and is angry with him cannot refrain from\n\t\t\t\t\tblaming the father that begat and the mother that\n\t\t\t\t\tbore such a brother."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "6", "p": [{"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf.

And it is also a cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tslander and accusations against such brothers ; for\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir fellow-citizens think that, after having been\n\t\t\t\t\tso closely bound together by their common education, their common life together, and their kinship,\n\t\t\t\t\tbrothers could not have become deadly enemies unless each were aware of many wicked deeds committed by the other. There must be, they infer,\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat reasons for the breaking-up of a great goodwill\n\t\t\t\t\tand affection. For this reason it is not easy to effect\n\t\t\t\t\ta reconciliation of brothers; for just as things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich have been joined together, even if the glue\n\t\t\t\t\tbecomes loose, may be fastened together again and\n\t\t\t\t\tbecome united, yet if a body which has grown\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether is broken or split, it is difficult to find\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans of welding or joining it; so friendships knitted\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether through long familiarity, even though the\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends part company, can be easily resumed again,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut when brothers have once broken the bonds\n\t\t\t\t\tof Nature, they cannot readily come together, and\n\t\t\t\t\teven if they do, their reconciliation bears with it a\n\t\t\t\t\tfilthy hidden sore of suspicion. Or rather, every enmity between man and man which steals into the\n\t\t\t\t\theart in company with the most painful emotions\n\t\t\t\t\t- contentiousness, anger, envy, remembrance of\n\t\t\t\t\twrongs - causes pain and perturbation of mind; but\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the enmity is toward a brother, with whom it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary to share sacrifices and the family's sacred\n\t\t\t\t\trites, to occupy the same sepulchre, and in life, perhaps, the same or a neighbouring habitation - such an\n\t\t\t\t\tenmity keeps the painful situation ever before our\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\teyes, and reminds us every day of the madness and\n\t\t\t\t\tfolly which has made the sweetest countenance of the\n\t\t\t\t\tnearest kinsman become most frowning and angry to\n\t\t\t\t\tlook upon, and that voice which has been beloved and\n\t\t\t\t\tfamiliar from boyhood most dreadful to hear. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthough they see many other examples of brothers\n\t\t\t\t\tusing the same house and table and undistributed\n\t\t\t\t\testates and slaves, yet they alone maintain different\n\t\t\t\t\tsets of friends and guests, considering as hostile\n\t\t\t\t\teverything dear to their brothers - and that too\n\t\t\t\t\tthough all the world may readily reflect that while\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends and boon-companions may be  and relatives by marriage and familiars\n\t\t\t\t\tmay be \n                when the old ones, like arms or\n\t\t\t\t\timplements, have been lost, yet the acquisition of another brother is impossible, as is that of a new hand\n\t\t\t\t\twhen one has been removed or that of a new eye\n\t\t\t\t\twhen one has been knocked out; rightly, then, did\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Persian woman declare, when she chose to save\n\t\t\t\t\ther brother in place of her children, that she could\n\t\t\t\t\tget other children, but not another brother, since\n\t\t\t\t\ther parents were dead."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "8", "p": {"q": [{"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "What then,"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "must one\n\t\t\t\t\twho has a bad brother do?"}, {"@direct": "unspecified"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "hatred of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevil"}], "note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, "#text": "Hierocles in Stobaeus, vol. iv. p. 661 ed.

It is in this way that many\n\t\t\t\t\tplay the demagogue against their brothers, having a\n\t\t\t\t\tspecious but unjust pretext for this rapacity; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthey deprive them of the greatest and fairest of inheritances, their parents' goodwill, by servilely and\n\t\t\t\t\tunscrupulously cutting across their brothers' path,\n\t\t\t\t\topportunely making their attacks when the parents\n\t\t\t\t\tare occupied and unsuspecting, and, in particular,\n\t\t\t\t\tshowing themselves dutiful and obedient and prudent\n\t\t\t\t\tin those matters in which they perceive their brothers\n\t\t\t\t\tto be in error, or seeming to be so. But the right\n\t\t\t\t\tway, on the contrary, when a son sees that his father\n\t\t\t\t\tis angry with his brother, is to take his share of it and\n\t\t\t\t\tbear the brunt of it together with his brother, by such\n\t\t\t\t\tassistance making the anger lighter, and then by\n\t\t\t\t\trendering services and favours to help somehow or\n\t\t\t\t\tother to restore his brother to his father's grace.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf there is error of omission, he can allege in the\n\t\t\t\t\tbrother's favour the absence of opportunity, or that\n\t\t\t\t\the was engaged on some other work, or his very\n\t\t\t\t\tnature, as being more useful and more intelligent\n\t\t\t\t\tin other directions. The saying of Agamemnon\n\t\t\t\t\talso is admirable :\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tand to me he has committed this duty. And\n\t\t\t\t\tfathers are very willing to accept even the substitution of other terms and to believe their sons when\n\t\t\t\t\tthey call their brothers' carelessness \n\t\t\t\t\ttheir stupidity  and their\n\t\t\t\t\tcontentiousness ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthe result is that he who aets as mediator succeeds\n\t\t\t\t\tin lessening the anger against his brother, and at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same time he increases his father's goodwill\n\t\t\t\t\ttoward himself."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "10", "p": {"note": {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Antigone"}, "#text": ", 742."}, "quote": {"@rend": "blockquote", "l": ["Most shameless son, who with his father dare", "To litigate,"]}, "q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "litigation"}, "#text": "Only after the erring brother has been defended\n\t\t\t\t\tin this manner should the other turn to him and rebuke him somewhat sharply, pointing out with all\n\t\t\t\t\tfrankness his errors of commission and of omission.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor one should neither give free rein to brothers,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor, again, should one trample on them when they\n\t\t\t\t\tare at fault (for the latter is the act of one who\n\t\t\t\t\tgloats over the sinner, the former that of one who\n\t\t\t\t\taids and abets him), but should apply his admonition as one who cares for his brother and grieves\n\t\t\t\t\twith him.

For, generally speaking, elder brothers,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they claim the right always to dominate and\n\t\t\t\t\tto have precedence over the younger and to have the\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantage in every matter where reputation and influence are involved, are oppressive and disagreeable;\n\t\t\t\t\tand younger brothers, in turn, being restive under the\n\t\t\t\t\tcurb and becoming fractious, make it their practice\n\t\t\t\t\tto despise and belittle the elder. The result is that\n\t\t\t\t\twhile the younger, feeling that they are being treated\n\t\t\t\t\tdespitefully and are discriminated against, resent and\n\t\t\t\t\ttry to avoid their elders' admonitions, the elder, ever\n\t\t\t\t\tclinging fast to their superiority, fear their brothers'\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\taugmentation as though it meant elimination for\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves. Just as, then, we think it right that\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who receive a favour should look upon it as of\n\t\t\t\t\tgreater, and those who bestow it as of lesser value,\n\t\t\t\t\tso, in regard to a difference in ages, if we advise the\n\t\t\t\t\telder to regard it as no great matter and the younger\n\t\t\t\t\tto think it no slight thing, we should rid the one\n\t\t\t\t\tof arrogance and neglect, and the other of disdain\n\t\t\t\t\tand contempt. And since it is fitting that the older\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be solicitous about the younger and should\n\t\t\t\t\tlead and admonish him, and that the younger should\n\t\t\t\t\thonour and emulate and follow the older, let the\n\t\t\t\t\tsolicitude of the former be rather that of a comrade than of a father, and of one who would persuade rather than command, and would rejoice in\n\t\t\t\t\ta brother's successes and applaud them rather than\n\t\t\t\t\tcriticize him if he errs and restrain him-a spirit\n\t\t\t\t\tshowing not only a greater desire to help, but also\n\t\t\t\t\tmore kindness of heart. And in the emulation of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe younger let imitation, not rivalry, be present;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor imitation is the act of one who admires, but\n\t\t\t\t\trivalry of one who envies. It is for this reason that\n\t\t\t\t\tmen love those who wish to become like themselves,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut repress and crush those who wish to become their\n\t\t\t\t\tequals. And among the many honours which it is\n\t\t\t\t\tfitting that the young render to their elders, obedience\n\t\t\t\t\tis most highly esteemed, and, together with respectfulness, brings about a staunch goodwill and favour\n\t\t\t\t\twhich will in turn lead to concessions. Thus it was\n\t\t\t\t\twith Cato: he so won over his elder brother Caepio by\n\t\t\t\t\tobedience and gentleness and silence from his earliest\n\t\t\t\t\tchildhood that finally, by the time they both were\n\t\t\t\t\tmen, he had so subdued him and filled him with so\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat a respect for himself that Caepio would neither\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tdo nor say anything without Cato's knowledge. For\n\t\t\t\t\texample, it is said that on one occasion, when Caepio\n\t\t\t\t\thad affixed his seal to a deposition and Cato carne up\n\t\t\t\t\tlater and was unwilling to add his own seal, Caepio\n\t\t\t\t\tdemanded that the document be returned and removed his seal before asking the reason why his\n\t\t\t\t\tbrother had suspected the deposition instead of\n\t\t\t\t\tbelieving it to be true. In the case of Epicurus also\n\t\t\t\t\this brothers' respect for him was clearly great because\n\t\t\t\t\tof the goodwill and solicitude he had for them,\n\t\t\t\t\tinspired as they were with admiration both for his\n\t\t\t\t\tother attainments and especially for his philosophy.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor even if they were mistaken in their opinion, yet\n\t\t\t\t\tsince they were convinced and constantly declared\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom their earliest childhood that there was no one\n\t\t\t\t\twiser than Epicurus, we may well admire both the\n\t\t\t\t\tman who inspired this devotion and also those who\n\t\t\t\t\tfelt it. However, of the more recent philosophers,\n\t\t\t\t\tApollonius the Peripatetic, by making Sotion, his\n\t\t\t\t\tyounger brother, more famous than himself, refuted\n\t\t\t\t\tthe man who asserted that fame could not be\n\t\t\t\t\tshared with another. And for myself, though I have\n\t\t\t\t\treceived from Fortune many favours which call for\n\t\t\t\t\tgratitude, that my brother Timon's affection for me\n\t\t\t\t\thas always transcended and still transcends all the\n\t\t\t\t\trest, no one is unaware who has ever had any dealings\n\t\t\t\t\twhatever with me, and least of all you, my familiar\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "17", "p": [{"pb": {"@id": "v.6.p.301"}, "note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf.

But when\n\t\t\t\t\this brother came, putting aside the diadem and pressing down the crest of his tiara, which reigning kings\n\t\t\t\t\twear erect, he went to meet Ariamenes and embraced him, and, sending gifts, he bade the bearers\n\t\t\t\t\tsay,  And Ariamenes said,\n\t\t\t\t\t And when the\n\t\t\t\t\tday of judgement came, the Persians appointed as\n\t\t\t\t\tjudge Artabanus, the brother of Darius ; but Xerxes\n\t\t\t\t\tsought to evade their decision that the judgement\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be made by Artabanus, since he put his faith in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people. But Atossa, his mother, chided him :\n\t\t\t\t\t Xerxes was therefore persuaded and\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the pleas were made, Artabanus declared that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe kingdom belonged by right to Xerxes ; and\n\t\t\t\t\tAriamenes at once leapt up and did obeisance to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tbrother and taking him by the hand set him upon the\n\t\t\t\t\tkingly throne.
