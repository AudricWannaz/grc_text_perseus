But some say that he moved because\n\t\t\t\t\the was banished from Syracuse when Gelo was\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrant. Lysias was born at Athens in the archonship\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Philocles who succeeded Phrasicles, in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsecond year of the eightieth Olympiad, and at first he\n\t\t\t\t\twas a schoolmate of the most prominent Athenians ;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut when the city sent the colony to Sybaris, which\n\t\t\t\t\twas afterwards renamed Thurii, he went out with his\n\t\t\t\t\teldest brother Polemarchus (for he had two others,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEuthydemus and Brachyllus), their father being\n\t\t\t\t\talready dead, to share in the allotment of land.

Isocrates was born in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe eighty-sixth Olympiad, in the archonship of\n\t\t\t\t\tLysimachus of Myrrhinus, being twenty-two years\n\t\t\t\t\tyounger than Lysias and seven years older than\n\t\t\t\t\tPlato.

And it is said that certain rhetorical teachings of Theramenes - those which go under the name\n\t\t\t\t\tof Boton - were of use to Isocrates when he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tfalsely accused in the courts.

It is evident that he composed speeches\n\t\t\t\t\tfor others, but he delivered only one, that on the\n\t\t\t\t\tExchange of Property. He set up a school and turned\n\t\t\t\t\tto philosophy and to writing out the results of his\n\t\t\t\t\tthinking, and he composed his Festival Oration and\n\t\t\t\t\tsome others of an advisory nature, some of which he\n\t\t\t\t\tdelivered himself and some of which he prepared for\n\t\t\t\t\tothers to deliver, hoping that in this way he might\n\t\t\t\t\tlead the Greeks to think as they ought. But when\n\t\t\t\t\the failed of his purpose he gave up that sort of thing\n\t\t\t\t\tand became the head of a school, at first, as some say,\n\t\t\t\t\tat Chios, where he had nine pupils.

A year (or, as some\n\t\t\t\t\tsay, four years) before his end he wrote the Panathenaic Oration; and for the composition of the\n\t\t\t\t\tFestival Oration he took ten (but some say fifteen)\n\t\t\t\t\tyears. This, they say, he derived from the speeches\n\t\t\t\t\tof Gorgias of Leontini and Lysias.

On account\n\t\t\t\t\tof his wealth he was envied and was proposed three\n\t\t\t\t\ttimes as trierarch. Twice he alleged illness and was\n\t\t\t\t\texempted by petitions presented by his son, but the\n\t\t\t\t\tthird time he undertook the duty and spent no small\n\t\t\t\t\tsum.

He never demanded a fee from a\n\t\t\t\t\tfellow-citizen. When his pupils went to meetings of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe assembly, he told them to report to him what was\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid there. He was greatly grieved by the death of\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates, and the next day he appeared in black\n\t\t\t\t\tclothing. And again, when someone asked him\n\t\t\t\t\t he said,  And\n\t\t\t\t\tonce when he was a guest at a banquet in the house\n\t\t\t\t\tof Nicocreon, despot of Cyprus, and some of those\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent urged him to discourse, he said, \n                When he saw the tragic poet Sophocles\n\t\t\t\t\tamorously following a boy, he said, \n                And when Ephorus of Cumae had\n\t\t\t\t\tleft his school without learning anything and had been\n\t\t\t\t\tsent back by his father with a second tuition-fee, he\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled him in fun Diphorus (Twice-bringer) ; he took,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, great pains with him and even suggested to\n\t\t\t\t\thim the subject of his work. He showred himself\n\t\t\t\t\talso prone to sexual indulgence ; he used an additional mattress beside him on his bed and kept his\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tpillow wet with saffron. And when he was young he\n\t\t\t\t\tdid not marry, but in his old age he kept a mistress\n\t\t\t\t\tnamed Lagisc, by whom he had a daughter who died\n\t\t\t\t\tunmarried at twelve years of age. Then he married\n\t\t\t\t\tthe daughter of the orator Hippias, Plathan, who\n\t\t\t\t\thad three sons, one of whom, Aphareus, as has been\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid above, he adopted. This Aphareus dedicated a\n\t\t\t\t\tbronze statue of him near the Olympieium on a\n\t\t\t\t\tcolumn with the inscription :\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd it is said that he rode a horse in a race when he\n\t\t\t\t\twas still a boy ; for a bronze figure of him as a boy\n\t\t\t\t\triding a horse is set up on the Acropolis in the ballground of the Arrhephoroi, as some have said. In all\n\t\t\t\t\this life but two lawsuits were brought against him :\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst when Megacleides challenged him to an exchange\n\t\t\t\t\tof property. He did not appear in court in this suit,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause he was ill, but sent his son Aphareus and won\n\t\t\t\t\this case. The second suit was when Lysimachus\n\t\t\t\t\tchallenged him to exchange property in connexion\n\t\t\t\t\twith the trierarchy ; and this case he lost and performed the trierarchy. There was also a painted\n\t\t\t\t\tportrait of him in the Pompeium. Aphareus wrote\n\t\t\t\t\tspeeches, both juridical and deliberative, but not\n\t\t\t\t\tmany. He also composed about thirty-seven tragedies, but the authorship of tw o of them is contested.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBeginning in the archonship of Lysistratus he presented in the twenty-eight years to the archonship of\n\t\t\t\t\tSosigenes six series of dramas at the City Dionysia\n\t\t\t\t\tand won the prize twice, Dionysius as his manager,\n\t\t\t\t\tand, other poets managing, he presented two other\n\t\t\t\t\tseries at the Lenaean festival. There were statues\n\t\t\t\t\tof the mother of Isocrates and Theodorus and of her\n\t\t\t\t\tsister Anaco set up on the Acropolis ; of these the\n\t\t\t\t\tstatue of the mother is now placed, with a changed\n\t\t\t\t\tinscription, near that of Hygieia, but the statue of\n\t\t\t\t\tAnaco is gone.

When he was young\n\t\t\t\t\tand physically strong he worked hard in the gymnasia ; and afterwards, since he had a clear voice, he\n\t\t\t\t\tpractised tragedy; and according to Demosthenes\n\t\t\t\t\the was for a long time under-secretary and regularly\n\t\t\t\t\tplayed as a third-rate actor with Aristodemus at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDionysiac festivals, repeating the old tragedies in\n\t\t\t\t\this spare time. And while still a child he helped his\n\t\t\t\t\tfather to teach letters, and as a young man he served\n\t\t\t\t\tin the patrol of the frontiers. After studying with\n\t\t\t\t\tIsocrates and Plato, as some say, but with Leodamas\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to Caecilius, he was prominent in public\n\t\t\t\t\tlife in the party opposed to that of Demosthenes, and\n\t\t\t\t\twas sent on many embassies, among them the one\n\t\t\t\t\tto Philip concerning the peace. For this he was\n\t\t\t\t\taccused by Demosthenes of having destroyed the\n\t\t\t\t\tPhocian nation and moreover of having stirred up\n\t\t\t\t\twar between the Amphissians, who were building\n\t\t\t\t\tthe harbour when he was chosen as delegate to the\n\t\t\t\t\tAmphictyonic Council, and the Amphictyons ; as a\n\t\t\t\t\tresult of which the Amphictyons turned to Philip\n\t\t\t\t\tfor protection, and he, assisted by Aeschines, took\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters in hand and conquered Phocis. But through\n\t\t\t\t\tthe aid of Eubulus, son of Spintharus, of the deme of\n\t\t\t\t\tProbalinthus, who had influence with the people, he\n\t\t\t\t\twas acquitted by thirty votes ; but some say that\n\t\t\t\t\tthough the orators composed their speeches, yet\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthe suit never came to trial because the battle of\n\t\t\t\t\tChaeroneia intervened. At a later time, when Philip\n\t\t\t\t\twas dead and Alexander was crossing over to Asia, he\n\t\t\t\t\tbrought a suit against Ctesiphon for illegal conduct in\n\t\t\t\t\tproposing the honours for Demosthenes; and when he\n\t\t\t\t\tdid not receive one-fifth of the votes cast, he went into\n\t\t\t\t\texile at Rhodes, not being willing to pay a fine of a\n\t\t\t\t\tthousand drachmas for his defeat. But some say that\n\t\t\t\t\the was further punished by disfranchisement and did\n\t\t\t\t\tnot leave the city of his own accord, and that he went\n\t\t\t\t\tto Alexander at Ephesus. During the confusion following Alexander's death he sailed to Rhodes, set up a\n\t\t\t\t\tschool there, and taught. He read to the Rhodians\n\t\t\t\t\this oration against Ctesiphon as an exhibition of his\n\t\t\t\t\tpowers, and when they all wondered that after\n\t\t\t\t\tdelivering that speech he had lost his case,  he said,  And he\n\t\t\t\t\tleft a school behind him there, called the Rhodian\n\t\t\t\t\tschool.
