The point that best proves this, gentle\n\t\t\t\t\tOdysseus, is the fact that in beasts valour is naturally\n\t\t\t\t\tequal in both sexes and the female is in no way\n\t\t\t\t\tinferior to the male. She takes her part both in the\n\t\t\t\t\tstruggle for existence and in the defence of her brood.\n\t\t\t\t\tYou have heard, I suppose, of the sow of Crommyon\n\t\t\t\t\twhich, though a female beast, caused so much trouble\n\t\t\t\t\tto Theseus. That famous Sphinx would have got\n\t\t\t\t\tno good of her wisdom as she sat on the heights of\n\t\t\t\t\tMt. Phicium, weaving her riddles and puzzles, if she\n\t\t\t\t\thad not continued to surpass the Thebans greatly in\n\t\t\t\t\tpower and courage. Somewhere thereabouts lived\n\t\t\t\t\talso the Teumesian vixen, a \n               ;\n\t\t\t\t\tand not far away, they say, was the Pythoness who\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tfought with Apollo for the oracle at Delphi. Your\n\t\t\t\t\tking received Aethe from the Sicyonian as a\n\t\t\t\t\trecompense for excusing him from military service,\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking a very wise choice when he preferred a fine,\n\t\t\t\t\tspirited mare to a cowardly man. You yourself have\n\t\t\t\t\toften observed in panthers and lionesses that the\n\t\t\t\t\tfemale in no way yields to the male in spirit and\n\t\t\t\t\tvalour. Yet, while you are off at the wars, your wife\n\t\t\t\t\tsits at home by the fire and troubles herself not so\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch as a swallow to ward off those who come against\n\t\t\t\t\therself and her home - and this though she is a\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartan born and bred. So why should I go on to\n\t\t\t\t\tmention Carian or Maeonian women? Surely from\n\t\t\t\t\twhat has been said it is perfectly obvious that men\n\t\t\t\t\thave no natural claim to courage; if they did,\n\t\t\t\t\twomen would have just as great a portion of valour.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt follows that your practice of courage is brought\n\t\t\t\t\tabout by legal compulsion, which is neither voluntary\n\t\t\t\t\tnor intentional, but in subservience to custom and\n\t\t\t\t\tcensure and moulded by extraneous beliefs and arguments. When you face toils and dangers, you do so\n\t\t\t\t\tnot because you are courageous, but because you are\n\t\t\t\t\tmore afraid of some alternative. For just as that\n\t\t\t\t\tone of your companions who is the first to board ship\n\t\t\t\t\tstands up to the light oar, not because he thinks\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing of it, but because he fears and shuns the\n\t\t\t\t\theavier one; just so he who accepts the lash to\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tescape the sword, or meets a foe in battle rather than\n\t\t\t\t\tbe tortured or killed, does so not from courage to face\n\t\t\t\t\tthe one situation, but from fear of the other. So it is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear that all your courage is merely the cowardice\n\t\t\t\t\tof prudence and all your valour merely fear that has\n\t\t\t\t\tthe good sense to escape one course by taking\n\t\t\t\t\tanother. And, to sum up, if you think that you are\n\t\t\t\t\tbetter in courage than beasts, why do your poets call\n\t\t\t\t\tthe doughtiest fighters \n                and \n                and \n                though no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoet ever called a lion  or a boar\n\t\t\t\t\t? But, I imagine, just as when\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who are swift are called \n                and\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who are handsome are called \n                there\n\t\t\t\t\tis exaggeration in the imagery ; just so the poets\n\t\t\t\t\tbring in a higher ideal when they compare mighty\n\t\t\t\t\twarriors to something else. And the reason is that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe spirit of anger is, as it were, the tempering or\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cutting edge of courage. Now beasts use this\n\t\t\t\t\tundiluted in their contests, whereas you men have\n\t\t\t\t\tit mixed with calculation, as wine with water, so that\n\t\t\t\t\tit is displaced in the presence of danger and fails you\n\t\t\t\t\twhen you need it most. Some of you even declare\n\t\t\t\t\tthat anger should not enter at all into fighting, but\n\t\t\t\t\tbe dismissed in order to make use of sober calculation; their contention is correct so far as selfpreservation goes, but is disgracefully false as regards\n\t\t\t\t\tvalorous defence. For surely it is absurd for you to\n\t\t\t\t\tfind fault with Nature because she did not equip\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tyour bodies with natural stings, or place fighting\n\t\t\t\t\ttusks among your teeth, or give you nails like curved\n\t\t\t\t\tclaws, while you yourselves remove or curb the\n\t\t\t\t\temotional instrument that Nature has given."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "5", "p": [{"note": {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "infra"}, "#text": "Gryllus acknowledges the truth of this soft impeachment later on, 989 b, ."}, "#text": "Odysseus.

For the\n\t\t\t\t\ttongue is said to be, and is, a judge of what is sweet\n\t\t\t\t\tor bitter or sour, when liquid flavours combine and fuse\n\t\t\t\t\twith the organ of taste; but our sense of smell, even\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore we taste, is a judge that can much more\n\t\t\t\t\tcritically distinguish the quality of each article of\n\t\t\t\t\tfood than any royal taster in the world. It admits\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is proper, rejects what is alien, and will not let\n\t\t\t\t\tit touch or give pain to the taste, but informs on and\n\t\t\t\t\tdenounces what is bad before any harm is done. And\n\t\t\t\t\tin other respects smell is no nuisance to us, as it is to\n\t\t\t\t\tyou, forcing you to collect and mix together incense\n\t\t\t\t\tof one kind or another and cinnamon and nard\n\t\t\t\t\tand malobathrum and Arabian aromatic reeds,\n\t\t\t\t\twith the aid of a formidable dyer's or witch's art, of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sort to which you give the name of unguentation,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthus buying at a great price an effeminate, emasculating luxury which has absolutely no real use. Yet,\n\t\t\t\t\tthough such is its nature, it has depraved not only\n\t\t\t\t\tevery woman, but lately the greater part of men as\n\t\t\t\t\twell, so that they refuse to sleep even with their own\n\t\t\t\t\twives unless they come to bed reeking with myrrh\n\t\t\t\t\tand scented powders. But sows attract boars and\n\t\t\t\t\tnannies bucks and other female creatures their consorts by means of their own special odours ; scented,\n\t\t\t\t\tas they are, with pure dew and grassy meadows, they\n\t\t\t\t\tare attracted to the nuptial union by mutual affection. The females are not coy and do not cloak\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir desires with deceits or trickeries or denials ;\n\t\t\t\t\tnor do the males, driven on by the sting of mad lust,\n\t\t\t\t\tpurchase the act of procreation by money or toil or\n\t\t\t\t\tservitude. No ! Both parties celebrate at the\n\t\t\t\t\tproper time a love without deceit or hire, a love\n\t\t\t\t\twhich in the season of spring awakens, like the\n\t\t\t\t\tburgeoning of plants and trees, the desire of animals,\n\t\t\t\t\tand then immediately extinguishes it. Neither does\n\t\t\t\t\tthe female continue to receive the male after she has\n\t\t\t\t\tconceived, nor does the male attempt her. So slight\n\t\t\t\t\tand feeble is the regard we have for pleasure : our\n\t\t\t\t\twhole concern is with Nature. Whence it comes\n\t\t\t\t\tabout that to this very day the desires of beasts have\n\t\t\t\t\tencompassed no homosexual mating. But you have\n\t\t\t\t\ta fair amount of such trafficking among your high\n\t\t\t\t\tand mighty nobility, to say nothing of the baser\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tsort. Agamemnon came to Boeotia hunting for\n\t\t\t\t\tArgynnus, who tried to elude him, and slandering\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sea and winds . . . then he gave his noble self\n\t\t\t\t\ta noble bath in Lake Copas to drown his passion\n\t\t\t\t\tthere and get rid of his desire. Just so Heracles,\n\t\t\t\t\tpursuing a beardless lad, lagged behind the other\n\t\t\t\t\theroes and deserted the expedition. On the\n\t\t\t\t\tRotunda of Ptoian Apollo one of your men secretly\n\t\t\t\t\tinscribed FAIR IS ACHILLES - when Achilles already\n\t\t\t\t\thad a son. And I hear that the inscription is still in\n\t\t\t\t\tplace. But a cock that mounts another for the lack\n\t\t\t\t\tof a female is burned alive because some prophet or\n\t\t\t\t\tseer declares that such an event is an important and\n\t\t\t\t\tterrible omen. On this basis even men themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tacknowledge that beasts have a better claim to\n\t\t\t\t\ttemperance and the non-violation of nature in their\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasures. Not even Nature, with Law for her ally,\n\t\t\t\t\tcan keep within bounds the unchastened vice of\n\t\t\t\t\tyour hearts ; but as though swept by the current of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir lusts beyond the barrier at many points, men\n\t\t\t\t\tdo such deeds as wantonly outrage Nature, upset her\n\t\t\t\t\torder, and confuse her distinctions. For men have,\n\t\t\t\t\tin fact, attempted to consort with goats and sows\n\t\t\t\t\tand mares, and women have gone mad with lust for\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tmale beasts. From such unions your Minotaurs\n\t\t\t\t\tand Aegipans, and, I suppose, your Sphinxes and\n\t\t\t\t\tCentaurs have arisen. Yet it is through hunger\n\t\t\t\t\tthat dogs have occasionally eaten a man ; and birds\n\t\t\t\t\thave tasted of human flesh through necessity ; but\n\t\t\t\t\tno beast has ever attempted a human body for lustful\n\t\t\t\t\treasons.

I have\n\t\t\t\t\theard that in Egypt everyone is a physician ; and\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of beasts each one is not only his own\n\t\t\t\t\tspecialist in medicine, but also in the providing of\n\t\t\t\t\tfood, in warfare and hunting as well as in self-defence\n\t\t\t\t\tand music, in so far as any kind of animal has a\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural gift for it.

For if you speak the truth and say that Nature\n\t\t\t\t\tis their teacher, you are elevating the intelligence\n\t\t\t\t\tof animals to the most sovereign and wisest of first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples. If you do not think that it should be\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled either reason or intelligence, it is high time\n\t\t\t\t\tfor you to cast about for some fairer and even more\n\t\t\t\t\thonourable term to describe it, since certainly the\n\t\t\t\t\tfaculty that it brings to bear in action is better and\n\t\t\t\t\tmore remarkable. It is no uninstructed or untrained\n\t\t\t\t\tfaculty, but rather self-taught and self-sufficient - \n\t\t\t\t\tand not for lack of strength. It is just because of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe health and completeness of its native virtue that\n\t\t\t\t\tit is indifferent to the contributions to its intelligence\n\t\t\t\t\tsupplied by the lore of others.

I say nothing of puppies\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are trained as hunters, or colts schooled to keep\n\t\t\t\t\ttime in their gait, or crows that are taught to talk,\n\t\t\t\t\tor dogs, to jump through revolving hoops. In the\n\t\t\t\t\ttheatres horses and steers go through an exact routine\n\t\t\t\t\tin which they lie down or dance or hold a precarious\n\t\t\t\t\tpose or perform movements not at all easy even for\n\t\t\t\t\tmen; and they remember what they have been\n\t\t\t\t\ttaught, these exhibitions of docility which are not in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe least useful for anything else. If you are doubtful\n\t\t\t\t\tthat we can learn arts, then let me tell you that we\n\t\t\t\t\tcan even teach them.

There would, then, be no further point in prolonging the discussion; and no doubt by this time Odysseus has changed his mind about the desirability of any further metamorphosis of his interlocutor, since the last argument touches him nearly. Sisyphus was said by some to be his real father ( 301 d). Others, however, believe that some discussion of further virtues, such as natural piety, must have followed; and perhaps the account closed with a consideration of justice. But would Odysseus have been convinced ( 986 b)? Or is this as good a place as any to end?
