For nature, which, they rightly\n\t\t\t\t\tsay, does everything with some purpose and to some\n\t\t\t\t\tend, did not create the sentient creature merely to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe sentient when something happens to it. No, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are in the world many things friendly to it,\n\t\t\t\t\tmany also hostile ; and it could not survive for a\n\t\t\t\t\tmoment if it had not learned to give the one sort a\n\t\t\t\t\twide berth while freely mixing with the other. It\n\t\t\t\t\tis, to be sure, sensation that enables each creature\n\t\t\t\t\tto recognize both kinds ; but the acts of seizing or\n\t\t\t\t\tpursuing that ensue upon the perception of what is\n\t\t\t\t\tbeneficial, as well as the eluding or fleeing of what is\n\t\t\t\t\tdestructive or painful, could by no means occur in\n\t\t\t\t\tcreatures naturally incapable of some sort of reasoning and judging, remembering and attending. Those\n\t\t\t\t\tbeings, then, which you deprive of all expectation,\n\t\t\t\t\tmemory, design, or preparation, and of all hopes,\n\t\t\t\t\tfears, desires, or griefs - they will have no use for eyes\n\t\t\t\t\tor ears either, even though they have them.

Now mules\n\t\t\t\t\tare not deficient in organs ; they have, in fact,\n\t\t\t\t\tgenitals and wombs and are able to use them with\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure, yet cannot attain the end of generation.\n\t\t\t\t\tConsider another approach : is it not ridiculous to\n\t\t\t\t\tkeep affirming that men like Socrates and Plato are\n\t\t\t\t\tinvolved in vice no less vicious than that of any slave\n\t\t\t\t\tyou please, that they are just as foolish and intemperate and unjust, and at the same time to stigmatize\n\t\t\t\t\tthe alloyed and imprecise virtue of animals as absence\n\t\t\t\t\tof reason rather than as its imperfection or weakness ?\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd this, though they acknowledge that vice is\n\t\t\t\t\ta fault of reason and that all animals are infected\n\t\t\t\t\twith vice : many, in fact, we observe to be guilty of\n\t\t\t\t\tcowardice and intemperance, injustice and malice.\n\t\t\t\t\tHe, then, who holds that what is not fitted by nature to receive the perfection of reason does not even\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\treceive any reason at all is, in the first place, no\n\t\t\t\t\tbetter than one who asserts that apes are not naturally ugly or tortoises naturally slow for the reason\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they are not capable of possessing beauty or\n\t\t\t\t\tspeed. In the second place, he fails to observe the\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinction which is right before his eyes : mere\n\t\t\t\t\treason is implanted by nature, but real and perfect\n\t\t\t\t\treason is the product of care and education. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is why every living creature has the faculty of\n\t\t\t\t\treasoning ; but if what they seek is true reason and\n\t\t\t\t\twisdom, not even man may be said to possess it.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor as one capacity for seeing or flying differs from\n\t\t\t\t\tanother (hawks and cicadas do not see alike, nor do\n\t\t\t\t\teagles and partridges fly alike), so also not every\n\t\t\t\t\treasoning creature has in the same way a mental\n\t\t\t\t\tdexterity or acumen that has attained perfection.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor just as there are many examples in animals of\n\t\t\t\t\tsocial instincts and bravery and ingenuity in ways\n\t\t\t\t\tand means and in domestic arrangements, so, on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other hand, there are many examples of the opposite : injustice, cowardliness, stupidity. And the very\n\t\t\t\t\tfactor which brought about our young men's contest\n\t\t\t\t\tto-day provides confirmation. It is on an assumption\n\t\t\t\t\tof difference that the two sides assert, one that land\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals, the other that sea animals, are naturally\n\t\t\t\t\tmore advanced toward virtue. This is clear also if\n\t\t\t\t\tyou contrast hippopotamuses with storks: the\n\t\t\t\t\tlatter support their fathers, while the former kill\n\t\t\t\t\tthem in order to consort with their mothers. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tsame is true if you compare doves with partridges;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the partridge cock steals the eggs and destroys\n\t\t\t\t\tthem since the female will not consort with him\n\t\t\t\t\twhile she is sitting, whereas male doves assume a\n\t\t\t\t\tpart in the care of the nest, taking turns at keeping\n\t\t\t\t\tthe eggs warm and being themselves the first to feed\n\t\t\t\t\tthe fledglings ; and if the female happens to be away\n\t\t\t\t\tfor too long a time, the male strikes her with his\n\t\t\t\t\tbeak and drives her back to her eggs or squabs. And\n\t\t\t\t\twhile Antipater was reproaching asses and sheep\n\t\t\t\t\tfor their neglect of cleanliness, I don't know how he\n\t\t\t\t\thappened to overlook lynxes and swallows; for\n\t\t\t\t\tlynxes dispose of their excrement by concealing and\n\t\t\t\t\tdoing away with it, while swallows teach their nestlings to turn tail and void themselves outward."}, {"pb": {"@id": "v.12.p.343"}, "#text": "Why, moreover, do we not say that one tree is less\n\t\t\t\t\tintelligent than another, as a sheep is by comparison with a dog ; or one vegetable more cowardly than\n\t\t\t\t\tanother, as a stag is by comparison with a lion ?

Now the story-books tell us that when\n\t\t\t\t\tDeucalion released a dove from the ark, as long as\n\t\t\t\t\tshe returned, it was a certain sign that the storm was\n\t\t\t\t\tstill raging ; but as soon as she flew away, it was a\n\t\t\t\t\tharbinger of fair weather. So even to this day the\n\t\t\t\t\tThracians, whenever they propose crossing a frozen\n\t\t\t\t\triver, make use of a fox as an indicator of the solidity\n\t\t\t\t\tof the ice. The fox moves ahead slowly and lays\n\t\t\t\t\ther ear to the ice ; if she perceives by the sound that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe stream is running close underneath, judging that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe frozen part has no great depth, but is only thin\n\t\t\t\t\tand insecure, she stands stock still and, if she is permitted, returns to the shore ; but if she is reassured\n\t\t\t\t\tby the absence of noise, she crosses over. And let\n\t\t\t\t\tus not declare that this is a nicety of perception unaided by reason ; it is, rather, a syllogistic conclusion\n\t\t\t\t\tdeveloped from the evidence of perception :  So logicians assert that a dog,\n\t\t\t\t\tat a point where many paths split off, makes use\n\t\t\t\t\tof a multiple disjunctive argument and reasons\n\t\t\t\t\twith himself:  Perception here affords nothing but the\n\t\t\t\t\tminor premiss, while the force of reason gives\n\t\t\t\t\tthe major premisses and adds the conclusion to the\n\t\t\t\t\tpremisses. A dog, however, does not need such a\n\t\t\t\t\ttestimonial, which is both false and fraudulent ; for\n\t\t\t\t\tit is perception itself, by means of track and spoor,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich indicates the way the creature fled ; it does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot bother with disjunctive and copulative propositions. The dog's true capacity may be discerned\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom many other acts and reactions and the performance of duties, which are neither to be smelled out\n\t\t\t\t\tnor seen by the eye, but can be carried out or perceived only by the use of intelligence and reason.\n\t\t\t\t\tI should only make myself ridiculous if I described\n\t\t\t\t\tthe dog's self-control and obedience and sagacity on\n\t\t\t\t\thunting parties to you who see and handle these\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters every day."}, {"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "De Natura Animal."}, "#text": "See Aelian,  vii. 10."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "loc. cit."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Nat.

First\n\t\t\t\t\tthe man threw stones at it, but could not drive it\n\t\t\t\t\taway.

A further proof\n\t\t\t\t\tthat supports him is the fact that birds which have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen taken young from the nest and bred apart from\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir mothers sing the worse for it; for the birds\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are bred with their mothers are taught and\n\t\t\t\t\tlearn, not for pay or glory, but for the joy of rivalling\n\t\t\t\t\teach other in song and because they cherish the\n\t\t\t\t\tbeautiful in their utterance rather than the useful."}, {"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Graecostadium"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "A Topographical Dictionary of Rome, s.v."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Forum Graecorum"}], "#text": "(see Platner and Ashby, ) or ."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "De Abstinentia"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Historia Animal."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Nat.

A certain barber at Rome had\n\t\t\t\t\this shop directly opposite the precinct which they\n\t\t\t\t\tcall the Market of the Greeks. He bred up a\n\t\t\t\t\twonderful prodigy of a jay with a huge range of\n\t\t\t\t\ttones and expressions, which could reproduce the\n\t\t\t\t\tphrases of human speech and the cries of beasts and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sound of instruments - under no compulsion, but\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking it a rule and a point of honour to let nothing\n\t\t\t\t\tgo unrepeated or unimitated. Now it happened that\n\t\t\t\t\ta certain rich man was buried from that quarter to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe blast of many trumpets and, as is customary,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere was a halt in front of the barber-shop while\n\t\t\t\t\tthe trumpeters, who were applauded and encored,\n\t\t\t\t\tplayed for a long time. From that day on the jay\n\t\t\t\t\twas speechless and mute, not letting out even a\n\t\t\t\t\tpeep to request the necessities of life ; so those\n\t\t\t\t\twho habitually passed the place and had formerly\n\t\t\t\t\twondered at her voice, were now even more astonished at her silence. Some suspected that she\n\t\t\t\t\thad been poisoned by rival bird-trainers, but most\n\t\t\t\t\tconjectured that the trumpets had blasted her hearing and that her voice had been simultaneously\n\t\t\t\t\textinguished. Now neither of these guesses was\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrect: it was self-discipline, it would seem, and her\n\t\t\t\t\ttalent for mimicry that had sought an inner retreat\n\t\t\t\t\tas she refitted and prepared her voice like a musical\n\t\t\t\t\tinstrument. For suddenly her mimicry returned\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tand there blazed forth none of those old familiar\n\t\t\t\t\timitations, but only the music of the trumpets,\n\t\t\t\t\treproduced with its exact sequences and every\n\t\t\t\t\tchange of pitch and rhythm and tone.

Yet there\n\t\t\t\t\tis nothing to impede illustrations drawn from land\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals : the land is wide open for investigation by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe senses. The sea, on the other hand, grants us\n\t\t\t\t\tbut a few dubious glimpses. She draws a veil over\n\t\t\t\t\tthe birth and growth, the attacks and reciprocal\n\t\t\t\t\tdefences, of most of her denizens. Among these\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are no few feats of intelligence and memory\n\t\t\t\t\tand community spirit that remain unknown to us\n\t\t\t\t\tand so obstruct our argument. Then too, land\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals by reason of their close relationship and\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir cohabitation have to some extent been imbued\n\t\t\t\t\twith human manners ; they have the advantage of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir breeding and teaching and imitation, which\n\t\t\t\t\tsweetens all their bitterness and sullenness, like\n\t\t\t\t\tfresh water mixed with brine, while their lack of\n\t\t\t\t\tunderstanding and dullness are roused to life by\n\t\t\t\t\thuman contacts. Whereas the life of sea creatures,\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing set apart by mighty bounds from intercourse\n\t\t\t\t\twith men and having nothing adventitious or acquired from human usage, is peculiar to itself, indigenous, and uncontaminated by foreign ways, not\n\t\t\t\t\tby distinction of Nature, but of location.
