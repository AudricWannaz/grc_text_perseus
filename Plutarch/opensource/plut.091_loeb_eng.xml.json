In the second place, that\n\t\t\t\t\tera produced personal temperaments and natures\n\t\t\t\t\twhich had an easy fluency and a bent towards composing poetry, and to them were given also zest and\n\t\t\t\t\teagerness and readiness of mind abundantly, thus\n\t\t\t\t\tcreating an alertness which needed but a slight\n\t\t\t\t\tinitial stimulus from without and a prompting of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\timagination, with the result that not only were\n\t\t\t\t\tastronomers and philosophers, as Philinus says,\n\t\t\t\t\tattracted at once to their special subjects, but when\n\t\t\t\t\tmen carne under the influence of abundant wine or\n\t\t\t\t\temotion, as some note of sadness crept in or some joy\n\t\t\t\t\tbefell, a poet would slip into tuneful utterance;\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir convivial gatherings were filled with amatory\n\t\t\t\t\tverses and their books with such writings.

Or\n\t\t\t\t\tshall we say, my friend, that nobody is in love nowadays, but that love has vanished from the earth\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause nobody in verse or song\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tas Pindar has put it ? No, that is absurd. The fact\n\t\t\t\t\tis that loves many in number still go to and fro among\n\t\t\t\t\tmen, but, being in association with souls that have no\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural talent nor ear for music, they forgo the flute\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tand lyre, but they are no less loquacious and ardent\n\t\t\t\t\tthan those of olden time. Besides it is not righteous\n\t\t\t\t\tnor honourable to say that the Academy and Socrates\n\t\t\t\t\tand Plato's congregation were loveless, for we may\n\t\t\t\t\tread their amatory discourses; but they have left\n\t\t\t\t\tus no poems.

But, as life took on a change along with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe change in men's fortunes and their natures,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen usa ge banished the unusual and did away\n\t\t\t\t\twith the golden topknots and dressing in soft robes,\n\t\t\t\t\tand, on occasion, cut off the stately long hair and\n\t\t\t\t\tcaused the buskin to be no longer worn, men accustomed themselves (nor was it a bad thing) to oppose\n\t\t\t\t\texpensive outlay by adorning themselves with\n\t\t\t\t\teconomy, and to rate as decorative the plain and\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tsimple rather than the ornate and elaborate.

There is, in fact, profound peace and tranquillity ; war has ceased, there are no wanderings of\n\t\t\t\t\tpeoples, no civil strifes, no despotisms, nor other\n\t\t\t\t\tmaladies and ills in Greece requiring many unusual\n\t\t\t\t\tremedial forces. Where there is nothing complicated\n\t\t\t\t\tor secret or terrible, but the interrogations are on\n\t\t\t\t\tslight and commonplace matters, like the hypothetical\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions in school: if one ought to marry, or to start\n\t\t\t\t\ton a voyage, or to make a loan ; and the most important\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tconsultations on the part of States concern the\n\t\t\t\t\tyield from crops, the increase of herds, and public\n\t\t\t\t\thealth \u2014 to clothe such things in verse, to devise\n\t\t\t\t\tcircumlocutions, and to foist strange words upon\n\t\t\t\t\tinquiries that call for a simple short answer is the\n\t\t\t\t\tthing done by an ambitious pedant embellishing an\n\t\t\t\t\toracle to enhance his repute. But the prophetic\n\t\t\t\t\tpriestess has herself also nobility of character, and\n\t\t\t\t\twhenever she descends into that place and finds\n\t\t\t\t\therself in the presence of the god, she cares more for\n\t\t\t\t\tfulfilling her function than for that kind of repute or\n\t\t\t\t\tfor men's praise or blame."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "29", "p": [{"quote": {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Od."}, "#text": "Adapted from Homer,  ii. 190."}, "#text": "Since for himself first of all it will prove to be more \n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistressing,"}, "note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf.
