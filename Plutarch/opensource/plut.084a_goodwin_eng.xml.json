For the wine is above\n\t\t\t\t\tthe heads of those that are drunk, and they are depraved\n\t\t\t\t\tand debased thereby; whereas it is requisite that they\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be above pleasure and conquer it, but not be subdued by it. As for the ivy,it being unfruitful and useless to men, as also infirm, and by reason of its infirmity\n\t\t\t\t\tstanding in need of other trees to climb upon, though by\n\t\t\t\t\tits shadow and sight of its greenness it doth bewitch the\n\t\t\t\t\tvulgar,what if they judge it not convenient to nourish\n\t\t\t\t\tit about a house because it bringeth no profit, or to suffer it to clasp about any thing, seeing it is so hurtful to\n\t\t\t\t\tplants that bear it up, while it sticketh fast in the ground?\n\t\t\t\t\tHence ivy is forbidden at the Olympic festivals, and neither\n\t\t\t\t\tat Athens in Juno's sacrifices, nor at Thebes in those belonging to Venus, can any wild ivy be seen; though in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Agrionia and Nyctelia (which are services to Bacchus\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the most part performed in the dark) it is to be found.\n\t\t\t\t\tOr was this a symbol of the prohibition of revels and sports\n\t\t\t\t\tof Bacchus? For women that were addicted to Bacchanal\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tsports presently ran to the ivy and plucked it off, tearing\n\t\t\t\t\tit in pieces with their hands and gnawing it with their\n\t\t\t\t\tmouths, so that they are not altogether to be disbelieved\n\t\t\t\t\tthat say it hath a spirit in it that stirreth and moveth to\n\t\t\t\t\tmadness, transporting and bereaving of the senses, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat alone by itself it introduceth drunkenness without\n\t\t\t\t\twine to those that have an easy inclination to enthusiasm."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "113", "p": [{"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Question"}, "#text": "113.
