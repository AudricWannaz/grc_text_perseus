For example, in the Spartan Sayings, under the name of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAgesilaus are found seventy-nine different sayings, but only twelve of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare selected for inclusion in the Sayings of Kings and Commanders, so that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Emperor Trajan (if the collection was made for him) should not. be\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverburdened in his reading !", {"pb": {"@id": "v.3.p.241"}, "#text": "The ms. tradition of these Spartan sayings is in sad confusion.

The explanation probably is that Plutarch copied these anecdotes as\n\t\t\t\t\t\the found them in the books from which he made his excerpts. Xenophon, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\texample, or Thucydides seldom uses Doric, but represents the Spartans as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeaking Attic, as frankly as Herodotus or Aeschylus represents the Persians\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas spealdng Greek. So on the stage in England or America, or in novels,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrench or German characters speak English, or vice versa-a convention which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis universally accepted.

Hence no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tradical changes have been made in the ms. tradition.
