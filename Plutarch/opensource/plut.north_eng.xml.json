have sprung many noble personages,\nwhereof Ancus Martius was one, King Numa's daughter's\nson, who was King of Rome after Tullus Hostilius. \n \nOf\nthe same house were Publius and Quintus, who brought to Rome\ntheir best water they had, by conduits. Censorinus also came\nof that family, that was so surnamed, because the people had\nchosen him Censor twice. \nThrough whose persuasion they made\na law, that no man from thenceforth might \n\n                   \nor enjoy\nthe Censorship twice. Caius Martius, whose life we intend now\nto write, being left an orphan by his father, was brought up\nunder his mother a widow; who taught us by experience, that\norphanage bringeth many \n\n                  \nto a child, but doth \n\nnot hinder him to become an honest man, and to excel in virtue\nabove the common sort: as they that are meanly born wrongfully\ndo complain, that it is the occasion of their casting away,\nfor that no man in their youth taketh any care of them to see\nthem well brought up, and taught that were \n\n                  . This man\nalso is a good proof to confirm some men's opinions: That a\nrare and excellent wit, untaught, cloth bring forth many good and\nevil things together: as a fat soil that lieth unmanured bringeth\nforth both herbs and weeds. For this Martius' natural\nwit and great heart did marvellously stir up his courage to do\nand attempt notable acts. But on the other side, for lack of\neducation, he was so choleric and impatient, that he would\nyield to no living creature: which made him churlish, uncivil,\nand altogether unfit for any man's \n\n                  . Yet men marvelling\nmuch at his constancy, that he was never overcome\nwith pleasure nor money, and how he would endure easily all\nmanner of pains and \n\n                  :\nthereupon they well liked and\ncommended his stoutness and \n\n                  \nBut for all that\nthey could not be acquainted with him, as one citizen useth to\nbe with another in the city: his behaviour was so unpleasant\nto them by reason of a certain insolent and stern manner he\nhad, which, because he was too lordly, was disliked. And to\nsay truly, the greatest benefit that learning bringeth unto men\nis this: that it teacheth men that be rude and rough of nature,\nby \n\n                  \nand rule of reason, to be civil and courteous, and\nto like better the mean state than the higher. Now in those\ndays, valiantness was honoured in Rome above all other virtues.\nwhich they call , by the name of virtue itself, as including\nin that general name all other special virtues besides. So\nthat  in the Latin was as much as valiantness.\nBut Martius\nbeing more inclined to the wars than any other gentleman\nof his time, began from his childhood to give himself to\nhandle weapons, and daily did exercise himself therein: and he\nesteemed outward armour to no purpose, unless one were\nnaturally armed within. Moreover he did so exercise his body\nto \n\n                  \nand all kind of activity, that he was very swift\nin running, strong in wrestling' and mighty in \n\n                  ,\nso that\nno man could ever \n\n                  \nhim. insomuch as those that would\ntry \n\n                  \nwith him for strength and nimbleness, would say\nwhen they were overcome: that all was by reason of his natural \n\n                  ,\nthat never yielded to any pain\nor toil he took upon him.\n\n\n                  \n                  \n                   The first time he went to the wars, being but a stripling,\nwas when Tarquin surnamed the proud (that had been king of\nRome, and was driven out for his pride, after many attempts\nmade by sundry battles to come in again, wherein he was ever\novercome) did come to Rome with all the aid of the Latins,\nand many other people of Italy: even as it were \n\n                  \nupon a battle by them, who with a great and mighty\narmy had undertaken to put him into his kingdom again, not\nso much to pleasure him, as to overthrow the power of the\nRomans, whose greatness they both feared and envied. In\nthis battle, wherein were many hot and sharp encounters of\neither \n\n                  ,\nMartius valiantly fought in the sight of the Dictator:\nand a Roman soldier being thrown to the ground even\nhard \n\n                  \nhim, Martius straight bestrid him, and slew the enemy,\nwith his own hands, that had before overthrown the Roman.\nHereupon, after the battle was won, the Dictator did not forget\nso noble an act, and therefore first of all he crowned Martius\nwith a garland of oaken boughs. For whosoever saveth the life\nof a Roman, it is a \n\n                  \namong them, to honour him with\nsuch a garland. This was, either because the law did this\nhonour to the oak, in favour of the Arcadians, who by the oracle\nof Apollo were in old time called eaters of acorns: or else because\nthe soldiers might easily in every place come \n\n                  \noaken\nboughs: or lastly, because they thought it very necessary, to\ngive him that had saved a citizen's life, a crown of this tree to\nhonour him, being properly dedicated unto Jupiter, the patron\nand protector of cities, and thought amongst other wild trees to\nbring forth a profitable fruit, and of plants to be the strongest.\nMoreover, men at the first beginning did use acorns for their\nbread, and honey for their drink: and further, the oak did feed\ntheir beasts, and give them birds, by taking glue from the oaks,\nwith the which they made bird-lime to catch silly birds. They\nsay that Castor and Pollux appeared in this battle, and that\n\n\n                  \nafter the battle, men saw them in the marketplace\nat Rome, all their horses being on a white foam: and\nthey were the first that brought news of the victory, even in the\nsame place where remaineth at this present a temple built in\nthe honour of them, near unto the fountain. And this is the\ncause why the day of this victory (which was the fifteenth of\nJuly) is consecrated yet to this day unto Castor and Pollux.\n\n\n                  \nMoreover it is daily seen, that honour and reputation lighting\non young men before their time, and before they have any great\ncourage by nature, the desire to win more dieth \n\n                  \nin\nthem, which easily happeneth, the same having no deep root\nin them before. Where contrariwise, the first honour that\nvaliant minds do come unto, cloth quicken up their appetite,\nhasting them forward as with force of wind, to \n\n                  \n\nthings of high-deserving praise. For they \n\n                  \nnot to receive\nreward for service done, but rather take it for a remembrance\nand encouragement, to make them do better in time to come:\nand be ashamed also to cast their honour. at their heels, not\nseeking to increase it still by like desert of worthy valiant\ndeeds. This desire being bred in Martius, he \n\n                  \nstill\nto \n\n                  \nhimself in manliness: and being desirous to shew a\ndaily increase of his valiantness, his noble service did still\nadvance his fame, bringing in spoils upon spoils from the enemies.\nWhereupon, the captains that came afterwards (for envy\nof them that went before) did contend who should most honour\nhim, and who should bear most honourable testimony of his\nvaliantness. Insomuch as the Romans having many wars and\nbattles in those days, Coriolanus was at them all: and there\nwas not a battle fought, from whence he returned not with\nsome reward of honour. And as for \n\n                  ,\nthe only \n\n                  \n\nthat made them valiant, was that they hoped to have honour:\nbut touching Martius, the only thing that made him to love\nhonour was the joy he saw his mother did take of him. For\nhe thought nothing made him so happy and honourable, as that\nhis mother might hear every body praise and commend him,\nthat she might always see him return with a crown upon his\nhead, and that she might \n\n                  \nembrace him with tears running\ndown her cheeks for joy: which desire they say Epaminondas\ndid avow and confess to have been in him, as to think himself\na most happy and blessed man, that his father and mother\nin their life time had seen the victory he \n\n                  \nin the plain of\nLeuctres. Now as for Epaminondas, he had this good hap, to\nhave his father and mother living, to be partakers of his joy\nand prosperity: but Martius thinking all due to his mother,\nthat had \n\n                  \nalso due to his father if he had lived, did not\nonly content himself to \n\n                  \nand honour her, but at her desire\ntook a wife also, by whom he had two children, and yet\nnever left his mother's house \n\n                  .\n\n\n\n                  \n                   Now he being grown to great credit and authority in\nRome for his valiantness, it fortuned there grew sedition in the\ncity, because the Senate did favour the rich against the people,\n\n\nwho did complain of the sore oppression of usurers, of whom\nthey borrowed money. For those that had little, were yet\nspoiled of that little they had by their creditors, for lack of\nability to pay the usury: who offered their goods to be sold\nto them that would give most. And such as had nothing left,\ntheir bodies were laid hold on, and they were made their bondmen,\nnotwithstanding all the wounds and cuts they shewed,\nwhich they had received in many battles, fighting for defence of\ntheir country and commonwealth: of the which, the last war\nthey made was against the Sabines, wherein they fought upon\nthe promise the rich men had made them, that from thenceforth\nthey would \n\n                  \nthem more gently, and also upon the word of\nMarcus Valerius chief of the Senate, who, by authority of the\ncouncil, and in the behalf of the rich, said they should perform\nthat they had promised. But after that they had faithfully served\nin this last battle of all, where they overcame their enemies,\nseeing they were never a whit the better, nor more gently intreated,\nand that the Senate would give no ear to them, but\nmade as though they had forgotten the former promise, and\nsuffered them to be made slaves and bondmen to their creditors,\nand besides, to be turned out of all that ever they had: they\nfell then even to flat rebellion and mutiny, and to stir up dangerous\ntumults within the city. The Romans' enemies hearing\nof this rebellion, did straight enter the territories of Rome with\na marvellous great \n\n                  ,\nspoiling and burning all as they\ncame. Whereupon the Senate immediately made open proclamation\nby sound of trumpet, that all those that were of lawful\nage to carry weapon, should come and enter their names into\nthe muster-master's book, to go to the wars: but no man obeyed\ntheir commandment. Whereupon their chief magistrates and\nmany of the Senate began to be of divers opinions among\nthemselves. For some thought it was \n\n                  ,\nthey should somewhat\nyield to the poor people's request, and that they should\na little qualify the severity of the law. Other held hard against\nthat opinion, and that was Martius for one. For he alleged,\nthat the creditors' losing their money they had lent was not the\nworst thing that was herein: but that the lenity that was favoured\nwas a beginning of disobedience, and that the proud attempt\nof the communally was, to abolish law, and to bring all to\nconfusion. Therefore he said, if the Senate were wise, they\nshould betimes \n\n                  \nand quench this ill-favoured and worse\nmeant beginning. \n\nThe Senate met many days in consultation\n\nabout it: but in the end they \n\n                  \nnothing. The poor\ncommon people, seeing no redress, gathered themselves one day\ntogether; and one encouraging another, they all forsook the city,\nand encamped themselves upon a hill, called at that day the\nHoly Hill, along the river of Tiber, offering no creature any hurt\nor violence, or making any shew of actual rebellion, saving that\nthey cried as they went up and down, that the rich men had\ndriven them out of the city, and that throughout all Italy they\nmight find air, water, and ground to bury \n\n                  \nin. Moreover,\nthey said, to dwell at Rome was nothing else but to be slain,\nor hurt with continual wars and fighting, for defence of the rich\nmen's goods.\n\n The Senate, being afraid of their departure, did send\nunto them certain of the pleasantest old men, and the most\nacceptable to the people among them. Of those Menenius\nAgrippa was he, who was sent for chief man of the message\nfrom the Senate. He, after many good persuasions and gentle\nrequests made to the people, on the behalf of the Senate, knit\nup his oration in the end with a notable tale, in this manner:\nThat \"on a time all the members of man's body did rebel against\nthe belly, complaining of it, that it \n\n                  \nremained in the midst\nof the body without doing any thing, neither did bear any\nlabour to the maintenance of the rest: whereas all other parts and\nmembers did labour \n\n                  ,\nand were very \n\n                  ,\nto satisfy\nthe appetites and desires of the body. And so the belly, all\nthis notwithstanding, laughed at their folly, and said: It is true,\nI first receive all meats that nourish man's body: but afterwards\nI send it again to the nourishment of other parts of the same.\nEven so (quoth he) O you, my masters, and citizens of Rome,\nthe reason is alike between the Senate and you. For matters\nbeing well digested, and their counsels \n\n                  \nexamined,\ntouching the benefit of the commonwealth, the Senators are\ncause of the common \n\n                  \nthat cometh unto every one of\nyou.\"\n\n\n                  These persuasions pacified the people conditionally, that\nthe Senate would grant there should be yearly chosen five Magistrates,\nwhich they now call Tribuni plebis, whose office should\nbe to defend the poor people from violence and oppression. So\nJunius Brutus and Sicinius Vellutus were the first tribunes of\nthe people that were chosen, who  \n\n                  \nthe causers and\n\n\n                  \nof this sedition. Hereupon, the city being grown again\nto good quiet and unity, the people immediately went to the\nwars, strewing that they had a good will to do better than ever\n\n\nthey did, and to be very willing to obey the Magistrates in that\nthey would command concerning the wars.\n\n Martius also, though it \n\n                  \nto see the\ngreatness of the people thus increased, considering it was to the\nprejudice and \n\n                  \nof the Nobility, and also saw that other\nnoble Patricians were troubled as well as himself: he did persuade\nthe Patricians, to shew themselves no less forward and\nwilling to fight for their country than the common people were:\nand to let them know by their deeds and acts, that they did not\nso much \n\n                  \nthe people in power and riches, as they did exceed\nthem in true nobility and valiantness. \n\n\n                  In the country of the\nVolsces, against whom the Romans made war at that time,\nthere was a principal city and of most fame, that was called\nCorioles, before the which the Consul Cominius did lay siege. \nWherefore all the other Volsces, fearing lest that city should be\ntaken by assault, they came from all parts of the country to\nsave it, intending to give the Romans battle before the city,\nand to give an onset on them in two \n\n                  \nplaces. The Consul\nCominius understanding this, divided his army also into\ntwo parts; and taking the one part with himself, he marched towards\nthem that were drawing to the city out of the country:\nand the other part of his army he left in the camp with Titus\n\n\n                  \n(one of the valiantest men the Romans had at that time)\nto resist those that would make any sally out of the city upon\nthem. So the Coriolanus, making small account of them that lay\nin camp before the city, made a sally out upon them, in the\nwhich at the first the Coriolans had the better, and \n\n                  \nthe\nRomans back again into the trenches of their camp. But Martius\nbeing there at that time, running out of the camp with a\nfew men with him, he slew the first enemies he met withal, and\nmade the rest of them \n\n                  \nupon the sudden, crying out to the\nRomans that had turned their backs, and calling them again to\nfight with a loud voice. For he was even such another, as Cato\nwould have a soldier and a captain to be, not only terrible and\nfierce to lay about him, but to make the enemy \n\n                  \nwith the\nsound of his voice, and grimness of his countenance. Then\nthere flocked about him immediately a great number of Romans:\nwhereat the enemies were so \n\n                  ,\nthat they \n\n\n                  .\nBut Martius, not staying so, did chase and follow\nthem to their own gates, that fled for life. And there perceiving\nthat the Romans retired back, for the great number of darts\nand arrows which flew about their ears from the walls of the\n\n\ncity, and that there was not one man amongst them that durst\nventure himself to follow the flying enemies into their city, for\nthat it was full of men of war very well armed and appointed,\nhe did encourage his fellows with words and deeds, crying out\nto them, \"that fortune had opened the gates of the city, more for\nthe followers than the fliers.\" But all this notwithstanding, few\nhad the hearts to follow him. Howbeit Martius, being in the\nthrong amongst the enemies, thrust himself into the gates of\nthe city, and entered the same among them that fled, without\nthat any one of them durst at the first turn their face upon him,\nor \n\n                  \nto \n\n                  \nhim. But he, looking about him, and seeing he\nwas entered the city with very few men to help him, and perceiving\nhe was environed by his enemies that gathered round\nabout to set upon him, did things, as it is written, wonderful\nand incredible, as well for the force of his hand, as also for the\nagility of his body; and with a wonderful courage and valiantness\nhe made a lane through the midst of them, and overthrew\nalso those he \n\n                  :\nthat some he made run to the furthest\npart of the city, and other for fear he made yield themselves,\nand to let fall their weapons before him. By this means Martius,\nthat was gotten out, had some leisure to bring the Romans\nwith more safety into the city. \n\n\n                  The city being taken in this\nsort, the most part of the soldiers began \n\n                  \nto spoil, to carry away, and to \n\n                  \nthe booty they had won. But\nMartius was marvellous angry with them, and cried out on\nthem, that it was no time now to look after spoil, and to run\nstraggling here and there to enrich themselves, whilst the other\nConsul and their fellow-citizens peradventure were fighting with\ntheir enemies: and how that, leaving the spoil, they should seek\nto wind themselves out of danger and peril. Howbeit, cry and\nsay to them what he could, very few of them would hearken to\nhim. Wherefore taking those that willingly offered themselves\nto follow him, he went out of the city, and took his way toward\nthat part where he understood the rest of the army was, exhorting\nand intreating them by the way that followed him, not\nto be fainthearted; and oft holding up his hands to heaven, he\nbesought the gods to be gracious and favourable unto him, that\nhe might come in time to the battle, and  \n\n                  \nto hazard his life in defence of his countrymen. Now the Romans\nwhen they were put in battle \n\n                  ,\nand ready to take their \n\n                  \n\non their arms, and to gird them upon their \n\n                  ,\n\nhad a custom to make their wills at that very instant, without\n\n\nany manner of writing, naming him only whom they would\nmake their heir in the presence of three or four witnesses.\nMartius came just to that reckoning, whilst the soldiers were\ndoing after that sort, and that the enemies were approached so\nnear, as one stood in view of the other. When they saw him at\nhis first coming all bloody, and in a sweat, and but with a few\nmen following him, some thereupon began to be \n\n                  .\nBut\nsoon after, when they saw him run with a lively cheer to the\nConsul, and to take him by the hand, declaring how he had\ntaken the city of Corioles, and that they saw the Consul Cominius\nalso kiss and \n\n                  \nhim, then there was not a man but\ntook heart again to him, and began to be of good courage; some\nhearing him report, from point to point, the happy success of\nthis exploit, and other also conjecturing it by seeing their gestures\nafar off. Then they all began to call upon the Consul to\nmarch forward, and to delay no longer, but to give charge upon\nthe enemy. Martius asked him how the order of their enemy's\nbattle was, and on which side they had placed their best fighting\nmen. The Consul made him answer, that he thought the\nbands which were in the \n\n                  \nof their battle were those of\nthe Antiates, whom they esteemed to be the \n\n                  \nmen, and\nwhich, for valiant courage, would \n\n                  \nto any of the\nhost of their enemies. Then prayed Martius to be set directly\nagainst them. The Consul granted him, greatly praising his\ncourage. Then Martius, when both armies came almost to join,\nadvanced himself a good space before his company, and went\nso fiercely to give charge on the \n\n                  \nthat came right\nagainst him, that they could stand no longer in his hands: he\nmade such a lane through them, and opened a passage into the\n\n\n                  \nof the enemies. But the two wings of either side turned\none to the other, to compass him in between them: which the\nConsul Cominius perceiving, he sent thither  \n\n                  \nthe best\nsoldiers he had about him. So the battle was marvellous bloody\nabout Martius, and in a very short space many were slain in the\nplace. But in the end the Romans were so strong, that they \ndistressed the enemies, and brake their array: and scattering \nthem, made them fly. Then they prayed Martius that he would\nretire to the camp, because they saw he was able to do no more,\nhe was already so wearied with the great \n\n                  \n\nand so faint with the great wounds he had upon him. But Martius\nanswered them, that it was not for conquerors to yield, nor\nto be fainthearted: and thereupon began afresh to chase those\n\n\nthat fled, until such time as the army of the enemies was utterly\noverthrown, and numbers of them slain and taken prisoners\n\n\n                  The next morning betimes, Martius went to the Consul,\nand the other Romans with him. There the Consul Cominius\ngoing up to his chair of state, in the presence of the whole army,\ngave thanks to the gods for so great, glorious, and prosperous a\nvictory: then he spake to Martius, whose valiantness he commended\nbeyond the moon, both for that he himself saw him do\nwith his eyes, as also for that Martius had reported unto him.\nSo in the end he \n\n                  \nwilled Martius, that he should choose out of\nall the horses they had taken of their enemies, and of all their\ngoods they had won (whereof there was great store) ten of every\nsort which he liked best, before any distribution should be made\nto other. Besides this great honourable offer he had made him,\nhe gave him, in \n\n                  \ntestimony that he had won that day the \n\n                  \nof\nprowess above all other, a goodly horse with a \n\n                  ,\nand\nall \n\n                  \nto him: which the whole army beholding, did marvellously\npraise and commend. But Martius, stepping forth, told\nthe Consul he most thankfully accepted the gift of his horse,\nand was a glad man besides, that his service had deserved his\ngeneral's commendation: and as for his other offer, which was\nrather a mercenary reward than a honourable recompence, he\nwould have none of it, but was contented to have his equal\npart with the other soldiers. \" Only, this \n\n                  \n(said he) I crave\nand beseech you to grant me. Among the Volsces there is an\nold friend and host of mine, an honest wealthy man, and now a\nprisoner; who, living before in great wealth in his own country,\nliveth now a poor prisoner, in the hands of his enemies: and\nyet notwithstanding all this his misery and misfortune, it would\ndo me great pleasure if I could save him from this one danger,\nto keep him from being sold as a slave.\" The soldiers hearing\nMartius' words, made a marvellous great shout among them,\nand there were more that wondered at his great \n\n                  \n\nand abstinence, when they saw so little covetousness in him,\nthan they were that highly praised and extolled his valiantness.\nFor even they themselves that did somewhat \n\n                  \nand envy his glory, to see him thus honoured and \n\n                  \npraised, did\nthink him so much the more worthy of an honourable recompence\nfor his valiant service, as the more carelessly he refused\nthe great offer made unto him for his profit; and they esteemed\nmore the virtue that was in him, that made him refuse such rewards,\nthan that which made them to be offered to him, as unto\n\na worthy person. For it is far more commendable, to use riches\nwell, than to be valiant: and yet it is better not to desire them\nthan to use them welt\n\n\n                   After this shout and noise of the assembly was somewhat\nappeased, the Consul Cominius began to speak in this\nsort: \"we cannot compel Martius to take these gifts we offer\nhim if he will not receive them, but we will give him such a\nreward for the noble service he hath done, as he cannot refuse.\nTherefore we do order and decree, that henceforth he be called\nCoriolanus, unless his valiant acts have won him that name before\nour nomination.\" And so ever since, he still \n\n                  \nthe third\nname of Coriolanus. And thereby it appeareth, that the first\nname the Romans have, as Caius, was as our Christian name\nnow. The second, as Martius, was the name of the house and\nfamily they came of. The third was some addition given, either\nfor some act or notable service, or for some mark on their face,\nor of some shape of their body, or else for some special virtue\nthey had. Even so did the Grecians in old time give \n\n                  \n\nto princes, by reason of some notable act \n\n                  \nmemory. As\nwhen they have called some Soter and Callinicos, as much to\nsay as saviour and conqueror. Or else of some notable apparent\nmark on one's face, or on his body, they have called him\nPhiscon and Grypos: as ye would say, gore\n                  ,\nand hooknosed;\nor else for some virtue, as Euergetes and Philadelphes,\nto wit, a benefactor, and lover of his brethren. Orotherwise for\none's great felicity, as Eudaemon: as much to say as fortunate.\nFor so was the second of the \n\n                  \nsurnamed. And some\nkings have had surnames of jest and mockery. As one of the\nAntigones that was called Doson, to say, the Giver: who was\never promising, and never giving. And one of the Ptolomees was\ncalled Lamyros: to say, \n\n                  .\nThe Romans \n\n                  ,\nmore\nthan any other nation, to give names of mockery in this sort.\nAs, there was one Metellus, surnamed Diadematus, the banded,\nbecause he carried a band about his head  \n\n                  ,\nby reason\nof a sore he had in his forehead. One other of his own\nfamily was called Celer, the quick-fly, because a few days after\nthe death of his father, he shewed the people the cruel fight of\nfencers at \n\n                  \nswords, which they found wonderful for the\nshortness of time. Other had their surnames derived of some\naccident at their birth. As to this day they call him Proculeius,\nthat is born, his father being in some far voyage: and him\nPosthumius, that is born after the death of his father. And\n\n\n\nwhen of two brethren twins, the one cloth die, and the other\nsurviveth, they call the survivor Vopiscus. Sometime also\nthey give surnames derived of some mark or misfortune of the\nbody: as Sylla, to say, crook-nosed: Niger, black: Rufus, red:\nCaecus, blind: Claudus, lame. They did wisely in this thing to\naccustom men to think, that neither the loss of their sight, nor\nother such misfortunes as may chance to men, are any shame\nor disgrace unto them; but the manner was to answer boldly to\nsuch names, as if they were called by their proper names.\nHowbeit these matters would be better amplified in other stories\nthan this.\n\n\n                  \n                   Now when this war was ended, the flatterers of the people\nbegan to stir up sedition again, without any new occasion,\nor just matter offered of complaint. For they did \n\n                  \nthis\nsecond insurrection against the Nobility and Patricians upon\nthe people's misery and misfortune, that could not but  \n\n                  ,\n\nby reason of the former discord and sedition between them and\nthe Nobility. Because the most part of the arable land, within\nthe territory of Rome, was become \n\n                  \nand barren for lack of\nploughing, for that they had no time nor \n\n                  \nto cause corn\nto be brought them out of other countries to sow, by reason of\ntheir wars; which made the extreme dearth they had among\nthem. Now those busy prattlers that sought the people's goodwill\nby such flattering words, perceiving great scarcity of corn\nto be within the city: and though there had been plenty enough,\nyet the common people had no money to buy it: they spread\nabroad false tales and rumours against the Nobility, that they,\nin revenge \n\n                  \nthe people, had \n\n                  \nand \n\n                  \nthe extreme\ndearth among them. Furthermore, in the midst of this\nstir, there came ambassadors to Rome from the city of Velitres,\nthat offered up their city to the Romans, and prayed them they\nwould send new inhabitants to replenish the same: because the\nplague had been so extreme among them, and had killed such a\nnumber of them, \n\n                  \nthere was not left alive the tenth person of\nthe people that had been there before. So the wise men of\nRome began to think, that the necessity of the Velitrians  \n\n                  \n\nin a most happy hour; and how, by this \n\n                  ,\nit was very\nmeet, in so great a scarcity of victuals, to disburden Rome of a\ngreat number of citizens: and by this means as well to take\naway this new sedition, and utterly to rid it out of the city, as\nalso to clear the same of many mutinous and seditious persons,\nbeing the superfluous ill humours that grievously fed this disease.\n\n                  Hereupon the Consuls \n\n                  \nall those by a \n\n                  ,\n\nwhom they intended to send to Velitres, to go dwell there as in\nform of a colony: and they levied out all the rest that remained\nin the city of Rome, a great number to go against the Volsces,\nhoping, by the \n\n                  \nof foreign war, to pacify their sedition at\nhome. Moreover they imagined, when the poor with the rich.\nand the mean sort with the Nobility, should by this device be\nabroad in the wars, and in one camp, and in one service, and in\none like danger: that then they would be more quiet and loving\ntogether. \n\n                  But Sicinius and Brutus, two seditious Tribunes,\nspake against either of these devices, and cried out upon the\nnoble men, that under the gentle name of a Colony, they would\n\n                  \nthe most cruel and unnatural \n\n                  \nas might\nbe: because they sent their poor citizens into a sore infected\ncity and pestilent air, full of dead bodies unburied, and there\nalso to dwell under the \n\n                  \nof a strange god, that had so\ncruelly persecuted his people. \" This were (said they) even as\nmuch, as if the Senate should headlong cast down the people\ninto a most bottomless pit; and are not yet contented to have\nfamished some of the poor citizens heretofore to death, and to\nput other of them even to the mercy of the plague: but afresh\nthey have \n\n                  \na voluntary war, to the end they would\nleave behind no kind of misery and ill, wherewith the poor silly\npeople should not be plagued, and only because they are weary\nto serve the rich.\" The common people, being set on a broil and\n\n\n                  \nwith these words, would not appear when the Consuls\ncalled their names by a \n\n                  ,\nto \n\n                  \nthem for the wars, neither\nwould they be sent out to this new colony: insomuch as the\nSenate knew not well what to say or to do in the matter.\n\n Martius then, who was now grown to great credit, and a\nstout man besides, and of great reputation with the noblest men\nof Rome, rose up, and openly spake against these flattering Tribunes.\nAnd for the replenishing of the city of Velitres, he did\ncompel those that were chosen, to go thither and to \n\n                  \nthe\ncity, upon great penalties to him that should disobey: but to the\nwars the people by no means would be brought or constrained.\nSo Martius, taking his friends and followers with him, and such\nas he could by fair words intreat to go with him, did run certain\nforays into the dominion of the Antiates, where he met with\ngreat plenty of corn, and had a marvellous great spoil, as well\nof cattle as of men he had taken prisoners, whom he brought\naway with him, and reserved nothing for himself. Afterwards, \n\n\n\nhaving brought back again all his men that went out with him,\nsafe and sound to Rome, and every man rich and \n\n                  \nwith\nspoil: then the home-tarriers and \n\n                  \nthat \n\n                  \nRome\nstill, began to repent them that it was not their \n\n                  \nto go with\nhim, and so envied both them that had sped so well in this\njourney; and also, of malice to Martius, they \n\n                  \nto see his\ncredit and estimation increase still more and more, because\nthey accounted him to be a great hinderer of the people.\n\n\nShortly after this, Martius stood for the Consulship: and the\ncommon people favoured his suit, thinking it would be a shame\nto them to deny and refuse the chiefest noble man of blood,\nand most worthy person of Rome, and specially him that had\ndone so great service and good to the commonwealth. For the\ncustom of Rome was at that time, that such as did sue for any\noffice, should for certain days before be in the market-place, \n\n                  \na poor gown on their backs, and without any coat underneath,\nto pray the citizens to remember them at the day of\nelection: which was thus devised, either to move the people the\nmore, by requesting them in such mean apparel, or else because\nthey might shew them their wounds they had gotten in the wars\nin the service of the commonwealth, as manifest marks and\ntestimonies of their valiantness. Now it is not to be thought\nthat the suitors went thus loose in a simple gown in the marketplace,\nwithout any coat under it, for fear and suspicion of the\ncommon people: for offices of dignity in the city were not then\ngiven by favour or corruption. It was but of late time, and long\nafter this, that buying and selling \n\n                  \nin election of officers,\nand that the voices of the electors were bought for money. But\nafter corruption had once gotten way into the election of offices,\nit hath run from man to man, even to the very sentence of\njudges, and also among captains in the wars: so as in the end,\n\n                  \nfumed commonwealths into kingdoms, by making\narms subject to money. Therefore me thinks he  \n\n                  \n\nthat said: \"he that first made banquets and gave money to the\ncommon people, was the first that took away authority, and destroyed\ncommonwealth.\" But this pestilence crept in by little\nand little, and did secretly win ground \n\n                  ,\ncontinuing a long\ntime in Rome, before it was openly known and discovered. For\nno man can tell who was the first man that bought the people's\nvoices for money, nor that corrupted the sentence of the Judges.\nHowbeit at Athens some hold opinion, that Anytus, the son of\nAnthemion, was the first that fed the judges with money, about\n\nthe end of the wars of Peloponnesus, being accused of treason\nfor yielding up the fort of Pyle at that time, when the golden\nand \n\n                  \nage remained yet whole in judgment at Rome.\n\n\nNow Martius, following this custom, shewed many wounds and\ncuts upon his body, which he had received in seventeen years'\nservice at the wars, and in many sundry battles, being ever the\nforemost man that did set out \n\n                  \nto fight. So that there was\nnot a man among the people but was ashamed of himself, to\nrefuse so valiant a man: and one of them said to another, \"we\nmust needs choose him Consul, there is no remedy.\" But when\nthe day of election was come, and that Martius came to the\nmarket-place with great pomp, accompanied with all the Senate\nand the whole Nobility of the city about him, who sought to\nmake him Consul with the greatest \n\n                  \nand intreaty they\ncould, or ever attempted for any man or matter: then the love\nand goodwill of the common people turned straight to an hate\nand envy toward him, fearing to put this office of sovereign authority\ninto his hands, being a man somewhat partial towards\nthe Nobility, and of great credit and authority amongst the\nPatricians, and as one they might \n\n                  \nwould take away altogether\nthe liberty from the people. Whereupon, for these considerations,\nthey refused Martius in the end, and made two\nother that were suitors, Consuls. The Senate, being marvellously\noffended with the people, did account the shame of this\nrefusal rather to redound to themselves than to Martius but\nMartius took it in far worse part than the Senate, and was out\nof all patience. For he was a man too full of passion and\ncholer, and too much given over to self-will and \n\n                  ,\nas one\nof a high mind and great courage, that lacked the gravity and \naffability that is gotten with judgment of learning and reason,\nwhich only is to be \n\n                  \nin a governor of State: and that\nremembered not how wilfulness is the thing \n\n                  \nthe world, which \na governor of a commonwealth,  \n\n                  ,\nshould shun, being \nthat which Plato called 'solitariness'; as in the end, all men\nthat are wilfully given to a self-opinion and obstinate mind, and\nwho will never yield to other's reason but to their own. remain\nwithout company, and forsaken of all men. For a man that \n\n                  \n\nlive in the world must needs have patience, which lusty bloods\nmake but a mock at. So Martius, being a stout man of nature,\n\nthat never yielded in any respect, as one thinking that to overcome \nalways and to have the upper hand in all matters, was a\ntoken of magnanimity and of no base and faint \n\n                  ,\nwhich\n\n\nspitteth out anger from the most weak and \n\n                  \npart of\nthe heart, much like the \n\n                  \nof an \n\n                  :\nwent home\nto his house, full freighted with spite and malice against, the people,\nbeing accompanied with all the \n\n                  \nyoung gentlemen, whose\nminds were nobly bent, as those that came of noble race, and\ncommonly \n\n                  \nfor to follow and honour him. But then specially\nthey flocked about him, and kept him company to his\n\n\n                  \nharm, for they did but kindle and inflame his choler more\nand more, being sorry with him for the injury the people offered\nhim; because he was their captain and leader to the wars, that\ntaught them all martial discipline, and stirred up in them a\nnoble emulation of honour and valiantness, and yet, without\nenvy, praising them that deserved best.\n\n\n                  \n                  In the mean season there came great plenty of corn to\nRome, that had been bought, part in Italy, and part was sent\nout of Sicily, as given by Gelon the tyrant of Syracusa: so that\nmany stood in great hope, that the dearth of victuals being\n\n\n                  ,\nthe civil dissension would also cease. The Senate sat\nin council upon it immediately; the common people stood also\nabout the palace where the council was kept, \n\n                  \nwhat \n\n                  \n\nwould\n\n                  :\npersuading themselves that the corn they\nhad bought should be sold good \n\n                  ,\nand that which was\ngiven should be divided by the \n\n                  ,\nwithout paying any penny;\nand the rather, because certain of the Senators amongst them\ndid so wish and persuade the same. But Martius, standing\nupon his feet, did somewhat sharply  \n\n                  \nthose who \n\n\n                  \nto gratify the people therein: and called them people-pleasers,\nand traitors to the Nobility. \" Moreover,\" he said,\n\"they nourished against themselves the \n\n                  \nseed and\n\n\n                  \nof insolence and sedition, which had been sowed and\nscattered abroad amongst the people, which they should have\ncut off, if they had been wise, in their growth: and not (to\ntheir own destruction) have suffered the people to establish a\nmagistrate for themselves, of so great power and authority as\nthat man had to whom they had granted it. Who was also\nto be feared, because he obtained what he \n\n                  ,\nand did\nnothing but what he \n\n                  ,\nneither\n\n                  \nany obedience\nto the Consuls, but lived in all liberty; acknowledging no superior\nto command him, \n\n                  \nheads and authors of\ntheir faction, whom he called his magistrates. Therefore,\" said\nhe, \"they that gave counsel and persuaded, that the corn\nshould be given out to the common people gratis, as they\n\nused to do in the cities of Greece, where the people had more \nabsolute power, did but only nourish their disobedience, which\nwould break out in the end, to the utter ruin and overthrow\nof the whole state. For they will not think it is done in recompence\nof their service past, \n\n                  \nthey know well enough\nthey have so oft refused to go to the wars when they were\ncommanded: neither for their mutinies when they went with\nus, whereby they have rebelled and forsaken their country:\nneither for their accusations which their flatterers have preferred\nunto them, and they have received, and made good\nagainst the Senate: but they will rather judge, we give and\ngrant them this as abasing ourselves, and standing in fear of \nthem, and glad to flatter them every way. By this means \ntheir disobedience will still grow worse and worse: and they\nwill never \n\n                  \nto practice new sedition and uproars. Therefore\nit were a great folly for us, methinks, to do it: yea, shall\nI say more? we should, if we were wise, take from them their \nTribuneship, which most manifestly is the embasing of the \nConsulship, and the cause of the division of the city. The\nstate whereof, as it standeth, is not now as it was wont to be,\nbut becometh dismembered in two factions, which maintains\nalways civil dissension and discord between us, and will never\nsuffer us again to be united into one body.\" \n\nMartius dilating\nthe matter with many such like reasons, won all the young\nmen, and almost all the rich men to his opinion: insomuch as\nthey \n\n                  ,\nthat he was the only man, and alone in the\ncity, who stood out against the people, and never flattered\nthem. There were only a few old men that spake against him,\nfearing lest some mischief \n\n                  ,\nas indeed\nthere followed no great good afterward. For the Tribunes of\nthe people, being present at this consultation of the Senate,\nwhen they saw that the opinion of Martius was confirmed with\nthe \n\n                  \nvoices, they left the Senate, and went down to the\npeople, crying out for help, and that they would assemble to\nsave their Tribunes. Hereupon the people \n\n                  \nin tumult\ntogether, before whom the words that Martius spake in the\nSenate were openly reported: which the people so \n\n                  ,\n\nthat even in that fury they were ready to fly upon the whole\nSenate. But the Tribunes laid all the fault and \n\n                  \nwholly\nupon Martius, and sent their sergeants forthwith to arrest him,\n\n\n                  \nto appear in person before the people, to answer the\nwords he had spoken in the Senate. Martius stoutly withstood\n\n\n\nthese officers that came to arrest him. Then the Tribunes in\ntheir own persons, accompanied with the Aediles, went to fetch\nhim by force, and so laid violent hands upon him. Howbeit the\nnoble Patricians gathering together about him, made the Tribunes\n \n\n                  ,\nand laid sore upon the Aediles: so for that\ntime the night parted them, and the tumult appeased. The\nnext morning betimes, the Consuls seeing the people in an uproar,\nrunning to the market-place out of all parts of the city,\nthey were afraid lest all the city \n\n                  \ntogether by the ears:\nwherefore assembling the Senate in all haste, they declared how\nit \n\n                  ,\nto appease the fury of the people with some\ngentle words or grateful decrees in their favour: and moreover,\nlike wise men they should consider, it was now no time to stand\nat defence and in contention, nor yet to fight for honour against\nthe commonalty, they being fallen to so great an extremity, and\noffering such imminent danger. Wherefore they were to consider\ntemperately of things, and to deliver some present and\ngentle pacification. The most part of the Senators that were\npresent at this council, thought this opinion best, and gave\ntheir consents unto it. Whereupon the Consuls rising out of\ncouncil, went to speak unto the people as gently as they could,\nand they did pacify their fury and anger, \n\n                  \nthe Senate of\nall the unjust accusations laid upon them, and used great \n\n                  \n\nin persuading them, and also in reproving the faults they\nhad committed. And as for the rest, that touched the sale of\ncorn, they promised there should be no \n\n                  \noffered them\nin the price. \n\nSo the most part of the people being pacified,\nand appearing so plainly by the great silence that was among\nthem, as yielding to the Consuls and \n\n                  \ntheir words:\nthe Tribunes then of the people rose out of their seats, and\nsaid: \" Forasmuch as the Senate yielded unto reason, the people\nalso for their part, as became them, did likewise give place unto\nthem: but notwithstanding, they \n\n                  \nthat Martius should\ncome in person to answer to the articles they had devised.\nFirst, whether he had not solicited and \n\n                  \nthe Senate to\nchange the present state of the commonweal, and to take the\nsovereign authority out of the people's hands? Next, when he\nwas sent for by authority of their officers, why he did contemptuously\nresist and disobey? Lastly, seeing he had driven and\nbeaten the Aediles into the market-place before all the world: if,\nin doing this, he had not done as much as in him lay, to raise\ncivil wars, and to set one citizen against another?\" All this was\n\nspoken to one of these two ends, either that Martius, against his\nnature, should be constrained to humble himself and to abase\nhis haughty and fierce mind: or else, if he continued still in his\n\n\n                  ,\nhe should incur the people's displeasure and ill-will\nso far, that he should never possibly win them again. Which\nthey hoped would rather \n\n                  \nso, than otherwise: as indeed\nthey guessed unhappily, considering Martius' nature and disposition.\n\n\n So Martius came and presented himself to answer their\naccusations against him, and the people held their peace, and\ngave attentive ear, to hear what he would say. But where they\nthought to have heard very humble and lowly words come from\nhim, he began not only to use his wonted boldness of speaking\n(which of itself was very rough and unpleasant, and did more\naggravate his accusation, than \n\n                  \nhis \n\n                  \n) but also\ngave himself in his words to thunder, and look therewithal so\ngrimly, as though he made no reckoning of the matter. This\nstirred coals among the people, who were in wonderful fury at\nit, and their hate and malice grew so toward him, that they\ncould hold no longer, bear, nor endure his \n\n                  \nand careless\nboldness. Whereupon Sicinius, the cruellest and stoutest of the\nTribunes, after he had whispered a little with his companions,\ndid openly pronounce, in the face of all the people, Martius as\ncondemned by the Tribunes to die. Then presently he commanded\nthe Aediles to apprehend him, and carry him straight\nto the rock Tarpeian, and to cast him headlong down the same.\nWhen the Aediles came to lay hands upon Martius to do \n\n                  \n\nthey were commanded, divers of the people themselves thought\nit too cruel and violent a deed. The noblemen, being much\ntroubled to see so much force and rigour used, began to cry\naloud 'help Martius': so those that laid hands on him being\nrepulsed, they compassed him \n\n                  \namong themselves, and\nsome of them, holding up their hands to the people, besought\nthem not to handle him thus cruelly. But neither their words\nnor crying out could aught prevail, the tumult and \n\n                  \n\nwas so great, until such time as the Tribunes' own friends and\nkinsmen, weighing with themselves the \n\n                  \nto convey\nMartius to execution without great slaughter and murder of the\nnobility, did persuade and advise not to proceed in so violent\nand extraordinary a sort, as to put such a man to death without\nlawful process in law, but that they should refer the sentence of\nhis death to the free voice of the people. Then Sicinius, bethinking\n\nhimself a little, did ask the Patricians, for what cause\nthey took Martius out of the officers' hands that went to do execution? \nThe Patricians asked him again, why they would of\nthemselves so cruelly and wickedly put to death so noble and\nvaliant a Roman as Martius was, and that without law and justice? \n\"Well then,\" said Sicinius, \"if that be the matter, let there\nbe no quarrel or dissension against the people: for they do\ngrant your demand, that his cause shall be heard according to\nthe law. Therefore,\" said he to Martius, \"we do \n\n                  \nand charge\nyou to appear before the people, the third day of our next sitting\nand assembly here, to make your purgation for such articles as\nshall be objected against you, that by free voice the people may\ngive sentence upon you as shall please them. The noblemen\nwere glad then of the adjournment, and were much pleased they\nhad gotten Martius out of this danger. \n\nIn the mean space\nbefore the third day of their next session \n\n                  ,\nthe same\nbeing kept every ninth day continually at Rome, \n\n                  \n\nthey call it now in Latin : there \n\n                  \nwar against\nthe Antiates, which gave some hope to the nobility that this\nadjournment would come to little effect, thinking that this war\nwould hold them so long, as that the fury of the people against\nhim would be well \n\n                  ,\nor utterly forgotten, by reason of\nthe trouble of the wars.  But contrary to expectation, the peace\nwas concluded \n\n                  \nwith the Antiates, and the people returned\nagain to Rome. Then the Patricians assembled oftentimes\ntogether, to consult how they might \n\n                  \nMartius, and\nkeep the Tribunes from \n\n                  \nto cause the people to \n\n                  \n\nagain, and rise against the Nobility. And there Appius Claudius\n(one that was \n\n                  \never as an heavy enemy to the people)\ndid avow and protest, that they would utterly abase the authority\nof the Senate, and destroy the commonweal, if they would\nsuffer the common people to have authority by voices to give\njudgment against the Nobility. On the other side again, the\nmost ancient Senators, and such as were given to favour the\ncommon people, said: \" that when the people should see they had\nauthority of life and death in their hands, they would not be so\ncruel and fierce, but gentle and \n\n                  .\nMore also, that it was not\nfor contempt of Nobility or the Senate that they sought to have\nthe authority of justice in their hands, as a pre-eminence and\nprerogative of honour: but because they feared, that themselves\nshould be contemned and hated of the Nobility. So \n\n                  \nthey\nwere persuaded, that so soon as they gave them authority to\n\n\njudge by voices, they would \n\n                  \nall envy and malice to condemn\nany.\"\n\nMartius, seeing the Senate in great doubt how to\n\n\n                  ,\npartly for the love and goodwill the nobility did bear\nhim, and partly for the fear they stood in of the people: asked\naloud of the Tribunes, 'what matter they would \n\n                  \nhim\nwith?' The Tribunes answered him, 'that they would shew how\nhe did aspire to be King, and would prove that all his actions\ntended to usurp tyrannical power over Rome.' Martius with\nthat, rising upon his feet, said: 'that \n\n                  \nhe did willingly \noffer himself to the people, to be tried upon that accusation: \nand that if it were \n\n                  \nhim, he had so much as once\nthought of any such matter, that he would then refuse no kind\nof punishment they would offer him: conditionally (quoth he)\nthat you charge me with nothing else beside, and that ye do not\nalso abuse the Senate.' They promised they would not. Under\nthese conditions the judgment was agreed upon, and the people\nassembled.\n\n And first of all the Tribunes \n\n                  \nin any case (whatsoever\n\n\n                  \nof it) that the people should proceed to give\ntheir voices by Tribes, and not by hundreds: for by this means\nthe multitude of the poor needy people (and all such rabble as\nhad nothing to lose, and had less regard of honesty before their\neyes) came to be of greater force (because their voices were\nnumbered by the \n\n                  \n) than the noble honest citizens, whose\npersons and purse did dutifully serve the commonwealth in\ntheir wars. And then, when the Tribunes saw they could not\nprove he \n\n                  \nto make himself King, they began to\nbroach afresh the former words that Martius had spoken in the\nSenate, in hindering the distribution of the corn at \n\n                  \nprice\nunto the common people, and persuading also to take the office\nof Tribuneship from them. And for the third, they charged\nhim anew, that he had not made the common distribution of\nthe spoil he had gotten in the invading the territories of the\nAntiates: but had of his own authority divided it among them\nwho were with him in that journey. But this matter was most\nstrange of all to Martius, \n\n                  \nleast to have been \n\n                  \n\nwith that as with any matter of offence. Whereupon being\nburdened on the sudden, and having no ready excuse to make\neven at that instant: he began to fall a praising of the soldiers\nthat had served with him in that journey. But those that were\nnot with him, being the greater number, cried out so loud, and\nmade such a noise, that he could not be heard. To conclude,\n\nwhen they came to \n\n                  \nthe voices of the Tribes, there were\nthree voices odd, which condemned him to be banished for\never. After declaration of the sentence, the people made such\njoy, \n\n                  \nthey never rejoiced more for any battle they had won\nupon their enemies, they were so brave and lively, and went\nhome so jocundIy from the assembly, for triumph of this sentence.\nThe Senate again, \n\n                  ,\nwere as sad and\nheavy, repenting themselves beyond measure, that they had not\nrather determined to have done and suffered anything whatsoever,\nbefore the common people should so arrogantly and outrageously\nhave \n\n                  \ntheir authority. There needed no difference\nof garments, I warrant you, nor outward shows, to know a\nPlebeian from a Patrician, for they were easily discerned by their\nlooks. For he that was on the people's side looked cheerfully\non the matter: but he that was sad and hung down his head,\nhe was \n\n                  \nof the noblemen's side: \n\nsaving Martius alone, who\nneither in his countenance nor in his gait did ever shew himself\nabashed, or once let fall his great courage: but he only, of\nall other gentlemen that were angry at his fortune, did outwardly\nshew no manner of passion, nor care at all of himself.\nNot that he did patiently bear and \n\n                  \nhis \n\n                  \nin respect\nof any reason he had, or by his quiet condition: but because\nhe was so carried away with the vehemency of anger and\ndesire of revenge, that he had no sense nor feeling of the hard\nstate he was in: which the common people judge not to be sorrow,\nalthough indeed it be the very same. For when sorrow (as\nyou would say) is set on fire, then it is converted into spite and\nmalice, and driveth away for that time all faintness of heart and\nnatural fear. And this is the cause why the choleric man is so\naltered and mad in his actions, as a man set on fire with a\nburning ague: for when a man's heart is troubled within, his\npulse will beat marvellous strongly. Now that Martius was\neven in that \n\n                  \nit appeared true soon after by his doings.\nFor when he was come home to his house again, and had taken\nhis leave of his mother and wife, finding them weeping and\nshrieking out for sorrow, and had also comforted and persuaded\nthem to be content with his chance: he went immediately to\nthe gate of the city, accompanied with a great number of Patricians,\nthat brought him thither, from whence he went on his\nway with three or four of his friends only, taking nothing with\nhim, nor requesting anything of any man. So he remained a\nfew days in the country at his houses, \n\n                  \nwith sundry\n\nsorts and kinds of thoughts, such as the fire of his choler did\nstir up.\n\n In the end, seeing he could \n\n                  \nno way to take a\nprofitable or honourable course, but only was pricked forward\nstill to be revenged of the Romans: he thought to raise up\nsome great wars against them, by their nearest neighbours.\nWhereupon he thought it his best way, first to stir up the Volsces\nagainst them, knowing they were yet able enough in\nstrength and riches to encounter them, notwithstanding their\nformer losses they had received not long before, and that their\npower was not so much impaired, as their malice and desire \nwas increased to be revenged of the Romans.\n\n\n                   Now in the city \nof Antium there was one called Tullus Aufidius, who for his \nriches, as also for his nobility and valiantness, was honoured \namong the Volsces as a king. Martius knew very well that\nTullus did more \n\n                  \nand envy him than he did all the Romans \nbesides: because that many times, in battles where they \nmet, they were ever at the encounter one against another, like\nlusty courageous youths striving in all emulation of honour, and \nhad encountered many times together. Insomuch as, besides\nthe common quarrel between them, there was bred a marvellous \nprivate hate one against another. Yet notwithstanding, considering\nthat Tullus Aufidius was a man of a great mind, and\nthat he above all other of the Volsces most desired revenge of\nthe Romans, for the injuries they had done unto them: he did \nan act that confirmed the words of an ancient poet to be true,\nwho said:\n\n\nAnd so did he. For he disguised himself in such array and\nattire, as he thought no man could ever have known him for the\nperson he was, seeing him in that apparel he had upon his\nback: and as Homer said of Ulysses:\n\n\n\n                  \n                  It was even twilight when he entered the city of Antium, and \nmany people met him in the streets, but no man knew him. So\nhe went directly to Tullus Aufidius' house, and when he came\nthither, he \n\n                  \nup straight to the chimney-hearth, and sat\nhim down, and spake not a word to any man, his face all muffled\n\nover. They of the house spying him, wondered what he\nshould be, and yet they durst not bid him rise. For ill-favouredly\nmuffled and disguised as he was, yet there appeared a\ncertain majesty in his countenance and in his silence: whereupon\nthey went to Tullus, who was at supper, to tell him of the\nstrange disguising of this man. Tullus rose \n\n                  \nfrom the\nboard, and coming towards him, asked him what he was, and\nwherefore he came. Then Martius unmuffled himself, and after\nhe had paused awhile, making no answer, he said unto him: \"If\nthou knowest me not yet, Tullus, and, seeing me, cost not perhaps\nbelieve me to be the man I am indeed, I must of necessity\n\n\n                  \nmyself to be that I am. I am Caius Martius, who hath\ndone to thyself particularly, and to all the Volsces generally,\ngreat hurt and mischief, which I cannot deny \n\n                  \nmy surname\nof Coriolanus that I hear. For I never had other benefit nor\nrecompence of the true and \n\n                  \nservice I have done, and\nthe extreme dangers I have been in, but this only surname: a\ngood memory and witness of the malice and displeasure thou\nshouldest bear me. Indeed the name only remaineth with\nme: for the rest the envy and cruelty of the people of Rome\nhave taken from me, by the sufferance of the dastardly nobility\nand magistrates, who have forsaken me, and let me be\nbanished by the people. This extremity hath now driven me\nto come as a poor suitor, to take thy chimney-hearth, not of\nany hope I have to save my life thereby for if I had feared\ndeath, I would not have come hither to have put myself in\nhazard: but \n\n                  \nwith desire to be revenged of\nthem that thus have banished me; which now I do begin, in\nputting my person into the hands of their enemies. Wherefore,\nif thou hast any heart to be \n\n                  \nof the injuries thy\nenemies have done thee, \n\n                  \nnow, and let my misery\nserve thy turn, and so use it as my service may be a benefit\nto the Volsces: promising thee, that I will fight with better\ngood will for all you than I did when I w as against you,\nknowing that they fight more valiantly who know the force of\nthe enemy, than such as have never proved it. And if it be\nso that thou dare not, and that thou art weary to \n\n                  \nfortune\nany more, then am I also weary to live any longer. And it\nwere no wisdom in thee, to save the life of him, who hath\nbeen heretofore thy mortal enemy, and whose service now can\nnothing help nor \n\n                  \nthee.\" Tullus, hearing what he said,\nwas a marvellous glad man, and taking him by the hand, he\n\n\nsaid unto him: \" Stand up, O Martius, and be of good cheer, for\nin proffering thyself unto us thou doest us great honour: and\nby this means thou mayest hope also of greater things at all the\nVolsces' hands. So he feasted him for that time, and entertained\nhim in the honourablest manner he could, talking with\nhim of no other matter at that present: but within few days\nafter they fell to consultation together, in what sort they should\nbegin their wars.\n\n\n                  \n                   Now on the other side, the city of Rome was in marvellous \nuproar and discord, the nobility against the commonalty,\nand chiefly for Martius' condemnation and banishment. Moreover\nthe priests, the soothsayers, and private men also, came\nand declared to the Senate certain sights and wonders in the\nair, which they had seen, and were to be considered of: amongst\nthe which such a vision happened: There was a citizen of Rome\ncalled Titus Latinus, a man of mean quality and condition, but\notherwise an honest sober man, given to a quiet life, without\nsuperstition, and much less to vanity or lying. This man had\na vision in his dream, in the which he thought that Jupiter appeared\nunto him, and commanded him to signify to the Senate,\nthat they had caused a very vile lewd dancer to go before the\nprocession: and said, the first time this vision had appeared\nunto him, he made no reckoning of it: and coming again another\ntime into his mind, he made not much more account of the\nmatter than before. In the end, he saw one of his sons die,\nwho had the best nature and condition of all his brethren: and\nsuddenly he himself was so taken in all his limbs, that he became\nlame and impotent. Hereupon he told the whole circumstance\nof this vision before the Senate, sitting upon his little\ncouch or bed, whereon he was carried on men's arms: and he\nhad no sooner reported this vision to the Senate, but he\n\n\n                  \nfelt his body and limbs restored again to their former \nstrength and use. So raising up himself upon his couch, he\ngot up on his feet at that instant, and walked home to his\nhouse, without help of any man. The Senate being amazed at\nthis matter, made diligent enquiry to understand the truth:\nand in the end they found there was such a thing: There was\none that had delivered a bondman of his that had offended him\ninto the hands of other slaves and bondmen, and had commanded\nthem to whip him up and down the market-place, and\nafterwards to kill him: and as they had him in \n\n                  ,\n\nwhipping him cruelly, they did so \n\n                  \nthe poor wretch, that,\n\nfor the cruel smart and pain he felt, he turned and writhed his\nbody in strange and pitiful sort. The procession by chance\ncame by even at the same time, and many that followed it\nwere heartily moved and offended with the sight, saying: that\nthis was no good sight to behold, nor meet to be met in procession\ntime. But for all this, there was nothing done: saving\nthey blamed and rebuked him that punished his slave so cruelly.\nFor the Romans at that time did use their bondmen very\ngently, because they themselves did labour with their own\nhands, and lived with them and among them: and therefore\nthey did use them the more gently and familiarly. For the\ngreatest punishment they gave a slave that had offended, was\nthis. They made him carry a \n\n                  \non his shoulders that is\nfastened to the axletree of a coach, and compelled him to go\nup and down in that sort amongst all their neighbours. He\nthat had once \n\n                  \nthis punishment, and was seen in that\nmanner, was proclaimed and cried in every market-town: so\nthat no man would ever trust him after, and they called him\n\n                  , because the Latins call the wood that runneth into the\naxletree of the coach , as much to say as a fork. \n\nNow\nwhen Latinus had made report to the Senate of the vision that\nhad happened to him, they were devising whom this unpleasant\ndancer should be, that went before the procession. Thereupon\ncertain that stood by remembered the poor slave that was so\ncruelly whipped through the market-place, whom they afterwards\nput to death: and the thing that made him remember it;\nwas the strange and rare manner of h s punishment. The\npriests hereupon were repaired unto for their advice: they were\nwholly of opinion, that it was the whipping of the slave. So\nthey caused the slave's master to be punished, and began again\na new procession, and all other shows and sights in honour of\nJupiter. But hereby appeareth plainly, how king Numa did\nwisely ordain all other ceremonies concerning devotion to the\ngods, and specially this custom which he established, to bring\nthe people to religion. For when the magistrates, bishops,\npriests, or other religious ministers go about any divine service\nor matter of religion, an herald ever goeth before them, crying\nout aloud : as to say, do this, or mind this. Hereby\nthey are specially commanded, wholly to dispose themselves to\nserve God, leaving all other business and matters aside: knowing\nwell enough, that whatsoever most men do, they do it as\nin a manner constrained unto it. But the Romans did ever use\n\nto begin again their sacrifices, processions, plays, and such like\nshows done in honour of the gods, not only upon such an occasion,\nbut upon lighter causes than that. As, when they went\non procession through the city, and did carry the images of\ntheir gods and such other like holy relics upon open hallowed\ncoaches or chariots, called in Latin \n                  , one of the coachhorses\nthat drew them stood still and would draw no more,\nand because also the coach-man took the reins of his bridle\nwith the left hand, they ordained that the procession should be\nbegun again anew. Of late time also, they did renew and begin\na sacrifice thirty times one after another, because they\nthought \n\n                  \nthere \n\n                  \none fault or other in the same: so\nholy and devout were they to the gods.\n\n\n                   Now Tullus and Martius had secret conference with\nthe greatest personages of the city of Antium, declaring unto\nthem that now they had good time offered them to make war\nwith the Romans, while they were in dissension one with another.\nThey answered them, they were ashamed to break the\nleague, considering that they were sworn to keep peace for two\nyears.  Howbeit, shortly after, the Romans gave them great\n\n\n                  \nto make war with them. For on a holy day, common\nplays being kept in Rome, upon some suspicion or [else report,\nthey made proclamation by sound of trumpet, that all the Volsces\nshould \n\n                  \nout of Rome before sunset. Some think this\nwas a craft and deceit of Martius, who sent one to Rome to the\nConsuls to accuse the Volsces falsely, advertising them how\nthey had made a conspiracy to set upon them while they were\nbusy in seeing these games, and also to set their city on fire.\nThis open proclamation made all the Volsces more offended\nwith the Romans than ever they were before: and Tullus, aggravating\nthe matter, did so inflame the Volsces against them,\nthat in the end they sent their ambassadors to Rome, to summon\nthem to deliver their lands and towns again, which they\nhad taken from them in times past, or to \n\n                  \n\n                  \n                  \nwars.\nThe Romans, hearing this, were marvellously nettled: and made\nno other answer but this: \" If the Volsces be the first that begin\nwar, the Romans will be the last that will end it.\" \n\n                  \n\nupon return of the Volsces' ambassadors and delivery of the\nRomans' answer, Tullus caused an assembly general to be made\nof the Volsces, and \n\n                  \nto make war upon the Romans.\nThis done, Tullus did counsel them to take Martius into their\nservice, and not to mistrust him for the remembrance of anything\n\npast, but boldly to trust him in any matter to come: for\nhe would do them more service in fighting for them than ever\nhe did them displeasure in fighting against them. \n\n\n                  So Martius\nwas called forth, who spake so excellently in the presence of\nthem all, that he was thought no less eloquent in tongue than\nwarlike in show: and \n\n                  \nhimself both expert in wars, and\nwise with valiantness. Thus he was joined in commission with\nTullus as general of the Volsces, having absolute authority between\nthem to follow and pursue the wars. But Martius, fearing\nlest \n\n                  \nof time to bring this army together with all the munition\nand \n\n                  \nof the Volsces would rob him of the \n\n                  \n\nhe had to execute his purpose and intent, left order with the\nrulers and chief of the city to assemble the rest of their power,\nand to prepare all necessary provision for the camp. Then he,\nwith the lightest soldiers he had, and that were willing to follow\nhim, stole away upon the sudden, and marched with all speed,\nand entered the territories of Rome before the Romans heard\nany news of his coming. Insomuch as the Volsces found such\nspoil in the fields, \n\n                  \nthey had more than they could spend in\ntheir camp, and were weary to drive and carry away that they\nhad. Howbeit, the gain of the spoil and the hurt they did to\nthe Romans in this invasion was the least part of his intent:\nfor his chiefest purpose was, to increase still the malice and\ndissension between the nobility and the commonalty: and to\ndraw that on, he was very careful to keep the noblemen's lands\nand goods safe from harm and burning, but spoiled all the\nwhole country besides, and would suffer no man to take or hurt\nanything of the noblemen's. This made greater stir and broil\nbetween the nobility and the people than was before. For the\nnoblemen \n\n                  \nwith the people because they had so unjustly\nbanished a man of so great velour and power. The people, on\nthe other side, accused the nobility, how they had procured\nMartius to make these wars to be revenged of them: because it\npleased them to see their goods burnt and spoiled before their\neyes, whilst themselves were well at ease, and did behold the\npeople's losses and misfortunes, knowing their own goods safe\nand out of danger: and how the war was not made against the\nnoblemen, that had the enemy abroad to keep that they had in\nsafety. Now Martius, having done his first exploit (which made\nthe Volsces bolder, and less fearful of the Romans), brought\nhome all the army again without loss of any man. \n\nAfter their\nwhole army (which was marvellous great, and very forward to\n\nservice) was assembled in one camp, they agreed to leave part\nof it for garrison in the country about, and the other part\nshould go on and make the war upon the Romans. So Martius\nbade Tullus choose, and take which of the two charges he\nliked best. Tullus made him answer, he knew by experience\nthat Martius was no less valiant than himself, and how he ever\nhad better fortune and good hap in all battles than himself\nhad. Therefore he thought it best for him to have the leading\nof those that would make the wars abroad, and himself would\n\n\n                  \nhome, to provide for the safety of the cities of his country,\nand to furnish the camp also \n\n                  \nall necessary provision abroad.\n\n So Martius, being stronger than before, went first of all\nunto the city of \n\n                  ,\ninhabited by the Romans, who willingly\nyielded themselves, and therefore had no hurt. From thence\nhe entered the country of the Latins, imagining the Romans\nwould fight with him there to defend the Latins, who were their\nconfederates, and had many times sent unto the Romans for\ntheir aid. But on the one side, the people of Rome were very\n\n\n                  \nto go: and on the other side, the Consuls being upon\n\n\n                  \nof their office, would not hazard themselves for so\nsmall a time: so that the ambassadors of the Latins returned\nhome again, and did no good. Then Martius did besiege their\ncities, and having taken by force the town of the Tolerinians,\nVicanians, Pedanians, and the Bolanians, who made resistance,\nhe sacked all their goods and took them prisoners. Such as\ndid yield themselves willingly unto him, he was as careful as\npossible might be to defend them from hurt: and because they\nshould receive no damage \n\n                  ,\nhe removed his camp as\nfar from their confines as he could. \n\nAfterwards, he took the\ncity of \n\n                  \nby assault, being about an hundred furlong from\nRome, where he had a marvellous great spoil, and put every\nman to the sword that was able to carry weapon. The other\nVolsces that were appointed to remain in garrison for defence\nof their country, hearing this good news, would tarry no longer\nat home, but armed themselves and ran to Martius' camp,\nsaying they did acknowledge no other captain but him. Hereupon\nhis fame ran through all Italy, and every one praised him\nfor a valiant captain, for that, by change of one man for another,\nsuch and so strange events fell out in the state. \n\n                  ,\n\nall went still to wrack at Rome. For, to come into the field to\nfight with the enemy, they could not abide to hear of it, they\nwere one so much against another, and full of seditious words,\n\nthe nobility against the people, and the people against the\nnobility. Until they had intelligence \n\n                  ,\nthat the\nenemies had laid siege to the city of Lavinium, in the which\nwere all the temples and images of their gods their protectors,\nand from whence came first their ancient original, for that\nAeneas at his first arrival into Italy did build that city. Then\nfell there out a marvellous sudden change of mind among the\npeople, and far more strange and contrary in the nobility.\nFor the people thought it good to repeal the condemnation and\nexile of Martius. The Senate, assembled upon it, would in no\ncase yield to that: who either did it of a selfwill to be contrary\nto the people's desire: or because Martius should not return\n\n\n                  \nthe grace and favour of the people. Or else, because\nthey were throughly angry and offended with him, that he\nwould set upon the whole, being offended but by a few, and in\nhis doings would shew himself an open enemy besides unto his\ncountry: notwithstanding the most part of them took the wrong\nthey had done him in marvellous ill part, and as if the injury\nhad been done unto themselves. Report being made of the\nSenate's resolution, the people found themselves in a \n\n                  :\n\nfor they could authorise and confirm nothing by their voices,\nunless it had been first propounded and ordained by the Senate.\n\n\nBut Martius, hearing this stir about him, was in a greater rage\nwith them than before: inasmuch as he raised his siege \n\n                  \n\nbefore the city of Lavinium, and going towards Rome,\nlodged his camp within forty furlong of the city, at the ditches\ncalled Cluiliae. His incamping so near Rome did put all the\nwhole city in a wonderful fear: howbeit for the present time it\nappeased the sedition and dissension betwixt the nobility and\nthe people. For there was no consul, senator, nor magistrate,\nthat durst once \n\n                  \nthe opinion of the people for the calling\nhome again of Martius.\n\n When they saw the women in a marvellous fear, running\nup and down the city: the temples of the gods full of old\npeople, weeping bitterly in their prayers to the gods: and finally,\nnot a man either wise or hardy to provide for their safety: then\nthey were ale of opinion, that the people had reason to call\nhome Martius again, to reconcile themselves to him, and that\nthe Senate, on the contrary part, were in marvellous great fault\nto be angry and in choler with him, when it \n\n                  \n\nrather to have gone out and intreated him. So they all agreed\ntogether to send ambassadors unto him, to let him understand\n\nhow his countrymen did call him home again, and restored him\nto all his goods, and besought him to deliver them from this\nwar. The ambassadors that were sent were Martius' familiar\nfriends and acquaintance, who looked at the least for a courteous\nwelcome \n\n                  \nhim, as of their familiar friend and kinsman.\nHowbeit they found nothing less: for at their coming they were\nbrought through the camp to the place where he was set in his\nchair of state, with a marvellous and an unspeakable majesty,\nhaving the chiefest men of the Volsces about him: so he commanded\nthem to declare openly the cause of their coming.\nWhich they delivered in the most humble and lowly words they\npossibly could devise, and with all modest countenance and\nbehaviour agreeable to the same. When they had done their\nmessage, \n\n                  \nthe injury they had done him, he answered them\nvery hotly and in great choler: but as general of the Volsces\nhe \n\n                  \nthem to restore unto the Volsces all their lands and\ncities they had taken from them in former wars: and moreover,\nthat they should give them the like honour and freedom of\nRome as they had before given to the Latins. For otherwise\nthey had no other \n\n                  \nto end this war, if they did not grant\nthese honest and just conditions of peace. Thereupon he gave\nthem thirty days respite to make him answer. So the ambassadors\nreturned straight to Rome, and Martius forthwith departed\nwith his army out of the territories of the Romans. \n\n\n                  This\nwas the first matter wherewith the Volsces (that most envied\nMartius' glory and authority) did \n\n                  \nMartius with. Among\nthose, Tullus was chief: who though he had received no private\ninjury or displeasure \n\n                  \nMartius, yet the common fault and imperfection\nof man's nature wrought in him, and it grieved him\nto see his own reputation blemished through Martius' great\nfame and honour, and so himself to be less esteemed of the\nVolsces than he was before. This \n\n                  \nthe more, because\nevery man honoured Martius, and thought he only could do all,\nand that all other governors and captains must be content with\nsuch credit and authority as he would please to countenance\nthem with. From hence they derived all their first accusations\nand secret murmurings against Martius. For private captains,\nconspiring against him, were very angry with him: and gave it\nout, that the removing of the camp was a manifest \n\n                  ,\nnot\nof the towns, nor forts, nor of arms, but of time and \n\n                  ,\n\nwhich was a loss of great importance, because it was that\nwhich in reason might both loose and bind all, and preserve\n\nthe whole. Now Martius having given the Romans thirty days\nrespite for their answer, and specially because the wars have\nnot accustomed to make any great changes in less space of\ntime than that, he thought it good \n\n                  ,\nnot to lie asleep and\nidle all the while, but went and destroyed the lands of the\nenemies' allies, and took seven great cities of theirs well inhabited,\nand the Romans durst not once put themselves into\nthe field to come to their aid and help, they were so fainthearted,\nso mistrustful, and loth besides to make wars. Insomuch\nas they properly resembled the bodies paralytic and\nloosed of their limbs and members, as those which through the\npalsy have lost all their sense and feeling.\n\n Wherefore, the time of peace expired, Martius being\nreturned into the dominions of the Romans again with all his\narmy, they sent another \n\n                  \nunto him, to pray peace,\nand the \n\n                  \nof the Volsces out of their country: that afterwards\nthey might with better leisure fall to such agreements\ntogether as should be thought most meet and necessary. For\nthe Romans were no men that would ever yield for fear. But\nif he thought the Volsces had any ground to demand reasonable\narticles and conditions, all that they would reasonably ask\nshould be granted unto by the Romans, who of themselves\nwould willingly yield to reason, conditionally, that they did lay\ndown arms. Martius to that answered: 'that, as general of the\nVolsces, he would reply nothing unto it: but yet, as a Roman\ncitizen, he would counsel them to let fall their pride, and to be\nconformable to reason, if they were wise: and that they should\nreturn again within three days, delivering up the articles agreed\nupon, which he had first delivered them. Otherwise, that he\nwould no more give them assurance or safe conduct to return\nagain into his camp with such vain and frivolous messages.'\n\n\nWhen the ambassadors were returned to Rome, and had reported\nMartius' answer to the Senate: their city being in\nextreme danger, and as it were in a terrible storm or tempest,\nthey threw out (as the common proverb saith) their holy anchor.\nFor then they appointed all the bishops, priests, ministers of\nthe gods, and keepers of holy things, and all the augurs or\nsoothsayers, which foreshew things to come by observation of\nthe flying of birds (which is an old ancient kind of prophesying\nand divination amongst the Romans) to go to Martius, apparelled\nas when they do their sacrifices: and first to intreat him\nto leave off war, and then that he would speak to his countrymen,\n\nand conclude peace with the Volsces. Martius suffered\nthem to come into his camp, but yet he granted them \n\n                  ,\nneither did he entertain them or speak more courteously\nto them, than he did the first time that they came unto\nhim, saving only that he willed them to take the one of the\ntwo: either to accept peace under the first conditions offered,\nor else to receive war. When all this goodly rabble of superstitious\npriests were returned, it was determined in council that\nnone should go out of the gates of the city, and that they should\nwatch and ward upon the walls to repulse their enemies if they\ncame to assault them: referring themselves and all their hope\nto time, and fortune's uncertain favour, not knowing otherwise\nhow to remedy the danger. Now all the city was full of tumult,\nfear, and marvellous doubt what would happen, until at the\nlength there fell out such a like matter, as Homer ofttimes said\nthey would least have thought of. For in great matters, that\nhappen seldom, Homer saith, and crieth out in this sort:\n\n\n\nAnd in another place:\n\n\n\nAnd in another place:\n\n\n\nMany reckon not of Homer, as referring matters \n\n                  ,\n\nand fables of no likelihood or troth, unto man's reason, freewill,\nor judgment, which indeed is not his meaning. But things\ntrue and likely, he maketh to depend of our own freewill and\nreason. For he oft speaketh these words:\n\n\n\nAnd in another place:\n\n\n\nAnd in another place:\n\n\n\nBut in wondrous and extraordinary things, which are done by\n\nsecret inspirations and motions, he cloth not say that God\ntaketh away from man his choice and freedom of will, but that\nhe cloth move it: neither that he cloth work desire in us, but\n\n\n                  \nto our minds certain imaginations whereby we are led\nto desire, and thereby cloth not make this our action forced, but\nopeneth the way to our will, and addeth thereto courage and\nhope of success. For either we must say, that the gods meddle\nnot with the causes and beginnings of our actions: or else what\nother means have they to help and further men? It is apparent\nthat they handle not our bodies, nor move not our feet and\nhands, when there is occasion to use them: but that part of our\nmind from which these motions proceed, is induced thereto, or\ncarried away by such objects and reasons, as God offereth\nunto it.\n\n\n                   Now the Roman ladies and gentlewomen did visit all\nthe temples and gods of the same, to make their prayers unto\nthem: but the greatest ladies (and more part of them) were\ncontinually about the a]tar of Jupiter Capitolin, among which\n\n\n                  \nby name, was Valeria, Publicola's own sister; the selfsame\nPublicola, who did such notable service to the Romans,\nboth in peace and wars, and was dead also certain years before,\nas we have declared in his life. His sister Valeria was greatly\nhonoured and reverenced among all the Romans: and did so\nmodestly and wisely behave herself, that she did not shame nor\ndishonour the house she came of. So she suddenly fell into\nsuch a fancy, as we have rehearsed before, and had (by some\ngod, as I think) taken hold of a noble device. Whereupon she\nrose and the other ladies with her, and they all together went\nstraight to the house of Volumnia, Martius' mother: and coming\nin to her, found her, and Martius' wife her daughter-in-law,\nset together, and having her husband Martius' young children\nin her lap. Now all the train of these ladies sitting in a ring\nround about her, Valeria first began to speak in this sort unto\nher: \"We ladies are come to visit you ladies (my lady Volumnia\nand Virgilia) by no direction from the Senate, nor commandment\nof other magistrate, but through the inspiration (as\nI take it) of some god above: who, having taken compassion\nand pity of our prayers, hath moved us to come unto you, to\nintreat you in a matter, as well beneficial for us as also for\nthe whole citizens in general, but to yourselves in special (if\nit please you to credit me), and shall redound to your \n\n                  \n\nfame and glory, than the daughters of the Sabines obtained\n\nin former age, when they procured loving peace, instead of\nhateful war, between their fathers and their husbands. Come\non, good ladies, and let us go all together unto Martius, to\nintreat him to take pity upon us, and also to report the truth\nunto him, how much you are bound unto the citizens: who\nnotwithstanding they have sustained great hurt and losses by\nhim, yet they have not hitherto sought revenge upon your persons\nby any discourteous usage, neither ever conceived any\nsuch thought or intent against you, but to deliver you safe\ninto his hands, though thereby they look for no better grace\nor clemency from him.\" When Valeria had spoken this unto\nthem, all the other ladies together, with one voice, confirmed \nthat she had said. Then Volumnia in this sort did answer \nher: \"My good ladies, we are partakers with you of the common \nmisery and calamity of our country, and yet our grief \nexceedeth yours the more, by reason of our particular misfortune, \nto feel the loss of my son Martius' former \n\n                  \n\nand glory, and to see his person environed now with our \nenemies in arms, rather to see him forthcoming and safe kept\nthan of any love to defend his person. But yet the greatest\ngrief of our heaped mishaps is to see our poor country brought\nto such extremity, that all the hope of the safety and preservation\nthereof is now unfortunately cast upon us simple\nwomen: because we know not what account he will make of \nus, since he hath cast from him all care of his natural country\n\nand commonweal, which heretofore he hath holden more dear\nand precious than either his mother, wife, or children. Notwithstanding,\nif ye think we can do good, we will willingly do\nw hat you will have us; bring us to him, I pray you. For if we\ncannot prevail, we may yet die at his feet, as humble suitors\nfor the safety of our country.\" \n\nHer answer ended, she took\nher daughter-in-law and Martius' children with her, and being\naccompanied with all the other Roman ladies, they went in\n\n                   together unto the Volsces' camp: whom when they saw, \nthey of themselves did both pity and reverence her, and there\nwas not a man among them that once durst say a word unto\nhen Now was Martius set then in his chair of state, with all\nthe honours of a general, and when he had spied the women\ncoming afar off, he marvelled what the matter meant: but\nafterwards knowing his wife which came foremost, he determined\nat the first to persist in his obstinate and inflexible rancour.\nBut overcome in the end with natural affection, and\n\nbeing altogether \n\n                   to see them, his heart would not serve\nhim to tarry their coming to his chair, but coming down in\nhaste he went to meet them, and first he kissed his mother,\nand embraced her a pretty while, then his wife and little children.\nAnd nature so wrought with him that the tears fell\nfrom his eyes, and he could not keep himself from making much\nof them, but yielded to the affection of his blood, as if he had\nbeen violently carried with the fury of a most swift running\nstream. \n\nAfter he had thus lovingly received them, and perceiving\nthat his mother Volumnia would begin to speak to him,\nhe called the chiefest of the council of the Volsces to hear\nwhat she would say. Then she spake in this sort: \"If we\nheld our peace, my son, and determined not to speak, the\nstate of our poor bodies, and present sight of our raiment,\nwould easily \n\n                  \nto thee what life we have led at home,\nsince thy exile and abode abroad; but think now with thyself,\nhow much more \n\n                   than all the women living, we are\ncome hither, considering that the sight which should be most\npleasant to all other to behold, spiteful fortune had made most\n\n\n                  \nto us: making myself to see my son, and my daughter\nhere her husband, besieging the walls of his native country:\nso as that which is the only comfort to all other in their adversity\nand misery, to pray unto the gods and to call to them\nfor aid, is the only thing which plungeth us into most deep\nperplexity. For we cannot, alas! together pray both for victory\nto our country and for safety of thy life also: but a world\nof grievous curses, yea, more than any mortal enemy can heap\nupon us, are forcibly wrapt up in our prayers. For the bitter\nsop of most hard choice is offered thy wife and children, to\nforego one of the two: either to lose the person of thyself, or\nthe nurse of their native country. For myself, my son, I am\ndetermined not to tarry till fortune, in my lifetime, do make an\nend of this war. For if I cannot persuade thee, rather to do\ngood unto both parties than to overthrow and destroy the one,\npreferring love and nature before the malice and calamity of\nwars, thou shalt see, my son, and trust unto it, thou shalt no\nsooner march forward to assault thy country, but thy foot shall\ntread upon thy mother's womb, that brought thee first into this\nworld. And I may not \n\n                  \nto see the day, either that my son\nbe led prisoner in triumph by his natural countrymen, or that\nhe himself do triumph \n\n                  \nthem, and of his natural country. For\nif it were so, that my request tended to save thy country, in\n\ndestroying the Volsces, I must confess, thou wouldest hardly\nand doubtfully resolve on that. For as, to destroy thy natural\ncountry, it is altogether unmeet and unlawful, so were it not\njust, and less honourable, to betray those that put their trust\nin thee. But my \n\n                  \ndemand consisteth, to make a gaol-delivery\nof all evils, which delivereth equal benefit and safety\nboth to the one and the other, but most honourable for the\nVolsces. For it shall appear, that, having victory in their\nhands, they have of special favour granted us singular graces,\npeace, and amity, albeit themselves have no less part of both\nthan we. Of which good, if so it came to pass, thyself is the\n\n\n                  \nauthor, and so hast thou the \n\n                  \nhonour. But if it fail\nand fall out contrary, thyself alone deservedly shalt carry the\nshameful reproach and burthen of either party. So, though the\nend of war be uncertain, yet this notwithstanding is most certain,\nthat, if it be thy chance to conquer, this benefit shalt thou\nreap of thy goodly conquest, to be \n\n                  \nthe plague and\ndestroyer of thy country. And if fortune overthrow thee, then\nthe world will say, that, through desire to revenge thy private\ninjuries, thou hast for ever undone thy good friends, who did\nmost lovingly and courteously receive thee.\"\n\nMartius gave\ngood ear unto his mother's words, without interrupting her\nspeech at all, and after she had said what she would, he held\nhis peace a pretty while, and answered not a word. Hereupon\nshe began again to speak unto him, and said: \" My son, why\ncost thou not answer me? Dost thou think it good altogether\nto give place unto thy choler and desire of revenge, and thinkest\nthou it not \n\n                  \nfor thee to grant thy mother's request,\nin so weighty a cause? Dost thou take it honourable for a\nnoble man to remember the wrongs and injuries done him,\nand cost not in like case think it an \n\n                  \nnoble man's part,\nto be thankful for the goodness that parents do shew to their\nchildren, acknowledging the duty and reverence they ought to\nbear unto them? No man living is more bound to shew himself\nthankful in all parts and respects than thyself: who so \n\n                   \nshewest all ingratitude. Moreover (my son) thou hast\nsorely taken \n\n                  \nthy country, exacting grievous payments \n\n                  \n\nthem, in revenge of the injuries offered thee; besides, thou hast\nnot hitherto shewed thy poor mother any courtesy. And therefore\nit is not only \n\n                  ,\nbut due unto me, that without compulsion\nI should obtain my so just and reasonable request of\nthee. But since by reason I cannot persuade thee to it, to what\n\n\npurpose do I defer my last hope?\" And with these words, herself,\nhis wife, and children fell down upon their knees before\nhim. Martius, seeing that, could refrain no longer, but went\nstraight and \n\n                  \nher up, crying out, \" Oh mother, what have you\ndone to me?\" And holding her hard by the right hand, \"Oh\nmother,\" said he, \" you have won a happy victory for your country,\nbut mortal and unhappy for your son: for I see myself vanquished\nby you alone.\" These words being spokes openly, he\nspake a little apart with his mother and wife, and then let them\nreturn again to Rome, for so they did request him; and so remaining\nin camp that night, the next morning he \n\n                  ,\n\nand marched homeward into the Volsces' country again, who\nwere not all of one mind, nor all alike contented. For some\n\n\n                  \nhim and that he had done: other), being well pleased\nthat peace should be made, said that neither the one nor the\nother deserved blame nor reproach. \n\n                  ,\nthough they \n\n                  \n\nthat was done, did not think him an ill man for that he\ndid, but said he was not to be blamed, though he yielded to\nsuch a forcible extremity. Howbeit no man \n\n                  \nhis departure,\nbut all obeyed his commandment, more for respect of\nhis worthiness and \n\n                  \nthan for fear of his authority.\n\n\n                   Now the citizens of Rome plainly shewed in what fear\nand danger their city stood of this war, when they were delivered.\nFor so soon as the watch upon the walls of the city perceived\nthe Volsces' camp to remove, there was not a temple in the city\nbut was \n\n                  \nset open, and full of men wearing garlands of\nflowers upon their heads, sacrificing to the gods, as they were\nwont to do upon the news of some great obtained victory. And\nthis common joy was yet more manifestly shewed by the honourable\ncourtesies the whole Senate and people did bestow on\ntheir ladies. For they were all \n\n                  \npersuaded, and did\ncertainly believe, that the ladies only were cause of the saving of\nthe city and delivering themselves from the \n\n                  \ndanger of\nthe war. Whereupon the Senate ordained that the magistrates,\nto gratify and honour these ladies, should grant them all that\nthey would require. And they only requested that they would\nbuild a temple of Fortune for the women, unto the building\nwhereof they offered themselves to defray the whole charge of\nthe sacrifices and other ceremonies belonging to the service of\nthe gods. Nevertheless the Senate, commending their goodwill\nand forwardness, ordained that the temple and image should be\nmade at the common charge of the city. Notwithstanding that,\n\nthe ladies gathered money among them, and made with the\nsame a second image of Fortune, which the Romans say did\nspeak as they offered her up in the temple and did set her in\nher place: and they affirm, that she spake these words: \"Ladies,\nye have devoutly offered me up.\" \n\nMoreover, that she spake that\ntwice together: making us to believe things that never were, and\nare not to be credited. For to see images that seem to sweat or\nweep, or to put forth any humour red or bloody, it is not a thing\n\n\n                  .\nFor wood and stone do commonly receive certain\nmoisture, whereof are ingendered humours, which do yield of\nthemselves, or do take of the air, many sorts and kinds of spots\nand colours: by which signs and tokens it is not amiss, me think,\nthat the gods sometimes do warn men of things to come. And\nit is possible also, that these images and statues do sometimes\nput forth sounds like unto sighs or mourning, when in the midst\nor bottom of the same there is made some violent separation or\nbreaking asunder of things blown or devised therein: but that\na body which hath neither life nor soul should have any direct\nor \n\n                  \nwords formed in it by express voice, that is altogether\n\n\n                  .\nFor the soul nor God himself can distinctly speak\nwithout a body, having necessary organs and instruments meet\nfor the parts of the same, to form and utter distinct words. But\nwhere stories many times do force us to believe a thing reported\nto be true, by many grave testimonies: there we must say, that\nit is some passion contrary to our five natural senses, which being\nbegotten in the imaginative part or understanding draweth\nan opinion unto itself, even as we do in our sleeping. For many\ntimes we think we hear that we do not hear, and we imagine we\nsee that we see not. Yet notwithstanding, such as are godly\nbent and zealously given to think on heavenly things, so as they\ncan no way be drawn from believing that which is spoken of\nthem, they have this reason to ground the foundation of their\nbelief upon; that is, the \n\n                  \nof God, which is wonderful,\nand hath no manner of resemblance or likeness of proportion\nunto ours, but is altogether contrary, as touching our nature, our\nmoving, our art, and our force: and therefore, if he do any thing\n\n\n                  \nto us, or do bring forth and devise things above man's\ncommon reach and understanding, we must not therefore think\nit \n\n                  \nat all. For if in other things he is far contrary to\nus, much more in his works and secret operations he far passeth\nall the rest: but the most part of God's doings, as Heraclitus\nsaith, for lack of faith, are hidden and unknown unto us.\n\n\n                  \n                   \n                  Now when Martius was returned again into the city of\nAntium from his voyage, Tullus, that hated and could no longer\nabide him for the fear he had of his authority, sought diverse\nmeans to make him away; thinking, if he let slip that present\ntime, he should never recover the like and fit occasion again.\nWherefore Tullus, having procured many other of his confederacy,\n\n\n                  \nMartius might be deposed from his estate, to render up\naccount to the Volsces of his charge and government. Martius,\nfearing to become a private man again under Tullus being\ngeneral (whose authority was greater otherwise than any other\namong all the Volsces), answered: he was willing to give up his\ncharge, and would resign it into the hands of the lords of the\nVolsces, if they did all command him, as by all their commandment\nhe received it. And moreover, that he would not refuse\neven at that present to give up an account unto the people, if\nthey would tarry the hearing of it The people hereupon called\na common council, in which assembly there were certain orators\nappointed that stirred up the common people against him: and\nwhen they had told their tales, Martius rose up to make them\nanswer. Now, notwithstanding the mutinous people made a\nmarvellous great noise, yet when they saw him, for the reverence\nthey bare unto his valiantness, they quieted themselves, and\ngave him audience to allege with leisure what he could for his\n\n\n                  .\nMoreover, the \n\n                  \nmen of the Antiates, and\nwho most rejoiced in peace, shewed by their countenance that\nthey would hear him willingly and judge also according to\ntheir conscience. Whereupon Tullus, fearing that, if he did let\nhim speak, he would prove his \n\n                  \nto the people, because\namongst other things he had an eloquent tongue; besides that\nthe first good service he had done to the people of the Volsces\ndid win him more favour than these last accusations could \n\n                  \n\n him displeasure: and furthermore, the offence they laid to\nhis charge was a testimony of the goodwill they \n\n                  \nhim; for\nthey would never have thought he had done them wrong for that\nthey took not the city of Rome, if they had not been very near\ntaking of it by means of his approach and \n\n                  .\nFor\nthese causes Tullus thought he might no longer delay his \n\n                  \n\nand enterprise, neither to tarry for the \n\n                  \nand rising of\nthe common people against him: wherefore those that were of\nthe conspiracy began to cry out that he was not to be heard,\nand that they would not suffer a traitor to usurp tyrannical power\nover the tribe of the Volsces, who would not yield up his state\n\n\nand authority. And in saying these words, they all fell upon\nhim, and killed him in the market-place, none of the people once\noffering to rescue him.\n\n \n                  Howbeit it is a clear case, that this murder was not\ngenerally consented unto \n\n                  \nthe most part of the Volsces: for\nmen came out of all parts to honour his body, and did honourably\nbury him; setting out his tomb with great store of armour\nand spoils, as the tomb of a worthy person and great captain.\nThe Romans, understanding of his death, shewed no other\nhonour or malice, saving that they granted the ladies their\nrequest they made, that they might mourn ten months for him:\nand that was the full time they used to wear \n\n                  \nfor the death\nof their fathers, brethren, or husbands, according to Numa\nPompilius' order who stablished the same, as we have enlarged\nmore amply in the description of his life. Now Martius being\ndead, the whole state of the Volsces heartily wished him alive\nagain. For, first of all, they fell out with the Aeques (who were\ntheir friends and confederates) touching \n\n                  \nand\nplace: and this quarrel grew on so far between them, that frays\nand murders fell out upon it one with another. After that, the\nRomans overcame them in battle, in which Tullus was slain in\nthe field, and the flower of all their force was put to the sword:\nso that they were compelled to accept most shameful conditions\nof peace, in yielding themselves subject unto the conquerors, and\npromising to be obedient at their commandment."}}}, {"@n": "Caes.", "front": {"div": {"@type": "toc", "pb": {"@n": "42"}, "head": "The Life of Julius Caesar", "list": {"@type": "simple", "item": [{"ref": {"@n": "para. 1", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "1.

["Alga", "Lupercalia"], "#text": "At what time Sylla was made lord of all, he would have\nhad Caesar put away his wife Cornelia, the daughter of Cinna\ndictator: but when he saw he could neither with any promise\nnor threat bring him to it, he took her jointure away from him.\nThe cause of Caesar's ill will unto Sylla was by means of marriage: \n\nfor Marius the elder married his father's own sister, by\nwhom he had Marius the younger, whereby Caesar and he were\ncousin-germans. Sylla being troubled in weighty matters, putting\nto death so many of his enemies, when he came to be\nconqueror, he made no reckoning of Caesar: and he was\nnot contented to be hidden in safety, but came and made suit\nunto the people for the priesthoodship that was \n\n                  , when he\nhad \n\n                   any hair on his face. Howbeit he was repulsed by\nSylla's means, that secretly was against him. Who, when he\nwas determined to have killed him, some of his friends told him,\nthat it was to no purpose to put so young a boy as he to death.\nBut Sylla told them again, that they did not \n\n                   that\nthere were many Marians in that young boy. Caesar understanding\nthat, stole out of Rome, and hid himself a long time\nin the country of the Sabines, wandering still from place to\nplace. But one day being carried from house to house, he fell\ninto the hands of Sylla's soldiers, who searched all those places,\nand took them whom they found hidden. Caesar bribed the\ncaptain, whose name was Cornelius, with two talents which he\ngave him.\n\n After he had escaped them thus, he went unto the seaside,\nand took ship, and sailed into Bithynia to go unto king\nNicomedes. When he had been with him awhile,  took sea\nagain, and was taken by pirates about the \n\n                   of Pharmacusa:\nfor those pirates kept all upon the sea-coast, with a great fleet\nof ships and boats. They asking him at the first twenty talents\nfor his ransom, Caesar laughed them to scorn, as though they\nknew not what a man they had taken, and of himself promised\nthem fifty talents. Then he sent his men up and down to get\nhim this money, so that he was left \n\n                   alone among\nthese thieves of the Cilicians (which are the cruellest butchers\nin the world) with one of his friends, and two of his slaves only:\nand yet he made so little reckoning of them, that when he was\ndesirous to sleep, he sent unto them to command them to make\nno noise. Thus was he thirty-eight days among them, not kept\nas prisoner, but rather waited upon by them as a prince. All\nthis time he would boldly exercise himself in any sport or\npastime they would go to. And otherwhile also he would write\nverses, and make orations, and call them together to say them\nbefore them: and if any of them seemed as though they had\nnot understood him, or \n\n                   not for them, he called them\nblockheads and brute beasts; and laughing, threatened them \n\n\nthat he would hang them up. But they were as merry with the\nmatter as could be, and took all in good part, thinking that this\nhis bold speech came through the simplicity of his youth. So\nwhen his ransom was come from the city of Miletum, they being\npaid their money, and he again set at liberty, he then \n\n                  \narmed and manned certain ships out of the haven of\nMiletum, to follow those thieves, whom he found yet riding at\n\n\n                   in the same \n\n                  . So he took the most of them, and\nhad the spoil of their goods; but \n\n                   their bodies, he brought\nthem into the city of Pergamus and there committed them to\nprison, whilst he himself went to speak with Junius, who had\nthe government of Asia, as unto whom the execution of these\npirates did belong, for that he was Praetor of that country.\nBut this Praetor, having a great fancy to be fingering of the\nmoney, because there was good store of it, answered that he\nwould consider of these prisoners at better leisure. Caesar,\nleaving Junius there, returned again unto Pergamus, and there\nhung up all these thieves openly upon a cross, as he had oftentimes\npromised them in the \n\n                   he would do, when they thought\nhe did but jest.\n\n\n                   Afterwards when Sylla's power began to decay, Caesar's\nfriends wrote unto him, to pray him to come home again. But\nhe sailed first unto Rhodes, to study there a time under Apollonius\nthe son of Molon, whose scholar also Cicero was, for\nhe was a very honest man and an excellent good rhetorician.\nIt is reported, that  Caesar had an excellent natural gift to speak\nwell before the people; and besides that rare gift, he was excellently\nwell studied, so that doubtless he was counted the second\nman for eloquence in his time, and gave place to the first,\nbecause he would be the first and chiefest man of war and\nauthority, being not yet come to the degree of perfection to\nspeak well, which his nature could have performed in him,\nbecause he was given rather to follow wars and to manage great\nmatters, which in the end brought him to be lord of all Rome.\nAnd therefore in a book he wrote against that which Cicero\nmade in the praise of Cato, he prayeth the readers not to compare\nthe style of a soldier with the eloquence of an excellent\norator, that had followed it the most part of his life. When he\nwas returned again unto Rome, he accused Dolabella for his ill\nbehaviour in the government of his provinces, and he had divers\ncities of Greece that gave in evidence against him. Notwithstanding,\nDolabella at the length was dismissed. Caesar, to\n\n\nrequite the good will of the Grecians which they had shewed\nhim in his accusation of Dolabella, took their cause in hand,\nwhen they did accuse Publius Antonius before Marcus Lucullus,\nPraetor of Macedon: and followed it so hard against him in\ntheir behalf, that Antonius was driven to appeal before the\ntribunes at Rome, alleging, to colour his appeal withal, that\nhe could have no justice in Greece against the Grecians. Now\nCaesar immediately \n\n                   many men's good wills at Rome,\nthrough his eloquence in pleading of their causes, and the\npeople loved him marvellously also, because of the courteous\nmanner he had to speak to every man, and to use them gently,\nbeing more ceremonious therein than was \n\n                   in one of\nhis years. Furthermore,  he ever kept a good board, and fared\nwell at his table, and was very liberal besides: the which indeed\ndid advance him forward, and brought him in estimation with\nthe people. His enemies, judging that this  favour of the common\npeople would soon \n\n                  , when he could no longer \nhold\nout that charge and expense, suffered him to run on, till by\nlittle and little he was grown to be of great strength and power.\nBut in fine, when they had thus given him the bridle to grow to\nthis greatness, and that they could not then pull him back, though\nindeed \n\n                   it would turn one day to the destruction of the\nwhole state and commonwealth of Rome: too late they found,\nthat there is not so little a beginning of any thing, but continuance\nof time will soon make it strong, when through contempt\nthere is no impediment to hinder the greatness.\n\n Thereupon Cicero, like a wise shipmaster that feareth\nthe calmness of the sea, was the first man that, mistrusting his\nmanner of dealing in the commonwealth, found out his craft\nand malice, which he cunningly cloaked under the habit of outward\ncourtesy and familiarity. \"And yet,\" said he, \"when I\nconsider how finely he combeth his fair bush of hair, and how\nsmooth it lieth, and that I see him scratch his head with one\nfinger only, my mind gives me then, that such a kind of man\nshould not have so wicked a thought in his head, as to overthrow\nthe state of the commonwealth.\" But this was long time\nafter that.  \n                  The first shew and proof of the love and goodwill\nwhich the people did bear unto Caesar, was when he sued to be\ntribune of the soldiers (to wit, colonel of a thousand footmen)\nstanding against Caius Pompilius, at what time he was preferred\nand chosen before him. But the second and more manifest\nproof than the first, was at the death of his aunt Julia, the\n\nwife of Marius the elder. For being her nephew, he made a\nsolemn oration in the market-place in commendation of her,\nand at her burial did boldly venture to shew forth the images of\nMarius: the which was the first time that they were seen after\nSylla's victory, because that Marius and all his confederates had\nbeen proclaimed traitors and enemies to the commonwealth.\nFor when there were some that cried out upon Caesar for doing\nof it, the people on the other side kept astir, and rejoiced at it,\nclapping of their hands; and thanked him, for that he had\nbrought, as it were out of hell, the remembrance of Marius'\nhonour again into Rome, which had so long time been obscured\nand buried. And \n\n                   it had been an ancient custom of long\ntime, that the Romans used to make funeral orations in praise\nof old ladies and matrons when they died, but not of young\nwomen: Caesar was the first that praised his own wife with\nfuneral oration when she was dead, the which also did increase\nthe people's goodwills the more, seeing him of so kind and\ngentle nature. After the burial of his wife, he was made treasurer\nunder Antistius Vetus praetor, whom he honoured ever\nafter: so that when himself came to be praetor, he made his\nson to be chosen treasurer. Afterwards, when he was come out\nof that office, he married his third wife Pompeia, having a\ndaughter by his first wife, Cornelia, which was married unto\nPompey the Great.\n\n Now \n\n                   he was very liberal in expenses, buying (as\nsome thought) but a vain and short glory of the favour of the\npeople, (\n\n                   indeed he bought good \n\n                   the greatest\nthings that could be :) some say, that before he bare any office\nin the commonwealth, he was grown in debt, to the sum of\nthirteen hundred talents. Furthermore, because he was made\noverseer of the work for the highway called Appius' way, he\ndisbursed a great sum of his own money towards the \n\n                  \nof the same. And on the other side, when he was made Aedilis,\nfor that he did shew the people the pastime of three hundred\nand twenty couple of sword-players, and did besides exceed all\nother in sumptuousness in the sports and common feasts, which\nhe made to delight them withal, and did as it were drown all\nthe stately shews of others in the like, that had gone before\nhim, he so pleased the people and \n\n                   their love therewith,\nthat they devised daily to give him new offices for to requite\nhim. At that time there were two factions in Rome, to wit,\nthe faction of Sylla, which was very strong and of great power;\n\n\nand the other of Marius, which then was under foot, and durst\nnot shew itself. But Caesar, because he would renew it again,\neven at that time when, he being Aedilis, all the feasts and\ncommon sports were in their greatest \n\n                  , he secretly caused\nimages of Marius to be made, and of victories that carried\ntriumphs; and those he set up one night within the capitol\nThe next morning, when every man saw the glistering of these\ngolden images excellently well wrought, shewing by the inscriptions\nthat they were the victories which Marius had won upon\nthe Cimbres, every one marvelled much at the boldness of him\nthat durst set them up there, knowing well enough who it was.\nHereupon it ran straight through all the city, and every man\ncame thither to see them. Then some cried out upon Caesar,\nand said, it was a tyranny which he meant to set up, by renewing\nof such honours as before had been trodden under foot and\nforgotten by common decree and open proclamation: and that\nit was no more but a bait to gauge the people's good wills, which\nhe had set out in the stately shews of his common plays, to see\nif he had brought them to his lure, that they would abide such\nparts to be played, and a new alteration of things to be made.\nThey of Marius' faction on the other side, encouraging one\nanother, shewed themselves straight a great number gathered\ntogether, and made the mount of the Capitol ring again with\ntheir cries and clapping of hands: insomuch as the tears ran\ndown many of their cheeks, for very joy, when they saw the\nimages of Marius, and they extolled Caesar to the skies, judging\nhim the worthiest man of all the \n\n                   of Marius. The\nSenate being assembled thereupon, Catulus Luctatius, one of\nthe greatest authority at that time in Rome, rose, and vehemently\ninveighed against Caesar, and spake that then which\never since hath been noted much: that Caesar did not now\ncovertly go to work, but by plain force sought to alter the state\nof the commonwealth. Nevertheless, Caesar at that time answered\nhim so, that the Senate was satisfied. Thereupon they\nthat had him in estimation did grow in better hope than before,\nand persuaded him, that \n\n                   he should give place to no\nman, and that through the goodwill of the people he should\nbe better than all they, and come to be the chiefest man of\nthe city.\n\n\n                  \n                  At that time the chief bishop Metellus died, and two\nof the notables, men of the city, and of the greatest authority\n(Isauricus and Catulus), contended for his \n\n                  : Caesar, notwithstanding \n\ntheir contention, would give neither of them both\nplace, but presented himself to the people, and made suit for it\nas they did. The suit being equal betwixt either of them,\nCatulus, because he was a man of greater calling and dignity\nthan the other, doubting the uncertainty of the election, sent\nunto Caesar a good sum of money, to make him leave off his\nsuit. But Caesar sent him word again, that he would lend a\ngreater sum than that, to maintain the suit against him. When\nthe day of the election came, his mother bringing him to the\ndoor of his house, Caesar, weeping, kissed her, and said: \" Mother,\nthis day thou shalt see thy son chief Bishop of Rome, or\nbanished from Rome.\" \n\n                  , when the voices of the people\nwere gathered together, and the strife well debated, Caesar \n\n                  \nthe victory, and made the Senate and noblemen all afraid of\nhim, for that they thought that thenceforth he would make\nthe people do what he thought good. Then Catulus and Piso\nfell flatly out with Cicero, and condemned him for that he did\nnot \n\n                   Caesar, when he knew that he was of conspiracy\nwith Catiline, and had opportunity to have done it.\n\n For when Catiline was bent and determined, not only to\noverthrow the state of the commonwealth, but utterly to destroy\nthe Empire of Rome, he escaped out of the hands of justice for\nlack of sufficient proof, before his full treason and determination\nwas known. Notwithstanding, he left Lentulus and Cethegus in\nthe city, companions of his conspiracy: unto whom, whether\nCaesar did give any secret help or comfort, it is not well \nknown.\nYet this is manifest, that when they were \n\n                   in open\nSenate, Cicero being at that time Consul, asking every man's\nopinion in the Senate what punishment they should have, and\nevery one of them, till it came to Caesar, gave sentence they\nshould die: Caesar then rising up to speak, made an oration\n(penned and premeditated before) and said, that it was neither\nlawful, nor yet their custom did bear it, to put men of such\nnobility to death (but in an extremity) without lawful \n\n                  \nand condemnation. And therefore, that if they were put\nin prison in some city of Italy, where Cicero thought best,\nuntil that Catiline were overthrown, the Senate then might at\ntheir pleasure quickly \n\n                   therein, as might appear\nbest unto their wisdoms. This opinion was thought more gentle,\nand withal was uttered with such a \n\n                   good grace and\neloquence, that not only they which were to speak after him\ndid approve it: but such also as had spoken to the contrary\n\n\nbefore, revoked their opinion, and stuck to his, until it came\nto Cato and Catulus to speak. They both did sharply inveigh\nagainst him, but Cato chiefly: who in his oration made Caesar\nsuspected to be of the conspiracy, and stoutly spake against\nhim, insomuch that the offenders were put into the hands of\nthe officers to be put to death. Caesar coming out of the\nSenate, a company of young men which guarded Cicero for\nthe safety of his person, did set upon him with their swords\ndrawn. But some say, that Curio covered Caesar with his gown,\nand took him out of their hands. And Cicero self, when the\nyoung men looked upon him, beckoned with his head that they\nshould not kill him, either fearing the fury of the people, or\nelse that he thought it too shameful and wicked a part. But\nif that were true, I marvel why Cicero did not put it into his\nbook he wrote of his consulship. But certainly they blamed him\nafterwards, for that he took not the opportunity offered him\nagainst Caesar, only for overmuch fear of the people, that loved\nhim very dearly. For shortly after, when Caesar went into the\nSenate, to clear himself of certain presumptions and false accusations\nobjected against him, and being bitterly taunted among\nthem, the Senate keeping him longer than they were wont:\nthe people came about the council-house, and called out aloud\nfor him, bidding them let him out. Cato then, fearing the\ninsurrection of the poor needy persons, which were they that\nput all their hope in Caesar, and did also move the people to stir,\ndid persuade the Senate to make a \n\n                   distribution of corn\nunto them, for a month. This distribution did put the commonwealth\nto a new charge of five hundred and fifty \n\n                  . This\ncounsel quenched a present great fear, and did in happy time\nscatter and disperse abroad the best part of Caesar's force and\npower, at such time as he was made Praetor, and that for respect\nof his office he was most to be feared. Yet all the time he was\nofficer, he never sought any alteration in the commonwealth;\nbut \n\n                  , he himself had a great misfortune fell on his\nhouse, which was this.\n\n \n                  There was a young nobleman of the order of the Patricians,\ncalled Publius Clodius, who lacked neither wealth nor\neloquence; but otherwise as insolent and impudent a person as\nany was else in Rome. He became in love with Pompeia\nCaesar's wife, who misliked not withal: notwithstanding she\nwas so \n\n                  , and Aurelia (Caesar's mother) an\nhonest gentlewoman, had such an eye \n\n                   her, that these two\n\nlovers could not meet as they would, without great peril and\ndifficulty. The Romans do use to honour a goddess which they\ncall the good goddess, as the Grecians have her whom they call\nGynaecia, to wit, the goddess of women. Her, the Phrygians do\nclaim to be peculiar unto them, saying: that she is king Midas'\nmother. Howbeit the Romans hold opinion, that it is a nymph\nof the woods married unto the god Faunus. The Grecians, they\nsay also, that she was one of the mothers of the god Bacchus,\nwhom they dare not name. And for proof hereof, on her feastday,\nthe women make certain tabernacles of vine-twigs, and\nleaves of vine-branches; and also they make, as the tale goeth,\na holy dragon for this goddess, and do set it by her: besides, it\nis not lawful for any man to be present at their sacrifices, no,\nnot within the house itself where they are made. Furthermore\nthey say, that the women in these sacrifices do many things\namongst themselves, much like unto the ceremonies of Orpheus.\nNow when the time of this feast came, the husband (whether he\nwere Praetor or Consul) and all his men and the boys in the\nhouse, do come out of it, and leave it wholly to his wife, to \n\n                  \nthe house at her pleasure, and there the sacrifices and ceremonies\nare done the \n\n                   part of the night, and they do besides\npass the night away in songs and music. Pompeia, Caesar's\nwife, being that year to celebrate this feast, Clodius, who had\nyet no hair on his face, and thereby thought he should not\nbe \n\n                  , disguised himself in a singing wench's apparel,\nbecause his face was very like unto a young wench. He finding\nthe gates open, being secretly brought in by her chambermaid\nthat was made privy unto it, she left him, and ran to\nPompeia her mistress, to tell her that he was come. The\nchamber-maid tarried long before she came again, insomuch as\nClodius, being weary waiting for her where she left him, he\ntook his pleasure and went from one place to another in the\nhouse, which had very large rooms in it, still shunning the\nlight; and was by chance met \n\n                   by one of Aurelia's\nmaids, who taking him for a woman, prayed her to play.\nClodius refusing to play, the maid pulled him forward, and\nasked him what he was: Clodius then answered her, that he\ntarried for Abra, one of Pompeia's women. So Aurelia's maid,\nknowing him by his voice, ran straight where the lights and\nladies were, and cried out, that there was a man disguised in\nwoman's apparel. The women therewith were so amazed, that\nAurelia caused them \n\n                  to leave off the ceremonies of the\n\n\nsacrifice, and to hide their secret things; and having seen the\ngates fast locked, went immediately up and down the house with\ntorch-light to seek out this man: who at the last was found out\nin the chamber of Pompeia's maid, with whom he hid himself.\nThus Clodius being found out, and known of the women, they\nthrust him out of the doors by the shoulders. The same night\nthe women told their husbands of this chance as soon as they\ncame home. The next morning, there ran a great rumour\nthrough the city, how Clodius had attempted a great villany,\nand that he deserved not only to be punished of them whom\nhe had slandered, but also of the commonwealth and the gods.\nThere was one of the tribunes of the people that did \n\n                   him, \nand accuse him of high treason to the gods. Furthermore, there \nwere also of the chiefest of the nobility and Senate, that came to\ndepose against him, and burthened him with many horrible and\ndetestable facts, and specially with incest committed with his\nown sister, which was married unto Lucullus. Notwithstanding \nthe people stoutly defended Clodius against their accusations:\nand this did help him much against the judges, which were\namazed, and afraid to stir the people. This notwithstanding,\nCaesar presently put his wife away, and thereupon being brought\nby Clodius' accuser to be a witness against him, he answered,\nhe knew nothing \n\n                   that they objected against Clodius. This\nanswer being clean contrary to their expectation that heard it,\nthe accuser asked Caesar, why then he had put away his wife:\n\"Because I will not,\" said he, \"that my wife be so much as\nsuspected.\" And some say that Caesar spake truly as he\nthought. But others think that he did it to please the common\npeople, who were very desirous to save Clodius. So Clodius\nwas discharged of this accusation, because the most part of the\njudges gave a confused judgment, for the fear they stood in one\nway of the danger of the common people, if they condemned him,\nand for the ill opinion on the other side of the nobility, if they\ndid \n\n                   him.\n\n\n                  \n                  The government of the province of Spain being fallen\nunto Caesar, for that he was Praetor, his creditors came and cried\nout upon him, and were importunate of him to be paid. Caesar,\nbeing unable to satisfy them, was compelled to go unto Crassus,\nwho was the richest man of all Rome, and that stood in need of\nCaesar's boldness and courage to withstand Pompey's greatness\nin the commonwealth. Crassus became his surety unto his\ngreediest creditors for the sum of eight hundred and thirty\n\n\ntalents: whereupon they suffered Caesar to depart to the government\nof his province. In this journey it is reported, that passing\nover the mountains of the Alps, they came through a little poor\nvillage that had not many households, and yet poor cottages.\nThere his friends that did accompany him asked him merrily,\nif there were any contending for offices in that town, and whether\nthere were any strife there amongst the noblemen for honour.\nCaesar speaking in good earnest, answered: \"I cannot tell that,\"\nsaid he, \"but for my part I had rather be the chiefest man here\nthan the second person in Rome.\" Another time also when he\nwas in Spain, reading the history of Alexander's acts, when he\nhad read it, he was sorrowful a good while after, and then burst\nout in weeping. His friends seeing that, marvelled what should\nbe the cause of his sorrow. He answered them, \" Do ye not\nthink,\" said he, \" that I have good cause to be heavy, when king\nAlexander, being no \n\n                   than myself is now, had in old time\nwon so many nations and countries: and that I hitherunto have\ndone nothing worthy of myself?\" \n                  Therefore when he was come\ninto Spain, he was very careful of his business, and had in few\ndays joined ten new \n\n                   more of footmen unto the other\ntwenty which he had before. Then marching forward against\nthe Callecians and Lusitanians, he conquered all, and went as\nfar as the great sea Oceanum, subduing all the people which\nbefore knew not the Romans for their lords. There he took\n\n\n                   for pacifying of the war, and did as wisely take order for\nthe establishing of peace. For he did reconcile the cities together,\nand made them friends one with another, but specially he\npacified all suits of law and strife betwixt the debtors and creditors,\nwhich grew by reason of usury. For he ordained that\nthe creditors should take yearly two parts of the revenue of their\ndebtors, until such time as they had paid themselves: and that\nthe debtors should have the third part themselves to live\nwithal.\n\n \n                  He having won great estimation by this good order\ntaken, returned from his government very rich, and his soldiers\nalso full of rich spoils, who called him Imperator, \n\n                  , sovereign\nCaptain. Now the Romans having a custom, that such \nas\ndemanded honour of triumph should remain a while without\nthe city, and that they on the other side which sued for the\nConsulship should of necessity be there in person: Caesar\ncoming \n\n                   at the very time when the \nConsuls were\nchosen, he sent to pray the Senate to do him that \nfavour, that,\n\n\nbeing absent, he might by his friends sue for the Consulship.\nCato at the first did vehemently inveigh against it, \n\n                   an\nexpress law to the contrary. But afterwards, perceiving that\nnotwithstanding the reasons he alleged, many of the Senators\n(being won by Caesar) favoured his request, yet he cunningly\nsought all he could to prevent them, prolonging time, in dilating\nhis oration until night. Caesar thereupon determined rather to\ngive over the suit of his triumph, and to make suit for the\nConsulship: and so came into the city, and had such a device\nwith him, as went beyond them all but Cato only. His device\nwas this: Pompey and Crassus, two of the greatest personages\nof the city of Rome being at \n\n                   together, Caesar made them\nfriends, and by that means got unto himself the power of them\nboth, for \n\n                   of that gentle act and friendship of his, he\nsubtilly (unawares to them all) did greatly alter and change the\nstate of the commonwealth. For it was not the private discord\nbetween Pompey and Caesar, as many men thought, that caused\nthe civil war: but rather it was their agreement together, who\njoined all their powers first to overthrow the state of the Senate\nand nobility, and afterwards they fell at \n\n                   one with another.\nBut Cato, that then foresaw and prophecied many times what\nwould follow, was taken but for a vain man: but afterwards they\nfound him a wiser man than \n\n                   in his counsel.\n\n\n                   \n                  Thus Caesar, being brought unto the assembly of the\nelection, in the \n\n                   of these two noble persons whom he\nhad before reconciled together, he was there chosen Consul with\nCalphurnius Bibulus, without gainsaying or contradiction of;\nany man. Now when he was entered into his office, he began to\nput forth laws meeter for a seditious Tribune of the people than\nfor a Consul: because by them he preferred the division of \nlands, and distributing of corn to every citizen gratis, to please \nthem withal. But when the noblemen of the Senate were \nagainst his device, he, desiring no better \n\n                  , began to cry \nout and to protest, that by the overhardness and austerity of \nthe Senate, they \n\n                   him against his will to lean unto the\npeople: and thereupon, having Crassus on the one side of him\nand Pompey on the other, he asked them openly in the assembly,\nif they did give their consent unto the laws which he had\nput forth. They both answered, they did. Then he prayed\nthem to stand by him against those that threatened him with\nforce of sword to \n\n                   him. Crassus gave him his word, he,\nwould; Pompey also did the like, and added thereunto, that he\n\nwould come with his sword and \n\n                   both, against them that\nwould withstand him with their swords. These words offended\nmuch the Senate, being far unmeet for his gravity, and \n\n                  \nfor the majesty and honour he carried, and most of all\nuncomely for the presence of the Senate whom he should have\nreverenced: and were speeches fitter for a rash light-headed\nyouth, than for his person. Howbeit the common people on the\nother side, they rejoiced.\n\n \n                  Then Caesar, because he would be more assured of\nPompey's power and friendship, he gave him his daughter Julia\nin marriage, which was made sure before unto Servilius Caepio,\nand promised him in exchange Pompey's daughter, who was\n\n\n                   also unto Faustus, the son of Sylla. And shortly after\nalso, Caesar \n\n                   did marry Calphurnia, the daughter of Piso,\nwhom he caused to be made Consul, to succeed him the next\nyear following. Cato then cried out with open mouth, and\ncalled the gods to witness, that it was a shameful matter, and\nnot to be suffered, that they should in that sort make havoc of\nthe Empire of Rome, by such horrible bawdy matches, distributing\namong themselves, through those wicked marriages, the\ngovernments of the provinces, and of great armies. Calphurnius\nBibulus, fellow-Consul with Caesar, perceiving that he did\ncontend in vain, making all the resistance he could to withstand\nthis law, and that oftentimes he was in danger to be slain with\nCato in the market-place and assembly; he kept close in his\nhouse all the rest of his Consulship. When Pompey had married\nJulia, he filled all the market-place with soldiers, and by\nopen force authorized the laws which Caesar made in the behalf\nof the people. Furthermore, he procured that Caesar had Gaul\non this side and beyond the Alps, and all Illyria, with four\nlegions granted him for five years.\n\n \n                  Then Cato standing up to speak against it, Caesar bad\nhis officers lay hold on him, and carry him to prison, thinking\nhe would have appealed unto the Tribunes. But Cato said\nnever a word, when he went his way. Caesar perceiving then,\nthat not only the Senators and nobility were offended, but that\nthe common people also, for the reverence they bare unto Cato's\nvirtues, were ashamed, and went away with silence; he himself\nsecretly did pray one of the Tribunes that he would take Cato\nfrom the officers. But after he had played this part, there were\nfew Senators that would be President of the Senate under him,\nbut left the city, because they \n\n                   his doings.\n\nAnd of them there was an old man called Considius, that on a\ntime boldly told him, the rest durst not come to council because\nthey were afraid of his soldiers. Caesar answered him again:\n\"and why then dost not thou keep thee at home, for the same\nfear?\" Considius replied, \"because my age taketh away fear\nfrom me: for having so short a time to live, I have no care to\nprolong it further.\" The shamefullest part that Caesar played\nwhile he was Consul seemeth to be this: when he chose P. Clodius\nTribune of the people, that had offered his wife such dishonour,\nand profaned the holy ancient mysteries of the women,\nwhich were celebrated in his own house. Clodius sued to be\nTribune to no other end, but to destroy Cicero: and Caesar self \nalso departed not from Rome to his army before he had set\nthem together by the ears, and driven Cicero out of Italy.\n\n\n                  All these things they say he did before the wars with\nthe Gauls. But the time of the great armies and conquests he\nmade afterwards, and of the war in the which he subdued all the\nGauls (entering into another course of life far contrary unto the\nfirst) made him to be known for as valiant a soldier and as\nexcellent a captain to lead men, as those that afore him had\nbeen counted the wisest and most valiant generals that ever\nwere, and that by their valiant deeds had achieved great honour.\nFor whosoever would compare the house of the Fabians, of the\nScipios, of the Metellians, yea, those also of his own time, or\nlong before him, as Sylla, Marius, the two Lucullians, and\nPompey self:\n\n\n\nit will appear that Caesar's prowess and deeds of arms did excel\nthem all together. The \n\n                  , in the hard countries where he \nmade wars: \n\n                  , in enlarging the realms and countries\nwhich he joined unto the Empire of Rome: another, in the multitude\nand power of his enemies whom he overcame: another, in\nthe rudeness and austere nature of men with whom he had to do,\nwhose manners afterwards he softened and made civil: another, \nin courtesy and clemency which he used unto them whom he had \nconquered: another, in great bounty and liberality bestowed unto\nthem that served under him in those wars: and \n\n                  , he \nexcelled\nthem all in the number of battles he had fought, and in\nthe multitude of his enemies he had slain in battle. For in less \nthan ten years' war in Gaul he took by force and assault above \neight hundred towns: he conquered three hundred several nations:\nand having before him in battle thirty hundred thousand\n\nsoldiers, at sundry times, he slew ten hundred thousand of them,\nand took as many more prisoners. \n                  Furthermore, he was so\nentirely beloved of his soldiers, that to do him service (where\notherwise they were no more than other men in any private\nquarrel) if Caesar's honour were touched, they were invincible,\nand would so desperately venture themselves and with such\nfury, that no man was able to abide them.\n\n \n                  And this appeareth plainly by the example of Acilius:\nwho in a battle by sea before the city of Marseilles, \n\n                  \none of his enemies' ships, one cut off his right hand with a\nsword; but yet he forsook not his \n\n                   which he had in his\nleft hand, but thrust it in his enemies' faces, and made them fly,\nso that he \n\n                   their ship from them. And Cassius Scaeva also,\nin a conflict before the city of Dyrrachium, having one of his\neyes put out with an arrow, his shoulder stricken through with\na dart, and his thigh with another, and having received thirty\narrows upon his shield, he called to his enemies, and made as\nthough he would yield unto them. But when two of them came\nrunning to him, he crave one of their shoulders from his body\nwith his sword, and hurt the other in the face: so that he made\nhim turn his back, and at the length saved himself, by means of\nhis companions that came to help him. And in Britain also,\nwhen the captains of the bands were driven into a \n\n                   or\nbog full of mire and dirt, and that the enemies did fiercely assail\nthem there, Caesar then standing to view the battle, he saw a\nprivate soldier of his thrust in among the captains, and fought\nso valiantly in their defence, that at the length he \n\n                   the\nbarbarous people to fly, and by his means saved the captains,\nwhich otherwise were in great danger to have been cast \n\n                  .\nThen this soldier, being the hindmost man of all the captains,\nmarching with great pain through the mire and dirt, half swimming\nand half on foot, in the end got to the other side, but left\nhis shield behind him. Caesar, wondering at his noble courage,\nran to him with joy to embrace him. But the poor soldier\nhanging down his head, the water standing in his eyes, fell\ndown at Caesar's feet, and besought him to pardon him, for that\nhe had left his target behind him. And in Africa also, Scipio\nhaving taken one of Caesar's ships, and Granius Petronius\n\n\n                   on her amongst other, not long before chosen Treasurer;\nhe put all the rest to the sword but him, and said he would give\nhim his life. But Petronius answered him again, that Caesar's\nsoldiers did not use to have their lives given them, but to give\n\n\nothers their lives: and with these words he drew his sword, and\nthrust himself through.\n\n\n                   Now Caesar's self did breed this noble courage and life\nin them. First, for that he gave them bountifully, and did\nhonour them also, strewing thereby, that he did not heap up\nriches in the wars to maintain his life afterwards in wantonness\nand pleasure, but that he did keep it in store, honourably to\nreward their valiant service: and that by so much he thought\nhimself rich, by how much he was liberal in rewarding of them\nthat had deserved it. Furthermore, they did not wonder so much\nat his valiantness in putting himself at every instant in such\nmanifest danger, and in taking so extreme pains as he did,\nknowing that it was his greedy desire of honour that set him on\nfire, and pricked him forward to do it: but that he always continued\nall labour and \n\n                  , more than his body could bear,\nthat filled them all with admiration. For, concerning the constitution\nof his body, he was lean, white, and soft-skinned, \nand\noften subject to headache, and otherwhile to the falling \n\n                  \n(the which took him the first time, as it is reported, \nin Corduba,\na city of Spain :) but yet therefore yielded not to the\ndisease of his body, to make it a cloak to cherish him withal,\nbut contrarily, took the pains of war as a medicine to cure his\nsick body, fighting always with his disease, travelling continually,\nliving soberly, and commonly lying abroad in the field.\nFor the most nights he slept in his coach or litter, and thereby\nbestowed his rest, to make him always able to do something:\nand in the day-time he would travel up and down the country\nto see towns, castles, and strong places. He had always a\nsecretary with him in the coach, who did \n\n                   write as he went\nby the way, and a soldier behind him that carried his sword.\nHe made such speed the first time he came from Rome, when \nhe had his office, that in eight days he came to the River of\nRhone. He was so excellent a rider of horse from his youth,\nthat holding his hands behind him, he would gallop his horse\nupon the spur. In his wars in Gaul, he did further exercise\nhimself to indite letters as he rode by the way, and did \n\n                  \ntwo secretaries at once with as much as they could write: and,\nas Oppius writeth, more than two at a time. As it is reported,\nthat Caesar was the first that devised friends might talk together\nby writing cyphers in letters, when he had no leisure to speak\nwith them for his urgent business, and for the great distance\nbesides from Rome. How little account Caesar made of his\n\ndiet, this example cloth prove it. Caesar supping one night in\nMilan with his friend Valerius Leo, there was served \n\n                  \nto his board, and oil of perfume put into it instead of sallet\n                  .\nHe simply \n\n                   it, and found no fault, blaming his friends that\nwere offended: and told them, that it had been enough for them\nto have abstained to eat of that they misliked, and not to shame\ntheir friend, and how that he lacked good manners that found\nfault with his friend. Another time, as he travelled through the\ncountry, he was driven by foul weather on the sudden to take a\npoor man's cottage, that had but one little cabin in it, and that\nwas so narrow, that one man could but scarce lie in it. Then he\nsaid to his friends that were about him: \" Greatest rooms are\nmeetest for greatest men, and the most necessary rooms for the\nsickest persons.\" And thereupon he called Oppius that was\nsick to lie there all night: and he himself, with the rest of his\nfriends, lay without doors, under the \n\n                   of the house.\n\n\n                  The first war that Caesar made with the Gauls, was\nwith the Helvetians and Tigurinians, who having set fire \n\n                   all\ntheir good cities, to the number of twelve, and four hundred\nvillages besides, came to invade that part of Gaul which was\nsubject to the Romans, as the Cimbri and Teutons had done\nbefore, unto whom for valiantness they \n\n                  : and\nthey were also a great number of them (for they were three\nhundred thousand souls in all) whereof there were an hundred\nfour score and ten thousand fighting men. Of those, it was not\nCaesar himself that overcame the Tigurinians, but Labienus his\nlieutenant, that overthrew them by the river of Arax. But the\nHelvetians themselves came suddenly with their army to set\nupon him, as he was going towards a city of his confederates.\nCaesar perceiving that, made haste to get him some place of\nstrength, and there did set his men in battle \n\n                  . When one\nbrought him his horse to get upon, which he used in battle, he\nsaid unto them: \"When I have overcome mine enemies, I will\nthen get upon him to follow the chase, but now let us give them\ncharge.\" Therewith he marched forward on foot and gave\ncharge: and there fought it out a long t.me, before he could\nmake them fly that were in battle. But the greatest trouble he\nhad was to distress their camp, and to break their \n\n                  \nwhich they had made with their carts. For there, they that\nbefore had fled from the battle did not only put themselves in\nforce, and valiantly fought it out: but their wives and children\nalso, fighting for their lives to the death, were all slain, and the\n\nbattle was \n\n                   ended at midnight. Now if the act of this\nvictory was famous, unto that he also added another as notable,\nor exceeding it. For of all the barbarous people that had\nescaped from this battle, he gathered together again above an\nhundred thousand of them, and compelled them to return home\ninto their country which they had forsaken, and unto their\ntowns also which they had burnt: because he feared the Germans\nwould come over the river of \n\n                  , and occupy that\ncountry Iying void.\n\n\n                   \n                  The second war he made, was in defence of the Gauls\nagainst the Germans: although before he himself had caused\nAriovistius their king to be received for a confederate of the\nRomans. Notwithstanding, they were grown very unquiet\nneighbours, and it appeared plainly, that, having any occasion\noffered them to enlarge their territories, they would not content\nthem with their own, but meant to invade and possess the rest\nof Gaul. Caesar perceiving that some of his captains trembled\nfor fear, but specially the young gentlemen of noble houses of\nRome, who \n\n                   to have gone to the wars with him as only\nfor their pleasure and gain, he called them to council, and commanded\nthem that were afraid that they should depart home\nand not put themselves in danger against their wills, \n\n                   they\nhad such womanish faint hearts, to shrink when he had need of\nthem. And for himself, he said, he would set upon the barbarous\npeople, though he had left him but the tenth legion only\nsaying that the enemies were no valianter than the Cimbri had\nbeen, nor that he was a captain inferior unto Marius. This\noration being made, the soldiers of the tenth legion sent their\nlieutenants unto him, to thank him for the good opinion he had\nof them: and the other legions also \n\n                   with their captains\nand all of them together followed him many days' journey with\ngood will to serve him, until they came within two hundred\nfurlongs of the camp of the enemies. Ariovistus' courage was\nwell cooled, when he saw Caesar was come, and that the\nRomans came to seek out the Germans; \n\n                   they thought\nand made account, that they durst not have \n\n                   them\nand therefore, \n\n                   mistrusting it would have come so to\npass, he wondered much at Caesar's courage, and the more\nwhen he saw his own army in a \n\n                   withal. But much more\ndid their courage fall, by reason of the foolish women-prophesiers\nthey had amongst them, which did foretell things to come:\nwho, considering the waves and trouble of the rivers, and the\n\n\nterrible noise they made running down the stream, did forewarn\nthem not to fight until the new moon. Caesar having intelligence\nthereof, and perceiving that the barbarous people thereupon\nstirred not, thought it best then to set upon them, being\ndiscouraged with this superstitious fear, rather than, losing time,\nhe should tarry their leisure. So he did skirmish with them\neven to their forts and little hills where they lay, and by this\nmeans provoked them so, that with great fury they came down\nto fight. There he overcame them in battle, and followed them\nin chase, with great slaughter, three hundred furlongs, even\nunto the river of Rheyn: and he filled all the fields \"hitherto\nwith dead bodies and spoils. Howbeit Ariovistus, flying with\nspeed, got over the river of Rheyn, and escaped with a few of\nhis men. It is said that there were slain fourscore thousand\npersons at this battle.\n\n\n                   After this exploit, Caesar left his army amongst the\nSequanes to winter there: and he himself in the meantime,\nthinking of the affairs at Rome, went over the mountains into\nGaul about the river of Po, being part of his province which he\nhad in charge. For there the river called Rubico divideth the\nrest of Italy from Gaul on this side of the Alps. Caesar Iying\nthere, did \n\n                   to make friends in Rome, because many\ncame thither to see him: unto whom he granted their suits they\ndemanded, and sent them home also, partly with liberal rewards,\nand partly with large promises and hope. Now during\nall this conquest of the Gauls, Pompey did not consider how\nCaesar \n\n                   did conquer the Gauls with the weapons\nof the Romans, and \n\n                   the Romans again with the money of\nthe Gauls. Caesar, being \n\n                   that the Belgae (which\nwere the \n\n                   men of all the Gauls, and that occupied the\nthird part of Gaul) were all up in arms, and had raised a great\n\n                  \nof men together: he straight made towards them with\nall possible speed, and found them spoiling and overrunning the\ncountry of the Gauls, their neighbours, and confederates of the\nRomans. So he gave them battle, and they fighting cowardly,\nhe overthrew the most part of them, which were in a \n\n                  \ntogether; and slew such a number of them, that the Romans\npassed over deep rivers and lakes on foot, upon their dead\nbodies, the rivers were so full of them.\n\n After this overthrow, they that dwelt nearest unto the\nseaside, and were next neighbours unto the Ocean, did yield\nthemselves without any compulsion or fight: whereupon he led\n\nhis army against the Nervians, the stoutest warriors of all the\nBelgae. They, dwelling in the wood country, had conveyed their\nwives, children, and goods into a marvellous great forest, as far\nfrom their enemies as they could; and being about the number\nof six score thousand fighting men and more, they came one\nday and set upon Caesar, when his army was out of order, and\nfortifying of his camp, little \n\n                   to have fought that day.\nAt the first charge, they \n\n                   the horsemen of the Romans,\nand compassing in the twelfth and seventh legion, they slew\nall the centurions and captains of the bands. And had not\nCaesar \n\n                   taken his shield on his arm, and, flying in amongst\nthe barbarous people, made a lane through them that fought\nbefore him: and the tenth legion also, seeing him in danger,\nrun unto him from the top of the hill where they stood in\nbattle, and broken the ranks of their enemies, there had not\na Roman escaped alive that day. But taking example of\nCaesar's valiantness, they fought desperately beyond their power,\nand yet could not make the Nervians fly, but they fought it out\nto the death, till they were all \n\n                   slain in the field. It\nis written that of threescore thousand fighting men, there escaped\nonly but five hundred: and of four hundred gentlemen and\ncounsellors of the Romans, but three saved. The Senate understanding\nit at Rome, ordained that they should do sacrifice unto\nthe gods, and keep feasts and solemn processions fifteen days\ntogether without intermission, having never made the like ordinance\nat Rome for any victory that ever was obtained: because\nthey saw the danger had been marvellous great, so many nations\nrising as they did in arms together against him: and further, the\nlove of the people unto him made his victory much more\nfamous.\n\n For when Caesar had set his affairs \n\n                   in Gaul,\non the other side of the Alps, he always used to lie about\nthe river of Po in the winter time, to give direction for the\nestablishing of things at Rome at his pleasure. For not only\nthey that made suit for offices at Rome were chosen Magistrates,\nby means of Caesar's money which he gave them, with\nthe which, bribing the people, they bought their voices, and\nwhen they were in office did all that they could to increase\nCaesar's power and greatness: but the greatest and chiefest\nmen also of the nobility went into Lucca unto him; \n\n                  \nPompey, Crassus, Appius, Praetor of Sardinia, and Nepos\nProconsul in Spain. Insomuch that there were at one time\n\nsixscore sergeants carrying rods and axes before the Magistrates:\nand above two hundred Senators besides. There they fell in\nconsultation, and determined that Pompey and Crassus should\nagain be chosen Consuls the next year following. Furthermore\nthey did appoint, that Caesar should have money again\ndelivered him to pay his army; and besides, did prorogue the\ntime of his government five years further. This was thought\na very strange and an unreasonable matter unto wise men;\nfor they themselves that had taken so much money of Caesar,\npersuaded the Senate to let him have money of the common\ntreasure, as though he had had none before: yea, to speak\nmore plainly, they compelled the Senate unto it, sighing and\nlamenting to see the decrees they passed. Cato was not there\nthen, for they had purposely sent him before into Cyprus.\nHowbeit Faonius, that followed Cato's steps, when he saw that\nhe could not prevail nor withstand them, he went out of the\nSenate in choler, and cried out amongst the people that it\nwas a horrible shame. But no man did hearken to him: some\nfor the reverence they bare unto Pompey and Crassus; and\nothers, favouring Caesar s proceedings, did put all their hope\nand trust in him: and therefore did quiet themselves, and\nstirred not.\n\n\n                  Then Caesar, returning into Gaul beyond the Alps unto\nhis army, found there a great war in the country. For two\ngreat nations of Germany had not long before passed over\nthe river of \n\n                  , to conquer new lands: and the one of\nthese people were called Ipes, and the other Tenterides. Now\ntouching the battle which Caesar fought with them, he himself\ndoth describe it in his Commentaries, in this sort. That\nthe barbarous people having sent ambassadors unto him to\n\n                  \npeace for a certain time, they notwithstanding, against\nthe law of arms, came and set upon him as he travelled by the\nway, insomuch as eight hundred of their men of arms overthrew\nfive thousand of his horsemen, who \n\n                  \ntheir coming. Again, that they sent him other ambassadors to\nmock him once more: but that he kept them, and \n\n                  \ncaused his whole army to march against them, thinking it a\nfolly and madness to keep faith with such traitorous barbarous\nbreakers of leagues. Canutius writeth, that the Senate appointing\nagain to do new sacrifice, processions, and feasts, to give\nthanks to the gods for this victory, Cato was of contrary opinion,\nthat Caesar should be delivered into the hands of the barbarous\n\npeople, for to purge their city and commonwealth of this breach\nof faith, and to turn the curse upon him that was the author\nof it. Of these barbarous people, which came over the \n\n                  \n(being about the number of four hundred thousand persons)\nthey were all \n\n                   slain, saving a very few of them,\nthat flying from the battle got over the river of Rheyn again,\nwho were received by the Sicambrians, another people of the\nGermans.\n\n Caesar taking this occasion against them, lacking no\ngoodwill of himself besides, to have the honour to be counted\nthe first Roman that ever passed over the river of Rheyn with an\narmy, he built a bridge over it. This river is marvellous broad,\nand runneth with great fury; and in that place specially where\nhe built his bridge, for there it is of a great breadth from\none side to the other: and it hath so strong and swift a stream\nbesides, that men casting down great bodies of trees into the\nriver (which the stream bringeth down with it) did with the\ngreat blows and force thereof marvellously shake the posts of\nthe bridge he had set up. But to prevent the blows of those\ntrees, and also to break the fury of the stream, he made a\npile of great wood above the bridge a good way, and did\nforcibly ram them into the bottom of the river; so that in ten\ndays space he had set up and finished his bridge of the goodliest\ncarpenters' work, and most excellent invention \n\n                  ,\nthat could be possibly thought or devised. Then, \n\n                  \nover his army upon it, he found none that durst any more\nfight with him. For the Suevians, which were the warlikest\npeople of all Germany, had gotten themselves with their goods\ninto \n\n                   great valleys and bogs, full of woods and\nforests. Now when he had burnt all the country of his enemies,\nand confirmed a league with the confederates of the Romans, he\nreturned back again into Gaul after he had tarried eighteen\ndays at the most in Germany, on the other side of the Rheyn.\n\n \n                  The journey he made also into England was a noble\nenterprise and very commendable. For he was the first that\nsailed the West Ocean with an army by sea, and that passed\nthrough the sea Atlanticum with his army, to make war in that\nso great and famous \n\n                   (which many ancient writers would\nnot believe that it was so indeed, and did make them vary about\nit, saying it was but a fable and a lie), and was the first that enlarged\nthe Roman Empire beyond the earth \n\n                  . For\ntwice he passed over the narrow sea \n\n                   the firm land of\n\nGaul, and fighting many battles there, did hurt his enemies\nmore than \n\n                   his own men: because, \n\n                   men hardly\nbrought up and poor there was nothing to be gotten. Whereupon\nthe war had no such success as he looked for, and therefore,\ntaking pledges only of the King, and imposing a yearly\ntribute upon him, to be paid unto the people of Rome, he\nreturned again into Gaul. There he was no sooner landed, but\nhe found letters ready to be sent over the sea unto him: in the\nwhich he was \n\n                   from Rome of the death of his daughter,\nthat she was dead with child by Pompey. For the which Pompey\nand Caesar both were marvellous sorrowful: and their friends\nmourned also, thinking that this alliance which maintained\nthe commonwealth (that otherwise was very \n\n                  ) in good\npeace and concord, was now severed and broken asunder;\nand the \n\n                   likely, because the child lived not long after\nthe mother. So the common people at Rome took the corpse\nof Julia, in despite of the Tribunes, and buried it in the field\nof Mars.\n\n\n                   \n                  Now Caesar, being driven to divide his army (that\nwas very great) in sundry garrisons for the winter-time, and\nreturning again into Italy as he was wont, all Gaul rebelled\nagain, and had raised great armies in every quarter to set\nupon the Romans, and to \n\n                   if they could distress their\nforts where they lay in garrison. The greatest number and\nmost warlike men of these Gauls that entered into action of\nrebellion, were led by one Ambiorix: and first did set upon\nthe garrisons of Cotta and Titurius, whom they slew, and\nall the soldiers they had about them. Then they went with\nthreescore thousand fighting men to besiege the garrisons which\nQuintus Cicero had in his charge, and had almost taken them\nby force, because all the soldiers were every man of them hurt:\nbut they were so valiant and courageous, that they did more\nthan men (as they say) in defending of themselves. These\nnews being come to Caesar, who was far from thence at that\ntime, he returned with all possible speed, and leaving seven\nthousand soldiers, made haste to help Cicero that was in such\ndistress. The Gauls that did besiege Cicero, understanding of\nCaesar's coming, raised their siege \n\n                  , to go and\nmeet him: making account that he was but a handful in their\nhands, they were so few. Caesar, to deceive them, still drew\nback, and made as though he fled from them, lodging in places\nmeet for a captain that had but a few to fight with a great\n\n\nnumber of his enemies; and commanded his men in no wise to\nstir out to skirmish with them, but compelled them to raise up\nthe \n\n                   of his camp, and to fortify the gates as men that\nwere afraid, \n\n                   the enemies should the less esteem of \nthem: until at length he took opportunity by their disorderly \ncoming to assail the trenches of his camp, (they were grown to\nsuch a presumptuous boldness and bravery,) and then, sallying \nout upon them, he put them all to flight with slaughter of a great \nnumber of them. This did suppress all the rebellions of the \nGauls in those parts, and furthermore he himself in person\nwent in the midst of winter thither, where he heard they did \nrebel: for that there was come a new supply out of Italy of \nthree whole legions, \n\n                   which he had lost: of the \nwhich, two of them Pompey lent him, and the other legion he \nhimself had levied in Gaul about the river Po. During these \nstirs, \n\n                   forth the beginning of the greatest and most\ndangerous war that he had in all Gaul, the which had been\nsecretly \n\n                   of long time by the chiefest and most warlike\npeople of that country, who had levied a wonderful great\npower. For everywhere they levied multitudes of men, and\ngreat riches besides, to fortify their strongholds. Furthermore\nthe country where they rose was very \n\n                  , and\nspecially at that time, being winter; when the rivers were frozen,\nthe woods and forests covered with snow, the meadows drowned \nwith floods, and the fields so deep of snow that no ways were to \nbe found, neither the \n\n                   nor rivers to be discerned, all \nwas so \n\n                   and drowned with water: all which troubles\ntogether were enough (as they thought) to keep Caesar from\nsetting upon the rebels. Many nations of the Gauls were of\nthis conspiracy, but two of the chiefest were the Avernians and\nCarnutes: who had chosen Vercingentorix for their lieutenant-general,\nwhose father the Gauls before had put to death, because\nthey thought he aspired to make himself king. This\nVercingentorix, dividing his army into divers parts, and appointing\ndivers captains over them, had gotten to take his part all\nthe people and countries thereabouts, even as far as they that\ndwell towards the \n\n                  , having further determined\n(understanding that Rome did conspire against Caesar)to make\nall Gaul rise in arms against him. So that if he had but tarried \na little longer, until Caesar had entered into his civil wars, he \nhad put all Italy in as great fear and danger as it was when the\nCimbri did come and invade it. But Caesar, that was valiant\n\n\nin all \n\n                   and dangers of war, and that was very skilful to\ntake time and opportunity, so soon as he understood the news\nof this rebellion, he departed with speed and returned back the\nself-same way which he had gone, making the barbarous people\nknow that they should deal with an army invincible, and\nwhich they could not possibly withstand, considering the great\nspeed he had made with the same in so sharp and hard a winter.\nFor where they would not possibly have believed that a \n\n                  \nor \n\n                   could have come in so short a time from the place\nwhere he was unto them, they wondered when they saw him\nburning and destroying the country, the towns, and strong forts,\nwhere he came with his army, taking all to mercy that yielded\nunto him: until such times as the Hedui took arms against\nhim, who before were wont to be called the brethren of the\nRomans, and were greatly honoured of them. Wherefore\nCaesar's men, when they understood that they had joined with\nthe rebels, they were marvellous \n\n                  , and half discouraged.\nThereupon Caesar, departing from those parts, went through the\ncountry of the Lingones to enter the country of the \n\n                  ,\nwho were confederates of the Romans, and the nearest unto\nItaly on that side, in respect of all the rest of Gaul. Thither\nthe enemies came to set upon him and to environ him on all\nsides, with an infinite number of thousands of fighting men.\nCaesar on the other side tarried their coming, and fighting with\nthem a long time, he made them so afraid of him, that at length\nhe overcame the barbarous people. But at the first, it seemeth\nnotwithstanding, that he had received some overthrow: for the\nArvernians shewed a sword hanged up in one of their temples,\nwhich they said they had won from Caesar. Insomuch as\nCaesar \n\n                   coming that way by occasion, saw it, and fell alaughing\nat it. But some of his friends going \n\n                   to take it\naway, he would not suffer them, but bad them let it alone and\ntouch it not, for it was an holy thing.\n\n\n                   Notwithstanding, such as at the first had saved themselves\nby flying, the most part of them were gotten with their\nking into the city of Alexia, the which Caesar went and besieged,\nalthough it seemed \n\n                  , both for the height of the\nwalls as also for the multitude of soldiers they had to defend it.\nBut now, during this siege, he fell into a marvellous great danger\n\n\n                  , almost incredible. For an army of three hundred\nthousand fighting men, of the best men that were among all the\nlegions of the Gauls, came against him being at the siege of\n\n\nAlexia, besides them that were within the city, which amounted\nto the number of threescore and ten thousand fighting men at \nthe least: so that perceiving he was shut in betwixt two so \ngreat armies, he was driven to fortify himself with two walls, \nthe one against them of the city, and the other against them \n\n\n                  . For if those two armies had joined together, Caesar\nhad been utterly undone. And therefore, this siege of Alexia, \nand the battle he \n\n                   before it, did deservedly win him more\nhonour and fame than any other. For there, in that \n\n                  \nand extreme danger, he shewed more valiantness and wisdom\nthan he did in any battle he fought before. But what a wonderful\nthing was this! that they of the city never heard anything\nof them that came to aid them until Caesar had overcome them\nand furthermore, that the Romans themselves, which kept watch\nupon the wall that was built against the city, knew also no more\nof it than they, until it was done, and that they heard the cries\nand lamentations of men and women in Alexia, when they perceived\non the other side of the city such a number of \n\n                  \nshields of gold and silver, such store of bloody corslets and\narmours, such a deal of plate and moveables, and such a number\nof tents and pavilions after the fashion of the Gauls, which the\nRomans had gotten of their spoils in their camp! Thus suddenly\nwas this great army vanished, as a dream or vision:\nwhere the most part of them were slain that day in battle\nFurthermore, after that they within the city of Alexia had done\ngreat hurt to Caesar and themselves also, in the end they all\nyielded themselves. And Vercingentorix (he that was their king\nand captain in all this war) went out of the gates excellently well\narmed, and his horse \n\n                   with rich caparison accordingly,\nand rode round about Caesar, who sat in his chair of estate.\nThen lighting from his horse, he took off his caparison and\n\n\n                  , and unarmed himself, and laid all on the ground, and\nwent and sat down at Caesar's feet, and said never a word. So\nCaesar at length committed him as a prisoner taken in the wars,\nto lead him afterwards in the triumph at Rome.\n\n\n                   Now Caesar had of long time determined to destroy\nPompey, and Pompey him also. For Crassus being killed\namongst the Parthians, who only did see that one of them two\nmust needs fall, nothing kept Caesar from being the greatest\nperson, but because he destroyed not Pompey, that was the\ngreater: neither did anything \n\n                   Pompey to withstand that it\nshould not come to pass, but because he did not first overcome\n\n                  Caesar, whom only he feared. For till then, Pompey had not\nlong feared him, but always before \n\n                   him, thinking it\nan easy matter for him to put him down when he would, \n\n                  \nhe had brought him to that greatness he was come unto. But\nCaesar contrarily, having had that drift in his head from the beginning,\nlike a wrestler that studieth for tricks to overthrow his\nadversary, he went far from Rome, to exercise himself in the\nwars of Gaul; where he did train his army, and \n\n                  \nby his valiant deeds did increase his fame and honour. By these\nmeans became Caesar as famous as Pompey in his doings, and\nlacked no more to put his enterprise in execution, but some\noccasions of \n\n                  , which Pompey partly gave him, and partly\nalso the time delivered him, but chiefly, the hard fortune and ill\ngovernment at that time of the commonwealth at Rome. For\nthey that made suit for honour and offices bought the voices of\nthe people with ready money, which they gave out openly to\nusury, without shame or fear. Thereupon the common people\nthat had sold their voices for money, came to the market-place\nat the day of election, to fight for him that had hired them: not\nwith their voices, but with their bows, slings, and swords. So\nthat the assembly seldom times brake up, but the pulpit for\norations was defiled and sprinkled with the blood of them that\nwere slain in the market-place, the city remaining all that time\nwithout government of magistrate, like a ship left without a\npilot. Insomuch as men of deep judgment and discretion, seeing\nsuch fury and madness of the people, thought themselves\nhappy if the commonwealth were no worse troubled than with\nthe absolute state of a monarchy and sovereign lord to govern\nthem. Furthermore, there were many that were not afraid to\nspeak it openly, that there was no other help to remedy the\ntroubles of the commonwealth, but by the authority of one man\nonly, that should command them all: and that this medicine\nmust be ministered by the hands of him that was the gentlest\nphysician, meaning covertly Pompey. Now Pompey used many\nfine speeches, making semblance as though he would none of it,\nand yet cunningly underhand did lay all the irons in the fire he\ncould, to bring it to pass that he might be chosen Dictator.\nCato finding the mark he shot at, and fearing lest in the end the\npeople should be compelled to make him Dictator, he persuaded\nthe Senate rather to make him sole Consul, that, contenting\nhimself with that more just and lawful government, he should\nnot covet the other unlawful. The Senate, following his counsel,\n\ndid not only make him Consul, but further did \n\n                   his\ngovernment of the provinces he had. For he had two provinces,\nall Spain and Africk, the which he governed by his lieutenants:\nand further, he received yearly of the common treasure, to pay\nhis soldiers, a thousand talents. \n                  Hereupon Caesar took occasion\nalso to send his men to make suit in his name for the consulship,\nand also to have the government of his provinces \nprorogued.\nPompey at the first held his peace; but Marcellus and Lentulus\n(that otherwise hated Caesar) withstood them, and, to shame and\ndishonour him, had much needless speech in matters of weight.\nFurthermore they took away the freedom from the colonies which\nCaesar had lately brought unto the city of Novumcomum in\nGaul towards Italy, where Caesar not long before had lodged\nthem. And moreover, when Marcellus was Consul, he made\none of the senators in that city to be whipped with rods, who\ncame to Rome about those matters: and said, he gave him\nthose marks, that he should know he was no Roman citizen, and\nbade him go his way, and tell Caesar of it.\n\n \n                  After Marcellus' consulship, Caesar, setting open his\ncoffers of the treasure he had gotten among the Gauls, did\nfrankly give it out amongst the magistrates at Rome, without\nrestraint or spare. First, he set Curio the tribune clear out of\ndebt: and gave also unto Paul the Consul a thousand five hundred\ntalents, with which money he built that notable palace by\nthe market-place, called Paul's Basilick, in the place of Fulvius'\nBasilick. Then Pompey, being afraid of this \n\n                  , began\nopenly to procure, both by himself and his friends, that they\nshould send Caesar a successor: and moreover, he sent unto\nCaesar for his two legions of men of war, which he had lent\nhim for the conquest of Gaul. Caesar sent him them again,\nand gave every private soldier two hundred and fifty silver\ndrachmas. Now, they that brought these two legions back\nfrom Caesar, gave out ill and seditious words against him among\nthe people, and did also abuse Pompey with false persuasions\nand vain hopes, informing him that he was marvellously desired\nand wished for in Caesar's camp: and though in Rome,\nfor the malice and secret spite which the governors there did\nbear him, he could hardly obtain that he desired, yet in Gaul\nhe might assure himself, that all the army was at his commandment.\nThey added further also, that if the soldiers there did\nonce return over the mountains again into Italy, they would\nall straight come to him, they did so hate Caesar, because he\n\nwearied them with too much labour and continual fight: and\nwithal, for that they suspected he aspired to be king. These\nwords breeding security in Pompey, and a vain conceit of himself,\nmade him negligent in his doings, so that he made no\npreparation of war, as though he had no occasion to be afraid:\nbut only studied to thwart Caesar in speech, and to \n\n                   the\nsuits he made. Howbeit Caesar \n\n                   all this. For\nthe report went, that one of Caesar's captains which was sent\nto Rome to prosecute his suit, being at the Senate-door, and\nhearing that they denied to prorogue Caesar's time of government\nwhich he sued for, clapping his hand upon his sword, he\nsaid: \" \n\n                   you will not grant it him, this shall give it him.\"\nNotwithstanding, the requests that Caesar propounded carried\ngreat semblance of reason with them. For he said, that he was\ncontented to lay down arms, so that Pompey did the like: and\nthat both of them, as private persons, should come and make\nsuit of their citizens to obtain honourable recompence: declaring\nunto them that, taking arms from him, and granting\nthem unto Pompey, they did wrongfully accuse him \n\n                   going\nabout to make himself a tyrant, and in the mean time to grant\nthe other means to be a tyrant. Curio making these offers and\npersuasions openly before the people in the name of Caesar, he\nwas heard with great rejoicing and clapping of hands, and there\nwere some that cast flowers and nosegays upon him when he\nwent his way, as they commonly use to do unto any man, when\nhe hath obtained victory and won the games. Then Antonius,\none of the tribunes, brought a letter sent from Caesar, and\n\n\n                   it openly to be read in despite of the Consuls. But\nScipio in the Senate, Pompey's father-in-law, made this motion:\nthat if Caesar did not dismiss his army by a certain day appointed\nhim, the Romans should proclaim him an enemy unto\nRome. Then the Consuls openly asked in the presence of the\nsenators, if they thought it good that Pompey should dismiss\nhis army: but few agreed to that demand. After that again\nthey asked, if they liked that Caesar should dismiss his army:\nthereto they all \n\n                   answered, \"Yea, yea.\" But when\nAntonius requested again that both of them should lay down\narms, then they were all \n\n                   of his mind. Notwithstanding,\nbecause Scipio did insolently behave himself, and\nMarcellus also, who cried, that they must use force of arms and\nnot men's opinion against a thief, the Senate rose straight upon\nit without further determination; and men changed apparel\n\n\nthrough the city because of this dissension, as they \n\n                   to do\nin a common calamity. After that, there came other letters\nfrom Caesar, which seemed much more reasonable: in the\nwhich he requested that they would grant him Gaul that\nlieth between the mountains of the Alps and Italy and Illyria,\nwith two legions only, and then that he would request nothing\nelse; until he made suit for the second Consulship. Cicero the\norator, that was newly come from the government of Cilicia,\ntravailed to reconcile them together, and pacified Pompey the\nbest he could: who told him he would yield to anything he\nwould have him, so he did let him alone with his army. So\nCicero persuaded Caesar's friends to be contented, to take those\ntwo provinces, and six thousand men only, that they might be\nfriends and at peace together. Pompey very willingly yielded\nunto it, and granted them. But Lentulus the Consul would not\nagree to it, but shamefully \n\n                   Curio and Antonius out of the\nSenate: whereby they themselves gave Caesar a happy \n\n                  \nand \n\n                   as could be, stirring up his soldiers the more\nagainst them, when he shewed them these two noblemen and\ntribunes of the people, that were driven to fly, disguised like\nslaves, in a carrier's cart. For they were driven for fear to steal\nout of Rome, disguised in that manner. Now at that time\nCaesar had not in all about him above five thousand footmen\nand three thousand horsemen: for the rest of his army he left\non the other side of the mountains, to be brought after him by\nhis lieutenants. So, considering that, for the execution of his\nenterprise, he should not need so many men of war at the first\nbut rather, suddenly stealing upon them, to make them afraid\nwith valiantness, taking benefit of the opportunity of time; because\nhe should more easily make his enemies afraid of him\ncoming so suddenly when they looked not for him, than he\nshould otherwise distress them, assailing them with his whole\narmy, in giving them leisure to provide further for him: he\ncommanded his captains and lieutenants to go before, without\nany other armour than their swords, to take the city of Ariminum\n(a great city of Gaul, being the first city men come to,\nwhen they come out of Gaul) with as little bloodshed and tumult\nas they could possible. Then, committing that force and\narmy he had with him unto Hortensius, one of his friends, he\nremained a whole day together, openly in the sight of every\nman, to see the sword-players handle their weapons before him\nAt night he went into his lodging, and, bathing his body a \n\n\nlittle, came afterwards into the hall amongst them, and made\nmerry a while with them whom he had bidden to supper. Then,\nwhen it was well forward night, and very dark, he rose from the\ntable, and prayed his company to be merry, and no man to stir,\nfor he would straight come to them again: howbeit he had\nsecretly before commanded a few of his trustiest friends to follow\nhim; not \n\n                  , but some one way, and some another\nway. He himself in the mean time took a coach he had hired,\nand made as though he would have gone some other way at the\nfirst, but suddenly he turned back again towards the city of\nAriminum.\n\n \n                  When he was come unto the little river of Rubicon,\nwhich divided Gaul on this side the Alps from Italy, he \n\n                  \nupon a sudden. For, the nearer he came to execute his purpose,\nthe more remorse he had in his conscience, to think what\nan enterprise he took in hand: and his thoughts also fell out\nmore doubtful, when he entered into consideration of the desperateness\nof his attempt. So he fell into many thoughts with\nhimself, and spake never a word, \n\n                   sometime one way,\nsometime another way, and oftentimes changed his determination,\ncontrary to himself. So did he talk much also with his\nfriends he had with him, amongst whom was Asinius Pollio,\ntelling him what mischiefs the beginning of this passage over\nthat river would breed in the world, and how much their posterity,\nand they that lived after them, would speak of it in time\nto come. But at length, casting from him with a noble courage\nall those perilous thoughts to come, and speaking \n\n                  .\n\nwhich valiant men commonly say, that attempt dangerous and\ndesperate enterprises : \"A man can be but once undone; come\non,\" he passed over the river; and when he was come over, he\nran with his coach and never stayed, so that before daylight\nhe was within the city of Ariminum, and took it ... .... \n                  The city\nof Ariminum being taken, and the rumour thereof dispersed\nthrough all Italy even as if it had been open war both by sea\nand land, and as if all the laws of Rome, together with the extreme\nbounds and confines of the same, had been broken up: a\nman would have said, that not only the men and women for fear,\nas experience proved at other times, but whole cities themselves,\nleaving their habitations, fled from one place to another through\nall Italy. And Rome itself also was immediately filled with the\nflowing repair of all the people their neighbours thereabouts,\nwhich came thither from all parts like droves of cattle, that\n\n\nthere was neither officer nor magistrate that could any more\ncommand them by authority, neither by any persuasion of\nreason bridle such a confused and disorderly multitude: so that\nRome had \n\n                    destroyed itself for lack of rule end order.\nFor in all places men were of contrary opinions, and there were\ndangerous stirs and tumults everywhere, because they that\nwere glad of this trouble could keep in no certain place; but,\nrunning up and down the city, when they met with others in\ndivers places that seemed either to be afraid or angry with this\ntumult (as otherwise it is impossible in so great a city) they\nflatly fell out with them, and boldly threatened them with that\nthat was to come. Pompey himself, who at that time was not\na little amazed, was yet much more troubled with the ill words\nsome gave him on the one side, and some on the other. For\nsome of them reproved him, and said, that he had done\nwisely, and had paid for his folly, because he had made\nCaesar so great and strong against him and the commonwealth.\nAnd other again did blame him, because he had refused the\nhonest offers and reasonable conditions of peace which Caesar\nhad offered him, suffering Lentulus the Consul to abuse him toe\nmuch. On the other side, Phaonius spake unto him, and bade\nhim stamp on the ground with his foot: for Pompey being one\nday in a \n\n                   in the Senate, said openly: \" Let no man \n\n\n                   for preparation of war; for when he listed, with one\nstamp of his foot on the ground, he would fill all Italy with\nsoldiers.\" This notwithstanding, Pompey at that time had a\ngreater number of soldiers \n\n                   Caesar: but they would never\nlet him follow his own determination. For they brought him so\nmany lies, and put so many examples of fear before him, as if\nCaesar had been already at their heels, and had won all: so that\nin the end he yielded unto them, and gave place to their fury\nand madness, determining (seeing all things in such tumult and\n\n\n                   that there was no way but to forsake the city; and \nthereupon commanded the Senate to follow him, and not a man \nto tarry there, unless he loved tyranny more than his own liberty\nand the commonwealth. Thus the Consuls themselves, before\nthey had done their common sacrifices \n\n                   at their\ngoing out of the city, fled every man of them. So did likewise \nthe most part of the senators, taking their own things in haste\nsuch as came first to hand, as if by stealth they had taken them\nfrom another. And there were some of them also that always\nloved Caesar, whose wits were then so troubled and \n\n                  \n                  \n\nthemselves with the fear they had conceived, that they also fled,\nand followed the stream of this tumult, without manifest cause\nor necessity. But above all things it was a lamentable sight to\nsee the city itself, that in this fear and trouble was left at all\nadventure, as a ship tossed in storm of sea, forsaken \n\n                   her\npilots and despairing of her safety. This their departure being\nthus miserable, yet men esteemed their banishment (for the love\nthey bare unto Pompey) to be their natural country, and\nreckoned Rome no better than Caesar's camp. At that time\nalso Labienus, who was one of Caesar's greatest friends, and\nhad been always used as his lieutenant in the wars of Gaul,\nand had valiantly fought in his cause, he likewise forsook him\nthen, and fled unto Pompey. But Caesar sent his money and\n\n\n                   after him, and then went and encamped before the city\nof Corfinium, the which Domitius kept with thirty cohorts or\nensigns. When Domitius saw he was besieged, he straight\nthought himself but undone; and despairing of his success, he\nbade a physician, a slave of his, give him poison. The physician\ngave him a drink, which he drank, \n\n                   to have died. But\nshortly after, Domitius hearing them report what clemency and\nwonderful courtesy Caesar used unto them he took, repented\nhim then that he had drunk this drink, and began to lament and\nbewail his desperate resolution taken to die. The physician\ndid comfort him again, and told him that he had taken a drink\nonly to make him sleep, but not to destroy him. Then Domitius\nrejoiced, and went straight and yielded himself unto Caesar;\nwho gave him his life, but he notwithstanding stole away immediately\nand fled unto Pompey. When these news were\nbrought to Rome, they did marvellously rejoice and comfort\nthem that still remained there: and moreover there were \n\n                   them\nthat had forsaken Rome, which returned thither again. In the\nmeantime Caesar did put all Domitius' men in pay, and he did\nthe like through all the cities, where he had taken any captains\nthat levied men for Pompey.\n\n  Now Caesar, having assembled a great and dreadful\npower together, went straight where he thought to find Pompey\nhimself. But Pompey tarried not his coming, but fled into\nthe city of Brundusium; from whence he had sent the two\nConsuls before, with that army he had, unto Dyrrachium: and\nhe himself also went thither afterwards, when he understood\nthat Caesar was come, as you shall hear more amply hereafter\nin his life. Caesar lacked no good will to follow him, but,\n\n\n                  \n                   ships to take the seas, he returned forthwith to Rome:\nso that in less than threescore days he was lord of all Italy,\nwithout any bloodshed. Who when he was come to Rome,\nand found it much quieter then he looked for, and many\nsenators there also, he courteously \n\n                   them, and prayed\nthem to send unto Pompey to pacify all matters between them,\nupon reasonable conditions. But no man did attempt it, either\nbecause they feared Pompey, for that they had forsaken him, or\nelse for that they thought Caesar meant not as he spake, but\nthat they were \n\n                   to \n\n                   his purpose withal.\nAnd when Metellus also, one of the tribunes, would not suffer\nhim to take any of the common treasure out of the temple\nof Saturn, but told him that it was against the law: \"Tush,\"\nsaid he, \" time of war, and law, are \n\n                   things. If this that I\ndo,\" quoth he, \"do offend thee, then get thee hence for this time:\nfor war cannot abide this frank and bold speech. But when\nwars are done, and that we are all quiet again, then thou shalt\nspeak in the pulpit what thou wilt: and yet I do tell thee this of\nfavour, impairing so much my right; for thou art mine, both\nthou, and all them that have risen against me, and whom\nI have in my hands.\" When he had spoken thus unto\nMetellus, he went to the temple-door where the treasure lay,\nand, finding no keys there, he caused smiths to be sent for,\nand made them break open the locks. Metellus thereupon\nbegan again to withstand him, and certain men that stood by\npraised him in his doing: but Caesar at length, speaking bigly\nto him, threatened him he would kill him presently, if he\ntroubled him any more: and told him furthermore, \"Young\nman,\" quoth he, \" thou knowest it is harder for me to tell it\nthee, than to do it.\" That word made Metellus quake for fear,\nthat he got him away \n\n                  ; and ever after that Caesar had\nall at his commandment for the wars. \n                  From thence he went\ninto Spain, to make war with Petreius and Varro, Pompey's\nlieutenants: first to get their armies and provinces into his\nhands which they governed, that afterwards he might follow\nPompey the better, leaving never an enemy behind him. In\nthis journey he was oftentimes himself in danger through the\nambushes that were laid for him in divers strange sorts and\nplaces, and likely also to have lost all his army for lack of\nvictuals. All this notwithstanding, he never \n\n                   following of\nPompey's lieutenants, provoking them to battle and intrenching\nthem in, until he had gotten their camp and armies into\n\n\nhis hands, albeit that the lieutenants themselves fled unto\nPompey. When Caesar returned again to Rome, Piso his father-in-law\ngave him counsel to send ambassadors unto Pompey,\nto treat for peace. But Isauricus, to flatter Caesar, was\nagainst it.\n\n \n                  Caesar being then created Dictator by the Senate, called\nhome again all the banished men, and restored their children\nto honour, whose fathers before had been slain in Sylla's time:\nand did somewhat cut off the usuries that did oppress them;\nand besides, did make some such other ordinances as those,\nbut very few. For he was Dictator but eleven days only, and\nthen did yield it up of himself, and made himself Consul with\nServilius Isauricus, and after that determined to follow the\nwars. All the rest of his army he left, coming on the way,\nbehind him, and went himself before with six hundred horse,\nand five legions only of footmen, in the winter quarter, about\nthe month of January, which after the Athenians is called Posideon.\nThen having passed over the sea Ionium, and landed\nhis men, he \n\n                  \nthe cities of Oricum and Apollonia. Then\nhe sent his ships back again unto Brundusium, to transport\nthe rest of his soldiers that could not come with that speed\nhe did. They, as they came by the way, (like men whose\nstrength of body and lusty youth was decayed) being wearied\nwith so many sundry battles as they had fought with their\nenemies, complained of Caesar in this sort:\"To what end and\npurpose cloth this man \n\n                   us after him, up and down the\nworld, using us like slaves and drudges? It is not our armour,\nbut our bodies that bear the blows away: and what, shall we\nnever be without our \n\n                   on our backs, and our shields on\nour arms? Should not Caesar think, at the least when he seeth\nour blood and wounds, that we are all mortal men, and that\nwe feel the misery and pains that other men do feel? And now,\neven in the dead of winter, he putteth us unto the mercy of\nthe sea and tempest, yea, which the gods themselves cannot\nwithstand, as if he fled before his enemies and pursued them\nnot.\" Thus spending time with this talk, the soldiers, still\nmarching on, by small journeys came at length unto the city\nof Brundusium. But when they were come, and found that\nCaesar had already passed over the sea, then they \n\n                  \nchanged their complaints and minds. For they blamed themselves,\nand \n\n                   also with their captains, because they\nhad not made them make more haste in marching: and sitting\n\n\nupon the rocks and cliffs of the sea, they looked over the main\nsea, towards the realm of Epirus, to see if they could discern the\nships returning back to transport them over. Caesar in the\nmean time, being in the city of Apollonia, having but a small\narmy to fight with Pompey, it grieved him for that the rest\nof his army was so long a-coming, not knowing what way\nto take. In the end he followed a dangerous determination, to\n\n\n                   unknown in a little pinnace \nof 12 oars only, to pass\nover the sea again unto Brundusium, the which he could not\ndo without great danger, considering that all that sea was full of\nPompey's ships and armies. So he took ship in the night,\napparelled like a slave, and went aboard upon this little pinnace,\nand said never a word, as if he had been some poor man of\nmean condition. The pinnace lay in the mouth of the river of\nAnius, the which commonly was wont to be very calm and quiet,\nby reason of a little wind that came from the shore, which every\nmorning \n\n                   back the waves far into the main sea. But that\nnight (by ill fortune) there came a great wind from the sea, that\novercame the landwind, insomuch as, the force and strength\nof the river fighting against the violence of the rage and waves\nof the sea, the encounter was marvellous dangerous, the water\nof the river being driven back and rebounding upward, with\ngreat noise and danger in turning of the water. Thereupon\nthe master of the pinnace, seeing that he could not possibly\nget out of the mouth of this river, bade the mariners to \n\n                   again, and to return against the stream. Caesar hearing\nthat, straight discovered himself unto the master of the pinnace,\nwho at the first was amazed when he saw him; but Caesar\nthen taking him by the hand, said unto him, \" Good fellow,\nbe of good cheer, and forwards hardily; fear not, for thou hast\nCaesar and his fortune with thee.\" Then the mariners, forgetting\nthe danger of the storm they were in, \n\n                   with\noars, and laboured for life what they could against the wind, to\nget out of the mouth of this river. But at length, perceiving\nthey laboured in vain, and that the pinnace took in abundance\nof water, and was ready to sink, Caesar then, to his great\ngrief, was driven to return back again: who when he was returned\nunto his camp, his soldiers came in great companies\nunto him, and were very sorry that he mistrusted he was not\nable with them alone to overcome his enemies, but would put\nhis person in danger to go fetch them that were absent, putting\nno trust in them that were present. In the mean time\n\n\nAntonius arrived, and brought with him the rest of his army\nfrom Brundusium.\n\n \n                  Then Caesar, finding himself strong enough, went and\noffered Pompey battle, who was \n\n                  \nwell lodged for\nvictualling of his camp both by sea and land. Caesar on the\nother side, who had no great plenty of victuals at the first,\nwas in a very hard case: insomuch as his men gathered roots,\nand mingled them with milk, and \n\n                   them. Furthermore,\nthey did make bread of it also; and sometime when they\nskirmished with the enemies, and came along by them that\nwatched and \n\n                  , they cast \n\n                   their bread into their\ntrenches, and said that, as long as the earth brought forth\nsuch fruits, they would never leave besieging of Pompey. But\nPompey straitly commanded them, that they should neither\ncarry those words nor bread into their camp, fearing lest his\nmen's hearts would fail them, and that they would be afraid\nwhen they should think of their enemies' \n\n                  , with whom\nthey had to fight, \n\n                   they were weary with no pains, no more\nthan brute beasts. Caesar's men did daily skirmish hard to the\ntrenches of Pompey's camp, in the which Caesar had ever the\nbetter, saving once only, at which time his men fled with such\nfear, that all his camp that day was in great hazard to have been\ncast away. For Pompey came on with his battle upon them,\nand they were not able to abide it, but were fought with, and\ndriven into their camp, and their trenches were filled with dead\nbodies, which were slain within the very gate and bulwarks\nof their camp, they were so valiantly pursued. Caesar stood\nbefore them that fled, to make them to turn head again, but\nhe could not prevail. For when he would have taken the\nensigns to have stayed them, the ensign-bearers threw them\ndown on the ground: so that the enemies took two and thirty of\nthem, and Caesar's self also escaped hardly with life. For, striking\na great big soldier that fled by him, commanding him to\n\n\n                   and turn his face to his enemy: the soldier, being afraid,\n\n\n                   up his sword to strike at Caesar. But one of Caesar's pages,\n\n\n                   him, gave him such a blow with his sword that he\n\n\n                   off his shoulder. Caesar that day was brought unto so\ngreat extremity, that (if Pompey had not either for fear, or\nspiteful fortune, left off to follow his victory, and retired into his\ncamp, being contented to have driven his enemies into their\ncamp) returning to his camp with his friends, he said unto them:\n\"The victory this day had been our enemies', if they had had a\n\ncaptain that could have told how to have overcome.\" So when\nhe was come to his lodging, he went to bed, and that night\ntroubled him more than any night that ever he had. For still\nhis mind ran with great sorrow of the foul fault he had committed\nin leading of his army, of self-will to remain there so\nlong by the sea-side, his enemies being the stronger by sea,\nconsidering that he had before him a goodly country, rich and\nplentiful of all things, and goodly cities of Macedon and Thessaly:\nand had not the wit to bring the war from thence, but to\nlose his time in a place, where he was rather besieged of his\nenemies for lack of victuals than that he did besiege them by\nforce of arms. Thus fretting and chafing to see himself so\n\n\n                   \n                  \n                   victuals, and to think of his ill luck he raised\nhis camp, intending to \n\n                   Scipio, making account,\nthat either he should draw Pompey to battle against his will,\nwhen he had not the sea at his back to furnish him with plenty\nof victuals; or else that he should easily overcome Scipio, finding\nhim alone, unless he were aided. \n                  This remove of Caesar's\ncamp did much encourage Pompey's army and his captains,\nwho would needs in any case have followed after him, as though\nhe had been overcome and had fled. But for Pompey himself,\nhe would in no respect hazard battle, which was a matter of so\ngreat importance. For finding himself so well provided of all\nthings necessary to tarry time, he thought it better to draw this\nwar out in length by \n\n                   of time, the rather to consume this\nlittle strength that remained in Caesar's army: of the which, the\nbest men were marvellous well trained and good soldiers, and\nfor valiantness at one day's battle were incomparable. But on\nthe other side again, to remove here and there so oft, and to\nfortify their camp where they came, and to besiege any wall, or\nto keep watch all night in their armour: the most part of them\ncould not do it, by reason of their age, being then unable to\n\n\n                   their pains, so that the weakness of their bodies did\nalso take away the life and courage of their hearts. Furthermore,\nthere fell a pestilent disease among them, that came by ill\nmeats hunger \n\n                   them to eat. Yet was not this the worst:\nfor besides, he had no store of money, neither could tell how to\n\n\n                   victuals; so that it seemed, in all likelihood, that in\nvery short time he would come to nothing. For these respects\nPompey would in no case fight, and yet had he but Cato only of\nhis mind in that, who \n\n                   in it the rather, because he would\navoid shedding of his countrymen's blood. For when Cato had\n\n\nviewed the dead bodies slain in the camp of his enemies at the\nlast skirmish that was between them, the which were no less\nthan a thousand persons, he covered his face, and went away\nweeping. All \n\n                   but he, \n\n                  , fell out with him, and\nblamed him because he so long refrained from battle: and some\npricks him forward, and called him Agamemnon, and king of\nkings, saying that he delayed this war in this sort, because he\nwould not leave his authority to command them all, and that\nhe was glad always to see many captains round about him,\nwhich came to his lodging to honour him and wait upon him.\nAnd Faonius also, a hare-brained fellow, franticly counterfeiting\nthe \n\n                   and plain speech of Cato, made as though he was\nmarvellous angry, and said: \" Is it not great pity, that we shall\nnot eat this year of Tusculum figs, and all for Pompey's ambitious\nmind to reign alone?\" and Afranius, who not long before was\nbut lately come out of Spain (where, because he had but ill success,\nhe was accused of treason, that for money he had sold his\narmy unto Caesar), he went busily asking, \" why they fought not\nwith that merchant, unto whom they said he had sold the\nprovince of Spain? \" So that Pompey, with these kinds of\nspeeches, against his will, was driven to follow Caesar to fight\nwith him. Then was Caesar at the first marvellously perplexed\nand troubled by the way, because he found none that would\ngive him any victuals, being despised of every man for the late\nloss and overthrow he had received. But after he had taken the\ncity of Gomphes in Thessaly, he did not only meet with plenty\nof victuals to relieve his army with, but he strangely also did rid\nthem of their disease. For the soldiers meeting with plenty of\nwine, drinking hard, and making merry, crave away the infection\nof the pestilence. For they disposed themselves unto dancing,\nmasking, and playing the \n\n                   by the way, insomuch\nthat drinking drunk they overcame their disease, and made their\nbodies new again.\n\n\n                   When they both came into the country of Pharsalia,\nand troth camps lay before each other, Pompey returned again\nto his former determination, and the rather, because he had ill\nsigns and tokens of misfortune in his sleep. For he thought\nin his sleep that, when he entered into the theatre, all the\nRomans received him with great clapping of hands*. Whereupon\nthey that were about him grew to such boldness \nand\nsecurity, assuring themselves of victory, that Domitius, \nSpinther,\nand Scipio in a \n\n                   contended between themselves for the\n\n\nchief bishopric which Caesar had. Furthermore, there were\ndivers that sent unto Rome to hire the nearest houses unto the\nmarket-place, as being the fittest places for Praetors and\nConsuls: making their account already, that those offices could\nnot scape them, \n\n                   after the wars. But besides\nthose, the young gentlemen and Roman knights were marvellous\ndesirous to fight, that were bravely mounted, and armed\nwith \n\n                   gilt armours, their horses fat and very finely\nkept, and themselves goodly young men, to the number of seven\nthousand, where the gentlemen of Caesar's side were but one\nthousand only. The number of his \n\n                   also were much\nafter the same reckoning. For he had five and forty thousand\nagainst two and twenty thousand. Wherefore Caesar called his\nsoldiers together, and told them how Cornificius was at hand\nwho brought two whole legions, and that he had fifteen ensigns\nled by Calenus, the which he made to stay about Megara and\nAthens. Then he asked them, if they would tarry for that aid\nor not, or whether they would rather themselves alone venture\nbattle. The soldiers cried out to him, and prayed him not to\ndefer battle, but rather to devise some \n\n                   to make the enemy\nfight as soon as he could. Then as he sacrificed unto the \ngods,\nfor the purifying of his army, the first beast was no sooner sacrificed\nbut his soothsayer assured him that he should fight within\nthree days. Caesar asked him again, if he saw in the sacrifices\nany lucky sign or token of good luck. The soothsayer answered:\n\" For that, thou shalt answer thyself better than I can do: for\nthe gods do promise us a marvellous great change and alteration \nof things that are now, unto another clean contrary. For if thou \nbeest well now, cost thou think to have worse fortune hereafter ? \nand if thou be ill, assure thyself thou shalt have better.\" The\nnight before the battle, as he went about midnight to visit the \nwatch, men saw a great firebrand in the \n\n                  , ail of a \nlight fire, that came over Caesar's camp, and fell down in \nPompey's. In the morning also, when they relieved the watch, \nthey heard a false alarm in the enemies' camp, without any apparent\ncause: which they commonly call a sudden fear, that \nmakes men \n\n                   themselves. This notwithstanding, Caesar \nthought not to fight that day, but was determined to have raised\n\nhis camp from thence, and to have gone towards the city of \nScotusa: and his tents in his camp were already \n\n                  ,\nwhen his scouts came in with great speed, to bring him news\nthat his enemies were preparing, themselves to fight. Then was\n\n\nhe very glad, and after he had made his prayers unto the gods\nto help him that day, he set his men in battle \n\n                  , and divided\nthem into three squadrons, giving the middle \n\n                   unto Domitius\nCalvinus, and the left wing unto Antonius, and placed himself\nin the right wing, choosing his place to fight in the tenth\nlegion. But seeing that against that his enemies had set all\ntheir horsemen, he was half afraid when he saw the great number\nof them, and so brave besides. Wherefore he \n\n                   made six\nensigns to come from the \n\n                   of his battle, whom he had\nlaid as an ambush behind his right wing, having first appointed\nhis soldiers what they should do when the horsemen of the\nenemies came to give them charge. On the other side Pompey\nplaced himself in the right wing of his battle, gave the left wing\nunto Domitius, and the middle battle unto Scipio his father-inlaw.\nNow all the Roman knights (as we have told you before)\nwere placed in the left wing, \n\n                   to environ Caesar's right\nwing behind, and to give their hottest charge there, where the\ngeneral of their enemies was: making their account, that there\nwas no squadron of footmen, how thick soever they were, that\ncould receive the charge of so great a troop of horsemen, and\nthat at the first onset they should overthrow them all, and march\nupon their bellies. When the trumpets on either side did sound\nthe alarm to the battle, Pompey commanded his footmen that\nthey should stand still without stirring, to receive the charge of\ntheir enemies, until they came to throwing of their darts.\nWherefore Caesar afterwards said, that Pompey had committed a\nfoul fault, not to consider that the charge which is given running\nwith fury, besides that it giveth the more strength also unto\ntheir blows, cloth set men's hearts also on fire: for the common\n\n\n                   of all the soldiers that run together, is unto them as a\nbox on the ear that sets men on fire. Then Caesar, making his\n\n\n                   march forward to give the onset, saw one of his captains\n(a valiant man, and very skilful in war, in whom he had also\ngreat confidence) speaking to his soldiers that he had under his\ncharge, encouraging them to fight like men that day. So he\ncalled him aloud by his name, and said unto him: \"Well, Caius\nCrassinius, what hope shall we have to-day? how are we determined,\nto fight it out manfully? \" Then Crassinius, casting\nup his hand, answered him aloud: \"This day, O Caesar, we\nI shall have a noble victory, and I promise thee ere night thou\nshalt praise me alive or dead.\" When he had told him so, he\nwas himself the foremost man that gave charge upon his enemies,\n\n\nwith his band following of him, being about six score men; and\nmaking a lane through the foremost ranks with great slaughter,\nhe entered far into the battle of his enemies, until that, valiantly\nfighting in this sort, he was thrust in at length into the mouth\nwith a sword, that the point of it came out again at his neck.\n\n                  Now the footmen of both battles being come to the sword, the\nhorsemen of the left wing of Pompey did march as fiercely also,\nspreading out their troops, to compass in the right wing of\nCaesar's battle. But before they began to give charge, the six\nensigns of footmen which Caesar had laid in ambush behind him,\nthey began to run full upon them, not throwing away their darts\nfar off, as they were wont to do, neither striking their enemies\non the thighs nor on the legs, but to seek to hit them full in the\neyes, and to hurt them in the face, as Caesar had taught them.\nFor he hoped that these lusty young gentlemen that had not\nbeen often in the wars nor were used to see themselves hurt,\nand the which, being in the prime of their youth and beauty,\nwould be afraid of those hurts, as well for the fear of the\npresent danger to be slain, as also for that their faces should\nnot for ever be deformed. As indeed it came to pass, for they\ncould never abide that they should come so near their faces\nwith the points of their darts, but hung down their heads for\nfear to be hit with them in their eyes, and turned their backs,\ncovering their face because they should not be hurt. Then,\n\n                  , they began at length cowardly to fly,\nand were occasion also of the loss of all the rest of Pompey's\narmy. For they that had broken them ran immediately to\nset upon the squadron of the footmen behind, and slew them.\nThen Pompey, seeing his horsemen, from the other wing of\nhis battle, so scattered and dispersed, flying away, forgat that\nhe was any more Pompey the Great, which he had been before,\nbut was rather like a man whose wits the gods had taken\nfrom him, being afraid and amazed with the slaughter sent\nfrom above, and so retired into his tent, speaking never a\nword, and sat there to see the end of this battle; until at\nthe length all his army being overthrown and put to flight,\nthe enemies came, and got up upon the \n\n                   and defence\nof his camp, and fought hand to hand with them that stood\nto defend the same. Then as a man come to himself again,\nhe spake but this only word: \"What, even into our camp?\"\nSo in haste, casting off his \n\n                   and apparel of a\ngeneral, he \n\n                  , and put on such as became his\n\n\n                  miserable fortune, and so stole out of his camp. Furthermore,\nwhat he did after this overthrow, and how he had put himself\ninto the hands of the Egyptians' by whom he was miserably\nslain, we have set it forth at large in his life. Then Caesar,\nentering into Pompey's camp, and seeing the bodies laid on\nthe ground that were slain, and others also that were a-killing\nsaid, fetching a great sigh: \"It was their own doing, and\nagainst my will. For Caius Caesar, after he had won so many\nfamous conquests, and overcome so many great battles, had\nbeen utterly condemned notwithstanding, if he had departed\nfrom his army.\" Asinius Pollio writeth, that he spake these\nwords then in Latin, which he afterwards wrote in Greek; and\nsaith furthermore, that the most part of them which were put to\nthe sword in the camp were slaves and bondmen, and that there\nwere not slain in all this battle above six thousand soldiers. As\nfor them that were taken prisoners, Caesar did put many of\nthem amongst his legions, and did pardon also many men of\nestimation, among whom Brutus was one, that afterwards slew\nCaesar himself: and it is reported that Caesar was very sorry\nfor him, when he could not immediately be found after the\nbattle, and that he rejoiced again when he knew he was alive,\nand that he came to yield himself unto him. Caesar had many\nsigns and tokens of victory before this battle, but the notablest\nof all other that happened to him, was in the city of Tralles.\nFor in the temple of Victory, within the same city, there was\nan image of Caesar, and the earth all about it very hard of itself,\nand was paved besides with hard stone: and yet some say that\nthere sprang up a palm hard by the base of the same image. In\nthe city of Padua, Caius Cornelius, an excellent soothsayer (a\ncountryman and friend of Titus Livius the historiographer), was\nby chance at that time set to behold the flying of birds. He (as\nLivy reporteth) knew the very time when the battle began, and\ntold them that were present, \" Even now they give the onset on\nboth sides, and both armies do meet at this instant.\" Then sitting\ndown again, to consider of the birds, after he had bethought\nhim of the signs, he suddenly rose up on his feet, and cried out\nas a man possessed with some spirit: \" O Caesar, the victory is\nthine.\" Every man wondering to see him, he took the crown\nhe had on his head, and made an oath that he would never put\nit on again, till the event of his prediction had proved his art\ntrue. Livy testifieth that it came so to pass. Caesar afterwards\ngiving freedom unto the Thessalians, in respect of the victory\n\nwhich he \n\n                   in their country, he followed after Pompey.\nWhen he came into Asia, he gave freedom also unto the Guidians\nfor Theopompus' sake, who had gathered the fables together.\nHe did release Asia also the third part of the tribute which the\ninhabitants paid unto the Romans. Then he came into Alexandria\nafter Pompey was slain: and detested Theodotus that\npresented him Pompey's head, and turned his head aside because\nhe would not see it. Notwithstanding, he took his seal,\nand beholding it, wept.  Furthermore, he courteously used all\nPompey's friends and familiars, who wandering up and down\nthe country, were taken \n\n                   \n the king of Egypt, and \n\n                   them all\nto be at his commandment. Continuing these courtesies, he\nwrote unto his friends at Rome. that the greatest pleasure he\ntook of his victory was, that he daily saved the lives of some of \nhis countrymen that bare arms against him.\n\n \n                  And for the war he made in Alexandria, some say he \nneeded not to have done it, but that he willingly did it for the \nlove of Cleopatra: wherein he \n\n                   little honour, and besides\ndid put his person in great danger. Others do lay the fault Upon\nthe king of Egypt's ministers, but specially on Pothinus the\neunuch, who bearing the greatest sway of all the king's servants,\nafter he had caused Pompey to be slain, and driven Cleopatra\nfrom the court, secretly laid wait all the ways he could, how he \nmight likewise kill Caesar. Wherefore Caesar, hearing an \n\n                  \nof it, began thenceforth to spend all the night long in feasting\nand banqueting, that his person might be in the better safety.\nBut besides all this, Pothinus the eunuch spake many things\nopenly, not to be borne, only to shame Caesar, and to stir up the\npeople to envy him. For he made his soldiers have the worst\nand oldest wheat that could be gotten: then, if they did complain\nof it, he told them they must be contented, seeing they eat\nat another man's cost. And he would serve them also at the\ntable in \n\n                   and earthen dishes, saying, 'that Caesar had\naway all their gold and silver, for a debt that the king's father\n(that then reigned) did owe unto him :' which was a thousand\nseven hundred and fifty \n\n                  ; whereof Caesar had before\nforgiven seven hundred and fifty thousand unto his children.\nHowbeit then he asked a million to pay his soldiers withal\nThereto Pothinus answered him, that at that time he should do\nbetter to follow his other causes of greater importance, and afterwards\nthat he should at more leisure recover his debt, with the\nking's good will and favour. Caesar replied unto him, and said,\n\n\nthat he would not ask counsel of the Egyptians for his affairs,\nbut would be paid: and thereupon secretly sent for Cleopatra,\nwhich was in the country, to come unto him. She, only taking\nApollodorus Sicilian of all her friends, took a little boat, and\nwent away with him in it in the night, and came and landed\nhard by the foot of the castle. Then having no other \n\n                   \nto come into the court without being known, she laid herself down\nupon a mattress or flockbed, which Apollodorus her friend tied\nand bound up together like a bundle with a great leather thong,\nand so took her upon his back and brought her thus hampered\nin this \n\n                   unto Caesar in at the castle gate. This was the\nfirst occasion (as it is reported) that made Caesar to love her:\nbut afterwards, when he saw her sweet \n\n                   and\npleasant entertainment, he fell then in further liking with her,\nand did reconcile her again unto her brother the king, with condition\nthat they two jointly should reign together. Upon this\nnew reconciliation, a great feast being prepared, a slave of Caesar's\nthat was his barber, the fearfullest wretch that lived, \n\n                  \nbusily prying and listening abroad in every corner, being mistrustful\nby nature, found that Pothinus and Achillas did lie in wait to\nkill his master Caesar. This being proved unto Caesar, he did\nset such sure watch about the hall, where the feast was made,\nthat in \n\n                   he slew the eunuch Pothinus himself. Achillas\non the other side saved himself, and fled unto the king's camp,\nwhere he raised a marvellous dangerous and difficult war for\nCaesar: because he, having then but a few men about him,\nwas to fight against a great and strong city. The first danger\nhe fell into was the want of water: for that his enemies had\nstopped the mouth of the pipes, the which conveyed the water\ninto the castle. The second danger he had was, that seeing\nhis enemies came to take his ships from him, he was driven\nto repulse that danger with fire, the which burnt the arsenal\nwhere the ships lay, and that notable library of Alexandria\nwithal. The third danger was in the battle by sea, that was\nfought by the tower of \n\n                  : where \n\n                   to help his men\nthat fought by sea, he leapt from the pier into a boat. Then\nthe Egyptians made towards him with their oars on every side:\nbut he, leaping into the sea, with great hazard saved himself\nby swimming. It is said, that then, holding divers books in\nhis hand, he did never let them go, but kept them always\nupon his head above water, and swam with the other hand,\nnotwithstanding that they shot marvellously at him, and was\n\n\ndriven sometime to duck into the water: howbeit the boat was\ndrowned \n\n                  . In fine, the king coming to his men that\nmade war with Caesar, he went against him and gave him\nbattle, and \n\n                  \n it with great slaughter and effusion of blood.\nBut for the king, no man could ever tell what became of him\nafter. Thereupon Caesar made Cleopatra his sister queen of\nEgypt, who, being great with child by him, was shortly brought\nto bed of a son, whom the Alexandrians named Caesarion.\n\n\n                   From thence he went into Syria, and so going into\nAsia, there it was told him that Domitias was overthrown in\nbattle by Pharnaces, the son of king Mithridates, and was fled\nout of the realm of Pont with a few men with him: and that\nthis king Pharnaces, greedily following his victory, was not\ncontented with the winning of Bithynia and Cappadocia, but\nfurther would needs attempt to win Armenia the less, \n\n                  \nall those kings, princes, and governors of the provinces\nthereabouts to rebel against the Romans. Thereupon Caesar\nwent thither straight with three legions, and fought a great\nbattle with king Pharnaces by the city of Zela, where he slew\nhis army, and \n\n                   him out of all the realm of Pont. And\nbecause he would advertise one of his friends of the suddenness\nof this victory, he only wrote three words unto Anitius at Rome:\n\"\"Veni, vidi, vici:\" I came, I saw, I overcame.\" These\nthree words, ending all with like sound and letter in the Latin,\nhave a certain short grace more pleasant to the ear than can\nbe well expressed in any other tongue. After this he returned\nagain into Italy and came to Rome, ending his year for the\nwhich he was made dictator the second time, which office\nbefore was never granted for one whole year, \n\n                   unto him.\nThen was he chosen consul for the year following. Afterwards\nhe was very ill spoken of, for that his soldiers in a mutiny\nhaving slain two Praetors, Cosconius and Galba, he gave them\nno other punishment for it, but instead of calling them soldiers\nhe named them citizens, and gave unto every one of them a\nthousand drachmas a man, and great possessions in Italy.\nHe was much misliked also for the desperate \n\n                  \nand madness\nof Dolabella, for the covetousness of Anitius, for the drunkenness\nof Antonius and Cornificius; which made Pompey's\nhouse be pulled down and builded up again, as a thing not\nbig enough for him, wherewith the Romans were marvellously\noffended. Caesar knew all this well enough, and would have\nbeen contented to have redressed them: but to bring his\n\n\nmatters to pass, he pretended he was driven to serve his turn by\nsuch instruments.\n\n \n                  \n                  After the battle of Pharsalia, Cato and Scipio being fled\ninto Africa, king joined with them, and levied a great \n\n                  \narmy. Wherefore Caesar determined to make war with\nthem: and, in the \n\n                   of winter, he took his journey into\nSicily. There, because he would take all hope from his captains\nand soldiers to make any long abode there, he went and lodged\nupon the very sands by the seaside, and with the next gale of wind\nthat came, he took the sea with three thousand footmen and a\nfew horsemen. Then having put them  \n\n                  , unawares to them\nhe \n\n                   sail again to fetch the rest of his army, being afraid\nlest they should meet with some danger in passing over; and\nmeeting them midway, he brought them all into his camp.\nWhere, when it was told him that his enemies trusted in an\nancient oracle, which said, that it was predestined unto the\nfamily of the Scipios to be conquerors in Africa: either of purpose\nto mock Scipio, the general of his enemies, or \n\n                  ,\nin good earnest, to take the benefit of this name (given by the\noracle) unto himself, in all the skirmishes and battles fought, he\ngave the charge of his army unto a man of mean quality and\naccount, called Scipio Salutius, who came of the race of Scipio\nAfrican, and made him always general when he fought. For he\nwas \n\n                   compelled to weary and harry his enemies, for that\nneither his men in his camp had corn enough, nor the beasts\nforage, but the soldiers were driven to take sea-weeds, called\n\n                  : and (washing away the brackishness thereof with fresh\nwater, putting to it a little herb called dog's-tooth) to cast it so\nto their \n\n                   to eat. For the Numidians (which are light\nhorsemen, and very ready of service) being a great number\ntogether, would be on a sudden in every place, and spread all\nthe fields over thereabout, so that no man durst peep out of the\ncamp to go for forage. And one day, as the men of arms were\nstaying to behold an African doing notable things in dancing\nand playing with the flute (they being set down quietly to take\ntheir pleasure of the view thereof, having in the meantime\ngiven their slaves their horses to hold) the enemies stealing suddenly\nupon them, compassed them in round about, and slew a\nnumber of them in the field, and chasing the other also that fled,\nfollowed them pellmell into their camp. Furthermore, had not\nCaesar himself in person, and Asinius Pollio with him, gone out\nof the camp to the rescue and stayed them that fled, the war that\n\nday had been ended. There was also another skirmish where\nhis enemies had the upper hand, in the which it is reported\nthat Caesar, taking the ensign-bearer by the collar that carried\nthe eagle in his hand, stayed him by force, and turning his\nface, told him: \" See, there be thy enemies.\" \n\nThese advantages\ndid lift up Scipio's heart aloft, and gave him courage to hazard\nbattle: and leaving Afranius on the one hand of him, and king\nJuba on the other hand, both their camps lying near together,\nhe did fortify himself by the city of Thapsacus, above the lake,\nto be a safe refuge for them all in this battle. But whilst he was\nbusy intrenching of himself, Caesar, having marvellous speedily\npassed through a great country full of wood by by-paths which\nmen would never have \n\n                  : he stole upon some behind,\nand suddenly assailed the other before, so that he overthrew\nthem all, and made them fly. Then following the first good\nhap he had, he went forthwith to set upon the camp of Afranius,\nthe which he took at the first onset, and the camp of the Numidians\nalso, king Juba being fled. Thus in a little piece of the\nday only, he took three camps, and slew fifty thousand of his\nenemies, and lost but fifty of his soldiers. In this sort is set\ndown the effect of this battle by some writers. Yet others do\nwrite also, that Caesar self was not there in person at the execution\nof this battle. For as he did set his men in battle \n\n                  ,\n\n                   took him, whereunto he was given; and\ntherefore feeling it coming, before he was overcome withal,\nhe was carried into a castle not far from thence where the\nbattle was fought, and there took his rest till the extremity of\nhis disease had left him. Now \n\n                   the Praetor and Consuls\nthat scaped from this battle, many of them being taken\nprisoners did kill themselves, and others also Caesar did put\nto death:\n\n but he being specially desirous of all men else to\nhave Cato alive in his hands, he went with all possible speed\nunto the city of Utica, whereof Cato was governor, by means\nwhereof 'he was not at the battle. Notwithstanding being certified\nby the way that Cato had slain himself with his own hands,\nhe then made open show that he was very sorry for it, but\nwhy or wherefore, no man could tell. But this is true, that\nCaesar said at that present time: \"O Cato, I envy thy death,\nbecause thou didst envy my glory to save thy life.\" This notwithstanding,\nthe book that he wrote afterwards against Cato,\nbeing dead, did shew no very great affection nor pitiful heart\ntowards him. For how could he have pardoned him, if living\n\n\nhe had had him in his hands, that being dead did speak so\nvehemently against him? Notwithstanding, men suppose he\nwould have pardoned him, if he had taken him alive, by the\nclemency he shewed unto Cicero, Brutus, and divers others that\nhad borne arms against him. Some report that he wrote that\nbook, not so much for any private malice he had to his death,\nas for civil ambition, upon this occasion. Cicero had written a\nbook in praise of Cato, which he entitled 'Cato.' This book in\nlikelihood was very well liked of, by reason of the eloquence of\nthe orator that made it, and of the excellent subject thereof\nCaesar therewith was marvellously offended, thinking that to\npraise him of whose death he was author was even so much\nas to accuse himself: and therefore he wrote a letter against\nhim, and heaped up a number of accusations against Cato,\nand entitled the book 'Anticaton.' Both these books have\nfavourers unto this day, some defending the one for the love\nthey bear to Caesar, and others \n\n                  the other for Cato's\nsake.\n\n\n                  Caesar, being now returned out of Africa, first of all made\nan oration to the people wherein he greatly praised and commended\nthis his last victory, declaring unto them that he had\nconquered so many countries unto the empire of Rome, that he\ncould furnish the commonwealth yearly with two hundred thousand\nbushels of wheat, and twenty hundred thousand pound\nweight of oil. Then he made three triumphs, the one for Egypt,\nthe other for the kingdom of Pont, and the third for Africa: not\nbecause he had overcome Scipio there, but king Juba. Whose\nson being likewise called Juba, being then a young boy, was led\ncaptive in the show of this triumph. But this his imprisonment\nfell out happily for him: for, where he was but a barbarous\nNumidian, by the study he fell unto when he was prisoner,\nhe came afterwards to be reckoned one of the wisest historiographers\nof the Grecians. After these three triumphs ended,\nhe very liberally rewarded his soldiers: and to curry favour\nwith the people, he made great feasts and common sports. For\nhe feasted all the Romans at one time, at two and twenty\nthousand tables, and gave them the pleasure to see divers\nsword-players to fight \n\n                  , and battles also by sea,\nfor the remembrance of his daughter Julia, which was dead\nlong before. Then after all these sports, he made the people\n(as the manner was) to be mustered: and where there were, at\nthe last musters before, three hundred and twenty thousand\n\n\ncitizens, at this muster there were only but a hundred and fifty\nthousand. Such misery and destruction had this civil war\nbrought unto the commonwealth of Rome, and had consumed\nsuch a number of Romans, not speaking at all of the mischiefs\nand calamities it had brought unto all the rest of Italy, and to\nthe other provinces pertaining to Rome.\n\n\n                   \n                  After all these things were ended, he was chosen Consul\nthe fourth time, and went into Spain to make war with the sons\nof Pompey: who were yet but very young, but had notwithstanding\nraised a marvellous great army together, and shewed they\nhad manhood and courage worthy to command such an army,\ninsomuch as they put Caesar himself in great danger of his life.\nThe greatest battle that was fought between them in all this war,\nwas by the city of Munda. For then Caesar, seeing his men\nsorely distressed, and having their hands full of their enemies,\nhe ran into the \n\n                   among his men that fought, and cried out\nunto them: \"What, are ye not ashamed to be beaten and taken\nprisoners, yielding yourselves with your own hands to these\nyoung boys?\" And so, with all the force he could make, having\nwith much ado put his enemies to flight, he slew above thirty\nthousand of them in the field, and lost of his own men a thousand\nof the best he had. After this battle he went into his tent\nand told his friends, that he had often before fought for victory,\nbut, this last time now, that he had fought for the safety of his\nown life He \n\n                   this battle on the very feast-day of the\nBacchanalians, in the which men say that Pompey the Great\nwent out of Rome, about four years before, to begin this civil\nwar. \n\n                   his sons, the younger scaped from the battle; but,\nwithin few days after, Didius brought the head of the elder.\nThis was the last war that Caesar made. But the triumph he\nmade into Rome for the same did as much offend the Romans,\nand more, than any thing that ever he had done before: because\nhe had not overcome captains that were strangers, nor barbarous\nkings, but had destroyed the sons of the noblest man of\nRome, whom fortune had overthrown. And because he had\nplucked up his race by the roots, men did not think it meet for\nhim to triumph so for the calamities of his country, rejoicing at\na thing for the which he had but one excuse to allege in his\ndefence unto the gods and men, that he was compelled to do\nthat he did. And the rather they thought it not meet, because\nhe had never before sent letters nor messengers unto the\ncommonwealth at Rome, for any victory that he had ever won\n\n\nin all the civil wars: but did always for shame refuse the glory\nof it.\n\n\n                  This notwithstanding, the Romans, inclining to Caesar's\nprosperity and taking the bit in the mouth, supposing that to be\nruled by one man alone, it would be a good \n\n                   for them to\ntake breath a little, after so many troubles and miseries as they\nhad \n\n                   in these civil wars, they chose him perpetual Dictator.\nThis was a plain tyranny: for to this absolute power of\nDictator, they added this, never to be afraid to be deposed.\nCicero pronounced before the Senate, that they should give him\nsuch honours as were meet for amen: howbeit others afterwards\nadded too honours beyond all reason. For men striving who\nshould most honour him, they made him hateful and troublesome\nto themselves that most favoured him, by reason of the unmeasurable\ngreatness and honours which they gave him. Thereupon\nit is reported, that even they that most hated him were no\nless favourers and furtherers of his honours than they that most\nflattered him,- because they might have greater \n\n                   to\n\n\n                  , and that it might appear they had just cause and \n\n                  \nto attempt that they did against him. And now for himself, after\nhe had ended his civil wars, he did so honourably behave himself,\nthat there was no fault to be found in him: and therefore\nmethinks, amongst other honours they gave him, he rightly deserved\nthis, that they should build him a temple of Clemency, to\nthank him for his courtesy he had used unto them in his victory.\nFor he pardoned many of them that had borne arms against\nhim, and furthermore, did prefer some of them to honour and\noffice in the commonwealth: as, amongst others, Cassius and\nBrutus, both the which were made Praetors. And, where Pompey's\nimages had been thrown down, he caused them to be set\nup again: whereupon Cicero said then, that, Caesar setting up\nPompey's images again, he made his own to stand the surer.\nAnd when some of his friends did counsel him to have a guard\nfor the safety of his person, and some also did offer themselves\nto serve him, he would never consent to it, but said: \"It was\nbetter to die once, than always to be afraid of death.\" But to\nwin himself the love and goodwill of the people, as the honourablest\nguard and best safety he could have, he made common\nfeasts again and general distributions of corn. Furthermore, to\ngratify the soldiers also, he replenished many cities again with\ninhabitants, which before had been destroyed, and placed them\nthere that had no place to repair unto: of the which the noblest\n\n\nand chiefest cities were these two, Carthage and Corinth: and\nit chanced also, that like as aforetime they had been both taken\nand destroyed together, even so were they both set on foot again,\nand replenished with people, at one \n\n                   time. And as for greet\npersonages, he \n\n                   them also, promising some of them to make\nthem Praetors and Consuls in time to come; and unto others\nhonours and preferments: but to all men generally good hope,\nseeking all the ways he could to make every man contented\nwith his reign. Insomuch as one of his Consuls called Maximus,\nchancing to die a day before his consulship ended, he\ndeclared Caninius Rebilius Consul only for the day that remained.\nSo, divers going to his house (as the manner was) to salute him,\nand to congratulate with him of his calling and preferment,\nbeing newly chosen officer, Cicero pleasantly said: \"Come, let\nus make haste, and be gone thither before his consulship \n\n                  .\" Furthermore, Caesar being born to attempt all great\nenterprises, and having an ambitious desire besides to covet\ngreat honours, the prosperous good success he had of his former\nconquests bred no desire in him quietly to enjoy the fruits of his\nlabours; but rather gave him the hope of things to come, still\nkindling more and more in him thoughts of greater enterprises\nand desire of new glory, as if that which he had present were\nstale and nothing worth. This humour of his was no other but\nan emulation with himself as with another man, and a certain\ncontention to overcome the things he prepared to attempt. For\nhe was determined, and made preparation also, to make war\nwith the Persians. Then, when he had overcome them, to pass\nthrough Hyrcania (compassing in the sea Caspium, and mount\nCaucasus) into the realm of Pontus, and so to invade Scythia:\nand, overrunning all the countries and people adjoining unto\nhigh Germany, and Germany itself, at length to return by Gaul\ninto Italy, and so to enlarge the Roman empire round, that it\nmight be every way compassed in with the great sea Oceanum.\nBut whilst he was preparing for this voyage, he attempted to cut\nthe bar of the \n\n                   of Peloponnesus, in the market-place\nwhere the city of Corinth standeth. Then he was minded to\nbring the rivers of Anienes and Tiber straight from Rome unto\nthe city of \n\n                  , with a deep channel and high banks cast\nup on either side, and so to fall into the sea at Terracina, for\nthe better safety and commodity of the merchants that came to\nRome to traffic there. Furthermore, he determined to drain\nand \n\n                   all the water of the \n\n                   betwixt the cities of\n\nNomentum and Setium, to make firm land, for the benefit of\nmany thousands of people: and on the sea-coast next unto\nRome, to cast great high banks, and to cleanse all the haven\nabout Ostia of rocks and stones hidden under the water, and to\ntake away all other impediments that made the \n\n                  \n\ndangerous for ships, and to make new havens and arsenals\nmeet to harbour such ships as did continually traffic thither.\nAll these things were purposed to be done, but took no effect.\n\n\n                  \n                  But the \n\n                   of the calendar, and reformation of\nthe year, to take away all confusion of time, being exactly calculated\nby the mathematicians and brought to perfection, was a\ngreat commodity unto all men. For the Romans, using then the\nancient computation of the year, had not only such uncertainty\nand alteration of the month and times, that the sacrifices and\nyearly feasts came, by little and little, to seasons contrary for\nthe purpose they were ordained: but also, in the revolution of\nthe sun (which is called Annus Solaris) no other nation agreed\nwith them in account: and, of the Romans themselves, only\nthe priests understood it. And therefore when they \n\n                  , they\nsuddenly (no man being able to control them) did thrust in a\nmonth above their ordinary number, which they called in old\ntime \n\n                  . Some say that Numa Pompilius was the\nfirst that devised this way, to put a month between: but it was\na weak remedy, and did little help the correction of the errors\nthat were made in the account of the year, to \n\n                   them to\nperfection. But Caesar, committing this matter unto the philosophers\nand best expert mathematicians at that time, did set\nforth an excellent and perfect calendar, more exactly calculated\nthan any other that was before: the which the Romans do use\nuntil this present day, and \n\n                   err as others in the\ndifference of time. But his enemies notwithstanding, that envied\nhis greatness, did not stick to find fault withal. As Cicero the\norator, when one said, \"to-morrow the star Lyra will rise :\"\n\"Yea,\" said he, \"at the commandment of Caesar;\" as if men\nwere compelled so to say and think by Caesar's edict. \n                  But the\nchiefest cause that made him mortally hated was the covetous\ndesire he had to be called king: which first gave the people\njust cause, and next his secret enemies honest \n\n                  , to\nbear him ill-will. This notwithstanding, they that procured\nhim this honour and dignity gave it out among the people that\nit was written in the Sybilline prophecies, 'how the Romans\nmight overcome the Parthians, if they made war with them and\n\n\nwere led by a king, but otherwise that they were unconquerable.'\nAnd furthermore they were so bold besides, that, Caesar returning\nto Rome from the city of Alba, when they came to salute\nhim, they called him king. But the people being offended, and\nCaesar also angry, he said he was not called king, but Caesar.\nThen every man keeping silence, he went his way heavy and\nsorrowful. When they had decreed divers honours for him in\nthe Senate, the Consuls and Praetors, accompanied with the\nwhole assembly of the Senate, went unto him in the marketplace,\nwhere he was set by the pulpit for orations, to tell him\nwhat honours they had decreed for him in his absence. But he,\nsitting still in his majesty, disdaining to rise up unto them when\nthey came in, as if they had been private men, answered them:\n'that his honours had more need to be cut off than enlarged.'\nThis did not only offend the Senate but the common people also,\nto see that he should so lightly esteem of the magistrates of the\ncommonwealth: insomuch as every man that might lawfully\ngo his way departed thence very sorrowfully. Thereupon also\nCaesar rising departed home to his house, and tearing open his\ndoublet-collar, making his neck bare, he cried out aloud to his\nfriends, 'that his throat was ready to offer to any man that\nwould come and cut it.' Notwithstanding it is reported, that\nafterwards, to excuse his folly, he imputed it to his disease,\nsaying, 'that their wits are not \n\n                   which have this disease of\nthe \n\n                  , when standing on their feet they speak to the\ncommon people, but are soon troubled with a trembling of their\nbody, and a sudden dimness and giddiness.' But that was not\ntrue, for he would have risen up to the Senate, but Cornelius\nBalbus one of his friends (or rather a flatterer) would not let\nhim, saying: \"What, do you not remember that you are\nCaesar, and will you not let them reverence you and do their\nduties?\"\n\n\n                   Besides these \n\n                   and offences, there followed\nalso his shame and reproach, abusing the tribunes of the people\nin this sort. At that time the feast  was celebrated,\nthe which in old time men say was the feast of shepherds or\nherdmen, and is much like unto the feast of the Lycaens in\nArcadia. But howsoever it is, that day there are divers noblemen's\nsons, young men, (and some of them magistrates themselves\nthat govern then), which run naked through the city,\nstriking in sport them they meet in their way with leather\nthongs, hair and all on, to make them \n\n                  . And many,\n\n\nnoblewomen and gentlewomen also go of purpose to stand in\ntheir way, and do put forth their hands to be stricken, as scholars\nhold them out to their schoolmaster to be stricken with the\n\n\n                  : persuading themselves that, being with child, they shall\nhave good delivery; and so, being barren, that it will make them\nto conceive with child. Caesar sat to behold that sport upon\nthe pulpit for orations, in a chain of gold, apparelled in triumphant\nmanner. Antonius, who was Consul at that time, was\none of them that ran this holy course. So when he came into\nthe market-place, the people made a lane for him to run at\nliberty, and he came to Caesar, and presented him a diadem\nwreathed about with laurel. Whereupon there rose a certain\ncry of rejoicing, not very great, done only by a few appointed\nfor the purpose. But when Caesar refused the diadem, then all\nthe people together made an outcry of joy. Then Antonius\noffering it him again, there was a second shout of joy, but yet of\na few. But when Caesar refused it again the second time, then\nall the whole people shouted. Caesar having made this proof,\nfound that the people did not like of it, and thereupon rose out\nof his chair, and commanded the crown to be earned unto\nJupiter in the Capitol. After that, there were set up images of\nCaesar in the city, with diadems upon their heads like kings.\nThose the two tribunes, Flavius and Marullus, went and\npulled down, and furthermore, meeting with them that first saluted\nCaesar as king, they committed them to prison. The people\nfollowed them rejoicing at it, and called them Brutes, because\nof Brutus, who had in old time driven the kings out of Rome,\nand that brought the kingdom of one person unto government\nof the Senate and people. Caesar was so offended withal,\nthat he deprived Marullus and Flavius of their tribuneships,\nand accusing them, he spake also against the people, and called\nthem Bruti and Cumani, to wit, beasts and fools.\n\n\n                    Hereupon the people went straight unto Marcus Brutus,\nwho from his father came of the first Brutus, and by his mother\nof the house of the Servilians, a noble house as any was in\nRome, and was also nephew and son-in-law of Marcus Cato.\nnotwithstanding, the great honours and favour Caesar shewed\nunto him kept him back that of himself alone he did not conspire\nnor consent to depose him of his kingdom. For Caesar\ndid not only save his life after the battle of Pharsalia, when\nPompey fled, and did at his request also save many \n\n                   of\nhis friends besides: but furthermore, he put a marvellous confidence \n\nin him. For he had already preferred him to the Praetorship\nfor that year, and furthermore was appointed to be Consul\nthe fourth year after that, having through Caesar's friendship\nobtained it before Cassius, who likewise made suit for the\nsame: and Caesar also, as it is reported, said in this contention,\n\"indeed Cassius hath alleged best reason, but yet shall he not be\nchosen before Brutus.\" Some one day accusing Brutus while\nhe \n\n                   this conspiracy, Caesar would not hear of it, but,\nclapping his hand on his body, told them, \"Brutus will look for\nthis skin :\" meaning thereby, that Brutus for his virtue deserved\nto rule after him, but yet that, for ambition's sake, he would not\nshew himself unthankful or dishonourable. Now they that\ndesired change, and wished Brutus only their prince and governor\nabove all other, they durst not come to him themselves to\ntell him what they would have him to do, but in the night did\ncast sundry papers into the Praetor's seat, where he gave audience,\nand the most of them to this effect: \"Thou sleepest,\nBrutus, and art not Brutus indeed.\" Cassius, finding Brutus'\nambition stirred up the more by these seditious \n\n                  , did \n\n                  \nhim forward and \n\n                   the more, for a private quarrel\nhe had conceived against Caesar: the circumstance whereof we\nhave set down more at large in Brutus' life. Caesar also had\nCassius in great jealousy, and suspected him much: whereupon\nhe said on a time to his friends, \"what will Cassius do, think\nye? I like not his pale looks.\" Another time when Caesar's\nfriends complained unto him of Antonius and Dolabella, that\nthey \n\n                   some mischief towards him: he answered them\nagain, \"As for those fat men and smooth-combed heads,' quoth\nhe, \" l never reckon of them; but these pale-visaged and carrionlean\npeople, I fear them most,\" meaning Brutus and Cassius.\n\n\n                   Certainly destiny may easier be foreseen than avoided,\nconsidering the strange and wonderful signs that were said to be\nseen before Caesar's death. For, touching the fires in the \n\n                  ,\nand spirits running up and down in the night, and also\nthe solitary birds to be seen at noondays sitting in the great\nmarket-place, are not all these signs perhaps worth the noting,\nin such a wonderful chance as happened? But Strabo the philosopher\nwriteth, that divers men were seen going up and down\nin fire: and furthermore, that there was a slave of the soldiers\nthat did cast a marvellous burning flame out of his hand, insomuch\nas they that saw it thought he had been burnt; but when\nthe fire was out, it was found he had no hurt. Caesar \n\n                   also\n\ndoing sacrifice unto the gods, found that one of the beasts\nwhich was sacrificed had no heart: and that was a strange thing\nin nature, how a beast could live without a heart. Furthermore\nthere was a certain soothsayer that had given Caesar warning\nlong time afore, to take heed of the day of the Ides of March,\n(which is the fifteenth of the month), for on that day he should\nbe in great danger. That day being come, Caesar going unto\nthe Senate-house, and speaking merrily unto the soothsayer,\ntold him, \"the Ides of March be come :\" \" so they be,\" softly\nanswered the soothsayer, \" but yet are they not past.\" And the\nvery day before, Caesar, supping with Marcus Lepidus, sealed\ncertain letters, as he was wont to do, at the board: so, talk falling\nout amongst them, reasoning what death was best, he, \n\n                  \ntheir opinions, cried out aloud, \" death unlooked for.\"\nThen going to bed the same night, as his manner was, and\nlying with his wife Calpurnia, all the windows and doors of his\nchamber flying open, the noise awoke him, and made him\nafraid when he saw such light: but more, when he heard his\nwife Calpurnia, being fast asleep, weep and sigh, and put forth\nmany \n\n                   lamentable speeches: for she dreamed that\nCaesar was slain, and that she had him in her arms. Others\nalso do deny that she had any such dream, as, amongst other,\nTitus Livius writeth that it was in this sort: the Senate having\nset upon the top of Caesar's house, for an ornament and \n\n                   a of the same, a certain pinnacle, Calpurnia dreamed that\nshe saw it broken down, and that she thought she lamented\nand wept for it. Insomuch that, Caesar rising in the morning,\nshe prayed him, if it were possible, not to go out of the doors\nthat day, but to adjourn the session of the Senate until another\nday. And if that he made no reckoning of her dream, yet that\nhe would search further of the soothsayers by their sacrifices,\nto know what should happen him that day. Thereby it seemed\nthat Caesar likewise did fear or suspect somewhat, because his\nwife Calpurnia until that time was never given to any fear and\nsuperstition: and that then he saw her so troubled in mind\nwith this dream she had. But much more afterwards, when the\nsoothsayers having sacrificed many beasts one after another,\ntold him that none did \n\n                   them: then he determined to send\nAntonius to adjourn the session of the Senate.\n\n\n                  \n                  But in the mean time came Decius Brutus, surnamed\nAlbinus, in whom Caesar put such confidence, that in his last\nwill and testament he had appointed him to be his next heir,\n\n\nand yet was of the conspiracy with Cassius and Brutus: he,\nfearing that if Caesar did adjourn the session that day, the conspiracy\nwould be betrayed, laughed at the soothsayers, and\nreproved Caesar, saying, \" that he gave the Senate occasion to\nmislike with him, and that they might think he mocked them,\nconsidering that by his commandment they were assembled,\nand that they were ready willingly to grant him all things, and\nto proclaim him king of all his provinces of the Empire of\nRome out of Italy, and that he should wear his diadem in all\nother places both by sea and land. And furthermore, that if\nany man should tell them from him they \n\n                   depart for\nthat present time, and return again when Calpurnia should have\nbetter dreams, what would his enemies and \n\n                   say, and\nhow could they \n\n                   his friends' words? And who could\npersuade them otherwise, but that they would think his dominion\na slavery unto them and tyrannical in himself? And yet if\nit be so,\" said he, \"that you utterly \n\n                   of this day, it is\nbetter that you go yourself in person, and, saluting the Senate,\nto dismiss them till another time.\" Therewithal he took Caesar\nby the hand, and brought him out of his house. Caesar was not\ngone far from his house, but a bond-man, a stranger, did what\nhe could to speak with him: and when he saw he was put\nback by the great press and multitude of people that followed\nhim, he went straight into his house, and put himself into Calpurnia's\nhands, to be kept till Caesar came back again, telling\nher that he had greater matters to impart unto him. \n\nAnd one\nArtemidorus also, born in the isle of Cnidos, a doctor of rhetoric\nin the Greek tongue, who by means of his profession was\nvery familiar with certain of Brutus' confederates, and therefore\nknew the most part of all their \n\n                   against Caesar,\ncame and brought him a little \n\n                  , written with his own hand,\nof all that he meant to tell him. He, marking how Caesar received\nall the supplications that were offered him, and that he\ngave them \n\n                   to his men that were about him, pressed\nnearer to him, and said: \" Caesar, read this memorial to yourself,\nand that quickly, for they be matters of great weight, and\ntouch you nearly.\" Caesar took it of him, but could never read\nit, though he many times attempted it, for the number of people\nthat did salute him: but holding it still in his hand, keeping\nit to himself, went on withal into the Senate-house. Howbeit\nothers are of opinion, that it was some man else that gave him\nthat memorial, and not Artemidorus, who did what he could\n\n\nall the way as he went to give it Caesar, but he was always\nrepulsed by the people. \n\nFor these things, they may seem to\ncome by chance; but the place where the \n\n                   was prepared,\nand where the Senate were assembled, and where also\nthere stood up an image of Pompey dedicated by himself\namongst other ornaments which he gave unto the theatre, all\nthese were manifest proofs, that it was the ordinance of some\ngod that made this treason to be executed, specially in that\nvery place. It is also reported, that Cassius (though otherwise\nhe did favour the doctrine of Epicurus) beholding the image of\nPompey, before they entered into the action of their traitorous\nenterprise, he did softly call upon it to aid him: but the instant\ndanger of the present time, taking away his former reason,\ndid suddenly put him into a furious passion, and made him\nlike a man half \n\n                   himself. Now Antonius, that was a\nfaithful friend to Caesar, and a valiant man besides of his hands,\nhim Decius Brutus Albinus entertained out of the Senate-house,\nhaving begun a long tale of set purpose. So Caesar coming\ninto the house, all the Senate stood up on their feet to do him\nhonour. Then part of Brutus' company and confederates stood\nround about Caesar's chair, and part of them also came towards\nhim, as though they made suit with Metellus Cimber, to call\nhome his brother again from banishment: and thus prosecuting\nstill their suit, they followed Caesar till he was set in his chair.\nWho denying their petitions, and being offended with them\none after another, because the more they were denied the more\nthey pressed upon him and were the earnester with him, Metellus\nat length, taking his gown with both his hands, pulled it\nover his neck, which was the sign given the confederates to\nset upon him. Then Casca, behind him, \n\n                   him in the\nneck with his sword; howbeit the wound was not great nor\nmortal, because it seemed the fear of such a devilish attempt\ndid amaze him and take his strength from him, that he killed\nhim not at the first blow. But Caesar, turning straight unto\nhim, caught hold of his sword and held it hard; and they both\ncried out, Caesar in Latin: \" O vile traitor Casca, what doest\nthou?\" and Casca, in Greek, to his brother: \"Brother, help\nme.\" At the beginning of this stir, they that were present, not\nknowing of the conspiracy, were so amazed with the horrible\nsight they saw, they had no power to fly, neither to help him,\nnor so much as once to make an outcry. They on the other side\nthat had conspired his death compassed him in on every side with\n\n\ntheir swords drawn in their hands, that Caesar turned him no where\nbut he was stricken at by some, and still had naked swords in\nhis face, and was \n\n                   and mangled among them, as a wild\nbeast taken \n\n                   hunters. For it was agreed among them that\nevery man should give him a wound, because all their parts\nshould be in this \n\n                  : and then Brutus himself gave him\none wound about his privities. Men report also, that Caesar\ndid still defend himself against the rest, running every way with\nhis body: but when he saw Brutus with his sword drawn in his\nhand, then he pulled his gown over his head, and made no more\nresistance, and was driven either casually or \n\n                  , by the\ncounsel of the conspirators, against the base whereupon Pompey's\nimage stood, which ran all \n\n                   a gore-blood till he was\nslain. Thus it seemed that the image took just revenge of\nPompey's enemy, being thrown down on the ground at his feet,\nand yielding up the ghost there, for the number of wounds he had\nupon him. For it is reported, that he had three and twenty\nwounds upon his body: and divers of the conspirators did hurt\nthemselves, striking one body with so many blows.\n\n\n                   When Caesar was slain, the Senate (though Brutus\nstood in the \n\n                   amongst them, as though he would have\nsaid something touching this \n\n                  ) presently ran out of the house,\nand flying, filled all the city with marvellous fear and tumult.\nInsomuch as some did shut to the doors, others forsook their\nshops and warehouses, and others ran to the place to see what\nthe matter was: and others also that had seen it ran home to\ntheir houses again. But Antonius and Lepidus, which were two\nof Caesar's chiefest friends, secretly conveying themselves away,\nfled into other men's houses and forsook their own. Brutus\nand his confederates on the other side, being yet hot with this\n\n\n                   they had committed, having their swords drawn in\ntheir hands, came all in a troup together out of the Senate and\nwent into the market-place, not as men that made countenance\nto fly, but otherwise boldly holding up their heads like men of\ncourage, and called to the people to defend their liberty, and\nstayed to speak with every great personage whom they met\nin their way. Of them, some followed this troup and went\namongst them, as if they had been of the conspiracy, and falsely\n\n\n                   part of the honour with them: amongst them was\nCaius Octavius and Lentulus Spinther. But both of them were\nafterwards put to death for their vain covetousness of honour,\nby Antonius and Octavius Caesar the younger; and yet had no\n\n\npart of that honour for the which they were both put to death,\nneither did any man believe that they were any of the confederates\nor of counsel with them. For they that did put them to\ndeath took revenge rather of the will they had to offend than of\nany \n\n                   they had committed. The next morning, Brutus and\nhis confederates came into the market-place to speak unto the\npeople, who gave them such audience, that it seemed they\nneither greatly reproved nor \n\n                   the \n\n                  : for by their great\nsilence they shewed that they were sorry for Caesar's death, and\nalso that they did reverence Brutus. Now the Senate granted\ngeneral pardon for all that was past; and, to pacify every man,\nordained besides, that Caesar's funerals should be honoured as\na god, and established all things that he had done, and gave\ncertain provinces also and convenient honours unto Brutus and\nhis confederates, whereby every man thought all things were\nbrought to good peace and quietness again. \n\nBut when they\nhad opened Caesar's \n\n                  , and found a liberal legacy of\nmoney bequeathed unto every citizen of Rome, and that they\nsaw his body (which was brought into the market-place) all \n\n                  \nwith gashes of swords, then there was no order to keep\nthe multitude and common people quiet, but they plucked up\nforms, tables, and stools, and laid them all about the body, and\nsetting them afire, burnt the corset Then when the fire was\nwell kindled, they took the fire-brands, and went unto their\nhouses that had slain Caesar, to set them afire. \n\n                   also ran\nup and down the city to see if they could meet with any of them,\nto cut them in pieces: howbeit they could meet with never a\nman of them, because they had locked themselves up safely in\ntheir houses. There was one of Caesar's friends called Cinna,\nthat had a marvellous strange and terrible dream the night before.\nHe dreamed that Caesar \n\n                   him to supper, and that he\nrefused and would not go: then that Caesar took him by the\nhand, and led him against his will. Now Cinna, hearing at\nthat time that they burnt Caesar's body in the market-place, notwithstanding\nthat he feared his dream, and had an ague on him\nbesides, he went into the market-place to honour his funerals.\nWhen he came thither, one of the \n\n                   asked him what\nhis name was? He was straight called by his name. The first\nman told it to another, and that other unto another, so that it\nran \n\n                   through them all, that he was one of them that\n\n\n                   Caesar: (for indeed one of the traitors to Caesar was\nalso called Cinna as himself) wherefore taking him for Cinna\n\n\nthe \n\n                  , they fell upon him with such fury that they \n\n                  \ndispatched him in the market-place. This stir and fury\nmade Brutus and Cassius more afraid than of all that was past,\nand therefore within few days after they departed out of Rome:\nand touching their doings afterwards, and what calamity they\nsuffered till their deaths, we have written it at large in the life of\nBrutus. \n\n                  Caesar died at six and fifty years of age, and Pompey\nalso lived not passing four years more than he. So he reaped\nno other fruit of all his reign and dominion, which he had so\nvehemently desired all his life and pursued with such extreme\ndanger, but a vain name only and a superficial glory, that procured\nhim the envy and hatred of his country.\n\n \n                  But his great prosperity and good fortune that favoured\nhim all his lifetime, did continue afterwards in the revenge of\nhis death, pursuing the \n\n                   both by sea and land, till\nthey had not left a man more to be executed, of all them that\nwere actors or counsellers in the conspiracy of his death. Furthermore,\nof all the chances that happen unto men upon the\nearth, that which came to Cassius above all other, is most to be\nwondered at: for he, being overcome in battle at the journey of\nPhilippes, slew himself with the same sword with the which he\n\n\n                   Caesar. Again, of signs in the \n\n                  , the great\ncomet, which seven nights together was seen very bright after\nCaesar's death, the eighth night after was never seen more. Also\nthe brightness of the sun was darkened, the which all that year\nthrough rose very pale and \n\n                   not out, whereby it gave\nbut small heat: therefore the air being very cloudy and dark,\nby the weakness of the heat that could not come forth, did cause\nthe earth to bring forth but raw and unripe fruit, which rotted\nbefore it could \n\n                  . But above all, the ghost that appeared\nunto Brutus shewed plainly, that the gods were offended with\nthe \n\n                   of Caesar. The vision was thus: Brutus being\nready to pass over his army from the city of Abydos to the\nother coast lying directly against it, slept every night (as his\nmanner was) in his tent; and being yet awake, thinking of his\naffairs (for by report he was as careful a captain and lived with\nas little sleep as ever man did) he thought he heard a noise at\nhis tent-door, and looking towards the light of the lamp that\nwaxed very dim, he saw a horrible vision of a man, of a wonderful\ngreatness and dreadful look, which at the first made him marvellously\nafraid. But when he saw that it did him no hurt, but\nstood by his bed-side and said nothing; at length he asked\n\n\nhim what he was. The image answered him: \"I am thy ill\nangel, Brutus, and thou shalt see me by the city of Philippes.\"\nThen Brutus replied again, and said, \"Well, I shall see thee\nthen.\" Therewithal the spirit \n\n                   vanished from him.\nAfter that time Brutus, being in battle near unto the city of\nPhilippes against Antonius and Octavius Caesar, at the first\nbattle he \n\n                   the victory, and overthrowing all them that\nwithstood him, he \n\n                   them into young Caesar's camp, which\nhe took. The second battle being at hand, this spirit appeared\nagain unto him, but spake never a word. Thereupon Brutus,\nknowing that he should die, did put himself to all hazard in\nbattle, but yet fighting could not be slain. So seeing his men\nput to flight and overthrown, he ran unto a little rock not\nfar off, and there setting his sword's point to his breast, fell\nupon it and slew himself; but yet, as it is reported, with the\nhelp of his friend that despatched him."}}}, {"@n": "Brut.", "front": {"div": {"@type": "toc", "pb": {"@n": "105"}, "head": "The Life of Marcus Brutus", "list": {"@type": "simple", "item": [{"ref": {"@n": "para. 1", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "I.

But that Junius Brutus, being of a sour\nstern nature not softened by reason, being like unto swordblades of too hard a temper, was so subject to his choler and\nmalice he bare unto the tyrants, that for their sakes he caused\nhis own sons to be executed. But this Marcus Brutus in contrary manner, whose life we presently write, having framed his\nmanners of life by the rules of virtue and study of philosophy,\nand having employed his wit, which was gentle and constant, in\n\n attempting of great things, me thinks he was rightly made and\nframed unto virtue. So that his very enemies which wish him\nmost hurt, because of his conspiracy against Julius Caesar, if\nthere were any noble attempt done in all this conspiracy, they\nrefer it wholly unto Brutus; and all the cruel and violent acts\nunto Cassius, who was Brutus' familiar friend, but not so well\n\n                   and conditioned as he. His mother Servilia, it is thought,\ncame of the blood of Servilius Hala; who, when Spurius Melius\nwent \n                   to make himself king, and, to bring it to pass, had\nenticed the common people to rebel, took a dagger and hid it\nclose under his arm, and went into the market-place. When he\nwas come thither, he made as though he had somewhat to say\nunto him, and pressed as near him as he could: wherefore\nMelius stooping down with his head to hear what he would say,\nServilius stabbed him in with his dagger and slew him. Thus\nmuch all writers agree \n                  his mother. Now touching his father,\nsome, for the evil will and malice they bare unto Brutus, because\nof the death of Julius Caesar, do maintain, that he came not of\nJunius Brutus that drave out the Tarquins: for there were none\nleft of his race, considering that his two sons were executed for\nconspiracy with the Tarquins; and that Marcus Brutus came of\na mean house, the which was raised to honour and office in the\ncommon-wealth but of late time. Posidonius the Philosopher\nwriteth the contrary, that Junius Brutus indeed slew two of his\nsons which were men grown, as the histories do declare; howbeit that there was a third son, being but a little child at that\ntime, from whom the house and family afterwards was derived:\nand furthermore, that there were in his time certain famous men\nof that family, whose stature and countenance resembled much\nthe image of Junius Brutus. And thus much for this matter:\n\n\nMarcus Cato the philosopher was brother unto Servilia, Marcus\nBrutus' mother: whom Brutus studied most to follow of all the\nother Romans, because he was his uncle, and afterwards he\nmarried his daughter.\n\n \n                  Now touching the Grecian philosophers, there was no\nsect nor philosopher of them, but he heard and liked it: but\nabove all the rest he loved Plato's sect best, and did not much\ngive himself to the new or mean Academy (as they call it), but\naltogether to the old Academy. Therefore he did ever greatly\nesteem the philosopher Antiochus, of the city of Ascalon: but he\nwas more familiar with his brother Ariston, who for learning and\nknowledge was inferior to many other philosophers, but for\n\nwisdom and courtesy equal with the best and chiefest. Touching\nEmpylus, whom M. Brutus himself doth mention in his Epistles,\nand his friends also in many places, he was an orator, and left\nan excellent book he wrote of the death of Julius Caesar, and entitled it \"Brutus\". He was \n                   learned in the Latin\ntongue, and was able to make long discourse in it: beside that\nhe could also plead very well in Latin. But for the Greek tongue,\nthey do note in some of his epistles, that he counterfeited that\nbrief compendious manner of speech of the Lacedaemonians.\nAs, when the war was begun, he wrote unto the Pergamenians\nin this sort: \"I understand you have given Dolabella money:\nif you have done it willingly, you confess you have offended\nme; if against your wills, shew it then by giving me willingly.\"\nAnother time again unto the Samians: \"Your councils be long,\nyour doings be slow, consider the end.\" And in another Epistle\nhe wrote \n                  : \"The Xanthians, despising my\ngoodwill, have made their country a grave of despair; and the\nPatareians, that put themselves into my protection, have lost no\njot of their liberty: and therefore, whilst you have liberty, either\nchoose the judgment of the Patareians, or the fortune of the\nXanthians.\" These were Brutus' manner of letters, which were\nhonoured for their briefness.\n\n\n                   \n                  So Brutus, being but a young stripling, went into Cyprus\nwith his uncle Cato, who was sent against Ptolemy, king of\nEgypt; who having slain himself, Cato, staying for certain necessary business he had in the \n                   of Rhodes, had already sent\n\n                  , one of his friends, before, to keep his treasure and\ngoods. But Cato, fearing he would be light-fingered, wrote unto\nBrutus forthwith to come out of Pamphilia (where he was but\nnewly recovered of a sickness) into Cyprus; the which he did.\nThe which journey he was sorry to take upon him both for respect of Caninius' shame, whom Cato (as he thought) wrongfully\nslandered: as also because he thought this office too mean and\nunmeet for him, being a young man, and given to his book.\nThis notwithstanding, he behaved himself so honestly and carefully, that Cato did greatly commend him: and after all the\ngoods were sold and converted into ready money, he took the\nmost part of it, and returned withal to Rome. \n\nAfterwards,\nwhen the empire of Rome was divided into factions, and that\nCaesar and Pompey both were in arms one against the other;\nand that all the empire of Rome was in \n                   and uproar:\nit was thought then that Brutus would take part with Caesar,\n\nbecause Pompey not long before had put his father to death. But\nBrutus, preferring the respect of his country and commonwealth\nbefore private affection, and persuading himself that Pompey\nhad juster cause to enter into arms than Caesar, he then took\npart with Pompey; though oftentimes meeting him before, he\nthought scorn to speak to him, thinking it a great sin and offence\nin him, to speak to the \n                   of his father. But then, submitting himself unto Pompey as unto the head of the commonwealth, he sailed into Sicily, lieutenant under Sestius that was\ngovernor of that province. But when he saw that there was no\nway to rise, nor to do any noble exploits, and that Caesar and\nPompey were both camped together, and fought for victory: he\nwent of himself, unsent for, into Macedon, to be partaker of the\ndanger. It is reported that Pompey, being glad, and wondering\nat his coming, when he saw him come to him, he rose out of his\nchair, and went and embraced him before them all, and used him\nas honorably as he could have done the noblest man that took\nhis part. Brutus, being in Pompey's camp, did nothing but study\nall day long, except he were with Pompey; and not only the\ndays before, but the self-same day also before the great battle\nwas fought in the fields of Pharsalia, where Pompey was overcome. It was in the midst of summer, and the sun was very\nhot, besides that the camp was lodged near unto \n                  , and\nthey that carried his tent tarried long before they came: whereupon, being very weary with travel, \n                   any meat came into\nhis mouth at dinner-time. Furthermore,when others slept, or\nthought what would happen the morrow after, he fell to his book,\nand wrote all day long till night, writing a \n                   of Polybius.\n\n\n                   \n                  It is reported that Caesar did not forget him, and that he\ngave his captains charge before the battle, that they should beware they killed not Brutus in fight; and if he yielded willingly\nunto them, that then they should bring him unto him: but if he\nresisted and would not be taken, then that they should let him\ngo, and do him no hurt. Some say he did this for Servilia's\nsake, Brutus' mother. For when he was a young man, he had\nbeen acquainted with Servilia, who was extremely in love with\nhim. And because Brutus was born in that time when their\nlove was hottest, he persuaded himself that he begat him. For\nproof hereof the report goeth, that when the weightiest matters\nwere in hand in the Senate, about the conspiracy of Catiline,\nwhich was likely to have undone the city of Rome, Caesar and\nCato sat near together, and were both of contrary minds to each\n\n\nother: and then, that in the mean time one delivered Caesar a\nletter. Caesar took it, and read it softly to himself: but Cato\ncried out upon Caesar, and said he did not well to receive advertisements from enemies: whereupon the whole Senate began\nto murmur at it. Then Caesar gave Cato the letter as it was sent\nhim, who read it, and found that it was a love-letter sent from\nhis sister Servilia: thereupon he cast it again to Caesar, and said\nunto him; ''\n                  , drunken \n                  .\" When he had done so, he\nwent on with his tale, and maintained his opinion as he did before: so commonly was the love of Servilia known, which she\nbare unto Caesar. \n\n                  So, after Pompey's overthrow at the battle of\nPharsalia, and that he fled to the sea, when Caesar came to besiege his camp, Brutus went out of the camp-gates unseen of any\nman, and leapt into a \n                   full of water and reeds. Then\nwhen night was come, he crept out, and went unto the city of\nLarissa: from whence he wrote unto Caesar, who was very glad\nthat he had \n                  , and sent for him to come unto him. When\nBrutus was come, he did not only pardon him, but also kept him\nalways about him, and did as much honour and esteem him as\nany man he had in his company. Now no man could tell\nwhither Pompey was fled, and all were marvellous desirous to\nknow it: wherefore Caesar walking a good way alone with Brutus,\nhe did ask him which way he thought Pompey took. Caesar\nperceiving by his talk that Brutus guessed certainly whither\nPompey should be fled, he left all other ways, and took his\njourney directly towards Egypt. Pompey (as Brutus had conjectured) was indeed fled into Egypt, but there he was villanously slain. Furthermore, Brutus obtained pardon of Caesar\nfor Cassius; and defending \n                   of Lybia's cause, he\nwas overlaid with a world of accusations against him; howbeit,\nintreating for him, he saved him the best part of his realm and\nkingdom. They say also that Caesar said, when he heard\nBrutus plead: \"I know not,\" said he, \"what this young man\nwould; but what he would, he willeth it vehemently.\" For as\nBrutus' gravity and constant mind would not grant all men their\nrequests that sued unto him, but, being moved with reason and\ndiscretion, did always incline to that which was good and honest:\neven so, when it was moved to follow any matter, he used a kind\nof forcible and vehement persuasion, that calmed not till he had\nobtained his desire. For by flattering of him a man could\nnever obtain any thing at his hands, nor make him to do that\nwhich was unjust. Further, he thought it not meet for a man of\n\ncalling and estimation, to yield unto the requests and entreaties\nof a shameless and importunate suitor, requesting things unmeet:\nthe which notwithstanding some men do for shame, because they\ndare deny nothing: and therefore he was wont to say, \"That he\nthought them evil brought up in their youth, that could deny\nnothing.\"\n\n \n                  Now when Caesar took sea to go into Africa against Cato\nand Scipio, he left Brutus governor of Gaul in Italy on this\nside of the Alps, which was a great good hap for that province.\nFor where others were spoiled and \n                   by the insolency and\ncovetousness of the governors, as if it had been a country conquered, Brutus was a comfort and rest unto their former troubles\nand miseries they sustained. But he referred it wholly unto\nCaesar's grace and goodness. For when Caesar returned out of\nAfrica, and progressed up and down Italy, the things that\npleased him best to see were the cities under Brutus' charge and\ngovernment, and Brutus himself; who honoured Caesar in person,\nand whose company also Caesar greatly esteemed. \n\nNow there\nwere divers sorts of Praetorships in Rome, and it was looked\n\n                  , that Brutus or Cassius would make suit for the chiefest\nPraetorship, which they called the Praetorship of the city: because he that had that office was as a judge, to minister justice\nunto the citizens. Therefore they strove one against another:\nthough some say, that there was some little grudge betwixt them\nfor other matters before, and that this contention did set them\nfurther \n                  , though they  were allied together: for Cassius had\nmarried Junia, Brutus' sister. Others say that this contention\nbetwixt them came by Caesar himself, who secretly gave either\nof them both hope of his favour. So their suit for the Praetorship was so followed and laboured \n                   either party, that one of\nthem put another into suit of law. Brutus with his virtue and\ngood name contended against many noble exploits in arms,\nwhich Cassius had done against the Parthians. So Caesar after\nhe had heard both their objections, told his friends, with whom\nhe consulted about this matter: \"Cassius' cause is the juster,\"\nsaid he, \"but Brutus must be first preferred.\" Thus Brutus had\nthe first Praetorship, and Cassius the second: who thanked not\nCaesar so much for the Praetorship he had, as he was angry with\nhim for that he had lost. But Brutus in many other things\ntasted of the benefit of Cesar's favour in any thing he requested.\nFor if he had \n                  , he might have been one of Caesar's chiefest\nfriends, and of greatest authority and credit about him. Howbeit,\n\n\nCassius' friends did dissuade him from it (for Cassius and he\nwere not yet reconciled together \n                   their first contention and strife for the Praetorship), and prayed him to beware of\nCaesar's sweet enticements, and to fly his tyrannical favours:\nthe which they said Caesar gave him, not to honour his virtue,\nbut to weaken his constant mind, framing it to the bent of his\nbow.\n\n\n                   \n                  Now Caesar, on the other side, did not trust him overmuch, nor was without tales brought unto him against him:\nhowbeit he feared his great mind, authority, and friends. Yet,\non the other side also, he trusted his good nature and fair conditions. For, intelligence being brought him one day, that\nAntonius and Dolabella did conspire against him: he answered\n\"That these fat long-haired men made him not afraid, but the\nlean and whitely-faced fellows,\" meaning that \n                   Brutus and\nCassius.  At another time also when one accused Brutus unto\nhim, and bad him beware of him: \"What,\" said he again, clapping his hands on his breast, \" think ye that Brutus will not \ntarry\ntill this body die?\" meaning that none but Brutus after him was\nmeet to have such power as he had. And surely, (in my opinion) I am persuaded that Brutus might indeed have come to\nhave been the chiefest man of Rome, if he could have contented\nhimself for a time to have been next unto Caesar, and to have\nsuffered his glory and authority, which he had gotten by his\ngreat victories, to consume with time. But Cassius, being a\ncholeric man, and hating Caesar privately more than he did the\ntyranny openly, he incensed Brutus against him. It is also reported, that Brutus could evil away \n                   the tyranny, and that\nCassius hated the tyrant: making many complaints for the\ninjuries he had done him; and amongst others, for that he had\ntaken away his lions from him. Cassius had provided them\nfor his sports when he should be Aedilis; and they were found in\nthe city of Megara, when it was won by Calenus: and Caesar\nkept them. The rumour went, that these lions did marvellous\ngreat hurt to the Megarians: for when the city was taken, they\nbrake their cages where they were tied up and turned them loose,\nthinking they would have done great mischief to the enemies,\nand have kept them from setting upon them: but the lions (contrary to expectation) turned upon themselves that fled unarmed,\nand did so cruelly tear some in pieces, that it pitied their enemies\nto see them. \n\nAnd this was the cause (as some do report) that\nmade Cassius conspire against Caesar. But this holdeth no\n\n water: for Cassius, even from his cradle, could not abide any\nmanner of tyrants; as it appeared when he was but a boy, and\nwent unto the same school that Faustus the son of Sylla did.\nAnd Faustus, bragging among other boys, highly boasted of his\nfather's kingdom: Cassius rose up on his feet, and gave him two\ngood \n                   on the ear. Faustus' governors would have put this\nmatter in suit against Cassius: but Pompey would not suffer\nthem, but caused the two boys to be brought before him, and\nasked them how the matter came to pass. Then Cassius (as it\nis written of him) said unto the other: \"Go to, Faustus, speak\nagain, \n                   thou darest, before this nobleman here, the same\nwords that made me angry with thee, that my fists may walk\nonce again about shine ears.\" Such was Cassius' hot stirring\nnature. \n                  \n                   Brutus, his friends and countrymen, both by\ndivers procurements and sundry rumours of the city, and by\nmany \n                   also, did openly call and procure him to do that he\ndid. For under the image of his ancestor Junius Brutus, (that\ncrave the kings out of Rome) they wrote: \"O, that it pleased\nthe gods thou wert now alive, Brutus!\" and again, \"that \nthou\nwert here among us now!\" His tribunal or chair, where he\ngave audience during the time he was Praetor, was full of such\nbills4: \"Brutus, thou art asleep, and art not Brutus indeed.\"\nAnd of all this Caesar's flatterers were the cause: who, beside\nmany other exceeding and unspeakable honours they daily devised for him, in the night-time they put diadems upon the\nheads of his images, supposing thereby to allure the common\npeople to call him King, instead of Dictator. Howbeit it turned\nto the contrary, as we have written more at large in Julius\nCaesar's life.\n\n\n                   Now when Cassius felt his friends, and did stir them up\nagainst Caesar: they all agreed, and promised to take part with\nhim, \n                   Brutus were the chief of their conspiracy. For they\ntold him that so high an enterprise and attempt as that, did\nnot so much require men of manhood and courage to draw\ntheir swords, as it stood them . to have a man of such\nestimation as Brutus, to make every man boldly think, that by\nhis only \n                   the \n                   were holy and just. If he took\nnot this course, then that they should go to it with fainter\nhearts; and when they had done it, they should be more fearful: because every man would think that Brutus would not have\nrefused to have made one with them, if the cause had been good\nand honest. Therefore Cassius, considering this matter with\n\n\nhimself, did first of all speak to Brutus, since they grew \n                  \ntogether \n                   the suit they had for the praetorship. So when he \nwas reconciled to him again, and that they had embraced one\nanother, Cassius asked him if he were determined to be in the\nSenate-house the first day of the month of March, because he\nheard say that Caesar's friends should move the council that day,\nthat Caesar should be called king by the Senate. Brutus \nanswered him, he would not be there. \"But if we be sent for,\"\nsaid Cassius, \"how then?\" \"For myself then,\" said Brutus, \"I \nmean not to hold my peace, but to withstand it, and rather die\nthan lose my liberty.\" Cassius being bold, and taking hold of\nthis word: \"Why,\" quoth he, \"what Roman is he alive that\nwill suffer thee to die for thy liberty? What? knowest thou not\nthat thou art Brutus? Thinkest thou that they be cobblers, tapsters, or suchlike base \n                   people, that write these bills\nand scrolls which are found daily in thy praetor's chair, and not\nthe noblest men and best citizens that do it? No; be thou well\nassured that \n                   other praetors they look for gifts, common distributions amongst the people, and for common plays, and to\nsee fencers fight at the \n                  , to shew the people pastime: but \nat thy hands they specially require (as a due debt unto them) \nthe taking away of the tyranny, being fully bent to suffer any \nextremity for thy sake, so that thou wilt shew thyself to be the \nman thou art taken for, and that they hope thou art.\" There- \nupon he kissed Brutus and embraced him: and so each taking \nleave of other, they went both to speak with their friends about\nit. \n\nNow amongst Pompey's friends, there was one called \n                  \nLigarius, who had been accused unto Caesar for taking part\nwith Pompey, and Caesar \n                   him. But Ligarius thanked\nnot Caesar so much for his \n                  , as he was offended with\nhim for that he was brought in danger by his tyrannical power;\nand therefore in his heart he was always his mortal enemy, and\nwas besides very familiar with Bratus, who went to see him being sick in his bed, and said unto him: \"Ligarius, in what a\ntime art thou sick?\" Ligarius rising up in his bed, and taking\nhim by the right hand, said unto him: \"Brutus,\" said he, \" if\nthou hast any great enterprise in hand worthy of thyself, I\nam whole.\"\n\n\n                  After that time they began to feel all their acquaintance\nwhom they trusted, and laid their heads together, consulting\nupon it, and did not only pick out their friends, but all those also\nwhom they thought stout enough to attempt any desperate matter,\n\nand that were not afraid to lose their lives. For this cause\nthey durst not acquaint Cicero with their conspiracy, although\nhe was a man whom they loved dearly, and trusted best: for\nthey were afraid tbat he being a coward by nature, and age also\nhaving increased his fear, he would quite turn and alter all their\npurpose, and quench the heat of their enterprise, (the which\nspecially required hot and earnest execution), seeking by persuasion to bring all things to such safety, as there should be no\nperil. Brutus also did let other of his friends alone, as Statilius\nEpicurian, and Faonius, that made profession to follow Marcus\nCato: because that, having cast out words afar off, disputing together in philosophy to feel their minds, Faonius answered,\n'that civil war was worse than tyrannical government usurped\nagainst the law.' And Statilius told him also, 'that it were an\nunwise part for him to put his life in danger, for a sort of ignorant fools and asses.' Labeo was present at this talk and maintained the contrary against them both. But Brutus held his\npeace, as though it had been a doubtful matter, and a hard thing\nto have been decided. But afterwards, being out of their company, he made Labeo privy to his intent; who very readily\noffered himself to make one. And they thought good also to\nbring in another Brutus to join with him, surnamed Albinus:\nwho was no man of his \n                   himself, but because he was able\nto bring good force of a great number of slaves, and fencers at\nthe sharp, whom he kept to shew the people pastime with their\nfighting, besides also that Caesar had some trust in him.\nCassius and Labeo told Brutus Albinus of it at the first, but\nhe made them no answer. But when he had spoken with\nBrutus himself alone, and that Brutus had told him he was\nthe chief ringleader of all this conspiracy, then he willingly\npromised him the best aid he could. Furthermore, the \n                  \nname and great calling of Brutus did bring on the most of\nthem to give consent to this conspiracy: who having never\ntaken oaths together, nor taken or given any caution or assurance, nor binding themselves one to another by any religious\noaths, they all kept the matter so secret to themselves, and\ncould so cunningly handle it, that notwithstanding the gods\ndid reveal it by manifest signs and tokens from above, and\nby predictions of sacrifices, yet all this would not be believed.\n\n\nNow Brutus, who knew very well that for his sake all the\nnoblest, valiantest, and most courageous men of Rome did venture their lives, weighing with himself the greatness of the\n\n\ndanger: when he was out of his house, he did so frame and\nfashion his countenance and looks that no man could discern\nhe had anything to trouble his mind. But when night came\nthat he was in his own house, then he was clean changed: for\neither care did wake him against his will when he would have\nslept, or else oftentimes of himself he fell into such deep thoughts\nof this enterprise, casting in his mind all the dangers that might\nhappen: that his wife, Iying by him, found that there was some\nmarvellous great matter that troubled his mind, not being wont\nto be in that \n                  , and that he could not well determine with\nhimself.\n\n \n                  His wife Porcia (as we have told you before) was the\ndaughter of Cato, whom Brutus married being his cousin, not a\nmaiden, but a young widow after the death of her first husband\nBibulus, by whom she had also a young son called Bibulus, who\nafterwards wrote a book of the acts and \n                   of Brutus, extant\nat this present day. This young lady, being excellently well \n                  \nin philosophy, loving her husband well, and being of a noble\ncourage, as she was also wise: because she would not ask her\nhusband what he ailed before she had made some proof \n                   her\nself: she took a little razor, such as barbers \n                   to pare\nmen's nails, and, causing her maids and women to go out of her\nchamber, gave herself a great gash withal in her thigh, that she\nwas straight all of a gore \n                  : and \n                   after a\nvehement fever took her, by reason of the pain of her wound\n Then perceiving her husband was marvellously out of quiet, and\nthat he could take no rest, even in her greatest pain of all she\nspake in this sort unto him: \"I being, O Brutus,\" said she \"the\ndaughter of Cato, was married unto thee; not to be thy bed-fellow and companion in bed and at board only, like a harlot, but\nto be partaker also with thee of thy good and evil fortune. Now\nfor thyself, I can find no cause of fault in thee touching our\nmatch: but for my part, how may I shew my duty towards thee\nand how much I would do for thy sake, if I cannot \n                  \nbear a secret mischance or grief with thee, which requireth\nsecrecy and fidelity? I confess that a woman's wit commonly is\ntoo weak to keep a secret safely: but yet, Brutus, good education and the company of virtuous men have some power to\nreform the defect of nature. And for myself, I have this benefit\nmoreover, that I am the daughter of Cato, and wife of Brutus.\nThis notwithstanding, I did not trust to any of these things\nbefore, until that now I have found by experience that no pain\n\n or grief whatsoever can overcome me.\"With those words she\nshewed him her wound on her thigh, and told him what she had\ndone to prove herself. Brutus was amazed to hear what she\nsaid unto him, and lifting up his hands to heaven, he besought\nthe gods to give him the grace he might bring his enterprise\nto so good \n                  , that he might be found a husband worthy of so\nnoble a wife as Porcia: so he then did comfort her the best he\ncould.\n\n\n\n                   Now a day being appointed for the meeting of the\nSenate, at what time they hoped Caesar would not fail to come,\nthe conspirators determined then to put their enterprise in\nexecution, because they might meet safely at that time without suspicion; and the rather, for that all the noblest and chiefest men of the city would be there: who, when they should see\nsuch a great matter executed, would every man \n                   their\nhands, for the defence of their liberty. Furthermore they\nthought also, that the appointment of the place where the council should be kept was chosen of \n                   by divine providence,\nand made all for them. For it was one of the porches about the\ntheatre, in the which there was a certain place full of seats for\nmen to sit in; where also was set up the image of Pompey,\nwhich the city had made and consecrated in honour of \nhim,\nwhen he did beautify that part of the city with the theatre\nhe built, with divers porches about it. In this place was the\nassembly of the Senate appointed to be, just on the fifteenth\nday of the month IvIarch, which the Romans call \n:\nso that it seemed some god of \n                  had brought Caesar\nthither to be slain, for revenge of Pompey's death. So when the\nday was come, Brutus went out of his house with a dagger by\nhis side under his long gown, that nobody saw nor knew but\nhis wife only. The other conspirators were all assembled at\nCassius' house, to bring his son into the market-place, who on\nthat day did put on the man's gown, called  and\nfrom thence they came all in a troop together unto Pompey's\nporch, \n                   that Caesar would straight come thither. But\nhere is to be noted the wonderful assured constancy of these\nconspirators, in so dangerous and weighty an enterprise as they\nhad undertaken. For many of them being praetors, by reason\nof their office (whose duty is to minister justice to everybody)\ndid not only with great quietness and courtesy hear them that\nspake unto them, or that pleaded matters before them, and gave\nthem attentive ear as if they had no other matter in their heads:\n\n\nbut moreover they gave just sentence, and carefully despatched\nthe causes before them. So there was one among them, who,\nbeing condemned in a certain sum of money, refused to pay it,\nand cried out that he did appeal unto Caesar. Then Brutus,\ncasting his eyes upon the conspirators, said: \"Caesar shall not\n\n                   me to see the law executed.\" \n\n                  Notwithstanding this, by\nchance there fell out many misfortunes unto them, which was\nenough to have marred the enterprise. The first and chiefest\nwas Caesar's long tarrying, who came very late to the Senate:\nfor, because the signs of the sacrifices appeared unlucky, his\nwife Calphurnia kept him at home, and the soothsayers bade\nhim beware he went not abroad. The second cause was, when\none came unto Casca being a conspirator, and taking him by\nthe hand, said unto him: \" O Casca? thou keptest it close from\nme, but Brutus hath told me all.\" Casca being amazed at it,\nthe other went on with his tale, and said: \" Why, how now, how\ncometh it to pass thou art thus rich, that thou dost sue to be\nAedilis?\" Thus Casca being deceived by the other's doubtful\nwords, he told them it was a thousand to one, he blabbed not\nout all the conspiracy. Another Senator, called Popilius Laena,\nafter he had saluted Brutus and Cassius more friendly than he\nwas wont to do, he \n                   softly in their ears, and told them:\n\"I pray the gods you may go through with that you have taken\nin hand; but withal, despatch, I \n                   you, for your enterprise\nis \n                  .\" When he had said, he \n                   departed from\nthem, and left them both afraid that their conspiracy would out.\n\n \n                  Now in the meantime, there came one of Brutus' men\npost-haste unto him, and told him his wife was a-dying. For\nPorcia, being very \n                   and pensive for that which was to\ncome, and being too weak to away \n                   so great and inward\ngrief of mind, she could hardly keep within, but was frighted\nwith every little noise and cry she heard, as those that are taken\nand possessed with the fury of the Bacchantes; asking every\nman that came from the market-place what Brutus did, and\n\n                   sent messenger after messenger, to know what news. At\nlength Caesar's coming being prolonged (as you have heard),\nPorcia's weakness was not able to hold out any longer, and\nthereupon she suddenly \n                  , that she had no leisure to go\nto her chamber, but was taken in the midst of her house, where\nher speech and senses failed her. Howbeit she soon came to\nherself again, and so was laid in her bed, and attended by her\nwomen. When Brutus heard these news, it grieved him, as it is\n\n \nto be presupposed: yet he left not off the care of his country\nand commonwealth, neither went home to his house for any\nnews he heard.\n\n\n                   Now it was reported that Caesar was coming in his\nlitter: for he determined not to stay in the Senate all that day\n(because he was afraid of the unlucky signs of the sacrifices)\nbut to adjourn matters of importance unto the next session and\ncouncil holden, feigning himself not to be well at ease. When\nCaesar came out of his litter, Popilius Laena (that had talked\nbefore with Brutus and Cassius, and had prayed the gods they\nmight bring this enterprise to pass) went unto Caesar, and kept\nhim a long time with a talk. Caesar gave good ear unto him:\nwherefore the conspirators (if so they should be called) not\nhearing what he said to Caesar, but conjecturing by that he had\ntold them a little before that his talk was none other but the\nvery discovery of their conspiracy, they were afraid every man\nof them; and, one looking in another's face, it was easy to see\nthat they all were of a mind, that it was no tarrying for them\ntill they were apprehended, but rather that they should kill\nthemselves with their own hands. And when Cassius and certain\n\n                   clapped their hands on their swords under their gowns to\ndraw them, Brutus, marking the countenance and gesture of\nLaena, and considering that he did use himself rather like an\nhumble and earnest suitor than like an accuser, he said nothing\nto his companion (because there were many amongst them that\nwere not of the conspiracy), but with a pleasant countenance\nencouraged Cassius. And immediately afier Laena vent from\nCaesar, and kissed his hand; which shewed plainly that it was\nfor some matter concerning himself that he had held him so\nlong in talk.\n\nNow all the Senators being entered first into this\nplace or chapter-house where the council should be kept, all the\nother conspirators straight stood about Caesar's chair, as if they\nhad had something to say unto him. And some say that Cassius,\ncasting his eyes upon Pompey's image, made his prayer unto it,\nas if it had been alive. \n                   on the other side drew\nAntonius aside, as he came into the house where the Senate sat,\nand held him with a long talk without. When Caesar was come\ninto the house, all the Senate rose to honour him at his coming\nin. So when he was set, the conspirators flocked about him,\nand amongst them they presented one \n                   who\nmade humble suit for the calling home again of his brother that\nwas banished. They all made as though they were intercessors\n\n\nfor him, and took Caesar by the hands, and kissed his head and\nbreast. Caesar at the first simply refused their kindness and\nentreaties; but afterwards, perceiving they still pressed on him,\nhe violently thrust them from him. Then Cimber with both his\nhands plucked Caesar's gown over his shoulders, and Casca, that\nstood behind him, drew his dagger first and strake Caesar upon\nthe shoulder, but gave him no great wound. Caesar, feeling himself hurt, took him straight by the hand he held his dagger in,\nand cried out in Latin: \"O traitor Casca, what dost thou?\"\nCasca on the other side cried in Greek, and called his brother\nto help him. So divers running on a heap together to fly upon\nCaesar, he, looking about him to have fled, saw Brutus with a\nsword drawn in his hand ready to strike at him: then he let\nCasca's hand go, and casting his gown over his face, suffered\nevery man to strike at him that would. Then the conspirators\nthronging one upon another, because every man was desirous to \nhave a cut at him, so many swords and daggers lighting upon \none body, one of them hurt another, and among them Brutus \ncaught a blow on his hand, because he would make one in\nmurthering of him, and all the rest also were every man of them\n\n                  .\n\n\n                   Caesar being slain in this manner, Brutus, standing in\nthe \n                   of the house, would have spoken, and stayed the\nother Senators that were not of the conspiracy, to have told\nthem the reason why they had done this \n                  . But they, as\nmen both afraid and amazed, fled one upon another's neck in\nhaste to get out at the door, and no man followed them. For it\nwas set down and agreed between them, that they should kill\nno man but Caesar only, and should \n                   all the rest to look\nto defend their liberty. All the conspirators, but Brutus, determining upon this matter, thought it good also to kill Antonius,\nbecause he was a wicked man, and that in nature favoured\ntyranny: besides also, for that he was in great estimation with\nsoldiers, having been conversant of long time amongst them:\nand especially having a mind bent to great enterprises, he was\nalso of great authority at that time, being Consul with Caesar.\nBut Brutus would not agree to it. First, for that he said it was\nnot \n                  : secondly, because he told them there was hope of\nchange in him. For he did not mistrust but that Antonius,\nbeing a noble-minded and courageous man, (when he should\nknow that Caesar was dead), would willingly help his country to\nrecover her liberty, having them an example unto him to follow\n\ntheir courage and virtue. So Brutus by this means saved Antonius' life, who at that present time disguised himself and\nstole away: but Brutus and his consorts, having their swords\nbloody in their hands, went straight to the Capitol, persuading\nthe Romans as they went to take their liberty again. Now at\nthe first time, when the \n                    was newly done, there were sudden outcries of people that ran up and down the city, the which\nindeed did the more increase the fear and tumult. But when\nthey saw they slew no man, neither did spoil or make havoc of\nanything, then certain of the Senators and many of the people,\nemboldening themselves, went to the Capitol unto them.\n\n  There, a great number of men being assembled together\none after another, Brutus made an oration unto them, to win\nthe favour of the people, and to justify that they had done. All\nthose that were by said they had done well, and cried unto\nthem that they should boldly come down from the Capitol:\nwhereupon Brutus and his companions came boldly down into\nthe market-place. The rest followed in \n                  , but Brutus went\nforemost, very honourably compassed in round about with the\nnoblest men of the city, which brought him from the Capitol,\nthrough the market-place, to the pulpit for orations. When the\npeople saw him in the pulpit, although they were a multitude of\n\n                   of all sorts, and had a good will to make some stir;\nyet, being ashamed to do it, for the reverence they bare unto\nBrutus, they kept silence to hear what he would say. When\nBrutus began to speak, they gave him quiet audience: howbeit.\nimmediately after, they shewed that they were not all contented\nwith the murtherl. For when another, called Cinna, would have\nspoken, and began to accuse Caesar, they fell into a great uproar\namong them, and marvellously reviled him; insomuch that the\nconspirators returned again into the Capitol. There Brutus,\nbeing afraid to be besieged, sent back again the noblemen that\ncame thither with him, thinking it no reason that they, which\nwere no partakers of the \n                  , should be partakers of the\ndanger. \n\nThen the next morning, the Senate being assembled,\nand holden within the temple of the goddess Tellus, to wit, the\nEarth: and Antonius, Plancus, and Cicero, having made a\nmotion to the Senate in that assembly that they should take an\norder to pardon and forget all that was past, and to establish\nfriendship and peace again: it was decreed, that they should not\nonly be pardoned, but also that the Consuls should refer it to\nthe Senate, what honours should be appointed unto them. This\n\n\nbeing agreed upon, the Senate brake up; and Antonius the\nConsul, to put them in heart that were in the Capitol, sent them\nhis son for a pledge. Upon this assurance, Brutus and his companions came down from the Capitol, where every man saluted\nand embraced each other; among the which Antonius himself\ndid \n                   Cassius to supper to him, and Lepidus also bade Brutus;\nand so one bade another, as they had friendship and acquaintance together.\n\n The next day following, the Senate, being called again\nto council, did first of all commend Antonius, for that he had\nwisely \n                   and quenched the beginning of a civil war: then\nthey also gave Brutus and his consorts great praises; and lastly\nthey appointed them several governments of Provinces. For\nunto Brutus they appointed Creta; Africa unto Cassius; Asia\nunto Trebonius; Bithynia unto Cimber; and unto the other,\nDecius Brutus Albinus, Gaul on this side of the Alps. \n\nWhen\nthis was done, they came to talk of Caesar's will and testament\nand of his funerals and tomb. Then Antonius, thinking \ngood his testament should be read openly, and also that his body\nshould be honourably buried, and not in \n                  , lest\nthe people might thereby take occasion to be worse offended if\nthey did otherwise: Cassius stoutly spake against it. But Brutus\nwent with the motion, and agreed unto it, wherein it seemeth\nhe committed a second fault. For the first fault he did, was\nwhen he would not consent to his fellow-conspirators, that Antonius should be slain; and therefore he was justly accused,\nthat thereby he had saved and strengthened a strong and grievous enemy of their conspiracy. The second fault was, when he\nagreed that Caesar's funerals should be as Antonius would have\nthem, the which indeed marred all. For first of all, when Caesar's\ntestament was openly read among them, whereby it appeared\nthat he bequeathed unto every citizen of Rome 75 drachmas a\nman; and that he left his gardens and arbours unto the people,\nwhich he had on this side of the river Tiber, in the place where\nnow the temple of Fortune is built: the people then loved him, and\nwere marvellous sorry for him. Afterwards, when Caesar's body\nwas brought into the market-place, Antonius making his funeral\noration in praise of the dead, according to the ancient custom of\nRome, and perceiving that his words moved the common people\nto compassion, he framed his eloquence to make their hearts\nyearn the more; and taking Caesar's gown all bloody in his\nhand, he laid it opento the sight of them all shewing what a \n\nnumber of cuts and holes it had upon it. Therewithal the people\nfell presently into such a rage and mutiny, that there was no more\norder kept amongst the common people. For some of them\ncried out, \" Kill the murtherers :\" others plucked up forms, tables,\nand stalls about the market-place, as they had done before at\nthe funerals of Clodius, and having laid them all on a heap\ntogether, they set them on fire, and thereupon did put the body\nof Caesar, and burnt it in the \n                   of the most holy places.\nAnd furthermore, when the fire was \n                   kindled, some\nhere, some there, took burning firebrands, and ran with them to\nthe murtherers' houses that killed him, to set them on fire. Howbeit the conspirators, foreseeing the danger before, had wisely\nprovided for themselves and fled.\n\n \n                  But there was a poet called Cinna, who had been no\npartaker of the conspiracy, but was always one of Caesar's chiefest\nfriends: he dreamed, the night before, that Caesar bad him to\nsupper with him, and that, he refusing to go, Caesar was very\nimportunate with him, and compelled him; so that at length he\nled him by the hand into a great dark place, where, being marvellously afraid, he was driven to follow him in spite of his\n\n                  . This dream put him all night into a fever; and yet notwithstanding, the next morning, when he heard that they carried\nCaesar's body to burial, being ashamed not to accompany his\nfunerals, he went out of his house, and thrust himself into the\n\n                   of the common people that were in a great uproar. And\nbecause some one called him by his name Cinna, the people,\nthinking he had been that Cinna who in an oration he made\nhad spoken very evil of Caesar, they, falling upon him in their\nrage, slew him outright in the market-place. \n\nThis made Brutus\nand his companions more afraid than any other thing, next unto\nthe change of Antonius. Wherefore they got them out of Rome,\nand kept at the first in the city of Antium, hoping to return\nagain to home, when the fury of the people was a little assuaged.\nThe which they hoped would be quickly, considering that they\nhad to deal with a fickle and \n                   multitude, easy to be\n\n                  , and that the Senate stood for them: who notwithstanding made no enquiry for them that had torn poor Cinna the poet\nin pieces, but caused them to be sought for and apprehended\nthat went with firebrands to set fire on the conspirators' houses.\nThe people growing weary now of Antonius' pride and insolency,\nwho ruled all things in a \n                   wtth absolute power, they\ndesired that Brutus might return again; and it was also looked\n\n\n                  \n                   that Brutus would come himself in person to play the plays\nwhich were due to the people, by reason of his office of praetorship. But Brutus, understanding that many of Caesar's soldiers\nwhich served under him in the wars, and that also had lands\nand houses given them in the cities where they \n                  , did lie in\nwait for him to kill him, and that they daily by small companies\ncame by one and by one into Rome, he durst no more return\nthither: but yet the people had the pleasure and pastime in his\nabsence, to see the games and sports he made them, which were\nsumptuously set forth and furnished with all things necessary,\nsparing for no cost. For he had brought a great number of\nstrange beasts, of the which he would not give one of them to\nany friend he had, but that they should all be employed in his\ngames: and went himself as far as Byzantium, to speak to some\nplayers of comedies and musicians that were there. And further\nhe wrote unto his friends for one Canutius, an excellent player,\nthat, whatsoever they did, they should entreat him to play in these\nplays. \"For,\" said he, \"it is no \n                   to compel any Grecian,\nunless he will come of his own good will.\" Moreover he wrote\nalso unto Cicero, and earnestly prayed him in any case to be at\nthese plays.\n\n\n                   \n                  Now the state of Rome standing in these terms, there\nfell out another change and alteration, when the young man\nOctavius Caesar came to Rome. He was the son of Julius Caesar's\nniece, whom he had adopted for his son, and made his heir, by\nhis last will and testament. But when Julius Caesar, his adopted\nfather, was slain, he was in the city of Apollonia (where he\nstudied) tarrying for him, because he was detennined to make\nwar with the Parthians: but when he heard the news of his\ndeath, he returned again to Rome. Where, to begin to curry\nfavour with the common people, he first of all took upon him his\nadopted father's name, and made distribution among them of the\nmoneywhich his father had bequeathed unto them. By this means\nhe troubled Antonius sorely, and by force of money got a great\nnumber of his father's soldiers together, that had served in the\nwars with him. And Cicero himself, for the great malice he\nbare Antonius, did favour his proceedings: but Brutus marvellously reproved him for it, and wrote unto him, that he seemed\nby his doings not to be sorry to have a master, but only to be\nafraid to have one that should hate him: and that all his doings\nin the commonwealth did witness, that he chose to be subject to\na mild and courteous bondage, \n                   by his words and writings\n\n he did commend this young man Octavius Caesar to be a good\nand gentle lord. \"For our predecessors,\" said he, \"would never\nabide to be subject to any masters, how gentle or mild soever\nthey were:\" and, 'for his own part, that he had never resolutely\ndetermined with himself to make war, or peace; but otherwise,\nthat he was certainly minded never to be slave nor subject.\nAnd therefore he wondered much at him, how Cicero could be\nafraid of the danger of civil wars, and would not be afraid of a\nshameful peace: and that, to thrust Antonius out of the usurped\ntyranny, in recompense he went \n                   to establish young Octavius Caesar tyrant.' \n\nThese were the contents of Brutus first\nletters he wrote unto Cicero.\n\n Now the city of Rome being divided in two factions,\nsome taking part with Antonius, others also leaning unto Octavius Caesar, and the soldiers making \n                   of their service\nto him that would give most: Brutus, seeing the state of Rome\nwould be utterly overthrown, he determined to go out of Italy,\nand went on foot through the country of \n                  , unto the city of\nElea, standing by the sea. There Porcia, being ready to depart\nfrom her husband Brutus, and to return to Rome, did what she\ncould to dissemble the grief and sorrow she felt at her heart:\nbut a certain painted \n                  \n                  \n                   her in the end, although\nuntil that time she shewed always a constant and patient mind.\nThe device of the table was taken out of the Greek stories, how\nAndromache accompanied her husband Hector when he went\nout of the city of Troy to go to the wars, and how Hector delivered her his little son, and how her eyes were never off him.\nPorcia seeing this picture, and likening herself to be in the same\ncase, she fell a-weeping: and coming thither oftentimes in a day\nto see it, she wept \n                  . Acilius, one of Brutus' friends, perceiving that, rehearsed the verses Andromache speaketh to this\npurpose in Homer:\n\n\n\nThen Brutus smiling, answered again: \"But yet,\" said he, \"I\ncannot for my part say unto Porcia, as Hector answered Andromache in the same place of the poet:\n\n\n\nFor indeed the weak constitution of her body doth not suffer\nher to perform in shew the valiant acts that we are able to do:\n\n\nbut for courage and constant mind, she shewed herself as stout\nin the defence of her country, as any of us.\" Bibulus, the son of\nPorcia, reporteth this story thus. \n\n\n                  Now Brutus embarking at\nElea in \n                  , he sailed directly towards Athens. When he\narrived there, the people of Athens received him with common\njoys of rejoicing and honourable decrees made for him.  He\n\n                   with a friend of his, with whom he went daily to hear the\nlectures of Theomnestus the Academic philosopher, and of\nCratippus the Peripatetic, and so should talk with them in philosophy, that he seemed he left all other matters, and gave himself\nonly to study: howbeit secretly, notwithstanding, he made preparation for war.  For he sent Herostratus into Macedon, to\nwin the captains and soldiers that were upon those \n                  ,\nand he did also entertain all the young gentlemen of the\nRomans, whom he found in Athens studying philosophy:\namongst them he found Cicero's son, whom he highly praised\nand commended, saying: \"That, whether he waked or slept,\nhe found him of a noble mind and disposition, he did in nature\nso much hate tyrants.\" Shortly after, he began to enter openly\ninto arms: and being \n                   that there came out of Asia a\ncertain fleet of Roman ships that had got good store of money\nin them, and that the captain of those ships (who was an honest\nman and his familiar friend) came towards Athens: he went\nto meet him as far as the \n                   of Carystos, and having spoken\nwith him there, he handled him so that he was contented to\nleave his ships in his hands: whereupon he made him a notable\nbanquet at his house, because it was on his birthday. When\nthe feast-day came, and that they began to drink lustily one to\nanother, the guests drank to the victory of Brutus and the\nliberty of the Romans. Brutus therefore, to encourage them\nfarther, called for a bigger cup; and, holding it in his hand, before\nhe drank spake this aloud:\n\n\n\nAnd for proof hereof it is reported, that, the same day he fought\nhis last battle by the city of \n                  , as he came out of his\ntent, he gave them for the word and signal of battle, 'Phoebus':\nso that it was thought ever since, that this his sudden crying out\nat the feast was a prognostication of his misfortune that should\nhappen. \n\nAfter this, Antistius gave him, of the money he carried\ninto Italy, fifty myriads. Furthermore, all Pompey's soldiers,\nthat straggled up and down Thessaly, came with very good will\n\n unto him. He took from Cinna also five hundred horsemen,\nwhich he carried into Asia unto Dolabella. After that, he went\nby sea unto the city of \n                  , and there took a great deal\nof armour and munition which was going to Antonius: and the\nwhich had been made and forged there by Julius Caesar's commandment, for the wars against the Parthians. Furthermore\nHortensius, governor of Macedon, did resign the government\nthereof unto him. Besides, all the princes, kings, and noblemen thereabouts, came and joined with him, when it was told\nhim, that Caius (Antonius' brother) coming out of Italy, had\npassed the sea, and came with great speed towards the city of\nDyrrachium, and Apollonia, to get the soldiers into his hands\nwhich Gabinius had there. Brutus therefore, to \n                   him,\nwent presently with a few of his men in the midst of winter\nwhen it did snow hard, and took his way through hard and foul\ncountries, and made such speed indeed, that he was there long\nbefore Antonius' sumpters that carried the victuals.\n\n  \n                  So that when he came near to Dyrrachium, a disease\ntook him, which the physicians call , to say, a \n. and \n                   appetite to eat; by reason of the cold and\npains he had taken. This sickness chanceth often both to men\nand beasts, that travel when it hath \n                  : either because\nthe natural heat, being retired into the inward parts of the body,\nby the coldness of the air hardening the skin, doth straight\ndigest and consume the meat: or else because a sharp subtle\nwind, coming by reason of the snow when it is molten, doth\npierce into the body, and driveth out the natural heat which\nwas cast outward. For it seemeth that the heat, being quenched\nwith the cold which it meeteth withal coming out of the skin of\nthe body, causeth the sweats that follow the disease. But hereof\nwe have spoken at large in other places. \n\nBrutus being very\nfaint, and having nothing in his camp to eat, his soldiers were\ncompelled to go to their enemies; and coming to the gates of\nthe city, they prayed the warders to help them to bread. When\nthey heard in what case Brutus was, they brought him both\nmeat and drink: in requital whereof, afterwards, when he \n                  \nthe city, he did not only \n                   and use the citizens thereof\ncourteously, but all the inhabitants of the city also for their\nsakes. Now when Caius Antonius was arrived in the city of\nApollonia, he sent unto the soldiers thereabouts to come unto\nhim. But when he understood that they went all to Brutus, and\nfurthermore. that the citizens of Apollonia did favour him much,\n\n\nhe then forsook that city and went unto the city of Buthrotus;\nbut yet he lost three of his \n                   by the way, that were slain\nevery man of them. Then he sought by force to win certain\nplaces of strength about Byllis, and to drive Brutus' men from\nthence, that had taken it before: and therefore, to obtain his\npurpose, he sought a battle with Cicero, the son of Marcus\nTullius Cicero, by whom he was overcome. For Brutus made\nthe younger Cicero a captain, and did many notable exploits by\nhis service. Shortly after, having stolen upon Caius Antonius\nin certain \n                   far from the place from whence he fled, he\nwould not set on him with fury but only rode round about him,\ncommanding his soldiers to spare him and his men, as reckoning\nthem all his own without stroke striking. And so indeed it\nhappened: for they yielded themselves and their captain Antomus unto Brutus; so that Brutus had now a great army about\nhim. Now Brutus kept this Caius Antonius long time in his\noffice, and never took from him the marks and signs of his\nConsulship, although many of his friends, and Cicero among\nothers, wrote unto him to put him to death. But when he saw\nAntonius secretly \n                   with his captains to make some\nalteration, then he sent him into a ship, and made him to be\nkept there. When the soldiers whom Caius Antonius had corrupted were gotten into the city of Apollonia, and sent from\nthence unto Brutus to come unto them, he made them answer,\n\"That it was not the manner of Roman captains to come to\nthe soldiers, but the soldiers to come to the captain, and to\ncrave pardon for their offences committed.\" Thereupon they\ncame to him, and he pardoned them.\n\n\n                   So Brutus preparing to go into Asia, news came unto\nhim of the great change at Rome: for Octavius Caesar was in\narms, by commandment and authority from the Senate, against\nMarcus Antonius. But after that he had driven Antonius out\nof Italy, the Senate began then to be afraid of him, because he\nsued to be Consul, which was contrary to the law; and kept a\ngreat army about him when the empire of Rome had no need\nof them. On the other side Octavius Caesar, perceiving the\nSenate stayed not there, but turned unto Brutus that was out of\nItaly, and that they appointed him the government of certain\nprovinces: then he began to be afraid for his part, and sent\nunto Antonius to offer him his friendship. Then coming on\nunto his army near to Rome, he made himself to be chosen\nConsul, whether the Senate would or not, when he was yet but\n\na stripling or \n                   of twenty years old, as himself reporteth\nin his own Commentaries. So when he was Consul, he pre\n                   appointed judges, to accuse Brutus and his companions\nfor killing of the noblest person in Rome and chiefest magistrate\nwithout law or judgment: and made L. Cornificius accuse\nBrutus, and M. Agrippa, Cassius. So the parties accused were\ncondemned, because the Judges were compelled to give such\nsentence. The \n                   went, that when the herald (according to\nthe custom after sentence given) went up to the chair or pulpit\nfor orations, and proclaimed 'Brutus' with a loud voice, summorning him to appear in person before the judges, the people\nthat stood by sighed openly, and the noblemen that were present\nhung down their heads, and durst not speak a word. Among\nthem the tears fell from Publius Silicius' eyes: who, shortly\nafter, was one of the proscripts or outlaws appointed to be slain.\nAfter that, these three, Octavius Caesar, Antonius, and Lepidus,\nmade an agreement between themselves, and by those articles\ndivided the provinces belonging to the empire of Rome among\nthemselves, and did set up \n                   of proscription and outlawry,\ncondemning two hundred of the noblest men of Rome to suffer\ndeath, and among that number Cicero was one. \n\n                  News being\nbrought thereof into Macedon, Brutus, being then enforced to do\nit, wrote unto Hortensius that he should put Caius Antonius to\ndeath, to be revenged of the death of Cicero and of the other\nBrutus, of the which the one was his friend, and the other a\nkinsman. For this cause therefore Antonius afterwards, taking\nHortensius at the battle of Philippes, he made him to be slain\nupon his brother's tomb. But when Brutus said that, he was\nmore ashamed of the cause for the which Cicero was slain than\nhe was otherwise sorry for his death; and that he could not but\ngreatly reprove his friends he had at Rome, who were slaves more\nthrough their own fault than through their valiantness or manhood which usurped the tyranny: considering that they were so\ncowardly and faint-hearted, as to suffer the sight of those things\nbefore their eyes, the report whereof should only have grieved\nthem to the heart.\n\n Now when Brutus had passed over his army (that was\nvery great) into Asia, he gave order for the gathering of a great\nnumber of ships together, as well in the coast of Bithynia, as also\nin the city of Cyzicum, because he would have an army by sea;\nand himself in the meantime went unto the cities, taking order\n\n                   all things, and giving audience to princes and noblemen of\n\nthe country that had to do with him. Afterwards he sent\nunto Cassius in Syria, to turn him from his journey into Egypt,\ntelling him that it was not for the conquest of any kingdom for\nthemselves that they wandered up and down in that sort, but\ncontrarily, that it was to restore their country again to her\nliberty: and that the multitude of soldiers they gathered together was to subdue the tyrants that would keep them in\nslavery and subjection. Wherefore, regarding their chief purpose and intent, they should not be far from Italy, as near as\nthey could possible, but should rather make all the haste they\ncould, to keep their countrymen. Cassius believed him, and\nreturned. Brutus went to meet him, and they both met at the\ncity of Smyrna, which was the first time that they saw together\nsince they took leave each of other at the haven of Piraea in\nAthens, the one going into Syria, and the other into Macedon.\nSo they were marvellous joyful, and no less courageous, when\nthey saw the great armies together which they had both \nlevied:\nconsidering that they departed out of Italy like naked \nand poor\nbanished men, without armour and money, nor having any ship\nready nor soldier about them, nor any one town at their \ncommandment; yet notwithstanding, in a short time after, they were\nnow met together, having ships, money, and soldiers enough,\nboth footmen and horsemen, to fight for the empire of Rome.\n\n\n                    Now Cassius would have done Brutus much honour, as\nBrutus did unto him, but Brutus most commonly \n                   him,\nand went first unto him, both because he was the elder \nman as also for that he was sickly of body. And men reputed him commonly to be very skilful in wars, but otherwise marvellous\ncholeric and cruel, who sought to rule men by fear rather than\nwith lenity: and on the other side, he was too familiar with\nhis friends, and would jest too broadly with them. But Brutus,\nin contrary manner, for his virtue and valiantness, was well beloved of the people and his own, esteemed of noblemen, and\nhated of no man, not so much as of his enemies; because he \nwas a marvellous lowly and gentle person, noble-minded, and\nwould never be in any rage, nor carried away with pleasure\nand covetousness, but had ever an upright mind with him,\nand would never yield to any wrong or injustice; the which was \nthe chiefest cause of his fame, of his rising, and of the goodwill\nthat every man bare him: for they were all persuaded that his\nintent was good. For they did not certainly believe that, if\nPompey himself had overcome Caesar, he would have resigned\n\nhis authority to the law, but rather they were of opinion that he\nwould still keep the sovereignty and absolute government in his\nhands, taking only, to please the people, the title of Consul, or\nDictator, or of some other more civil office. And as for Cassius,\na hot, choleric, and cruel man, that would oftentimes be carried\naway from justice for gain, it was certainly thought that he made\nwar and put himself into sundry dangers, more to have absolute\npower and authority than to defend the liberty of his country.\nFor they that will also consider others that were elder men\nthan they, as Cinna, Marinus, and Carbo, it is out of doubt that\nthe end and hope of their victory was to be the lords of their\ncountry, and in manner they did all confess that they fought for\nthe tyranny, and to be lords of the empire of Rome. And in\ncontrary manner, his enemies themselves did never reprove\nBrutus for any such change or desire. For it was said that\nAntonius spake it openly divers times, that he thought, that\nof all them that had slain Caesar, there was none but Brutus\nonly that was moved to do it, as thinking the act commendable of itself: but that all the other conspirators did conspire\nhis death for some private malice or envy, that they otherwise did bear unto him. Hereby it appeareth, that Brutus did\nnot trust so much to the power of his army as he did to his\nown virtue, as it is to be seen by his writings. For approaching near to the \n                   danger, he wrote unto Pomponius\nAtticus that his affairs had the best hap that could be. \"For,\"\nsaid he, \"either I will set my country at liberty by battle, or by\nhonourable death rid me of this bondage.\" And furthermore,\nthat they being certain and assured of all things else, this one\nthing only was doubtful to them: whether they should live or\ndie with liberty. He wrote also that Antonius had his due payment for his folly: \" for \n                  , he might have been a partner\nequally of the glory of Brutus, Cassius, and Cato, and have made\none with them, he liked better to choose to be joined with Octavius Caesar alone: with whom, though now he be not overcome\nby us, yet shall he shortly after also have war with him.\" . And\ntruly he proved a true prophet, for so came it indeed to pass.\n\nNow whilst Brutus and Cassius were together in the city of\nSmyrna, Brutus prayed Cassius to let him have some part of his\nmoney whereof he had great store; because all that he could rap\nand \n                   of his side, he had bestowed it in making so great a\nnumber of ships, that by means of them they should keep all the\nsea at their commandment. Cassius' friends hindered this\n\n\nrequest and earnestly dissuaded him from it, persuading him,\nthat it was no reason that Brutus should have the money which\nCassius had gotten together by sparing and levied with great\nevil will of the people their subjects, for him to bestow liberally\nupon his soldiers, and by this means to win their good wills, by\nCassius' \n                  . This notwithstanding, Cassius gave him the\nthird part of this total sum. So Cassius and Brutus then departing from each other, Cassius took the city of Rhodes, where\nhe too dishonestly and cruelly used himself: although, when he\ncame into the city, he answered some of the inhabitants who\ncalled him lord and king, that he was neither lord nor king,\nbut \n                   only that had slain him that would have been lord\nand king.\n\n Brutus, departing from thence, sent unto the Lycians\nto \n                   money and men of war. But there was a certain\norator called Naucrates, that made the cities to rebel against\nhim, insomuch that the countrymen of that country kept the\n\n                   and little mountains, thinking by that means to stop\nBrutus' passage. Wherefore Brutus sent his horsemen against\nthem, who stole upon them as they were at dinner, and \nslew\nsix hundred of them: and taking all the small towns and \nvillages, he did get all the prisoners he took go without payment\nof ransom, hoping by this his great courtesy to win them, to\ndraw all the rest of the country unto him. But they were so\nfierce and obstinate, that they would \n                   for every small\nhurt they received as he passed by their country, and did despise his courtesy and good nature: until that at length he\nwent to besiege the city of the Xanthians, within the which\nwere shut up the cruellest and most warlike men of Lycia.\nThere was a river that ran by the walls of the city, in the\nwhich many men saved themselves, swimming between two\nwaters, and fled: howbeit they laid nets overthwart the river,\nand tied little bells on the top of them, to sound when any\nman was taken in the nets. The Xanthians made a sally out\nby night, and came to fire certain engines of the battery that\nbeat down their walls: but they were \n                   driven in again\nby the Romans, so soon as they were discovered. The wind\nby chance was marvellous big, and increased the flame so\nsore, that it violently carried it into the \n                   of the\nwall of the city, that the \n                   houses unto them were straight\nset on fire thereby. Wherefore Brutus being afraid that all\nthe city would take on \n                  , he \n                   commanded his men\n\nto quench the fire, and to save the town if it might be. \n\nBut\nthe Lycians at that instant fell into such a frenzy and strange\nand horrible despair, that no man can well express it: and a\nman cannot more rightly compare or liken it than to a frantic and most desperate desire to die. For all of them together,\nwith their wives and children, masters and servants, and of all\nsorts of age whatsoever, fought upon the \n                   of their\nwalls and did cast down stones and fire-works on the Romans,\nwhich were very busy in quenching the flame of the fire, to\nsave the city. And in contrary manner also, they brought\nfaggots, dry wood, and reeds, to bring the fire further into the\ncity as much as might be, increasing it by such things as they\nbrought. Now when the fire had gotten into all parts of the\ncity, and that the flame burnt bright in every place, Brutus,\nbeing sorry to see it, got upon his horse, and rode round about\nthe walls of the city, to see if it were possible for to save it,\nand held up his hands to the inhabitants, praying them to\npardon their city, and to save themselves. Howbeit they would\nnot be persuaded, but did all that they could possible to cast\nthemselves away, not only men and women, but also little children. For some of them, weeping and crying out, did cast\nthemselves into the fire: others, headlong throwing themselves\ndown from the walls, brake their necks: others also made their\nbacks bare to the naked swords of their fathers, and undid\ntheir clothes, praying them to kill them with their own hands.\nAfter the city was burnt, they found a woman hanged up by\nthe neck, holding one of her children in her hand dead by\nher, hanged up also, and in the other hand a burning torch\nsetting fire \n                   her house. Some would have had Brutus to\nhave seen her, but he would not see so horrible and tragical\na sight: but when he heard it, he fell a-weeping, and caused an\nherald to make proclamation by sound of trumpet, that he\nwould give a certain sum of money to every soldier that could\nsave a Xanthian. So there were not (as it is reported) above\nfifty of them saved, and yet they were saved against their wills.\nThus the Xanthians having ended the revolution of their fatal\ndestiny after a long continuance of time, they did through their\ndesperation renew the memory of the lamentable calamities of\ntheir ancestors, who in like manner, in the wars of the Persians,\ndid burn their city, and destroyed themselves. \n\nTherefore\nBrutus, likewise besieging the city of the Patareians, perceiving\nthat they stoutly resisted him, he was also afraid of that, and\n\n\ncould not well tell whether he should give assault to it or not,\nlest they would fall into the despair and desperation of the\nXanthians. Howbeit, having taken certain of their women\nprisoners, he sent them back again without payment of ransom.\nNow they that were the wives and daughters of the noblest men\nof the city, reporting unto their parents that they had found\nBrutus a merciful, just, and courteous man, they persuaded them\nto yield themselves and their city unto him, the which they did.\nSo after they had thus yielded themselves, divers other cities\nalso followed them, and did the like: and found Brutus more\nmerciful and courteous than they thought they should have\ndone, but specially far above Cassius. For Cassius, about the\nself-same time, after he had compelled the Rhodians every man\nto deliver all the ready money they had in gold and silver in their\nhouses, the which, being brought together, amounted to the sum\nof eight thousand talents: yet he condemned the city besides, to\npay the sum of five hundred talents more. \n                  \n                   Brutus in\ncontrary manner, after be had levied of all the country of Lycia\nbut an hundred and fifty talents only, he departed thence into\nthe country of Ionia, and did them no more hurt.\n\n\n                   Now Brutus, in all this journey, did many notable acts\nand worthy of memory, both for rewarding, as also in punishing\nthose that had deserved it: wherefore, among the rest, I will tell\nyou of one thing, of the which he himself and all the noblemen\nof the Romans were marvellous glad. When Pompey the Great\n(having lost the battle against Julius Caesar, in the fields of\nPharsalia) came and fell upon the coast of Egypt, hard by the\ncity of Pelusium, those that were protectors to the young king\nPtolemy, being then but a child, sat in counsel with his servants\nand friends, what they should determine in that case. They\nwere not all of one mind in this consultation: for some thought\nit good to receive Pompey: others also, that they should drive\nhim out of Egypt. But there was a certain rhetorician called\nTheodotus, that was born in the isle of Chio, who was the king's\nschoolmaster to teach him rhetoric. He, being called to the\ncouncil for lack of sufficient men, said, \"That both the one and\nthe other side went \n                  , as well those that were of opinion to\nreceive Pompey as the other that would have had him driven\naway: and that the best way was (considering the present time)\nthat they should lay hold on him, and kill him;\" adding withal\nthis \n                  , \"that a dead man biteth not.\" The whole council stuck to this opinion. So, for a notable example of incredible\n\nmisfortune, and unlooked-for unto Pompey, Pompey the\nGreat was slain by the motion and counsel of this wicked rhetorician Theodotus, as Theodotus afterwards did himself boast\nof it. But when Julius Caesar came afterwards into Egypt, the\nwicked men that consented to this counsel had their payment\naccording to their deserts: for they died every man of them a\nwicked death, saving this Theodotus, whom fortune respited a\nlittle while longer; and yet in that thne he lived a poor and\nmiserable life, never tarrying long in any one place. So Brutus\ngoing up and down Asia, Theodotus could hide himself no longer,\nbut was brought unto Brutus, where he suffered pains of death:\nso that he \n                   more fame by his death, than ever he did in his\nlife.\n\n\n                  \n                  About that time Brutus sent to pray Cassius to come\nto the city of Sardis, and so he did. Brutus, understanding of\nhis coming, went to meet him with all his friends. There both\ntheir armies being armed, they called them both . \nNow\nas it commonly happened in great affairs between two persons,\nboth of them having many friends and so many captains under\nthem, there ran tales and complaints betwixt them. Therefore,\nbefore they fell in hand with any other matter, they went into a\nlittle chamber together, and bade every man \n                  , and did\nshut the doors to them. Then they began to pour out their\ncomplaints one to the other, and grew hot and loud, earnestly\naccusing one another, and at length fell both a-weeping. Their\nfriends that were \n                   the chamber, hearing them loud within, and angry between themselves, they were both amazed and\nafraid also, lest it would grow to further matter: but yet they\nwere commanded that no man should come to them. Notwithstanding, one Marcus Phaonius, that had been a friend and a\nfollower of Cato while he lived, and took upon him to counterfeit\na philosopher, not with wisdom and discretion, but with a certain \n                   and frantic motion: he would needs come into the\nchamber, though the men \n                   to keep him out. But it was\n\n                   to \n                   Phaonius, when a mad mood or \n                   took him in\nthe head: for he was a hot hasty man, and sudden in all his\ndoings, and cared for never a senator of them all. Now, though\nhe used this bold manner of speech after the profession of the\nCynic philosophers (as who would say, ), yet his \nboldness did no hurt many times, because they did but laugh at him to\nsee him so mad. This Phaonius at that time, in despite of the\ndoor-keepers, came into the chamber, and with a certain scoffing\n\nand mocking gesture, which he counterfeited of \n                  , he rehearsed the verses which old Nestor said in Homer:\n\n\n\nCassius fell a-laughing at him: but Brutus thrust him out of the\nchamber, and called him dog, and counterfeit Cynic. Howbeit\nhis coming in brake their strife at that thee, and so they left\neach other. The self-same night Cassius prepared his supper in\nhis chamber, and Brutus brought his friends with him. So\nwhen they were set at supper, Phaonius came to sit down after\nhe had washed. Brutus told him aloud, 'no man sent for him,'\nand bad them set him at the upper end: meaning indeed, at the\nlower end of the \n                  . Phaonius made no ceremony, but thrust\nin amongst the \n                   of them, and made all the company\nlaugh at him. So they were merry all supper-time, and full of\ntheir philosophy. \n\nThe next day after, Brutus, upon complaint\nof the Sardians, did condemn and note Lucius Pella for a defamed person, that had been a Praetor of the Romans, and whom\nBrutus had given charge unto: for that he was accused and convicted of robbery end pilfery in his office. This judgment much\n\n                   Cassius, because he himself had secretly (not many\ndays before) warned two of his friends, attainted and convicted\nof the like offences, and openly had cleared them: but yet he\ndid not therefore \n                   to employ them in any manner of service\nas he did before. And therefore he greatly reproved Brutus, for\nthat he would shew himself so \n                   and severe, in such a\ntime as was meeter to bear a little than to take things at the\nworst. Brutus in contrary manner answered, that he should remember the Ides of March, at which time they slew Julius Caesar,\nwho neither \n                   nor \n                   the country but only was a \nfavourer and suborner of all them that did rob and spoil, by his countenance and authority. And if there were any occasion whereby\nthey might honestly set aside justice and equity, they should\nhave had more reason to have suffered Caesar's friends to have\nrobbed and done what wrong and injury they had \n                   than to\nbear with their own men. \"For then,\" said he, \"they could but\nhave said \n                   had been cowards, but now they may accuse us\nof injustice, beside the pains we take, and the danger we put\nourselves into.\" And thus may we see what Brutus' intent and\npurpose was\n\n\n                   \n                  But as they both prepared to pass over again out of\nAsia into Europe, there went a rumour that there appeared a\n\nwonderful sign unto him. Brutus was a careful man, and slept\nvery little, both for that his diet was moderate, as also because\nhe was continually occupied. He never slept in the day-time,\nand in the night no longer than the time he was driven to be\nalone, and when everybody else took their rest. But now whilst\nhe was in war, and his head ever busily occupied to think of his\naffairs and what would happen, after he had slumbered a little\nafter supper, he spent all the rest of the night in dispatching of\nhis weightiest causes; and after he had taken order for them, if\nhe had any leisure left him, he would read some book till the\nthird watch of the night, at what time the captains, petty captains, and colonels, did use to come to him. So, being ready to\ngo into Europe, one night very late (when all the camp took\nquiet rest) as he was in his tent with a little light, thinking of\nweighty matters, he thought he heard one come in to him, and\ncasting his eye towards the door of his tent, that he saw a wonderful strange and monstrous shape of a body coming towards\nhim, and said never a word. So Brutus boldly asked what he\nwas, a god or a man, and what cause brought him thither ? The\nspirit answered him, \"I am thy evil spirit, Brutus: and thou\nshalt see me by the city of \n                  .'' Brutus being no otherwise afraid, replied again unto it: \"Well, then I shall see thee\nagain.\" \n\nThe spirit \n                  vanished away: and Brutus called\nhis men unto him, who told him that they heard no noise, nor\nsaw anything at all. Thereupon Brutus returned again to think\non his matters as he did before: and when the day brake, he\nwent unto Cassius, to tell him what vision had appeared unto\nhim in the night. Cassius being in opinion an Epicurean, and\nreasoning thereon with Brutus, spake to him touching the vision\nthus.\" In our sect, Brutus, we have an opinion, that we do not\nalways feel or see that which we suppose we do both see and\nfeel, but that our senses being credulous and therefore easily\nabused (when they are idle and unoccupied in their own objects)\nare induced to imagine they see and conjecture that which in\ntruth they do not. For our mind is quick and cunning to work\n(without either cause or matter) anything in the imagination\nwhatsoever. And therefore the imagination is resembled to clay,\nand the mind to the potter: who, without any other cause than\nhis fancy and pleasure, changeth it into what fashion and form\nhe will. And this doth the diversity of our dreams shew unto\nus. For our imagination doth upon a small fancy grow from\n\n                   to conceipt, altering both in passions and forms of\n\n\nthings imagined. For the mind of man is ever occupied, and\nthat continual moving is nothing but an imagination. But yet\nthere is a further cause of this in you. For you being by nature\ngiven to melancholic discoursing, and of late continually occupied, your wits and senses, having been over-laboured, do easilier\nyield to such imaginations. For, to say that there are spirits or\nangels; and if there were, that they had the shape of men, or\nsuch voices or any power at all to come unto us, it is a mockery.\nAnd for mine own part, I would there were such, because that\nwe should not only have soldiers, horses, and ships, but also the\naid of the gods, to guide and further our honest and honourable\nattempts.\" With these words Cassius did somewhat comfort\nand quiet Brutus. When they raised their camp, there came\ntwo eagles that, flying with a marvellous force, lighted upon two\nof the foremost ensigns, and always followed the soldiers, which\ngave them meat and fed them, until they came near to the city\nof Philippes: and there, one day only before the battle, they both\nflew away.\n\n\n                   Now Brutus had conquered the most part of all the\npeople and nations of that country; but if there were any other\ncity or captain to overcome, then they made all clear before\nthem, and so drew towards the coasts of Thassos. There Norbanus, Iying in camp in a certain place called the \n                  , by\nanother place called Symbolon (which is a port in the sea),\nCassius and Brutus compassed him in in such sort, that he was\ndriven to forsake the place, which was of great strength for him,\nand he was also in danger beside to have lost all his army. For\nOctavius Caesar could not follow him because of his sickness,\nand therefore stayed behind: whereupon they had taken his\narmy, had not Antonius' aid been, which made such wonderful\nspeed, that Brutus could \n                   believe it. So Caesar came not\nthither \n                   ten days after: and Antonius camped against Cassius, and Brutus on the other side, against Caesar. The Romans\ncalled the valley between both camps, the Philippian fields: and\nthere were never seen two so great armies of the Romans, one\nbefore the other, ready to fight. In truth, Brutus' army was inferior to Octavius Caesar's in number of men; but for bravery\nand rich \n                  , Brutus' army far excelled Caesar's. For the\nmost part of their armours were silver and gilt, which Brutus\nhad bountifully given them: although, in all other things, he\ntaught his captains to live in order without excess. But for the\nbravery of armour and weapon, which soldiers should carry in\n\n their hands, or otherwise wear upon their backs, he thought that\nit was an encouragement unto them that by nature are greedy\nof honour, and that it maketh them also fight like devils that\nlove to get, and to be afraid to lose: because they fight to keep\ntheir armour and weapon, as also their goods and lands. \n\nNow\nwhen they came to muster their armies, Octavius Caesar took\nthe muster of his army within the trenches of his camp, and\ngave his men only a little corn, and five silver drachmas to\nevery man to sacrifice to the gods, and to pray for victory. But\nBrutus, scorning this misery and niggardliness, first of all mustered his army, and did purify it in the fields, according to the\nmanner of the Romans: and then he gave unto every band a\nnumber of wethers to sacrifice, and fifty silver drachmas to\nevery soldier. So that Brutus' and Cassius' soldiers were better\npleased, and more courageously bent to fight at the day of\nbattle, than their enemies' soldiers were. Notwithstanding,\nbeing busily occupied about the ceremonies of this purification,\nit is reported that there chanced certain unlucky signs unto Cassius. For one of his sergeants that carried the rods before him,\nbrought him the garland of flowers turned backward, the which\nhe should have worn on his head in the time of sacrificing.\nMoreover it is reported also, that another time before, in certain\nsports and triumph where they carried an image of Cassius'\nvictory, of \n                   gold, it fell by chance, the man stumbling that\ncarried it. And yet further, there was seen a marvellous number\nof \n                   of prey, that feed upon dead carcases: and bee-hives\nalso were found, where bees were gathered together in a certain\nplace within the trenches of the camp: the which place the\nsoothsayers thought good to shut out of the precinct of the\ncamp, for to take away the superstitious fear and mistrust men\nwould have of it. The which began somewhat to alter Cassius'\nmind from Epicurus' opinions, and had put the soldiers also in\na marvellous fear. Thereupon Cassius was of opinion not to\ntry this war at one battle, but rather to delay time, and to draw\nit out in length, considering that they were the stronger in\nmoney, and the weaker in men and armour. But Brutus, in\ncontrary manner, did alway before, and at that time also, desire\nnothing more than to put all to the hazard of battle, as soon as\nmight be possible: to the end he might either quickly restore\nhis country to her former liberty, or rid him forthwith of this\nmiserable world, being \n                   troubled in following and maintaining of such great armies together. But perceiving that, in the\n\ndaily skirmishes and bickerings they made, his men were always\nthe stronger and ever had the better, that yet quickened his spirits again, and did put him in better heart. And furthermore,\nbecause that some of their own men had already yielded themselves to their enemies, and that it was suspected moreover\ndivers others would do the like, that made many of Cassius'\nfriends which were of his mind before (when it came to be debated in council, whether the battle should be fought or not)\nthat they were then of Brutus' mind. But yet was there one of\nBrutus' friends called Atellius, that was against it, and was of\nopinion that they should tarry to the next winter. Brutus asked\nhim what he should get by tarrying a year longer? \" If I get\nnothing else,\" quoth Atellius again, \" yet have I lived so much\nlonger.\" Cassius was very angry with this answer: and Atellius\nwas \n                   and esteemed the worse for it of all men. Thereupon it was presently determined they should fight battle the\nnext day. \n\nSo Brutus, all supper-time, looked with a cheerful\ncountenance, like a man that had good hope, and talked very\nwisely of philosophy, and after supper went to bed. But touching Cassius, Messala reporteth that he supped by himself in his\ntent with a few of his friends, and that all supper-time he looked\nvery sadly, and was full of thoughts, although it was against his\nnature: and that after supper he took him by the hand, and\nholding him fast (in token of kindness, as his manner was) told\nhim in Greek: \" Messala, I protest unto thee, and make thee\nmy witness, that I am compelled against my mind and will (as\nPompey the Great was) to \n                   the liberty of our country to\nthe hazard of a battle. And yet we must be lively, and of good\ncourage, considering our good fortune, whom we should wrong\ntoo much to mistrust her, although we follow evil counsel.\"\nMessala writeth, that Cassius having spoken these last words\nunto him, he bade him farewell, and willed him to come to supper to him the next night following, because it was his birthday. The next morning, by break of day, the signal of battle\nwas set out in Brutus' and Cassius' camp, which was an arming\nscarlet coat: and both the chieftains spake together in the\nmidst of their armies. There Cassius began to speak first, and\nsaid: \"The gods grant us, O Brutus, that this day we may win\nthe field, and ever after to live all the rest of our life quietly\none with another. But \n                   the gods have so ordained it, that\nthe greatest and chiefest things amongst men are most uncertain, and that if the battle fall out otherwise to-day than we\n\nwish or look for, we shall hardly meet again, what art thou then\ndetermined to do, to fly, or die?\" Brutus answered him, being\nyet but a young man, and not over greatly experienced in the\nworld: \" I trust (I know not how, a certain rule of philosophy,\nby the which I did greatly blame and reprove Cato for killing\nhimself, as being no lawful nor godly act, touching the gods:\nnor concerning men, valiant; not to give place and yield to\ndivine providence, and not constantly and patiently to take\nwhatsoever it pleaseth him to send us, but to draw back and\nfly: but being now in the midst of the danger, I am of a contrary mind. For if it be not the will of God that this battle\nfall out fortunate for us, I will look no more for hope, neither\nseek to make any new supply for war again, but will rid me of\nthis miserable world, and content me with my fortune. For I\ngave up my life for my country in the Ides of March, for the\nwhich I shall live in another more glorious world.\" Cassius\nfell a-laughing to hear what he said, and embracing him,\n\"Come on then,\" said he, \"let us go and charge our enemies\nwith this mind. For either we shall conquer, or we shall not\nneed to fear the conquerors.\" After this talk, they fell to consultation among their friends for the ordering of the battle.\nThen Brutus prayed Cassius he might have the leading of the\nright wing, the which men thought was far meeter for Cassius,\nboth because he was the elder man, and also for that he had\nthe better experience. But yet Cassius gave it him, and willed\nthat Messala (who had charge of one of the warlikest legions\nthey had) should be also in that wing with Brutus. So Brutus\npresently sent out his horsemen, who were excellently well appointed, and his footmen also were as willing and ready to give\ncharge.\n\n\n                   Now Antonius' men did cast a trench from the \n                  \nby the which they lay, to cut off Cassius' way to come to the sea:\nand Caesar, at the least his army stirred not. As for Octavius\nCaesar himself, he was not in his camp because he was sick.\nAnd for his people, they little thought the enemies would have\ngiven them battle, but only have made some light skirmishes to\nhinder them that wrought in the trench, and with their darts\nand slings to have kept them from finishing of their work: but\nthey, taking no heed to them that came full upon them to give\nthem battle, marvelled much at the great noise they heard, that\ncame from the place where they were casting their trench. In\nthe meantime Brutus, that led the right wing, sent little \n                   to\n\nthe colonels and captains of private bands, in the which he\nwrote the word of the battle; and he himself, riding a-horseback\nby all the \n                  , did speak to them, and encouraged them to\nstick to it like men. So by this means very few of them understood what was the word of the battle, and besides, the most\npart of them never tarried to have it told them, but ran with\ngreat fury to assail the enemies; whereby, through this disorder,\nthe legions were marvellously scattered and dispersed one from\nthe other. For first of all Messala's legion, and then the next\nunto them, went beyond the left wing of the enemies, and did\nnothing, but glancing by them overthrew some as they went;\nand so going on further, fell right upon Caesar's camp, out of the\nwhich (as himself writeth in his commentaries) he had been conveyed away a little before, through the counsel and advice of one\nof his friends called Marcus Artorius: who, dreaming in the\nnight, had a vision appeared unto him, that commanded \nOctavius\nCaesar should be carried out of his camp. Insomuch as it was\nthought he was slain, because his litter (which had nothing in it)\nwas thrust through and through with pikes and darts. There\nwas great slaughter in this camp. For amongst others, there\nwere slain two thousand Lacedaemonians, who were arrived but\neven a little before, coming to aid Caesar. \n\nThe other also that\nhad not glanced by, but had given a charge full upon Caesar's\n\n                  , they easily made them fly, because they were greatly\ntroubled for the loss of their camp; and of them there were slain\nby hand three legions. Then, being very earnest to follow the\nchase of them that fled, they ran in amongst them hand over\n\n                   into their camp, and Brutus among them. But that which\nthe conquerors thought not of, \n                   shewed it unto them\nthat they were overcome; and that was, the left wing of their\nenemies left naked and unguarded \n                   them of the right wing,\nwho were strayed too far off, in following of them that were\noverthrown. So they gave a hot charge upon them. But, notwithstanding all the force they made, they could not break into\nthe midst of their battle, where they found them that received\nthem and valiantly made head against them. How-beit they\nbrake and overthrew the left wing where Cassius was, by reason\nof the great disorder among them, and also because they had no\nintelligence how the right wing had sped. So they chased them,\nbeating them into their camp, the which they spoiled, none of\nboth the chieftains being present there. For Antonius, as it is\nreported, to fly the fury cf the first charge, was gotten into the\n\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  : and no man could tell what became of Octavius\nCaesar, after he was carried out of his camp. Insomuch that\nthere were certain soldiers that shewed their swords \n                  ,\nand said that they had slain him, and did describe his face, and\nshewed what age he was of. Furthermore, the \n                   end the\n\n                   of Brutus' \n                   had already put all their enemies to\nflight that withstood them, with great slaughter: so that Brutus\nhad conquered all on his side, and Cassius had lost all on the\nother side. For nothing undid them but that Brutus went not\nto help Cassius, thinking he had overcome them as himself had\ndone; and Cassius on the other side tarried not for Brutus,\nthinking he had been overthrown as himself was. And to prove\nthat the victory fell on Brutus' side, Messala confirmeth, that\nthey \n                   three eagles, and divers other ensigns of the enemies,\nand their enemies wan never a one of theirs. Now Brutus returning from the chase, after he had slain and sacked Caesar's\nmen, he wondered much that he could not see Cassius' tent\nstanding up high as it was wont, neither the other tents of his\ncamp standing as they were before, because all the whole camp\nhad been spoiled, and the tents thrown down, at the first coming\nof their enemies. But they that were about Brutus, whose sight\nserved them better, told them that they saw a great \n                  \nof \n                  , and a number of silvered \n                  , that went and\ncame into Cassius' camp, and were not (as they took it) the armours nor the number of men that they had left there to guard the\ncamp; and yet that they saw not such a number of dead bodies\nand great overthrow as there should have been, if so many\nlegions had been slain. This made Brutus at the first \n                  \nthat which had happened. So he appointed a number of men to\nkeep the camp of his enemy which he had taken, and caused his\nmen to be sent for that yet followed the chase, and gathered\nthem together, thinking to lead them to aid Cassius, who was\nin this state as you shall hear. \n\n\n                  First of all, he was marvellous\nangry to see how Brutus' men ran to give charge upon their\nenemies, and tarried not for the word of the battle, nor commandment to give charge: and it grieved him beside, that after\nhe had overcome them, his men fell straight to spoil, and were\nnot careful to compass in the rest of the enemies behind: but\nwith tarrying too long also, more than through the valiantness\nor foresight of the captains his enemies, Cassius found himself\ncompassed in with the right wing of his enemy's army. Whereupon his horsemen brake immediately, and fled for life towards\n\nthe sea. Furthermore perceiving his footmen to give ground,\nhe did what he could to keep them from flying, and took an\nensign from one of the ensign-bearers that fled, and stuck it fast\nat his feet: although with much ado he could scant keep his\nown guard together.\n\n So Cassius himself was at length compelled to fly, with\na few about him, unto a little hill, from whence they might easily\nsee what was done in all thc plain: howbeit Cassius himself saw\nnothing, for his sight was very bad, saving that he saw (and yet\nwith much ado) how the enemies spoiled his camp before his\neyes. He saw also a great \n                   of horsemen, whom Brutus\nsent to aid him, and thought that they were his enemies\nthat followed him: but yet he sent Titinnius, one of them that\nwas with him, to go and know what they were. Brutus' horsemen saw him coming afar off, whom when they knew that he\nwas one of Cassius' chiefest friends, they shouted out for joy;\nand they that were familiarly acquainted with him lighted from\ntheir horses, and went and embraced him. The rest compassed\nhim in round about on horseback, with songs of victory and\ngreat \n                   of their \n                  , so that they made all the field\nring again for joy. But this marred all. For Cassius, thinking\nindeed that Titinnius was taken of the enemies, he then spake\nthese words: \"Desiring too much to live, I have lived to see\none of my best friends taken, for my sake, before my face.\"\nAfter that, he got into a tent where nobody was, and took\nPindarus with him, one of his bondsmen whom he reserved ever\nfor such a pinch, since the cursed battle of the Parthians, where\nCrassus was slain, though he notwithstanding scaped from that\noverthrow: but then, casting his cloak over his head, and holding\nout his bare neck unto Pindarus, he gave him his head to be\nstricken off. So the head was found severed from the body:\nbut after that time Pindarus was never seen more. Whereupon\nsome took occasion to say that he had slain his master without\nhis commandment. By and by they knew the horsemen that\ncame towards them, and might see Titinnius crowned with a\ngarland of triumph, who came before with great speed unto\nCassius. But when he perceived, by the cries and tears of his\nfriends which tormented themselves, the misfortune that had\nchanced to his captain Cassius by mistaking, he drew out his\nsword, cursing himself a thousand thnes that he had tarried so\nlong, and so slew himself \n                   in the field. \n\n\n                  Brutus in the\nmean time came forward still, and understood also that Cassius\n\nhad been overthrown: but he knew nothing of his death till he\ncame very near to his camp. So when he was come thither,\nafter he had lamented the death of Cassius, calling him the last\nof all the Romans, being \n                   that Rome should ever\nbreed again so noble and valiant a man as he, he caused his\nbody to be buried, and sent it to the city of Thassos, fearing\nlest his \n                   within his camp should cause great disorder.\nThen he called his soldiers together, and did encourage them\nagain. And when he saw that they had lost all their \n                  ,\nwhich they could not \n                   well, he promised every man of\nthem two thousand drachmas in recompense. After his soldiers\nhad heard his oration, they were all of them prettily cheered\nagain, wondering much at his great liberality, and waited upon\nhim with great cries when he went his way, praising him, for\nthat he only of the four chieftains was not overcome in battle.\nAnd to speak the truth, his deeds shewed that he hoped not in\nvain to be conqueror. For with few legions he had slain and\ndriven all them away that made head against him: and if all his\npeople had fought, and that the most of them had not outgone\ntheir enemies to run to spoil their goods, surely it was like\nenough he had slain them all, and had left never a man of them\nalive. \n\n\n                  There were slain of Brutus' side about eight thousand\nmen, counting the soldiers' slaves, whom Brutus called Brigas:\nand of the enemy's side, as Messala writeth, there were slain, as\nhe supposeth, more than twice as many \n                  . Wherefore they\nwere more discouraged than Brutus, until that, very late at\nnight, there was one of Cassius' men called Demetrius, who\nwent unto Antonius, and carried his master's clothes, whereof he\nwas stripped not long before, and his sword also. This encouraged Brutus' enemies, and made them so brave, that the next\nmorning betimes they stood in battle \n                   again before Brutus.\n\n But on Brutus' side, both his camps stood wavering,\nand that in great danger. For his own camp, being full of\nprisoners, required a good guard to look unto them: and\nCassius' camp on the other side took the death of their\ncaptain very heavily; and beside, there was some vile grudge\nbetween them that were overcome and those that did overcome. For this cause therefore Brutus did set them in\nbattle ray6, but yet kept himself from giving battle. Now for\nthe slaves that were prisoners, which were a great number,\nand went and came to and fro amongst these armed men, not\nwithout suspicion, he commanded they should kill them. But\n\n\nfor the free men, he sent them freely home, and said that they\nwere better prisoners with his enemies than with him. For\nwith them, they were slaves and servants: and with him, they\nwere free men and citizens. So when he saw that divers captains and his friends did so cruelly hate some, that they would\nby no means save their lives, Brutus himself hid them, and\nsecretly sent them away. Among these prisoners, there was one\nVolumnius, a jester, and Sacculio, a common player, of whom\nBrutus made no account at all. Howbeit his friends brought\nthem unto him, and did accuse them, that though they were\nprisoners, they did not \n                   to laugh them to scorn, and to jest\nbroadly with them. Brutus made no answer to it, because his\nhead was occupied otherwise. Whereupon Messala Corvinus\nsaid that it were good to whip them on a scaffold, and then to\nsend them naked, well whipped, unto the captains of their\nenemies, to shew them their shame, to keep such \n                   as\nthose in their camp, to play the fools to make them sport. Some\nthat stood by laughed at his device. But Publius Casca, that\ngave Julius Caesar the first wound when he was slain, said then:\n\"It doth not become us to be thus merry at Cassius' \n                  :\nand for thee, Brutus, thou shalt shew what estimation thou\nmadest of such a captain thy compeer, by putting to death, or\nsaving the lives of these \n                  , who hereafter will mock him\nand defame his memory.\" Brutus answered again in choler:\n\"Why then do you come to tell me of it, Casca, and do not\nyourselves what you think good?\" When they heard him say so,\nthey took his answer for a consent against these poor unfortunate men, to suffer them to do what they thought good: and\ntherefore they carried them away, and slew them. \n\nAfterwards\nBrutus performed the promise he had made to the soldiers, and\ngave them the two thousand drachmas apiece; but yet he first\nreproved them, because they went and gave charge upon the\nenemies at the first battle, before they had the word of battle\ngiven them: and made them a new promise also, that if in the\nsecond battle they fought like men, he would give them the sack\nand spoil of two cities, to \n                  , Thessalonica and Lacedaemon.\nIn all Brutus' life there is but this only fault to be found, and\nthat is not to be gainsaid: though Antonius and Octavius Caesar\ndid reward their soldiers far worse for their victory. For when\nthey had driven all the natural Italians out of Italy, they gave\ntheir soldiers their lands and towns, to the which they had no\nright: and moreover the only mark they shot at in all this war\n\nthey made, was but to overcome and reign: where in contrary\nmanner they had so great an opinion of Brutus' virtue, that the\ncommon voice and opinion of the world would not suffer him\nneither to overcome nor to save himself otherwise than justly\nand honestly, and specially after Cassius' death; whom men\n\n                  , that oftentimes he moved Brutus to great cruelty.\nBut now, like as the mariners on the sea, after the rudder of their\nship is broken by tempest, do seek to nail on some other piece\nof wood in \n                   thereof, and do help themselves to keep them\nfrom hurt, as much as may be, upon that \n                   danger: even\nso Brutus, having such a great army to govern, and his affairs\nstanding very \n                  , and having no other captain coequal uith\nhim in dignity and authority, he was forced to employ them he\nhad; and likewise to be ruled by them in many things, and was\nof mind himself also to grant them any thing that he thought\nmight make them serve like noble soldiers at time of need. For\nCassius' soldiers were very evil to be ruled, and did shew themselves very stubborn and \n                   in the camp, because they had\nno chieftain that did command them: but yet rank cowards to\ntheir enemies, because they had once overcome them. \n\nOn the\nother side, Octavius Caesar and Antonius were not in much\nbetter state; for first of all they lacked victuals. And because\nthey were lodged in low places, they \n                   to abide a hard and\nsharp winter, being camped as they were by the \n                   side:\nand also for that, after the battle, there had fallen plenty of rain\nabout the autumn, \n                   all their tents were full of mire\nand dirt, the which by reason of the cold did freeze \n                  .\nBut beside all these discommodities, there came news unto them\nof the great loss they had of their men by sea.  For Brutus'\nships met with a great aid and supply of men, which were sent\nthem out of Italy, and they overthrew them in such sort, that\nthere scaped but few of them: and yet they were so famished,\nthat they were compelled to eat the tackle and sails of their ships.\nThereupon they were very desirous to fight a battle again, before\nBrutus should have intelligence of this good news for him: for\nit chanced so, that the battle was fought by sea, on the selfsame\nday it was fought by land. But by ill fortune, rather than\nthrough the malice or negligence of the captains, this victory\ncame not to Brutus' ear till twenty days after. For had he\nknown of it before, he would not have been brought to have\nfought a second battle, considering that he had excellent good\nprovision for his army for a long time; and besides lay in a\n\n\nplace of great strength, so as his camp could not greatly be\nhurt by the winter, nor also distressed by his enemies: and\nfurther, he had been a quiet lord, being a conqueror by sea, as\nhe was also by land. This would have marvellously encouraged\nhim. Howbeit the state of Rome (in my opinion) being now\nbrought to that pass, that it could no more abide to be governed\nby many lords, but required one only absolute governor: God,\nto prevent Brutus that it should not come to his government, \nkept this victory from his knowledge, though indeed it came but \na little too late. For the day before the last battle was given,\nvery late in the night, came Clodius, one of his enemies, into his\ncamp, who told that Caesar, hearing of the overthrow of his army\nby sea, desired nothing more than to fight a battle before Brutus\nunderstood it. Howbeit they gave no credit to his words, but\ndespised him so much, that they would not vouchsafe to bring\nhim unto Brutus, because they thought it but a lie devised, to\nbe the better welcome for this good news. \n\n\n                  The selfsame night, \nit is reported that the monstrous spirit which had appeared before unto Brutus in the city of Sardis, did now appear again unto\nhim in the selfsame shape and form, and so vanished away, and\nsaid never a word. Now Publius Volumnius, a grave and wise\nphilosopher, that had been with Brutus from the beginning of\nthis war, doth make no mention of this spirit; but saith that the\ngreatest eagle and ensign was covered over with a swarm of\nbees; and that there was one of the captains, whose arm suddenly\nfell a sweating, that it dropped oil of roses from him, and that\nthey oftentimes went \n                   to dry him, but all would do no\ngood. And that, before the battle was fought, there were two \neagles fought between both armies, and all the time they fought \nthere was a marvellous great silence all the valley over, both the \narmies being one before the other, marking this fight between,\nthem; and that in the end, the eagle towards Brutus gave over \nand fled away. But this is certain, and a true tale, that when \nthe gate of the camp was open, the first man the standardbearer met that carried the eagle, was an Aethiopian, whom the \nsoldiers, for ill luck, mangled with their swords. \n\n\n                   \n                  Now after that Brutus had brought his army into the \nfield, and had set them in battle \n                  , directly against the\n\n                   of his enemy, he paused a long time before he gave\nthe signal of battle. For Brutus riding up and down to view\nthe bands and companies, it canme in his head to mistrust some\nof them, besides that some came to tell him so much as he\n\nthought. Moreover, he saw his horsemen set forward but faintly,\nand did not go lustily to give charge, but still stayed to see what\nthe footmen would do. Then suddenly, one of the chiefest\nknights he had in all his army, called Camulatius, and that was\nalway marvellously esteemed of for his valiantness, until that\ntime: he came hard by Brutus on horseback, and rode before\nhis face to yield himself unto his enemies. Brutus was marvellous sorry for it: wherefore, partly for anger, and partly for fear\nof greater treason and rebellion, he suddenly caused his army to\nmarch, being past three of the clock in the afternoon. So in\nthat place where he himself fought in person, he had the better,\nand brake into the left wing of his enemies; which gave him\nway, through the help of his horsemen that gave charge with his\nfootmen, when they saw the enemies in a \n                   and afraid.\nHowbeit, the other also on the right wing, when the captains\nwould have had them to have marched, they were afraid to have\nbeen compassed in behind, because they were fewer in number\nthan their enemies, and therefore did spread themselves, and\nleave the \n                   of the battle. Whereby they having weakened themselves, they could not withstand the force of their\nenemies, but turned tail straight and fled. And those that had\nput them to flight, came in straight upon it to compass Brutus\nbehind, who, in the \n                   of the conflict, did all that was\npossible for a skilful captain and valiant soldier, both for his\nwisdom, as also his hardiness, for the obtaining of victory. But\nthat which \n                   him the victory at the first battle, did now lose\nit him at the second. For at the first time, the enemies that\nwere broken and fled were straight cut in pieces: but at the\nsecond battle, of Cassius' men that were put to flight, there\nwere few slain: and they that saved themselves by speed, being\nafraid because they had been overcome, did discourage the rest\nof the army when they came to join with them, and filled all the\narmy with fear and disorder. There was the son of Marcus\nCato slain, valiantly fighting among the lusty youths. For notwithstanding that he was very weary and \n                  , yet\nwould he not therefore fly, but manfully fighting and laying\nabout him, telling aloud his name, and also his father's name, at\nlength he was beaten down amongst many other dead bodies of\nhis enemies, which he had slain round about him. So there\nwere slain in the field all the chiefest gentlemen and nobility\nthat were in his army, who valiantly ran into any danger to save\nBrutus' life: \n\namongst whom there was one of Brutus' friends\n\ncalled Lucilius, who seeing a \n                   of barbarous men making\nno reckoning of all men else they met in their way, but going\nall together right against Brutus, he determined to stay them with\nthe hazard of his life; and being left behind, told them that he\nwas Brutus: and because they should believe him, he prayed\nthem to bring him to Antonius, for he said he was afraid of\nCaesar, and that he did trust Antonius better. These barbarous\nmen, being very glad of this good hap, and thinking themselves\nhappy men, they carried him in the night, and sent some before\nunto Antonius, to tell him of their coming. He was marvellous\nglad of it, and went out to meet them that brought him. Others\nalso understanding of it, that they had brought Brutus prisoner,\nthey came out of all parts of the camp to see him, some pitying\nhis hard fortune, and others saying that it was not done like himself, so cowardly to be taken alive of the barbarous people for\nfear of death. When they came near together, Antonius stayed\na while bethinking himself how he should use Brutus. In the\nmeantime Lucilius was brought to him, who stoutly with a bold\ncountenance said: \"Antonius, I dare assure thee, that no enemy\nhath taken nor shall take Marcus Brutus alive, and I beseech God\nkeep him from that fortune: for wheresoever he be found, alive\nor dead, he will be found like himself. And now for myself, I\nam come unto thee, having deceived these men of arms here,\nbearing them \n                   that I was Brutus, and do not refuse to\nsuffer any torment thou wilt put me to.\" Lucilius' words made\nthem all amazed that heard him. Antonius on the other side,\nlooking upon all them that had brought him, said unto them:\n\" My companions, I think ye are sorry you have failed of your\npurpose, and that you think this man hath done you great wrong:\nbut I assure you, you have taken a better booty than that you followed. For instead of an enemy you have brought me a friend:\nand for my part, if you had brought me Brutus alive, truly I\ncannot tell what I should have done to him. For I had rather\nhave such men my friends, as this man here, than mine enemies.\"\nThen he embraced Lucilius, and at that time delivered him to one\nof his friends in custody; and Lucilius ever after served him\nfaithfully, even to his death. \n\n\n                  Now Brutus having passed a little\nriver, walled in on every side with high rocks and shadowed with\ngreat trees, being then dark night, he went no further, but stayed\nat the foot of a rock with certain of his captains and friends that\nfollowed him: and looking up to the firmament that was full of\n\nstars, sighing, he rehearsed two verses, of the which Volumnius\nwrote the one, to this effect:\n\n\n\nand saith that he had forgotten the other. Within a little while\nafter, naming his friends that he had seen slain in battle before\nhis eyes, he fetched a greater sigh than before, specially when he\ncame to name Labio and Flavius, of whom the one was his\nlieutenant, and the other captain of the \n                   of his camp.\nIn the meantime one of the company being athirst, and seeing\nBrutus athirst also, he ran to the river for water, and brought it\nin his \n                  . At the same time they heard a noise on the other\nside of the river: whereupon Volumnius took Dardanus, Brutus'\nservant, with him, to see what it was: and returning straight\nagain, asked if there were any water left. Brutus smiling, gently\ntold him, \"All is \n                  , but they shall bring you some more.\"\nThereupon he sent him again that went for water before, who\nwas in great danger of being taken by the enemies, and hardly\nescaped, being sore hurt.\n\n Furthermore, Brutus thought that there was no great\nnumber of men slain in battle: and to know the truth of it, there\nwas one called Statilius, that promised to go through his enemies,\nfor otherwise it was impossible to go see their camp: and from\nthence, if all were well, that he would lift up a torch-light in\nthe air, and then return again with speed to him. The torchlight was \n                   up as he had promised, for Statilius went thither.\nNow Brutus seeing Statilius tarry long after that, and that he\ncame not again, he said: \" If Statilius be alive, he will come\nagain.\" But his evil fortune was such that, as he came back, he\nlighted in his enemies' hands and was slain. \n\nNow the night\nbeing far spent, Brutus as he sat bowed towards Clitus, one of his\nmen, and told him somewhat in his ear: the other answered him\nnot, but fell a-weeping. Thereupon he \n                   Dardanus, and\nsaid somewhat also to him: at length he came to Volumnius himself, and speaking to him in Greek, prayed him for the studies' \nsake\nwhich brought them acquainted together, that he would help him\nto put his hand to his sword, to thrust it in him to kill him.\nVolumnius denied his request, and so did many others: and\namongst the rest, one of them said, there was no tarrying for\nthem there, but that they must needs fly. Then Brutus, rising\nup, \"We must fly indeed,\" said he, \"but it must be with our\n\nhands, not with our feet.\" Then taking every man by the hand,\nhe said these words unto them with a cheerful countenance: \" It\nrejoiceth my heart, that not one of my friends hath failed me at\nmy need, and I do not complain of my fortune, but only for my\ncountry's sake: for as for me, I think myself happier than they\nthat have overcome, considering that I \n                  . a perpetual fame\nof virtue and \n                  , dagger; the which our enemies the conquerors\nshall never attain unto by force or money; neither can \n                   their\nposterity to say that they, being \n                   and unjust men, have\nslain good men, to usurp tyrannical power not pertaining to\nthem.\" Having so said, he prayed every man to shift for himself, and then he went a little aside with two or three only,\namong the which Strato was one, with whom he came first acquainted by the study of rhetoric. He came as near to him\nas he could, and taking his sword by the hilt with both his\nhands, and falling down upon the point of it, ran himself through.\nOthers say that not he, but Strato (at his request) held the sword\nin his hand, and turned his head aside, and that Brutus fell\ndown upon it, and so ran himself through, and died \n                  .\n\n\nMessala, that had been Brutus' great friend, became afterwards\nOctavius Caesar's friend: so, shortly after, Caesar being at good\nleisure, he brought Strato, Brutus' friend, unto him, and weeping\nsaid: \" Caesar, behold, here is he that did the last service to my\nBrutus.\" Caesar welcomed him at that time, and afterwards\nhe did him as faithful service in all his affairs as any Grecian\nelse he had about him, until the battle of Actium. It is reported also that this Messala himself answered Caesar one\nday, when he gave him great praise before his face, that he had\nfought valiantly and with great affection for him at the battle of\nActium (notwithstanding that he had been his cruel enemy\nbefore, at the battle of \n                  , for Brutus' sake): \"I ever\nloved,\" said he, \"to take the best and justest part.\" Now Antonius having found Brutus' body, he caused it to be wrapped\nup in one of the richest \n                   he had. Afterwards also,\nAntonius understanding that this coat-armour was stolen, he\nput the \n                   to death that had stolen it, and sent the ashes of\nhis body unto Servilia his mother. And for Porcia, Brutus'\nwife, Nicolaus the Philosopher and Valerius Maximus do write,\nthat she, determining to kill herself (her parents and friends\ncarefully looking to her to keep her from it), took hot burning\ncoals and cast them into her mouth, and kept her mouth so close\nthat she choked herself. There was a letter of Brutus found\n\nwritten to his friends, complaining of their negligence, that, his\nwife being sick, they would not \n                   her, but suffered her to kill\nherself; choosing to die, rather than to languish in pain. Thus\nit appeareth that Nicolaus knew not well that time, \n                   the\nletter (at the least if it were Brutus' letter) doth plainly declare\nthe disease and love of this lady, and also the manner of her\ndeath."}}}, {"@n": "Ant.", "front": {"div": {"@type": "toc", "pb": {"@n": "153"}, "head": "The Life of Marcus Antonius", "list": {"@type": "simple", "item": [{"ref": {"@n": "para. 1", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "I.

"#text": "Moon"}], "#text": "Antonius, grandfather was that famous orator whom\nMarius slew because he took Sylla's part. His father was\nanother Antonius \n\n                  , who was not so famous,\nnor bare any great sway in the commonwealth: howbeit other\nwise he was an honest man, and of a very good nature, and\n\nspecially very liberal in giving, as appeareth by an act he did.\nHe was not very wealthy, and therefore his wife would not let\nhim use his liberality and frank nature. One day a friend of his\ncoming to him to pray him to help him to some money, having\ngreat need, Antonius by chance had no money to give him, but\nhe commanded one of his men to bring him some water in a\nsilver basin, and after he had brought it him, he washed his\nbeard as though he meant to have shaven it, and then found an\n\n\n                   for his man to send him out, and gave his friend the\nsilver basin, and bade him get him money with that. Shortly\nafter' there was a great stir in the house among the servants,\nseeking out of this silver basin. Insomuch as Antonius, seeing \nhis\nwife marvellously offended for it, and that she would examine all\nher servants one affair another about it, to know what was be\ncome of it, at length he confessed he had given it away, and\nprayed her to be contented. \n\n\n                  His wife was Julia, of the noble\nhouse and family of Julius Caesar: who, for her virtue and chastity, \nwas to be compared with the noblest lady of her time.\nMarcus Antonius was brought up under her, being married\nafter her first husband's death unto Cornelius Lentulus, whom\nCicero put to death with Cethegus and others, for that he\nwas of Catiline's conspiracy against the Commonwealth. And\nthis seemeth to be the original cause and beginning of the cruel\nand mortal hate Antonius bare unto Cicero. For Antonius self\nsaith, that \n\n                   would never give him the body of his father-in-law\nto bury him, before his mother went first to entreat Cicero's\nwife the which undoubtedly was a flat lie. For Cicero denied\nburial to none of them whom he executed by law. Now Antonius\nbeing a fair young man, and in the prime of his youth, he fell\nacquainted with Curio, whose friendship and acquaintance (as it\nis reported) was a plague unto him. For he was a dissolute\nman, given over to all lust and insolency, who, to have Antonius\nthe better at his commandment, \n\n                   him on into great follies\nand vain expenses upon women, in rioting and banqueting: so\nthat in short time he brought Antonius into a marvellous great\ndebt, and too great for one of his years, \n\n                  , of two hundred and fifty talents, for all which sum Curio was surety.  His father hearing of it, did put his son from him, and forbad him\nhis house. Then he fell in with Clodius, one of the desperatest\nand most wicked tribunes at that time in Rome. Him he\n\nfollowed for a time in his desperate attempts, who bred great\nstir and mischief in Rome: but at length he forsook him, being\n\n\nweary of his rashness and folly, or else for that he was afraid of\nthem that were bent against Clodius.\n\n Thereupon he left Italy, and went into Greece, and there\n\n\n                   the most part of his time, sometime in wars, and\notherwhile in the study of eloquence. He used a manner of\nphrase in his speech called Asiatic, which carried the best\ngrace and estimation at that time, and was much like to his\nmanners and life: for it was full of ostentation, foolish \n\n                  ,\nand vain ambition. \n\nAfter he had remained there some time.\nGabinius, proconsul, going into Syria, persuaded him to go with\nhim; Antonius told him he would not go as a private man:\nwherefore  Gabinius gave him charge of his horsemen, and so\ntook him with him. So, first of all he sent him against Aristobulus, \nwho had made the Jews to rebel, and was the first man\nhimself that got up to the wall of a castle of his, and so drove\nAristobulus out of all his holds: and with those few men he had\nwith him, he overcame all the Jews in set battle, which were\nmany against one, and put all of them almost to the sword ; and\nfurthermore, took Aristobulus himself prisoner with his son.\nAfterwards Ptolemy, king of Egypt, that had been driven out of\nhis country, went unto Gabinius to intreat him to go with his\narmy with him into Egypt, to put him again into his kingdom:\nand promised him, if he would go with him, ten thousand talents.\nThe most part of the captains thought it not best to go thither, and\nGabinius himself \n\n                   into this war, although\nthe covetousness of \nthese\n10,000 talents stuck sorely with him.\nBut Antonius, that sought but for opportunity and good occasion\nto attempt great enterprises, and that desired also to gratify\nPtolemy's request, he went about to persuade Gabinius to go\nthis voyage. Now they were more afraid of the way they should\ngo, to come to the city of Pelusium, than they feared any danger\nof the war besides because they were to pass through deep\nsands and desert places, where was no fresh water to be had all\nthe marishes; through, which are called the \n\n                   Serbonides,\nwhich the Egyptians call the exhalations or fume, by the which\nthe giant Typhon breathed. But in truth it appeareth to be the\noverflowing of the Red Sea, which breaketh out under the ground\nin that place where it is divided in the narrowest place from the\nsea on this side. So Antonius was sent before into Egypt with\nhis horsemen, who did not only win that passage, but also took\nthe city of Pelusium (which is a great city) with all the soldiers in\nit: and thereby he cleared the way, and made it safe for all the\n\n\nrest of the army, and the hope of the victory also certain for his\ncaptain. Now did the enemies themselves feel the fruits of\nAntonius' courtesy, and the desire he had to win honour: for\nwhen Ptolemy (after he had entered into the city of Pelusium),\nfor the malice he bare unto the city, would have put all the\nEgyptians in it to the sword, Antonius withstood him, and by no\nmeans would suffer him to do it. And in all other great battles\nand skirmishes which they fought, being many in number, Antonius \ndid many noble acts of a valiant and wise captain: but\nspecially in one battle, where he compassed in the enemies\nbehind, giving them the victory that fought in front, whereby he\nafterwards had such honourable reward as his valiantness de\nserved. So was his great courtesy also much commended of all,\nthe which he shewed unto Archelaus: for having been his very\nfriend, he made war with him against his will while he lived;\nbut after his death he fought for his body, and gave it honour\nable burial. For these respects he \n\n                   himself great fame of them\nof Alexandria, and he was also thought a worthy man of all the\nsoldiers in the Romans' camp. \n\nBut besides all this, he had a\nnoble presence, and shewed a countenance of one of a noble\nhouse: he had a goodly thick beard, a broad forehead, crooked\nnosed, and there appeared such a manly look in his countenance,\nas is commonly seen in Hercules, pictures, stamped or graven in\nmetal. Now it had been a speech of old time, that the family of the\nAntonii were descended from one Anton the son of Hercules,\nwhereof the family took name. This opinion did Antonius seek\nto confirm in all his doings: not only resembling him in the\nlikeness of his body, as we have said before, but also in the\nwearing of his garments. For when he would openly shew him\nself abroad before many people, he would always wear his \n\n\n                  : girt down low upon his hips, with a great sword hanging\nby his side, and \n\n                   that, some ill-favoured cloak. Further\nmore, things that seem intolerable in other men, as to boast\ncommonly, to jest with one or other, to drink like a good fellow\nwith everybody, to sit with the soldiers when they dine, and to\neat and drink with them soldier-like, it is incredible what \nwonderful love it \n\n                   him amongst them. And furthermore, being\ngiven to love, that made him the more desired, and by that\nmeans he brought many to love him. For he would further\neveryman's love, and also would not be angry that men should\nmerrily tell him of those he loved. But besides all this, that which\nmost procured his rising and advancement, was his liberality,\n\n\nwho gave all to the soldiers, and kept nothing for himself: and\nwhen he was grown to great credit, then was his authority and\npower also very great, the which notwithstanding himself did\noverthrow by a thousand other faults he had. In this place I\nwill shew you one example only of his wonderful liberality. He\ncommanded one day his \n\n                   that kept his money, to give a\nfriend of his five and twenty myriads, which the Romans call in\ntheir tongue . His cofferer marvelling at it, and being\nangry withal in his mind, brought him all this money in a heap\ntogether, to shew him what a marvellous mass of money it was.\nAntonius seeing it as he went by, asked what it was: the cofferer\nanswered him, \"It was the money he willed him to give unto his\nfriend.\" Then Antonius, perceiving the spite of his man, \"I\nthought,\" said he, \"that  had been a greater sum of \nmoney\nthan it is, for this is but a trifle:\" and therefore he gave his \nfriend as much more another time, but that was afterwards.\n\n\n                   Now the Romans maintaining two factions at Rome at\nthat time, one against the other, of the which they that took\npart with the Senate did join with Pompey, being then in Rome:\nand the contrary side, taking part with the people, sent for Caesar\nto aid them, who made wars in Gaul: then Curio, Antonius'\nfriend, that had changed his garments, and at that time took\npart with Caesar, whose enemy he had been before, he wan\nAntonius; and so handled the matter, partly through the great\ncredit and sway he bare amongst the people, by reason of his\neloquent tongue, and partly also by his exceeding expense of\nmoney he made which Caesar gave him, that Antonius was\nchosen tribune, and afterwards made augur. But this was a great\nhelp and furtherance to Caesar's \n\n                  . For so soon as \nAntonius became tribune, he did oppose himself against those things\nwhich the Consul Marcellus preferred (who ordained that certain\nlegions which had been already levied and \n\n                  , should be given\nunto Cneus Pompey, with further commission and authority to\nlevy others unto them), and set down an order, that the soldiers\nwhich were already levied and assembled should be sent into\nSyria, for a new supply unto Marcus Bibulus, who made war\nat that time against the Parthians. And further gave a prohibition\n that Pompey should levy no more men, and also that\nthe soldiers should not obey him. Secondly, where Pompey's\nfriends and followers would not suffer Caesar's letters to be received\n and openly read in the senate, Antonius, having power\nand warrant by his person, through the holiness of his tribuneship, \n\n\ndid read them openly, and made divers men change their\nminds: for it appeared to them that Caesar by his letters \nrequired no unreasonable matters. At length, when they preferred\ntwo matters of consideration unto the Senate, whether they\nthought good that Pompey or Caesar should leave their army,\nthere were few of the senators that thought it meet Pompey\nshould leave his army, but they \n\n                   commanded\nCaesar to do it. Then Antonius rising up, asked whether they\nthought it good that Pompey and Caesar both should leave their\narmies. Thereupon all the senators jointly together gave their\nwhole consent, and with a great cry commending Antonius, they\nprayed him to refer it to the judgment of the senate. But the\nConsuls would not allow of that. Therefore Caesar's friends\npreferred other reasonable demands and requests again, but\nCato spake against them: and Lentulus, one of the Consuls,\ncrave Antonius by force out of the Senate, who at his going out\nmade grievous curses against him. After that, he took a slave's\ngown, and speedily fled to Caesar, with Quintus Cassius, in a\nhired coach. When they came to Caesar, they cried out with\nopen mouth, that all went hand over \n\n                   at Rome: for the\ntribunes of the people might not speak their minds; and were\ndriven away in great danger of their lives, as many as \n\n\n                   law and justice. \n\nHereupon Caesar went \n\n                  \ninto Italy with his army, which made Cicero say in his \nPhilippides: \"That, as Helen was cause of the war of Troy, so was\nAntonius the author of the civil wars;\" which indeed was a\n\n\n                   lie. For Caesar was not so fickle-headed, nor so easily\ncarried away with anger, that he would so suddenly have gone\nand made war with his country, upon the sight only of \nAntonius and Cassius, being fled to him in miserable apparel, and\nin a hired coach, had he not long before determined it with\nhimself. But sith indeed Caesar looked of long time but for\nsome \n\n                  , this came as he wished, and gave him just \noccasion of war. But to say truly, nothing else moved him to make\nwar with all the world as he did, but one \n\n                   cause which first\nprocured Alexander and Cyrus also before him, to wit, an \ninsatiable desire to reign, with a senseless covetousness to be the best\nman in the world; the which he could not come unto, before he\nhad first put down Pompey and utterly overthrown him. Now\nafter that Caesar had gotten Rome at his commandment, and\nhad driven Pompey out of Italy, he purposed first to go into\nSpain against the legions Pompey had there, and in the mean\n\n\ntime to make provision for ships and marine preparation, to\nfollow Pompey. In his absence, he left Lepidus, that was Praetor,\ngovernor of Rome; and Antonius, that was tribune, he gave\nhim charge of all the soldiers and of Italy. Then was Antonius\nstraight marvellously commended and beloved of the soldiers,\nbecause he commonly exercised himself among them, and would\noftentimes eat and drink with them, and also be liberal unto\nthem, according to his ability. But then in contrary manner,\nhe purchased divers other men's evil wills, because that through\nnegligence he would not do them justice that were injured, and\ndealt very churlishly with them that had any suit unto him: and\nbesides all this, he had an ill name to \n\n                   men's wives. To\nconclude, Caesar's friends, that governed under him, were cause\nwhy they hated Caesar's government (which indeed in respect of\nhimself was no less than tyranny) by reason of the great \ninsolencies and outrageous parts that were committed: amongst\nwhom Antonius, that was of greatest power, and that also \ncommitted greatest faults, deserved most blame. \n\nBut Caesar, not\nwithstanding, when he returned from the wars of Spain, made\nno reckoning of the complaints that were put up against him:\nbut contrarily, because he found him a hardy man, and a valiant\ncaptain, he employed him in his chiefest affairs, and was no\nwhit deceived in his opinion of him.\n\n So he passed over the Ionian sea unto Brundusium\nbeing but slenderly accompanied, and sent unto Antonius and\nGabinius, that they should \n\n                   their men as soon as they I\ncould, and pass them over into Macedon. Gabinius was afraid\nto take the sea, because it was very rough, and in the winter\ntime: and therefore fetched a great \n\n                   about by land.\nBut Antonius, fearing some danger might come unto Caesar, be\ncause he was compassed in with a great number of enemies\nfirst of all he drave away Libo, who rode at anchor with a great\narmy before the haven of Brundusium. For he manned out\nsuch a number of pinnaces, barks, and other small boats about\nevery one of his galleys, that he crave him thence. After that,\nhe\n\n                   into \nships 20,000 footmen, and 800 horsemen, and\nwith this army he \n\n                   sail. When the enemies saw him,\nthey made out to follow him: but the sea rose so high, that the\nbillows put back their galleys that they could not come near him,\nand so he scaped that danger. But withal he fell upon the rocks\nwith his whole fleet, where the sea wrought very high, so that\nhe was out of all hope to save himself. Yet, by good fortune,\n\n\nsuddenly the wind turned south-west, and blew from the gulf,\ndriving the waves of the river into the main sea. Thus Antonius,\nloosing from the land, and sailing with safety at his pleasure,\nsoon after he saw all the coasts full of \n\n                  . For the\nforce and boisterousness of the wind did cast away the galleys\nthat followed him: of the which, many of them were broken and\n\n\n                  , and divers also cast away; and Antonius took a great\nnumber of them prisoners, with a great sum of money also. Be\nsides all these, he took the city of Lyssus, and brought Caesar a\ngreat supply of men, and made him courageous, coming at a\npinch with so great a power to him. \n\n\n                  Now there were divers hot\nskirmishes and encounters, in the which Antonius fought so\nvaliantly, that he carried the praise from them all: but specially\nat two several times, when Caesar's men turned their backs, and\nfled for life. For he stepped before them, and compelled them\nto return again to fight: so that the victory fell on Caesar's side.\nFor this cause he had the second p]ace in the camp among the\nsoldiers, and they spake of no other man unto Caesar, but of him:\nwho shewed plainly what opinion he had of him, when at the\nlast battle of Pharsalia (which indeed was the last trial of all, to\ngive the conqueror the whole empire of the world) he himself\ndid lead the right wing of his army, and gave Antonius the \nleading of the left wing, as the valiantest man and skilfullest soldier\nof all those he had about him. After Caesar had won the victory,\nand that he was created Dictator, he followed Pompey step by\nstep: howbeit, before, he named Antonius general of the horse\nmen, and sent him to Rome. The general of the horsemen is\nthe second office of dignity, when the Dictator is in the city:\nbut when he is abroad, he is the chiefest man, and almost the\nonly man that remaineth, and all the other officers and \nmagistrates are put down, after there is a Dictator chosen. \n\n\nNotwithstanding, Dolabella, being at that time tribune, and a young\nman desirous of change and innovation, he \n\n                   a law\nwhich the Romans call  (as much to say, as a\ncutting off and cancelling of all obligations and specialities; and\nwere called , because they were driven then to \nmake\nbooks of daily receipt and expense), and persuaded Antonius his\nfriend (who also \n\n                   for a good occasion to please and gratify\nthe common people)to aid him to pass this law. But Trebellius\nand Asinius dissuaded from it all they could possible. So by\ngood hap it chanced that Antonius \n\n                   Dolabella \n\n                  \nkeeping of his wife, and took such a conceit of it, that he thrust\n\n\nhis wife out of his house, being his cousin-german, and the\ndaughter of C. Antonius, who was Consul with Cicero; and joining\nwith Asinius, he resisted Dolabella, and fought with him.\nDolabella had gotten the market-place, where the people do \nassemble in council, and had filled it full of armed men, intending\nto have this law of the New Tables to pass by force. Antonius,\nby commandment of the senate, who had given him authority\nto levy men and to use force against Dolabella, went against\nhim, and fought so valiantly, that men were slain on both sides.\n\n But by this means he got the ill will of the common \npeople; and on the other side, the noblemen (as Cicero saith) did\nnot only mislike him, but also hate him for his \n\n                   life:\nfor they did abhor his banquets and drunken feasts he made at\nunseasonable times, and his extreme wasteful expenses upon\nvain light \n\n                  ; and then in the day-time he would sleep\nor walk out his drunkenness, thinking to wear away the fume of\nthe abundance of wine which he had taken over night. In his\nhouse they did nothing but feast, dance, and mask: and himself\npassed away the time in hearing of foolish plays, and in marrying\nthese players, tumblers, jesters, and such sort of people. As\nfor proof hereof it is reported, that at Hippias' marriage, one of\nhis jesters, he drank wine so lustily all night, that the next morning,\nwhen he came to plead before the people assembled in council,\nwho had sent for him, he being \n\n                   with his \nsurfeit he had taken, was compelled to \n\n                   all before them, and\none of his friends held him his gown instead of a basin. He had\nanother pleasant player called Sergius, that was one of the \nchiefest men about him, and a woman also called Cytheride, of the\nsame profession, whom he loved dearly: he carried her up and\ndown in a litter unto all the towns he went, and had as many\nmen waiting upon her litter (she being but a player) as were \nattending upon his own mother. lt grieved honest men also very\nmuch to see that, when he went into the country, he carried with\nhim a great number of cupboards full of silver and gold plate\nopenly in the face of the world, \n\n                   it had been the pomp or\nshew of some triumph: and that \n\n                   in the \n\n                   of his\njourney he would set up his \n\n                   and tents hard by some green\ngrove or pleasant river, and there his cooks should prepare him\na sumptuous dinner. And furthermore, lions were harnessed in\n\n\n                   to draw his carts: and besides also, in honest men's\nhouses, in the cities where he came, he would have common\nharlots, courtesans, and these tumbling \n\n                   lodged. Now it\n\ngrieved men much to see that Caesar should be out of Italy \nfollowing of his enemies, to end this great war with such greet peril\nand danger, and that others in the mean time, abusing his name\nand authority, should commit such insolent and outrageous parts\nupon their citizens. \n\nThis methinks was the cause that made the\nconspiracy against Caesar increase more and more, and laid the\nreins of the bridle upon the soldiers' necks, whereby they durst\nmore boldly commit many extortions, cruelties, and robberies.\nAnd therefore Caesar after his return pardoned Dolabella, and\nbeing created Consul the third time, he took not Antonius, but\nchose Lepidus his colleague and fellow-consul. Afterwards when\nPompey's house was put to open sale, Antonius bought it: but\nwhen they asked him money for it, he \n\n                  , and\nwas offended with them; and writeth himself that he would not\ngo with Caesar into the wars of Africa, because he was not well\nrecompensed for the service he had done him before. Yet\nCaesar did somewhat bridle his madness and insolency, not\nsuffering him to pass his faults so lightly away, making as though\nhe saw them not. And therefore he left his dissolute manner of\nlife, and married Fulvia that was Clodius' widow, a woman not\nso basely minded \n\n                   spend her time in spinning and housewifery; \nand was not contented to master her husband at home,\nbut would also rule him in his office abroad, and commanded\nhim that commanded legions and great armies: so that Cleopatra\nwas to give Fulvia thanks for that she had taught Antonius this\nobedience to women, that learned so well to be at their \ncommandment. Now, because Fulvia was somewhat sour and\ncrooked of \n\n                  , Antonius devised to make her pleasanter,\nand somewhat better disposed: and therefore he would play her\nmany pretty youthful parts to make her merry. As he did once,\nwhen Caesar returned the last time of all conqueror out of Spain,\nevery man went out to meet him, and so did Antonius with the\nrest. But on the sudden there ran a rumour through Italy, that\nCaesar was dead, and that his enemies came again with a great\narmy. Thereupon he returned with speed to Rome, and took\none of his men's gowns, and so apparelled came home to his\nhouse in a dark night, saying, that he had brought Fulvia letters\nfrom Antonius. So he was let in and brought to her muffled as\nhe was, \n\n                   being known: but she, taking the matter heavily,\nasked him if Antonius were well. Antonius gave her the letters,\nand said never a word. So when she had opened the letters,\nand began to read them, Antonius \n\n                   on her neck, and\n\n\nkissed her. We have told you this tale for example's sake only,\nand so could we also tell you of many such like as these.\n\n\n                   Now when Caesar was returned from his last war in\nSpain, all the chiefest nobility of the city rode many days journey\nfrom Rome to meet him, where Caesar made marvellous\nmuch of Antonius above all the men that came unto him. For\nhe always took him into his coach with him throughout all Italy,\nand behind him Brutus Albinus and Octavius the son of his\nniece, who afterwards was called Caesar, and became Emperor\nof Rome long time after. So Caesar being afterwards chosen\nConsul the \n\n                  time, he immediately chose Antonius his \ncolleague and companion; and desired, by deposing himself of his\nconsulship, to make Dolabella Consul in his room, and had\nalready moved it to the senate. But Antonius did stoutly\nwithstand it, and openly reviled Dolabella in the Senate, and\nDolabella also spared him as little. Thereupon Caesar being\nashamed of the matter, he let it alone. Another time also, when\nCaesar attempted again to substitute Dolabella Consul in his\nplace, Antonius cried out, that the signs of the birds were\nagainst it: so that at length Caesar was compelled to give him\nplace, and to let Dolabella alone, who was marvellously offended\nwith him. Now in truth Caesar made no great reckoning of\neither of them both. For it is reported that Caesar answered\none that did accuse Antonius and Dolabella unto him for some\nmatter of conspiracy: \"Tush,\" said he, \"they be not those fat\nfellows and fine combed men that I fear, but I mistrust rather\nthese pale and lean men,\" \n\n                   Brutus and Cassius, who\nafterwards conspired his death and slew him. \n\n                  Antonius, \nunawares, afterwards gave Caesar's enemies just \n\n                   and\n\n\n                   to do as they did: as you shall hear. The Romans by\nchance celebrated the feast called Lupercalia, and Caesar, being\napparelled in his triumphing robe, was set in the Tribune where\nthey use to make their orations to the people, and from thence\ndid behold the sport of the runners. The manner of this running\nwas thus. On that day there are many young men of noble\nhouse, and those specially that be chief officers for that year,\nwho running naked up and down the city, anointed with the oil\nof olive, for pleasure do strike them they meet in their way with\nwhite leather thongs they have in their hands. Antonius, being\none among the rest that was to run, leaving the ancient \nceremonies and old customs of that solemnity, he ran to the tribune\nwhere Caesar was set, and carried a laurel crown in his hand,\n\n\n having a royal band or diadem wreathed about it, which in old\ntime was the ancient mark and token of a king. When he was\ncome to Caesar, he made his fellow-runners with him lift him up,\nand so he did put his laurel crown upon his head, signifying\nthereby that he had deserved to be king. But Caesar, making as\nthough he refused it, turned away his head. The people were\nso rejoiced at it, that they all clapped their hands for joy. Antonius \nagain did put it on his head: Caesar again refused it ; and\nthus they were striving off and on a great while together. he\noft as Antonius did put this laurel crown unto him, a few of his\nfollowers rejoiced at it: and as oft also as Caesar refused it, all\nthe people together clapped their hands. And this was a wonderful\nthing, that they suffered all things subjects should do by\ncommandment of their kings: and yet they could not abide the\nname of a king, detesting it as the utter destruction of their\nliberty. Caesar, in a rage, arose out of his seat, and plucking\ndown the collar of his gown from his neck, he shewed it naked,\nbidding any man strike off his head that would. This laurel\ncrown was afterwards put upon the head of one of Caesar's\nstatues or images, the which one of the tribunes plucked off.\nThe people liked his doing therein so well, that they waited on\nhim home to his house, with great clapping of hands. Howbeit\nCaesar did turn them out of their offices for it.\n\n\n                   \n                  This was a good encouragement for Brutus and Cassius\nto conspire his death, who fell into a \n\n                   with their \ntrustiest friends, to execute their enterprise, but yet stood doubtful\nwhether they should make Antonius privy to it or not. All the\nrest \n\n                   it, saving Trebonius only. He told them that,\nwhen they rode to meet Caesar at his return out of Spain, Antonius\n and he always keeping company, and lying together by\nthe way, he felt his mind afar off: but Antonius, finding his\nmeaning, would hearken no more unto it, and yet notwithstanding\nnever made Caesar acquainted with this talk, but had faith\nfully kept it to himself. After that, they consulted whether they\nshould kill Antonius with Caesar. But Brutus would in no wise\nconsent to it, saying, that venturing on such an enterprise as\nthat, for the maintenance of law and justice, it ought to be clear\nfrom all villany. Yet they, fearing Antonius' power, and the\nauthority of his office, appointed certain of the conspiracy, that\nwhen Caesar were gone into the senate, and while others should\nexecute their enterprise, they should keep Antonius in a talk\nout of the senate-house. \n\nEven as they had devised these \n\nmatters, so were they executed: and Caesar was slain in the \n\n\n                   of the Senate. Antonius being put in a fear withal, cast a\nslave's gown upon him, and hid himself. But afterwards when\nit was told him that the \n\n                   slew no man else, and that\nthey went only into the Capitol, he sent his son unto them for a\npledge, and bade them boldly come down upon his word. The\nselfsame day he did bid Cassius to supper, and Lepidus also\nbade Brutus. The next morning the senate was assembled, and \nAntonius himself \n\n                   a law, that all things past should\nbe forgotten, and that they should appoint provinces unto \nCassius and Brutus: the which the senate confirmed, and further\nordained, that they should cancel none of Caesar's laws. Thus\nwent Antonius out of the senate more praised and better \nesteemed than ever man was, because it seemed to every man\nthat he had cut off all occasion of civil wars, and that he had\nshewed himself a marvelous wise governor of the common\nwealth, for the appeasing of these matters of so great weight\nand importance. But not the opinion he conceived of himself\nafter he had a little felt the good-will of the people towards\nhim, hoping thereby to make himself the chiefest man if he\nmight overcome Brutus, did easily make him alter his first\nmind. And therefore, when Caesar's body was brought to the\nplace where it should be-buried, he made a funeral oration in\ncommendation of Caesar, according to the ancient custom of\npraising noble men at their funerals. When he saw that the\npeople were very glad and desirous also to hear Caesar spoken\nof, and his praises uttered, he mingled his oration with lament\nable words ; and by amplifying of matters did greatly move their\nhearts and affections unto pity and compassion. In \n\n                  , to\nconclude his oration, he unfolded before the whole assembly\nthe bloody garments of the dead, thrust through in many places\nwith their swords, and called the malefactors cruel and cursed\nmurtherers. With these words he put the people into such a\nfury, that they \n\n                  took Caesar's body, and burnt it in the\nmarket-place, with such tables and forms as they could get \ntogether. Then when the fire was kindled, they took firebrands,\nand ran to the murtherers' houses to set them on fire, and to\nmake them come out to fight. \n\nBrutus therefore and his \naccomplices, for safety of their persons, were driven to fly the city.\nThen came all Caesar's friends unto Antonius, and specially his\nwife Calpurnia, putting their trust in him, she brought the most\npart of her money into his house, which amounted to the sum\n\n\nof 4000 talents; and furthermore brought him all Caesar's books\nand writings, in the which were his memorials of all that he had\ndone and ordained. Antonius did daily mingle with them such\nas he thought good, and by that means he created new officers,\nmade new senators, called home some that were banished, and\ndelivered those that were prisoners: and then he said, that all\nthose things were so appointed and ordained by Caesar. There\nfore the Romans, mocking them that were so moved, they called\nthem Charonites, because that, when they were overcome' \nthey\nhad no other help but to say, that thus they were found in\nCaesar's memorials, who had sailed in Charon's boat, and was\ndeparted. Thus Antonius ruled absolutely also in all other\nmatters, because he was Consul, and >Caius, one of his brethren'\nPraetor, and Lucius the other, Tribune.\n\n\n\n\n                   Now things remaining in this state at Rome, Octavius\nCaesar the younger came to Rome, who was the son of Julius\nCaesar's niece, as you have heard before, and was left his lawful\nheir by will, remaining, at the time of the death of his great\nuncle that was slain, in the city of Apollonia This young man\nat his first arrival went to salute Antonius, as one of his late\ndead father Caesar's friends, who by his last will and testament\nhad made him his heir; and withal, he was presently in hand\nwith him for money and other things which were left of trust in\nhis hands; because Caesar had by will bequeathed unto the \npeople of Rome threescore and fifteen silver drachmas to be given to\nevery man, the which he as heir stood- charged withal. \nAntonius at the first made no reckoning of him, because he was very\nyoung, and said, he lacked wit and good friends to advise him,\nif he looked to take such a charge in hand, as to undertake to\nbe Caesar's heir. But when Antonius saw that he could not\nshake him off with those words, and that he was \n\n                  \nwith him for his father's goods, but specially for the ready\nmoney, then he spake and did what he could against him. And\nfirst of all, it was he that did keep him from being Tribune of\nthe people: and also, when Octavius Caesar began to meddle\nwith the dedicating of the chair of gold, which was prepared by\nthe senate to honour Caesar with, he threatened to send him to\nprison, and moreover desisted not to put the people in an up\nroar. \n\nThis young Caesar, seeing his doings, went unto Cicero\nand others, which were Antonius' enemies, and by them crept\ninto favour with the senate: and he himself sought the people's\ngood will every manner of way, gathering together the old \n\nsoldiers of the late deceased Caesar, which were dispersed in divers\ncities and colonies. Antonius, being afraid of it, talked with\nOctavius in the Capitol, and became his friend. But the very\nsame night Antonius had a strange dream, who thought that\nlightning fell upon him, and burnt his right hand. Shortly after\nword was brought him, that Caesar lay in wait to kill him. \nCaesar cleared himself unto him, and told him there was no such\nmatter: but he could not make Antonius believe to the contrary.\nWhereupon they became further enemies than ever they were:\ninsomuch that both of them made friends of either side to gather\ntogether all the old soldiers through Italy, that were dispersed in\ndivers towns: and made them large promises, and sought also\nto win the legions on their side, which were already in arms.\n\n\nCicero on the other side, being at that time the chiefest man of\nauthority and estimation in the city, he stirred up all men\nagainst Antonius: so that in the end he made the senate \npronounce him an enemy to his country, and appointed young \nCaesar sergeants to carry axes before him, and such other signs as\nwere incident to the dignity of a Consul or Praetor: and more\nover, sent Hircius and Pansa, then Consuls, to drive Antonius\nout of Italy. These two Consuls, together with Caesar, who also\nhad an army, went against Antonius that besieged the city of\nModena, and there overthrew him in battle: but both the \nConsuls were slain there.\n\n \n                  Antonius, flying upon this overthrow, fell into great \nmisery all at once: but the chiefest want of all other, and that\npinched him most, was famine. Howbeit he was of such a\nstrong nature, that by patience he would overcome any \nadversity: and the heavier fortune lay upon him, the more constant\nshewed he himself. Every man that feeleth want or adversity,\nknoweth by virtue and discretion what he should do: but when\nindeed they are overlaid with extremity, and be sore oppressed,\nfew have the hearts to follow that which they praise and \ncommend, and much less to avoid that they reprove and \n\n                  :\nbut rather to the contrary, they yield to their accustomed easy\nlife, and through faint heart, and lack of courage, do change\ntheir first mind and purpose. And therefore it was a wonderful\nexample to the soldiers, to see Antonius, that was brought up in\nall fineness and superfluity, so easily to drink puddle water, and\nto eat wild fruits and roots: and moreover it is reported, that\neven as they passed the Alps, they did eat the barks of trees, \nand such beasts as never man tasted of their flesh before. \n\n\n                  Now\n\ntheir intent was to join with the legions that were on the other\nside of the mountains, under Lepidus, charge: whom Antonius\ntook to be his friend, because he had holpen him to many\nthings at Caesar's hand, through his means. When he was come\nto the place where Lepidus was, he camped hard by him: and\nwhen he saw that no man came to him to put him in any hope,\nhe determined to \n\n                   himself, and to go unto Lepidus.\nSince the overthrow he had at Modena, he suffered his beard to\ngrow at length and never clips it, that it was marvellous long,\nand the hair of his head also without combing: and besides all\nthis, he went in a mourning gown, and after this sort came\n\n\n                  to the trenches of Lepidus' camp. Then he began to\nspeak unto the soldiers, and many of them their hearts yearned\nfor pity to see him so poorly arrayed, and some also, through his\nwords, began to pity him: insomuch that Lepidus began to be\nafraid, and therefore commanded all the trumpets to sound \ntogether to stop the soldiers' ears, that they should not hearken\nto Antonius. This notwithstanding, the soldiers took the more\npity of him, and spake secretly with him by Clodius' and Laelius'\nmeans, whom they sent unto him disguised in women's apparel,\nand gave him counsel that he should not be afraid to enter into\ntheir camp, for there were a great number of soldiers that would\nreceive him, and kill Lepidus, if he would say the word. \nAntonius would not suffer them to hurt him, but the next morning\nhe went with his army to wade a ford, at a little river that ran\nbetween them: and himself was the foremost man that \n\n                   the\nriver to get over, seeing a number of Lepidus, camp, that gave\nhim their hands, plucked up the stakes, and laid flat the bank\nof their trench to let him into their camp. When he was come\ninto their camp, and that he had all the army at his \ncommandment, he used Lepidus very courteously, embraced him, and\ncalled him father: and though indeed Antonius did all, and\nruled the whole army, yet he alway gave Lepidus the name and\nhonour of the captain. Munacius Plancus, lying also in camp\nhard by with an army, understanding the report of Antonius'\ncourtesy, he also came and joined with him.\n\n Thus Antonius being afoot again, and grown of great\npower, repassed over the Alps, leading into Italy with him\nseventeen legions, and ten thousand horsemen, besides six \nlegions he left in garrison among the Gauls, under the charge\nof one Varius, a companion of his that would drink lustily with\n\nhim, and therefore in mockery was surnamed Cotylon, \n\n                  , \n\na \n                  . \n\nSo Octavius Caesar would not lean to Cicero, when\nhe saw that his whole \n\n                   and endeavour was only to re\nstore the commonwealth to her former liberty. Therefore he\nsent certain of his friends to Antonius, to make them friends\nagain: and thereupon all three met together (\n\n                  , Caesar,\nAntonius, and Lepidus) in an \n\n                   environed round about\nwith a little river, and there remained three days together. Now\nas touching all other matters they were easily agreed, and did\ndivide all the empire of Rome between them, as if it had been\ntheir own inheritance. But yet they could hardly agree whom\nthey would put to death: for every one of them \n\n                   kill their\nenemies, and save their kinsmen and friends. Yet at length,\ngiving place to their greedy desire to be revenged of their \nenemies, they spurned all reverence of blood and holiness of friend\nship at their feet. For Caesar left Cicero to Antonius, will, \nAntonius also forsook Lucius Caesar, who was his uncle by his\nmother: and both of them together suffered Lepidus to kill his\nown brother Paulus. Yet some writers affirm, that Caesar and\nAntonius requested Paulus might be slain, and that Lepidus was\ncontented with it In my opinion there was never a more \nhorrible, unnatural, and crueller change than this was. For thus\n\n\n                   \n                  \n                   for murther, they did as well kill those whom\nthey did forsake and leave unto others, as those also which\nothers left unto them to kill: but so much more was their\nwickedness and cruelty great unto their friends, for that they put\nthem to death being innocents, and having no cause to hate\nthem. \n\nAfter this plot was agreed upon between them, the \nsoldiers that were thereabouts would have his friendship and\nleague betwixt them confirmed by marriage, and that Caesar\nshould marry Claudia, the daughter of Fulvia, Antonius, wife.\nThis marriage also being agreed upon, they condemned 300 of\nthe chiefest citizens of Rome to be put to death by proscription\nAnd Antonius also commanded them to whom he had given\ncommission to kill Cicero, that they should strike off his head\nand right hand, with the which he had written the invective\norations (called Philippides) against Antonius. So when the\nmurtherers brought him Cicero's head and hand cut off, he be\nheld them a long time with great joy, and laughed heartily, and\nthat oftentimes, for the great joy he felt. Then when he had\ntaken his pleasure of the sight of them, he caused them to be\nset up in an open place, over the pulpit for orations (where,\nwhen he was alive, he had often spoken to the people), as if he\n\n\n had done the dead man hurt, and not blemished his own for\ntune, strewing himself (to his great shame and infamy) a cruel\nman, and unworthy the office and authority he bare. His uncle\nLucius Caesar also, as they sought for him to kill him and \nfollowed him hard, fled unto his sister. The murderers coming\nthither, forcing to break into her chamber, she stood at her\nchamber-door with her arms abroad, crying out still: \"You\nshall not kill Lucius Caesar, before you first kill me, that bare\nyour captain in my womb.\" By this means she saved her \nbrother's life. \n\n\n                  Now the government of these Triumviri grew odious\nand hateful to the Romans, for divers respects: but they most\nblamed Antonius, because he, being elder than Caesar, and of\nmore power and force than Lepidus, gave himself again to his\nformer riot and excess, when he \n\n                   to deal in the affairs of\nthe commonwealth. But setting aside the ill name he had for\nhis insolency, he was yet much more hated in respect of the\nhouse he dwelt in, the which was the house of Pompey the\ngreat, a man as famous for his temperance, modesty, and civil\nlife, as for his three triumphs. For it grieved them to see the\ngates commonly shut against the captains, magistrates of the\ncity, and also ambassadors of strange nations, which were\nsometimes thrust from the gate with violence: and that the\nhouse within was full of tumblers, antic dancers, jugglers, \nplayers, jesters, and drunkards, quaffing and guzzling; and that on\nthem he bestowed the most part of his money he got by all\nkind of possible extortions, bribery, and \n\n                  . For they did\nnot only sell by the crier tile goods of those whom they had\noutlawed and appointed to murder, slanderously deceived the\npoor widows and young orphans, and also raised a]l kinds of\nimposts, subsidies, and taxes, but understanding also that the\nholy Vestal nuns had certain goods and money put in their\ncustody to keep1 both of men's in the city and those also that\nwere abroad, they went thither and took them away by force.\n\n Octavius Caesar perceiving that no money would serve\nAntonius' turn, he prayed that they might divide the money \nbetween them; and so did they also divide the army, for them\nboth to go into Macedon to make war against Brutus and \nCassius and in the mean time they left the government of the city\nof Rome unto Lepidus. \n\nWhen they had passed over the seas,\nand that they began to make war, they being both camped by\ntheir enemies, to wit, Antonius against Cassius, and Caesar\nagainst Brutus, Caesar did no great matter, but Antonius had\n\n\nalway the upper hand, and did all. For at the first battle Caesar\nwas overthrown by Brutus, and lost his camp, and very hardly\nsaved himself by flying from them that followed him. Howbeit,\nhe writeth himself in his Commentaries, that he fled before the\ncharge was given, because of a dream one of his friends had.\nAntonius on the other side overthrew Cassius in battle, though\nsome write that he was not there himself at the battle, but that\nhe came after the overthrow, whilst his men had the enemies in\nchase. So Cassius, at his earnest request, was slain by a faithful\nservant of his own called Pindarus, whom he had enfranchised:\nbecause he knew not in time that Brutus had overcome Caesar.\nShortly after they fought another battle again, in the which\nBrutus was overthrown, who afterwards also slew himself. Thus\nAntonius had the chiefest glory of this victory, specially because\nCaesar was sick at that time. Antonius having found Brutus,\nbody after this battle, blaming him much for the \n\n                   of\nhis brother Caius, whom he had put to death in Macedon for\nrevenge of Cicero's cruel death, and yet laying the fault more in\nHortensius than in him, he made Hortensius to be slain on his\nbrother's tomb Furthermore he cast his\n\n                   (which\nwas wonderful rich and sumptuous) upon Brutus, body, and\ngave commandment to one of his slaves enfranchised, to defray\nthe charge of his burial. But afterwards Antonius hearing that\nhis enfranchised bondman had not burnt his \n\n                   with\nhis body, because it was very rich and worth a great sum of\nmoney, and that he had also kept back much of the ready money\nappointed for his funeral and tomb, he also put him to death.\n\n\n                  After that, Caesar was conveyed to Rome, and it was\nthought he would not live long, nor escape the sickness he had.\nAntonius on the other side went towards the east provinces and\nregions to levy money: and first of all he went into Greece, and\ncarried an infinite number of soldiers with him. Now, because\nevery soldier was promised five thousand silver drachmas, he\nwas driven of necessity to impose extreme \n\n                   and taxations.\nAt his first coming into Greece, he was not hard nor bitter unto\nthe Grecians, but gave himself-only to hear wise men dispute, to\nsee plays, and also to note the ceremonies and sacrifices of\nGreece, ministering justice to every man: and it pleased him\nmarvellously to hear them call him Philellen (as much to say,\na lover of the Grecians), and specially the Athenians, to whom\nhe did many great pleasures. Wherefore the Megarians, to \nexceed the Athenians, thinking to shew Antonius a goodly sight,\n\n\n they prayed him to come and see their senate-house and council\nhall. Antonius went thither to see it. So when he had seen it\nat his pleasure, they asked him: \"My lord, how like you our\nhall?', \"Me thinks,\" quoth he, \"it is little, old, and reedy to fall\ndown.\" Furthermore he took measure of the temple of Apollo\nPythias, and promised the senate to finish it. \n\nBut when he was\nonce come into Asia, having left Lucius Censorinus governor in\nGreece, and that he had \n\n                   the riches and pleasures of the east\nparts, and that princes, great lords, and kings, came to wait at\nhis gate for his coming out: and that queens and princesses, to\nexcel one another, gave him very rich presents, and came to see\nhim, curiously setting forth themselves, and using all art that\nmight be to shew their beauty, to win his favour the more\n(Caesar in the mean space \n\n                   his wits and body in civil\nWars at home, Antonius living merrily and quietly abroad), he\neasily fell again to his old licentious life. For straight, one\nAnaxenor, a player of the \n\n                  , Xoutus, a player of the flute,\nMetrodorus a tumbler, and such a rabble of minstrels and fit\nministers for the pleasures of Asia (who in fineness and flattery\npassed all the other plagues he brought with him out of Italy),\nall these flocked in his court, and bare the whole sway: and after\nthat all went awry. For every one gave themselves to riot and\nexcess, when they saw he delighted in it: and all Asia was like\nto the city Sophocles speaketh of in one of his tragedies:\n\n\n\nFor in the city of Ephesus, women, attired as they go in the feasts\nand sacrifice of Bacchus, came out to meet him with such \nsolemnities and ceremonies as are then used: with men and children\ndisguised like fauns and satyrs. Moreover, the city was full\nof ivy, and darts wreathed about with ivy, \n\n                  , flutes,\nand \n\n                  ; and in their songs they called him Bacchus,\nfather of mirth, courteous and gentle: and so was he unto some,\nbut to the most part of men cruel and extreme. For he robbed\nnoblemen and gentlemen of their goods, to give it unto vile\nflatterers: who oftentimes begged living men's goods, as though\nthey had been dead, and would enter their houses by force. As\nhe gave a citizen's house of Magnesia unto a cook, because (as\nit is reported) he dressed him a fine supper. In the end he\ndoubled the taxation, and imposed a second upon Asia. But\nthen Hybraeas the orator, sent from the estates of Asia, to tell\nhim the state of their country, boldly said unto him: \"If thou\n\n\nwilt have power to lay two tributes in one year upon us, thou\nshouldest also have power to give us two summers, two autumns,\nand two harvests.\" This was gallantly and pleasantly spoken\nunto Antonius by the orator, and it pleased him well to hear it:\nbut afterwards, amplifying his speech, he spake more boldly, and\nto better purpose: \"Asia hath paid thee two hundred thousand\ntalents. If all this money be not come to thy coffers, then ask\naccount of them that levied it: but if thou have received it, and\nnothing be left of it, then are we utterly undone.\" Hybraeas'\nwords nettled Antonius \n\n                  . For he understood not of the\nthefts and robberies his officers committed by his authority, in\nhis treasure and affairs: not so much because he was careless\nas for that he over simply trusted his men in all things. For he\nwas a plain man, without subtilty, and therefore over late found\nout the foul faults they committed against him: but when he\nheard of them, he was much offended, and would plainly confess\nit unto them whom his officers had done injury unto by \ncountenance of his authority. He had a noble mind, as well to punish\noffenders as to reward well-doers: and yet he did exceed more\nin giving than in punishing. Now \n\n                   his outrageous manner\nof railing he commonly used, mocking and \n\n                   of every\nman, that was remedied by itself; for a man might as boldly ex\nchange a mock with him, and he was as well contented to be\nmocked as to mock others: but yet it oftentimes marred all\nFor he thought that those which told him so plainly and truly\nin mirth, would never flatter him in good earnest in any matters\nof weight. But thus he was easily \n\n                   by the praises they\ngave him, not finding how these flatterers mingled their flattery\nunder this familiar and plain manner of speech unto him, as a\nfine device to make difference of meats with sharp and tart sauce\n\nand also to keep him by this \n\n                   jesting and \n\n                   with\nhim at the table, that their common flattery should not be\ntroublesome unto him, as men do easily \n\n                   to have too \nmuch\nof one thing: and that they handled him finely thereby, when\nthey would give him place in any matter of weight and follow\nhis counsel, that it might not appear to him they did it so much\nto please him, but because they were ignorant, and understood\nnot so much as he did.\n\n\n                   Antonius being thus inclined, the last and extremest\nmischief of all other (to wit, the love of Cleopatra) lighted on \nhim,\nwho did waken and stir up many vices yet hidden in him, and\nwere never seen to any: and if any spark of goodness or hope of\n\n rising were left him, Cleopatra quenched it straight, and made\nit worse than before. The manner how he fell in love with her\nwas this. Antonius, going to make war with the Parthians, sent\nto command Cleopatra to appear personally before him when he\ncame into Cilicia, to answer unto such accusations as were laid\nagainst her, being this: that she had aided Cassius and Brutus\nin their war against him. The messenger sent unto Cleopatra,\nto make this summons unto her, was called Dellius; who when\nhe had throughly \n\n                   her beauty, the excellent grace\nand sweetness of her tongue, he nothing \n\n                   that \nAntonius would do any hurt to so noble a lady, but rather \nassured\nhimself, that within few days she should be in great favour with\nhim. Thereupon he did her great honour, and persuaded her to\ncome into Cilicia, as honourably \n\n                   as she could \npossible; and bad her not to be afraid at all of Antonius, for he was\na more courteous lord than any that she had ever seen. \nCleopatra on the other side, believing Dellius' words, and guessing\nby the former access and credit she had with Julius Caesar and\nC. Pompey (the son of Pompey the Great) only for her beauty,\nshe began to have good hope that she might more easily win\nAntonius. For Caesar and Pompey knew her when she was but\na young thing, and knew not then what the world meant: but\nnow she went to Antonius at the age when a woman's beauty is\nat the prime, and she also of best judgment. So she \n\n                  \nherself with a world of gifts, store of gold and silver, and of\nriches and other sumptuous ornaments, as is credible enough\nshe might bring from so great a house, and from so wealthy\nand rich a realm as Egypt was. But yet she carried nothing\nwith her wherein she trusted more than in herself, and in the\ncharms and enchantment of her \n                   beauty and grace.\n\n\n                  Therefore, when she was sent unto by divers letters, both from\nAntonius himself and also from his friends, she made so light\nof it, and mocked Antonius so much, that she disdained to set\nforward otherwise, but to take her barge in the river of Cydnus;\nthe poop whereof was of gold, the sails of purple, and the oars\nof silver, which kept stroke in rowing after the sound of the\nmusic of flutes, \n\n                  , \n\n                  , viols, and such other \ninstruments as they played upon in the barge. And now for the\nperson of her self, she was laid under a pavilion of cloth of\ngold of tissue, apparelled and attired like the goddess Venus,\ncommonly drawn in picture: and hard by her, on either hand of\nher, pretty fair boys apparelled as painters do set forth god\n\n\nCupid, with little fans in their hands, with the which they fanned\nwind upon her. Her ladies and gentlewomen also, the fairest of\nthem, were apparelled like the nymphs mermaids (which are the\nmermaids of the waters) and like the Graces , some steering the\nhelm, others tending the tackle and ropes of the barge, out of\nthe which there came a wonderful \n\n                   sweet savour of per\nfumes, that perfumed the wharf's side, \n\n                   with \ninnumerable multitudes of people. Some of them followed the barge all\nalong the river-side: others also ran out of the city to see her\ncoming in. So that in the end, there ran such multitudes of\npeople one after another to see her, that Antonius was left \n\n                  \nalone in the market-place, in his imperial seat, to give audience:\nand there went a rumour in the people's mouths, that the goddess\nVenus was come to play with the god Bacchus, for the general\ngood of all Asia. When Cleopatra landed, Antonius sent to \ninvite her to supper to him. But she sent him word again, he\nshould do better rather to come and sup with her. Antonius\ntherefore, to shew himself courteous unto her at her arrival, was\ncontented to obey her, and went to supper to her: where he\nfound such \n\n                   sumptuous fare, that no tongue can express\nit. But amongst all other things, he most wondered at the \ninfinite number of lights and torches \n\n                   on the top of the\nhouse, giving light in every place, so artificially set and ordered\nby devices, some round, some square: that it was the rarest\nthing to behold that eye could discern, or that ever books could\nmention. \n\nThe next night Antonius, feasting her, contended to\n\n\n                   her in magnificence and fineness: but she overcame him:\nin both. So that he himself began to scorn the gross service of\nhis house, in respect of Cleopatra's sumptuousness and fineness. \nAnd when Cleopatra found Antonius' jests and \n\n                   to be but\n\n\n                   and soldier-like, in plain manner, \n                  , him finely, \nand without fear taunted him \n\n                  . Now her beauty (as,\nit is reported) was not so passing as unmatchable of other \nwomen, nor yet such as upon present view did enamour men \nwith her: but so sweet was her company and conversation, that\na man could not possibly but be taken. And besides her beauty,\nthe good grace she had to talk and discourse, her courteous nature\nthat tempered her words and deeds, was a spur that pricked to \nthe quick Furthermore, besides all these, her voice and words \nwere marvellous pleasant: for her tongue was an instrument of \nmusic to divers sports and pastimes, the which she easily turned \ninto any language that pleased her. She spake unto few \n\nbarbarous people by interpreter, but made them answer her self, or at\nthe least the most part of them: as the Aethiopians, the Arabians,\nthe Troglodytes, the Hebrews, the Syrians, the Medes, and the\nParthians, and to many others also, whose languages she had\nlearned. Whereas divers of her progenitors, the kings of Egypt,\ncould scarce learn the Egyptian tongue only, and many of them\nforgot to speak the Macedonian.\n\n\n                   Now Antonius was so ravished with the love of \nCleopatra, that though his wife Fulvia had great wars, and much ado\nwith Caesar for his affairs, and that the army of the Parthians\n(the which the king's lieutenants had given to the \n\n                   leading\nof Labienus) was now assembled in Mesopotamia, ready to \ninvade Syria; yet (as though all this had nothing touched him) he\nyielded himself to go with Cleopatra unto Alexandria, where he\nspent and lost in childish sports (as a man might say) and idle\npastimes, the most precious thing a man can spend (as Antiphon\nsaith), and that is, time. For they made an order between them,\nwhich they called  (as much to say, no life \ncomparable and matchable with it), one feasting each other by turns,\nand in cost exceeding all measure and reason. And for proof\nhereof, I have heard my grandfather Lampryas report, that one\nPhilotas, a physician, born in the city of Amphissa, told him\nthat he was at that present time in Alexandria, and studied\nphysic; and that having acquaintance with one of Antonius,\ncooks, he took him with him to Antonius, house (being a young\nman desirous to see things), to shew him the wonderful \nsumptuous charge and preparation of one only supper. When he was\nin the kitchen, and saw a world of diversities of meats, and\namongst others eight wild boars roasted whole, he began to \nwonder at it, and said: \" Sure you have a great number of guests to\nsupper.\" The cook fell a-laughing, and answered him: \"No,\"\nquoth he, \"not many guests, nor above twelve in all: but yet all\nthat is boiled or roasted must be served in whole, or else it would\nbe marred straight: for Antonius peradventure will sup presently,\nor it may be a pretty while hence, or likely enough he will defer\nit longer, for that he hath drunk well today, or else hath had\nsome other great matters in hand: and therefore we do not dress\none supper only, but many suppers, because we are uncertain of\nthe hour he will sup in.\"  Philotas the physician told my grand\nfather this tale, and said moreover, that it was his chance shortly\nafter to serve the eldest son of the said Antonius, whom he had\nby his wife Fulvia; and that he sat commonly at his table with\n\n\nhis other friends, when he did not dine nor sup with his father. \nIt chanced one day there came a physician that was so full\nof words, that he made every man weary of him at the board:\nbut Philotas, to stop his mouth, put out this subtle proposition\nto him: \" It is good in some sort to let a man drink cold water\nthat hath an ague: but every man that hath an ague, hath it in\nsome sort: ergo, it is good for every man that hath an ague to\ndrink cold water.\" The physician was so \n\n                   and \n\n                  \nwithal, that he had not a word more to say. Young Antonius\nburst out into such a laughing at him, and was so glad of it, that\nhe said unto him: \" Philotas, take all that, I give it thee :\"\nstrewing him his cupboard full of plate, with great pots of gold\nand silver. Philotas thanked him, and told him he thought\nhimself greatly bound to him for this liberality, but he would\nnever have thought that he had had power to have given so\nmany things, and of so great value. But much more he marvel\nled, when shortly after one of young Antonius' men brought\nhim home all the pots in a basket, bidding him set his mark \nand\nstamp upon them, and to lock them up. Philotas returned the\nbringer of them, fearing to be reproved if he took them. Then\nthe young gentleman Antonius said unto him: \"Alas, poor man,\nwhy doest thou make it \n\n                   to take them? knowest thou not\nthat it is the son of Antonius that gives them thee, and is able\nto do it? if thou wilt not believe me, take rather the ready money\nthey come to: because my father peradventure may ask for some\nof the plate, for the \n\n                   and excellent workmanship of them.\"\nThis I have heard my grandfather tell oftentimes.\n\n\n                   \n                  But now again to Cleopatra. Plato writeth that there\nare four kinds of flattery: but Cleopatra divided it into many \nkinds. For she (were it in sport, or in matters of earnest) still\n\ndevised sundry new delights to have Antonius at commandment, \nnever leaving him night nor day, nor once letting him go out\n\nof her sight. For she would play at dice with him, drink with \nhim, and hunt commonly with him, and also be with him\nwhen he went to any exercise or activity of body. And some\ntime also, when he would go up and down the city disguised\nlike a slave in the night, and would peer into poor men's \nwindows and their shops, and scold and brawl with them within\nthe house, Cleopatra would be also in a chamber-maid's array,\nand amble up and down the streets with him, so that often\ntimes Antonius bare away both mocks and blows. Now though\nmost men \n\n                   this manner, yet the Alexandrians were\n\n\n commonly glad of this jollity, and liked it well, saying very\ngallantly and wisely: 'that Antonius shewed them a comical\nface, to wit, a merry countenance: and the Romans a tragical\nface, to say, a grim look., But to reckon up all the foolish\nsports they made, revelling in this sort, it were too \n\n                   a\npart of me, and therefore I will only tell you one among the\nrest. On a time he went to angle for fish, and when he could\ntake none, he was as angry as could be, because Cleopatra\nstood by. Wherefore he secretly commanded the fishermen,\nthat when he cast in his line, they should straight dive under\nthe water, and put a fish on his hook which they had taken be\nfore: and so snatched up his angling-rod, and brought up a fish\ntwice or thrice. Cleopatra \n\n                   it straight, yet she seemed\nnot to see it, but wondered at his excellent fishing: but when\nshe was alone by herself among her own people, she told them\nhow it was, and bad them the next morning to be on the water\nto see the fishing. A number of people came to the haven,\nand got into the fisher-boats to see this fishing. Antonius\nthen threw in his line, and Cleopatra straight commanded one\nof her men to dive under water before Antonius' men, and to\nput some old salt-fish upon his bait, like unto those that are\nbrought out of the country of Pont. When he had hung the\nfish on his hook, Antonius, thinking he had taken a fish in\ndeed, snatched up his dine \n\n                  . Then they all fell a\nlaughing. Cleopatra laughing also, said unto him: \"Leave us,\nmy lord, Egyptians (which dwell in the country of Pharus and\nCanobus) your angling-rod: this is not thy profession, thou\nmust hunt after conquering of realms and countries.\"\n\n\n                  \n                  Now Antonius delighting in these fond and childish\npastimes, very ill news were brought him from two places.\nThe first from Rome, that his brother Lucius and Fulvia his\nwife fell out first between themselves, and afterwards \nfell to\nopen war with Caesar, and had brought all to nought, that they\nwere both driven to fly out of Italy. The second news, as\nbad as the first: that Labienus conquered all Asia with the\narmy of the Parthians, from the river of Euphrates and from\nSyria unto the country of Lydia and Ionia. Then began\nAntonius with much ado a little to rouse himself, as if he\nhad been wakened out of a deep sleep, and, as a man may\nsay, coming out of a great drunkenness. So, first of all he\nbent himself against the Parthians, and went as far as the\ncountry of Phoenicia: but there he received lamentable letters\n\n\nfrom his wife Fulvia Whereupon he straight returned towards\nItaly, with two hundred sail: and as he went, took up his\nfriends by the way that fled out of Italy to come to him. By\nthem he was informed, that his wife Fulvia was the only cause\nof this war: who being of a peevish, crooked, and troublesome\nnature, had purposely raised this uproar in Italy, in hope there\nby to withdraw him from Cleopatra.  But by good fortune his\nwife Fulvia, going to meet with Antonius, sickened by the way,\nand died in the city of Sicyon: and therefore Octavius Caesar\nand he were the \n\n                   made friends again. For when \nAntonius landed in Italy, and that men saw Caesar asked nothing\nof him, and that Antonius on the other side laid all the fault\nand burden on his wife Fulvia; the friends of both parties\nwould not suffer them to unrip any old matters, and to prove\nor defend who had the wrong or right, and who was the first\n\n\n                   of this war, fearing to make matters worse between\nthem: but they made them friends together, and divided the\nempire of Rome between them, making the sea Ionium the\nbounds of their division. For they gave all the provinces east\nward unto Antonius, all the countries westward unto Caesar,\nand left  Africa unto Lepidus: and made a law, that they three,\none after another, should make their friends Consuls, when they\nwould not be themselves. This seemed to be a sound counsel,\nbut yet it was to be confirmed with a \n\n                   bond, which\nfortune offered thus. \n\n\n                  There was Octavia, the eldest sister of\nCaesar, not by one rather, for she came of Ancharia, and\nCaesar himself afterwards of Accia. It is reported, that he\ndearly loved his sister Octavia, for indeed she was a noble lady,\nand left the widow of her first husband Caius Marcellus, who\ndied not long before: and it seemed also that Antonius had\nbeen widower ever since the death of his wife Fulvia. For he\ndenied not that he kept Cleopatra, neither did he confess that\nhe had her as his wife: and so with reason he did defend the\nlove he bare unto this Egyptian Cleopatra. Thereupon every\nman did set forward this marriage, hoping thereby that this lady\nOctavia, having an excellent grace, wisdom, and honesty, joined\nunto so rare a beauty, when she were with Antonius (he \nloving her as so worthy a lady deserveth) she should be a good\n\n\n                   to keep good love and amity betwixt her brother and\nhim. So when Caesar and he had made the match between\nthem, they both went to Rome about this marriage, although\nit was against the law that a widow should be married within\n\n\nten months after her husband's death. Howbeit the senate\ndispensed with the law, and so the marriage proceeded accordingly.\n\n\n                  Sextus Pompeius at that time kept in Sicilia, and so\nmade many an inroad into Italy with a great number of \npinnaces and other pirates' strips, of the which were captains two\nnotable pirates, Menas and Menecrates, who so scoured all the\nsea thereabouts, that none durst peep out with a sail. Further\nmore, Sextus Pompeius had dealt very friendly with Antonius,\nfor he had courteously received his mother when she fled out\nof Italy with Fulvia, and therefore they thought good to make\npeace with him. So they met all three together by the mount\nof Misena, upon a hill that runneth far into the sea: Pompey\nhaving his ships riding hard by at anchor, and Antonius and\nCaesar their armies upon the shore-side, directly over against\nhim. Now, after they had agreed that Sextus Pompeius should\nhave Sicily and Sardinia, with this condition, that he should\nrid the sea of all thieves and pirates, and make it safe for\npassengers, and withal, that he should send a \n\n                   of\nwheat to Rome, one of them did feast another, and drew \n\n                  \nwho should begin. It was Pompeius chance to invite them\nfirst. Whereupon Antonius asked him: \"And where shall we\nsup?\" \"There,\" said Pompey; and shewed him his admiral\ngalley which had six banks of oars: \"that,\" said he, \"is my\nfather's house they have left me.\" He spake it to taunt \nAntonius, because he had his father's house, that was Pompey the\nGreat. So he cast anchors \n\n                   into the sea, to make his galley\nfast, and then built a bridge of wood to convey them to his\ngalley, from the head of mount Misena: and there he welcomed\nthem, and made them great cheer. Now in the midst of the\nfeast, when they fell to be merry with Antonius, love unto \nCleopatra, Menas the pirate came to Pompey, and whispering in his\near, said unto him: \" Shall I cut the cables of the anchors, and\nmake thee lord not only of Sicily and Sardinia, but of the whole\nempire of Rome besides?\" Pompey, having paused a while upon\nit, at length answered him: \"Thou shouldest have done it, and\nnever have told it me; but now we must content us with that\nwe have: as for myself, I was never taught to break my faith,\nnor to be counted a traitor.\" The other two also did likewise\nfeast him in their camp, and then he returned into Sicily.\n\n\n                  Antonius, after this agreement made, sent Ventidius be\nfore into Asia to stay the Parthians, and to keep \nthem they\n\n\nshould come no further: and he himself in the mean time, to\ngratify Caesar, was contented to be chosen Julius Caesar's priest\nand sacrificer, and so they jointly together dispatched all great\nmatters concerning the state of the empire. But in all other\nmanner of sports and exercises, wherein they passed the time\naway the one with the other, Antonius was ever inferior unto\nCaesar, and alway lost, which grieved him much. With Antonius\nthere was a soothsayer or astronomer of Egypt, that could cast\na figure, and judge of men's nativities, to tell them what should\nhappen to them. He, either to please Cleopatra, or else for that\nhe found it so by his art, told Antonius plainly, that his fortune\n(which of itself was excellent good, and very great) was \naltogether blemished and obscured by Caesar's fortune: and there\nfore he counselled him utterly to leave his company, and to get\nhim as far from him as he could. \"For thy demon,\" said he\n(that is to say, the good angel and spirit that keepeth thee) \"is\nafraid of his: and being courageous and high when he is alone,\nbecometh fearful and timorous when he cometh near unto the\nother.\" Howsoever it was, the events ensuing proved the \nEgyptian's words true: for it is said, that as often as they two drew\n\n\n                   for pastime, who should have anything, or whether they\nplayed at dice, Antonius alway lost. Oftentimes when they were\ndisposed to see cock-fight, or quails that were taught to fight one\nwith another, Caesar's cocks or quails did ever overcome. The\nwhich spited Antonius in his mind, although he made no out\nward shew of it: and therefore he believed the Egyptian the\nbetter. In \n\n                  , he \n\n                   the affairs of his house unto\nCaesar, and went out of Italy with Octavia his wife, whom he\ncarried into Greece after he had had a daughter by her.\n\n \n                  So Antonius lying all the winter at Athens, news came\nunto him of the victories of Ventidius, who had overcome the\nParthians in battle, in the which also were slain Labienus and\nPharnabates, the chiefest captains king Orodes had. For these\ngood news he feasted all Athens, and kept open house for all the\nGrecians, and many games of price were played at Athens, of\nthe which he himself would be judge. Wherefore leaving his\nguard, his axes, and tokens of his empire at his house, he came\ninto the shew-place or lists (where these games were played) in\na long gown and slippers after the Grecian fashion, and they\ncarried \n\n                   before him, as marshals' men do carry before\nthe judges, to make place: and he himself in person was a\n\n\n                   to part the young men, when they had fought enough.\n\n\n                  After that, preparing to go to the wars, he made him a garland\nof the holy olive, and carried a vessel with him of the water of\nthe fountain Clepsydra, because of an oracle he had received,\nthat so commanded him. In the meantime, Ventidius once\nagain overcame Pacorus (Orodes, son, king of Parthia) in a battle\nfought in the country of Cyrrestica, he being come again with\na great army to invade Syria: at which battle was slain a great\nnumber of the Parthians, and among them Pacorus, the king's\nown son. This noble exploit, as famous as ever any was, was a\nfull revenge ta the Romans of the shame and loss they had \nreceived before by the death of Marcus Crassus: and he made the\nParthians fly, and glad to keep themselves within the confines\nand territories of Mesopotamia and Media, after they had thrice\ntogether been overcome in several battles. Howbeit Ventidius\ndurst not undertake to follow them any farther, fearing lest he\nshould have gotten Antonius' displeasure by it. \nNotwithstanding, he led his army against them that had rebelled, and \nconquered them again: amongst whom he besieged Antiochus king\nof Commagena, who offered him to give a thousand talents to\nbe pardoned his rebellion, and promised ever after to be at\nAntonius' commandment. But Ventidius made him answer,\nthat he should send unto Antonius; who was not far off, and\nwould not suffer Ventidius to make any peace with Antiochus,\nto the end that yet this little exploit should pass in his name,\nand that they should not think he did anything but by his lieu\ntenant Ventidius. The siege grew very long, because they that\nwere in the town, seeing they could not be received upon no\nreasonable composition, determined valiantly to defend them\nselves to the last man. Thus Antonius did nothing, and yet\nreceived great shame, repenting him much that he took not\ntheir first offer. And yet at the last he was glad to make truce\nwith Antiochus, and to take three hundred talents for \ncomposition. Thus after he had set order for the state and affairs of\nSyria, he returned again to Athens: and having given Ventidius\nsuch honours as he deserved, he sent him to Rome, to triumph\nfor the Parthians. Ventidius was the only man that ever\ntriumphed of the Parthians until this present day, a mean man\nborn, and of no noble house or family: who only came to that\nhe attained unto, through Antonius' friendship, the which \ndelivered him happy occasion to achieve great matters. And yet to\nsay truly, he did so well \n\n                   himself in all his enterprises, that\nhe confirmed that which was spoken of Antonius and Caesar, to\n\n\nwit, that they were alway more fortunate when they made war\nby their lieutenants than by themselves. For Sossius, one of\nAntonius' lieutenants in Syria, did notable good service: and\nCanidius, whom be had also left his lieutenant in the borders of \nArmenia, did conquer it all. So did he also overcome the kings \nof the Iberians and Albanians, and went on with his conquests\n\nunto mount Caucasus.  By these conquests the fame of Antonius' \npower increased more and more, and grew dreadful unto all the\n\nbarbarous nations.\n\n\n                   But Antonius, notwithstanding, grew to be marvellously\noffended with Caesar, upon certain reports that had been brought\nunto him, and so took sea to go towards Italy with three \nhundred sail. And because those of Brundusium would not receive\nhis army into their haven, he went farther unto Tarentum.\nThere his wife Octavia, that came out of Greece with him,\nbesought him to send her unto her brother, the which he did.\nOctavia at that time was great with child, and moreover had a\nsecond daughter by him, and yet she put herself in journey,\nand met with her brother Octavius Caesar by the way, who\nbrought his two chief friends, Maecenas and Agrippa, with him.\nShe took them aside, and with all the \n\n                   she could\npossible, intreated them they would not suffer her, that was\nthe happiest woman of the world, to become now the most\nwretched and unfortunates\" creature of all other. \" For now,\" \nsaid she, \"every man's eyes do gaze on me, that am the sister \nof one of the emperors, and wife of the other. And if the\nworst counsel take place (which the gods forbid) and that they\ngrow to wars: for yourselves, it is uncertain to which of them\ntwo the gods have assigned the victory or overthrow. But for\nme, on which side soever the victory fall, my state can be but \nmost miserable still.\" These words of Octavia so softened\nCaesar's heart, that he went quickly unto Tarentum. But it\nwas a noble sight for them that were present, to see so great an\narmy by land not to stir; and so many ships afloat in the road\nquietly and safe: and furthermore, the meeting and kindness\nof friends, lovingly embracing one another. First, Antonius\nfeasted Caesar, which he granted unto for his sister's sake.\nAfterwards they agreed together, that Caesar should give\nAntonius two legions to go against the Parthians, and that\nAntonius should let Caesar have an hundred galleys armed with\nbrazen spurs at the prows. Besides all this, Octavia obtained of\nher husband twenty brigantines for her brother, and of her\n\n brother, for her husband, a thousand armed men. After they\nad taken leave of each other, Caesar went immediately to make\nwar with Sextus Pompeius, to get Sicilia into his hands. Antonius\nalso, leaving his wife Octavia and little children begotten of\nher, with Caesar, and his other children which he had by Fulvia,\nwent directly into Asia.\n\n\n                   Then began this pestilent plague and mischief of \nCleopatra's love (which had slept a long time, and seemed to have\nbeen utterly forgotten, and that Antonius had given place to\nbetter counsel) again to kindle, and to be in force, so soon as\nAntonius came near unto Syria. And in the end, the horse\nof the mind, as Plato termeth it, that is so hard of rein (I\nmean the unreined lust of concupiscence) did put out of\nAntonius, head all honest and commendable thoughts ; for\n he sent Fonteius Capito to bring Cleopatra into Syria: unto\nwhom, to welcome her, he gave no trifling things: but unto\nthat she had already, he added the provinces of Phoenicia, those\nof the nethermost Syria, the \n\n                   of Cyprus, and a great part\nof Cilicia, and that country of Jewry where the true balm is'\nand that part of Arabia where the Nabathaeans do dwell, which\nstretcheth out toward the ocean. These great gifts much\n\n                   the Romans. But now, though Antonius did easily\ngive away great segniories, realms, and mighty nations unto\nsome private men, and that also he took from other kings\ntheir lawful realms (as from Antigonus, king of the Jews,\nwhom he openly beheaded, where never king before had \nsuffered like death): yet all this did not so much offend the Romans,\nas the unmeasurable honours which he did unto Cleopatra.\nBut yet he did much more aggravate their malice and ill-will\ntowards him, because that Cleopatra having brought him two\ntwins, a son and a daughter, he named his son Alexander, and\nhis daughter Cleopatra; and gave them, \n\n                   their surnames, the\nto the one, and the  to the other. This \nnotwithstanding, he that could fine]y \n\n                   his shameful deeds with\nfine words, said, 'that the greatness and magnificence of the\nempire of Rome appeared most, not where the Romans took,\nbut where they gave much: and nobility was multiplied amongst\nmen by the posterity of kings, when they deft of their seed in\ndivers places: and that by this means his first ancestor was\nbegotten of Hercules, who had not left the hope and \ncontinuance of his line and posterity in the womb of one only woman,\nfearing Solon's laws, or regarding the ordinances of men \n\n\ntouching the procreation of children: but that he gave it unto nature,\nand established the foundation of many noble races and families\nin divers places.' \n\n\n                  Now when Phraortes had slain his father\nOrodes, and possessed the kingdom, many gentlemen of Parthia\nforsook him, and fled from him. Amongst them was Moneses,\na nobleman, and of great authority among his countrymen, who\ncame unto Antonius that received him, and compared his for\ntune unto Themistocles, and his own riches and magnificence\nunto the kings of Persia. For he gave Moneses three cities,\nLarissa, Arethusa and Hierapolis, which was called before\nBombice. Howbeit the king of Parthia shortly after called\nhim home again, upon his faith and word. Antonius was glad\nto let him go, hoping thereby to steal upon Phraortes \n\n\n                  . For he sent unto him, and told him that they would\nremain good friends, and have peace together, so he would but\nonly redeliver the standards and ensigns of the Romans (which\nthe Parthians had won in the battle where M. Crassus was\nslain) and the men also that remained yet prisoners of this\noverthrow. In the meantime he sent Cleopatra back into\nEgypt, and took his way towards Arabia and Armenia, and\nthere took a general muster of all his army he had together,\nand of the kings his confederates that were come by his \ncommandment to aid him, being a marvellous number: of the which,\nthe chiefest was Artavasdes king of Armenia, who did furnish\nhim \nwith\n6000 horsemen, \nand 7000\nfootmen. There were also\nof the Romans about threescore thousand footmen, and of\nhorsemen (Spaniards and Gauls reckoned for Romans) to the\nnumber of IO,000, and of other nations thirty thousand men,\nreckoning together the horsemen and light-armed footmen. This\nso great and \n                   army (which made the Indians quake\nfor fear, dwelling about the country of the Bactrians, and all\nAsia also to tremble) served him to no purpose' and all for the\nlove he bare to Cleopatra. For the earnest great desire he\nhad, to lie all winter with her, made him begin this war out of\ndue time, and for haste to put all in hazard: being so ravished\nand enchanted with the sweet poison of her love, that he had\nno other thought but of her, and how he might quickly return\nagain, more than how he might overcome his enemies. \n\nFor\nfirst of all, where he should have wintered in Armenia to refresh\nhis men, wearied with the long journey they had made, having\ncome eight thousand furlongs, and then at the beginning of the\nspring to go and invade Media before the Parthians should stir\n\n\nout of their houses and garrisons: he could tarry no longer,\nbut led them forthwith unto the province of Atropatene, leaving\nArmenia on the left hand, and foraged all the country. \nFurthermore, making all the haste he could, he left behind him\nengines of battery which were carried with him in three hundred\ncarts (among the which also there was a ram fourscore feet\nlong), being things most necessary for him, and the which he\ncould not get again for money, if they were once lost or marred.\nFor the high provinces of Asia have no trees growing of such\nheight and length, neither strong nor straight enough to make\nsuch like engines of battery. This notwithstanding, he left them\nall behind him, as an hindrance to bring his matters and intent\nspeedily to pass: and left a certain number of men to keep them,\nand gave them in charge unto one Tatianus.\n\n \n                  Then he went to besiege the city of Phraata, being the\nchiefest and greatest city the king of Media had, where his\nwife and children were. Then he straight found out his own\nfault, and the want of his artillery he left behind him, by the\nwork he had in hand: for he was fain, for lack of a breach (where\nhis men might come to the sword with their enemies that\ndefended the wall, to force a mound of earth hard to the walls\nof the city, the which by little and little, with great labour, rose\nto some height. In the meantime king Phraortes came down\nwith a great army, who, understanding that Antonius had left\nhis engines of battery behind him, he sent a great number of\nhorsemen before, which environed Tatianus with all his \n\n\n                  , and slew him, and ten thousand men he had with him.\nAfter this the barbarous people took these engines of battery\nand burnt them, and got many prisoners, amongst whom they\ntook also king Polemon. \n\nThis discomfiture marvellously troubled\nall Antonius, army, to receive so great an overthrow (beyond\ntheir expectation) at the beginning of their journey: insomuch\nthat Artavastes, king of the Armenians, despairing of the good\nsuccess of the Romans, departed with his men, notwithstanding\nthat he was himself the first \n                  , of this war and journey.\nOn the other side, the Parthians came courageously unto \nAntonius, camp, who lay at the siege of their chiefest city, and\ncruelly reviled and threatened him. Antonius therefore, fearing\nthat if he lay still and did nothing, his men's hearts would fail\nthem, he took ten legions, with three cohorts or ensigns of the\nPraetors (which are companies appointed for the guard of the\ngeneral) and ail his horsemen, and carried them out to forage,\n\n\nhoping thereby he should easily allure the Parthians to fight a\nbattle. But when he had marched about a day's journey from\nhis camp, he saw the Parthians wheeling round about him to\ngive him the onset, and to skirmish with him, when he would\nthink to march his way. Therefore he set out his signal of\nbattle, and yet caused his tents and \n\n                   to be \n\n                   up,\nas though he meant not to fight, but only to lead his men\nback again Then he marched before the army of the barbarous\npeople, the which was marshalled like a \n\n                   or half moon,\nand commanded his horsemen that, as soon as they thought the\nlegions were near enough unto their enemies to sit upon the\n\n\n                  , that then they should set spurs to their horses, and begin\nthe charge. The Parthians standing in battle \n\n                  , beholding\nthe countenance of the Romans as they marched, \n                  . For in their march they kept their ranks a little space\none from another, not straggling out of order, and shaking\ntheir pikes, speaking never a word. But so soon as the alarm\nwas given, the horsemen suddenly turned head upon the Parthians,\nand with great cries gave charge on them: who at the first\nreceived their charge courageously, for they were joined nearer\nthan within an arrow's \n\n                  . But when the legions also came\nto join with them, shouting out aloud, and rattling of their\narmours, the Parthians, horses and themselves were so afraid\nand amazed withal, that they all turned tail and fled, before\nthe Romans could come to the sword with them. Then Antonius\nfollowed them hard in chase, being in great hope by this conflict\nto have brought to end all or the most part of this war. But\nafter that his footmen had chased them fifty furlongs off, and the\nhorsemen also thrice as far, they found in all but thirty prisoners\ntaken, and about fourscore men only slain: which did much\ndiscourage them, when they considered with themselves, that\nobtaining the victory, they had slain so few of their enemies:\nand when they were overcome, they lost so many of their men,\nas they had done at the overthrow when their \n\n                   was\ntaken. The next morning Antonius, army \n\n                   up their\n\n\n                  , and marched back towards their camp: and by the\nway in their return they met at the first a few of the Parthians;\nthen going on further, they met a few more. So at length when\nthey all came together, they reviled them, and troubled them\non every side, as freshly and courageously as if they had not\nbeen overthrown: so that the Romans very \n\n                   got to their\n\n\n camp with safety. The Medes on the other side, that were\nbesieged in their chief city of Phraata, made a sally out upon\nthem that \n\n                   the mount which they had forced and cast\nagainst the wall of the city, and crave them for fear from the\nmount they kept. Antonius was so offended withal, that he\nexecuted the decimation. For he divided his men by ten legions,\nand then of them he put the tenth legion to death, on whom\nthe lot fell. and for the other nine, he caused them to have\nbarley given them instead of wheat. \n\nThus the war fell out\ntroublesome unto both parties, and the end thereof much more\nfearful; for Antonius could look for no other of his side but\nfamine, because he could forage no more, nor fetch in any\nvictuals, without great loss of his men. Phraortes, on the other\nside, he knew well enough that he could bring the Parthians to\nanything else but to lie in camp abroad in the winter. There\nfore he was afraid, that if the Romans continued their siege all\nwinter long and made war with him still, that his men would\nforsake him, and specially because the time of the year went\naway apace, and the air waxed cloudy and cold in the \nequinoctial autumn. Thereupon he called to mind this device:\nHe gave the chiefest of his gentlemen of the Parthians charge,\nthat when they met the Romans out of their camp, going to\nforage, or to water their horse, or for some other provision,\nthat they should not distress them too much, but should suffer\nthem to carry somewhat away, and greatly commend their\nvaliantness and hardiness, for which their king did esteem them\nthe more, and not without cause. After these first baits and \nallurements, they began by little and little to come nearer unto them,\nand to talk with them a-horseback, greatly blaming Antonius, self\nwill, that did not give their king Phraortes occasion to make a\ngood peace, who desired nothing more than to save the lives of\nso goodly a company of valiant men: but that he was too fondly\nbent to abide two of the greatest and most dreadful enemies\nhe could have, to wit, winter and famine, the which they should\n\n                  , though the Parthians did the best they\ncould to aid and accompany them. These words being often\ntimes brought to Antonius, they made him a little pliant, for\nthe good hope he had of his return: but yet he would not send\nunto the king of Parthia before they had first asked these \nbarbarous people that spake so courteously unto his men, whether\nthey spake it of themselves, or that they were their master's\nwords. When they told them the king himself said so, and\n\n\ndid persuade them further not to fear or mistrust them, then\nAntonius sent some of his friends unto the king, to make\ndemand for the delivery of the ensigns and prisoners he\nhad of the Romans since the overthrow of Crassus, to the end\nit should not appear that, if he asked nothing, they should\nthink he were glad that he might only scape with safety out\nof the danger he was in. The king of Parthia answered him,\nthat, for the ensigns and prisoners he demanded, he should not\n\n\n                   his head about it: notwithstanding that, if he would\n\n\n                   depart without delay, he might depart in peaceable\nmanner, and without danger. Wherefore Antonius, after he\nhad given his men some time to \n\n                   up their \n\n                  , he\nraised his camp, and took his way to depart. But though he\nhad an excellent tongue at will, and very gallant to entertain\nhis soldiers and men of war, and that he could \n\n                   well\ndo it, as well, or better than any captain in his time: yet, being\nashamed for respects, he would not speak unto them at his re\nmoving, but willed Domitius Aenobarbus to do it. Many of them\ntook this in very ill part, and thought that he did it in disdain of\nthem: but the most part of them presently understood the truth \nof\nit, and were also ashamed. Therefore they thought it their duties\nto carry the like respect unto their captain that their captain did\nunto them: and so they became the more obedient unto him.\n\n\n                   So Antonius was minded to return the same way he\ncame, being a plain barren country without wood. But \nthere\ncame a soldier to him, born in the country of the Mardians,\nwho, by oft frequenting the Parthians of long time, knew their\nfashions very well, and had also shewed himself very true and\nfaithful to the Romans in the battle where Antonius, engines of\nbattery and carriage were taken away. This man came unto\nAntonius, to counsel him to beware how he went that way, and\nto make his army a prey (being heavily armed) unto so great a\nnumber of horsemen, all archers in the open field, where they\nshould hate nothing to \n\n                   them to compass him round about:\nand that this was Phraortes, \n\n                  , to offer him so friendly \nconditions and courteous words, to make him raise his siege, that\nhe might afterwards meet him as he would in the plains: \nhowbeit that he would guide him, if he thought good, another way on\nthe right hand, through woods and mountains, a far nearer way,\nand wheel he should find great plenty of all things needful for\nhis army. Antonius hearing what he said, called his counsel\ntogether to consult upon it. For after he had made peace with\n\nthe Parthians, he was loth to give them cause to think he mistrusted\nthem: and on the other side also he would gladly\nshorten his way, and pass by places well inhabited, where he\nmight be provided of all things necessary: therefore he asked\nthe Mardian what pledge he would put in, to perform that he\npromised. The Mardian gave himself to be bound hand and\nfoot, till he had brought his army into the country of Armenia.\nSo he guided the army thus bound, two days together, without\nany trouble or sight of enemy. But the third day Antonius,\nthinking the Parthians would no more follow him, and trusting\ntherein, suffered the soldiers to march in disorder as every man\n\n                  . The Mardian, perceiving that the darns of a river were\nnewly broken up, which they should have passed over, and that\nthe river had overflown the banks and drowned all the way\nthey should have gone, he guessed straight that the Parthians\nhad done it, and had thus broken it open, to stay the Romans\n\n\n                   getting too far before them. Therefore he bade Antonius\nlook to himself, and told him that his enemies were not far from\nthence. Antonius, having set his men in order, as he was placing\nof his archers and sling-men to resist the enemies, and to drive\nthem back, they descried the Parthians that wheeled round about\nthe army to compass them in on every side, and to break their\nranks, and their light-armed men gave charge upon them. So\nafter they had hurt many of the Romans with their arrows, and\nthat they themselves were also hurt by them with their darts and\n\n\n                   of lead, they retired a little, and then came again and\ngave charge, until that the horsemen of the Gauls turned their\nhorses, and fiercely galloped towards them, that they dispersed\nthem so, \n\n                   all that day they gathered no more together.\n\n\nWhereby Antonius knew what to do, and did not only strengthen\nthe \n\n                   of his army, but both the flanks also, with darts\nand sling-men, and made his army march in a square \n\n                  :\ncommanding the horsemen, that when the enemies should come\nto assail them, they should drive them back, but not follow them\ntoo far. Thus the Parthians four days after, seeing they did no\nmore hurt to the Romans than they also received of them, they\nwere not so hot upon them as they were commanded, but excusing\nthemselves by the winter that troubled them, they determined\nto return back again. The \n\n                   day Flavius Gallus, a\nvaliant man of his \n\n                  , that had charge in the army, came\nunto Antonius to pray him to let him have some \n\n                   of his\nlight-armed men than were already in the rereward, and some\n\n\nof the horsemen that were in the \n\n                  , hoping thereby to do\nsome notable exploit. Antonius granting them unto him, when\nthe enemies came according to their manner to set upon the\ntail of the army, and to skirmish with them, Flavius courageously\nmade them retire, but not as they were wont to do before, to\nretire and join presently with their army; for he over rashly\nthrust in among them to fight it out at the sword. The captains\nthat had the leading of the rereward, seeing Flavius stray too\nfar from the army, they sent unto him to \n\n                   him to retire, but\nhe would not hearken to it. And it is reported also, that Titius\nhimself, the treasurer, took the ensigns, and did what he could\nto mate the ensign-bearers return back, reviling Flavius Gallus,\nbecause that through his folly and desperateness he caused many\nhonest and valiant men to be both hurt and slain to no purpose.\nGallus also fell out with him, and commanded his men to stay.\nWherefore Titius returned again into the army, and Gallus still\noverthrowing and driving the enemies back whom he met in the\n\n\n                  , he was not \n\n                   that he was compassed in. Then, seeing\nhimself environed on all sides, he sent unto the army, that\nthey should come and aid him: but there the captains that led the\nlegions (among the which Canidius, a man of great estimation\nabout Antonius, made one) committed many faults. For where\nthey should have made head with the whole army upon the \nParthians, they sent him aid by small companies: and when they\nwere slain, they sent him others also. So that by their \n\n                  \n and lack of consideration, they had like to have made all\nthe army fly, if Antonius himself had not come from the front of\nthe battle with the third legion, the which came through the\n\n\n                   of them that fled, until they came to front the enemies,\nand that they stayed them from chasing any farther. \n\n                  Howbeit at\nthis last conflict there were slain no less \nthan 3000 men, and 5000 besides brought sore hurt into the camp, and amongst them also\nFlavius Gallus, whose body was shot through in four places,\nwhereof he died. Antonius went to the tents to visit and comfort\nthe sick and wounded, and for pity's sake he could not refrain\nfrom weeping: and they also, strewing him the best countenance\nthey could, took him by the hand, and prayed him to\ngo and be dressed, and not to trouble himself for them, most\nreverently calling him their emperor and captain: and that for\nthemselves, they were whole and safe, so that he had his health.\nFor indeed to say truly, there was not at that time any emperor\nor captain that had so great and \n\n                   an army as his together, \n\nboth for lusty youths and courage of soldiers, as also for\ntheir patience to away \n                   so great pains and trouble.   \nFurthermore, the obedience and reverence they shewed unto their\ncaptain, with a marvellous earnest love and good will, was so\ngreat, and all were \n                   (as well great as small, the\nnoble men as mean men, the captains as soldiers) so earnestly\nbent to esteem Antonius good will and favour above their own\nlife and safety, that, in this point of martial discipline, the ancient\nRomans could not have done any more.  But divers things were\ncause thereof, as we have told you before: Antonius nobility\nand ancient house, his eloquence, his plain nature, his liberality\nand magnificence, and familiarity to sport and to be merry in\ncompany; but especially the care he took at that time to help,\nvisit, and lament those that were sick and wounded, seeing\nevery man to have that which was meet for him: that was of such\nforce and effect, as it made them that were sick and wounded to\nlove him better, and were more desirous to do him service, than\nthose that were whole and sound.     \n\nThis victory so encouraged\nthe enemies (who otherwise were weary to follow Antonius any\nfarther) that all night long they \n                   the fields, and hovered\nabout the Romans' camp, thinking that they would presently fly,\nand that then they should take the spoil of their camp.   So the\nnext morning by break of day, there were gathered together a\nfar greater number of the Parthians than they were before.  For\nthe rumour was, that there were not much fewer than 40,000\nhorse, because their king sent thither even the very guard about\nhis person, as unto a most certain and assured victory, that they\nmight be partners of the spoil and booty they hoped to have\nhad: for, as touching the king himself, he was never in any conflict or battle.  Then Antonius, desirous to spe~ik to his soldiers,\ncalled for a black gown, to appear the more pitiful to them: but\nhis friends did dissuade him from it.  Therefore he put on his\n\n                  , and being so apparelled, made an oration to his\narmy: in the which he highly commended them that Lad overcome and driven back their enemies, and greatly rebuked them\nthat had cowardly turned their backs.  So that those which had\novercome prayed him to be of good cheer: the \n                   also, to\nclear themselves, willingly offered to take the lot of decimation\nif he thought good, or otherwise to receive what kind of punishment should please him to lay upon them, so that he would forget any more to \n                  , or to be offended with them.    \nAntonius seeing that, did lift up his hands to heaven, and made his\n\n\nprayer to the gods, that if in exchange of his former victories,\nthey would now send him some bitter adversity, then that all\nmight light on himself alone, and that they would give the victory to the rest of his army.\n\n\n                     The next morning, they gave better order on every side\nof the army, and so marched forward: so that when the Parthians thought to return again to assail them, they came far\nshort of the reckoning.  For where they \n                   to come, not\nto fight, but to spoil and make havoc of all, when they came\nnear them, they were sore hurt with their slings and darts, and\nsuch other javelins as the Romans darted at them, and the Parthians found them as rough and desperate in fight, as if they\nhad been fresh men they had dealt withal.     Whereupon their\nhearts began again to fail them.  But yet when the Romans\ncame to go down any steep hills or mountains, they would set\non them with their arrows, because the Romans could go down\nbut fair and softly.  But then again, the soldiers of the legion\nthat carried great shields, returned back, and enclosed them\nthat were \n                   or light-armed in the midst among them, and\ndid kneel of one knee on the ground, and so set down their\nshields before them: and they of the second rank also covered\nthem of the first rank, and the third also covered the second,\nand so from rank to rank all were covered.   Insomuch that this\nmanner of covering and shading themselves with shields was\ndevised after the fashion of laying tiles upon houses; and to\nsight was like the \n                   of a theatre, and is a most strong\ndefence and bulwark against all arrows and shot that falleth\nupon it.   When the Parthians saw this \n                   of the\nRoman soldiers of the legion which kneeled on the ground in\nthat sort upon one knee, supposing that they had been wearied\nwith travel, they laid down their bows, and took their spears\nand lances, and came to fight with them man for man.    Then\nthe Romans suddenly rose upon their feet, and with the darts\nthat they threw from them they slew the foremost, and put the\nrest to flight, and so did they the next days that followed.\nBut by means of these dangers and \n                  , Antonius army could\nwin no way in a day, by reason whereof they suffered great\nfamine: for they could have but little corn, and yet were they\ndriven daily to fight for it; and besides that, they had no instruments to grind it, to make bread of it.  For the most part\nof them had been left behind, because the beasts that carried\nthem were either dead, or else employed to carry them that were\n\n                                             \n\n\n sore and wounded. For the famine was so extreme great, that\nthe eight part of a bushel of wheat was sold for fifty drachmas,\nand they sold barley bread by the weight of silver. In the end\nthey were compelled to live \n                   herbs and roots, but they found\nfew of them that men do commonly eat of, and were enforced to\ntaste of them that were never eaten before: among the which,\nthere was one that killed them, and made them out of their wits.\nFor he that had once eaten of it, his memory was gone from\nhim, and [he] knew no manner of thing, but only busied himself\nin digging and hurling of stones from one place to another, as\nthough it had been a matter of great \n\n                  , and to be done\nwith all possible speed. All the camp over, men were busily\nstooping to the ground, digging and carrying of stones from one\nplace to another: but at the last, they cast up a great deal of\n\n\n                  , and died suddenly; because they lacked wine, which\nwas the only sovereign remedy to cure that disease. It is\nreported that Antonius, seeing such a number of his men die\ndaily, and that the Parthians left them not, neither would suffer\nthem to be at rest, he oftentimes cried out sighing, and said: \" O\nten thousand!\" He had the valiantness \nof 10,000 Grecians in\nsuch admiration, whom Xenophon brought away after the overthrow\nof Cyrus: because they had come a farther journey from\nBabylon, and had also fought against much \n\n                   enemies many\ntimes told than themselves, and yet came home with safety. \n\nThe\nParthians therefore, seeing that they could not break the good\norder of the army of the Romans, and contrarily, that they themselves\nwere oftentimes put to flight, and \n\n                   beaten,\nthey fell again to their old crafty subtilties. For when they\nfound any of the Romans scattered. from the army to go forage,\nto seek some corn or other victuals, they would come to them as\nif they had been their friends, and shewed them their bows unbent,\nsaying, that themselves also did return home to their country as\nthey did, and that they would follow them no farther: howbeit\nthat they should yet have certain Medes that would follow them\na day's journey or two, to keep them that they should do no hurt\nto the villages from the high-ways; and so holding them with\nthis talk, they gently took their leave of them, and bad them\nfarewell, so that the Romans began again to think themselves\nsafe. Antonius also understanding this, being very glad of it,\ndetermined to take his way through the plain country, because\nalso they should find no water in the mountains, as it was\nreported unto him.\n\n\n                   \n                  So as he was determined to take his course, there came\ninto his host one Mithridates, a gentleman from the enemies'\ncamp, who was cousin unto Moneses that fled unto Antonius,\nand unto whom he had given three cities. When he came to\nAntonius' camp, he prayed them to bring him one that could\nspeak the Parthian or Syrian tongue. So one Alexander Antiochian,\na familiar of Antonius, was brought unto him. Then the\ngentleman told him what he was, and said that Moneses had\nsent him to Antonius, to requite the honour and courtesy he had\nshewed unto him. After he had used this ceremonious speech,\nhe asked Alexander if he saw those high mountains afar off,\nwhich he pointed unto with his finger. Alexander answered he\ndid. \"The Parthians,\" said he, \"do lie in ambush at the foot of\nthose mountains, under the which lieth a goodly plain \n                  \ncountry: and they think that you, being deceived with their\ncrafty subtle words, will leave the way of the mountains, and\nturn into the plain. \n                   the other way, it is very hard and\npainful, and you shall abide great thirst, the which you \nare well\nacquainted withal: but if Antonius take the lower way, let him\nassure himself to run the same fortune that Marcus Crassus did.\"\n\n\nSo Mithridates having said, he departed. Antonius was marvellously\ntroubled in his mind when he heard thus much, and\ntherefore called for his friends, to hear what they would say to\nit. The Mardian also that was their -guide, being asked his\nopinion, answered that he thought as much as the gentleman\nMithridates had said. \"For,\" said he, \"admit that there were\nno ambush of enemies in the valley, yet it is a long crooked way,\nand \n\n                   to \n\n                  : where, taking the mountain way, though it be\nstony and painful, yet there is no other danger but a whole\nday's travelling without any water.\" So Antonius, changing his\nfirst mind and determination, removed that night, and took the\nmountain-way, commanding every man to provide himself \n\n                  \nwater. But the most part of them lacking vessels to carry water\nin, some were driven to fill their \n\n                   and \n\n                   with\nwater, and others also filled goats' skins to carry water in. Now\nthey marching forward, word was brought unto the Parthians\nthat they were removed: whereupon, contrary to their manner,\nthey presently followed them the self-same night, so that by\nbreak of day they overtook the \n\n                   of the Romans, who\nwere so lame and wearied with \n\n                   and lack of sleep, that\nthey were even \n\n                  . For beyond expectation, they had gone\nthat night two hundred and forty furlongs; and further, to see\n\n\ntheir enemies so suddenly at their backs, that made them utterly\ndespair: but most of all, the fighting with them increased their\nthirst, because they were forced to fight as they marched, to\ndrive their enemies back, yet creeping on still. The \n\n                   of\nthe army by chance met with a river that was very clear and\ncold water; but it was salt and venomous to drink. for straight\nit did gnaw the guts of those that had drunk it, and made them\nmarvellous dry, and put them into a terrible ache and pricking.\nAnd notwithstanding that the Mardian had told them of it before,\nyet they would not be ruled, but violently thrust them back\nthat would have kept them from drinking, and so drank. But\nAntonius, going up and down amongst them, prayed them to\ntake a little patience for a while, for hard \n\n                   there was another\nriver that the water was excellent good to drink, and that from\nthenceforth the way was stony and ill for horsemen, that the\nenemies could follow them no further. So he caused the \n\n                  \nto be sounded to call them back that fought, and commanded\nthe tents to be set up, that the soldiers might yet have shadow\nto refresh them with. \n\nSo when the tents were set up, and the\nParthians also retired according to their manner, the gentleman\nMithridates before-named returned again as before, and Alexander\nin like manner again was brought unto him for interpreter.\nThen Mithridates advised him, that after the army had reposed\na little, the Romans should remove forthwith, and with all possible\nspeed get to the river: because the Parthians would go no\nfurther, but yet were cruelly bent to follow them thither. Alexander\ncarried the report thereof unto Antonius, who gave him a\ngreat deal of gold plate to bestow upon Mithridates. Mithridates\ntook as much of him as he could well carry away in his gown,\nand so departed with speed.\n\n So Antonius raised his camp, being yet day-light, and\ncaused all his army to march, and the Parthians never troubled\nany of them by the way: but amongst themselves it was as ill\nand dreadful a night as ever they had. For there were villains\nof their own company who cut their fellows' throats for the money\nthey had, and besides that, robbed the sumpters and \n\n                  \nof such money as they carried, and at length they set upon\nAntonius' slaves that crave his own sumpters and \n                  ; they\nbrake goodly tables and rich plate in pieces, and divided it\namong themselves. Thereupon all the camp was straight in\ntumult and uproar: for the residue of them were afraid it had\nbeen the Parthians that had given them this alarm, and had put\n\n\nall the army out of order. Insomuch that Antonius called for\none Rhamnus, one of his slaves enfranchised that was of his\nguard, and made him give him his faith that he would thrust his\nsword through him when he would bid him, and cut off his head,\nbecause he might not be taken alive of his enemies, nor known\nwhen he were dead. This grieved his friends to the heart, that\nthey burst out a-weeping for sorrow. The Mardian also did\ncomfort him, and assured him that the river he sought for was\nhard by) and that he did guess it by a sweet moist wind that\nbreathed upon them, and by the air which they found fresher\nthan they were wont, and also, for that they fetched their \n\n                  \n\nmore at liberty; and moreover, because that since they did set\nforward, he thought they were near their journey's end, not lacking\nmuch of day. On the other side also Antonius was informed\nthat this great tumult and trouble came not through the enemies,\nbut through the vile covetousness and villany of certain of his\nsoldiers. Therefore Antonius, to set his army again in order,\nand to pacify this uproar, sounded the trumpet that every man\nshould lodge. \n\nNow day began to break, and the army to fall\nagain into good order, and all the hurly\n                   to cease, when\nthe Parthians drew near, and that their arrows lighted among\nthem of the \n\n                   of his army. Thereupon the signal of\nbattle was given to the light-armed men, and the \n\n                   did\ncover themselves as they had done before with their shields,\nwith the which they received and defended the force of the Parthians'\narrows, who never durst any more come to handy \n\n                  \nwith them: and thus they that were in the \n\n                   went down\nby little and little, till at length they espied the river. There\nAntonius placed his armed men upon the sands to receive and\ndrive back the enemies, and first of all) got over his men that\nwere sick and hurt, and afterwards all the rest. And those also\nthat were left to resist the enemies had leisure enough to drink\nsafely and at their pleasure.  For when the Parthians saw the\nriver, they unbent their bows, and bad the Romans pass over\nwithout any fear, and greatly commended their valiantness.\nWhen they had all passed over the river at their ease, they took\na little breath, and so marched forward again, not greatly trusting\nthe Parthians. The sixth day after this last battle, they\ncame to the river of Araxes, which divideth the country of\nArmenia from Media; the which appeared unto them very\ndangerous to pass, for the depth and swiftness of the stream.\nAnd furthermore there ran a rumour through the camp, that the\n\n\nParthians lay in ambush thereabouts, and that they would come\nand set upon them whilst they were troubled in passing over\nthe river. But now, after they were all come safely over without\nany danger, and that they had gotten to the other side, into the\nprovince of Armenia, then they worshipped that land, as if it had\nbeen the first land they had seen after a long and dangerous\nvoyage by sea, being now arrived in a safe and happy haven:\nand the tears ran down their cheeks, and every man embraced\neach other for the great joy they had. But now, keeping the\nfields in this fruitful country so plentiful of all things, after so\ngreat a famine and want of all things, they so crammed themselves\nwith such plenty of victuals, that many of them were cast\ninto fluxes and dropsies. \n\n                  There Antonius, mustering his whole\narmy, found that he had lost 20,000 footmen, and 4000  horsemen,\nwhich had not all been slain by their enemies: for the\nmost part of them died of sickness, making seven and twenty\ndays' journey coming from the city of Phraata into Armenia, and\nhaving overcome the Parthians in eighteen several battles. But\nthese victories were not throughly performed nor accomplished,\nbecause they followed no long chase: and thereby it easily appeared,\nthat Artabazus king of Armenia had kept Antonius from\nending this war. For if the sixteen thousand \nhorsemen which\nhe brought with him out of Media had been at these battles\n'considering that they were armed and apparelled \nmuch after\nthe Parthian manner, and acquainted also with their fight, when\nthe Romans had put them to flight that had fought a battle with\nthem, and that these Armenians had followed the chase of them\nthat fled) they had not gathered themselves again in force,\nneither durst they also have returned to fight with them so often\nafter they had been so many times overthrown. Therefore all\nthose that were of any credit and countenance in the army did\npersuade and \n\n                   Antonius to be revenged of this Armenian\nking: but Antonius, wisely dissembling his anger, he told him\nnot of his treachery, nor gave him the worse \n\n                  , nor\ndid him less honour than he did before: because he knew his\narmy was weak, and lacked things necessary. Howbeit afterwards\nhe returned again into Armenia with a great army, and\nso with fair words and sweet promises of messengers, he allured\nArtabazus to come to him: whom he then kept prisoner, and\nled in triumph in the city of Alexandria This greatly offended\nthe Romans, and made them much to \n\n                   it, when they\nsaw that for Cleopatra's sake he deprived his country of her due\n\n\nhonour and glory, only to gratify the Egyptians. But this was\na pretty while after.\n\n Howbeit then, the great haste he made to return unto\nCleopatra caused him to put his men to so great pains, forcing\nthem to lie in the field all winter long when \n\nit \n\n                   unreasonably,\nthat by the way he lost eight thousand of his men, and so\ncame down to the sea-side with a small company, unto a certain\nplace called Blancbourg: which standeth betwixt the cities of\nBerytus and Sidon, and there tarried for Cleopatra. And because\nshe tarried longer than he would have had her, he pined\naway for love and sorrow: so that he was at such a \n\n                  ,\nthat he wist not what to do, and therefore, to wear it out, he\ngave himself to quaffing and feasting. But he was so drowned\nwith the love of her, that he could not abide to sit at the table\ntill the feast was ended: but many times, while others banqueted,\nhe ran to the sea-side to see if she were coming. At length she\ncame, and brought with her a world of apparel and money to\ngive unto the soldiers. But some say notwithstanding that she\nbrought apparel and no money, and that she took of Antonius'\nmoney, and caused it to be given amongst the soldiers in her\nown name, as if she had given it them.\n\n\n                   In the meantime it chanced that the king of the Medes\nand Phraortes, king of the Parthians, fell at great wars together,\nthe which began (as it is reported) for the spoils of the Romans:\nand grew to be so hot between them that the king of Medes was\nno less afraid than also in danger to lose his whole realm. Thereupon\nhe sent unto Antonius, to pray him to come and make war\nwith the Parthians, promising him that he would aid him to\nhis uttermost power. This put Antonius again in good comfort,\nconsidering that, unlooked for, the only thing he lacked\n(which made him he could not overcome the Parthians, meaning\nthat he had not brought horsemen, and men with darts and\nslings enough) was offered him in that sort, that it did him more\npleasure to accept it than it was pleasure to the other to offer it.\nHereupon, after he had spoken with the king of Medes at the\nriver of Araxes, he prepared himself once more to go through\nArmenia, and to make more cruel war with the Parthians than\nhe had done before.\n\n\n                   Now whilst Antonius was busy in this preparation,\nOctavia his wife, whom he had left at Rome, would needs take\nsea to come unto him. Her brother Octavius Caesar was willing\nto it, not for his respect at all (as most authors do report) as for\n\n\n that he might have an \n\n                   \n                  \n                   to make war with Antonius,\nif he did misuse her, and not esteem of her as she ought to\nbe. But when she was come to Athens, she received letters\nfrom Antonius, \n\n                   her to stay there until his coming, and\ndid \n\n                   her of his journey and determination. The which\nthough it grieved her much, and that she knew it was but an\nexcuse: yet by her letters to him of answer, she asked him\nwhether he would have those things sent unto him which she\nhad brought him, being great store of apparel for soldiers, a\ngreat number of horse, sums of money and gifts, to bestow on\nhis friends and captains he had about him: and besides all\nthose, she had 2000 soldiers, chosen men, all well armed like\nunto the Praetor's bands. When Niger, one of Antonius' friends\nwhom he had sent unto Athens, had brought these news from\nhis wife Octavia, and withal did greatly praise her, as she was\nworthy and well deserved, Cleopatra, knowing that Octavia\nwould have Antonius from her, and fearing also that if with her\nvirtue and honest behaviour (besides the great power of her\nbrother Caesar) she did add \"hereunto her modest kind love to\nplease her husband, that she would then be too strong for her,\nand in the end win him away: she subtly seemed to languish\nfor the love of Antonius, pining her body for lack of meat. Furthermore,\nshe every way so framed her countenance, that when\nAntonius came to see her, she cast her eyes upon him, like a\nwoman ravished for joy. Straight again when he went from her,\nshe fell a-weeping and blubbering, looking ruefully on the matter,\nand \n\n                   found the means that Antonius should oftentimes find\nher weeping: and then when he came suddenly upon her, she\nmade as though she dried her eyes, and turned her face away,\nas if she were unwilling that he should see her weep. All these\ntricks she used, Antonius being in readiness to go into Syria, to\nspeak with the king of Medes. Then the flatterers that furthered\nCleopatra's mind blamed Antonius, and told him that he was a\nhard-natured man, and that he had small love in him, that\nwould see a poor lady in such torment for his sake, whose life\ndepended only upon him alone. \"For Octavia,\" said they,\n\" that was married unto him as it were of necessity, because her\nbrother Caesar's affairs so required it, hath the honour to be\ncalled Antonius' lawful spouse and wife: and Cleopatra, being\nborn a queen of so many thousands of men, is only named\nAntonius' \n\n                  ; and yet that she disdained not so to be\ncalled, if it might please him she might enjoy his company, and\n\n\nlive with him: but if he once leave her, that then it is \n\n                  \nshe should live.\" To be short, by these their flatteries and\nenticements, they so wrought Antonius' effeminate mind that,\nfearing lest she would make herself away, he returned again\nunto Alexandria, and \n\n                   the king of Medes to the next\nyear following, although he received news that the Parthians at\nthat time were at civil wars among themselves. This notwithstanding,\nhe went afterwards and made peace with him. For\nhe married his daughter, which was very young, unto one of the\nsons that Cleopatra had by him: and then returned' teeing fully\nbent to make war with Caesar.\n\n\n                   \n                  When Octavia was returned to Rome from Athens,\nCaesar commanded her to go out of Antonius' house, and to\ndwell by herself, because he had \n\n                   her. Octavia answered\nhim again, that she would not forsake her husband's house, and\nthat if he had no other occasion to make war with him, she\nprayed him then to take no thought for her: '` For,\" said she, \"it\nwere too shameful a thing, that two so famous captains should\nbring in civil wars among the Romans, the one for the love of a\nwoman, and the other for the jealousy betwixt one another.''\nNow as she spake the word, so did she also perform the deed:\nfor she kept still in Antonius' house, as if he had been there, and\nvery honestly and honourably kept his children, not only those\nshe had by him, but the other which her husband had by Fulvia.\nFurthermore, when Antonius sent any of his men to Rome, to\nsue for any office in the commonwealth, she received them very\ncourteously, and so used herself unto her brother, that she obtained\nthe things she requested. Howbeit thereby, thinking no\nhurt, she did Antonius great hurt. For her honest love and\nregard to her husband made every man hate him, when they\nsaw he did so unkindly use so noble a lady: but the greatest\ncause of their malice unto him was for the division of lands he\nmade among his children in the city of Alexandria. And, to\nconfess a \n                  , it was too arrogant and insolent a part, and\ndone (as a man would say) in derision and contempt of the\nRomans. For he assembled all the people in the show-place,\nwhere young men do exercise themselves, and there, upon a\nhigh tribunal silvered, he set two chairs of gold, the one for\nhimself, and the other for Cleopatra, and lower chairs for his\nchildren; then he openly published before the assembly, that\nfirst of all he did establish Cleopatra queen of Egypt, of Cyprus,\nof Lydia, and of the lower Syria; and at that time also Caesarion\n\n\n king of the same realms. This Caesarion was supposed to be\nthe son of Julius Caesar, who had left Cleopatra great with child.\nSecondly, he called the sons he had by her the kings of kings,\nand gave Alexander for his portion Armenia, Media, and\nParthia, when he had conquered the country; and unto Ptolemy\nfor his portion Phoenicia, Syria, and Cilicia And therewithal he\nbrought out Alexander in a long gown after the fashion of the\nMedes with a high \n                   hat on his head, narrow in the\ntop, as the kings of the Medes and Armenians do use to wear\nthem: and Ptolemy apparelled in a cloak after the Macedonian\nmanner, with slippers on his feet and a broad hat, with a royal\nband or diadem. Such was the apparel and old attire of the\nancient kings and successors of Alexander the Great. So after\nhis sons had done their humble duties,-and kissed their father\nand mother, presently a company of Armenian soldiers, set\nthere of purpose, compassed the one about, and a like company\nof Macedonians the other. Now for Cleopatra, she did not\nonly wear at that time (but at all other times else when she\ncame abroad) the apparel of the goddess Isis, and so gave audience\nunto all her subjects! as a new Isis.\n\n\n                  \n                  Octavius Caesar reporting all these things unto the\nSenate, and oftentimes accusing him to the whole people and\nassembly in Rome, he thereby stirred up all the Romans against\nhim. Antonius on the other side sent to Rome likewise to accuse\nhim, and the chiefest points of his accusations he charged\nhim with, were these. First, that having spoiled Sextus Pompeius\nin Sicily, he did not give him his part of the \n\n                  . Secondly,\nthat he did detain in his hands the ships he lent him to make\nthat war. Thirdly, that having put Lepidus their companion and\n\n\n                   out of his part of the empire, and having deprived\nhim of all honours, he retained for himself the lands and revenues\nthereof, which had been assigned unto him for his part.\nAnd last of all, that he had in \n\n                   divided all Italy amongst\nhis own soldiers, and had left no part of it for his soldiers.\nOctavius Caesar answered him again: that \n\n                   Lepidus, he had\nindeed deposed him, and taken his part of the empire from him,\nbecause he did over cruelly use his authority. And secondly, \n\n                  \nthe conquests he had made by force of arms, he was contented\nAntonius should have his part of them, so that he would likewise\nlet him have his part of Armenia. And thirdly, that, \n\n                   his\nsoldiers, they should seek for nothing in Italy, because they\npossessed Media and Parthia, the which provinces they had\n\n\nadded to the empire of Rome, valiantly fighting with their\nemperor and captain. \n\n                  Antonius hearing these news, being yet\nin Armenia, commanded Canidius to go presently to the sea-side\nwith his sixteen legions he had: and he himself, with Cleopatra,\nwent unto the city of Ephesus, and there gathered together his\ngalleys and ships out of all parts, which came to the number of\neight hundred, reckoning the great ships of burthen: and of\nthose, Cleopatra furnished him with two hundred and twenty\nthousand talents besides, and provision of victuals also to maintain\nall the whole army in this war. So Antonius, through the\npersuasion of Domitius, commanded Cleopatra to return again\ninto Egypt, and there to \n\n                   the \n\n                   of this war.\nBut Cleopatra, fearing lest Antonius should again be made\nfriends with Octavius Caesar by the means of his wife Octavia,\nshe so plied Canidius with money and filled his purse, that\nhe became her spokesman unto Antonius, and told him there\nwas no reason to send her from this war, who defrayed so great\na \n\n                  : neither that it was for his profit, because thereby the\nEgyptians would then be utterly discouraged, which were the\nchiefest strength of the army by sea: considering that he could\nsee no king of all the kings their confederates that Cleopatra was\ninferior unto, either for wisdom or judgment, seeing that long\nbefore she had wisely governed so great a realm as Egypt; and\nbesides that, she had been so long acquainted with him, by\nwhom she had learned to manage great affairs. These fair persuasions\n\n\n                   him: for it was predestinated that the government\nof all the world should fall into Octavius Caesar's hands.\n\n \n                  Thus, all their forces being joined together, they \n\n                  \nsail towards the \n\n                   of Samos. and there gave themselves to\nfeasts and solace. For as all the kings, princes, and commonalties,\npeople, and cities, from Syria unto the marrishes\n\n\n                  , and from the Armenians to the Illyrians, were sent\nunto, to send and bring all munition and warlike preparation\nthey could: even so all players, minstrels, tumblers, fools, and\nfesters, were commanded to assemble in the \n\n                   of Samos. So\nthat, where in manner all the world in every place was full of\nlamentations, sighs, and tears, only in this \n\n                   of Samos there\nwas nothing for many days' space but singing and piping, and\nall the theatre full of these common players, minstrels, and singing\n-men. Besides all this, every city sent an ox thither to\nsacrifice, and kings did strive one with another who should\nmake the noblest feasts, and give the richest gifts. So that\n\n\n every man said, \"What can they do more for joy of victory, if\nthey win the battle, when they make already such sumptuous\nfeasts at the beginning of the war ?\" \n\nWhen this was done, he\ngave the whole rabble of these minstrels, and such kind of\npeople, the city of Priene to keep them withal during this war.\nThen he went unto the city of Athens, and there gave himself\nagain to see plays and pastimes, and to keep the theatres.\nCleopatra, on the other side, being jealous of the honours which\nOctavia had received in this city, where indeed she was marvellously\nhonoured and beloved of the Athenians; to win the\npeople's goodwill also at Athens, she gave them great gifts:\nand they likewise gave her many great honours and appointed\ncertain ambassadors to carry the decree to her house,\namong the which Antonius was one, who (as a citizen of Athens)\nreported the matter unto her, and made an oration in the behalf\nof the city. Afterwards he sent to Rome to put his wife Octavia\nout of his house, who (as it is reported) went out of his house\nwith all Antonius' children, saving the eldest of them he had by\nFulvia, who was with his father: bewailing and lamenting her\ncursed \n\n                  , that had brought her to this, that she was accounted\none of the chiefest causes of this civil war. The Romans did\npity her, but much more Antonius, and those specially that had\nseen Cleopatra: who neither excelled Octavia in beauty, nor yet\nin young years.\n\n\n                   Octavius Caesar understanding the sudden and wonderful\ngreat preparation of Antonius, he was not a little \n\n                   at\nit (fearing he should be driven to fight that summer) because he\nwanted many things, and the great and grievous exactions of\nmoney did sore oppress the people. For all manner of men else\nwere driven to pay the fourth part of their goods and revenue,\nbut the libertines (to wit, those whose fathers or other predecessors\nhad sometime been bondmen) were \n\n                   to pay the \n\n                  \npart of all their goods at one payment. Hereupon there arose a\nwonderful exclamation and great uproar all Italy over, so that,\namongst the greatest faults that ever Antonius committed, they\nblamed him most for that he delayed to give Caesar battle. For\nhe gave Caesar leisure to make his preparations, and also to\nappease the complaints of the people. When such a great sum\nof money was demanded of them, they \n\n                    at it, and grew\nto mutiny upon it: but when they had once paid it, they remembered\nit no more. Furthermore, Titius and Plancus (two\nof Antonius' chiefest friends, and that had been both of them\n\n\nconsuls) for the great injuries Cleopatra did them, because they\nhindered all they could that she should not come to this war,\nthey went and yielded themselves unto Caesar, and told him\nwhere the \n                   was that Antonius had made, knowing\nperfectly what was in it. The will was in the custody of the\nVestal nuns: of whom Caesar demanded it. They answered\nhim, that they would not give it him: but if he would go and\ntake it, they would not hinder him. Thereupon Caesar went\nthither, and having read it first to himself, he noted certain\n\n\n                   worthy of reproach: so assembling all the Senate, he\nread it before them all. Whereupon divers were marvellously\noffended, and thought it a strange matter that he, being alive,\nshould be punished for that he had appointed by his will to be\ndone after his death. Caesar chiefly took hold of this that\nhe ordained touching his burial: for he willed that his body,\nthough he died at Rome, should be brought in funeral pomp\nthrough the \n\n                   of the market-place, and that it should be\nsent into Alexandria unto Cleopatra. Furthermore, among\ndivers other faults wherewith Antonius was to be charged for\nCleopatra's sake, Calvisius, one of Caesar's friends, reproved him,\nbecause he had frankly given Cleopatra all the libraries of the\nroyal city of Pergamum, in the which she had above two hundred\nthousand several books. Again also, that being on a time\nset at the table, he suddenly rose from the board and trod upon\nCleopatra's foot, which was a sign given between them, of which\nthey were agreed on. That he had also suffered the Ephesians\nin his presence to call Cleopatra their sovereign lady.\nThat divers times, sitting in his tribunal and chair of state,\ngiving audience to all kings and princes, he had received loveletters\nfrom Cleopatra, written in \n\n                   of onyx or crystal; and\nthat he had read them sitting in his imperial seat. That one\nday when Furnius, a man of great account, and the eloquentest\nman of all the Romans, pleaded a matter before him, Cleopatra\nby chance coming through the market-place in her litter where\nFurnius was a-pleading, Antonius straight rose out of his seat,\nand left his audience to follow her litter. \n\nThis notwithstanding,\nit was thought Calvisius devised the most part of all these accusations\n of his own head. Nevertheless they that loved Antonius\nwere intercessors to the people for him, and amongst them\nthey sent one Geminius unto Antonius, to pray him he would\ntake heed that through his negligence his empire were not taken\nfrom him, and that he should be counted an enemy to the people\n\n\n of Rome. This Geminius, being arrived in Greece, made Cleopatra\njealous straight of his coming, because she surmised that he\ncame not but to speak for Octavia. Therefore she spared not\nto taunt him all supper-time; and moreover, to spite him the\nmore, she made him to be set lowest of all at the board: the which\nhe took patiently, \n                   \n                  \n                   to speak with Antonius.\nNow Antonius commanding him at the table to tell him what\nwind brought him thither, he answered, 'That it was no tabletalk,\nand that he would tell him to-morrow morning fasting: but\ndrunk or fasting, howsoever it were, he was sure of one thing,\nthat all would not go well on his side, unless Cleopatra were\nsent back into Egypt.' Antonius took these words in very ill\npart. Cleopatra on the other side answered him, \"Thou doest\nwell, Geminius,\" said she, \"to tell the truth before thou be compelled\nby torments'' but within few days after, Geminius stole\naway, and fled to Rome. The flatterers also, to please Cleopatra,\ndid make her drive many other of Antonius' faithful servants\nand friends from him, who could not abide the injuries done\nunto them: among the which these two were chief, Marcus\nSyllanus, and Dellius the historiographer, who wrote that he fled\nbecause her physician Glaucus told him that Cleopatra had set\nsome secretly to kill him. Furthermore, he had Cleopatra's displeasure,\nbecause he said one night at supper, that they made\nthem drink sour wine, \n\n                   Sarmentus at Rome drank good\nwine of Falerna. This Sarmentus was a pleasant young boy,\nsuch as the lords of Rome are wont to have about them to make\nthem pastime, which they call their joys, and he was Octavius\nCaesar's boy. \n\n                  Now after that Caesar had made sufficient preparation,\nhe proclaimed open war against Cleopatra, and made the\npeople to abolish the power and empire of Antonius, because he\nhad before given it up unto a woman. And Caesar said furthermore,\nthat Antonius was not master of himself, but that Cleopatra\nhad brought him beside himself by her charms and amorous\npoisons: and that they, that should make war with them, should\nbe Mardian the eunuch, Photinus, and Iras (a woman of\nCleopatra's bed-chamber, that \n\n                   her hair, and dressed her\nhead) and Charmion, the which were those that ruled all the\naffairs of Antonius' empire.\n\n \n                  Before this war, as it is reported, many signs and wonders\nfell out. First of all, the city of Pisaurum, which was made a\ncolony to Rome, and replenished with people by Antonius,\nstanding upon the shore-side of the sea Adriatic, was by a \n\nterrible earthquake sunk into the ground. One of the images of\nstone, which was set up in the honour of Antonius in the city of\nAlba, did sweat many days together: and though some wiped it\naway, yet it \n\n                   not sweating still. In the city of Patras, whilst\nAntonius was there, the temple of Hercules was burnt with\nlightning. And at the city of Athens also, in a place where the\nwar of the giants against the gods is set out in \n\n                  , the\nstatue of Bacchus with a terrible wind was thrown down in the\ntheatre. It was said that Antonius came of the race of Hercules\n(as you have heard before), and in the manner of his life he\nfollowed Bacchus, and therefore he was called the new Bacchus.\nFurthermore, the same blustering storm of wind overthrew the\ngreat monstrous images at Athens that were made in the honour\nof Eumenes and Attalus, the which men had named and \n\n                   \n'the Antonians': and yet did they hurt none of the\nother images, which were many besides. The admiral-galley of\nCleopatra was called Antontiad, in the which there chanced a\nmarvellous ill sign: swallows had bred under the poop of her\nship, and there came others after them that crave away the first,\nand plucked down their nests.\n\n\n                  \n                  Now when all things were ready, and that they drew\nnear to fight, it was found, that Antonius had no less \nthan 500 good ships of war, among which there were many galleys that\nhad eight and ten banks of oars, the which were sumptuously\nfurnished, not so meet for fight as for triumph: an hundred\nthousand footmen, and 12,000 horsemen; and had with him to\naid him these kings and subjects following: Bocchus king of\nLybia, Tarcondemus king of high Cilicia, Archelaus king of\nCappadocia, Philadelphus king of Paphlagonia, Mithridates\nking of Comagena, and Adallas king of Thracia. All which\nwere there, every man in person. The residue that were absent,\nsent their armies: as Polemon king of Pont, Manchus king of\nArabia, Herodes king of \n\n                  ; and furthermore Amyntas king of\nLycaonia and of the Galatians: and besides all these, he had all\nthe aid the king of Medes sent unto him. Now for Caesar, he\n\nhad 250 ships of war, 80,000 footmen, and well near as many\nhorsemen as his enemy Antonius. Antonius for his part had all\nunder his dominion from Armenia and the river of Euphrates,\nunto the sea Ionium and Illyricum. Octavius Caesar had also,\nfor his part, all that which was in our hemisphere or half-part of\nthe world, from Illyria unto the ocean sea upon the west: then\nall from the ocean unto mare Siculum: and from Africa, all\n\nthat which is against Italy, as Gaul and Spain. Furthermore,\nall, from the province of Cyrenia to Ethiopia, was subject unto\nAntonius. \n\n\n                  Now Antonius was made so subject to a woman's\nwill, that though he was a great deal the stronger by land, yet\nfor Cleopatra's sake he would needs have this battle tried by\nsea: though he saw before his eyes, that for lack of \n                  \nhis captains did \n\n                   by force all sorts of men out of Greece\nthat they could take up in the field, as travellers, muleteers,\nreapers, harvest-men, and young boys; and yet could they not\nsufficiently furnish his galleys: so that the most part of them\nwere empty, and could \n\n                   row, because they lacked \n\n                   \nenough. But on the contrary side, Caesar's ships were not\nbuilt for pomp, high and great, only for a sight and \n\n                  ,\nbut they were light of \n\n                  , armed and furnished with watermen\nas many as they needed, and had them all in readiness in\nthe havens of Tarentum and Brundusium.   So Octavius Caesar\nsent unto Antonius, to \n\n                   him to delay no more time, but to\ncome on with his army into Italy: and that for his own part he\nwould give him safe harbour to land without any trouble; and\nthat he would withdraw his army from the sea, as far as one\nhorse could run, until he had put his army ashore, and had\nlodged his men. Antonius on the other side bravely sent\nhim word again and challenged the combat of him, man\nfor man, though he were the elder; and that if he refused\nhim so, he would then fight a battle with him in the fields\nof Pharsalia, as Julius Caesar and Pompey had done before.\nNow whilst Antonius rode at anchor, lying idly in harbour\nat the head of Actium, in the place where the city of Nicopolis\nstandeth at this present, Caesar had quickly passed the sea\nIonium and taken a place called Toryne, before Antonius understood\n7 that he had taken ship. Then began his men to be afraid,\nbecause his army by land was left behind. But Cleopatra making\nlight of it, \"And what danger, I pray you,\" said she, \" if Caesar\nkeep at \n                  ?\"\n\nThe next morning by break of day, his\nenemies coming with full force of oars in battle against him,\nAntonius was afraid that if they came to join, they would take\nand carry away his ships that had no men of war in them. So\nhe armed all his water-men, and set them in order of battle\nupon the forecastle of their ships, and then \n\n                   up all his ranks\nof oars towards the \n\n                  , as well on the one side as on the\nother, with the prows against the enemies, at the entry and\nmouth of the gulf which beginneth at the point of Actium: and\n\n\nso kept them in order of battle, as if they had been armed and\nfurnished with water-men and soldiers. Thus Octavius Caesar,\nbeing finely deceived by this stratagem, retired presently, and\ntherewithal Antonius very wisely and suddenly did cut him\noff from fresh water. For, understanding that the places ``here\nOctavius Caesar landed had very little store of water, and yet\nvery bad, he shut them in with strong ditches and trenches he\ncast, to keep them from sailing out at their pleasure, and so to\ngo seek water farther off. Furthermore, he dealt very friendly\nand courteously with Domitius, and against Cleopatra's mind.\nFor he being sick of an ague when he went and took a little\nboat to go unto Caesar's camp, Antonius was very sorry for it,\nbut yet he sent after him all his \n                  , train, and men: and\nthe same Domitius, as though he gave him to understand that\nhe repented his open treason, died immediately after. There\nwere certain kings also that forsook him, and turned on Caesar's\nside, as Amyntas and Deiotarus. Furthermore, his fleet and\nnavy that was unfortunate in all things, and unready for service,\ncompelled him to change his mind, and to hazard battle by\nland. And Canidius also, who had charge of his army by land,\nwhen time came to follow Antonius' determination, he \nturned\nhim clean contrary, and counselled him to send Cleopatra back\nagain, and himself to retire into Macedon, to fight there on the\nmain land. And furthermore told him, that Dicomes king of\nthe Getes promised to aid him with a great power: and that it\nshould be no shame nor dishonour to him to let Caesar have the I\nsea, because himself and his men both had been well practiced\nand exercised in battles by sea, in the war of Sicilia against\nSextus Pompeius: but rather that he should do against all\nreason (he having so great skill and experience of battles by\nland as he had), if he should not employ the force and \nvaliantness of so many lusty armed footmen as he had ready, but\nwould weaken his army by dividing them into ships. But now,\nnotwithstanding all these good persuasions, Cleopatra forced\nhim to put all to the hazard of battle by sea: considering with\nherself how she might fly and provide for her safety, not to help\nhim to win the victory, but to fly more easily after the battle lost.\nBetwixt Antonius' camp and his fleet of ships, there was a great\nhigh point of firm land that ran a good way into the sea, the\nwhich Antonius used often for a walk, without mistrust of fear\nor danger. One of Caesar's men perceived it, and told his\nmaster that he would laugh if they could take up Antonius in\n\n\n the \n\n                   of his walk. Thereupon Caesar sent some of his\nmen to lie in ambush for him, and they missed not much of\ntaking him (for they took him that came before him) because\nthey \n\n                   too soon, and so Antonius scaped very \n\n                  .\n\n\nSo when Antonius had determined to fight by sea, he set all the\nother ships on fire but three score ships of Egypt, and reserved\nonly the best and greatest galleys, from three banks unto ten\nbanks of oars Into them he put two and twenty thousand\nfighting men, with two thousand darters and slingers. Now as\nhe was setting his men in order of battle, there was a captain, a\nvaliant man, that had served Antonius in many battles and conflicts,\nand had all his body hacked and cut: who, as Antonius\npassed by him, cried out unto him, and said: \"O noble emperor,\nhow cometh it to pass that you trust to these vile brittle\nships? What, do you mistrust these wounds of mine, and this\nsword? Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians fight by sea, and set\nus on the main land, where we \n\n                   to conquer or to be slain on\nour feet.\" Antonius passed by him and said never a word, but\nonly beckoned to him with his hand and head, as though he\nwilled him to be of good courage, although indeed he had no\ngreat courage himself. For when the masters of the galleys and\npilots would have let their sails alone, he made them \n\n                   them\non; saying, to \n\n                   the matter withal, that not one of his\nenemies should scape. \n\nAll that day and the three days following,\nthe sea rose so high and was so boisterous, that the battle was\nput off. The \n\n                   day the storm ceased, and the sea calmed\nagain, and then they rowed with force of oars in battle one\nagainst the other: Antonius leading the right wing with Publicola,\nand Caelius the left, and Marcus Octavius and Marcus Justeius\nthe midst. Octavius Caesar, on the other side, had placed Agrippa\nin the left wing of his army, and had kept the right wing for\nhimself. \n\n                   the armies by land, Canidius was general of\nAntonius' side, and Taurus of Caesar's side: who kept their men\nin battle \n\n                  , the one before the other, upon the sea-side, without\nstirring one against the other. Further, touching both the\nchieftains: Antonius, being in a swift pinnace, was carried up\nand down by force of oars through his army, and spake to his\npeople to encourage them to fight valiantly, as if they were on\nmain land, because of the steadiness and heaviness of their\nships: and commanded the pilots and masters of the galleys,\nthat they should not stir, none otherwise than if they were at\nanchor, and so to receive the first charge of their enemies, and\n\n\nthat they should not go out of the \n\n                   of the gulf. Caesar\nbetimes in the morning going out of his tent, to see his ships\nthroughout, met a man by chance that crave an ass before him:\nCaesar asked the man what his name was. The poor man told\nhim that his name was Eutychus, to \n\n                  , Fortunate: and his\nass's name Nicon, to say, Conqueror. Therefore Caesar, after he\nhad won the battle, setting out the market-place with the spurs\nof the galleys he had taken, for a sign of his victory, he caused\nalso the man and his ass to be set up in brass. When he had\nvisited the order of his army throughout, he took a little pinnace,\nand went to the right wing, and wondered when he saw his\nenemies lie still in the \n\n                  , and stirred not. For discerning I\nthem afar off, men would have thought they had been ships\nriding at anchor: and a good while he was so persuaded. So he\nkept his galleys eight furlongs from his enemies. About noon\nthere arose a little gale of wind from the sea, and then Antonius'\nmen, waxing angry with tarrying so long, and trusting to the\ngreatness and height of their ships, as if they had been invincible,\nthey began to march forward with their left wing. Caesar,\nseeing that, was a glad man, and began a little to give back\nfrom the right wing, to allure them to come farther out of the\n\n\n                   and gulf, to the end that he might with his light ships,\nwell manned with watermen, turn and environ the galleys of\nthe enemies, the which were heavy of \n\n                  , both for their\nbigness, as also for lack of water-men to row them. \n\nWhen the\nskirmish began, and that they came to join, there was no great\nhurt at the first meeting, neither did the ships vehemently hit\none against the other, as they do commonly in fight by sea. For\non the other side Antonius' ships, for their heaviness, could not\nhave the strength and swiftness to make their blows of any\nforce: and Caesar's ships on the other side took great heed not\nto rush and shock with the forecastles of Antonius' ships, whose\nprows were armed with great brazen spurs. Furthermore they\ndurst not flank them, because their points were easily broken,\nwhich way soever they came to set upon his ships, that were\nmade of great main square pieces of timber, bound together\nwith great iron pins: so that the battle was much like unto a\nbattle by land, or to speak more properly, to the assault of a\ncity. For there were always three or four of Caesar's ships\nabout one of Antonius' ships, and the soldiers fought with their\npikes, \n\n                   and darts, and threw halbards and darts with\nfire. Antonius' ships on the other side bestowed among them,\n\n\n with their crossbows and engines of battery, great store of shot\nfrom their high towers of wood that were set upon their ships.\nNow Publicola seeing Agrippa put forth his left wing of Caesar's\narmy, to compass in Antonius' ships that fought, he was driven\nalso to \n\n                   off to have more room, and to go a little at one\nside, to put those farther off that were afraid, and in the midst\nof the battle, for they were sore distressed by Arruntius.\n\n \n                  Howbeit the battle was yet of even hand, and the victory\ndoubtful, being indifferent to both: when suddenly they saw the\nthreescore ships of Cleopatra busily about their yard-masts, and\n\n\n                   sail to fly. So they fled through the \n\n                   of them\nthat were in fight, for they had been placed behind the great\nships, and did marvellously disorder the other ships. For the\nenemies themselves wondered much to see them sail in that\nsort, with full sail towards Peloponnesus. There Antonius\nshewed plainly, that he had not only lost the courage and heart\nof an emperor, but also of a valiant man; and that he was not\nhis own man (proving that true which an old man spake in\nmirth, that the soul of a lover lived in another body, and not in\nhis own); he was so carried away with the vain love of this\nwoman, as if he had been glued unto her, and that she could\nnot have removed without moving of him also. For when he\nsaw Cleopatra's ship under sail, he forgot, forsook, and betrayed\nthem that fought for him, and \n\n                   upon a galley with five\nbanks of oars, to follow her that had already begun to overthrow\nhim, and would in the end be his utter destruction. \n\nWhen she\nknew his galley afar off, she \n\n                   up a sign in the poop of her\nship; and so Antonius, coming to it, was plucked up where\nCleopatra was: howbeit he saw her not at his first coming, nor\nshe him, but went and sat down alone in the prow of his ship,\nand said never a word, clapping his head between both his\nhands. In the meantime came certain light brigantines of\nCaesar's, that followed him hard. So Antonius straight turned\nthe prow of his ship, and \n\n                   put the rest to flight, saving\none Eurycles a Lacedaemonian, that followed him near, and\npressed upon him with great courage, shaking a dart in his\nhand over the prow, as though he would have thrown it unto\nAntonius. Antonius seeing him, came to the forecastle of his\nship, and asked him what he was that durst follow Antonius so\nnear? \" I am,\" answered he, \"Eurycles the son of Lachares,\nwho through Caesar's good fortune seeketh to revenge the death\nof my father.\" This Lachares was condemned of felony, and\n\n\nbeheaded by Antonius. But yet Eurycles durst not venture\nupon Antonius' ship, but set upon the other admiral galley (for\nthere were two), and fell upon him with such a blow of his\nbrazen spur that was so heavy and big, that he turned her\nround, and took her, with another that was \n\n                   with very\nrich stuff and \n\n                  . After Eurycles had left Antonius, he\nturned again to his place, and sat down, speaking never a word,\nas he did before: and so lived three days alone, without speaking\nto any man. But when he arrived at the head of Taenarus,\nthere Cleopatra's women first brought Antonius and Cleopatra\nto speak together, and afterwards to sup and lie together. Then\nbegan there again a great number of merchants' ships to gather\nabout them, and some of their friends that had escaped from\nthis overthrow, who brought news' that his army by sea was\noverthrown, but that they thought the army by land was yet\nwhole. Then Antonius sent unto Canidius, to return with his\narmy into Asia by Macedon. Now for himself, he determined\nto cross over into Africa, and took one of his \n\n                   or hulks\n\n\n                   with gold and silver, and other rich \n\n                  , and gave\nit unto his friends, commanding them to depart, and seek to\nsave themselves. They answered him weeping, that they would\nneither do it, nor yet forsake him. Then Antonius very courteously\nand lovingly did comfort them, and prayed them to depart;\nand wrote unto Theophilus, governor of Corinth, that he\nwould see them safe, and help to hide them in some secret\nplace, until they had made their way and peace with Caesar.\nThis Theophilus was the father of Hipparchus, who was had in\ngreat estimation about Antonius. He was the first of all his\nenfranchised bondmen that revolted from him, and yielded unto\nCaesar, and afterwards went and dwelt at Corinth. \n\nAnd thus\nit stood with Antonius. Now \n\n                   his army by sea, that fought\nbefore the head or foreland of Actium, they held out a long \ntime, and nothing troubled them more than a great boisterous\nwind that rose full in the prows of their ships, and yet with\nmuch ado his navy was at length overthrown, five hours \n\n\n                  . There were not slain above five thousand men: but yet i\nthere were three hundred ships taken, as Octavius Caesar writeth\nhimself in his Commentaries. Many plainly saw Antonius\nfly, and yet could very hardly believe it, that he, that had nineteen\nlegions whole by land, and twelve thousand horsemen upon\nthe sea-side, would so have forsaken them, and have fled so\ncowardly, as it he had not oftentimes proved both the one and\n\n\n the other fortune, and that he had not been thoroughly acquainted\nwith the diverse changes and fortunes of battles. And\nyet his soldiers still wished for him, and ever hoped that he\nwould come by some means or other unto them. Furthermore,\nthey shewed themselves so valiant and faithful unto him, that\nafter they certainly knew he was fled, they kept themselves\nwhole together seven days.\n\n \n                  In the end Canidius, Antonius' lieutenant, flying by\nnight, and forsaking his camp, when they saw themselves thus\ndestitute of their heads and leaders, they yielded themselves\nunto the stronger. This done, Caesar sailed towards Athens,\nand there made peace with the Grecians, and divided the rest\nof the corn that was taken up for Antonius' army, unto the\ntowns and cities of Greece, the which had been brought to extreme\nmisery and poverty, \n                   without money, slaves, \n                  ,\nand other beasts of \n\n                  . So that my grandfather Nicarchus\ntold that all the citizens of our city of Chaeronea (not one\nexcepted) were driven themselves to carry a certain measure of\ncorn on their shoulders to the sea-side, that lieth directly over\nagainst the \n\n                   of Anticyra, and yet were they driven thither\nwith whips. They carried it thus but once: for the second\ntime that they were charged again to make the like carriage,\nall the corn being ready to be carried, news came that Antonius\nhad lost the battle, and so scaped our poor city. For Antonius'\nsoldiers and deputies fled immediately, and the citizens\ndivided the corn amongst them. \n\n                  Antonius being arrived in\nLybia, he sent Cleopatra before into Egypt from the city of\nParaetonium; and he himself remained very solitary, having\nonly two of his friends with him, with whom he wandered up\nand down, both of them orators, the one Aristocrates a Grecian,\nand the other Lucilius a Roman: of whom we have written in\nanother place, that, at the battle where Brutus was overthrown\nby the city of \n\n                  , he came and willingly put himself into\nthe hands of those that followed Brutus, saying that it was he:\nbecause Brutus in the meantime might have liberty to save\nhimself. And afterwards, because Antonius saved his life, he\nstill remained with him, and was very faithful and friendly unto\nhim till his death. But when Antonius heard that he whom he\nhad trusted with the government of Lybia, and unto whom he\nhad given the charge of his army there, had yielded unto Caesar,\nhe was so mad withal, that he would have slain himself for\nanger, had not his friends about him withstood him, and kept\n\n\nhim from it. So he went unto Alexandria, and there found\nCleopatra about a wonderful enterprise, and of great attempt.\nBetwixt the Red Sea and the sea between the lands that point\nupon the coast of Egypt, there is a little piece of land that divideth\nboth the seas, and separateth Africk from Asia: the\nwhich \n\n                   is so narrow at the end where the two seas are\nnarrowest, that it is not above three hundred furlongs over.\nCleopatra went \n\n                   to lift her ships out of the one sea, and\nto hale them over the bank into the other sea: that when her\nships were come into the gulf of Arabia, she might then carry\nall her gold and silver away, and so with a great company of\nmen go and dwell in some place about the Ocean Sea, far from\nthe sea Mediterraneum, to escape the danger and bondage of\nthis war. But now, because the Arabians dwelling about the\ncity of Petra, did burn the first ships that were brought to land,\nand that Antonius thought that his army by land which he left\nat Actium was yet whole, she left off her enterprise, and determined\nto \n\n                   all the ports and passages of her realm.\n\n \n                  Antonius, he forsook the city and company of his\nfriends, and built him a house in the sea by the \n\n                   of Pharos,\nupon certain forced mounts which he caused to be cast into the\nsea, and dwelt there as a man that banished himself from all\nmen's company: saying that he would lead Timon's life, because\nhe had the like wrong offered him, that was before offered unto\nTimon: and that for the unthankfulness of those he had done\ngood unto, and whom he took to be his friends, he was angry\nwith all men and would trust no man. \n\n\n                  This Timon was a citizen\nof Athens, that lived about the war of Peloponnesus, as appeareth\nby Plato and Aristophanes' comedies: in the which\nthey mocked him, calling him a viper and malicious man unto\nmankind, to shun all other men's companies but the company\nof young Alcibiades, a bold and insolent youth, whom he would\ngreatly feast and make much of, and kissed him very gladly.\nApemantus wondering at it, asked him the cause \n\n                   he meant\nto make so much of that young man alone, and to hate all\nothers: Timon answered him, \" I do it,\" said he, \"because I\nknow that one day he shall do great mischief unto the Athenians.\" \nThis Timon sometimes would have Apemantus in his\ncompany, because he was much like of his nature and conditions,\nand also followed him in manner of life. On a time when\nthey solemnly celebrated the feast called Choe at Athens (to\nwit, the feasts of the dead where they make sprinklings and\n\n\n sacrifices for the dead) and that they two then feasted together\nby themselves, Apemantus said unto the other: \" O, here is a\ntrim banquet, Timon!\" Timon answered again: \"Yea,\" said\nhe, \" so thou wert not here.\" It is reported of him also, that\nthis Timon on a time (the people being assembled in the marI;et-place about dispatch of some affairs) got up into the pulpit\nfor orations, where the orators commonly \n\n                   to speak unto the\npeople: and silence being made, every man listening to hear\nwhat he would say, because it was a wonder to see him in that\nplace, at length he began to speak in this manner: \" My lords\nof Athens, I have a little yard at my house where there groweth\na fig-tree, on the which many citizens have hanged themselves:\nand because I mean to make some building on the place, I\nthought good to let you all understand it, that, before the figtree\nbe cut down, if any of you be \n                  , you may there in\ntime go hang yourselves.\" He died in the city of Hales, and\nwas buried upon the sea-side. Now it chanced so, that the sea\ngetting in, it compassed his tomb round about, that no man\ncould come to it: and upon the same was written this epitaph:\n\nHere dies a wretched corse, of wretched soul \nbereft:\n\nSeek not my name: a plague consume you wicked wretches \nleft !\n\nIt is reported that Timon himself, when he lived, made this\nepitaph: for that which is commonly rehearsed was not his,\nbut made by the poet Callimachus:\n\nHere lie I, Timon, who alive all living men did \nhate:\n\nPass by and curse thy fill: but pass, and stay not here thy \n\n\n                  .\n\n\n\nMany other things could we tell you of this Timon, but this\nLittle shall suffice at this present.\n\n But now to return to Antonius again. Canidius himself\ncame to bring him news, that he had lost all his army by\nland at Actium: on the other side he was \n\n                   a]so, that\nHerodes king of \n\n                  , who had also certain legions and bands\nwith him, was revolted unto Caesar, and all the other kings in\nlike manner: so that, saving those that were about him, he had\nnone left him. All this notwithstanding did nothing trouble\nhim: and it seemed that he was contented to \n\n                   all his\nhope, and so to be rid of al] his cares and troubles. Thereupon\nhe left his solitary house he had built by the sea, which he called\n and Cleopatra received him into her royal palace.\nHe was no sooner come thither, but he straight set all the city\non rioting and banqueting again, and himself to liberality and\n\n\ngifts. He caused the son of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra to be\nenrolled (according to the manner of the Romans) amongst the\nnumber of young men: and gave Antyllus, his eldest son he had\nby Fulvia, the man's gown, the which was a plain gown without\n\n\n                   or \n\n                  , of purple.For these things, there was\nkept great feasting, banqueting and dancing in Alexandria many\ndays together. Indeed they did break their first order they had\nset down, which they called Amimetobion (as much to say, 'no\nlife comparable'), and did set up another, which they called\nSynapothanumenon (signifying the order and agreement of those\nthat will die together), the which in exceeding sumptuousness\nand cost was not inferior to the first. For their friends made\nthemselves to be enrolled in this order of those that would die\ntogether, and so made great feasts one to another: for every\nman, when it came to his turn, feasted their whole company and\nfraternity. Cleopatra in the meantime was very \n\n                   in gathering\nall sorts of poisons together, to destroy men. Now to\nmake proof of those poisons which made men die with least\npain, she tried it upon condemned men in prison. For when\nshe saw the poisons that were sudden and vehement, and\nbrought speedy death with grievous torments; and in contrary\nmanner, that such as were more mild and gentle had not that\nquick speed and force to make one die suddenly: she afterwards\nwent about to \n\n                   the stinging of snakes and adders, and\nmade some to be applied unto men in her sight, some in one\nsort, some in another. So when she had daily made divers and\nsundry proofs, she found none of them all she had proved so\nfit as the biting of an \n\n                  , the which causeth only a heaviness\nof the head, without swooning or complaining, and bringeth\na great desire also to sleep, with a little sweat in the face; and\nso by little and little taketh away the senses and vital powers,\nno living creature perceiving that the patients feel any pain.\nFor they are so sorry when any body awaketh them and taketh\nthem up, as those that be taken out of a sound sleep are very\nheavy and desirous to sleep\n\n\n                  \n                  This notwithstanding, they sent ambassadors unto Octavius\nCaesar in Asia, Cleopatra requesting the realm of Egypt\nfor their children, and Antonius praying that he might be suffered\nto live at Athens like a private man, if Caesar would not\nlet him remain in Egypt. And because they had no other men\nof estimation about them, for that some were fled, and those\nthat remained they did not greatly trust, they were enforced to\n\n\nsend Euphronius, the schoolmaster of their children. For Alexas\nLaodicean, who was brought into Antonius' house and favour \nby\nmeans of Timagenes, and afterwards was in greater credit with\nhim than any other Grecian (for that he had ever been one of\nCleopatra's ministers to win Antonius, and to overthrow all his\ngood determinations to use his wife Octavia well?: him Antonius\nhad sent unto Herodes king of \n\n                  , hoping still to keep him\nhis friend, that he should not revolt from him. But he remained\nthere, and betrayed Antonius. For where he should have kept\nHerodes from revolting from him, he persuaded him to turn to\nCaesar: and trusting king Herodes, he presumed to come in\nCaesar's presence. Howbeit Herodes did him no pleasure, for\nhe was presently taken prisoner, and sent in chains to his own\ncountry, and there by Caesar's commandment put to death.\nThus was Alexas, in Antonius' life-time, put to death for betraying\nof him. \n\nFurthermore, Caesar would not grant unto\nAntonius' requests: but for Cleopatra, he made her answer,\nthat he would deny her nothing reasonable, so that she would\neither put Antonius to death, or drive him out of her country.\nTherewithal he sent Thyreus one of his men unto her, a very\nwise and discreet man: who bringing letters of credit from a\nyoung lord unto a noble lady, and that besides greatly liked her\nbeauty, might easily by his eloquence have persuaded her. He\nwas longer in talk with her than any man else was, and the\nqueen herself also did him great honour: insomuch as he made\nAntonius jealous of him. Whereupon Antonius caused him to\nbe taken and well \n                   whipped, and so sent him unto\nCaesar: and bad him tell him, that he made him angry with\nhim, because he shewed himself proud and disdainful towards\nhim; and now specially, when he was easy to be angered, by\nreason of his present misery. \"To be short, if this \n\n                   thee,\"\nsaid he, \" thou hast Hipparchus, one of my enfranchised bondmen,\nwith thee: hang him if thou wilt, or whip him at thy\npleasure, that we may cry quittance.\" From henceforth Cleopatra,\nto clear herself of the suspicion he had of her, made more\nof him than ever she did. For first of all, \n\n                   she did\nsolemnize the day of her birth very meanly and sparingly, fit for\nher present misfortune, she now in contrary manner did keep it\nwith such solemnity, that she exceeded all measure of sumptuousness\nand magnificence: so that the guests that were bidden\nto the feasts, and came poor, went away rich. Now things passing\nthus, Agrippa by divers letters sent one after another unto Caesar,\n\n\nprayed him to return to Rome, because the affairs there did of\nnecessity require his person and presence. \n\n                  Thereupon he did\ndefer the war till the next year following: but when winter\nwas done, he returned again through Syria by the coast of Africa,\nto make wars against Antonius and his other captains. When\nthe city of Pelusium was taken, there ran a rumour in the city,\nthat Seleucus (by Cleopatra's consent) had surrendered the same.\nBut to clear herself that she did not, Cleopatra brought Seleucus'\nwife and children unto Antonius, to be revenged of them at his\npleasure. Furthermore, Cleopatra had long before made many\nsumptuous tombs and monuments, as well for excellency of\nworkmanship, as for height and greatness of building, \n\n                  \nhard to the temple of Isis. Thither she caused to be brought all \nthe treasure and precious things she had of the ancient kings\nher predecessors: as gold, silver, emeralds, pearls, ebony, ivory,\nand cinnamon, and besides all that, a marvellous number of\ntorches, faggots, and flax. So Octavius Caesar, being afraid to\nlose such a treasure and mass of riches, and that this woman\nfor spite would set it on fire and burn it every whit, he always\nsent some one or other unto her from him, to put her in good\ncomfort, whilst he in the meantime drew near the city with his\narmy. So Caesar came and pitched his camp hard by the city,\nin the place where they run and manage their horses. Antonius\nmade a sally upon him, and fought very valiantly, so that he\n\n\n                   Caesar's horsemen back, fighting with his men even into\ntheir camp. Then he came again to the palace, greatly boasting\nof this victory, and sweetly kissed Cleopatra, armed as he was\nwhen he came from the fight, recommending one of his men\nof arms unto her, that had valiantly fought in this skirmish\nCleopatra, to reward his manliness, gave him an armour and headpiece\nof \n\n                   gold: howbeit the man-at-arms, when he had,\nreceived this rich gift, stole away by night and went to Caesar. \n\nAntonius sent again to challenge Caesar to fight with him hand \nto hand. Caesar answered him, \" That he had many other ways \nto die than so.\" Then Antonius, seeing there was no way more\nhonourable for him to die than fighting valiantly, he determined\nto set up his \n\n                  , both by sea and land. So being at supper\n(as it is reported) he commanded his officers and household\nservants that waited on him at his board, that they should fill\nhis cups full, and make as much of him as they could: \"For,\"\nsaid he, \"you know not whether you shall do so much for me tomorrow\nor not, or whether you shall serve another master: and\n\n\n it may be you shall see me no more, but a dead body.\" This\nnotwithstanding, perceiving that his friends and men fell a-weeping\nto hear him say so, to \n\n                   that he had spoken, he added\nthis more unto it, 'that he would not lead them to battle, where\nhe thought not rather safely to return with victory, than valiantly\nto die with honour.' Furthermore, the selfsame night, within\na little of midnight, when all the city was quiet, full of fear and\nsorrow, thinking what would be the issue and end of this war, it\nis said that suddenly they heard a marvellous sweet harmony\nof sundry sorts of instruments of music, with the cry of a multitude\nof people, as they had been dancing, and had sung as they\nuse in Bacchus' feasts, with movings and turnings after the\nmanner of the Satyrs: and it seemed, that this dance went\nthrough the city unto the gate that opened to the enemies, and\nthat all the \n\n                  , that made this noise they heard, went out of\nthe city at that gate. Now such as in reason sought the depth\nof the interpretation of this wonder, thought that it was the\ngod unto whom Antonius bare singular devotion to counterfeit\nand resemble him, that did forsake them. \n\nThe next morning\nby break of day, he went to set those few footmen he had in\norder upon the hills adjoining unto the city: and there he stood\nto behold his galleys which departed from the haven, and rowed\nagainst the galleys of the enemies, and so stood still, looking\nwhat exploits his soldiers in them would do. But when by force\nof rowing they were come near unto them, they first saluted\nCaesar's men; and then Caesar's men resaluted them also, and\nof two armies made but one: and then did all together row\ntoward the city.\n\n \n                  When Antonius saw that his men did forsake him, and\nyielded unto Caesar, and that his footmen were broken and overthrown,\nhe then fled into the city, crying out that Cleopatra had\nbetrayed him unto them with whom he had made war for her\nsake. Then she, being afraid of his fury, fled into the tomb\nwhich he had caused to be made, and there she locked the\ndoors unto her, and shut all the springs of the locks with great\nbolts, and in the meantime sent unto Antonius to tell him that\nshe was dead. Antonius believing it, said unto himself: \"What\ndoest thou look for further, Antonius, \n\n                   spiteful fortune hath\ntaken from thee the only joy thou hadst, for whom thou yet\nreservedst thy life ?\" When he had said these words, he went\ninto a chamber and unarmed himself, and being \n\n                  , said\nthus: \"O Cleopatra, it grieveth me not that I have lost thy\n\n\ncompany, for I will not be long from thee: but I am sorry that,\nhaving been so great a captain and emperor, I am indeed condemned\nto be judged of less courage and noble mind than a\nwoman \" Now he had a man of his called Eros, whom he\nloved and trusted much, and whom he had long before caused\nto swear unto him, that he should kill him when he did command\nhim: and then he willed him to keep his promise. His\nman, drawing his sword, \n\n                   it up as though he had meant to\nhave stricken his master: but turning his head at one side, he\nthrust his sword into himself, and fell down dead at his master's\nfoot. Then said Antonius: \"O noble Eros, I thank thee for\nthis, and it is valiantly done of thee, to shew me what I should\ndo to myself, which thou couldest not do for me.\" Therewithal\nhe took his sword, and thrust it into his belly, and so fell down\nupon a little bed. The wound he had killed him not \n\n                  ,\nfor the blood \n\n                   a little when he was laid: and when he\ncame somewhat to himself again, he prayed them that were\nabout him to despatch him. But they all fled out of the chamber,\nand left him crying out, tormenting himself: until at last there\ncame a secretary unto him (called Diomedes) who was commanded\nto bring him into the tomb or monument where Cleopatra\nwas. \n\n                  When he heard that she was alive, he very earnestly\nprayed his men to carry his body thither, and so he was carried\nin his men's arms into the entry of the monument. Notwithstanding,\nCleopatra would not open the gates, but came to the\nhigh windows, and cast out certain chains and ropes, in the\nwhich Antonius was \n\n                  : and Cleopatra her own self, with\ntwo women only, which she had suffered to come with her\ninto these monuments, \n\n                   Antonius up. They that were\npresent to behold it said they never saw so pitiful a sight.\nFor they plucked up poor Antonius, all bloody as he was, and\ndrawing on with pangs of death: who holding up his hands to\nCleopatra, raised up himself as well as he could. It was a\nhard thing for these women to do, to lift him up: but Cleopatra,\nstooping down with her head, putting to all her strength to\nher uttermost power, did lift him up with much ado, and never\nlet go her hold, with the help of the women beneath that bad\nher be of good courage, and were as sorry to see her labour\nso as she herself. So when she had gotten him in after that\nsort, and laid him on a bed, she rent her garments upon him,\n\n\n                   her breast, and scratching her face and stomach.\nThen she dried up his blood that had \n\n                   his face, and\n\n\ncalled him her lord, her husband, and emperor, forgetting her\nown misery and calamity for the pity and compassion she took\nof him. Antonius made her cease her lamenting, and called\nfor wine, either because he was athirst, or else for that he\nthought thereby to hasten his death. When he had drunk, he\nearnestly prayed her, and persuaded her, that she would seek\nto save her life, if she could possible, without reproach and dishonour:\nand that chiefly she should trust Proculeius above any\nman else about Caesar. And as for himself, that she should\nnot lament nor sorrow for the miserable change of his fortune\nat the end of his days: but rather that she should think him\nthe more fortunate, for the former triumphs and honours he had\nreceived; considering that while he lived, he was the noblest\nand greatest prince of the world; and that now he was overcome,\nnot cowardly, but valiantly, a Roman by another Roman.\n\n\n\n                  As Antonius gave the last gasp, Proculeius came that was\nsent from Caesar. For after Antonius had thrust his sword in\nhimself, as they carried him into the tombs and monuments of\nCleopatra, one of his guard (called Dercetaeus) took his sword\nwith which he had stricken himself, and hid it: then he secretly\nstole away, and brought Octavius Caesar the first news of his\ndeath, and shewed him his sword that was \n\n                  . Caesar\nhearing this news, straight withdrew himself into a secret place\nof his tent, and there burst out with tears, lamenting his hard\nand miserable fortune, that had been his friend and brother-in-law, \nhis equal in the empire, and companion with him in\nsundry great exploits and battles. Then he called for all his\nfriends and shewed them the letters Antonius had written to\nhim, and his answers also sent him again, during their quarrel\nand strife: and now fiercely and proudly the other answered\nhim, to all just and reasonable matters he wrote unto him.\n\n \n                   After this, he sent Proculeius, and commanded him to\ndo what he could possible to get Cleopatra alive, fearing lest\notherwise all the treasure would be lost: and furthermore, he\nthought that if he could take Cleopatra, and bring her alive\nto Rome, she would marvellously beautify and set out his\ntriumph. But Cleopatra would never put herself into Proculeius'\nhands, although they spake together. For Proculeius\ncame to the gates that were thick and strong, and surely barred,\nbut yet there were some \n\n                   through the which her voice\nmight be heard; and so they without \n\n                  , that Cleopatra\ndemanded the kingdom of Egypt for her sons: and that \n\nProculeius answered her that she should be of good cheer, and not\nbe afraid to refer all unto Caesar. \n\nAfter he had viewed the place\nvery well, he came and reported her answer unto Caesar: who\nimmediately sent Gallus to speak once again with her, and bad\nhim purposely hold her in talk, whilst Proculeius did set up a\nladder against that high window by the which Antonius was\n\n\n                   up, and came down into the monument with two of his\nmen, hard by the gate where Cleopatra stood to hear what\nGallus said unto her. One of her women which was shut up in\nher monuments with her, saw Proculeius by chance as he came\ndown, and \n\n                   out: \"O poor Cleopatra, thou art taken.\"\nThen when she saw Proculeius behind her as she came from the\ngate, she thought to have stabbed herself in with a short dagger\nshe wore of purpose by her side. But Proculeius came suddenly\nupon her, and taking her by both the hands, said unto her:\n\"Cleopatra, first thou shalt do thyself great wrong, and secondly\nunto Caesar, to deprive him of the occasion and opportunity\nopenly to shew his bounty and mercy, and to give his enemies\ncause to accuse the most courteous and noble prince that ever\nwas, and to \n\n                   him, as though he were a cruel and merciless\nman, that were not to be trusted.\" So even as he spake\nthe word, he took her dagger from her, and shook her clothes\nfor fear of any poison hidden about her. Afterwards, Caesar sent\none of his infranchised men called Epaphroditus, whom he\n\n\n                   charged to look well unto her, and to beware in\nany case that she made not herself away: and for the rest, to\nuse her with all the courtesy possible. \n\n\n                  And for himself, he in\nthe meantime entered the city of Alexandria, and (as he went)\ntalked with the philosopher Arrius, and held him by the hand,\nto the end that his countrymen should reverence him the more,\nbecause they saw Caesar so highly esteem and honour him.\nThen he went into the show-place of exercises, and so up to\nhis chair of state which was prepared for him of a great height:\nand there, according to his commandment, all the people of\nAlexandria were assembled, who, quaking for fear, fell down on\ntheir knees before him and craved mercy. Caesar bad them all\nstand up, and told them openly that he forgave the people, and\npardoned the \n\n                   and offences they had committed against\nhim in this war: first, for the founder's sake of the same city,\nwhich was Alexander the Great: secondly, for the beauty of the\ncity, which he much esteemed and wondered at: thirdly, for the\nlove he bare unto his \n\n                    friend Arrius. Thus did Caesar\n\n\n honour Arrius, who craved pardon for himself and many others,\nand specially for Philostratus, the eloquentest man of all the\n\n\n                   and orators of his time,for present and sudden speech:\nhowbeit, he falsely named himself an Academic philosopher.\nTherefore Caesar, that hated his nature and conditions, would\nnot hear his suit. Thereupon he let his grey beard grow long,\nand followed Arrius step by step in a long mourning gown, still\nbuzzing in his ears this Greek verse:\n\n\n\nCaesar understanding this, not for the desire he had to deliver\nPhilostratus of his fear, but to rid Arrius of malice and envy\nthat might have fallen out against him, he pardoned him. \n\n                  Now\ntouching Antonius' sons, Antyllus, his eldest son by Fulvia, was\nslain, because his schoolmaster Theodorus did betray him unto\nthe soldiers, who \n\n                   off his head. And the villain took a\nprecious stone of great value from his neck, the which he did\nsew in his girdle, and afterwards denied that he had it: but it\nwas found about him, and so Caesar  \n\n                   for it. For\nCleopatra's children, they were very honourably \n\n                  , with their\ngovernors and train that waited on them. But for Caesarion,\nwho was said to be Julius Caesar's son, his mother Cleopatra\nhad sent him unto the Indians through Ethiopia, with a great\nsum of money. But one of his governors also, called Rhodon,\neven such another as Theodorus, persuaded him to return into\nhis country, and told him that Caesar sent for him to give him\nhis mother's kingdom. So, as Caesar was determining with himself\nwhat he should do, Arrius said unto him:\n\n\n\nalluding unto a certain verse of Homer, that saith:\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Therefore Caesar did put Caesarion to death, after the death of\nhis mother Cleopatra.\n\n \n                  Many princes, great kings, and captains, did crave Antonius'\nbody of Octavius Caesar, to give him honourable burial: but\nCaesar would never take it from Cleopatra, who did sumptuously\nand royally bury him with her own hands, whom Caesar suffered\nto take as much as she would to bestow upon his funerals. Now\nwas she altogether overcome with sorrow and passion of mind,\nfor she had knocked her breast so pitifully, that she \nhad \n                   it, and in divers places had raised ulcers and \n\n\n\ninflammations, so that she fell into a fever withal; whereof she was very\nglad, hoping thereby to have good \n\n                   to abstain from meat,\nand that so she might have died easily without any trouble.\nShe had a physician called Olympus, whom she made privy to\nher intent, to the end he should help to rid her out of her life:\nas Olympus writeth himself, who wrote a book of all these\nthings. But Caesar \n\n                   the matter by many conjectures\nhe had, and therefore did put her in fear, and threatened her to\nput her children to shameful death. With these threats, Cleopatra\nfor fear yielded straight, as she would have yielded unto\nstrokes: and afterwards suffered herself to be cured and dieted\nas they listed.\n\n\n                  \n                  Shortly after, Caesar came himself in person to see her,\nand to comfort her. Cleopatra, being laid upon a little low bed\nin poor estate (when she saw Caesar come into her chamber),\nsuddenly rose up, naked in her smock, and fell down at his feet\nmarvellously disfigured: both for that she had plucked her hair\nfrom her head, as also for that she had martyred all her face\nwith her nails; and besides, her voice was small and trembling,\nher eyes sunk into her head with continual \n\n                  ; and\nmoreover, they might see the \n\n                   part of her stomach torn\nin sunder. To be short, her body was not much better than\nher mind: yet her good grace and comeliness and the force of\nher beauty was not altogether defaced. But notwithstanding\nthis ugly and pitiful state of hers, yet she shewed herself within,\nby her outward looks and countenance. When Caesar had made\nher lie down again, and sat by her bedside, Cleopatra began to\nclear and excuse herself for that she had done, laying all to the\nfear she had of Antonius: Caesar, in contrary manner, reproved\nher in every point. Then she suddenly altered her speech, and\nprayed him to pardon her, as though she were afraid to die,\nand desirous to live. At length, she gave him a brief and\nmemorial of all the ready money and treasure she had. But by\nchance there stood one Seleucus by, one of her treasurers, who, \nto seem a good servant, came straight to Caesar to disprove \nCleopatra, that she had not set \n\n                   all, but kept many things \nback of purpose. Cleopatra was in such a rage with him, that \nshe flew upon him, and took him by the hair of the head, and \n\n\n                   him well\n                  . Caesar fell a-laughing and parted \nthe fray. \"Alas,\" said she, \"O Caesar: is not this a great \nshame and reproach, that thou having vouchsafed to take the \npains to come unto me, and done me this honour, poor wretch \n\n\n and \n\n                   creature, brought into this pitiful and miserable\nstate: and that mine own servants should come now to accuse\nme? though it may be I have reserved some jewels and trifles\nmeet for women, but not for me (poor soul) to set out myself\nwithal, but meaning to give some pretty presents and gifts\nunto Octavia and Livia, that they, making means and intercession\nfor me to thee, thou mightest yet extend thy favour and\nmercy upon me.\" Caesar was glad to hear her say so, persuading\nhimself thereby that she had vet a desire to save her\nlife. So he made her answer, that he did not only give her that\nto dispose of at her pleasure which she had kept back, but\nfurther promised to use her more honourably and bountifully\nthan she would think for: and so he took his leave of her,\nsupposing he had deceived her, but indeed he was deceived\nhimself. \n\nThere was a young gentleman, Cornelius Dolabella,\nthat was one of Caesar's very great familiars, and besides did\nbear no ill will unto Cleopatra. He sent her word secretly (as\nshe had requested him) that Caesar determined to take his\njourney through Syria, and that within three days he would\nsend her away before with her children. When this was told\nCleopatra, she requested Caesar that it would please him to\nsuffer her to offer the last oblations of the dead unto the soul of\nAntonius. This being granted her, she was carried to the place\nwhere his tomb was, and there falling down on her knees, embracing\nthe tomb with her women, the tears running down her\ncheeks, she began to speak in this sort: \"O my dear lord\nAntonius, it is not long \n\n                   I buried thee here, being a\nfree woman: and now I offer unto thee the funeral sprinklings\nand oblations, being a captive and prisoner; and yet I am\nforbidden and kept from tearing and murdering this captive\nbody of mine with blows, which they carefully guard and keep\nonly to triumph of thee: look therefore henceforth for no other\nhonours, offerings, nor sacrifices from me: for these are the last\nwhich Cleopatra can give thee, \n\n                   now they carry her away.\nWhilst we lived together, nothing could sever our companies:\nbut now, at our death, I fear me they will make us change our\ncountries For as thou, being a Roman, hast been buried in\nEgypt: even so, wretched creature, I, an Egyptian, shall be\nburied in Italy, which shall be all the good that I have received\nby thy country If therefore the gods where thou art now have any\npower and authority, \n\n                   our gods here have forsaken us, suffer\nnot thy true friend and lover to be carried away alive, that in\n\n\nme they triumph of thee: but receive me with thee, and let me\nbe buried in one \n\n                   tomb with thee. For though my griefs\nand miseries be infinite, yet none hath grieved me more, nor\nthat I could less bear withal, than this small time which I have\nbeen driven to live alone without thee.\"\n\n\n                   Then having ended these doleful plaints, and crowned\nthe tomb with garlands and sundry nosegays, and marvellous\nlovingly embraced the same, she commanded they should prepare\nher bath; and when she had bathed and washed herself,\nshe fell to her meat, and was sumptuously served. Now whilst\nshe was at dinner, there came a countryman and brought her a\nbasket. The soldiers that \n\n                    at the gates, asked him\nstraight what he had in his basket. He opened his basket, and\ntook out the leaves that covered the figs, and shewed them that\nthey were figs he brought. They all of them marvelled to see\nso goodly figs. The countryman laughed to hear them, and\nbade them take some if they would. They believed he told\nthem truly, and so bade him carry them in. After Cleopatra\nhad dined, she sent a certain \n\n                   written and sealed unto\nCaesar, and commanded them all to go out of the tombs where\nshe was, but the two women; then she shut the doors to her.\nCaesar, when he had received this table, and began to read her\nlamentation and petition, requesting him that he would let her\nbe buried with Antonius, found straight what she meant, and\nthought to have gone thither himself: howbeit, he sent one\nbefore in all haste that might be, to see what it was. Her death\nwas very sudden: for those whom Caesar sent unto her ran\nthither in all haste possible, and found the soldiers standing at\nthe gate, \n\n                   nothing, nor understanding of her death.\nBut when they had opened the doors, they found Cleopatra\nstark-dead, laid upon a bed of gold, attired and arrayed in her\nroyal robes, and one of her two women, which was called Iras,\ndead at her feet: and her other woman (called Charmion) half\ndead, and trembling, trimming the diadem which Cleopatra\nwore upon her head. One of the soldiers seeing her, angrily\nsaid unto her: \"Is that well done, Charmion?\" \"Very well,\"\nsaid she again, \"and meet for a princess descended from the\nrace of so many noble kings :\" she said no more, but fell down\ndead hard by the bed. \n\nSome report that this \n\n                   was\nbrought unto her in the basket with figs, and that she had commanded\nthem to hide it under the fig-leaves, that when she\nshould think to take out the figs, the aspick should bite her\n\n\n before she should see her: howbeit, that when she would have\ntaken away the leaves for the figs, she perceived it, and said,\n\"Art thou here, then?\" And so, her arm being naked, she put\nit to the aspick to be bitten. Others say again, she kept it in a\nbox, and that she did prick and thrust it with a spindle of gold,\nso that the aspick, being angered withal, leapt out with great\nfury, and bit her in the arm. Howbeit few can tell the \n\n                  .\nFor they report also, that she had hidden poison in a hollow\nrazor which she carried in the hair of her head; and yet was\nthere no mark seen on her body, or any sign discerned that she\nwas poisoned, neither also did they kind this serpent in her\ntomb: but it was reported only, that there was seen certain\nfresh steps or tracks where it had gone, on the tomb-side toward\nthe sea, and specially by the door-side. Some say also that\nthey found two little \n\n                   bitings in her arm, \n\n                   to be\ndiscerned: the which it seemeth Caesar himself gave credit unto,\nbecause in his triumph he carried Cleopatra's image, with an\naspick biting of her arm. And thus goeth the report of her\ndeath. Now Caesar, though he was marvellous sorry for the\ndeath of Cleopatra, yet he wondered at her noble mind and\ncourage, and therefore commanded she should be nobly\nburied, and laid by Antonius: and willed also that her two\nwomen should have honourable burial.\n\n \n                  Cleopatra died being eight and thirty years old, after\nshe had reigned two and twenty years, and governed about\nfourteen of them with Antonius. And for Antonius, some say\nthat he lived three and fifty years: and others say, six and fifty.\nAll his statues, images, and metals, were plucked down and\noverthrown, saving those of Cleopatra, which stood still in their\nplaces, by means of Archibius one of her friends, who gave\nCaesar a thousand talents that they should not be handled as\nthose of Antonius were. \n\nAntonius left seven children by three\nwives, of the which Caesar did put Antyllus (the eldest son he\nhad by Fulvia) to death. Octavia his wife took all the rest, and\nbrought them up with hers, and married Cleopatra, Antonius'\ndaughter, unto king Juba, a marvellous courteous and goodly\nprince. And Antonius (the son of Fulvia) came to be so great,\nthat next unto Agrippa, who was in greatest estimation about\nCaesar, and next unto the children of Livia, which were the\nsecond in estimation, he had the third place. Furthermore,\nOctavia having had two daughters by her first husband Marcellus,\nand a son also called Marcellus, Caesar married his daughter\n\n\nunto that Marcellus, and so did adopt him for his son. And\nOctavia also married one of her daughters unto Agrippa. But\nwhen Marcellus was dead, after he had been married a while,\nOctavia, perceiving that her brother Caesar was very busy to\nchoose some one among his friends, whom he trusted best, to\nmake his son-in-law, she persuaded him that Agrippa should\nmarry his daughter (Marcellus' widow), and leave her own\ndaughter. Caesar first was contented withal, and then Agrippa:\nand so she afterwards took away her daughter and married her\nunto Antonius; and Agrippa married Julia, Caesar's daughter.\nNow there remained two daughters more of Octavia and Antonius:\nDomitius Aenobarbus married the one; and the other,\nwhich was Antonia, so fair and virtuous a young lady, was\nmarried unto Drusus, the son of Livia, and son-in-law of Caesar.\nOf this marriage came Germanicus and \n\n                  : of the which,\nClodius afterwards came to be emperor. And of the sons of\nGermanicus, the one whose name was \n\n                   came also to be\nemperor: who after he had licentiously reigned a time, was\nslain, with his wife and daughter. Agrippina also (having a son\nby her first husband Aenobarbus, called Lucius Domitius) was\nafterwards married unto Clodius, who adopted her son, and\ncalled him Nero Germanicus. This Nero was emperor in our\ntime, who slew his own mother, and had almost destroyed the\nempire of Rome through his madness and wicked life, being the\nfifth emperor of Rome after Antonius."}}}, {"@n": "Oct.", "front": {"div": [{"@type": "toc", "pb": {"@n": "230"}, "head": "The Life of Octavius Caesar Augustus", "list": {"@type": "simple", "item": [{"ref": {"@n": "para. 1", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "1.

the ancient\nrace of the Octavians, issued out of the country of the\nVolsces, and known at Rome from the time of Tarquinius, and\nof Servius Tullus. Their son Octavius was born in the year of\nthe consulship of Cicero and of Caius Antonius, \n                   the conspiracy \nof Catiline was discovered and suppressed.\nHe was called Thurinus: but afterwards, according to\nthe tenor of his uncle's testament, who made him his heir, he\nwas called Caius Julius Caesar, and lastly Augustus, by the advice \n\n\nof Munatius Plancus, and by the decree of the Senate. He\nwas but four years old when his father died, and at twelve years\nhe made the funeral oration for his grandmother Julia: four years\nafter that, he became a gownman, though he were but young:\nyet his uncle gave him a present at his return out of Africa,\nsuch as the soldiers are accustomed to have of their captains.\nShortly after he followed his uncle into Spain, whither he was\ngone against the children of Pompey, and passed through many\ngreat dangers to overtake him. This war being ended, because\nCaesar undertook other longer journeys, Octavius was sent into\nthe city of Apollonia:\nand there \n                   his book very diligently.\nAnd it chanced him, without having any mind to it, that, being\ngone to see Theogenes a learned astronomer, he cast his nativity;\nand suddenly he leapt, being amazed, and honoured him.\nThe which made Octavius conceive great hope of himself, and\nin memory of this good hap he caused certain pieces of money\nto be coined, and he himself told the opinion of Theogenes.\nBeing returned from Apollonia to Rome, after his uncle was\nslain by Cassius, Brutus, and their allies, he declared himself to\nbe his heir, \nthough his mother and Marcius Philippus were of\nanother mind. \nAnd having put himself forward, he governed\nthe commonwealth of Rome, first with Antonius and Lepidus,\nafterwards with Antonius, the space of twelve years: and lastly\nhimself alone, the space of four and forty years. But before we\nspeak of his government of common affairs in time of peace and\nwar, let us say somewhat (after Suetonius) of his family and his\nmanners. He married being yet very young the daughter of\nPublius Servilius Isauricus: but having made peace with Antonius\nafter the war of ,\nand at the request of their armies,\nwho were desirous to see them friends, he married with Clodia,\nthe daughter of Publius Clodius and of Fulvia then wife of Antonius.\nBut before he knew her, he sent her to her mother,\nwith whom he was somewhat discontented, and because of the\nwar of \n                  \nImmediately he married Scribonia, and kept\nnot her long, because she was too troublesome: yet he had a\ndaughter by her called Julia.\n\nBut forsaking her, he took another\nwhich he loved unto the end: and that was Livia Drusilla,\nthe wife of Tiberius Nero, whom he carried with him great with\nchild as she was, and had no more children by her but one, and\nyet she went not out her time, and it had no life. His daughter\nJulia was married unto Marcellus, the son of his sister Octavia:\nand after his death unto Marcus Agrippa, by whom she had\n\n\nthree sons, Caius, Lucius, and Agrippa: and two daughters,\nJulia and \n                   \nAfter the death of Marcus Agrippa, he\nchose for his son-in-law Tiberius, the son of Tiberius Nero and\nLivia Drusilla, at that time a knight of Rome, and compelled\nhim to forsake his wife Vipsamia, of whom he had a son called\nDrusus.\nBut as he was fortunate in managing the affairs of the\ncommonwealth, so was he unfortunate in his race: for his\ndaughter and his niece Julia committed so foul faults in Rome,\nthat he was constrained to banish them. Agrippine1 was married\nunto Germanicus, the son of his sister's daughter. Caius\nand Lucius died in less than a year and a half one after\nanother: whereupon he adopted his nephew Agrippa, and his\nson-in-law Tiberius. But because Agrippa was of a churlish\nnature and \n                  \nhe did disinherit him, and confined him\nto Surrentum. His niece Julia had a child after she was\nbanished, but he would not know it, nor suffer it should be\nbrought up.\n\n\n                  \n                  \nHe was very modest and continent in all the parts of his\nlife, saving that he was somewhat given to women and play: for\nthe rest, he liked not great palaces, but was contented with\nmean lodgings: and if there were any ornament, it was in\nporches and parks. His household-stuff and apparel was \n                  \nsumptuous nor costly. It pleased him well to make feasts; he\nvery carefully made choice of his guests, and oftentimes he sat\ndown at the table a long time after everybody, and would rise\nbefore others, which remained after he was up. In his ordinary\ndiet he banished superfluity of meats, he delighted to be merry\nand pleasant among his friends, or to bring in pleasant players\nof comedies to pass the time away. And he did not tie himself\nto any certain hours to eat his meat, but when his stomach\nserved him he took something. So that sometimes he supped\nnot at all, and then, when every man was gone, he made them\nbring him meat, neither dainty nor delicate. Also he \n                  \nvery little wine; he slept in the day, and by times in the night,\ntalking with some or reading: so that oftentimes he slept not till\nthe break of day, and, for that he took no rest in the night, he\nmight chance to sleep in his litter as they carried him in the\nstreets in the daytime up and down in Rome. He was a goodly\nprince, and that kept himself in good state from the beginning\nof his life to the latter end: not curious to set himself out, as\nlittle caring to be shaven as to wear long hair: and instead of a\nlooking-glass, reading in his book or writing, even whilst the\n\n\nbarber was trimming of him. Whether he spake or held his\npeace, he had so comely a face, that many of his enemies, bent\nto do him hurt, their hearts would not serve them so soon as ever\nthey looked on him. He had very clear and lively eyes, but\nwith \n                  \nhe was subject to many diseases and infirmities, the\nwhich he remedied with great care. \nAs for his exercises, he left arms and horses immediately after the civil wars: for he was\nnever any great soldier. He would play at tennis, at the \n                  \nhe would go abroad in his coach to walk and stir himself.\nSometimes he would go a-fishing, or play at the bones, or at\nnuts, with young children of the Moors and Syrians that had\nsome pretty manner and behaviour with them, and always spake\nwords to move laughter. He was learned in the liberal sciences,\nvery eloquent, and desirous to learn: insomuch that during the\nwar of \n                  \nin the midst of all his infinite affairs, he did read,\nhe wrote, and made orations amongst his familiars. He never\nspake unto the Senate nor people, nor to his soldiers, but he\nhad first written and premeditated that he would say unto them,\nalthough he had speech at commandment, to propound or answer\nto anything in the field. And because he would not deceive his\nmemory, or lose time in superfluous speech, he determined ever\nto write all that he would say: and he was the first inventor of\nit. If he had to confer with any man, or with his wife in any\nmatters of importance, he would put that down in his writing tables,\nbecause he would speak neither more nor less. And he\ntook pleasure to pronounce his words with a sweet voice and\ngood grace, having continually about him for this purpose a fine\nman to frame his voice. But one day having a pain in his\nmouth, he made his oration to the people by an herald. He\nmade many books and verses of divers sorts; but all is dead\nwith the time. His speech was as the rest of his life, eloquent,\nwell couched together, and sententious. He delighted to read\ngood authors, but he gathered nothing other than the sentences\nteaching good manners: and having written them out word by\nword, he gave out a copy of them to his familiars: and sent\nthem about to the governors of provinces, and to the magistrates\nof Rome and of other cities. He was somewhat, and too\nmuch, given to divinations; he was marvellously afraid of thunder\nand lightning; he had a great confidence in dreams, and in\nsuch like vanities. But peradventure we are too curious searching\nout his private life: yet that may sometime discover great\npersonages more than their public actions, in the which they are\n\n\nmore careful to frame their countenances, and do counterfeit\nmost.\n\n\n                   \n                  \nNow, as we have lightly run over his private life before\nspoken of, so shall the memorable deeds done by his authority\nbe briefly represented: being \n                  \nto comprehend in a few lines so many notable things, unless a man would make a great\nbook of them. This is to be noted in him, that so young a man,\nhaving so small beginnings, coming out of a mean house in\ncomparison of others, hath exceed all other young and old men\nin wisdom and greatness of courage; should rise so high, that\nbefore he had been praetor the Senate gave him the name of Augustus,\ncreated him master of the horse, when as yet he never\nhad charge of a company of men-at-arms: proclaimed him emperor\nand sovereign captain, \n                  \nhe had been placed in any public office by authority of the Senate. Furthermore, for the\nfirst time he was chosen consul when he was but twenty years\nold: and he was thirteen times consul, and twenty times called\nsovereign captain. Afterwards, when he was not yet four and\nthirty years old, the Senate and people of Rome gave him this\ngoodly name of father of his country, because he had maintained\nand preserved the commonwealth. It is a wonderful\nthing that he could wind himself out of so many great affairs\nand wars, that he could, within four and twenty years of age,\nrestore again into so good estate the commonwealth of Rome,\nturmoiled and troubled with so many proscriptions and civil\nwars as it was. And that afterwards, so long as he commanded\nalone, he did so firmly establish this monarchy, that notwithstanding\nthe infinite troubles received under other emperors, yet\nit stood upright and in so great prosperity for so many hundred\nyears. After the death of Julius Caesar, this man, being but\nbare eighteen years old, came to Rome, where he was welcomed,\nand immediately did contest with Antonius, hated of Cicero\nand of many others: from whence the advancement of this\nyoung Caesar came, and the declaration of the war against Antonius,\njudged an enemy of the commonwealth, and overcome\nby the consuls Hirtius and Pansa. Caesar, who was their associate,\nwas called sovereign captain, though he had not yet\nfought: both the consuls being dead of their hurts. But the\nSenate, after this overthrow, beginning to change their mind, he,\nperceiving that they were slow to grant him the consulship,\nresolved to possess it by force of arms, and began to acquaint\nhimself with Antonius and Lepidus, which were joined together.\n\n\nHe made that the soldiers promised by oath the one to the\nother, that they would fight against none of Caesar's \n                  \nand sent 400 men to Rome to ask for him, in the name of all\nthe army, the office of consul. They having delivered their\ncharge unto the Senate, Cornelius the \n                   chief of this legation\nor ambassade, perceiving they would give him no present\nanswer, casting up his cassock and strewing the Senate the pommel\nof his sword, said unto them: \"This shall do it, if you will\nnot do it.\" So they being returned without obtaining their demand,\nCaesar made Antonius and Lepidus come into Italy, and\nhe for his part having passed the river of Rubicon, marched\nwith eight legions right to Rome.\n\nThis put all Rome in such a fear, as they sent to Caesar to present him the consulship: and\ntwice so much in gift as they had promised the legions. Now\nwhilst the ambassadors were on their way, the senators beginning\nagain to take heart to them, encouraged by the arrival of\nthe legions of Africa, they determined to try all means before\nthey would betray the liberty of their country, being minded to\ncall back that which they had sent to Caesar, and so disposed\nthemselves to make war. Caesar, being offended with this inconstancy,\nsent certain horsemen before to assure the people that\nhe would make no tumult at all: he drew his legions near, and\nmade himself lord of Rome without one stroke stricken: and\ncontrariwise, the people and Senate received him with shew\nof great joy. Then, in the assembly of all the people, he was\nchosen consul, just at the full accomplishment of twenty years of\nhis age. So he demanded in the field that they should proceed\ncriminally against those that had killed his father Caesar.\nQ. Pedius, his fellow-consul, published the decree. So were\nBrutus and Cassius and all their friends condemned, with interdiction\nof water and fire. But forasmuch as Augustus had too\nsmall means to set upon Brutus and Cassius, he reconciled Antonius\nand Lepidus with the Senate, and made alliance with\nthem, followed with great armies. They joined, and were in\nconsultation of their affairs the space of three days together,\nnear unto Bolonia, or unto \n                   and as if the Roman empire\nhad been their own inheritance, they divided it between them\nthree. So that Caesar had the high and \n                   Lybia, with Sicilia\nand Sardinia. Spain and Gaul Narbonense fell unto Lepidus:\nand the rest of Gaul was for Antonius.\n\nThey did decree also that they should be called Triumviri, appointed for the re-establishment\nof the commonwealth, with sovereign authority for\n\n\nfive years, to dispose and give the estates and offices to whom\nthey thought good, without asking advice of the Senate or\npeople. So they established Lepidus consul for the year following,\nin the place of Decimus Brutus that was killed: and they\ngave him the guard of Rome and Italy, so long as they two that\nremained made their preparations to go against Brutus and\nCassius. Besides the presents they should make unto the soldiers\nafter the victory, they promised to give them leave to ease\nthemselves, and eighteen rich towns in Italy for them to dwell\nin. Then they began to \n                   a roll of all the citizens of\nRome appointed by them to be slain. And they decreed to\nevery free man that should bring the Triumviri a head of the\nproscripts, the sum of two thousand five hundred crowns, and\nhalf so much unto the slaves with enfranchisement: and the\nlike sum also to whosoever could discover any man that had\nhidden or favoured the proscripts. Antonius and Lepidus were\nthought to be the chief authors of this horrible tragedy; and\nCaesar \n                   \nto none but to the \n                   of his\nfather, and did a long time oppose himself against the other\ntwo: but at the length he gave over, and they made wonderful\nchanges, abandoning their own parents and friends the one to\nthe other, to be revenged of their enemies. But when the sword\nwas once drawn, he was no less cruel than the other two.\nCicero was not forgotten, as we may see in his life: and it\nwould be very hard to describe the wickedness of that time,\nthe which like a furious stream carried away so many citizens of\nRome. In whose history do appear most rare examples of all\nsorts of vices and virtues in all manner of persons; of whom\nwe will make mention, after those that have written more at\nlarge: as amongst others, Appianus Alexandrinus: which will\nserve to shew, how much a man is a furious beast, \n                   up in authority in the commonwealth, and given to revenge.\nThat\nthere is nothing certain nor sure in man's prosperity, which\nbringeth much envy to his servants: as to the contrary,\nadversity maketh the afflicted contemptible, and everybody\nashamed of them. But they are wise men that in such tragical\naccidents do carry an invincible heart, resolutely obeying necessity\nand a more high providence than that of man. We must\nnot call that intolerable which may happen to great or mean\nmen: for all human accidents are under the feet of Virtue. It\nchanceth often that force and wisdom do defend a man, as\nalways these two virtues do preserve his honour. He is well\n\n\nadvised that can finely pacify and divert the fury of an enemy:\nas to the contrary, shame and despair do \n                  cowards, slothful,\nand fearful. But in fine, necessity presseth on the one\nside, and danger on the other.\n\n\n                   \n                  \nSo they did set up the names of the proscripts fastened\nin divers places of Rome, to the number of an hundred and\nthirty senators for the first time, a hundred and fifty at the\nsecond time, and two thousand knights. Then was the gate\nopen to all villanies and cruelties, fought withal by patience and\nfidelity: but the examples will shew that better than all the discourse\na man can make. Salvius Otho, tribune of the people,\nwas one of the first: who having invited his friends to his last\nsupper, a \n                   came in, and in the presence of all his guests,\nhalf dead for fear, \n                   off his head. Minutius the praetor\nwas also killed, sitting in his seat of judgment. L. Villius Annalis,\na man that had been consul, being escaped out of the\nhands of the murtherers, saved himself in the suburbs in a little\nhouse of one of his clients: but his own son, having no patience\nto stay for the inheritance of his father, \n                   him unto\nthe soldiers, who went to kill him there. \nShortly after this parricide, being drunk, had a quarrel with the self-same soldiers,\nwho \n                  \nwith their daggers. C. Toranius was betrayed\nin like manner by his own son, who having consumed in\na few days the succession which he had so execrably pursued,\nand being condemned for theft, was banished into a place\nwhere he died for want and poverty. \nNow against these wicked,let us set some virtuous children. Q. Cicero was hid by his\nson, whom they could never make confess (though he was tormented) \nwhere his father was: who, not able any longer to endure\nthey should afflict so virtuous a son with so many evils for\nhis sake, came and presented himself to the murtherers. The\nson began to intreat them to kill him before his father: but they\nwere both killed at one time. The Egnaces, father and son,\none embracing the other, were both run through and slain at\none blow. C. Hosidius Geta was buried for dead by his son:\nwho saved him, sustained, and kept him till it was peace. Arruntius,\nafter he had comforted and strengthened his son, put\nhimself to the swords of the murtherers. The son died immediately\nafter for grief and famine. Some other children carefully\nsaved and kept their fathers, and hid them.\n\nCertain women also shewed themselves marvellous faithful and loving\nto their husbands: and so were there, to the contrary, some\n\n\nunfaithful, that discovered their wonderful wickedness. Tanusia\nmade such earnest suit, that she obtained grace of Caesar for\nT. Junius her husband, who was hidden by Philopoemen, his\nbondman enfranchised; whom Caesar knighted for his fidelity to\nhis master. Q. Ligarius, having been kept by his wife, was discovered\nby a slave, and killed: wherefore his wife killed herself\nwith famine. Lucretius Vespillo, having \n                   and run in great\ndanger here and there, not knowing whither to fly, came secretly\nto his wife Thuria, and was hidden and kept close betwixt\nthe \n                   and the top of the house, until she had obtained his\ngrace of the Triumviri. Apuleius was saved by his wife, who\nfled with him. The wife of Antius wrapped up her husband in\ncoverlets, and made him be carried to the sea as a packet of\nstuff, where he \n                   and sailed into Sicilia. Coponius was\nsaved by his wife, who put her honour aside in respect of her\nhusband's life: for she lent her body one night unto Antonius to\npreserve him (which she did by that means) whom she loved\nbetter than herself. Now to the contrary, some women, unfaithful\nto their husbands, delivered them into the hands of the murtherers,\nbecause they might marry again. Amongst other, the\nwife of Septimius, having shamefully given her body unto one of\nAntonius' familiars, she caused her husband to be put in the\nnumber of the proscripts, that she might more easily continue\nher adultery: and so was Septimius put to death. Q. Vettius\nSalassus was hidden in a sure privy place, wherewith he acquainted\nhis wife; but she straight revealed him to the murtherers.\nThe which he perceiving, from a high place where he\nwas, cast himself down headlong, choosing rather to die so,\nthan to make his cruel wife pastime. Fulvius was discovered\nby a slave of his and his concubine, jealous because he had\nmarried a wife, and had left her; although notwithstanding he\nhad made her free, and had given her goods to live withal.\n\nNow let us presently speak of the faithfulness and unfaithfulness\nof slaves enfranchised. P. Naso was betrayed by his slave\nfreed, with whom he had been too familiar. But he sold his\ndeath, for he killed the traitor with his own hands, and afterwards\nheld out his neck to the hangman. L. Lucceius had put\ninto the hands of two of his slaves \n                  \nas much as was necessary to have relieved him in his banishment: but they\nran away with all, and he came and put himself to the slaughter.\nHaterius, that was in a secret place, was sold and discovered\nby a slave of his. Cassius Varus, being bewrayed by a freeman\n\n\nthat was his slave, escaped nevertheless, and hid himself among\nreeds: where being found by those of \n                  \nthey took him for a thief, and would have racked him to have\n\n                  \nhis companions: he discovered himself to be a senator of Rome,\nbut they would not believe him, because he was in poor estate.\nBut whilst they were reasoning of the matter, there cometh a\n\n                  \n                  \n                  \noff his head. C. Plotius was saved by his\nslaves: but being a man given to perfume and rub himself with\nodoriferous ointments, the \n                   and smell of them discovered\nhim to the soldiers, that went \n                   up and down in his\nhouse: yet could they not find him, but cruelly tormented his\nservants, to make them confess where he was: which they would\nnever do. But Plotius, having compassion of the evils of his\nfaithful slaves, came out of the place where he was hidden; and\nbecause he would prolong their life, he shortened his own, and\npresented himself to the murtherers. Appius Claudius, as he\nwas near to be had by the back, changed his gown with his\nslave, who went in that sort to present himself to the murtherers:\nbut they took off his head, and so he saved his master's\nhead. \nAnother slave of Menenius did the like: for he went\ninto his master's litter, and offered his neck to the sword of the\nmurtherers: who despatched him whilst his master got to the\nport of the sea, from whence he escaped into Sicilia. But the\nslave of Urbinus Panopio is worthy of memory everywhere: for\nhe, hearing the murtherers came to \n                   his master, took his\nmaster's gown from him and his ring, gave him his own, and\nput him out at the back-gate. Then he goeth up into his master's\nchamber, and lay down upon his bed, where he boldly\n\n                   them, that killed him for Panopio. Another shewed\nhimself no less faithful in the behalf of Antius Restio: for although\nhis master had throughly thwacked him for his knavish\ntricks played a few days before, and that then it seemeth he\nhad opportunity to be revenged; he to the contrary employed\nhimself after a marvellous fashion to save his master: for he,\nmeeting with an old man in his journey, \n                   off his head;\nand strewing that, with his whippings together, to the murtherers,\nhe made them easily believe that he had been well revenged\nof his master, with whom immediately after he saved himself in\nSicilia. The slaves of Martius Censorinus kept him a long\ntime, and so well, that he had leisure to go to Sextus Pompeius.\nQ. Oppius, an honourable old man, and being almost at the pit's\nbrink, like to be killed, was rescued by his son, who having\n\n\n                  \n                   gotten him out of Rome, took him upon his shoulders,\nand afterwards led him into Sicilia, where all the poor distressed\nRomans were gently received. \nFor Pompeius had sent certain ships to keep upon the coast of Italy, and pinnaces everywhere,\nto the end to receive all them that fled on that side; giving\nthem double recompence that saved a proscript, and honourable\noffices to men that had been consuls and escaped, comforting\nand entertaining the others with a most singular courtesy.\nMany went into Macedon to Brutus and Cassius: others into\nAfrica to Cornificius. Some, having escaped the tempest that\nwas in the time of Sylla, were even glutted with this cruelty: as\namongst others, M. Fidustius, and Lucius Philuscius. T. Labienus\nwas one of the number of the murtherers in the proscription\nof Sylla. \nAfterwards he did nothing else but go up and\ndown with a soul possessed with furies: so that, being weary of\nhis life at this time, he went and sat in a chair at his gate,\nquietly \n                   that they should put him in the number of\nthem that should be killed. Statius Samnis, an honourable\nsenator, being fourscore years old, because thieves should have\nno part of his goods, he left them in prey to whosoever would\ntake them: and afterwards set his house on fire, and burnt\nhimself within it. Aponius, being kept a good while by his\nslaves, was so weary to be shut up in a troublesome place, and\nwhere he lived very poorly, that he came out to the marketplace,\nand held out his throat to the murtherers. Cestius, being\npossessed with the like grief, caused his slaves to make a great\nfire, and then cast himself in it. Sulpitius Rufus, a man that\nhad been consul, died because of an \n                   of his the which he\nwould not sell unto Fulvia: as also Ampius Balbus, for that\nhe refused to give this woman a pleasant place of his. Balbus\nwas betrayed by a servant of his, that shortly after was hanged\nupon a gibbet by sentence of the people, and so had his reward\nfor his villanous \n                   Antonius did put in the number\nof proscripts a senator called Nonius Struma, and only to get\nout of his hands an \n                   esteemed at fifty thousand crowns.\nBut Nonius found the means to escape with his emerod, to the\ngreat despite of him that greedily desired this prey. Some valiantly\ndefended themselves, as Atteius Capito, that killed many\nsoldiers running rudely upon him, thinking he would have suffered\nhimself to be killed as others were. Howbeit after he had\nsold his flesh dear, he was overcome by multitude of assailants.\nVetulinus, aided with his son, having many times valiantly \n\n\nrepulsed the murtherers, he would have saved himself in Sicilia:\nbut in the \n                   he met with such a number of enemies, that\nthere he was killed. Sicilius Coranas, a senator, was put in the\nnumber of proscripts, and because he would not with others\ncondemn Brutus and Cassius, devising how to escape, he put\nhimself in rank among those that carried a dead corpse to\nburial: but he was discovered and put to death. The Triumviri\nappointed such men as they \n                   of, to take charge of them\nthat had been killed. They sold the goods of the proscripts by\nthe drum, at such a price as the soldiers would: and yet the\nmost part of them were spoiled and given away. \n\nThey promised the widows their jointure, and to the sons the tenth part of the\npatrimony of their fathers, and to the daughters the twentieth\npart. Howbeit there were few, and in manner none, that had\nany benefit by that: but to the contrary, they\n\n                   many \nthat demanded such rights. On the other side, they did exact great\nsums of money upon the city of Rome, and over all Italy: the\nowners were constrained to give the half of their yearly revenue:\nthe tenants to furnish one year's rent of that they held of others:\nthe masters of houses, the half of the rent of their houses, according\nto the rent they went for. To encourage the soldiers,\nthe Triumviri gave \n                  \ngifts, granted them daily new pillage: the legions wintered in the richest towns, who were\ncompelled to feed the soldiers at their own charge. \nFurthermore,\nall the rich men were constrained to pay, in nature of a\ntribute, at one time, the tenth part of all that they were worth.\nTo be short, so that they could find out new inventions, it was\nenough to exact money. For the fear, and custom to endure\nall, had fashioned men to be more slaves, than the murtherers\nand exactors would have had them. And to close up all, the\nTriumviri caused money to be coined, the which on the one\nside had the image of Antonius with an inscription in Latin, the\n\n                  \nwhereof is this: M. Antonius Emperor, Augur, Triumvir,\nfor the establishment of the commonwealth. And on the other\nside there were three hands joined together, with the marks \nof the consulship, and had these words: Salus generis humani,\nthat is to say: 'The \n                   of mankind.'\n\n\n                   Now during the cruelties of this Triumvirate, Brutus\nand his followers made themselves strong in Macedon, and did\ndivers exploits of war: and were afterwards overcome in the\n\n                   as hath been said in the life of Brutus,\nwhich we need not rehearse again, the principal being comprehended \n\n\nthere. After this victory, Antonius went into the east\nto dispose of his affairs in Asia, and to levy money there to pay\nhis soldiers, having promised to every one of them five hundred\ncrowns. Caesar returned into Italy to refresh himself, to assign\ncolonies to his soldiers, to pacify the troubles Lepidus had \n                  and to set a pike betwixt him and Pompey at a need, if\nhe were never so little in league with him. Caesar fell grievously\nsick at Brundusium: but being recovered again, he entered\ninto Rome, pacified all things, and kept Lepidus in his\nwonted degree. But when he came to bring his soldiers into\ncolonies, then the storm began to rise: for the owners cried out\nthat they were tyrannized, being driven out of their inheritances:\nthe old soldiers they complained that promise was not\nkept with them. Fulvia and some others \n                   to set them\non, to the end to draw a war into Italy, and by this means to\nmake Antonius come again, besotted by Cleopatra. These\nthings proceeded so far that Fulvia took arms; for she was then\nin the camp, her sword by her side; and commanded like a captain.\n\nCaesar on the other side, being angry, sent her daughter\nhome to her, unto whom he was betrothed, and led his army\nagainst the Nursinians and Sentinates, the allies of Fulvia. In\nthe mean space Lucius Antonius departed in the night with\nspeed, and entered into Rome by treason: used it as a city\ntaken in war, and drave out Lepidus. Caesar left Salvidienus\nto besiege the Sentinates, returned to Rome, and drave out\nLucius, followed him and shortened his journey as he was going\ninto Gaul, shut him up and besieged him a great time in\n\n                   and compelled him through famine to yield himself,\nand to crave pardon, which he granted him. Perouse was burnt\nby a strange accident: for one of the chiefest of the city having\nset his house on fire, after he had wounded himself with his\ndagger, a boisterous wind being risen upon it so dispersed the\nflames abroad, that it burnt all the houses besides. Caesar\ncaused some of his captains to be killed that were against him.\nHe condemned the Nursinians in a great sum of money, and\nbecause they could not pay it, he drave them out of their city\nand territory. Afterwards he suppressed some troubles raised\nin Naples by Tiberius Claudius Nero, father of Tiberius Caesar,\nand favourer of Fulvia: who seeing herself under foot, she fled\nunto Athens. But Caesar, to prevent a new conspiracy, sent\nLucius Antonius far from Rome, to command the legions that\nwere in Spain: he gave him also commissioners to look into\n\n\nhim, and to observe his actions. He \n                   drave out Lepidus \nalso into Africa with six legions. \n\nOn the other side, Fulvia being dead, Caesar and Antonius agreed, being ready to fight:\nafter that, they made peace with Pompey that governed Sicilia. \nImmediately after that, he went into Gaul, to appease some\ntroubles that happened there, and sent Agrippa before, who \ncompelled the Aquitans to submit themselves, and pacified all \nGaul. On the other side Cneus Calvinus subdued the Ceretanians  \nin Spain. And because the legions had committed certain\ninsolencies, whereupon they \n                  \nand the enemies had the better hand, after he had sharply reproved\nthem, he took the tenth man of the two first bands, and belaboured\nJubellius with a cudgel.\n\n\n                   In the meantime Caesar sent at times troupe of men of\narms into Dalmatia and Illyria, to the end \n                   them;\nfor other wars that were a-hatching, as that of Sicilia was the\nfirst. \nFor Menas the pirate, Sextus Pompeius' lieutenant, having \nfor \n                   brought his fleet unto Caesar, and taken his part, \nunto whom also he delivered the \n                   of Sardinia and Corsica,\nwith three legions, Caesar did him great honours, and refused\nto deliver him again unto Pompey who asked him of him. Besides\nthat, Pompey complained of Antonius, and pretending to\nhave just \n                   he took arms again. Wherefore Caesar\nsent for Antonius and Lepidus out of Greece and Africa, to\ncome to aid him. Antonius came to the haven of Brundusium:\nbut upon the sudden, not known wherefore, he took sea again,\nand returned from whence he came.\n\nLepidus came too late, which made Caesar (seeing all the weight fall on his arms) that he\nsent his lieutenants against Pompey: who fought with them by\nsea and by land, and had the better, and put Caesar to great trouble,\nwho had like to have been killed by a slave also that would\nhave revenged the death of his master's father, that was a proscript.\nAfter that, Antonius being come to Tarentum with intention\nto make war against Caesar, Octavia, sister of the one and\nwife of the other, \n                   them, so that they did yet prolong with\nLepidus their Triumvirate for five years more. Antonius went\nagainst the Parthians, and Caesar prepared to set upon Pompey\nagain. \nHereupon Menas, being angry for that he was not so\nwell accounted of as he thought he deserved, he returned again\nto join with Pompey with seven galleys. Caesar's fleet having\nsustained great hurt by tempest, was also beaten by Menas.\nLepidus won \n                   and took certain neighbour villages.\n\n\n\nCaesar having repaired his ships and army by sea, and made it\nstronger than before, under the conduct of Agrippa, who sailed\nunto \n                   he gave battle by sea unto Pompey's lieutenants.\nBut they being aided by Menas (that was returned the second\ntime), he overcame and \n                   thirty ships.\n\nBut the other fleet that Caesar himself brought, was wholly overthrown by Pompey,\nnear unto Tauromenion, and Caesar brought to that extremity\nthat he was ready to kill himself. But Cornificius ran to the\nshore, who saved him, and brought him to the camp: from\nwhence he retired further off, and very quickly (but with great\ndanger) unto Messala.\n\n\n                   After certain encounters, where Pompey ever had the\nbetter, insomuch as Lepidus was suspected to lean on that side,\nCaesar resolved to commit all to the hazard of a latter battle:\nand to draw Pompey unto it, he cut him so short of victuals,\nthat he was constrained to come to blows, and the fight was\nvery cruel: wherein Agrippa bestirred himself so valiantly, that\nhe wan 2 the victory, sunk twenty-eight ships, brake and spoiled\nthe most part of the rest, and took two of the chiefest captains\nPompey had: one of the which, called Demochares, killed himself\nwith his own hands. \n\nNow for Pompey, who but a little before had about three hundred and fifty sail, he fled away with\nall speed only with seventeen, and went to Messina so discouraged,\nthat leaving all hope and his army he had by land, he\nwent to the \n                   of Cephalonie, where being somewhat come to\nhimself, he determined to repair to Antonius. But Tisienus, a\nFrenchman (his lieutenant of the army by land), led all his\n\n                   unto Lepidus: some Greek historians report that it\nwas to Caesar. Plemminius was within Messina with eight legions,\nand did capitulate with Lepidus, to render up the town\nto him. Whereupon Agrippa happened to come thither: who\nmaintained that they ought to regard Caesar that was absent\nthen. But that stood him in no stead: for Lepidus entered the\ntown, and gave the spoil of it as well to Plemminius' soldiers asto his. \n\nThereupon Caesar undertook a thing worthy of memory,\nwhich was; that, being unarmed, he went into Lepidus' camp,\nand turning by the blows of the darts that were thrown at him\nby some, which hit his cloke and pierced it, he took hold of an\nensign of a legion. Then the soldiers, all of them armed, followed\nhim, and left Lepidus; who shortly after lost empire and\narmy: he that with twenty legions promised himself Sicilia and\na great deal more. Caesar gave him his life, and the office of\n\n\nsovereign bishop of Rome, whither he sent him. Some say he\nwas banished. Upon these stirs there rose a sedition in Caesar's\ncamp through the insolency of the soldiers, that ran even to his\njudgment-seat, using great menaces.\n\nBut he wisely appeased all, punished the authors of the tumult, and did\n\n                   all the\ntenth legion with great shame and ignominy, because the soldiers\nof the same did outbrave2 him in words. He dispersed\nand sent some others to their houses, and gave unto them that\nhad used themselves gently two thousand sesterces for every\nsoldier: which is thought to amount near to fifty crowns. He\nmade them to be mustered, and found that they were five and\nforty legions, five and twenty thousand horsemen, and six and\nthirty thousand lightly armed. Afterwards he did great honours\nunto his lieutenant Agrippa for his notable service, and commanded\nStatilius Taurus to go into Africa to take possession of\nthe provinces of Lepidus. \n\nWhilst Antonius made war with the Parthians, or rather\n\n                  \nthey made war with him to his great confusion, his lieutenant Titius found the means to\nlay hands upon Sextus Pompeius, that was fled into the \n                   of\nSamos, and then forty years old: whom he put to death by\nAntonius' commandment: for which \n                   he was so hated of\nthe people of Rome, that though he had given them the pastime\nof certain plays at his own cost and charges, they drave him \nout of the theatre.\n\n\n                   Moreover, Caesar, thinking to have sailed out of Sicilia\ninto Mauritania, the sea being rough stayed him: which was the\ncause that he sent his army into Illyria, and set upon the\nIapudes, which did him much mischief, yet at the last he overcame\nthem. \nThen he ran upon the Pannonians and the Dalmatians,\nwhom he made tributaries; being hurt in his thighs,\nin his arms, and in one of his knees, in this war against the\nIllyrians. On the other side, Messala, his lieutenant, fought\nagainst the Salassians, dwelling in a valley environed with high\nmountains of the Alps; and after divers overthrows, he made\nthem subject to the empire. And shortly after Caesar was\nchosen consul the second time: but he resigned the office the\nsame day unto Autronius Paetus, being about to make himself\nfriends against Antonius: who, being \n                  \nabout Cleopatra, gave his wife \n                  \nto return from Athens to Rome. Now after the fire of enmity betwixt these two competitors had been\na-hatching a certain time, it \n                  , to\nseek ail the means to overthrow his companion. The strange\n\n\nproceedings of Antonius in favour of Cleopatra hastened the\nwar, whereupon followed the battle of Actium, the flying of\nthese wicked lovers, and the beginning of the monarchy of\nCaesar, confirmed by the conquest of Egypt, and the tragical\ndeath of Antonius and Cleopatra. The which we touch briefly,\nthe whole being largely set down in the life of Antonius. They\ndid great honours unto Caesar after these exploits. The memory\nof Antonius was condemned, and his statues maimed and thrown\ndown to the ground. A little before, M. Lepidus, son of the\nTriumvir and of Junia sister of Brutus, conspired against Caesar.\n\nBut after they had discovered it, he was put to death by the\nwisdom of C. Mecenas a knight, and governor of Rome: his\nwife Servilia killed herself, as Portia the wife of Brutus.\n\nAfter the utter overthrow of Antonius, Caesar \n                  \nfor the affairs of the east parts. He made alliance with Herodes king of Judea.\nHe sent the king of the Parthians son in hostage to Rome, until\nthey should send all the ensigns and standards they had won\nof Crassus and Antonius. He governed the affairs of Asia, received\ninto league and friendship with him the kings of Galatia,\nCappadocia, and Paphlagonia: and he punished some others by\nfines, that were not his friends. He gave privileges to the cities\nof Ephesus, of Nice, Pergame, and Bithynia, to build temples\nin the honour of Julius Caesar, of Rome, and of himself. He\nset the Samians at liberty, and after he had taken order1 for all\nthe rest, he went towards Italy: where, after he was arrived, it\ncannot be expressed with what great joy he was received of\nhigh and low, from Brundusium unto Rome. \nThere he triumphed three days together, for the Illyrians, for Antonius, and\nfor Cleopatra. He gave great presents unto soldiers, and besides\nthe money that was made of the booty, and distributed by\neven portions, he gave every one fifty crowns apiece, the double\nto a \n                   and the treble to a knight: and to every person\namong the people ten crowns, even to little children. He\nbrought such store of gold and silver out of Egypt (by him reduced\ninto a province, and condemned to pay twenty millions\nof gold to the people of Rome for a fine) that he brought down\nusury from twelve in the hundred, to four: and made that land\nand houses were sold dear, where before the rich men had\nthem almost for nothing. Furthermore, he \n                  a marvellous\nchange in all traffic: he also abolished all taxes and\nsubsidies imposed by necessity of the civil wars. He cried\ndown all strange coin, which were at too high a price for their\n\n\nlaw, and all through the iniquity of time. He lent out money \nfor a time, without interest, unto those that had means to make\ndouble profit of it. He would not receive the gold which the\ncities of Italy sent him to make him crowns: but sent them it\nback again with his thanks for their good will He gave the\npastime for all manner of games and magnificent sights unto\nthe people, such as they had never seen before. He made\ngoodly feasts unto the senators and magistrates, and by a world\nof pleasures he appeased the sorrow of proscription, and of so\nmany civil wars. \nBeing occupied in these matters, letters came\nfrom Crassus, Caesar's lieutenant, advertising that he had subdued\nthe Bastarnes, divers people of Maesia, of Dacia, and of\nThracia: that he had won seven or eight battles of them, that\nwith his own hands he had killed the king of the Bastarnes,\nand had brought the king of Getes to such extremity, that he\nkilled himself. \nThese news did increase the joy, and the triumph\nwas granted to Crassus, and to Caesar also: who by the\ndecree of the Senate caused the temple of Janus to be shut the\nthird time, which had remained open the space of 200 years.\nAt this time Caesar, that was in his \n                   consulship, numbered\nand mustered all the people of Rome, reformed the senate, the\norder of knights, the distribution of corn: and because of the\ngreat dearth that was then, he made corn to be distributed to\nthe people at a very mean price to some, and for \n                  \nto the poor. \nThey that had been bound to the commonwealth of\ntoo long a time, he discharged them and burnt their obligations.\nHe confirmed the propriety of houses, in strife betwixt them and\nthe commonwealth, if they had been in quiet possession any\nconvenient time. And to assure all those that had adhered\nunto Antonius, and to keep them that they should no more\ngive ear to any new rumours, he \n                   unto them in good\nfaith, that having taken Antonius' coffers, he had burnt all the \nletters he found in them, and read not one of them. He set\ndown an order for \n                  ,\neased the \n                   that had been\ntoo much oppressed: also he restored the treasure again, and\nthe augur of health. And by reason of that above-named, he\nwas called Father of the Country in open Senate: and at the\nsame time he sent people to Carthage, to set up the families of\nthe patricians, greatly diminished by the proscriptions and civil\nwars.\n\n\n                   \n                  \nThe next year following, which was the 725 of the foundation\nof Rome, and the \n                   of his consulship, seeing all the\n\nwars appeased, peace established, arms laid down everywhere,\nthe commonwealth in good strength, the laws honoured, justice\nin authority, the senate in their ancient glory, and the people\nrestored by him to their rights of assembly to choose their\nyearly magistrates, and to give out their commissions and\ncharges according to their old custom: he began to reason the\nmatter with himself, which of the twain was most profitable,\neither to keep (for the good of the state, and under the title of\na prince) the empire which he had in his hands: or whether he\nshould render it up unto the people. He found himself grieved\nfor that Antonius had oftentimes accused him of tyranny and\nunjust invasion: and on the other part also he apprehended the\nfury of the people, and the factions of ambitious men, which,\nlike the billows of the sea, would \n                   toss in horrible\nfashion this unconstant sea. Being thus perplexed, one day he\ntook aside Agrippa and C. Macenas, his two faithful friends'\nvery wise men and of great experience above all others; and\nprayed them to tell him plainly, without flattery, what they\nthought of it, being resolved to follow that which should be\nmost expedient for the good of the commonwealth. Agrippa\nby an ample discourse did counsel him to render up to the\npeople his principality and \n                  .\nMaecenas was of the\ncontrary opinion, and gave such counsel as Caesar followed,\ntempering both opinions, and made himself master in such sort\nthat the people felt it not, but rather confessed that they needed\nsuch a physician to raise them up again from the incurable maladies\nthey were fallen into. He thanked both his friends, gave\nhis niece Marcella to be the wife of Agrippa, and did him new\nhonours; proceedeth to a new review of the citizens of Rome;\nand is chosen Prince of the Senate by Agrippa, who was then\nhis companion in the consulship. Furthermore, assuring himself\nthat so much good and honours as had been communicated\nto the small and great, would make them they would not much\n\n                   their ancient dignities and liberty: and that the sweetness\nof the ease and rest they did enjoy would make them forget\nall the good and evil past; he borrowed of his magnanimity\nthe marvellous counsel that followeth. He resolved to discharge\nhimself of the principality into the hands of all the Senate, to\nrender it unto the people; hoping that the Senate, seeing his\naffection so to submit himself to the accustomed order, and not\nto seek a domination and government \n                  , they \nwould thank him the more: that all the great persons would lay \naside\n\n\nthe envy which they might bear unto him, and that the people\nwould esteem and love him so much the more. Upon this\nthought, and after he had acquainted some of the senators\nwithal that stood affected to him, to the end to win others by\ntheir means, he made an oration in open Senate, well studied,\nand fit for the time. Having made a long discourse of the great\nextent of the empire, and of his insufficiency, he added unto it,\nthat this common burthen could not be carried but by the immortal\ngods: that he had continued some years to manage a\npart of it, and that experience had made him know that his\nshoulders were too weak to bear such a burthen as the principality,\nsubject to infinite changes, and exposed to a thousand\nambushes. \nHe therefore \n                  , the city being furnished\nwith so many noble persons, that the affairs might be managed\nby many men, who joining themselves together, might more\neasily satisfy the charges than one alone: that in a good hour,\nhaving set all things in good estate again, he did put the commonwealth\ninto the hands of the Senate and people of Rome.\nThis oration diversely moved the senators. Some of them\nthought, there was more art than truth in it. Others judged,\nthat it was not expedient to put the estate into the power of\nmany. The most of them, enriched and made great by Caesar,\nand that were risen up by the ruins of their country, said: that\nthey should prefer that which now they had in hand, before all\nthe time past, beaten with so many tempests. Many others \n                  to that side, not that they were in good earnest of that\nmind, but for fear to be looked upon with an evil eye, if they\ndid speak against their companions. \n\nSo then all of them with one consent, unadvisedly, rather than of a common and ripe\njudgment, began to beseech and adjure Caesar, that it would\nplease him to be chief and preserver of the empire, of the which\nhe had set down so many goodly and happy foundations. Immediately\nthey ordained that Caesar's guard should have twice\nas much pay as they had before. Agrippa was of opinion, that\nthey should \n                   the Spanish guard, and Caesar in their\nplace should choose a guard of \n                  , knowing well that in\nthose great bodies there was little malice hidden, and less subtilty:\nand that they were a people that took more pleasure to be\ncommanded, than to command.\n\n\n                   \n                  \ntypeHe being thus established in his empire by the consent\nof the Senate and people, to the end they should not think\nhe could lift himself up above measure, or to give sure footing\n\nto a perpetual monarchy: he would not accept the charge to\nprovide for the affairs of \n                  , and the government of the provinces,\nbut for the space of ten years: with condition to give up\nhis charge before this term, if things were sooner settled in their\nfull estate. First therefore, he left a part of the provinces unto\nthe Senate and people, to take care for the government of the\nsame: and for himself, he kept those that were not yet in order,\nand in the which he should be driven to make war. In those\nthat were quiet, he established proconsuls: and for others' he\ngoverned them by his lieutenants, which had their lesson, according\nunto the which they were bound to be directed. Among\nother laws they were forbidden to \n                   any money, or to gather\nmen of war together, or to assail any province, without the\ncommandment of the Senate or of Caesar. That forthwith, when\nthey sent any successors, they should leave their government,\nand repair to Rome within three months. He appointed also\nunto the proconsuls a certain sum of money to bear their\ncharges for their \n                   and carriage of the stuff. Furthermore\nhe established a law, that the proconsul or governor should not\ngo to his province appointed him, till the end of five years after\nhis commission granted him: to the end that they which were\n\n                   for taking of money corruptly, should pay to the\nprovinces the fine they should be condemned in: and he deprived\nthem of all estates and honours which through their evil\nbehaviours had been condemned in such fines. And further,\nhe would not that the officers that had to deal in his affairs\nshould have any authority, \n                   to demand their stipends and\nmoney which the provinces were bound to furnish. \n\nAnd because he would beautify and adorn Rome, as the majesty of the\nempire required, he raised up many common buildings, and repaired\nmany that had been left unfinished or ruined, leaving the\nnames of the founders. His buildings, among other, were the\ntemple of Apollo in the palace, with the porch, and a library of\nGreek and Latin books. Also the monuments, and the park for\nthe walks and pleasure of the people of Rome. In his seventh\nconsulship, certain senators propounded, that they should call\nhim Romulus, for that, he having preserved the city of Rome, it\nwas as much bound unto him as unto the first founder. But\nhe would not accept of that name.\n\nWherefore Munacius Plancus bethought himself of another, the which was given unto him\nby common consent of all, and he held it to his death: as also\nwe will call him from henceforth in all that remaineth to be set\n\n\ndown of his deeds: \n                  , Augustus. He, not to seem unworthy\nof this name, and to carry himself so that no man should\nrepent his change of government, began diligently to set his\nhand to these affairs. \nHe wisely reformed the ancient laws, and made new that were very necessary. To make sure work in\nthese affairs, he chose from six months to six months fifteen\nsenators that had been consuls, and did privately acquaint\nthem with all that was requisite to be done for the preservation\nof the quietness of the commonwealth, giving order that nothing\nshould pass but it should be searched and examined to the bottom:\nsaying that he would give the people laws which they\nshould all \n                  , and that he would not be his own judge alone.\nAfterwards he reformed the assemblies of the city, where all\nthings were carried by suits, presents, and violence. He then\nrestored the people their right, by \n                   to choose the magistrates.\nAnd to cut off all suits, he forbade them to make any\nroll of suitors' names, \n                   of those that had laid down great\nsums of money, to the end that, being \n                   their suits,\nthey should be put to their fines: adding also this ignominy,\nthat such should be deprived of all estates and honours for the\nspace of five years. \nAnd furthermore, he \n                   hindered the\nbad practices in elections, giving order that none should be put\nin nomination but such as were virtuous and of good reputation.\nHe left unto the magistrates their \n                   whole, and did\nalways \n                   in all his consulships that they should give him\ntwo companions; howbeit the Senate would never agree unto it.\nThe year before, he had reduced the number of senators to six\nhundred, ail honourable men. At that time also he re-established\nthe ancient order and dignity: ordaining that the Senate\nshould have the superintendency of the treasure, and of all the\nrevenues that belonged to the people of Rome: that all the\nexpenses for the commonwealth should be made by their ordinance:\nthat the senators should have the hearing of all crimes\nof treason, conspiracy, ambushes, and offences to his Majesty's\nperson: and that it should pertain to them to give entertainment\nand answer that should be fit, to ambassadors of nations.\nWhen in matters of importance he asked the advice of the\nSenate, instead of coming to the Prince of the Senate according\nto the accustomed manner, or to him that was appointed Consul,\nor to other senators by order: he made choice of any one\nof them which he thought good, to the end that every one\nshould give attentive ear, and be ready to deliver his opinion:\n\n\n\nand not to hold his head down in his rank, and content himself\nto be of other men's minds. He ordained also, that the whole\nbody of the Senate should not assemble but from fifteen days\nto fifteen days: howbeit that in ordinary matters the magistrates\nshould think of that that were expedient. In the months of September\nand October, the senators were not bound to meet, but\nonly four hundred drawn by lot: who might establish any decree.\nAnd as for himself, to honour this company the more, the\nday of the assembly he never saluted any of the senators apart,\nbut all of them together in the council-chamber when they were\nset, and all of them name by name, the one after the other. If\nhe would go out, and that he said he would detain the company\nno longer, he bade them farewell in the same manner that he\nhad saluted them at his coming in.\n\nHe ruled justice also civil and criminal, and willed that amongst other things the criminals\naccused by certain enemies should be set at liberty: with condition\nnotwithstanding that they should be brought to prison\nagain, if the accuser did submit himself to receive the like\npunishment as the offender, if it were found he slandered him.\nMoreover, he made provision for common works, and reparations\nof bridges, \n                  , and highways. And because he was\ndetermined to make a voyage into Gaul, he established Messala\ngovernor of Italy and of Rome, for fear lest any trouble should\nhappen in his absence. \nBut this place being troublesome untoMessala, he besought \nAugustus he would discharge him: andtherefore Agrippa was\nsubstituted, who rid all Italy of a great\nnumber of thieves and robbers on highways, and stayed the\ncourses of many other troubles of the state.\n\n\n                   The affairs of Rome and Italy being in so quiet estate,\nunderstanding that England was full of sedition, Spain next\nunto the mountains Pirenei in arms, and Gaul ready to rise:\nhe opened the temple of Janus, and took his journey to give\norder for all. But the ambassadors of England \n                  him, and promised tribute. Then he went to Gaul in Narbonne,\nto draw nearer to Spain. And so holding on his journey to\nNarbonne, he pacified the Gauls, he made an exact numbering\nof all the Gauls, of their goods, possessions, and slaves, and\ncaused the rolls to be brought unto him.\n\nHe established laws and customs in every place, and divided Gaul into four parts:\nof the which the first part was called Narbonense, which extendeth\nitself from the river of Var unto the mountains Pirenei.\nAquitain the second, unto the river of Garonne. The third,\n\nGaul Lyonnoise, unto the river of Seine. Then Gaul Belgica,\nbordered with the river of \n                  :\nand rated all the Gauls at ten millions of gold for a tax. Now there remained no more\nfor him to do, but to bring Spain to order: in the which the\nRomans had made continual wars the space of 200 years together.\nNevertheless the Cantabrians and Asturians (which\nare the Basques) and other people neighbours dwelling in the\nmountains, they neither cared for Augustus, nor for the empire:\nfor they were ever in arms, and made incursions upon the allies\nof the people of Rome, and did them great mischief, who complaining\nunto Augustus of the great necessity they were brought\nunto, he, being near unto them, came to aid them: and found\nthe Cantabrians besieging of a fort, having taken the town by\nit called Sagesame. He charged them home with such fury\nthat he left them dead in the place, after they had valiantly defended\nthemselves. \nAfterwards he divided his army into three\nparts, and environed the country of the Cantabrians, who made\nhead for the space of five years, and did marvellous great hurt\nto the Romans: and if the \n                  ,\nwhereby they might easily enter into their country, had not been discovered unto Augustus,\nthey had sent him home again to Rome with shame. But\nhaving found the way to surprise them on every side, he made\na cruel war upon them, putting all to fire and blood. They retired\nwith speed to one of their highest mountains, with all that they\ncould carry with them. The Romans, perceiving that it was\ntoo hard a match for them, if they should go thither to set upon\nso warlike a nation, and that could not be subdued by force;\nthey made forts in the midst of the mountain, and placed a\nstrong guard there, to the end to famish the Cantabrians, and\nby that means to bring them to reason. But they on the other\nside, instead of yielding themselves, did \n                   all the miseries\nthat any man can possibly think of: and it came to that pass,\nthat even to sustain nature the strong sons killed their own fathers,\nthe mothers their infants, and the young men did devour\nthe old, eating up their flesh. Upon this evil there followed\nanother, to wit, discord among them. Some would yield, others\nwere of another mind. The former alleging, that they must\nneeds submit themselves to the mercy of the Romans: the\nother, that they should make a desperate sally upon the enemies'\ncamp, and so sell their lives. Their contention waxed so hot\nand violent, that the Cantabrians thrust out ten thousand of the\nAsturians with their wives and children, and compelled them to\n\n\n\ndescend along the forts made by the Romans: whom they intreated\nwith the tears in their eyes to make them slaves, and\nto give them somewhat to eat. Tiberius then, one of Caesar's\nlieutenants, would not suffer them to be received, to the end to\nfamish the one by the other, and to end this war without any\nbloodshed. This poor people, being deprived of sustenance and\nhope, and being afraid they should yet endure greater evils, began\nto \n                   a venomous herb like unto \n                  , and poisoned\nthemselves. The young men killed themselves, running\none against another with their swords in their hands. The\nothers, to the number of three and twenty thousand, came down\nin a most miserable \n                   from the top of the mountain, and\nyielded themselves to the discretion of the Romans; who set\naside ten thousand of the strongest of them, to serve them in\nthe war which they intended to make against the Asturians.\nThe rest were sold by \n                  , with condition that they should\nbe carried far from their country, and that they should not be\nmade free, before they had served them as slaves the space of\nthirty years. They disarmed ten thousand of them: which they\nbare so \n                  ,\nthat many killed themselves with their own\nhands, esteeming their life nothing without arms. They say\nthat a little child with a dagger killed his father and brethren\nthat were chained together, and that by the commandment of\nthe father: and that a woman did the like to some of her kinsfolks.\nAnd that many of these \n                  \naccustomed to rob passengers, being upon the gibbet, sang out songs aloud, even\nat their death, strewing a joy and marvellous courage. Augustus,\nbeing then in those parts, gave leave to the soldiers of his\nguard of Spaniards to depart into the territory of the Gascons\nwith great presents, and privilege to enter in rank amongst the\nRoman legions. He built \n                  ,\nand other towns, which he replenished with soldiers, to bridle the courses and tumults\nof the Celtiberians: and afterwards made a stone bridge over\nthe famous river of \n                  . \n\nThen having overthrown the Conisces, friends of the Asturians, taken their head city, and put\nall the inhabitants thereof to the sword: he set upon the Asturians,\nwho, being environed of all parts, and choosing rather to\ndie than to be made slaves, burnt, killed, and poisoned themselves,\nand with them many other of their neighbours. There\nwere some of them yet left alive, with whom the Cantabrians\njoined and other their neighbours, and that a long time. These people had this custom, that all goods were common amongst\n\n\nfriends, and when one of them came to the other, he received\nand used him as himself: and so also in adversity they ran one\n\n                  ,\nor else killed themselves immediately after their friends\nwere dead. Among them were certain loose people gathered\ntogether out of divers parts, who resolved all together to go\ncharge the Romans, and came to fight with such a fury, that\nnothing but the night could separate them, having lost many of\nboth sides. The next morning they began to \n                  \nagain with more violence than before, and the fight continued even till\nnight, that the Romans obtained the victory: but they confessed,\nthat they never encountered with such cruel enemies. They\nthat were left alive fled into a town, in the defence whereof they\nmade themselves all to be killed, rather than to yield themselves.\nAugustus built certain places there in that country,\nwhich afterwards by time were much enlarged. In this selfsame\nyear of his ninth consulship, Terentius Varro, his lieutenant,\nsubdued the Salassians, which are those of the vale of\nOstre: he disarmed them, sold the young men by the \n                  ,\ngave part of the territory unto the soldiers Praetorians, and\nbuilt there a city called Augusta Praetoria. Vinicius also appeased\nsome troubles in Germany, and made war very fortunately\nin divers places. By means of which victories, Augustus\nwas called the \n                   time Imperator, as much to say as sovereign\ncaptain: and they suffered him to wear from that time\nforth, the first day of the year, a hat of laurel and a robe of triumph.\nAt his return he shut the temple of Janus the fourth\ntime, married Cleopatra (the daughter of Antonius and Cleopatra) \nunto Juba the story-writer, overthrown by Julius Caesar\nin Africa, with a part of Mauritania and of Getulia, to reign\nthere. He reduced into a province Gallogrecia and Lycaonia,\nwhich made a portion of a kingdom: and, by reason of his sickness,\nnot able to be present at the marriage of his daughter\nJulia, whom Marcellus married, the son of Octavia his sister,\nhe left all to the charge of Agrippa, and went to Rome. There\nbeing chosen Consul the tenth time, the Senate gave him absolute\npower over the estate and laws, to make and undo them at\nhis pleasure. They did him greater honours than before, and\ngave Marcellus his nephew, before his time, great offices in the\ncommonwealth: and to Tiberius his wife's son.\n\nHe in token of thankfulness gave to everyone of the people ten crowns\napiece. Whilst these matters were in hand, the Cantabrians\nand their neighbours revolted, by subtilty caught some of the\n\n\n\nRomans, and cut their throats. Aelius Lamia, governor in\nthose parts, to be revenged of this outrage, put all the whole\ncountry to fire and blood, destroyed some towns, and sold their\nyoung men by the drum. To be short, he followed them so\nhard, that he brought them in subjection. Aelius Gallus, governor\nof Egypt, almost about the same time, being sent by\nAugustus' commandment with ten thousand men, five hundred\nsoldiers of Herod's guard, and fifteen hundred Nabateians under\nthe conduct of a noble man of Arabia called Sylleus, he did\nnothing to be accounted of, but discover the country. But\nhaving lost the most part of his men within the deserts where\nthis Sylleus brought them, and overcome the Sabeans in a battle,\nhe was enforced to retire. Afterwards this Sylleus, for that\nhe killed his king Oboda by treason, he was taken prisoner, and\nbeheaded by the decree of the Senate.\n\n\n                   Augustus being consul for the eleventh time, the plague\nwas in Rome; and, for himself, he was grievously sick but\nrestored again to health by Antonius Musa his physician; the\npeople therefore caused a statue to be set up to this Antonius,\nthe Senate did him great honours, and, in favour of his profession,\ngave immunity to all others that from that time forth\ndid practice physic. \n\nFurthermore, by many ceremonies they did\nshew the joy they had for the health of Augustus: and specially\nfathers of household, dying, expressly commanded their children\nto bring their sacrifices to the Capitol with a title in great letters,\nsaying: THAT AT THE DAY OF THEIR DEATH THEY LEFT\nAUGUSTUS IN GOOD HEALTH. It was also ordained that from\nthat time forth they should never put any man to death, as often\nas Augustus entered into the city. Shortly after he did associate\nwith himself Calpurnius Piso in the consulship, who had followed\nthe party of Pompey and of Brutus. Afterwards, when he was\ngone from Rome into the country, he made Lucius Cestius his\ndeputy for him, an \n                   friend of Brutus and of his memory.\nWhereat the Senate marvelling, by decree made him perpetual\nproconsul of the Roman empire, tribune of the people, and gave\nhim power to assemble the Senate as often and when it pleased\nhim. The people would have compelled him to have been\ndictator: but he bowing a knee, casting down his long robe,\nand strewing his breast, besought them to discharge him of so\nodious an \n                  . In the meantime he accepted the decree of\nthe Senate, and the charge to cause corn to be brought in,\nbecause of the dearth that chanced in Rome. In the which he\n\n\nserved his turn by Tiberius, created quaestor at the age of nineteen\nyears. As for Marcellus his nephew, he was chosen Aedilis Curulis,\nwho aided him to set forth all the magnificent pomp of plays,\nwhich he caused to be played before the people.\n\nEvery man judged that he should be the successor of all his power: but\nthis young man of great hope died shortly after, to the great\ngrief of every man: and no man can tell whether it was of\nnatural sickness, or of poison given him by the practices of\nLivia. A little before his death, Agrippa, impatient to bear the\nrising of this Marcellus whom he despised, went into Asia under\n\n                   of another voyage. They say that Augustus, much\ntroubled with sickness, returned to his first consultation, to put\nthe commonwealth again into the hands of the Senate and\npeople; and for this cause he called for the senators and all the\nother magistrates, unto whom he gave an account of the empire;\nand that was a little book containing the numbering \nof all the riches, towns, and provinces, allies, legions, armies by sea and\nby land, of all the kingdoms and countries tributary, of all the\ncustoms of the empire of Rome, that which was necessary to \nbe \n                   or released. But being somewhat amended again, he\nchanged his mind. And furthermore, having given audience to\nthe ambassadors of Phrahartes king of the Parthians, which\ndemanded a son of his brought by Tyridates unto Augustus, he\nsent back the child, and suffered Tyridates to remain at \nRome, where he sumptuously entertained him. By this \nmeans he kept himself in friendship with the one and the other, and held \nthe Parthians in suspense, to the end they should alter \nnothing. At the beginning of the next year following, under the consulship\nof M. Claudius Marcellus and of L. Arruntius, the famine increasing\nat Rome, he wisely provided for it. And then the\npeople would constrain him by force to accept the dictatorship,\nand threatened to set the palace on fire and to burn \nall the senators in it, if they refused to allow this decree. He would\nnone of the office of dictatorship, and did refuse also to be\ncensor, although that office had been void the space of 28 years.\nBut forasmuch as Munacius Plancus and Aemilius Lepidus,\nwho were chosen censors, deserved themselves to be censured,\nbecause of their discords, Augustus without the name took upon\nhim to discharge it: and provided to reform infinite disorders\nthat were in Rome, in apparel, \n                  ,\ncompanies, and in the fight of fencers \n                  .\nAt the same time Fannius Caepio and L. Muraena, having conspired against him, and being\n\n\n\ndiscovered by Castricius, were taken as they thought to have\nescaped, and put to death. In the meantime the Asturians and\nCantabrians, ill \n                  \nby Carisius, they rebelled, but were overcome in a set battle, and the prisoners sold. The Cantabrians,\npreferring death before servitude, killed, burnt, and\npoisoned \n                  .\nThe Asturians, being overcome the fourth time, did submit themselves, and their arms were\ntaken from them. In the same time, Petronius, governor of\nEgypt, followed with IO,OOO footmen, and with 800 horse, went\nto make war with the Ethiopians, which dwell under Egypt,\nwho had invaded and ruined certain towns, overthrown and\ncarried away the statues of Augustus. Thereupon he pursued\nthem, and made them fly before him: took certain places upon\nthem, and pierced far into their country: so that he \n                   their queen to send her ambassadors unto Augustus (then\nwintering in the \n                   of Samos) to pray peace, which he granted\nthem paying tribute.\n\n\n                   At the beginning of the spring he prepared himself to\ngive order for the affairs in the east; but because they that bent\nthemselves for the consulship had almost put the city in alarm,\nand that in the end, notwithstanding the order he had set down,\nthe people had chosen men whom Augustus feared: through\nthe advice of Maecenas, be made Agrippa come again to govern\nRome in his absence, and married unto him his daughter Julia,\nMarcellus' widow. \n\nNow whilst Agrippa gave order for the affairs\nof the city, Augustus took sea, and having provided for the\naffairs of Sicilia, he went into Greece, did much good for the\nLacedaemonians, and to the contrary, repressed the pride of the\nAthenians, from whom he took away the tribute they had \n                  \nof the \n                   Aegina and Eretria. In the meantime, though he\nmade little account of strangers' ceremonies, yet he made himself\nto be received into the fraternity of mysteries; and the ambassadors\nof Persia having caused the temple of Jupiter Olympian\nto be finished, begun of long time in Athens, they ordained that\nit should be dedicated to the spirit of Augustus. Being passed\nfrom thence into Asia, he gave order to his provinces and those\nof the people of Rome; punished the Cyzicenians that had killed\nthe Roman citizens in their town. He imposed a tribute upon\nthose of Tyre and Sidon, who had dealt badly, and brought\nthem into the form of a province. He did much good unto the\ntowns that had been faithful unto the commonwealth: to some\nof them he gave the right of burgesship of Rome, and to others\n\n\nthe same rights and privileges which the natural \ncitizens of Rome had. He built up again the cities of Laodicea, \nand of Thyatira: he set them up of the \n                   of Chio again, \nafflicted before by an earthquake; he did exempt them from all \nsubsidies for six years. He restored certain realms unto their \nkings whom he had subdued: or else he did establish others anew, who came\nto attend him at his court as subjects, without any signs or\ntokens of royal dignity. He sent Tiberius into Armenia, to\ninstal Tigranes unto his royal throne again, having beer. driven\nout of it. Tiberius returned thither, and having fought with the\nArmenians, he gave them Artavasdes to their king, who ruled\nnot long. Phraates, king of the Parthians, being afraid they\nwould set upon him, was very careful to get all the Romans\ntogether, which were taken after the overthrow of Crassus and\nAntonius; whom he sent, every man of them, unto Augustus,\nwith all the standards and ensigns, and also his son and nephews\nfor pledges of his faithful friendship unto the people of Rome.\nAugustus granted him peace, and then he came into the ile1 of\nSamos, comforted Rhodes replenished Corinth and Patras with\na great number of men enfranchised, whom he made burgesses\nof Rome. In this place also there came unto him ambassadors\nfrom Porus and Pandion, two of the mightiest kings of the\nIndians, who prayed alliance and friendship with him, and\nbrought him very rare presents. There came with them a\nphilosopher of India called Zannanus: who being brought to\nthe city of Athens, burnt himself alive, as one Calamus did in\nthe time of Alexander the Great.\n\n\n                   \n                  \nIn this mean space the city of Rome was full of great\ntrouble by the \n                   of Egnatius Rufus, who by force would\nneeds be chosen consul in Augustus' place being absent: who\ngave not him his \n                  , but named Lucretius Vespillo, escaped\nfrom the proscription, as hath been spoken of before. But this\nput him in such a rage, that he conspired with M. Genucius and\nPlautius Rufus to kill Augustus. But they being discovered\nbetimes, were imprisoned and executed by decree of the Senate:\nwho made infinite numbers of honours unto Augustus at his\nreturn: howbeit he would not accept them all, but carried himself\nvery modestly in every place where he was. The people\nchose him censor for five years, and perpetual consul: and at\nhis request they granted triumph unto Cornelius Balbus, although\nhe were no Roman born (for he was a Spaniard) by reason of\nhis notable victories he had obtained as lieutenant of Augustus,\n\n\nupon the Garamantes. \nAgrippa on the other side was sent into\nGaul troubled by the invasions of the Germans, whom he\nordered well enough. Then he led his army into Spain, troubled\nwith the rebellion of the Cantabrians: the which came thus to\npass. The prisoners Cantabrians, whom they had sold \n                  , by a complot they made together, cut their masters'\nthroats, and then fled into their country, where they solicited\nothers to take arms, got their fortresses into their hands, and\nset upon the Roman garrisons. Agrippa could by no means\nbring his soldiers thither; whether that they desired to take\nrest, or that the \n                   of the Cantabrians did astonish\nthem. But after that he had brought them to his hand, he\nmarched directly against the enemies: who had the better at\nthe first encounter, and the Romans were well beaten. But they\nbeing rebuked and punished by Agrippa, who gave them barley\nfor wheat, he returned again to fight. But then the Cantabrians\nthat bare arms were all cut in pieces, the rest disarmed, and\ndrawn from the mountain to dwell in the plain. Augustus was\nsaluted emperor or sovereign captain, because of this victory:\nbut Agrippa modestly refused triumph, and within a while after\nhe overcame the Pannonians also. The year following, the\nGetes and Daces being at civil wars, Lentulus that had subdued\nthem before, counselled Augustus not to lose this \n                  :\nfor he might easily subdue these barbarous people being thus\ndivided. \nBut Augustus not being of the mind to make any\nwars at all with any nation, without great and just cause\n(although there were more hope of gain than appearance of\nloss), he answered: \"There was no cause for him to do so:\"\nadding also, \" that those that sought a little gain with great loss\nand danger were like unto those that would angle with a golden\nhook, the which breaking and falling into the water, no fish is\nworth the value of it. And therefore that the \n                  \nwere to be left to their own miseries: and that by their bloodshed by\ntheir own companions, they were more than enough punished\nfor the ills they had done to the Romans, who ought not to\nbegin first to do evil.\"\n\n\n                   \n                  \nIn the same year Augustus, being very desirous to put\nhis hand to the reformation of abuses in Rome, and that effectually,\nhe joined with him his nephew Agrippa in the state of a\ncensor, and did establish him tribune for five years. First of all\nhe began to correct some disorders that were in the Senate, he\nreformed the knights, spectacles, and plays, and the manner of\n\n\n                  \n                   for public offices. He set fines upon their heads that\nwould not marry, and bestowed much upon them that had wives\nand children. He gave unto Hortensius Hortalius five and\ntwenty thousand crowns, to procure him to take a wife, that he\nmight raise up issue to that noble house and family of the\nHortenses. \nHe ordained also that maidens should be twelve\nyears old at the least before they married, and suffered them to\nkill adulterers taken with the \n                   without punishment. ....\n\nAnd for military discipline, he looked very carefully unto that.\nAnd because a knight of Rome had cut off his own son's thumbs,\nfor that he should not go to the war, he made him to be sold by\nthe drum, and all his goods. But because the \n                  \nwere greedy to seize upon them, he made them cease the sale, and\nput the knight into the hands of one of his bondmen enfranchised,\nand was contented to drive him out of Rome. Furthermore\nhe procured that the Senate should not be kept but with\ngreat reverence: that the senators should come together as into\na temple of devotion, and that no decree should pass, but in the\npresence of 400 senators, if it might be: that no man should be\nmade free of Rome but upon great consideration. For the rest,\nhe and Agrippa gave the people the pleasure of secular yearly\ngames, which had not been seen an hundred years before. But\nhe took very great care that there should no \n                  \nbe committed. He punished the players in divers sorts that behaved\nthemselves more licentiously than became them. And\nwhen one of them amongst them called him lord, he shewed the\npeople with his voice, his eyes, and his hand, that he was not\nwell pleased withal: and the next morning he published a sharp\nedict, forbidding all persons expressly to say so, and would never\nsuffer that any of his should give him this name. But these\nplays being ended, he adopted Caius and Lucius the sons of\nAgrippa. In all this great business, the Sicambres, Usipetes,\nand Tenchteres, people of Germany, surprised certain Romans\nin their territory, \n                   them up, passed over the Rhine,\nspoiled Gaul, overthrew certain horsemen, and following their\npurpose, overcame M. Lollius proconsul of Gaul, and took away\nan ensign from him. \nYet though he were a man of small action\nand very courteous, nevertheless he was revenged of them, and \ncoming upon the invaders, fought with them, and drave them \nbeyond the Rhine. On the other side, C. Lentulus made war \nwith the Daces, and killed three of their chief leaders with a \ngreat number of men: and afterwards he established a garrison \n\n\n\nby the river of \n                  , to stop the incursions of this wild\nnation. Augustus seeing these troubles, disposed of the affairs\nof Italy to go into Gaul, to rid himself of these griefs and by\nhis absence to make his presence more honourable.\n\nAt that same time, divers peoples inhabiting upon the river of \n                  ,\nrebelled: but Augustus' lieutenants bestirred them so well, that\nthey were all compelled to seek peace. At that time also all\nGaul was in commotion, and that in divers sorts. But the\ncovetousness of Licinius Enceladus, made free, and \n                   of the affairs of Augustus, was cause of all this mischief. For he\nhaving commanded the people to furnish the tribute for every\nmonth, he had put fourteen months in the year for twelve. So\nbeing accused to his master for money ill gotten, although all\nthe world cried \n                   him, yet he found the means to escape\nwell enough. For after he had gotten an infinite mass of gold and\nsilver together, he brought it to Augustus, saying, he had never\nother intention but to take from the Gauls the means to rebel.\nFor all this Augustus withdrew him from thence, and sent Tiberius\nthither to settle all things in good estate again. Almost during\nthese commotions and outrageous dissensions, the Rhetians,\nnear unto the lake of Como, brake into Gaul Cisalpine, and\ntook out of Italy store of booty. They were a people separated\nfrom all others, and so cruel, that, having taken any place from\nthe Romans, they killed all the male children, and further, did\nask their soothsayers \n                   women with child: and if they said\nshe was great with a boy, they presently ran her through, and\nkilled her and the fruit of her womb. \n\nAugustus would not endure these outrages, but sent Drusus the son of Livia against\nthem, who drave them out of Italy, having overcome them in a\nset battle, near under Trent. They say that their women shewed\nthemselves so cruel in this fight, that, their darts failing them,\nthey took their little children by their legs, and did most barbarously\nforce themselves to smite their enemies in the face.\nThose that were driven out of Italy would have entered into\nGaul, but they were repulsed by Tiberius. In the end, these\npeople and their allies were constrained to submit themselves.\n\n\n                   Augustus sent a colony unto Nismes in Languedoc and\nmade them free burgesses of Rome. It is thought that he sent\nanother unto Arles, of the \n                   legion: and one of the second\nunto Orange. Some make report of these colonies in the time\nof Tiberius. M. Agrippa on the other side, he gave order for the\naffairs of Asia, and of all the \n                  , where he behaved himself\n\n\nso well, that all that were friends to the people of Rome were of\nbetter courage than before, and all their enemies so valiantly\nsuppressed, that Augustus was saluted the tenth time sovereign\ncaptain. But Agrippa, after his wonted manner, would have no\ntriumph: which was the cause of the loss of this custom; and\nothers, following his example, were contented from thenceforth\nwith the ornaments of triumph. But of another side, the Pannonians,\nthe \n                  ,\nand those of \n                   rebelling, they\nwere subdued by the lieutenants of Augustus: who builded two\ncities in testimony of his victory against these two last people:\nwhereof Turin (called Augusta Pretoria) was one, and \n                  the other.\n\n\n                   \n                  \nAugustus having pacified Gaul, stayed the invasions of\nthe Germans, and quenched the rebellion of Spain, he left\nDrusus with authority and his army upon the Rhine. and came\nto Rome as Agrippa did out of Asia, and became extremely\nsick of the gout. Lepidus died at the same time, to whom\nAugustus succeeded in the estate of chief bishop, and made\nsumptuous spectacles and sights unto the people. He burnt all\nthe books of divination and prophecy, except those of the\nSibyls: and yet he kept them not all. He reformed the calendar,\nand ordained that there should be no leap-years for twelve\nyears following. He suffered that the \n                  \nmonth, then called Sextilis, should be called Augustus after his name. All that\nyear was spent in plays and pastimes, saving that Augustus\n(having been sick) caused all that he had done in his government\nto be rehearsed before the Senate. He took a review of\nthe senators, and confirmed his nephew Agrippa in the estate of\na tribune for five years more. \n\nBut shortly after, this great person, being returned from a journey out of Pannonia, whither he was\ngone to prevent disorders that were likely to be renewed, he fell\nsick and died, before Augustus could come in time. That was\na marvellous grief unto him: and not knowing now on whom he\nshould bestow his daughter Julia, in the end he chose Tiberius\nhis wife s son, and married them together: but they continued\nnot long in good terms together. From thenceforth Tiberius and\nDrusus dealt almost in all the affairs of war, and Tiberius especially\nafter the death of the other: of whom we shall speak to best\npurpose in the life of Tiberius, yet we will briefly note it here. So\nthen Tiberius went and made war in Pannonia, risen by means\nof the death of Agrippa: yet he made an end of it, killed some\nof them, sold and subjected the rest: and compelled all that\n\n\n\npeople to submit themselves unto the people of Rome. Drusus\non the other side made war in high and low \n                  , and\nbrought the most part of these nations unto some reason: and\nafterwards he returned to Rome: where Augustus held so\n\n                   a hand to bring the Senate to order, that there were\nfew men desired to be of the Senate, and many to the contrary\nthat gave up their offices. But Augustus compelled those that\nwere of age, of quality and sufficiency, and gave order also that\nthe dignity of the tribunes of the people should remain entire:\nsuffering those notwithstanding which had this office, their time\nexpired, to be amongst the senators, or with knights. As for\nthe towns of Asia afflicted with the earthquake, he paid of his\nown to the commonwealth, the yearly tribute which they \n                  .\nAnd for the regard of those which were of his provinces, he\nfreed them from all imposts for six years, and gave them of\nPalestine a great quantity of corn, which sustained great want\nand famine. \nIn the meantime Drusus passed over the Rhine,\nmade war with the Usipites, Sicambrians, Tenchteres, Cattians,\nCherusians, and Suabians, whom he overthrew in divers encounters:\nand especially in a great battle, where were killed a\nvery great number. For these people were gathered together\nwith such a confidence of victory, that they had already made\nagreement amongst themselves for division of the booty. But\nspecially at the last battle, the Cherusians should have the\n\n                  , the Suabians they should have the baggage, and the\nSicambrians the prisoners. And yet to bind themselves more\n\n                   together, \nthey burnt to \n                   of the Romans.\nAnd this was the cause that the battle was so long and cruelly\nfought betwixt them: yet in the end the victory remained to\nDrusus, who gave the prisoners and all the booty to the soldiers,\nmaking the \n                  , baggage, and captives to be sold to them\nthat would offer most All the field, for a great league and a\nhalf of length, was strewed with dead bodies, and they found\nin the enemy's camp great store of iron chains prepared for\nthem for the Romans: howbeit they served for them. Drusus\nset up a token of triumph, and was called imperator of his\ntroops in the field where the battle was pitched. Afterwards he\nbuilt above fifty castles upon the rivers of Meuse, Visurge, and\nof the Rhine. Tiberius on the other side was in Dalmatia\nwhere he brought them under that rose in arms against them.\nThe triumph of Ovatio was decreed to them both, and Augustus\nwas saluted by the Senate imperator or sovereign captain, and\n\n\nthis for the twelfth time. But in these businesses, the war\nwas hot in Thracia, and more than ever before: all the provinces\nbeing in rebellion under the conduct of Bulogaeses, who\nhad killed the king Rhacuspolis, an ally of the people of Rome,\ndriven out his uncle and lieutenant Rhymetalces out of Thracia\ninto Chersonesus. L. Piso, governor of Pamphilia, went against\nthem, and at the first encounter had not the advantage, but in\nthe second he overcame them utterly. Drusus, having made a\nvoyage to Rome, to celebrate the birthday of Augustus in great\nmagnificence, whilst his troops reposed themselves in their garrisons;\nabout the spring he returned into Germany, overcame\nthe Suabians, gave them a king then he invaded the country\nof the Marcomannes, fought with them divers times, killed a\ngreat number of them, and made all the rest subject to the\nRomans. Because of this victory, and of that of Piso, Augustus\nwas called imperator the thirteenth time. \nAlmost in this time he put Proculus to death in prison, one that he loved best of all\nhis bondmen made free: being \n                   of many adulteries.\nHe made the thighs of his secretary Thallus to be broken, for\nthe sum of an hundred crowns which he took for strewing a\nsecret letter. In this meantime Tiberius continued war in\nDalmatia and Pannonia, moved through the great imposts,\nwhereof the people complained: but in the end he subdued\nthem, and built many castles upon the river of Danuby to stay\nthe invasions of the enemies. Piso also in Thracia overcame\nthe Maesians, and Bastarnes, and brought away a great number\nof prisoners, who bit their iron chains for anger, and most impatiently\ndid bear their servitude. Drusus made the Cattians\nsubject also, then he came to Lyons to meet with Augustus:\nfrom whence they both returned together into Italy. They had\na custom also that yearly on the first day of January (though\nAugustus were absent) all the senators, officers of justice, and\nothers of mean estate, brought him new-year's gifts to the\nCapitol: and also every one cast a piece of gold or silver into\nthe lake Curtius, for a vow that they had made to his health.\nHe did bestow all these new-year's gifts to buy many rich\nstatues of the gods, which he set up in all the cross-streets.\n\n\n                   In the five and thirtieth year of his principality, under\nthe consulate of Drusus Nero, and of Quintus Crispinus, Drusus\nhaving subdued a great part of Germany, and preparing to go\nfurther, a vision having the shape of a great woman, that \nspake\nbigger and louder than a man's voice could do, said to him in\n\n\nLatin: \"Go no further:\" which was a sign of his death, the\nwhich followed \n                   after. This young nobleman of\nan excellent hope, being but thirty years old, Augustus had put\nhim in the roll of his heirs, and made an oration in his praise.\nAfterwards all the charge of the wars of Germany was committed\nunto Tiberius. And for Augustus, he, being the same\nyear called for a witness in certain causes, did patiently suffer\nany man to ask him, or refuse him, as he had oftentimes done\nbefore. One day as he spake in full Senate, one of the senators\ntold him: \"I understood nothing\" another, \"I would speak\nagainst it, if I might be heard.\" Another time being weary with\nthe contestations of certain pleaders, he went in choler out of\nhis seat. But some began to say unto him, that it was lawful\nfor senators to speak freely to any matter that came before\nthem: and that no man was ever offended for the replies or\ncontestations of any man.\n\n\n                   Nonius Asprenas, one of his greatest friends, was accused\nby Cassius Severus to have poisoned an hundred and thirty\nbidden guests at a banquet. Augustus did not \n                   him,\nbut let the senators alone, who banished Cassius. An old soldier\nupon complaint being brought before the senators, and in danger\nof his life, besought Augustus to help him. And when he had\ngiven him an advocate to defend him, the soldier opened his\nbreast, and strewing the marks of the wounds which he had\nreceived in the battle of Actium, said unto him: \"But I beseech\nthee, Augustus, consider that I have received these wounds\nhere upon my body for to defend thee, and would put no other\nin my place.\" Augustus, moved with \nthese words, appeared in justice, and pleaded this man's cause, the which he wan. Soon\nafter he was saluted sovereign captain for the fourteenth time;\nbecause of the victories which Tiberius and Sextus Apuleius\nhad obtained in Germany and in Italy. And the authority\nwhich had been given him for ten years over the state of the\ncommonwealth being expired, was continued unto him for ten\nyears following. Then he did greatly enlarge the bounds of the\nterritory of Rome, and having advanced Salustius Crispus (the\nson of the historian) unto the place which Maecenas held, the\nRoman knight, his faithful friend and principal counsellor, deceased\nin those days: and by Tiberius continued to bring the\nGermans under: for the victory \n                   whom, and also for that he\nhad subdued all the people inhabiting \n                   the Alps, the \nSenate had set up a token of triumph, and granted triumph to Tiberius.\n\n\nUnder the second consulate of Claudius Nero, and of Calphurnius\nPiso, Caius and Lucius, the young sons of Augustus,\nwere called young princes, and appointed consuls, although\nthey were but of tender years, and under fourteen years old.\nThis pleased Augustus greatly, though he \n                   to take no\npleasure in it.  Furthermore, he then made an edict touching\nslanderous libels, declaring who should have the hearing of\nthose crimes, and how they should be punished: although he\nhimself cared not much, and patiently suffered they should gibe\nat him; contented to answer, by open defence, unto the reproaches\nand mockeries they made of him. They scattered\nabroad one day in the palace many \n                   of paper of cruel\n\n                   against him. This moved him not at all, neither did he\ntrouble himself much to answer it: but instead of searching it\nOut, he did advise that hereafter they should have an eye upon\nthose, that by little books or epigrams published (under false\nnames) scandal against any man. Tiberius wrote a \n                  \nletter to him one day, to the end he should carry a\n\n                  \nhand upon that: but he sent him these words: \" I pray thee, my\nfriend, let not thy youth overrule thee in this matter, nor be not\nso hot, though I be evil spoken of by some. It is enough if we\ngain this point, that no man can hurt us.\" Afterwards he divided\nthe city of Rome into fourteen regions, and two hundred and\nten streets, and in every of them he established officers to see\nthat all things should be maintained as they ought to be, and\nto report unto the prince any memorable thing that should\nhappen. \nHe provided for the violence of fire, he built up the\ntemples that were burnt or ruined by time: and gave at one\ntime unto the temple of Jupiter Capitoline, for the renewing of\nthe same, sixteen thousand pounds of gold, and of rich and\ncostly pearls, to the sum of twelve hundred thousand crowns.\n\n\n                   Now Caius and Lucius, his young sons, growing apace,\nand Julia his daughter beginning to be too well known for her\nwantonness, Tiberius, that could no longer endure her, nor these\ntwo young princes (and because he would have the Romans a\nlittle long for him), he demanded and obtained leave with\n\n                  ,\nthreatening to kill himself with famine, if they did not\ngrant him: and so went to study at Rhodes. In the meantime\nAugustus provided for the affairs of Istria, divided Italy into\neleven provinces: and, because he \n                  \nthey did envy his greatness, he chose nine Pretorian cohorts for his guard. of the\nwhich he kept three of them in Rome, lodged here and there in\n\n\nhouses, so long as they were in their quarter: and the six others\nwere quartered in the \n                  villages unto it. He also erected new\noffices, to impart to so many men more the honours and charges\nof the commonwealth. At the same time when, before the\nSenate, they did \n                  \nmany crimes unto Aimilius Aelianus, and\namongst other things that he spake ill of Augustus: he, turning\nto the accuser, said unto him as in choler: \"Prove me that, and\nI will make Aelianus know that I have a tongue: for I will say\nmore of him than he hath spoken of me.\" He made no further\ninquiry afterwards, and shewed himself very gentle and courteous\nalso unto Cassius of Padua, a man of a mean estate: who having\nspoken openly at a table, that he lacked no good \n                  \nor courage to kill Augustus: he contented himself to impose this only\npunishment upon him, as to drive him out of Rome. From his\neleventh consulship unto the twelfth, there passed seventeen\nyears: all which time he divers times had refused this charge:\nbut now he demanded it and obtained it. His intention was to\nadvance Caius his little son to great dignity, whom he caused to\nbe proclaimed young prince, and sent him to see the provinces\nand armies, in the title of a proconsul. Then he commanded\nhim to go into Asia, having given him for governors Lollius\nand Sulpitius Quirinus He himself in the mean time remained\nat Rome, where he established extraordinary guards, under\n\n                   to keep\nthieves and \n                   men from offering\nviolence, whilst the armies abroad were far off. The year following,\nCaius having travelled in divers parts of the \n                  ,\nmade peace with Phraates, king of the Parthians, and brought\naway (hostages for assurance thereof) the king's three brethren,\nand all the princes of the blood. The which was \n                   by\nthe means of the queen Thermusa, born in Italy, who being\nsent by Augustus for a gift unto Phraates, he fell so in love\nwith her, and held her in such high estimation, that after she\nhad brought him a son called Phraataces, he received her for\nhis lawful wife. She, being desirous her son should possess the\ncrown, drave the right heirs far off by means of this peace. And\nat the end of certain years Phraataces, who \n                   it, killed\nhis father, and possessed the kingdom. \n\nBut he was not long in quiet possession, for the great lords conspired against him, and\ntook from him his life and crown together. Furthermore Caius\nconquered Armenia, and shortly after Augustus demanded the\nthirteenth consulship, to the end to advance his little son Lucius\nas he had done Caius. He sent him proconsul into Spain, but\n\n\nhe fell sick by the way, and stayed almost a year at Marseilles.\nThough these two brethren were far\nenough off Tiberius, who kept himself as a simple scholar at Rhodes, yet they loved not\nhim greatly, nor he them: for which purpose the \n                  \nserved not much against their mother Julia, banished because of her\nadulteries in the isle of Pandatarie. Shortly after her daughter,\nalso called Julia, married unto Lucius Paulus, was also \n                  \nof the same crime that her mother was: and was\nbanished into another isle of the sea Adriatic, called Tremera\nThis affliction, so near unto him, marvellously grieved Augustus,\nwho could not bear it but in mourning, and devouring himself with\nsorrow. Then all the provinces of the Roman empire being in\npeace, Augustus shut up the third time the temple of Janus: and\nthe King of kings, the Saviour of the world, being born of a virgin\nin Judea, appearing amongst men, he shut up the oracles of all\nthe \n                   gods, as the oracle of Delphes among others was\nconstrained to confess, and never spake afterwards. Wherewith\nAugustus being astonied, caused a great altar to be set up in\nthe Capitol with an inscription, signifying that it was 'The altar\nof the God first born.' \nThe year following, to stay the violent course of great usuries, and to raise up again many families\ndecayed, he put into the exchange two millions and a half of\ngold, that is to say, five and twenty hundred thousand crowns\nand suffered private men to take of it for three years without\ninterest, putting in pawn into the exchequer lands and possessions,\nbeing twice as much worth as the principal: and condemned\nthe usurers that had taken interest more than Julius\nCaesar had ordained, to pay four times as much: and, deducting\nout of the principal that which had been paid over and\nabove the tax of the law, he gave the debtors three years' space\nto pay it, at three equal times from year to year. He made\nprovision also for distributing of corn, and brought it to 200,000\nheads of those that should come to have any of it: and did\nwisely remedy divers discontentments of the people. Shortly\nafter Lucius Caesar, being 16 years of age, died at Marseilles:\nwhich was the cause that, Tiberius being reconciled for some\nother \n                   with Caius, he obtained leave to return from\nRhodes to Rome; with condition (for so was Caius' will) that he\nshould meddle with no affairs of \n                  , and that he should\nremain yet the rest of the year at Rhodes. \n\nAs touching Augustus, he laboured to recreate himself with his friends, and did willingly\nsee learned men, and amongst others T. Livius, that renowned,\n\n\n\nhistorian; the poets, Virgil and Horace; but especially Virgil,\nwho was one of his most familiar friends. Which maketh men\nthink that Ovid committed some great fault, since he was a\nbanished man so long, and that he could obtain no grace,\nthough the greatest men were suitors for him. And yet the\nhistorians say Augustus was not angry, as appeareth by the \n                  of Timagenes the historian: who having dispersed abroad some\npleasant \n                   against Augustus, Livia, and their familiars\n(whereat every one of them laughed, it was so pleasant an\n\n                  ), Augustus was contented to advise him to moderate\nhis tongue from thenceforth, and did only forbid him his house\nand familiarity, suffering him to wax old in the company of\nAsinius Pollio. He did greatly support some also that were\naccused to have sealed a false will, and mingled with the marks\nof condemnation and absolution a third, pardoning all those\nthat it should seem had through ignorance sinned in this fact1.\nOne, being \n                   \n                  \n                   to have killed his father, was\neven at the point to be sewed up in a leather sack, according to\nthe custom, and thrown into the sea: Augustus, desirous\nthis cursed wretch should not be thus handled, put the answer\nin his mouth, in asking of him also: \"Surely I believe thou\nhast not killed thy father?\" The son of Tarius being charged to\nhave conspired against the life of his father, Augustus was sent\nfor into Tarius' house, to counsel him what were best to be\ndone: he gave the father counsel to banish him far off from all\nknowledge. And when Tarius would have made Augustus his\nheir, he refused it, and obtained that the son should be banished\nunto Marseilles; and that during his father's life he should have\na pension to maintain him withal.\n\n\n                   \n                  \nIn the 44 year of the monarchy of Augustus, Tiberius,\nhaving been absent the space of eight years, came again to\nRome, where he lived, and meddled with no matters. But that\n\n                   not long: for in the same year Caius, upon whom Augustus\nprincipally looked, died in Lycia: and some say, that Livia\nknew well enough of what death: for she greatly desired the\nadvancement of her son Tiberius, knowing that Augustus did\nnot greatly love the last son of Agrippa and Julia, by reason of\nthe rudeness of his nature. Augustus took the death of his son\nCaius very \n                  .\nHe made his schoolmaster and \n                  \nservants to be drowned: and furthermore, he disposed\nall the forces of the empire and the legions amongst the provinces\nin commodious places, as well by sea as by land. \n\n                  Afterwards he obtained the tribuneship for Tiberius, more through\nthe \n                   of Livia than otherwise: although in the end\nhe was content to advance him, to make his memory to be so\nmuch the more be \n                  , when they had made proof of his\nsuccessor; whom he knew better than any other, and never\nspake anything well; but he spied always some cross thing in\nhim, of a dangerous nature he had. And yet some judge, that\nAugustus did repute the virtues in Tiberius to be greater than\nhis imperfections; considering also that, in the oration he made,\nhis words tended to this end, that he adopted Tiberius in favour\nof the commonwealth. But before he would declare this adoption,\nhe compelled Tiberius to adopt his nephew Germanicus\nthe son of Drusus, and he adopted (with Tiberius) Agrippa\nPosthumus, the son of M. Agrippa. Then to prevent the \n                  of some of the chiefest of Rome, he made Tiberius to be\nchosen tribune for ten years following. That was the cause that\nin Rome they began to speak well of Tiberius, whom they saw,\nby that means somewhat stepped into Augustus' place, so soon\nas he should happen to die. Furthermore, at the instance of\nthe people of Rome and Tiberius himself, Augustus did \n                   the banishment of his daughter Julia: \nhowbeit for no entreaty he would ever \n                  her again.\n\nSo, after the decease of\nAugustus, she was destitute of all help, and Tiberius made her\ndie for want, in an unknown place.\n\n\n                   The year following, Valerius Messala, and C. Cinna,\n\n                   of the great Pompey, were elected consuls. Cinna,\nthat took part with his \n                  , was taken prisoner, and brought\nto Augustus, who gave him life and advanced him. This notwithstanding,\nhe was afterwards attainted and \n                   to\nhave conspired against the life of Augustus, whom through the\ncounsel of Livia he sent for into his chamber, and gently rebuked\nhim for all the good deeds he had done to him: pardoned\nhim this last offence, and afterwards raised him to the dignity\nof a consul, being sorry that he durst not demand it.\nAfter that,\nCinna became his faithful friend and servant, and bequeathed\nall his goods by will unto Augustus, against whom never any man\nconspired \n                  . His lieutenants in Africa obtained some victories,\nand Tiberius continued the war in Germany, from whence\nhe oftentimes returned to Rome, to keep himself in Augustus'\ngood favour. Who having limited the pay, recompence,\n\n                  ,\nand time that the soldiers should have, he procured\nfor some time the good of the commonwealth, which had continued\n\n\nlonger in prosperity, if his successors had better entertained\nmilitary discipline. Afterwards, to resist the mutinies of\nthe people by reason of famine, he established \nin all the places of Rome, and drave out a multitude of unprofitable\nmouths. And when corn came again to bear the ordinary\nprice, he was about to abolish the distribution of corn which the\ncommonwealth made: because that the people, trusting unto\nthat, made no reckoning to plough their lands. At the same time\nmany towns in diverse provinces were enclined to rebel, which\ncaused the Senate to make a decree, that the governors of\nprovinces should command two years one after another, and\nshould not depart thence till their successors were arrived.\n\nThe Illyrians also began to rise, but they were suppressed\nimmediately by Valerius Messalinus. \n                   Germany, all were\nsubject under the name of the Romans, except the Marcomannes,\nand their king Maroboduus, a valiant and wise man, that kept\nhimself and his people in good discipline, having always an\narmy ready of threescore and ten thousand footmen, and four\nthousand horse, all the which he trained end, put in readiness\nagainst his neighbours, to defend him the better against the\nRomans, if they came to assail him. Tiberius prepared himself\nwith twelve legions to make war with him; but being constrained\nto go against the Illyrians, he made agreement with\nMaroboduus, that sought peace and quietness; and so marched\nwhere necessity called him. For the Illyrians, to the number of\neight hundred thousand men and upwards, rose in \n\n                   all\nat an instant, and mustered up in short time, with such order\nin their affairs and warlike exploits, that they possessed and\nbrought in subjection almost all Macedon, and put Augustus\ninto a marvellous perplexity, because they prepared themselves\nto come into Italy. Hereupon Tiberius is chosen to go against\nthem, the which he did with so good direction and warlike\njudgment, that he dispersed their army. \n\nBut now, concerning the country of Thracia, there the army of the Romans was put\nto flight: yet taking heart again, they returned to meet with\ntheir enemies, and obtained an honourable victory. For which\ncause they called Augustus Imperator or sovereign captain the\nsixteenth time. The Illyrians made head again better than\nbefore under the \n                  \nof Bato Desidiates; they made violent and strange invasions, and Tiberius never came against them.\nWhereupon Augustus, conceiving an evil opinion, despatched\nGermanicus, the son of Drusus, to go into Illyria with a complete \n\n\narmy. \nOn the other side, Agrippa Posthumus shewed himself\nso insolent, and committed so many follies, that Augustus\ncould no longer endure them, and therefore he disavowed and\ndisinherited him, confiscated his goods, and confined him to\nSurrentum: where being more audacious than before, he banished\nhim into the isle of Planasia, near unto Corsica: and\ncaused the Senate to make an ordinance that he should remain\nthere till his death. By this means every man began to \n                  \nTiberius, who was also declared the son and colleague of\nAugustus by decree of the Senate, who committed unto him all\nthe armies and provinces of the empire. Livia his mother did\nhelp him greatly in all these affairs. Furthermore, he would not\nstir out of Illyria until he had made an end of this war, which\ncontinued three whole years.\n\n\n                    \n                  \nNow at the arrival of Germanicus, the chieftains of the\nIllyrians came suddenly to assail the camp of the Romans: who,\nfeigning to be afraid, staid till the enemy came to charge them\nin disorder. Then they came out with fury against them, killed\na great number of them, and made the rest to fly. Germanicus\n\n                   another battle against the Dalmatians, and pursuing his\nvictory, he followed them so near at the heels, that they submitted\nthemselves and demanded peace. By reason whereof they\ngave Augustus the name of  the eighteenth time.\nBato Desidiates\ncame to salute Tiberius set in his tribunal\nchair, without holding down his head, or any way \n                  \nhimself: and being asked why, after so many battles lost, he\ndid yet rebel again? he answered boldly again, that the Romans\nwere the cause of it: who, instead of shepherds, had sent them\nwolves to keep their flock. Peace was granted unto the Dalmatians\nupon certain conditions. And as for the Breucians which\ncontinued their war, they were overthrown in many encounters,\nand at the length brought to subjection by Plautius Silvanus,\nwho triumphed. Their king Bato Beucrus had betrayed and\ndelivered unto the Romans another great captain of the Illyrians \ncalled Pinnetes: and afterwards he was delivered himself\nby his own men unto Bato Desidiates, who killed him with his\nown hand: and then fortified himself in Dalmatia, where having\nmade head almost a year and a half against the armies of Tiberius\nand Germanicus, he won and lost many battles: at the last,\nbeing able to hold out no longer, he sent his son to demand\npeace of Tiberius, promising to yield himself and his into the\nhands of Augustus. He obtained safe conduct, and came by\n\n\n\nnight unto Tiberius' camp: who gave him very gracious entertainment,\nand many rich presents. Afterwards he made him be\nbrought to Ravenna, and was also gently used, because that in\nan encounter where he was \n                  , and in danger of his life,\nhe had given him means to escape and save himself And because\nof the divers victories obtained by Germanicus and Tiberius,\nAugustus was saluted for the nineteenth and twentieth\ntime  or sovereign captain. \n                   the Pannonians,\ntheir young men, that had so many times threatened Italy, were\nconstrained to bring all their arms together on a heap, as they\nwere commanded, and to fall on their knees before Tiberius to\ndemand peace of him. He received them into grace, and sent\nthem home to their houses, disposing his garrisons in strong\nplaces, under the charge of Marcus Lepidus.\nThe glory of Tiberius\nwas yet more noble, and the anguishes of Augustus increased,\nby the overthrow of Quintilius Varus: who, being gone\nto assail Arminius, prince of the Cherussians, was enclosed in\n\n                  , and utterly overthrown with three Roman legions,\nthat were slain in the place: and for himself, fearing to fall alive\ninto the hands of the Cherussians, he killed himself with his\nown hand. The victors did never so cruelly handle the Romans\nas those whom they might know were common counsellers and\npleaders. For at the beginning, when Varus came to command\ntheir country, where they knew not what \n                  meant, he\npersuaded himself he should tame them well enough, using the\nsame form and order of process there amongst them, as they\ndid at Rome. So he had a judgment-seat, and all matters were\npleaded before him. Some of them amongst the rest, being\nvery subtle, seemed to esteem much this pleading; and to bring\nhim asleep, they \n                  \nmoved occasion of process and suit one against the other and then they went before him, and by Romans\nthemselves, whose tongues they borrowed, they demanded\njustice. \nThen they rejoiced not a little when they could catch\nany of these counsellers: for they put out the eyes of some of\nthem, cut off the hands of others of them; and they say that\nthey cut out the tongue of one, and afterwards sewed up his\nmouth; and he that held the tongue in his hand said unto him:\n\"O viper, at the last yet thou wilt \n                   whistling.\" Augustus\nwas so astonied at this loss, that at times he would beat his\nhead against the wall, crying our, \"Varus, give me my legions.\"\nCertain years after, Germanicus buried the bones of the Romans\nthat were killed in this overthrow. The year following\n\n\nTiberius returned into Germany, and, \n                   the passages of\nthe Rhine, Augustus \n                   the slaves enfranchised,\nwhich caused afterwards great confusions and seditions\nin the Roman army. \n\nIn all these stirs, two men of no worth,\ncalled Andasius and Epicadus, complotted to take away Julia,\nthe daughter of Augustus, and Agrippa Posthumus, from the\npiaces where they were, and to bring them to some legions, to i\nalter the \n                  .\nBut they were soon discovered, and punished\nfor their rashness. Some others also committed the like \n                  \nenterprises, but they vanished away without any effect.\n\n\n                   \n                  Furthermore Augustus, being now old and broken, began\nto leave all great companies, \n                  \nhis guards, and sent them to garrisons far off, to the end they should not go about to\nmake any change. He gave commandment that the Gauls and\nGermans should depart the city by a day prefixed. In the\nmeantime Tiberius, having divided his army into four parts,\nentered into Germany, about five and twenty leagues into the\ncountry beyond the Rhine, and put all to fire and blood: then\nhe retired, fearing some encounter of Varus. Touching Augustus,\nhe qualified some strict laws against the unmarried, the\ngifts of the husband to the wife, the banquets and suits: he did\nforbid the \n                  \nto answer the vain question of those, that\nwould know how long they should live: and he suffered the\nknights (if they were challenged) to fight \n                  .\nGermanicus being returned to Rome, obtained the consulship, and\nTiberius triumphed of8 the Illyrians, Pannonians, Dalmatians,\nand Germans: followed with his lieutenant Germanicus, Vibius\nPosthumus, Plautius Silvanus, and Marcus Lepidus, with triumphing\nrobes. But before he went up to the Capitol, he went out\nof his \n                   and fell down on his knees before Augustus.\n\nThen he made a dinner for all the people, and had a thousand\ntables set up for them, and gave to every one of them seven I\ncrowns and a half. Under the consulship of C Silius and of\nMunatius Plancus, Augustus, having obtained ten years with\nTiberius to provide for the affairs of the commonwealth, to the\nend to quench many false rumours, about sixteen months before\nhis death, he made his will, and gave it to the Vestal virgins to\nkeep. Because his sickness kept him from coming to the\nSenate, he prayed the senators to think of some means to \n                  \nthe men of war. Which they having well considered, found\nno better means than that which he himself had found out, to\nwit, of the twentieth part of the inheritances: and they all\n\n\n\nagreed unto it. The next year following, he went (as they say)\nto see Agrippa in his isle of Planasia, the which troubled Livia\nmuch, for she knew what was past. \nAt the same time he and\nTiberius took muster of the Roman citizens; and shortly after\nhe fell sick, whereof they recite many causes. But thereupon he\nwent into the country unto some places of pleasure, where he\nmended a little, and passed the time away prettily merry, carrying\nTiberius with him, whom he would have brought on his way\nto Benevent, from whence he went into Illyria. At his return\nhis sickness increased, that he was fain to stay at Nola, and sent\nfor Tiberius and talked with him a long time very privately, and\nafter that did never anything of importance: although the historians\ndo not agree whether Tiberius was come before his\ndeparture or not. For Livia had set \n                   in the house he lay\nsick in, and on the highways, giving it out abroad that Augustus\nwas well: and on the other side sending messages upon\nmessages unto Tiberius, fame spreading it abroad that Augustus\nwas dead, and that Tiberius held his place. Augustus, being at\nthe point to give up the ghost, made himself to be combed, and\nspeaking to his friends, asked if nobody made any noise without.\nSo he exhorted them to rejoice with him, for that he had\nso happily played the comedy of this human life. Then having\nsent them all out of his chamber, he asked if Livia, Drusus'\ndaughter, were in health: and so, embracing his wife, said these\nwords unto her: \" Farewell, Livia, behave thyself weld, and remember\nour marriage :\" and suddenly went away, making a\nsweet end, which he always desired, as often as he heard talk of\nthose that died quietly. \n\nHe died in the same town, and in the\nsame chamber that his father Octavius died in, and lived near\nunto the age of threescore and sixteen years.\n\n\n                   His corpse being brought to Rome, the Vestal virgins\nbrought out his will and testament, by the which he appointed\nTiberius his heir, and gave him three parts of his goods, and\nhis wife Livia the fourth part. \n\nFurthermore he gave to the people\nof Rome twelve hundred and fifty thousand crowns: to the\nfive and thirty tribes, thirteen hundred, seven and thirty thousand,\nfive hundred crowns: to every one of the Pretorian soldiers\ntwenty-five crowns, to those of the town twelve crowns and a\nhalf. There were other legacies to be paid within a year, and\nhe said that, all his legacies performed, he left his heirs four\nmillions of gold. Within twenty years before his death, he \ndid inherit of his friends' goods which had made him \ntheir heir,\n\n\nabout thirty-five millions of gold: howbeit that he had spent all\nthat, with two patrimonies of his own, for maintenance of the\ncommonwealth. With his testament there were three little\n\n                   or codicils,\nthe \n                   strewing what\nhe \n                  \nat his \n                  .\nThe second was a \n                   of all his actions,\nwhich he commanded should be graven in copper tables before\nhis tomb. The third contained the state of his revenue, and of\nthe principal affairs of the empire. He had added to them also\nthe names of the enfranchised bondmen and of the slaves,\nwhom they might bring to account, and therewith he advised\nthem to keep the limits of the empire which they had at that\ntime. They carried him with great pomp into the field of Mars,\nwhere he was reduced into ashes, which they closed up in his\nsepulchre, built in his sixth consulship; after all these ceremonies\nthe Senate appointed him a temple and divine honours,\nand he was placed in rank with the gods. To make his honour\nyet greater, one Numerius Atticus, that had been praetor, a man\nof great authority in Rome, was enticed by Livia, who gave him\nfive and twenty thousand crowns, to swear before all the people,\nthat he saw Augustus carried up into heaven. \n\nAfter his death, many speeches were diversely spoken of his life: some reproving\nhim as much as others commended him. But his successor\nmade him oftentimes to be lamented. And so he was wont to\nsay of Tiberius, \"that he should leave to the Romans, in succession\nof the empire, a successor that never consulted twice of\none thing.\" And as he was a \n                   prince in all his enterprises,\nand that by his lieutenants had done an infinite number\nof worthy exploits against the enemies of the empire; so, in his\nlife amongst his friends, he shewed himself very gracious, pleasant,\nand well disposed in company: being learned, eloquent,\nand \n                  \nin all his talk.

For\nAethra was the daughter of Pitheus, and Alcmena (the mother\nof Hercules) was the daughter of Lysidices, the which was half\nsister to Pitheus, both children of Pelops and of his wife Hippodamia\nSo he thought he should be utterly shamed and disgraced,\nthat Hercules, travelling through the world in that sort,\n\ndid seek out those wicked thieves, to rid both sea and land of\nthem: and that he, far otherwise, should fly occasion that might\nbe offered him, to fight with them that he should meet on his\nway....  \n\nWith this determination, Theseus holdeth on his purposed\njourney, with intent to hurt no man, yet to defend himself,\nand to be revenged of those which would take upon them to\nassault him.

And so going on further, in the straits \nof Peloponnesus he killed another, called Sinnis, surnamed Pityocamtes,\nthat is to say, a wreather or bower of pine-apple trees: whom he put\nto death in that \n                  \ncruel manner that Sinnis had slain many other travellers before.\nNot that he had experience thereof, by any former practice or\nexercise: but only to shew that clean strength could do more than\neither art or exercise. This Sinnis had a goodly fair daughter called Perigouna, \nwhich fled away when she saw her father slain: whom he followed and sought\nall about. But she had hidden herself in a grove full of certain\nkinds of wild pricking rushes called , and wild\n\n                  ,\nwhich she simply like a child intreated to hide her, as if they\nhad heard, and had sense to understand her: promising them\nwith an oath, that if they saved her from being found, she would\nnever cut them down, nor burn them. But Theseus funding\nher, called her, and sware by his faith he would use her gently,\nand do her no hurt, nor displeasure at all. Upon which promise\nshe came out of the bush, and bare unto him a goodly boy,\nwhich was called Menalippus. Afterwards Theseus married her\nunto one Deioneus, the son of Euritus the Oechalian. Of this\nMenalippus the son of Theseus, came Ioxus: the which with\nOrnytus brought men into the country of Caria, where he built\nthe city of Ioxides. And. hereof cometh that old ancient ceremony,\nobserved yet unto this day by those of Ioxides, never\n\nto burn the briars of wild sperage, nor the , but they have\nthem in some honour and reverence....\n\n\n                   It is supposed he arrived in the city of Athens the eighth\nday of the month of June, which then they called Cronius. He\nfound the commonwealth turmoiled with seditions, factions, and\ndivisions, and particularly the house of Aegeus in very ill teens\nalso, because that Medea (being banished out of the city of\nCorinth) was come to dwell in Athens, and remained with\nAegeus...But when she heard tell that Theseus \nwas come, before that the good king Aegeus (who was now become\nold, suspicious, and afraid of sedition, by reason of the great factions\nwithin the city at that time) knew what he was, she persuaded\nhim to poison him at a feast which they would make him as a\nstranger that passed by. Theseus failed not to go to this pre\npared feast whereunto he was bidden, but yet thought it not\ngood to disclose himself. And the rather to give Aegeus \n\n                  \n and \n                   to know\n him, when they brought the meat to the board, he drew out his\n sword as though he would have cut withal, and shewed it unto him.\n Aegeus seeing it, knew it straight, and forthwith overthrew\n the cup with poison which was prepared for him: and after he\n had enquired of him and asked things, he embraced him as his\n son. Afterwards in the common assembly of the inhabitants of \n the city, he declared how he avowed him for his son. Then all\n the people received him with exceeding joy, for the renown of\n his valiantness and manhood....\n\n\n                   \n                  Shortly after this exploit, there came certain of king\nMinos' ambassadors out of Creta, to ask a tribute, being now\nthe third time that it was demanded; which the Athenians\npaid for this cause. Androgeus, the eldest son of king Minos,\nwas slain by treason within the country of Attica: for which\ncause Minos, pursuing the revenge of his death, made very hot\nand sharp wars upon the Athenians, and did them great hurt.\nBut besides all this, the gods did sharply punish and scourge\nall the country, as well with barrenness and famine as also with\nplague and other mischiefs, even to the drying up of their rivers.\nThe Athenians perceiving these sore troubles and plagues, ran\nto the oracle of Apollo, who answered them that they should\nappease Minos, and when they had made their peace with him,\nthat then the wrath of the gods would cease against them, and\ntheir troubles should have an end. Whereupon the Athenians\nsent immediately unto him, and intreated him for peace: which\nhe granted them, with condition that they should be bound to\n\nsend him yearly, into Creta, seven young boys and as many\nyoung girls. Now thus far all the historiographers do very well\nagree, but in the rest not. And they which seem furthest off\nfrom the \n                  , do declare, that when these young boys were\ndelivered in Creta, they caused them to be devoured by the\nMinotaur within the labyrinth: or else that they were shut\nwithin this labyrinth, wandering up and down, and could find\nno place to get out, until such time as they died, even famished\nfor hunger. And this Minotaur, as Euripides the poet saith,\nwas\n\n\n\n                  \n                  But Philochorus writeth, that the Cretans do not confess that,\nbut say that this labyrinth was a \n                   or prison, in the which\nthey had no other hurt, saving that they which were kept there\nunder lock and key could not fly nor start away: and that Minos\nhad, in memory of his son Androgeus, instituted games and plays\nof \n                  , where he gave unto them that wan the victory those\nyoung children of Athens, the which in the meantime notwithstanding\nwere carefully kept and looked unto in the prison of\nthe labyrinth: and that at the first games that were kept, one\nof the king's captains called Taurus, who was in best credit\nwith his master, wan the \n                  . This Taurus was a churlish\nand \n                   man of \n                  , and very hard and\ncruel to these children of Athens. And to verify the same, the\nphilosopher Aristotle himself, speaking of the commonwealth of\nthe Bottieians, declareth very well, that he never thought that\nMinos did at any time cause the children of Athens to be put to\ndeath: but saith, that they poorly toiled in Creta, even to\ncrooked age, earning their living by true and painful service....\n\n\n                  The time now being come about for payment of the third\ntribute, when they came to compel the fathers which had\nchildren not yet married, to give them to be put forth to take\ntheir chance and lot: the citizens of Athens began to murmur\nagainst Aegeus, alleging for their \n                  , that he, w ho only was\nthe cause of all this evil, was only alone exempted from this\ngrief. And that, to bring the government of the realm to fall\ninto the hands of a stranger, he cared not though they were\nbereft of all their natural children, and were unnaturally compelled\nto leave and forsake them. These just sorrows and complaints\nof the fathers whose children were taken from them did\npierce the heart of Theseus, who, willing to yield to reason, and\n\nto run the selfsame fortune as the citizens did, willingly offered\nhimself to be sent thither, \n                   his\nhap or adventure. For which, the citizens greatly esteemed of\nhis courage and honourable disposition, and dearly loved him\nfor the good affection he seemed to bear unto the commonalty.\nBut Aegeus having used many reasons and persuasions to cause\nhim to turn and stay from his purpose, and perceiving in the\nend there was no remedy but he would go, he then drew lots\nfor the children which should go with him. Hellanicus notwithstanding\ndoth write, that they were not those of the city\nwhich drew lots for the children they should send, but that\nMinos himself went thither in person, and did choose them, as\nhe chose Theseus the first, upon condition agreed between\nthem: that is to wit, that the Athenians should furnish them\nwith a ship, and that the children should ship and embark with\nhim, carrying no weapons of war: and that after the death of\nthe Minotaur this tribute should cease. Now before that time,\nthere was never any hope of return, nor of safety of their children;\ntherefore the Athenians always sent a ship to convey their\nchildren, with a black sail, in token of assured loss. Nevertheless\nTheseus putting his father in good hope of him, being of a\ngood courage, and promising boldly that he would set upon this\nMinotaur, Aegeus gave unto the master of the ship a white sail,\ncommanding him that at his return he should put out the white\nsail if his son had escaped: if not, that then he should set up\nthe black sail, to shew him afar off his unlucky and unfortunate\nchance. Simonides notwithstanding cloth say, that this sail\nwhich Aegeus gave to the master, was not white, but red, dyed\nin grain, and of the colour of scarlet, and that he gave it him to\nsignify afar off their delivery and safety. This master was\ncalled Phereclus Amarsiadas, as Simonides saith. But Philochorus\nwriteth, that Scirus the Salaminian gave to Theseus a\nmaster called Nausitheus, and another mariner to tackle the\nsails, who was called Phaeas: because the Athenians at that\ntime were not greatly practiced to the sea. And this did Scirus,\nfor that one of the children on whom the lot fell was his nephew:\nand thus much the chapels do testify, which Theseus built afterwards\nin honour of Nausitheus and of Phaeas, in the village of\nPhalerus, joining to the temple of Scirus. And it is said moreover,\nthat the feast which they call Cybernesia, that is to say,\nthe feast of patrons of the ships, is celebrated in honour of\nthem. \n\n\n                  Now after the lots were drawn, Theseus taking with\n\nhim the children allotted for the tribute, went from the palace\nto the temple called Delphinion, to offer up to Apollo, for him\nand for them, an offering of supplication, which they call \n:\nwhich was an olive bough hallowed, wreathed about with\nwhite wool. After he had made his prayer, he went down to\nthe sea-side to embark, the sixth day of the month of March:\non which day at this present time they do send their young girls\nto the same temple of Delphinion, there to make their prayers\nand petitions to the gods. But some say, that the oracle of\nApollo in the city of Delphes had answered him, that he should\ntake Venus for his guide, and that he should call upon her to\nconduct him in his voyage: for which cause he did sacrifice a\ngoat unto her upon the sea-side, which was found suddenly\nturned into a ram, and that therefore they surnamed this goddess\nEpitragia, as one would say, the goddess of the ram. \n\n                  Furthermore,\nafter he was arrived in Creta, he slew there the Minotaur\n(as the most part of ancient authors do write) by the\nmeans and help of Ariadne: who being fallen in \n                   with\nhim, did give him a clue of thread, by the help whereof she\ntaught him, how he might easily wind out of the turnings and\n\n                   of the labyrinth. And they say, that having killed this\nMinotaur, he returned back again the same way he went, bringing\nwith him those other young children of Athens, whom with\nAriadne also he carried afterwards away. Pherecides saith\nmoreover, that he brake the keels or bottoms of all the ships of\nCreta, because they should not suddenly set out after them.\nAnd Demon writeth, that Taurus (the captain of Minos) was\nkilled in fight by Theseus, even in the very haven-mouth, as\nthey were ready to ship away and \n                   up sail. Yet Philochorus\nreporteth, that king Minos having set up the games, as\nhe was wont to do yearly in the honour and memory of his son,\nevery one began to envy captain Taurus, because they ever\nlooked that he should carry away the game and victory, as he\nhad done other years before; over and above that, his authority\ngot him much ill will and envy, because he was proud and\nstately, and had in suspicion that he was \n                   Queen\nPasiphae. Wherefore when Theseus required that he might encounter\nwith Taurus, Minos easily granted it. And being a\nsolemn custom in Creta, that the women should be present to\nsee those open sports and sights, Ariadne, being at these games\namongst the rest, fell further in love with Theseus, seeing him\nso goodly a person, so strong, and invincible in wrestling, that\n\nhe far exceeded all that wrestled there that day. King Minos\nwas so glad that he had taken away the honour from captain\nTaurus, that he sent him home \n                   and free into his country,\nrendering to him all the other prisoners of Athens: and for his\nsake clearly released and forgave the city of Athens the tribute,\nwhich they should have paid him yearly....\n\n \n                  Afterwards when all his ships were ready, and rigged out,\nhe took sea before the Cretans had any knowledge of it: insomuch\nas when they saw them afar off, they did take them for the\nbarks of their friends. Theseus landed without resistance, and\ntook the haven. Then having Daedalus, and other banished\nCretans for guides, he entered the city \n                   of Gnosus, where he\nslew Deucalion in a fight before the gates of the labyrinth, with\nall his guard and officers about him. By this means the kingdom\nof Creta fell by inheritance into the hands of his sister\nAriadne. Theseus made league with her, and carried away the\nyoung children of Athens which were kept as hostages, and concluded\npeace and amity between the Athenians and the Cretans:\nwho promised and sware, they would never make wars against\nthem. \n\nThey report many other things also touching this matter,\nand specially of Ariadne: but there is no \n                   nor certainty\nin it. For some say, that Ariadne hung herself for sorrow,\nwhen she saw that Theseus had cast her off. Other write, that\nshe was transported by mariners into the \n                   4 of Naxos, where\nshe was married unto Oenarus the priest of Bacchus: and they\nthink that Theseus left her, because he was in love with another,\nas by these verses should appear:\n\n\n\n                   \n                  But when they drew near to the coast of Attica, they\nwere so joyful, he and his \n                  , that they forget to set up their\nwhite sail, by which they should have given knowledge of their\nhealth and safety unto Aegeus. Who seeing the black sail afar\noff, being out of all hope ever more to see his son again, took\nsuch a grief at his heart, that he threw himself headlong from\nthe top of a cliff, and killed himself. So soon as Theseus was\narrived at the port named Phalerus, he performed the sacrifices\nwhich he had vowed to the gods at his departure: and sent an\nherald of his before unto the city, to carry news of his safe arrival.\nThe herald found many of the city mourning the death of\nKing Aegeus. Many other received him with great joy, as may\nbe supposed. They would have crowned him also with a garland\n\nof flowers, for that he had brought so good tidings, that the\nchildren of the city were returned in safety. The herald was\ncontent to take the garland, yet would he not in any wise put it\non his head, but did wind it about his herald's rod he bare in\nhis hand, and so returned forthwith to the sea, where Theseus\nmade his sacrifices. Who perceiving they were not yet done,\ndid refuse to enter into the temple, and stayed \n                   troubling\nof the sacrifices. Afterwards, all ceremonies finished, he\nwent in and told him the news of his father's death. Then he\nand his company, mourning for sorrow, hasted with speed towards\nthe city....\n\n\n                   Furthermore, after the death of his father Aegeus, he undertook\na marvellous great enterprise. For he brought all the\ninhabitants of the whole province of Attica to be within the city\nof Athens, and made them all one corporation, which were before\ndispersed into divers villages, and by reason thereof were\nvery hard to be assembled together, when occasion was offered\nto establish any order concerning the common state. Many\ntimes also they were at variance together and \n                  , making\nwars one upon another. But Theseus took the pains to go\nfrom village to village, and from family to family, to let them\nunderstand the reasons why they should consent unto it. So he\nfound the poor people and private men ready to obey and follow\nhis will, but the rich, and such as had authority in every village,\nall against it. Nevertheless he wan them, promising that it\nshould be a commonwealth, and not subject to the power of any\nsole prince, but rather a popular state. In which he would only\nreserve to himself the charge of the wars, and the preservation\nof the laws: for the rest, he was content that every citizen, in all\nand for all; should bear a like sway and authority. So there\nwere some that willingly granted thereto. \n                   who had no\nliking thereof, yielded notwithstanding for fear of his displeasure\nand power, which then was very great. So they thought it better\nto consent with good will unto that he required, than to\ntarry his forcible compulsion. Then he caused all the places\nu here justice was ministered, and all their halls of assembly, to\nbe overthrown and pulled down. He removed straight all\njudges and officers, and built a town-house, and a council-hall,\nin the place where the city now standeth, which the Athenians\ncall , but he called the whole corporation of then, Athens.\nAfterwards he instituted the great feast and common sacrifice\nfor all the country of Attica, which they call Panathenaea.\n\nThen he ordained another feast also upon the sixteenth day of\nthe month of June, for all strangers which should come to dwell\nin Athens, which was called Metoecia, and is kept even to this\nday. That done, he gave over his regal power according to his\npromise, and began to set up an estate or policy of a commonwealth,\nbeginning first with the service of the gods....\n\n\n                  \n                  Touching the voyage he made by the sea Major, Philochorus,\nand some other hold opinion, that he went thither with\nHercules against the Amazons: and that to honour his valiantness,\nHercules gave him Antiopa the Amazon. But the more\npart of the other historiographers, namely, Hellanicus, Pherecides,\nand Herodotus, do write, that Theseus went thither alone,\nafter Hercules' voyage, and that he took this Amazon prisoner;\nwhich is likeliest to be true. For we do not find that any other\nwho went this Journey with him, had taken any Amazon prisoner\nbesides himself. Bion also the historiographer, this notwithstanding, \nsaith, that he brought her away by deceit and stealth.\nFor the Amazons (saith he) naturally loving men, did not fly at\nall when they saw them land in their country, but sent them\npresents, and that Theseus enticed her to come into his ship,\nwho brought him a present: and so soon as she was aboard, he\n\n                   his sail, and so carried her away. Another historiographer\nMenecrates, who wrote the history of the city of Nicea\nin the country of Bithynia, saith: that Theseus having this Amazon\nAntiopa with him, remained a certain time upon those\ncoasts, and that amongst other he had in his company three\nyounger brethren of Athens, Euneus, Thoas, and Solois. This\nlast, Solois, was marvellousIy in love with Antiopa, and never\n\n                   it to any of his other companions, saving unto one\nwith whom he was most familiar, and whom he trusted best: so\nthat he reported this matter unto Antiopa. But she utterly rejected\nhis suit, though otherwise she handled it wisely and\ncourteously, and did not complain to Theseus of him. Howbeit\nthe young man, despairing to enjoy his love, took it so \n                  ,\nthat desperately he leaped into the river' and drowned himself.\nWhich when Theseus \n                  , and the cause also that\nbrought him to this desperation and end, he was very sorry,\nand angry also. Whereupon he remembered a certain oracle\nof Pythia, by whom he was commanded to build a city in that\nplace in a strange country, where he should be most sorry, and\nthat he should leave some that were about him at that time, to\ngovern the same. For this cause therefore he built a city in\n\n\nthat place, which he named Pythopolis, because he built it only\nby the commandment of the nun Pythia He called the river,\nin the which the young man was drowned, Solois, in memory of\nhim: and left his two brethren for his deputies and as governors\nof this new city, with another gentleman of Athens, called\nHermus....\n\n\n                  \n                  Now hear what was the occasion of the wars of the Amazons,\nwhich me thinks was not a matter of small moment, nor\nan enterprise of a woman. For they had not placed their camp\nwithin the very city of Athens, nor had not fought in the very\nplace itself (called Pnyce) adjoining to the temple of the Muses,\nif they had not first conquered or subdued all the country thereabouts:\nneither had they all come at the first, so valiantly to\nassail the city of Athens. Now, whether they came by land\nfrom so far a country, or that they passed over an arm of the\nsea, which is called Bosphorus Cimmericus, being frozen as\nHellanicus saith: it is hardly to be credited. But that they'\ncamped within the precinct of the very city itself, the names of\nthe places which continue yet to this present day do witness it,\nand the graves also of the women which died there. But so it\nis, that both armies lay a great time one in the face of the other,\nere they came to battle. Howbeit at the length Theseus, having\nfirst made sacrifice unto Fear the goddess, according to the'\ncounsel of a prophecy he had received, he gave them battle in\nthe month of August, on the same day in the which the Athenians\ndo even at this present solemnise the feast which they\ncall Boedromia. But Clidemus the historiographer, desirous\nparticularly to write all the circumstances of this encounter,;\nsaith, that the left point of their battle bent towards the place\nwhich they call Amazonion: and that the right point marched\nby the side of Chrysa, even to the place which is called Pnyce,\nupon which the Athenians, coming towards the temple of the\nMuses, did first give their charge. And for proof that this is\ntrue, the graves of the women which died in the first encounter,\nare found yet in the great street which goeth towards the gate\n, near unto the chapel of the little god Chalcodus. And\nthe Athenians (saith he) were in this place repulsed by the\nAmazons, even to the place where the images of Eumenides are,\nthat is to say, of the furies. But on the other side also, the \nAthenians, coming towards the quarters of Palladium, Ardettus, \nand Lucium, \n                   back their right point even to within their \ncamp, and slew a great number of them. Afterwards, at the \n\n\nend of four months, peace was taken between them by means\nof one of the women called Hippolyta. For this historiographer\ncalleth the Amazon which Theseus married, Hippolyta, and not\nAntiopa. Nevertheless, some say that she was slain (fighting\non Theseus' side) with a dart, by another called Molpadia. In\nmemory whereof, the pillar which is joined to the temple of the\nOlympian ground was set up in her honour. We are not to\nmarvel, if the history of things so ancient be found so diversely\nwritten....\n\n\n                  \n                  Albeit in his time other princes of Greece had done\nmany goodly and notable exploits in the wars, yet Herodotus is\nof opinion, that Theseus was never in any one of them, saying\nthat he was at the battle of the Lapithae against the Centauri.\nOthers say, to the contrary, that he was at the Journey of \n                  \n with Jason, and that he did help Meleager to kill the\nwild boar of Calydonia: from whence (as they say) this proverb\ncame, 'Not without Theseus;' meaning that such a thing was\nnot done without great help of another.  Howbeit, it is certain\nthat Theseus self did many famous acts without aid of any man\nand that, for his valiantness, this proverb came in use, which is\nspoken 'This is another Theseus.' Also he did help Adrastus,\nking of the Argives, to recover the bodies of those that were\nslain in the battle before the city of Thebes. Howbeit, it was\nnot, as the poet Euripides saith, by force of arms, after he had\novercome the Thebans in battle, but it was by \n                  .\nAnd thus the greatest number of the most ancient writers do\ndeclare it. Furthermore, Philochorus writeth that this was the\nvery first treaty that ever was made to recover the dead bodies\nslain in battle. Nevertheless, we read in the histories and\n\n                   of Hercules, that he was the first that ever suffered his\nenemies to carry away their dead bodies, after they had been\nput to the sword. But whosoever he was, at this day, in the\nvillage of \n                  , they do shew the place where the people\nwere buried, and where princes' tombs are seen about the city\nof \n                  , which he made at the request of Adrastus. And\nfor testimony hereof, the tragedy Aeschylus made of the Eleusinians,\nwhere he causeth it to be spoken even thus to Theseus\nhimself, cloth clearly overthrow the \n                   in Euripides.\n\n\n                  Touching the friendship betwixt Pirithous and him, it is said\nit began thus. The renown of his valiancy was marvellously\nblown abroad through all Greece, and Pirithous, desirous to\nknow it by experience, went even of purpose to invade his\n\n\ncountry, and brought away a certain booty of oxen of his, taken\nout of the country of Marathon. Theseus, being \n                  \nthereof, armed straight, and went to the rescue. Pirithous,\nhearing of his coming, fled not at all, but returned back suddenly\nto meet him. And so soon as they came to see one another,\nthey both wondered at each other's beauty and courage,\nand so had they no desire to fight. But Pirithous, reaching out\nhis hand first to Theseus, said unto him: \"I make yourself\njudge of the damage you have sustained by my invasion, and\nwith all my heart I will make such satisfaction, as it shall please\nyou to assess it at.\" Theseus then did not only release him of\nall the damages he had done, but also requested him he would\nbecome his friend and brother-in-arms. Hereupon they were\npresently sworn brethren in the field: after which oath betwixt\nthem, Pirithous married Deidamia, and sent to pray Theseus to\ncome to his marriage, to visit his country, and to make merry\nwith the Lapithae ..\n\n\n                  \n                  Theseus and Pirithous went together to the city of Lacedaemon,\nwhere they took away Helen (being yet very young)\neven as she was dancing in the temple of Diana surnamed\nOrthia: and they fled for life. They of Lacedaemon sent after\nher; but those that followed went no further than the city of\nTegea. Now when they were escaped out of the country of\nPeloponnesus, they agreed to draw lots together, which of them\ntwo should have her, with condition that whose lot it were to\nhave her, he should take her to his wife, and should be bound\nalso to help his companion to get him another.  It was Theseus'\nhap to light upon her, who carried her to the city of \n                  ,\nbecause she was yet too young to be married. Whither he\ncaused his mother to come to bring her up, and gave his friend\ncalled Aphidnus the charge of them both, recommending her to\nhis good care, and to keep it so secretly, that nobody should\nknow what was become of her. Because he would do the like\nfor Pirithous (according to the agreement made betwixt them)\nhe went into Epirus with him to steal the daughter of Aidoneus,\nking of the Molossians, who had surnamed his wife Proserpina,\nhis daughter Proserpina, and his dog Cerberus, with whom he\nmade them fight which came to ask his daughter in marriage,\npromising to give her to him that should overcome his Cerberus.\nBut the king understanding that Pirithous. was come, not to\nrequest his daughter in marriage, but to steal her away, he took\nhim prisoner with Theseus: and as for Pirithous, he caused him\n\n                  \n                   to be torn in pieces with his dog, and shut Theseus\nup in close prison.......\n\n\n                  But Aedoneus king of the Molossians, feasting Hercules\none day as he passed through his realm, descended by chance\ninto talk of Theseus and Pirithous, how they came to steal\naway his daughter secretly: and after told how they were also\npunished. Hercules was marvellous sorry to understand that\none of them was now dead, and the other in danger to die;\nand thought with himself that to make his moan to Aedoneus,\nit would not help the matter: he besought him only that he\nwould deliver Theseus for his sake. And he granted him. Thus\nTheseus being delivered of his captivity, returned to Athens,\nwhere his friends were not altogether kept under by his enemies:\nand at his return he did dedicate to Hercules all the\ntemples, which the city had before caused to be built in his own\nhonour...."}}}, {"@n": "Alc.", "front": {"div": {"@type": "toc", "pb": {"@n": "291"}, "head": "Extracts from the Life of Alcibiades", "list": {"@type": "simple", "item": [{"ref": {"@n": "para. 1", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "1.Description of ALCIBIADES, and anecdotes of his early days.

For where Euripides saith that, of all the fair times\nof the year, the autumn or latter season is the fairest: that commonly\nfalleth not out true. And yet it proved true in Alcibiades,\nthough in few other: for he was passing fair even to his\nlatter time, and of good temperature of body. They write of\nhim also, that his tongue was somewhat fat, and it did not become\nhim ill, but gave a certain natural pleasant grace in his\ntalk: which Aristophanes mentioneth, mocking one Theorus\nthat did counterfeit a lisping grace with his tongue:\n\n\n                  \n\nAnd Archippus, another poet also, mocking the son of Alcibiades,\nsaith thus:\n\n\n\n                  \n                  For his manners, they altered and changed very oft with time,\nwhich is not to be wondered at, seeing his marvellous great\nprosperity, as also adversity that followed him afterwards. But\nof all the great desires he had, and that by nature he was most\ninclined to, was ambition, seeking to have the upper hand in\nall things, and to be taken for the best person: as appeareth\nby certain of his deeds, and notable sayings in his youth, extant\nin writing. One day wrestling with a companion of his, that\nhandled him hardly, and thereby was likely to have given him\nthe fall, he got his fellow's arm in his mouth, and bit so hard,\nas he would have eaten it off. The other feeling him bite so\nhard, let go his hold straight, and said unto him: \" What, Alcibiades?\nbitest thou like a woman?\" \"No, mary, do I not'\"\nquoth he, \"but like a lion.\" Another time, being but a little\nboy, he played at \n                   in the midst of the street with other\nof his companions, and when his turn came about to throw,\nthere came a cart laden by chance that way: Alcibiades prayed\nthe carter to stay awhile, until he had played out his game, because\nthe skails were set right in the highway where the cart\nshould pass over. The carter was a stubborn knave, and would\nnot stay for any request the boy could make, but crave his\nhorse on still, insomuch as other boys gave back to let him go\non: but Alcibiades fell flat to the ground before the cart, and\nbad the carter drive over, \n                   he durst. The carter, being\nafraid, plucked back his horse to stay them: the neighbours,\nfrighted to see the danger, ran to the boy in all haste, crying\nout. Afterwards, when he was put to school to learn, he was very obedient to all his masters that taught him anything, saving\nthat he disdained to learn to play on the flute or \n                  :\n\nsaying that it was no gentlemanly quality. \" For,\" said he, \" to play on the viol with a stick cloth not alter man's \n                  ,\nnor disgrace any gentleman: but otherwise, to play on the flute,\nhis countenance altereth and changeth so oft, that his familiar\nfriends can \n                   know him. Moreover the harp or viol cloth\n\n                   him that playeth on them from speaking or singing as\nhe playeth: \n                   he that playeth on the flute holdeth his\nmouth so hard to it, that it taketh not only his words from him,\nbut his voice. Therefore,\" said he, \" let the children of the\nThebans play on the flute, that cannot tell how to speak: as\nfor the Athenians, we have (as our forefathers tell us) for protectors\nand patrons of our country, the goddess Pallas and the\ngod Apollo: of the which the one in old time (as it is said)\nbrake the flute, and the other pulled his skin over \n                   that played upon a flute.\" Thus Alcibiades alleging these reasons,\npartly in sport, and partly in good earnest, did not only\nhimself \n                   to learn to play on the flute, but he turned his\ncompanions' minds also quite from it. For these words of Alcibiades\nran from boy to boy \n                  : \"that Alcibiades\nhad reason to despise playing on the flute, and that he mocked\nall those that learned to play on it.\" So afterwards, it fell out\nat Athens, that teaching to play on the flute was put out of the\nnumber of honest and liberal exercises, and the flute itself was\nthought a vile instrument and of no reputation.......\n\n\n                   \n                  Alcibiades had a marvellous fair great dog, that cost him\nthreescore and ten , and he cut off his tail that was his\nchief beauty. When his friends reproved him, and told him\nhow every man blamed him for it: he fell a-laughing, and told\nthem he had that he sought. \"For,\" saith he, \" I would have\nthe Athenians rather prate upon that, than they should say\nworse of me.\" \n\n\n                  Moreover, it is said, the first time that Alcibiades\nspake openly in the commonweal, and began to deal in matters,\nwas upon a gift of money he gave unto the people, and not of\nany \n                   or former purpose he had to do it. One day as\nhe came through the market-place, hearing the people very\nloud, he asked what the matter was: they told him it was about\nmoney certain men had given to the people. Then Alcibiades\nwent to them, and gave them money out of his own purse.\nThe people were so glad at that, \n                   they fell to shouting and\nclapping of their hands, in token of thankfulness: and himself\nwas so glad for company, that he \n                   a quail he had under\nhis gown, which was so \n                   the noise, that she took her\n\nflight away. The people, seeing the quail, made a greater\nnoise than before, and many rose out of their places to run\nafter her: so that in the end, it was taken up by a master of a\nship called Antiochus, who brought him the quail again, and\nfor that cause Alcibiades did love him ever after. Now albeit\nthe nobility of his house, his goods, his worthiness and the\ngreat number of his kinsmen and friends, made his way open\nto take upon him government in the commonweal: yet the only\nway he desired to win the favour of the common people by was\nthe grace of his eloquence. To prove he was eloquent, all the\n\n                   poets do testify it: and besides them Demosthenes,\nthe prince of orators, also cloth say, in an oration he made\nagainst Medias, that Alcibiades, above all other qualities he\nhad, was most eloquent. And if we may believe Theophrastus,\nthe greatest searcher of antiquities, and best historiographer\nabove any other philosopher: he hath written, that Alcibiades\nhad as good a wit to devise and consider what he would say, as\nany man that was in his time. Howbeit sometimes, studying\nwhat he should say, as also to deliver good words, not having\nthem very ready at his tongue's end, he many times took breath\nby the way, and paused in the \n                   of his tale, not speaking\na word, until he had called it to mind that he would say. \n\nHis\ncharge was great, and much spoken of also, for keeping of running\nhorses at games: not only because they were the best and\nswiftest, but for the number of coaches he had besides. For\nnever private person, no, nor any prince, did ever send seven so\nwell-appointed coaches in all furniture, unto the games Olympical,\nas he did: nor that at one course hath borne away the first,\nthe second, and the fourth \n                  , as Thucydides saith: or as\nEuripides reporteth, the third. For in that game he excelled all\nmen in honour and name, that ever strived for victory therein.\nFor Euripides pronounced his praise, in a song he made of him,\nas followeth:\n\n\n                  \n\n                  Howbeit the good affection divers cities did bear him, contending\nwhich should gratify him best, did much increase his fame\nand honour.......\n\n\n                  \n                  Yet with all these goodly deeds and fair words of Alcibiades, and with this great courage and quickness of understanding,\nhe had many great faults and imperfections. For he\nwas too dainty in his fare, wantonly given, riotous in \n                  ,\nvain and womanish in apparel: he \n                   ever a long purple\ngown that swept the market-place as he walked up and down,\nit had such a train, and was too rich and costly for him to wear.\nAnd following these vain pleasures and delights, when he was\nin his galley, he caused the planks of the poop thereof to be cut\nand broken up, that he might lie the softer: for his bed was not\nlaid upon the \n                  , but laid upon \n                   strained over the\nhole, cut out and fastened to the sides, and he carried to the\nwars with him a gilded \n                  , wherein he had no cognizance,\nnor ordinary device of the Athenians, but only had the\nimage of Cupid in it, holding lightning in his hand. The noblemen\nand best citizens of Athens perceiving this, they hated\nhis fashions and conditions, and were much offended at him,\nand were \n                   withal of his rashness and insolency: he did so\ncontemn the laws and customs of their country, being manifest\ntokens of a man that aspired to be king, and would subvert and\nturn all \n                  . And as for the goodwill of the common\npeople towards him, the poet Aristophanes cloth plainly express\nit in these words:\n\n\n\nAnd in another place he said also, aggravating the suspicion\nthey had of him:\n\n\n\nFor to say truly: his courtesies, his liberalities, and noble expenses\nto shew the people so great pleasure and pastime as\nnothing could be more: the glorious memory of his ancestors,\nthe grace of his eloquence, the beauty of his person, the strength\nand valiantness of his body, joined together with his wisdom\nand experience in martial affairs: were the very causes that\nmade them to bear with him in all things, and that the Athenians\ndid patiently endure all his light parts, and did cover his\n\nfaults with the best words and teens they could, calling them\nyouthful, and gentlemen's sports. As when he kept Agartharcus\nthe painter prisoner in his house by force, until he had painted\nall his walls within: and when he had done, did let him go, and\nrewarded him very \n                   for his pains. Again, when he gave\na box on the ear to Taureas, who did pay the whole \n                   of\na company of common players, in spite of him, to carry away\nthe honour of the games.......\n\n And on a day as he came from the council and assembly\nof the city, where he had made an excellent oration, to the great\ngood liking and acceptation of all the hearers, and by means\nthereof had obtained the thing he desired, and was accompanied\nwith a great train that followed him to his honour: Timon, surnamed\nMisanthropos (as who would say, \n                  , or the manhater),\nmeeting Alcibiades thus accompanied, did not pass by\nhim, nor gave him way (as he was wont to do all other men),\nbut went straight to him, and took him by the hand, and said:\n\"O, thou cost well, my son, I \n                   thee thank, that thou goest\non and \n                    up still: for if ever thou be in authority, wo be\nunto those that follow thee, for they are utterly undone'\" When\nthey heard these words, those that stood by fell a-laughing:\n\n                   reviled Timon; other again marked well his words, and\nthought of them many a time after: such sundry opinions they\nhad of him for the unconstancy of his life, and waywardness of\nhis nature and conditions.......\n\n\n                  \n                  Now though the people had no more occasion to occupy\ntheir busy heads about the breakers of these images, yet was not\ntheir malice thus appeased against Alcibiades, until they sent\nthe galley called Salaminiana, commanding those they sent by a\nspecial commission to seek him out, in no case to attempt to\ntake him by force, nor to lay hold on him by violence: but to\nuse him with all the good words and courteous manner that\nthey possibly could, and \n                   him only to appear in person\nbefore the people, to answer to certain accusations put up\nagainst him. If otherwise they should have used force, they\nfeared much lest the army would have \n                   on his behalf\nwithin the country of their enemies, and that there would have\ngrown some sedition amongst their soldiers. This might Alcibiades\nhave easily done, if he had been disposed: for the soldiers\nwere very sorry to see him depart, perceiving that the wars\nshould be drawn out now in length, and be much prolonged\nunder Nicias, seeing Alcibiades was taken from them, who was\n\nthe only spur that pricked Nicias forward to do any service:\nand that Lamachus also, though he were a valiant man of his\nhands, yet he lacked honour and authority in the army, because\nhe was but a mean man born, and poor besides. \n\nNow Alcibiades,\nfor a farewell, disappointed the Athenians of winning the\ncity of Messina: for they having intelligence by certain private\npersons within the city, that it would yield up into their hand,\nAlcibiades, knowing them very well by their names, \n                  \nthem unto those that were the Syracusans' friends: whereupon\nall this \n                   was broken utterly. Afterwards when he came\nto the city of Thuries, so soon as he had landed, he went and\nhid himself \n                   in such sort, that such as sought for\nhim could not find him. Yet there was one that knew him\nwhere he was, and said: \"Why, how now, Alcibiades? darest\nthou not trust the justice of thy country?\" \"Yes, very well,\"\nquoth he, \"\n                   it were in another matter: but my life standing\nupon it, I would not trust mine own mother, fearing lest negligently\nshe should put in the black bean where she should cast\nin the white :\" for, by the first, condemnation of death was signified:\nand by the other, pardon of life. But afterwards, hearing\nthat the Athenians for malice had condemned him to death:\n\" Well,'' quoth he, \" they shall know I am yet alive.\" Now the\nmanner of his accusation and indictment framed against him,\nwas found written in this sort: 'Thessalus, the son of Cimon,\nof the village of Laciades, hath accused and cloth accuse Alcibiades,\nthe son of Clinias, of the village of Scambonides, to\nhave offended against the goddesses, Ceres and Proserpina,\ncounterfeiting in mockery their holy mysteries, and strewing\nthem to his familiar friends in his house, himself apparelled\nand arrayed in a long vestment or cope, like unto the vestment\nthe priest weareth when he sheweth these holy sacred mysteries:\nand naming himself the priest, Polytion the torch-bearer, and\nTheodorus of the village of Phygea the verger, and the other\nlookers-on brethren and fellow-scorners with them, and all done\nin manifest contempt and derisien of holy ceremonies and mysteries\nof the Eumolpides, the religious priests and ministers of\nthe sacred temple of the city of \n                  \n                  .' So Alcibiades, for\nhis contempt and not appealing, was condemned, and his goods\n\n                  . Besides this condemnation, they decreed also, that\nall the religious priests and women should \n                   and accurse\nhim. But hereunto answered one of the nuns called Theano,\nthe daughter of Menon, of the village of Agraula, saying that\n\nshe was professed religious, to pray and to bless, not to curse\nand ban. \n\nAfter this most grievous sentence and condemnation\npassed against him, Alcibiades departed out of the city of Thuries,\nand went into the country of Peloponnesus, where he continued\na good season in the city of Argos. But in the end,\nfearing his enemies, and having no hope to return again to his\nown country with any safety: he sent unto Sparta to have safe\nconduct and licence of the Lacedaemonians, that he might come\nand dwell in their country, promising them he would do to\nthem more good being now their friend, than he ever did them\nhurt while he was their enemy. The Lacedaemonians granted\nhis request, and received him very willingly into their city:\nwhere, even upon his first coming, he did three things. The\nfirst was: that the Lacedaemonians, by his persuasion and procurement,\ndid determine speedily to send aid to the Syracusans,\nwhom they had long before delayed: and so they sent Gylippus\ntheir captain to overthrow the Athenians' army, which they had\nsent thither. The second thing he did for them, was: that he\nmade them of Greece to begin war upon the Athenians. The\nthird, and greatest matter of importance, was: that he did\ncounsel them to fortify the city of Decelea, which was within\nthe territories of Attica \n                  : which consumed and brought the\npower of the Athenians lower than any other thing whatsoever\nhe could have done. And if he were welcome, and well esteemed\nin Sparta, for the service he did to the commonwealth: much\nmore he \n                   the love and goodwills of private men, for that he\nlived after the Laconian manner. So as they that saw his skin\nscraped to the flesh, and saw him wash himself in cold water,\nand how he did eat brown bread, and sup of their black broth,\nwould have doubted (or to say better, never have believed) that\nsuch a man had ever kept cook in his house, nor that he ever\nhad seen so much as a perfuming-pan, or had touched cloth of\ntissue made at Miletum. For among other qualities and properties\nhe had (whereof he was full) this, as they say, was one\nwhereby he most robbed men's hearts: that he could \n                  \naltogether with their manners and fashions of life, transforming\nhimself more easily to all manner of shapes than the chameleon.\nFor it is reported, that the chameleon cannot take white colour:\nbut Alcibiades could put upon him any manners, customs, or\nfashions, of what nation soever, and could follow, exercise, and\ncounterfeit them when he would, as well the good as the bad.\nFor in Sparta, he was very \n                  , and in continual exercise:\n\nhe lived sparingly with little, end led a \n                   life. In Ionia,\nto the contrary, there he lived daintily and superfluously, and\ngave himself to all mirth and pleasure. In Thracia, he drank\never, or was always on horseback. If he came to Tisaphernes,\nlieutenant of the mighty king of Persia, he far exceeded the\nmagnificence of Persia in pomp and sumptuousness. And these\nthings notwithstanding, never altered his natural condition from\none fashion to another, neither did his manners (to say truly) receive\nall sorts of changes. But because peradventure, if he had\nshewed his natural disposition, he might, in divers places where\nhe came, have offended those whose company he kept, he did\nwith such a \n                   and \n                   disguise himself, to fit their manners\nwhom he companied with, by transforming himself into\ntheir natural countenance, as he that had seen him when he\nwas at Sparta, to have looked upon the outward man, would\nhave said as the common proverb saith:\n\n\n\nEven so, it is even he whom Lycurgus brought up. But he that\nhad inwardly seen his natural doings and good-will indeed lie\nnaked before him would, contrarily, have used this common\nsaying:\n\n\n\n                  \n                  \n                  Then were the Athenians sorry, and repented them when\nthey had received so great loss and hurt, for that they had decreed\nso severely against Alcibiades, who in like manner was\nvery sorrowful to see them brought to so hard terms, fearing, if\nthe city of Athens came to destruction, that he himself should\nfall in the end into the hands of the Lacedaemonians, who\n\n                   him to the death. Now about that time, all the power\nof the Athenians was almost in the \n                   of Samos, from whence,\nwith their army by sea, they sought to suppress the rebels that\nwere up against them, and to keep all that which yet remained.\nFor they were yet \n                   strong to resist the enemies, at the\nleast by sea: but they stood in fear of the power of Tisaphernes,\nand of the hundred and fifty galleys which were reported to be\ncoming out of their country of Phoenicia to the aid of their enemies,\nwhich if they had come, the city of Athens had been\nutterly spoiled, and for ever without hope of recovery. The\nwhich Alcibiades understanding, sent secretly unto the chiefest\nmen that were in the army of the Athenians at Samos, to give\nthem hope he would make Tisaphernes their friend: howbeit\n\nnot of any desire he had to gratify the people, nor that he\ntrusted to the commonalty of Athens, but only to the honourable\nand honest citizens, and that conditionally, so as they had the\nheart and courage to \n                   a little the over-licentiousness and\ninsolency of the common people, and that they would take\nupon them the authority to govern, and to redress their state,\nand to preserve the city of Athens from final and utter destruction.\nUpon this \n                  , all the heads and chief men\ndid give very good ear unto it: saving only Phrynichus, one of\nthe captains, and of the town of Dirades: who mistrusting (that\nwas true indeed) that Alcibiades cared not which end went forward,\nnor who had the chief government of Athens, the nobility\nor the commonalty, and did but seek all the devices and ways\nhe could, to return again if it might be possible, in any manner\nof sort, and that he did but curry favour with the nobility,\nblaming and accusing the people, he stood altogether against\nthe motion; whereupon Alcibiades' device was not followed.......\n\n\n                   Now the common people that remained still in the city,\nstirred not, but were quiet against their wills, for fear of danger,\nbecause there were many of them slain, that boldly took upon\nthem in open presence to resist these four hundred [of the nobility]. But those that were in the camp in the \n                   of Samos,\nhearing these news, were so grievously offended, that they resolved\nto return \n                   again unto the haven of Piraea.\nFirst of all, they sent for Alcibiades, whom they chose their\ncaptain; then they commanded him \n                   to lead them\nagainst these tyrants, who had usurped the liberty of the people\nof Athens. But nevertheless he did not herein, as another\nwould have done in this case, seeing himself so suddenly crept\nagain in favour with the common people: for he did not think\nhe should incontinently please and gratify them in all things,\nthough they had made him now their general over all their ships\nand so great an army; being before but a banished man, a\n\n                  , and a fugitive. But to the contrary, as it became a\ngeneral worthy of such a charge, he considered with himself\nthat it was his part wisely to stay those who would in a rage\nand fury carelessly cast themselves away, and not suffer them to\ndo it. And truly Alcibiades was the cause of the preserving of\nthe city of Athens at that time from utter destruction. For if\nthey had suddenly (according to their determination) departed\nfrom Samos to go to Athens: the enemies, finding no man to\n\n                   them, might easily have won all the country of Ionia, of\n\nHellespont, and of all the other \n                   without stroke striking,\nwhilst the Athenians were busy fighting one against another in\ncivil wars, and within the compass of their own walls. This\nAlcibiades alone, and no other, did prevent, not only by persuading\nthe whole army, and declaring the inconvenience\nthereof, which would fall out upon their sudden departure: but\nalso by intreating some \n                   apart, and keeping a number\nback by very force.......\n\n\n                   \n                  Now Alcibiades, desirous in the end to see his native\ncountry again (to speak more truly, that his country-men should\nsee him) after he had so many times overthrown their enemies\nin battle, he \n                   sail and directed his course towards\nA hens, bringing with him all the galleys of the Athenians\nrichly furnished and decked all about with \n                   and\n\n                  , and other armour and weapon gotten amongst the\nspoils of his enemies. Moreover, he brought with him many\nother ships which he had won and broken in the wars, besides\nmany ensigns and other ornaments: all which being counted\ntogether, one with the other, made up the number of two hundred\nships. Furthermore, where Duris Samian writeth (who \n                  \n that he came of his house) that at his return one\nChrysogonus, an excellent player on the flute (that had won\ncertain of the Pythian games) did play such a note, that at the\nsound thereof the galley-slaves would keep stroke with their\noars, and that Callippides, another excellent player of tragedies,\nplaying the part of a comedy, did stir them to row, being in such\nprayers' garments as every master of such science useth commonly\nto wear, presenting himself in theatre or stage before the\npeople to shew his art; and that the \n                   galley, wherein\nhimself was, entered the haven with a purple sail, as if some\n\n                   had come into a man's house after some great banquet made: neither Ephorus, nor Theopompus, nor Xenophon, make\nany mention of this at all. Furthermore, methinks it should not\nbe true that he (returning from exile after so long a banishment,\nand having passed over such sorrows and calamities as he had\nsustained) would so proudly and presumptuously shew himself\nunto the Athenians. But \n                   contrary, it is most certain\nthat he returned in great fear and doubt. For when he was\narrived in the haven of Piraea, he would not set foot \n                  ,\nbefore he first saw his nephew Euryptolemus, and divers other\nof his friends, from the hatches of his ship, standing upon the\nsands in the haven's mouth: who were come thither to receive\n\nand welcome him, and told him that he might be bold to land,\nwithout fear of anything. He was no sooner landed, but all the\npeople ran out of every corner to see him, with so great love\nand affection, that they took no heed of the other captains that\ncame with him, but clustered all to him only, and cried out for\njoy to see him. Those that could come near him, did welcome\nand \n                   him: but all the people wholly followed him. And\nsome that came to him, put garlands of flowers upon his head:\nand those that could not come near him saw him afar off, and\nthe old folks did point him out to the younger sort. But this\ncommon joy was mingled notwithstanding with tears and sorrow,\nwhen they came to think upon their former misfortunes and\ncalamities, and to compare them with their present prosperity:\n\n                   with themselves also how they had not lost Sicilia, nor\ntheir hope in all things else had failed them, if they had delivered\nthemselves and the charge of their army into Alcibiades'\nhands, when they sent for him to appear in person before them.\nConsidering also how he found the city of Athens in manner put\nfrom the \n                   and commandment of the sea; and on the\nother side, how their force by land was brought into such extremity,\nthat Athens \n                   could defend her suburbs, the city\n\n                   being so divided and turmoiled with civil dissension: yet\nhe gathered together those few and small force that remained,\nand had not only restored Athens to her former power and\nsovereignty on the sea, but had made her also conqueror by\nland.\n\nNow the decree for his repair home again passed before by\nthe people, at the instant request of Callias, the son of Callaeschrus,\nwho did \n                   it: as he himself did testify in his Elegies,\nputting Alcibiades in remembrance of the good turn he had\ndone him, saying:\n\n\n\n                  But notwithstanding, the people being assembled in council,\nAlcibiades came before them, and made an oration: wherein he\nfirst lamented all his mishaps, and found himself grieved a little\nwith the wrongs they had offered him, yet he imputed all in the\n\nend to his cursed fortune, and some spiteful god that envied his\nglory and prosperity. Then he dilated at large the great hope\ntheir enemies had to have advantage of them: and therewithal\npersuaded the people to be of good courage, and \n                   of\nnothing that was to come. And to conclude, the people crowned\nhim with crowns of gold, and chose him general again of Athens,\nwith sovereign power and authority both by land and by sea.\nAnd at that very instant it was decreed by the people that he\nshould be restored again to his goods, and that the priests\nEumolpides should absolve him of all their curses, and that the\nheralds should with open proclamation revoke the execrations\nand cursings they had thundered out against him before, by\ncommandment of the people. Whereto they all agreed and\nwere very willing, saving Theodorus the bishop, who said: \"I\ndid neither excommunicate him nor curse him, if he hath done\nno hurt to the commonwealth.\" Now Alcibiades flourished in\nhis chiefest prosperity, yet were there some notwithstanding\nthat \n                   very much the time of his landing, saying it was\nvery unlucky and unfortunate.......\n\n\n                   For if ever man was overthrown and envied for the estimation\nthey had of his valour and sufficiency, truly Alcibiades\nwas the man. For the notable and sundry services he had done\nwon him such estimation of wisdom and valiantness, that where\nhe \n                   in any service whatsoever, he was \n                   suspected,\njudging the ill success not in that he could not, but for\nthat he would not: and that where he undertook any enterprise,\nnothing could withstand or lie in his way. Hereupon the people\npersuading themselves, that immediately after his departure,\nthey should hear that the \n                    of Chio was taken, with all the\ncountry of Ionia, they were angry they could have no news so\nsuddenly from him as they looked for. Moreover, they did not\nconsider the lack of money he had, and specially making war\nwith such enemies, as were ever relieved \n                   the great king of\nPersia's aid, and that for necessity's sake he was sundry times\ndriven to leave his camp, to seek money where he could get it,\nto pay his soldiers and to maintain his army. Now for testimony\nhereof, the last accusation that was against him was\nonly for this matter. Lysander being sent by the Lacedaemonians\nfor admiral and general of their army by sea, used such\npolicy with Cyrus the king of Persia's brother, that he got into\nhis hands a great sum of money: by means whereof he gave\nunto his mariners four obols a day for their wages, where before\n\nthey were wont to have but three, and yet Alcibiades had much\nado to furnish his with three only a day......\n\n\n                  \n                  Now was Alcibiades in a certain village of Phrygia, with\na concubine of his called Timandra. So he thought he dreamed\none night that he had put on his concubine's apparel, and how\nshe, candling him in her arms, had dressed his head, frizzled\nhis hair, and painted his face, as he had been a woman. Other\nsay that he thought Magaeus strake off his head, and made his\nbody to be burnt: and the \n                   goeth, this vision was but a\nlittle before his death.
