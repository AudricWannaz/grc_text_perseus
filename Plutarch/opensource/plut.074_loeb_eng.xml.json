If such were the case, it were well for us, as it appears, to\n\t\t\t\t\tbeware of trusting our senses ! But, as a matter of fact, Nature has\n\t\t\t\t\tconferred upon us sight, hearing, taste, smell, and our other members and\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir faculties to be ministers of sagacity and intelligence, and  Precisely as\n\t\t\t\t\twould be our case if the sun did not exist, and we, for all the other stars,\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be passing our life in a continual night, as Heracleitus  affirms, so\n\t\t\t\t\tman, for all his senses, had he not mind and reason, would not differ at all\n\t\t\t\t\tin his life from the brutes. \n\t\t\t\t\t But as it is, we excel them and have power over them,\n\t\t\t\t\tnot from chance or accidentally, but the cause thereof is Prometheus, or, in\n\t\t\t\t\tother words, the power to think and reason,  as Aeschylus \n\t\t\t\t\tputs it. Certainly, in so far as chance and nature's endowment at birth are\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned, the great majority of brute animals are better off than man. For\n\t\t\t\t\tsome are armed with horns, or teeth, or stings, and Empedocles says,  and still others are shod and clad with scales or hair, with\n\t\t\t\t\tclaws or horny hoofs. Man alone, as Plato  says,  has been abandoned\n\t\t\t\t\tby Nature.  the gift of reasoning,\n\t\t\t\t\tdiligence, and forethought.  Horses are the\n\t\t\t\t\tlightest and swiftest of foot, yet they run for man. The dog is pugnacious\n\t\t\t\t\tand \n\t\t\t\t\t spirited, yet it watches over man. Fish is most savoury,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the pig very fat, yet for man they are nourishing and appetizing food.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is bigger than an elephant or more terrible to behold ? But even this\n\t\t\t\t\tcreature has been made the plaything of man, and a spectacle at public\n\t\t\t\t\tgatherings, and it learns to posture and dance and kneel. Such\n\t\t\t\t\tpresentations are not without their use ; indeed, they serve a purpose in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat we may learn to what heights man's intelligence raises him, above what\n\t\t\t\t\tit places him, and how he is master of all things, and in every way\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperior.  Indeed, in all these matters we are not so fortunate\n\t\t\t\t\tas the animals ; yet we make use of experience, memory, wisdom, and skill,\n\t\t\t\t\tas Anaxagoras  says, which are ours, and ours only, and we take their honey,\n\t\t\t\t\tand milk them, and carry and lead them at will, taking entire control over\n\t\t\t\t\tthem.

This is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe only recorded instance of a technical achievement due to chance. Rulers,\n\t\t\t\t\tweights, measures, and numbers are everywhere in use, so that the random and\n\t\t\t\t\thaphazard may find no place in any production.
