It was impracticable either to bring these men to trial in a time of so much confusion, or to overlook their plots.

He was not willing to give up to them formally the country which was actually in their power, and persisted in his opposition. As a consequence, he not only did not recover Messenia, but almost lost Sparta besides, after being outgeneralled. \n\t\t\t\tFor when the Mantineans changed their allegiance,\n\t\t\t\t revolted from Thebes, and called in the Lacedaemonians to help them, Epaminondas, learning that Agesilas had marched out from Sparta with his forces and was approaching, set out by night from Tegea, without the knowledge of the Mantineans, and led his army against Sparta itself. He passed by Agesilas, and came within a little of suddenly seizing the city in a defenceless state.\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t        But Euthynus, a Thespian, as Callisthenes says, or, according to Xenophon,\n\t\t\t\t a certain Cretan, brought word to Agesilas, who quickly sent on a horseman to warn the people in Sparta, and not long after his arrival the Thebans were crossing the Eurotas and attacking the city, while Agesilas defended it right vigorously and in a manner not to be expected of his years. \n\t\t\t\tFor he did not think, as on a former occasion, that the crisis demanded safe and cautious measures, but rather deeds of desperate daring. In these he had never put confidence before, nor had he employed them, but then it was only by their aid that he repelled the danger, snatching the city out of the grasp of Epaminondas, erecting a trophy of victory, and showing their wives and children that the Lacedaemonians were making the fairest of all returns to their country for its rearing of them. \n\t\t\t\tArchidamus, too, fought among the foremost, conspicuous for his impetuous courage and for his agility, running swiftly through the narrow streets to the endangered points in the battle, and everywhere pressing hard upon the enemy with his few followers.\n\t\t\t\t But I think that Isidas, the son of Phoebidas, must have been a strange and marvellous sight, not only to his fellow-citizens, but also to his enemies. \n\t\t\t\tHe was of conspicuous beauty and stature, and at an age when the human flower has the greatest charm, as the boy merges into the man. Naked as he was, without either defensive armour or clothing,for he had just anointed his body with oil,he took a spear in one hand, and a sword in the other, leaped forth from his house, and after pushing his way through the midst of the combatants, ranged up and down among the enemy, smiting and laying low all who encountered him. \n\t\t\t\tAnd no man gave him a wound, whether it was that a god shielded him on account of his valour, or that the enemy thought him taller and mightier than a mere man could be. For this exploit it is said that the ephors put a garland on his head, and then fined him a thousand drachmas, because he had dared to hazard his life in battle without armour."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "35", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "1", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "2", "@unit": "section"}], "note": {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "bibl": {"@n": "Xen.
