And so of philosophical discourses it is clear to us that those\n\t\t\t\t\tseemingly not at all philosophical, or even serious, are found more\n\t\t\t\t\tenjoyable by the very young, who present themselves at such lectures as\n\t\t\t\t\twilling and submissive hearers. For in perusing not only Aesop's Fables, and\n\t\t\t\t\tTales from the Poets, but even the Abaris of Heracleides, the Lycon of\n\t\t\t\t\tAriston, and philosophic doctrines about the soul when these are combined\n\t\t\t\t\twith tales from mythology, they get inspiration as well as\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure. Wherefore we ought not only to keep the young decorous in the\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasures of eating and drinking, but, even more, in connexion with what\n\t\t\t\t\tthey hear and read, by using in moderation, as a relish, that which gives\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure, we should accustom them to seek what is useful and salutary\n\t\t\t\t\ttherein. For close-shut gates do not  preserve a city from\n\t\t\t\t\tcapture if it admit the enemy through one; nor does continence in the other\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasures of sense save a young man, if he unwittingly abandon himself to\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which comes through hearing. On the contrary, inasmuch as this form of\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure engages more closely the man that is naturally given to thought and\n\t\t\t\t\treason, so much the more, if neglected, does it injure and corrupt him that\n\t\t\t\t\treceives it. Since, then, it is neither possible, perhaps, nor profitable to\n\t\t\t\t\tdebar from poetry a boy as old as my Soclarus and your Cleander now are, let\n\t\t\t\t\tus keep a very close watch over them, in the firm belief that they require\n\t\t\t\t\toversight in their reading even more than in the streets. Accordingly, I\n\t\t\t\t\thave made up my mind to commit to writing and to send to you some thoughts\n\t\t\t\t\ton poetry which it occurred to me recently to express. I beg that you will\n\t\t\t\t\ttake them and peruse them, and if they seem to you to be no worse than the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings called amethysts  which some persons on convivial occasions hang upon\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir persons or take beforehand, then impart them to Cleander, and thus\n\t\t\t\t\tforestall his natural disposition, which, because it is slow in nothing, but\n\t\t\t\t\timpetuous and lively in everything, is more subject to such influences.\n\t\t\t\t\t because it is very pleasant\n\t\t\t\t\tto eat but it makes one's sleep full of bad dreams and subject to strange\n\t\t\t\t\tand disturbing fancies, as they say. Similarly also in the art of poetry\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is much that is pleasant and nourishing for the mind of a youth, but\n\t\t\t\t\tquite as much  that is disturbing and misleading, unless\n\t\t\t\t\tin the hearing of it he have proper oversight. For it may be said, as it\n\t\t\t\t\tseems, not only of the land of the Egyptians but also of poetry, that it\n\t\t\t\t\tyields  to those who cultivate it.  For the element of deception\n\t\t\t\t\tin it does not gain any hold on utterly witless and foolish persons. This is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ground of Simonides' answer to the man who said to him,  His\n\t\t\t\t\tanswer was, \n\t\t\t\t\t; and Gorgias called tragedy a deception wherein he who deceives is more\n\t\t\t\t\thonest than he who does not deceive, and he who is deceived is wiser than he\n\t\t\t\t\twho is not deceived. Shall we then stop the ears of the young, as those of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Ithacans were stopped, with a hard and unyielding wax, and force them to\n\t\t\t\t\tput to sea in the Epicurean boat, and avoid poetry and steer their course\n\t\t\t\t\tclear of it; or rather shall we set them against some upright standard of\n\t\t\t\t\treason and there bind them fast, guiding and guarding their judgement, that\n\t\t\t\t\tit may not be carried away from the course by pleasure towards that which\n\t\t\t\t\twill do them hurt ?  had sound sense, because, when many became drunk\n\t\t\t\t\tand violent, he went about uprooting the grapevines instead of bringing the\n\t\t\t\t\tsprings of water nearer,  and thus chastening the  as Plato says, \n                For the tempering of wine with water removes its\n\t\t\t\t\tharmfulness without depriving it at the same time of its usefulness. So let\n\t\t\t\t\tus not root up or destroy the Muses' vine of poetry, but where the mythical\n\t\t\t\t\tand dramatic part grows all riotous  and luxuriant, through pleasure unalloyed, which gives it\n\t\t\t\t\tboldness and obstinacy in seeking acclaim, let us take it in hand and prune\n\t\t\t\t\tit and pinch it back. But where with its grace it approaches a true kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tculture, and the sweet allurement of its language is not fruitless or\n\t\t\t\t\tvacuous, there let us introduce philosophy and blend it with poetry. For as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe mandragora, when it grows beside the vine and imparts its influence to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe wine, makes this weigh less heavily on those who drink it, so poetry, by\n\t\t\t\t\ttaking up its themes from philosophy and blending them with fable, renders\n\t\t\t\t\tthe task of learning light and agreeable for the young. Wherefore poetry\n\t\t\t\t\tshould not be avoided by those who are intending to pursue philosophy, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthey should use poetry as an introductory exercise in philosophy, by\n\t\t\t\t\ttraining themselves habitually to seek the profitable in what gives\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure, and to find satisfaction therein ; and if there be nothing\n\t\t\t\t\tprofitable, to combat such poetry and be dissatisfied with it. For this is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning of education,  as Sophocles says."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "2", "p": [{"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.83"}, {"@id": "v1.p.85"}, {"@id": "v1.p.87"}], "q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "Many the lies the poets\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttell,"}, "note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Metaphysics"}], "#text": "Proverbial;  Aristotle,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, i. 2."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Phaedo"}], "#text": "Plato, , 60\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Iliad"}, "#text": "Homer, , xx. 60."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Od."}, "#text": "Homer,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t xi. 470 and 360."}], "quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Trag.

For not metre nor figure of\n\t\t\t\t\tspeech nor loftiness of diction nor aptness of metaphor nor unity of\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposition has so much allurement and charm, as a clever interweaving of\n\t\t\t\t\tfabulous narrative. But, just as in pictures, colour is more stimulating\n\t\t\t\t\tthan line-drawing because it is life-like, and creates an illusion, so in\n\t\t\t\t\tpoetry falsehood combined with plausibility is more striking, and gives more\n\t\t\t\t\tsatisfaction, than the work which is elaborate in metre and diction, but\n\t\t\t\t\tdevoid of myth and fiction. This explains why Socrates, being induced by\n\t\t\t\t\tsome dreams to take up poetry, since he was not himself a plausible or\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally clever workman in falsehood, inasmuch as he had been the champion\n\t\t\t\t\tof truth all his life, put into verse the fables of Aesop, assuming that there can be no poetic composition which has no\n\t\t\t\t\taddition of falsehood. It is true that we know of sacrifices without dancing\n\t\t\t\t\tor flute, but we do not know of any poetic composition without fable or\n\t\t\t\t\twithout falsehood. The verses of Empedocles and of Parmenides, the Antidotes\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst Poisons of Nicander, and the maxims of Theognis, are merely\n\t\t\t\t\tcompositions which have borrowed from poetic  art its\n\t\t\t\t\tmetre and lofty style as a vehicle in order to avoid plodding along in\n\t\t\t\t\tprose. Whenever, therefore, in the poems of a man of note and repute some\n\t\t\t\t\tstrange and disconcerting statement either about gods or lesser deities or\n\t\t\t\t\tabout virtue is made by the author, he who accepts the statement as true is\n\t\t\t\t\tcarried off his feet, and has his opinions perverted; whereas he who always\n\t\t\t\t\tremembers and keeps clearly in mind the sorcery of the poetic art in dealing\n\t\t\t\t\twith falsehood, who is able on every such occasion to say to it, will not suffer any dire effects or even acquire any base beliefs,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut he will check himself when he feels afraid of Poseidon  and is in terror lest the\n\t\t\t\t\tgod rend the earth asunder and lay bare the nether world; he will check\n\t\t\t\t\thimself when he is feeling wroth at Apollo in behalf of the foremost of the\n\t\t\t\t\tAchaeans,  he will\n\t\t\t\t\tcease to shed tears over the dead Achilles and over Agamemnon  in the nether\n\t\t\t\t\tworld, as they stretch out their impotent and feeble arms in their desire to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe alive ; and if, perchance, he is beginning to be disturbed by their\n\t\t\t\t\tsuffering and overcome by the enchantment, he will not hesitate to say to\n\t\t\t\t\thimself, \n\t\t\t\t\t           Certainly Homer\n\t\t\t\t\thas put this gracefully in reference to the visit to the shades, indicating\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is fit stuff for a woman's ear because of the element of fable in\n\t\t\t\t\tit."}, {"quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Il."}, "#text": "Homer,  xxii.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t210."}, "#text": "In the scales he placed two fates of Death so grievous, One of Achilles\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the other of horse-taming Hector; Grasping the middle he poised it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Hector's fated day descended.

Take\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example what Homer has said relating to Zeus:  Now Aeschylus has fitted a whole tragedy to this\n\t\t\t\t\tstory, giving it the title of The Weighing of Souls, and has placed beside\n\t\t\t\t\tthe scales of Zeus on the one side Thetis, and on the other Dawn, entreating\n\t\t\t\t\tfor their sons who are fighting. But it is patent to everybody that this is\n\t\t\t\t\ta mythical fabrication which has been created to please or astound the\n\t\t\t\t\thearer. But in the lines  and  we have at last statements in accord with their\n\t\t\t\t\topinion and belief, as they thus publish to us and try to make us share\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir delusion and ignorance  regarding the gods. Then\n\t\t\t\t\tagain the monstrous tales of visits to the shades, and the descriptions,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich in awful language create spectres and pictures of blazing rivers and\n\t\t\t\t\thideous places and grim punishments, do not blind very many people to the\n\t\t\t\t\tfact that fable and falsehood in plenty have been mingled with them like\n\t\t\t\t\tpoison in nourishing food. And not Homer nor Pindar nor Sophocles really\n\t\t\t\t\tbelieved that these things are so when they wrote :  and  and  However, take the case of those who, bewailing\n\t\t\t\t\tand fearing death as something piteous, or want of burial as something\n\t\t\t\t\tterrible, have given utterance to sentiments like these :  and  and  These are the\n\t\t\t\t\tvoices of persons affected by emotion  and prepossessed by\n\t\t\t\t\topinions and delusions. For this reason such sentiments take a more powerful\n\t\t\t\t\thold on us and disturb us the more, inasmuch as we become infected by their\n\t\t\t\t\temotions and by the weakness from whence they proceed. Against these\n\t\t\t\t\tinfluences, then, once more let us equip the young from the very outset to\n\t\t\t\t\tkeep ever sounding in their ears the maxim, that the art of poetry is not\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatly concerned with the truth, and that the truth about these matters,\n\t\t\t\t\teven for those who have made it their sole business to search out and\n\t\t\t\t\tunderstand the verities, is exceedingly hard to track down and hard to get\n\t\t\t\t\thold of, as they themselves admit; and let these words of Empedocles be\n\t\t\t\t\tconstantly in mind:  and the words\n\t\t\t\t\tof Xenophanes:  and by all means the\n\t\t\t\t\twords of Socrates, in Plato, when he solemnly disavows all acquaintance with these\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects.

And let him not  merely\n\t\t\t\t\tbe acquainted with the oft-repeated saying that  but let us teach\n\t\t\t\t\thim in addition that when we see a lizard or an ape or the face of Thersites\n\t\t\t\t\tin a picture, we are pleased with it and admire it, not as a beautiful\n\t\t\t\t\tthing, but as a likeness. For by its essential nature the ugly cannot become\n\t\t\t\t\tbeautiful ; but the imitation, be it concerned with what is base or with\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is good, if only it attain to the likeness, is commended. If, on the\n\t\t\t\t\tother hand, it produces a beautiful picture of an ugly body, it fails to\n\t\t\t\t\tgive what propriety and probability require. Some painters even depict\n\t\t\t\t\tunnatural acts, as Timomachus painted a picture of Medea slaying her\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren, and Theon of Orestes slaying his mother, and Parrhasius of the\n\t\t\t\t\tfeigned madness of Odysseus, and Chaerephanes of the lewd commerce of women\n\t\t\t\t\twith men. In these matters it is especially necessary that the young man\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be trained by being taught that what we commend is not the action\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is the subject of the imitation, but the art, in case the subject in\n\t\t\t\t\thand has been properly imitated. Since, then, poetry also often gives an\n\t\t\t\t\timitative recital of base deeds, or of wicked experiences and characters,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe young man must not accept as true what is admired and successful\n\t\t\t\t\ttherein, nor approve it as beautiful, but should simply commend it as\n\t\t\t\t\tfitting and proper to the character in hand. For just as when we hear the\n\t\t\t\t\tsquealing of a pig, the creaking of a windlass, the whistling of the winds,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the booming of the sea, we are uneasy and annoyed ; but if anybody gives\n\t\t\t\t\ta plausible imitation of these, as Parmeno imitated a pig, and Theodorus a\n\t\t\t\t\twindlass, we are pleased ; and just as we avoid a diseased and ulcerous\n\t\t\t\t\tperson  as an unpleasant sight, but take delight in seeing\n\t\t\t\t\tAristophon's Philoctetes and Silanion's Jocasta, who are represented on the\n\t\t\t\t\tstage as pining away or dying ; so too the young man, as he reads what\n\t\t\t\t\tThersites the buffoon, or Sisyphus the seducer of women, or Batrachus the\n\t\t\t\t\tbawd, is represented as saying or doing, must be taught to commend the\n\t\t\t\t\tfaculty and art which imitates these things, but to repudiate and condemn\n\t\t\t\t\tthe disposition and the actions which it imitates. For it is not the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthing at all to imitate something beautiful and something beautifully, since\n\t\t\t\t\t means  and ugly things are  for the\n\t\t\t\t\tugly. Witness the boots made for the crippled feet of Damonidas, who prayed\n\t\t\t\t\tonce, when he had lost them, that the man who had stolen them might have\n\t\t\t\t\tfeet which they would fit; they were sorry boots, it is true, but they\n\t\t\t\t\tfitted their owner. Consider the following lines :  and  and  These, it is true, are wicked and fallacious\n\t\t\t\t\tsentiments,  but fitting respectively for Eteocles, Ixion,\n\t\t\t\t\tand an old usurer. If then we remind our sons that authors write them, not\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they commend or approve them, but with the idea of investing mean\n\t\t\t\t\tand unnatural characters and persons with unnatural and mean sentiments,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey could not be harmed by the opinions of poets ; nay, on the contrary,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe suspicion felt against the person in question discredits both his\n\t\t\t\t\tactions and words, as being mean because spoken or done by a mean man. Of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch sort is the account of Paris in his wife's arms after his cowardly\n\t\t\t\t\tescape from battle. For since the poet represents no other save this\n\t\t\t\t\tlicentious and adulterous man as dallying with a woman in the daytime, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear that he classes such sensuality as a shame and reproach."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "4", "p": [{"quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Com.

His favourable introductions are after this manner :  and \n\t\t\t\t\t           But in discrediting in advance, he all but protests\n\t\t\t\t\tand proclaims that we are not to follow or heed the sentiments expressed, as\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing unjustifiable and mean. For example, when he is on the point of\n\t\t\t\t\tnarrating Agamemnon's harsh treatment of the priest, he says in advance,\n\t\t\t\t\t that is to say, savagely and wilfully and\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to what he should have done ; and in Achilles' mouth he puts the\n\t\t\t\t\tbold words,  but he intimates his own judgement in saying,  hence\n\t\t\t\t\tit is likely that nothing spoken with anger and severity can be good. In\n\t\t\t\t\tlike manner also, he comments upon actions :  He also employs his\n\t\t\t\t\tclosing lines to good purpose, as though adding a sort of verdict of his own\n\t\t\t\t\tto what is done or said. Of the adultery of Ares, he represents the gods as\n\t\t\t\t\tsaying,  and on the occasion of Hector's great arrogance\n\t\t\t\t\tand boasting he says, \n\t\t\t\t\t           and regarding Pandarus's archery,  Now these declarations and opinions contained in the\n\t\t\t\t\twords of the text may be discovered by anybody who will pay attention, but\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the actions themselves the poets supply other lessons : as, for\n\t\t\t\t\texample, Euripides is reported to have said to those who railed at his Ixion\n\t\t\t\t\tas an impious and detestable character,  In Homer\n\t\t\t\t\tthis form of instruction is given silently, but it leaves room for a\n\t\t\t\t\treconsideration, which is helpful in the case of those stories which have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen most discredited. By forcibly distorting these stories through what\n\t\t\t\t\tused to be termed  but are nowadays called\n\t\t\t\t\t some persons say that the\n\t\t\t\t\tSun is represented as giving information about Aphrodite in the arms of\n\t\t\t\t\tAres, because the conjunction of the planet Mars with Venus portends births\n\t\t\t\t\tconceived in adultery, and when the sun returns in his course and discovers\n\t\t\t\t\tthese, they cannot be kept secret. And Hera's beautifying of herself for\n\t\t\t\t\tZeus's eyes, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tcharms connected with the girdle, such persons will have it, are a sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tpurification of the air as it draws near the fiery element;\u2014as though the\n\t\t\t\t\tpoet himself did not afford the right solutions. For, in the account of\n\t\t\t\t\tAphrodite, he teaches those who will pay attention that vulgar music, coarse\n\t\t\t\t\tsongs, and stories treating of vile themes, create licentious characters,\n\t\t\t\t\tunmanly lives, and men that love luxury, soft living, intimacy with women,\n\t\t\t\t\tand \n\t\t\t\t\t           This too is the reason why he has represented\n\t\t\t\t\tOdysseus as bidding the harper  thus admirably indicating\n\t\t\t\t\tthe duty of musicians and poets to take the subjects of their compositions\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the lives of those who are discreet and sensible. And in his account of\n\t\t\t\t\tHera, he has shown excellently well how the favour that women win by\n\t\t\t\t\tphilters and enchantments and the attendant deceit in their relations with\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir husbands, not only is transitory and soon sated and unsure, but\n\t\t\t\t\tchanges also to anger and enmity, so soon as the pleasurable excitement has\n\t\t\t\t\tfaded away. Such, in fact, are Zeus's angry threats as he speaks to Hera in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis wise : \n\t\t\t\t\tFor the description and portrayal of mean actions, if it also represent as\n\t\t\t\t\tit should the disgrace and injury resulting to the doers thereof, benefits\n\t\t\t\t\tinstead of injuring the hearer. Philosophers, at any rate, for admonition\n\t\t\t\t\tand instruction, use examples taken from known facts; but the poets\n\t\t\t\t\taccomplish the same result by inventing actions of their own imagination,\n\t\t\t\t\tand by recounting mythical tales. Thus it was Melanthius who said, whether\n\t\t\t\t\tin jest or in earnest, that the Athenian State was perpetually preserved by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe quarrelling and disorder among its public speakers ; for they were not\n\t\t\t\t\tall inclined to crowd to the same side of the boat, and so, in the\n\t\t\t\t\tdisagreement  of the politicians, there was ever some\n\t\t\t\t\tcounterpoise to the harmful. And so the mutual contrarieties of the poets,\n\t\t\t\t\trestoring our belief to its proper balance, forbid any strong turning of the\n\t\t\t\t\tscale toward the harmful. When therefore a comparison of passages makes\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir contradictions evident, we must advocate the better side, as in the\n\t\t\t\t\tfollowing examples :  as\n\t\t\t\t\tcompared with  and again  as compared with  and  as\n\t\t\t\t\tcompared with  For such passages as these admit of solutions\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are obvious, if, as has been said, we direct the young, by the use of\n\t\t\t\t\tcriticism, toward the better side. But whenever anything said by such\n\t\t\t\t\tauthors sounds preposterous, and no solution is found close at hand, we must\n\t\t\t\t\tnullify its effect by something said by them elsewhere to the opposite\n\t\t\t\t\teffect, and we should not be offended or angry at the poet, but with the\n\t\t\t\t\twords, which are spoken in character and with humorous intent. As an obvious\n\t\t\t\t\tillustration, if you wish, over against Homer's accounts of the gods  being cast forth by one another, their being wounded by\n\t\t\t\t\tmen, their disagreements, and their displays of ill-temper, you may set the\n\t\t\t\t\tline :  and indeed elsewhere you do think of\n\t\t\t\t\tbetter things and say more seemly things, such as these :  and  and  These,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, are sound opinions about gods, and true, but those other accounts have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen fabricated to excite men's astonishment. Again, when Euripides says,\n\t\t\t\t\t it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tbad to subjoin,  which is a better saying of his. And when\n\t\t\t\t\tPindar very bitterly and exasperatingly has said, \n\t\t\t\t\t           we may reply,  a=\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd when Sophocles has said, \n               \n\t\t\t\t\twe may say,  And over\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst those statements about wealth :  he will set many of\n\t\t\t\t\tSophocles' words, among which are the following :  and  and  And Menander certainly exalted the love of\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure,  with a suggestion of boastfulness too, in\n\t\t\t\t\tthese glowing lines that refer to love : \n\t\t\t\t\tBut at another time he turns us about and draws us towards the good, and\n\t\t\t\t\tuproots the boldness of licentiousness, by saying:  The latter sentiment is\n\t\t\t\t\tquite opposed to the former, and it is better and more useful. Such\n\t\t\t\t\tcomparison and consideration of opposing sentiments will result in one of\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo ways : it will either guide the youth over toward the better side, or\n\t\t\t\t\telse cause his belief to revolt from the worse."}, {"q": [{"@rend": "italics", "@direct": "unspecified", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Ibid."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Alexis"}], "#text": "ii., , No. 271."}, "#text": "The man of sense must gather pleasure's fruits, And three\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere are which have the potency Truly to be of import for this life\u2014 To\n\t\t\t\t\t\teat and drink and have one's way in love, All else must be declared\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccessory,"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "pb": {"@id": "v1.p.113"}, "#text": "base men live to eat  and drink, and good men\n\t\t\t\t\t\teat and drink to live."}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "By proving\n\t\t\t\t\t\thonourable and upright himself."}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "What!

To take an obvious example, it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Archilochus, when he says in his prayer, \n\t\t\t\t\tis calling on the god himself; but when, lamenting his sister's husband who\n\t\t\t\t\twas lost at sea and received no formal burial, he says that he could have\n\t\t\t\t\tborne the calamity with greater moderation,  it is fire\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he called by this name and not the god. And again when Euripides  said\n\t\t\t\t\tin an oath,  he named the gods\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves ; but when Sophocles  says,  the name is to be\n\t\t\t\t\tunderstood as meaning war ; just as again it suggests weapons of bronze in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe passage where Homer  says,  Since, then, many\n\t\t\t\t\twords are used in this way, it is \n\t\t\t\t\t necessary to know and to remember that under the name\n\t\t\t\t\tZeus also (or Zen) the poets address sometimes the god, sometimes Fortune,\n\t\t\t\t\tand oftentimes Fate. For when they say,  and  they mean the god himself; but when they apply the\n\t\t\t\t\tname of Zeus to the causes of all that happens, and say,  they mean\n\t\t\t\t\tFate. For the poet does not imagine that it is the god who contrives evils\n\t\t\t\t\tfor mankind, but by the name he rightly implies the compelling force of\n\t\t\t\t\tcircumstances, that States and armies and leaders, if they show\n\t\t\t\t\tself-control, are destined to succeed and to prevail over their enemies, but\n\t\t\t\t\tif they fall into passions and errors, if they disagree and quarrel among\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, as these heroes did, then are they destined to act discreditably\n\t\t\t\t\tand to become disorganized and to come to a bad end, as Sophocles says :\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tand certainly Hesiod  in representing Prometheus as exhorting Epimetheus\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n                employs the name of Zeus as a synonym for the power of\n\t\t\t\t\tFortune. For he has given the name of  to the\n\t\t\t\t\tblessings of Fortune, such as wealth, marriage, office, and, in a word, all\n\t\t\t\t\toutward things, the possession of which is unprofitable to those who cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tmake good use of them. Wherefore he thinks that Epimetheus, who is a\n\t\t\t\t\tworthless man and a fool, ought to be on his guard against any piece of good\n\t\t\t\t\tfortune, and be fearful of it, as he is likely to be injured and corrupted\n\t\t\t\t\tby it. And again when the poet says,  he now speaks of what happens by chance as godgiven, with the\n\t\t\t\t\tsuggestion that it is not meet to impugn those who are poor through\n\t\t\t\t\tmisfortune, but to reproach the penury that is accompanied by laziness, soft\n\t\t\t\t\tliving, and extravagance, since then it is disgraceful and reprehensible.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor at a time when men did not as yet use the name \n\t\t\t\t\tbut knew the force of causation as it traverses its irregular and\n\t\t\t\t\tindeterminate course, so strong, so impossible for human reason to guard\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst, they tried to express this by the names of the gods, exactly as we\n\t\t\t\t\tare wont to call deeds and characters, and in fact even words and men,\n\t\t\t\t\t and  In this manner, then,\n\t\t\t\t\ta corrective is to be found for most of the seemingly unjustifiable\n\t\t\t\t\tstatements regarding Zeus, among which are the following :  and  \n                and  These are to be\n\t\t\t\t\tinterpreted as referring to Fortune or Fate, in which guise are denoted\n\t\t\t\t\tthose phases of causation which baffle our logic, and are, in a word, beyond\n\t\t\t\t\tus. But wherever there is appropriateness, reason, and probability in the\n\t\t\t\t\tuse of the name, let us believe that there the god himself is meant, as in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe following :  and"}, {"q": [{"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "virtue."}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "olives"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "chestnuts,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "@direct": "unspecified", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Il."}, "#text": "Homer,  xx. 242."}, "#text": "Zeus makes virtue in men both to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincrease and diminish,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "@direct": "unspecified", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Works and Days"}, "#text": "Hesiod, , 313."}, "#text": "Virtue and glory are attendant on riches,"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "sit"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "amazed"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "virtue"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "evil"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "happiness"}], "pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.129"}, {"@id": "v1.p.131"}, {"@id": "v1.p.133"}], "quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Works and Days"}, "#text": "Hesiod, , 289."}, "#text": "Sweat the gods have set before the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattainment of virtue,"}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Il."}, "#text": "Homer,  xi. 90."}, "#text": "Then the Greeks by their virtue broke the line of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir foemen,"}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Trag.

An example is the word  For inasmuch\n\t\t\t\t\tas virtue not only renders men sensible, honest, and upright in actions and\n\t\t\t\t\twords, but also often enough secures for them repute and influence, \n\t\t\t\t\t the poets, following this notion, make good repute and\n\t\t\t\t\tinfluence to be virtue, giving them this name in exactly the same way that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe products of the olive and the chestnut are called  and  the same names as the trees that\n\t\t\t\t\tbear them. So then when poets say,  and  and  let our young man at once feel that these sayings\n\t\t\t\t\trelate to the best and godliest estate to which we can attain, which we\n\t\t\t\t\tthink of as correctness of reasoning, the height of good sense, and a\n\t\t\t\t\tdisposition of soul in full agreement therewith. But when at another time,\n\t\t\t\t\tin his reading, he finds this line,  or this, \n\t\t\t\t\tlet him not  astounded and  at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rich, as though they were able to purchase virtue without ado for money,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor let him believe either that the increase or diminution of his own wisdom\n\t\t\t\t\trests with Fortune, but let him consider that the poet has employed  instead of repute, or influence, or good fortune, or the\n\t\t\t\t\tlike. For assuredly \n\t\t\t\t\t by  the poets sometimes signify\n\t\t\t\t\tbadness in its strict sense, and wickedness of soul, as when Hesiod  says,\n\t\t\t\t\tEvil may always be had by all mankind in abundance, and sometimes some other\n\t\t\t\t\taffliction or misfortune, as when Homer  says, Since full soon do mortals\n\t\t\t\t\twho live in evil grow aged. And so too anybody would be sadly deceived,\n\t\t\t\t\tshould he imagine that the poets give to  the\n\t\t\t\t\tsense which the philosophers give to it, namely, that of complete possession\n\t\t\t\t\tor attainment of good, or the perfection of a life gliding smoothly along in\n\t\t\t\t\taccord with nature, and that the poets do not oftentimes by a perversion of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe word call the rich man happy and blessed, and call influence or repute\n\t\t\t\t\thappiness. Now Homer  has used the words correctly :  and so has Menander : \n                But Euripides  works\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch disturbance and confusion when he says,  and \n\t\t\t\t\t \n               \n\t\t\t\t\tunless, as has been said, one follows the figurative and perverted use of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe words.

This is the reason why the imitation that\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not show an utter disregard of the truth brings out, along with the\n\t\t\t\t\tactions, indications of both vice and virtue commingled ; as is the case\n\t\t\t\t\twith that of Homer, which emphatically says good-bye to the Stoics, who will\n\t\t\t\t\thave it that nothing base can attach to virtue, and nothing good to vice,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut that the ignorant man is quite wrong in all things, while, on the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand, the man of culture is right in everything.

For he will be greatly injured if\n\t\t\t\t\the approves everything, and is in a state of wonderment over it, but resents\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing, refusing even to listen or accept the opinion of him who, on the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary, censures persons that do and say such things as these:  and  and  and\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n               \n\t\t\t\t\tLet the young man, then, not get into the habit of commending anything like\n\t\t\t\t\tthis, nor let him be plausible and adroit in making excuses or in contriving\n\t\t\t\t\tsome specious quibbles to explain base actions, but rather let him cherish\n\t\t\t\t\tthe belief that poetry is an imitation of character and lives, and of men\n\t\t\t\t\twho are not perfect or spotless or unassailable in all respects, but\n\t\t\t\t\tpervaded by emotions, false opinions, and sundry forms of ignorance, who yet\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough inborn goodness frequently change their ways for the better. For if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe young man is so trained, and his understanding so framed, that he feels\n\t\t\t\t\telation and a sympathetic enthusiasm over noble words and deeds, and an\n\t\t\t\t\taversion and repugnance for the mean, such training will render his perusal\n\t\t\t\t\tof poetry harmless. But the man who admires everything, and accommodates\n\t\t\t\t\thimself to everything, whose judgement, because of his preconceived opinion,\n\t\t\t\t\tis enthralled by the heroic names, will, like those who copy Plato's stoop\n\t\t\t\t\tor Aristotle's lisp, unwittingly become inclined to conform to much that is\n\t\t\t\t\tbase. One ought not timorously, or as though under the spell of religious\n\t\t\t\t\tdread in a holy place, to shiver with awe at everything, and fall prostrate,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut should rather acquire the habit of exclaiming with confidence  and  no less than  and  For example, Achilles summons an\n\t\t\t\t\tassembly of the soldiers, who are suffering from an illness, since he is\n\t\t\t\t\tmost impatient of all over the slow progress of the war because of his\n\t\t\t\t\tconspicuous position and reputation on the field; moreover, because he has\n\t\t\t\t\tsome knowledge of medicine, and perceives now after the ninth day, on  which these maladies naturally reach their crisis, that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe disease is out of the ordinary and not the result of familiar causes, he\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not harangue the multitude when he rises to speak, but makes himself an\n\t\t\t\t\tadviser to the king :  Rightly, moderately, and properly is\n\t\t\t\t\tthis put. But after the seer has said that he fears the wrath of the most\n\t\t\t\t\tpowerful of the Greeks, Achilles no longer speaks rightly and moderately,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen he swears that nobody shall lay hands on the seer while he himself is\n\t\t\t\t\talive,  thus making plain his slight\n\t\t\t\t\tregard and his contempt for the leader. A moment later his irritation\n\t\t\t\t\tbecomes more acute, and his impulse is to draw his sword with intent to do\n\t\t\t\t\tmurder ; not rightly, either for honour or for expediency. Again, later,\n\t\t\t\t\trepenting,  this time rightly and honourably, because, although\n\t\t\t\t\the could not altogether eradicate his anger, yet before doing anything\n\t\t\t\t\tirreparable he put it aside and checked it by making it obedient to his\n\t\t\t\t\treason. Then again, although Agamemnon is ridiculous in his actions and\n\t\t\t\t\twords at the Assembly, yet in the incidents touching Chryseis he is more\n\t\t\t\t\tdignified and kingly. For whereas Achilles, as Briseis was being led away,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n                Agamemnon, as he in person put aboard the ship, and gave up\n\t\t\t\t\tand sent away, the woman of whom, a moment before, he has said that he cared\n\t\t\t\t\tmore for her than for his wedded wife, committed no amorous or disgraceful\n\t\t\t\t\tact. Then again, Phoenix, cursed by his father on account of the concubine,\n\t\t\t\t\tsays :  Now Aristarchus removed these lines from the\n\t\t\t\t\ttext through fear, but they are right in view of the occasion, since Phoenix\n\t\t\t\t\tis trying to teach Achilles what sort of a thing anger is, and how many wild\n\t\t\t\t\tdeeds men are ready to do from temper, if they do not use reason or hearken\n\t\t\t\t\tto those who try to soothe them. So also the poet introduces Meleager angry\n\t\t\t\t\tat his fellow-citizens, and later mollified, and he rightly finds fault with\n\t\t\t\t\this emotions, but, on the other hand, his refusal to yield, his resistance,\n\t\t\t\t\this mastery over them, and his change of heart the poet commends as good and\n\t\t\t\t\texpedient. Now in these cases the difference is manifest; but in cases where\n\t\t\t\t\tHomer's judgement is not made clear, a distinction is to be drawn by\n\t\t\t\t\tdirecting the young man's attention in some such manner as the following :\n\t\t\t\t\tIf, on the one hand, Nausicaa, after merely looking at a strange man,\n\t\t\t\t\tOdysseus, and experiencing Calypso's emotions toward him, being, as she was,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t a wanton child and at the age for marriage, utters such\n\t\t\t\t\tfoolish words as these to her maid-servants, \n\t\t\t\t\tthen are her boldness and lack of restraint to be blamed. But if, on the\n\t\t\t\t\tother hand, she sees into the character of the man from his words, and\n\t\t\t\t\tmarvels at his conversation, so full of good sense, and then prays that she\n\t\t\t\t\tmay be the consort of such a person rather than of some sailor man or\n\t\t\t\t\tdancing man of her own townsmen, then it is quite right to admire her. And\n\t\t\t\t\tagain, when Penelope enters into conversation with the suitors, not holding\n\t\t\t\t\therself aloof, and they favour her with gifts of garments and other apparel,\n\t\t\t\t\tOdysseus is pleased  If, on the one hand, he rejoices at the receipt of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe presents and the profit, then in his prostitution of his wife he outdoes\n\t\t\t\t\tPoliager, who is satirized in the comedy as  But if, on the other hand, he thinks that\n\t\t\t\t\the shall have them more in his power, while they are confident because of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir hopes and blind to the future, then his pleasure and confidence has a\n\t\t\t\t\treasonable justification. Similarly, in the enumeration of his possessions\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the Phaeacians had put ashore with him before they sailed away, if on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe one hand, upon finding himself in such solitude and in such uncertainty\n\t\t\t\t\tand ambiguity regarding his surroundings, he really fears about his\n\t\t\t\t\tpossessions,  \n                then it is quite right to pity or indeed even to loathe his\n\t\t\t\t\tavarice. But if, on the other hand, he, as some say, being of two minds\n\t\t\t\t\twhether he were in Ithaca, thinks that the safety of his possessions is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstration of the rectitude of the Phaeacians (for otherwise they would\n\t\t\t\t\tnot have carried him for nothing, put him ashore in a strange land, and left\n\t\t\t\t\thim there, at the same time keeping their hands off his possessions), then\n\t\t\t\t\the makes use of no mean proof, and it is quite right to praise his\n\t\t\t\t\tforethought. But some critics find fault also with the very act of putting\n\t\t\t\t\thim ashore, if this really was done while he was asleep, and assert that the\n\t\t\t\t\tEtruscans still preserve a tradition that Odysseus was naturally sleepy, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat for this reason most people found him difficult to converse with. Yet\n\t\t\t\t\tif his sleep was not real, but if, being ashamed to send away the Phaeacians\n\t\t\t\t\twithout gifts and entertainment, and at the same time unable to elude his\n\t\t\t\t\tenemies if the Phaeacians were in company with him, he provided himself with\n\t\t\t\t\ta cloak for his embarrassment in feigning himself asleep, then they find\n\t\t\t\t\tthis acceptable. By indicating these things to the young, we shall not allow\n\t\t\t\t\tthem to acquire any leaning toward such characters as are mean, but rather\n\t\t\t\t\tan emulation of the better, and a preference for them, if we unhesitatingly\n\t\t\t\t\taward censure to the one class and commendation to the other. It is\n\t\t\t\t\tparticularly necessary to do this with tragedies in which plausible and\n\t\t\t\t\tartful words are framed to accompany disreputable and knavish actions. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthe statement of Sophocles  is not altogether true when he says :  \n                For, as a\n\t\t\t\t\tfact, he is wont to provide for mean characters and unnatural actions\n\t\t\t\t\talluring words and humane reasons. And you observe also that his\n\t\t\t\t\tcompanion-at-arms in the dramatic art has represented Phaedra  as preferring\n\t\t\t\t\tthe charge against Theseus that it was because of his derelictions that she\n\t\t\t\t\tfell in love with Hippolytus. Of such sort, too, are the frank lines, aimed\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst Hecuba, which in the Trojan Women  he gives to Helen, who there\n\t\t\t\t\texpresses her feeling that Hecuba ought rather to be the one to suffer\n\t\t\t\t\tpunishment because she brought into the world the man who was the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tHelen's infidelity. Let the young man not form the habit of regarding any\n\t\t\t\t\tone of these things as witty and adroit, and let him not smile indulgently,\n\t\t\t\t\teither, at such displays of verbal ingenuity, but let him loathe the words\n\t\t\t\t\tof licentiousness even more than its deeds."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "9", "p": {"quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Works and Days"}, "#text": "Hesiod, , 744."}, "#text": "Never ought the ladle atop of the bowl to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\trested While the bout is on,"}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Il."}, "#text": "Homer,  iv. 306."}, "#text": "Whoso from his car can\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treach the car of another Let him thrust with his spear."}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Hippolytus"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Moralia"}], "#text": "Euripides, , 424; cited also by Plutarch in , 1 C."}, "#text": "A man, though bold, is made a slave whene'er\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe learns his mother's or his sire's disgrace,"}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Trag.

And it is not unprofitable to consider how the Trojans and\n\t\t\t\t\tHector were affected, at the time when Ajax was about to engage with him i\n\t\t\t\t\tsingle combat. Once when a boxer at the Isthmian games was struck in the\n\t\t\t\t\tface, and a clamour arose, Aeschylus  said,  In like manner, when the poet says  that when Ajax\n\t\t\t\t\tappeared resplendent in his armour, the Greeks rejoiced at seeing him,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas  who could fail to admire the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference ? For the heart of the man who is facing the danger only throbs,\n\t\t\t\t\tas though indeed he were simply going to wrestle or run a race, while the\n\t\t\t\t\tonlookers tremble and shiver in their whole bodies through loyalty and fear\n\t\t\t\t\tfor their king. Here, too, one should carefully consider the difference\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween the very valiant man and the craven. For Thersites  while Ajax was always friendly to\n\t\t\t\t\tAchilles, and says to Hector regarding him\u2014  This is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcompliment paid to Achilles, but these succeeding lines in behalf of all are\n\t\t\t\t\tput in such a way as to be useful: \n\t\t\t\t\t \n                thereby declaring himself not the only man or the best, but\n\t\t\t\t\tonly one among many equally capable of offering defence. This is enough on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subject of differences, unless perhaps we desire to add, that of the\n\t\t\t\t\tTrojans many were taken alive, but none of the Achaeans ; and that of the\n\t\t\t\t\tTrojans some fell down at the feet of the enemy, as did Adrastus, the sons \n\t\t\t\t\tof Antimachus, Lycaon, and Hector  himself begging Achilles for burial, but\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Achaeans none, because of their conviction that it is a trait of\n\t\t\t\t\tbarbarian peoples to make supplication and to fall at the enemy's feet in\n\t\t\t\t\tcombat, but of Greeks to conquer or to die fighting."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "11", "p": [{"note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Com.

After the same manner should\n\t\t\t\t\the that is fond of wine be on his guard against drunkenness, and he that is\n\t\t\t\t\tamorous against love. So did Agesilaus, who would not submit to being\n\t\t\t\t\tkissed by the handsome boy who approached him, so did Cyrus, who durst not\n\t\t\t\t\teven to look at Pantheia ; but the uneducated, on the contrary, gather fuel\n\t\t\t\t\tto kindle their passions, casting themselves headlong into those wherein\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are weakest and least sure of themselves.

While it is also necessary not to pass over the words carelessly,\n\t\t\t\t\tyet one should eschew the puerility of Cleanthes ; for there are times when\n\t\t\t\t\the uses a mock seriousness in pretending to interpret the words,  and  bidding us in the latter\n\t\t\t\t\tcase to read the last two words as one  (taking the word  as the preposition ) as though the vapour\n\t\t\t\t\texhaled from the earth were  because of its being\n\t\t\t\t\trendered up! And Chrysippus also is often quite petty, although he does not\n\t\t\t\t\tindulge in jesting, but wrests the words ingeniously, yet without carrying\n\t\t\t\t\tconviction, as when he would force the phrase \n\t\t\t\t\tson of Cronos  to signify  that is to\n\t\t\t\t\tsay, with a widespread power of speech."}, {"quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Il."}, "#text": "Homer,  vi. 444."}, "#text": "Nor does my heart so bid me, for I have learned to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvaliant,"}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Ibid."}, "#text": "xvii. 671."}, "#text": "For towards all he understood the way to be gentle."}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Ibid."}, "#text": "xiii. 354."}, "#text": "Both, indeed, were of one descent and of the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbirthplace, Yet was Zeus the earlier born and his knowledge was wider."}], "#text": "It is better, however, to turn these matters over to the grammarians, and to\n\t\t\t\t\thold fast rather to those in which is to be found both usefulness and\n\t\t\t\t\tprobability, such as  and  For by\n\t\t\t\t\tdeclaring that bravery is a thing to be learned, and by expressing the\n\t\t\t\t\tbelief that friendly and gracious intercourse with others proceeds from\n\t\t\t\t\tunderstanding, and is in keeping with reason, the poet urges us not to\n\t\t\t\t\tneglect our own selves, but to learn what is good, and to give heed to our\n\t\t\t\t\tteachers, intimating that both boorishness and cowardice are but ignorance\n\t\t\t\t\tand defects of learning.

Timotheus  also adopted this\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint of view, when in his Persians he urged the Greeks, not infelicitously,\n\t\t\t\t\tto have  and Aeschylus  sets\n\t\t\t\t\tit down as a point of good sense not to be puffed up with fame, nor to be\n\t\t\t\t\texcited and elated by popular praise, when he writes of Amphiaraus,  For to take pride in oneself\n\t\t\t\t\tand in one's state of mind when it is altogether good, marks the man of good\n\t\t\t\t\tsense; and since everything may be referred to understanding, it follows\n\t\t\t\t\tthat every form of virtue is added unto him from reason and instruction."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "12", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.173"}, {"@id": "v1.p.175"}, {"@id": "v1.p.179"}], "quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Il."}, "#text": "Homer,  xxiii. 297."}, "#text": "Gift so he fare not with him to Troy where the wind\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnever ceaseth, But enjoy himself at home; for wealth in abundance Zeus had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbestowed upon him."}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Poet.

For example,\n\t\t\t\t\tAgamemnon is suspected of having, for a bribe, released from service in the\n\t\t\t\t\tarmy the rich man who made him a present of the mare Aetha,\n\t\t\t\t\t \n                But, as Aristotle  observes, he did quite right in\n\t\t\t\t\tpreferring a good mare to a man of that type. For a coward, and a weakling,\n\t\t\t\t\tmade dissolute by wealth and soft living, is not, I swear, worth a dog or\n\t\t\t\t\teven an ass. Again, it appears most shameful in Thetis  when she incites her\n\t\t\t\t\tson to pleasures and reminds him of love. But even there we must contrast\n\t\t\t\t\tAchilles' mastery of himself, that although he is in love with Briseis, who\n\t\t\t\t\thas come back to him, and although he knows that the end of his life is\n\t\t\t\t\tnear, yet he does not make haste to enjoy love's pleasures, nor, like most\n\t\t\t\t\tmen, mourn for his friend by inactivity and omission of his duties, but as\n\t\t\t\t\the refrains from such pleasures because of his grief, so he bestirs himself\n\t\t\t\t\tin the business of his command. Again, Archilochus cannot be commended,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause while grieving over his sister's husband, who was lost at sea, he is\n\t\t\t\t\tminded to fight against his grief by means of wine and amusement; he has,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, alleged a cause that has some appearance of reason,  For if he thought that he should not make matters  how shall our present\n\t\t\t\t\tcondition be any the worse if we engage in the study of philosophy or take\n\t\t\t\t\tpart in public life, if we go out to the market-place or down to the\n\t\t\t\t\tAcademy, or if we pursue our farming ? Wherefore the corrected versions\n\t\t\t\t\twhich Cleanthes \n\t\t\t\t\t and Antisthenes employed are themselves not without\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue. Antisthenes, observing that the Athenians had raised an uproar in the\n\t\t\t\t\ttheatre at the line,  at once\n\t\t\t\t\tinterpolated,  and Cleanthes,\n\t\t\t\t\ttaking the lines about riches,  rewrote them in this manner,  And Zeno in amending the lines of\n\t\t\t\t\tSophocles,  rewrote it thus :  by the word\n\t\t\t\t\t as he now uses it designating the man who is\n\t\t\t\t\tfearless, high-minded, and unhumbled. What, then, is to hinder us also from\n\t\t\t\t\tencouraging the young to take the better course by means of similar\n\t\t\t\t\trejoinders, dealing with the citations something like this :  \n                will be our retort,  For to gain and achieve one's wish, if what one wishes is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot right, is pitiable and unenviable. Again,  \n                we shall say,  and : \n\t\t\t\t\t           we reply, \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd again : \n                And: \n\t\t\t\t\t \n                But it were better to say  Again :  \n                Such then is the system of amendment."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "13", "p": [{"note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Works and Days"}, "#text": "Hesiod, , 348."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Trag.

For, as physicians who\n\t\t\t\t\thave learnt the efficacy of a drug adapted to one malady take it over and\n\t\t\t\t\tuse it for every similar malady, so also when a statement has a general and\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal value, we ought not to suffer it to be fixed upon one matter\n\t\t\t\t\talone, but we ought to apply it to all the like, and inure the young men to\n\t\t\t\t\tsee its general value, and quickly to carry over what is appropriate, and by\n\t\t\t\t\tmany examples to give themselves training and practice in keen appreciation\n\t\t\t\t\t; so that when Menander says,  they may think of the statement as holding good also about repute\n\t\t\t\t\tand leadership and facility in speaking ; and so also that when they hear\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rebuke which was administered by Odysseus to Achilles as he sat among\n\t\t\t\t\tthe maidens in Scyrus,  they may imagine it to be addressed\n\t\t\t\t\talso to the profligate and the avaricious and the heedless and the ill-bred,\n\t\t\t\t\tas, for example,  or gamble, or\n\t\t\t\t\tfollow quail-fighting,  or petty trading, or the exacting of usury, without\n\t\t\t\t\ta thought of what is magnanimous or worthy of your noble parentage ?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n                Therefore speak not of repute, either, or of\n\t\t\t\t\tpersonal beauty, or the general's cloak, or the priestly crown, to all which\n\t\t\t\t\twe see the worst of men attaining.  and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same we may also aver of licentiousness, superstition, envy, and all the\n\t\t\t\t\tother pestilent disorders.

For,\n\t\t\t\t\tto begin with, in their greetings and salutations, they do not call one\n\t\t\t\t\tanother handsome or rich or strong, but they employ such fair words as\n\t\t\t\t\tthese\u2014  and  and  and  In the second place they reproach without touching at all upon\n\t\t\t\t\tbodily characteristics, but they direct their censure to faults :  and  and  and  and finally\n\t\t\t\t\tThersites is reproached  by Odysseus, not as lame or bald or hunchbacked,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut as indiscreet in his language, while on the other hand the mother of\n\t\t\t\t\tHephaestus affectionately drew an epithet from his lameness when she\n\t\t\t\t\taddressed him thus : \n\t\t\t\t\t \n                Thus Homer ridicules\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who feel ashamed of lameness or blindness, in that he does not regard\n\t\t\t\t\tas blameworthy that which is not shameful, or as shameful that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tbrought about, not through our own acts, but by fortune. Plainly, then, two\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat advantages accrue to those who accustom themselves carefully to peruse\n\t\t\t\t\tworks of poetry : the first is conducive to moderation, that we do not\n\t\t\t\t\todiously and foolishly reproach anybody with his fortune ; while the second\n\t\t\t\t\tis conducive to magnanimity, that when we ourselves have met with chances\n\t\t\t\t\tand changes we be not humiliated or even disturbed, but bear gently with\n\t\t\t\t\tscoffings and revilings and ridicule, having especially before us the words\n\t\t\t\t\tof Philemon :  But if anybody is plainly in need of\n\t\t\t\t\treprehension, we should reprehend his faults and his giving way to emotion,\n\t\t\t\t\tafter the fashion in which Adrastus of the tragedy, when Alcmaeon said to\n\t\t\t\t\thim,  replied  For just as those who scourge the clothes\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not \n\t\t\t\t\t touch the body, so those who scoff at misfortune or low\n\t\t\t\t\tbirth, do but vainly and foolishly assail externals, never touching the soul\n\t\t\t\t\tor even such matters as really need correction and stinging reproof."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "14", "p": [{"quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Il."}, "#text": "Homer,  v. 428."}, "#text": "You, my child, have not the gift of arms in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle, Your concern must be for loving arms in wedlock,"}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Iliad"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "supra."}], "#text": "Not found in the MSS. of Homer but often printed as , xi. 543.
