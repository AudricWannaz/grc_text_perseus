A good plan, as it seems to me, Fundanus, is that which painters follow : they scrutinize\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir productions from time to time before they\n\t\t\t\t\tfinish them. They do this because, by withdrawing\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir gaze and by inspecting their work often, they\n\t\t\t\t\tare able to form a fresh judgement, and one which is\n\t\t\t\t\tmore likely to seize upon any slight discrepancy,\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch as the familiarity of uninterrupted contemplation will conceal. Since, therefore, it is impossible\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a man to contemplate himself from time to time\n\t\t\t\t\tby getting apart from himself and interrupting his\n\t\t\t\t\tconsciousness of himself by breaking its continuity\n\t\t\t\t\t(and this is what, more than anything else, makes\n\t\t\t\t\tevery man a poorer judge of himself than of others),\n\t\t\t\t\tthe next best course would be for him to inspect\n\t\t\t\t\this friends from time to time and likewise to offer\n\t\t\t\t\thimself to them, not to see if he is grown old suddenly\n\t\t\t\t\tor if his body is better or worse, but for them to\n\t\t\t\t\texamine both his behaviour and his character to learn\n\t\t\t\t\twhether time has added some excellence or taken\n\t\t\t\t\taway some vice.

And yet - for I shall tell you the\n\t\t\t\t\tplain truth - when our friend Eros told me all this,\n\t\t\t\t\tI suspected that he was bearing witness, by reason\n\t\t\t\t\tof his goodwill, to qualities that were not actually\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent in you, yet should be so in men of breeding, although, as you know, he is by no means\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sort of man to surrender his own opinion as a\n\t\t\t\t\tfavour to anyone. But as things are, Eros stands\n\t\t\t\t\tacquitted of the charge of bearing false witness, and\n\t\t\t\t\tdo you, since our journey gives us leisure for conversation, tell me, as though you were recounting\n\t\t\t\t\tsome medical treatment, what remedy you used that\n\t\t\t\t\tyou have made your temper so obedient to the rein\n\t\t\t\t\tand tender-mouthed, so mild and subservient to\n\t\t\t\t\treason."}, {"pb": {"@id": "v.6.p.97"}, "note": {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Od."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "infra"}], "#text": ", xx. 23, cited in full 506 b, ."}, "#text": "Fundanus.

One of those excellent precepts\n\t\t\t\t\tof Musonius which I remember, Sulla, is :  For I do not think that reason should\n\t\t\t\t\tbe used in one's cure as we use hellebore, and be\n\t\t\t\t\twashed out of the body together with the disease,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut it must remain in the soul and keep watch\n\t\t\t\t\tand ward over the judgements. For the power\n\t\t\t\t\tof reason is not like drugs, but like wholesome\n\t\t\t\t\tfood, engendering an excellent state, together with\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat vigour, in those who become accustomed to\n\t\t\t\t\tit; but exhortations and admonitions, if applied\n\t\t\t\t\tto the passions when they are at their height and\n\t\t\t\t\tswollen, can scarcely accomplish anything at all,\n\t\t\t\t\tand that with difficulty. They are no better than\n\t\t\t\t\tthose aromatic preparations which rouse epileptics\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they lie prostrate, but do not rid them\n\t\t\t\t\tof the disease. Yet the other passions, even at\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir height, do in some sort yield and admit\n\t\t\t\t\treason, when it comes from without to the rescue,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tinto the soul; but temper does not, as Melanthius\n\t\t\t\t\tsays,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tbut on the contrary, it shuts out sense completely and\n\t\t\t\t\tlocks it out, and just like those who burn themselves up in their own homes, it makes everything\n\t\t\t\t\twithin full of confusion and smoke and noise, so that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe soul can neither see nor hear anything that might\n\t\t\t\t\thelp it. For this reason a ship deserted by her crew\n\t\t\t\t\tin the midst of a storm far out at sea will more\n\t\t\t\t\teasily be able to take on a pilot from the outside, than\n\t\t\t\t\twill a man who is being tossed upon the billows of\n\t\t\t\t\tpassion and anger admit the reasoning of another,\n\t\t\t\t\tunless he has his own powers of reason prepared to\n\t\t\t\t\treceive it. But just as those who expect a siege\n\t\t\t\t\tcollect and store up all that is useful to them if they\n\t\t\t\t\tdespair of relief from without, so it is most important\n\t\t\t\t\tthat we should acquire far in advance the reinforcements which philosophy provides against temper and\n\t\t\t\t\tconvey them into the soul in the knowledge that,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the occasion for using them comes, it will not\n\t\t\t\t\tbe possible to introduce them with ease. For the\n\t\t\t\t\tsoul hears nothing from the outside because of its\n\t\t\t\t\ttumult unless it has its own reason within, which, like\n\t\t\t\t\ta boatswain who directs the rowers, will promptly\n\t\t\t\t\tcatch and understand every order given. Yet if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe soul has heard words of advice which have been\n\t\t\t\t\tquietly and mildly spoken, it despises them; and\n\t\t\t\t\ttoward any who insist in a rougher fashion, it grows\n\t\t\t\t\texasperated. In fact, temper is overbearing and\n\t\t\t\t\tstubborn and altogether difficult for anyone other\n\t\t\t\t\tthan itself to move, and, like a well-fortified tyranny,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tmust have its destroyer born and bred in the same\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "3", "p": [{"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Republic"}], "#text": "Plato, , 411 b-c."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "At the battle of Leuctra, 371 b.c."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Problemata"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "De Partibus Animalium"}], "#text": "This is apparently from a lost work, though not included in Rose's collection of fragments.

The ease of Gaius\n\t\t\t\t\tGracchus the orator will serve as illustration. He\n\t\t\t\t\twas not only severe in his disposition, but spoke too\n\t\t\t\t\tpassionately; so he caused a pitch-pipe to be made\n\t\t\t\t\tof the sort which musicians use to lead the voice up\n\t\t\t\t\tand down the scales to the proper note; with this\n\t\t\t\t\tin hand his servant used to stand behind him as he\n\t\t\t\t\tspoke and give him a decorous and gentle tone which\n\t\t\t\t\tenabled Gracchus to remit his loud cries and remove\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom his voice the harsh and passionate element; just\n\t\t\t\t\tas the shepherds'\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tso did he charm and lay to rest the rage of the orator.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut as for me, if I had some attentive and clever\n\t\t\t\t\tcompanion, I should not be vexed if he held a mirror\n\t\t\t\t\tup to me during my moments of rage, as they do for\n\t\t\t\t\tsome persons after bathing, though to no useful purpose. For to see oneself in a state which nature did\n\t\t\t\t\tnot intend, with one's features all distorted, contributes in no small degree toward discrediting that\n\t\t\t\t\tpassion. In fact, those who delight in pleasant fables\n\t\t\t\t\ttell us that when Athena played on the pipes, she\n\t\t\t\t\twas rebuked by the satyr and would give no heed :\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tbut when she saw her face in a river, she was vexed\n\t\t\t\t\tand threw her pipes away.

For it is impossible that irresponsible power\n\t\t\t\t\tunder the influence of passion should be free from\n\t\t\t\t\terror, unless he who wields this power shall encompass it with a bulwark of gentleness, and shall hold\n\t\t\t\t\tout against many pleas of wife and friends, all\n\t\t\t\t\tcharging him with laxity and easy-going ways. By\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch charges I myself used to be very greatly exasperated against my slaves, in the conviction that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey were being ruined by not being punished. At\n\t\t\t\t\tlong last, however, though late it was, I came to\n\t\t\t\t\tperceive that, in the first place, it is better to make\n\t\t\t\t\tthem worse by forbearance than by harshness and\n\t\t\t\t\tanger to pervert my own self for the correction of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe others. In the second place, when I observed\n\t\t\t\t\tthat many, just because they were not being punished, were often ashamed to be bad, and made\n\t\t\t\t\tpardon, rather than correction, the starting-point\n\t\t\t\t\tof reformation, and, I swear, performed their duties\n\t\t\t\t\tmore zealously for the kind of master who gave\n\t\t\t\t\torders silently with a nod than for the others who\n\t\t\t\t\tused blows and branding-irons, I began to be convinced that reason is more fit than anger to govern.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor it is not as the Poet has said,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tbut, on the contrary, in those who revere there is\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tengendered the kind of fear that corrects behaviour,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas continual and unmerciful beating produces,\n\t\t\t\t\tnot repentance for wrongdoing, but rather the farsighted cunning to do wrong without detection. In\n\t\t\t\t\tthe third place, I always keep in mind and reflect in\n\t\t\t\t\tprivacy that he who taught us the use of the bow did\n\t\t\t\t\tnot forbid us to shoot, but only to miss the mark, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the infliction of punishment will not be hindered\n\t\t\t\t\tby our teaching how to inflict it at the right time, with\n\t\t\t\t\tmoderation, and in a useful and suitable manner ;\n\t\t\t\t\tand, remembering these things, I try to get rid of my\n\t\t\t\t\tanger, if possible, by not depriving those who are to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe punished of the right to speak in their defence, but\n\t\t\t\t\tby listening to their plea. For both the passage of\n\t\t\t\t\ttime gives a pause to passion and a delay which dissolves it, and also the judgement discovers a suitable\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner of punishment and an adequate amount ;\n\t\t\t\t\tfurthermore, the man who suffers punishment has no\n\t\t\t\t\tpretext left for opposing the correction if punishment\n\t\t\t\t\tis inflicted, not in anger, but after the accused has\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen proved guilty ; and finally, the most shameful\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is avoided-that the slave should seem to be\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking a juster plea than his master."}, {"note": {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf.

As for my own temperament,\n\t\t\t\t\tyou doubtless know how strong are the impulses\n\t\t\t\t\twhich incline it to be of goodwill toward my fellowmen and to trust them. Consequently, like men\n\t\t\t\t\twho attempt to walk on empty air, the more I give\n\t\t\t\t\tmyself up to loving a person the more I go astray, and\n\t\t\t\t\twhen I stumble and fall, the greater my distress ; and\n\t\t\t\t\talthough I may no longer be able to reduce my too\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat propensity and eagerness to love, yet I may\n\t\t\t\t\tperhaps be able to use Plato's caution as a curb\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst excessive trust. For Plato says that he praises\n\t\t\t\t\tHelicon the mathematician in such terms as he uses\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause man is by nature an animal readily subject\n\t\t\t\t\tto change ; and that he does well to fear those who\n\t\t\t\t\thave been educated in the city lest, being men and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe seeds of men, they may reveal somewhere the\n\t\t\t\t\tweakness inherent in their nature. But when\n\t\t\t\t\tSophocles says\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\the seems to go too far in trampling upon and belittling\n\t\t\t\t\tus. This peevish and censorious judgement does,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, tend to make us more considerate in our\n\t\t\t\t\toutbursts of temper ; for it is the sudden and the\n\t\t\t\t\tunexpected that throw men off their bearings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t          \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut we should, as Panaetius also has somewhere\n\t\t\t\t\tremarked, make use of the precept of Anaxagoras,\n\t\t\t\t\tand just as he, at the death of his son, said,  ; so on each occasion\n\t\t\t\t\twe should remark with reference to the faults which\n\t\t\t\t\texasperate us :  \n                \n                And if we keep repeating to ourselves Plato's question, \n                and turn our reason inward\n\t\t\t\t\tinstead of to external things, and substitute caution\n\t\t\t\t\tfor censoriousness, we shall no longer make much use\n\t\t\t\t\tof  toward others when we\n\t\t\t\t\tobserve that we ourselves stand in need of much\n\t\t\t\t\tindulgence. But as it is, everyone of us, when we are\n\t\t\t\t\tangry and inflicting punishment, brings out the injunctions of an Aristeides or a Cato : \n\t\t\t\t\t           \n                ; and -\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is most disgraceful of all - while angry we chide\n\t\t\t\t\tothers for being angry and punish by rage faults\n\t\t\t\t\twhich have been committed in a rage, not like\n\t\t\t\t\tphysicians, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tbut rather make more intense the malady and\n\t\t\t\t\taggravate it."}, {"pb": {"@id": "v.6.p.157"}, "note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Trag.
