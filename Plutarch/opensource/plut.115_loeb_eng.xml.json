Certainly if a physician\n\t\t\t\t\tis a man of high ideals, he will be better pleased to\n\t\t\t\t\tcure the eye which sees for many and watches over\n\t\t\t\t\tmany, and a philosopher will be more eager to attend\n\t\t\t\t\tupon a soul which he sees is solicitous for many and\n\t\t\t\t\tis under obligation to be wise and self-restrained\n\t\t\t\t\tand just in behalf of many. For surely, if he were\n\t\t\t\t\tskilled in discovering and collecting water, as they\n\t\t\t\t\tsay Heracles and many of the ancients were, he\n\t\t\t\t\twould not delight in digging the swineherd's fount\n\t\t\t\t\tof Arethusa in a most distant spot  but in uncovering the unfailing sources of\n\t\t\t\t\tsome river for cities and camps and the plantations\n\t\t\t\t\tof kings and sacred groves. So we hear Homer\n\t\t\t\t\tcalling Minos  which\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans, according to Plato, \n                For they did not think that pupils of the\n\t\t\t\t\tgods should be plain citizens or stay-at-homes or\n\t\t\t\t\tidlers, but kings, from whose good counsel, justice,\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness, and high-mindedness, if those qualities\n\t\t\t\t\twere implanted in them, all who had to do with\n\t\t\t\t\tthem would receive benefit and profit. Of the\n\t\t\t\t\tplant  they say that if one goat take it in\n\t\t\t\t\tits mouth, first that goat itself and then the entire\n\t\t\t\t\therd stands still until the herdsman comes and takes\n\t\t\t\t\tthe plant out, such pungency, like a fire which spreads\n\t\t\t\t\tover everything near it and scatters itself abroad, is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossessed by the emanations of its potency. Certainly the teachings of the philosopher, if they take\n\t\t\t\t\thold of one person in private station who enjoys\n\t\t\t\t\tabstention from affairs and circumscribes himself by\n\t\t\t\t\this bodily comforts, as by a circle drawn with geometrical compasses, do not spread out to others, but\n\t\t\t\t\tmerely create calmness and quiet in that one man,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen dry up and disappear. But if these teachings\n\t\t\t\t\ttake possession of a ruler, a statesman, and a man\n\t\t\t\t\tof action and fill him with love of honour, through\n\t\t\t\t\tone he benefits many, as Anaxagoras did by associating with Pericles, Plato with Dion, and Pythagoras\n\t\t\t\t\twith the chief men of the Italiote Greeks.

But Pindar says\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the Muse of oral utterance was  formerly, and I believe she is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot so now either, but because of lack of education\n\t\t\t\t\tand of good taste the \n                has become venal and ready for hire. For it cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\tthat, whereas Aphrodit was angry with the daughters\n\t\t\t\t\tof Propoetus because\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tyet Urania, Calliop, and Clio are pleased with those\n\t\t\t\t\twho pollute speech for money. No, I think the\n\t\t\t\t\tworks and gifts of the Muses are more conducive to\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship than are those of Aphrodit. For approbation, which some consider the end and purpose\n\t\t\t\t\tof speech, is admired as the beginning and seed of\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship ; but most people rather bestow reputation altogether by goodwill, believing that we praise\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthose only whom we love. But just as Ixion slipped\n\t\t\t\t\tinto the cloud when he was pursuing Hera, so these\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople seize upon a deceptive, showy, and shifting\n\t\t\t\t\tappearance in lieu of friendship. But the man of\n\t\t\t\t\tsense, if he is engaged in active political life, will ask\n\t\t\t\t\tfor so much reputation as will inspire confidence and\n\t\t\t\t\tthereby give him power for affairs ; for it is neither\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant nor easy to benefit people if they are unwilling, and confidence makes them willing. For\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as light is more a blessing to those who see than\n\t\t\t\t\tto those who are seen, so reputation is more a blessing to those who are aware of it than to those who\n\t\t\t\t\tare not overlooked. But he who has withdrawn\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom public affairs, who communes with himself\n\t\t\t\t\tand thinks happiness is in quiet and uninterrupted\n\t\t\t\t\tleisure, he, \n               \n\t\t\t\t\tthe reputation which is popular and widespread in\n\t\t\t\t\tcrowds and theatres, even as Hippolytus worshipped\n\t\t\t\t\tAphrodit, but even he does not despise reputation\n\t\t\t\t\tamong the right-minded and estimable ; but wealth,\n\t\t\t\t\treputation as a leader, or power in his friendships he\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not pursue, however neither does he avoid these\n\t\t\t\t\tqualities if they are associated with a temperate\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter ; nor, for that matter, does he pursue\n\t\t\t\t\tthose among the youths who are fine-looking and\n\t\t\t\t\thandsome, but those who are teachable and orderly\n\t\t\t\t\tand fond of learning ; nor does the beauty of those\n\t\t\t\t\twhom he sees endowed with freshness, charm, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe flower of youth frighten the philosopher or scare\n\t\t\t\t\thim off and drive him away from those who are\n\t\t\t\t\tworthy of his attention. So, then, if the dignity\n\t\t\t\t\tthat befits leadership and power are associated with\n\t\t\t\t\ta man of moderation and culture, the philosopher\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\twill not hold aloof from making him a friend and\n\t\t\t\t\tcherishing him, nor will he be afraid of being called\n\t\t\t\t\ta courtier and a toady.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tand so are those who take that attitude towards\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship with famous men and leaders. Hence,\n\t\t\t\t\twhile the philosopher who abstains from public\n\t\t\t\t\taffairs will not avoid such men, yet one who is interested in public life will even go to them with\n\t\t\t\t\topen arms ; he will not annoy them against their\n\t\t\t\t\twill, nor will he pitch his camp in their ears with\n\t\t\t\t\tinopportune sophistical disquisitions, but when they\n\t\t\t\t\twish it, he will be glad to converse and spend his\n\t\t\t\t\tleisure with them and eager to associate with them."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "3", "p": {"quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "l": ["The field I sow is twelve days' journey round ;", {"note": {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Niobe"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Trag.

Therefore, just as\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople laugh when the flatterers of Callias are ridiculed in comedy, those flatterers of whom Eupolis\n\t\t\t\t\tsays\n\t\t\t\t\t          \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t          \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tbut the friends and intimates of the tyrant Apollodorus, of Phalaris, and of Dionysius they bastinadoed, tortured, and burned, and made them\n\t\t\t\t\tfor ever polluted and accursed, since the former had\n\t\t\t\t\tdone harm to one man, but the latter through one,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ruler, to many. So the philosophers who associate with persons in private station make those\n\t\t\t\t\tindividuals inoffensive, harmless, and gentle towards\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, but he who removes evil from the character of a ruler, or directs his mind towards what is\n\t\t\t\t\tright, philosophizes, as it were, in the public interest\n\t\t\t\t\tand corrects the general power by which all are\n\t\t\t\t\tgoverned. States pay reverence and honour to their\n\t\t\t\t\tpriests because they ask blessings from the gods, not\n\t\t\t\t\tfor themselves, their friends, and their families alone,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut for all the citizens in common; and yet the\n\t\t\t\t\tpriests do not make the gods givers of blessings, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are such by nature ; the priests merely invoke\n\t\t\t\t\tthem. But philosophers who associate with rulers\n\t\t\t\t\tdo make them more just, more moderate, and more\n\t\t\t\t\teager to do good, so that it is very likely that they\n\t\t\t\t\tare also happier."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "4", "p": {"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "According to the legend, when Amphion played on his lyre, the stones of their own accord formed the walls of Thebes."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Nothing is known of a musician or poet Thales.

WTiat,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, do you imagine the philosopher thinks about\n\t\t\t\t\this teaching, when he reflects that the statesman\n\t\t\t\t\tor ruler who accepts it will be a public blessing\n\t\t\t\t\tby dispensing justice, making laws, punishing the\n\t\t\t\t\twicked, and making the orderly and the good to\n\t\t\t\t\tprosper ?
