For nothing which can be seen or tasted\n\t\t\t\t\tor touched brings on such distractions, confusions,\n\t\t\t\t\tand excitements, as take possession of the soul when\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain crashing, clashing, and roaring noises assail the\n\t\t\t\t\thearing. Yet this sense is more rational than\n\t\t\t\t\temotional. For while many places and parts of the\n\t\t\t\t\tbody make way for vice to enter through them and\n\t\t\t\t\tfasten itself upon the soul, virtue's only hold upon\n\t\t\t\t\tthe young is afforded by the ears, if they be uncontaminated and kept from the outset unspoiled by\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tflattery and untouched by vile words. For this\n\t\t\t\t\treason Xenocrates  advised putting ear-protectors\n\t\t\t\t\ton children rather than on athletes, on the ground\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the latter have only their ears disfigured by the\n\t\t\t\t\tblows they receive, while the former have their\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacters disfigured by the words they hear ; not\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he would thus court heedlessness or deafness,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut he advises vigilance against vile words, until such\n\t\t\t\t\ttime as other words, of good sort, fostered in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter by philosophy, should, like watchmen,\n\t\t\t\t\thave taken under their charge the post chiefly\n\t\t\t\t\texposed to influence and persuasion. And Bias  of\n\t\t\t\t\told, on receiving orders to send to Amasis the portion\n\t\t\t\t\tof the sacrificial animal which was at the same time\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best and the worst, cut out the tongue and sent\n\t\t\t\t\tit to him, on the ground that speech contains both\n\t\t\t\t\tinjuries and benefits in the largest measure. Most\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople in bestowing an affectionate kiss on little\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren not only take hold of the children by the\n\t\t\t\t\tears but bid the children to do the same by them,\n\t\t\t\t\tthus insinuating in a playful way that they must love\n\t\t\t\t\tmost those who confer benefit through the ears.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor surely the fact is plain, that the young man who\n\t\t\t\t\tis debarred from hearing all instruction and gets no\n\t\t\t\t\ttaste of speech not only remains wholly unfruitful\n\t\t\t\t\tand makes no growth towards virtue, but may also\n\t\t\t\t\tbe perverted towards vice, and the product of his\n\t\t\t\t\tmind, like that of a fallow and untilled piece of\n\t\t\t\t\tground, will be a plentiful crop of wild oats.

But here is the most ridiculous thing in the\n\t\t\t\t\tworld : if they chance upon somebody who is giving\n\t\t\t\t\tan account of a dinner or a procession or a dream or\n\t\t\t\t\ta wordy brawl which he has had with another man,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey listen in silence, and importune him to continue ;\n\t\t\t\t\tyet if anybody draws them to one side and tries to\n\t\t\t\t\timpart something useful, or to advise them of some\n\t\t\t\t\tduty, or to admonish them when in the wrong, or to\n\t\t\t\t\tmollify them when incensed, they have no patience\n\t\t\t\t\twith him ; but, eager to get the better of him if they\n\t\t\t\t\tcan, they fight against what he says, or else they beat\n\t\t\t\t\ta hasty retreat in search of other foolish talk, filling\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir ears like worthless and rotten vessels with\n\t\t\t\t\tanything rather than the things they need.

It is an empty pleasure\n\t\t\t\t\tthey give, and an even more empty renown they\n\t\t\t\t\tacquire, so that the remark of Dionysius  fits their\n\t\t\t\t\tcase exactly.

But save us\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the contrary course, followed by the majority,\n\t\t\t\t\twho are delighted with the philosophers and admire\n\t\t\t\t\tthem when they are discoursing about other people ;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut if the philosopher leaves the other people alone,\n\t\t\t\t\tand addresses himself frankly and freely to them,\n\t\t\t\t\tand sets them in mind of matters that much concern\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, they are annoyed and think him officious.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor, as a rule, they imagine that they ought to listen\n\t\t\t\t\tto the philosophers in the schools as they listen to the\n\t\t\t\t\ttragedians in the theatres ; but in matters out of\n\t\t\t\t\tschool they think the philosophers are no better men\n\t\t\t\t\tthan themselves.

An offensive and tiresome listener is the man who is not to be touched or\n\t\t\t\t\tmoved by anything that is said, full of festering\n\t\t\t\t\tpresumption and ingrained self-assertion, as though\n\t\t\t\t\tconvinced that he could say something better than\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is being said, who neither moves his brow nor\n\t\t\t\t\tutters a single word to bear witness that he is glad\n\t\t\t\t\tto listen, but by means of silence and an affected\n\t\t\t\t\tgravity and pose, seeks to gain a reputation for\n\t\t\t\t\tpoise and profundity; as though commendation\n\t\t\t\t\twere money, he feels that he is robbing himself of\n\t\t\t\t\tevery bit that he bestows on another. For there are\n\t\t\t\t\tmany who take that saying of Pythagoras wrongly\n\t\t\t\t\tand out of harmony with his meaning. He declared\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he had gained this advantage from philosophy,\n\t\t\t\t\tto wonder at nothing ; but these men think that\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir advantage gained is to commend nothing, to\n\t\t\t\t\tshow respect for nothing, holding that immunity\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom wonder lies in disdain, and seeking to attain\n\t\t\t\t\tto dignity by means of contempt. Now it is true\n\t\t\t\t\tthat philosophic reasoning, through knowledge and\n\t\t\t\t\tacquaintance with the cause in every case, does away\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\twith the wonder and amazement that spring from\n\t\t\t\t\tblindness and ignorance, but at the same time it\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not destroy our serenity, moderation, or human\n\t\t\t\t\tinterest. For to persons who are truly and consistently good it is the highest credit to bestow credit\n\t\t\t\t\tupon someone deserving of credit, and the most\n\t\t\t\t\tconspicuous honour to honour such a man, since this\n\t\t\t\t\targues a superabundant and generous store of repute;\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas those who are niggardly in their commendation of others give the impression of being pinched\n\t\t\t\t\tand starving for their own.\n\t\t\t\t\tOn the other hand, however, the opposite type\n\t\t\t\t\tof person, light-minded and flighty, who uses no\n\t\t\t\t\tjudgement, but hangs intent on every word and\n\t\t\t\t\tsyllable with an ejaculation ready on his lips, is\n\t\t\t\t\tfrequently no satisfaction to the disputants themselves, and is always a painful affliction for the\n\t\t\t\t\taudience, startling them as he does and exciting\n\t\t\t\t\tthem to join him contrary to their judgement, as\n\t\t\t\t\tthough they for shame could not help being dragged\n\t\t\t\t\tinto the applause. He gets no benefit from the\n\t\t\t\t\tlecture because for him it has been made full of\n\t\t\t\t\tconfusion and fluttering excitement by his continual\n\t\t\t\t\tapplaudings, and he departs with the name of being\n\t\t\t\t\tone of three things : a dissembler, a flatterer, or a\n\t\t\t\t\tboor in all that relates to discourse.\n\t\t\t\t\tNow a man sitting as a judge in court is bound to\n\t\t\t\t\tlisten without regard either to enmity or favour, but\n\t\t\t\t\tin sober judgement with regard to justice ; but at\n\t\t\t\t\tscholarly lectures no law and no oath prohibits us\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom receiving the lecturer with goodwill. Indeed,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ancients gave Hermes a place beside the Graces\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom a feeling that discourse demands, above all,\n\t\t\t\t\tgraciousness and friendliness. For it is not possible\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a speaker to be a failure so abject and complete\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he does not afford something meriting commendation, an original thought, a reminiscence\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom others, the very subject and purpose of his\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscourse, or at least the style and arrangement of\n\t\t\t\t\this remarks, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFor when some have declaimed a panegyric upon\n\t\t\t\t\tvomiting or fever, nay I vow, even upon a kitchenpot, not without a certain amount of plausibility,\n\t\t\t\t\thow could it be that a discourse delivered by a\n\t\t\t\t\tman who in some sort bears the repute and name\n\t\t\t\t\tof philosopher, should not offer, at some point, to\n\t\t\t\t\tbenevolent and humane hearers some respite and\n\t\t\t\t\topportunity for commendation ? We know, at any\n\t\t\t\t\trate, that all persons in the bloom of youth do somehow or other, as Plato   says, act as a stimulus upon\n\t\t\t\t\tthe man inclined to love ; the fair ones he names\n\t\t\t\t\t the dark  while\n\t\t\t\t\tthe hook-nosed he endearingly terms  the\n\t\t\t\t\tsnub-nosed  the sallow \n\t\t\t\t\tand so welcomes and likes them all; for love, like ivy,\n\t\t\t\t\tis clever in attaching itself to any support. Much\n\t\t\t\t\tmore, then, will the scholar and diligent hearer\n\t\t\t\t\talways be ready to discover some cause for which\n\t\t\t\t\the may openly bestow on every speaker some commendation not inappropriate. So Plato, although\n\t\t\t\t\the cannot commend Lysias's speech for invention,\n\t\t\t\t\tand although he condemns its arrangement as disorderly, nevertheless commends the style, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t One\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tmight find fault with Archilochus for his subject\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter, Parmenides for his versification, Phocylides\n\t\t\t\t\tas commonplace, Euripides for his loquacity, and\n\t\t\t\t\tSophocles for his unevenness; and it is equally true of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe orators that one of them has no power to portray\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter, another is slow to rouse emotion, another\n\t\t\t\t\tis lacking in grace ; yet it is a fact that each one of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem is commended for the special faculty with which\n\t\t\t\t\tNature has taught him to move us and draw us on.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt follows, then, that there is ample and abundant\n\t\t\t\t\topportunity for hearers to show friendliness toward\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who are speaking. For some it is quite enough,\n\t\t\t\t\teven if we do not attest this by the voice, that we\n\t\t\t\t\tvouchsafe to them a gentleness of glance, a serenity\n\t\t\t\t\tof countenance, and a disposition kindly and free\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom annoyance.\n\t\t\t\t\tFinally, the following matters, even with speakers\n\t\t\t\t\twho make a complete failure, are, as it were, general\n\t\t\t\t\tand common requirements at every lecture : to sit\n\t\t\t\t\tupright without any lounging or sprawling, to look\n\t\t\t\t\tdirectly at the speaker, to maintain a pose of active\n\t\t\t\t\tattention, and a sedateness of countenance free from\n\t\t\t\t\tany expression, not merely of arrogance or displeasure, but even of other thoughts and preoccupations. Now in every piece of work, beauty is achieved\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough the congruence of numerous factors, so to\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak, brought into union under the rule of a certain\n\t\t\t\t\tdue proportion and harmony, whereas ugliness is\n\t\t\t\t\tready to spring into being if only a single chance\n\t\t\t\t\telement be omitted or added out of place. And so\n\t\t\t\t\tin the particular case of a lecture, not only frowning, a sour face, a roving glance, twisting the body\n\t\t\t\t\tabout, and crossing the legs, are unbecoming, but\n\t\t\t\t\teven nodding, whispering to another, smiling, sleepy\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tyawns, bowing down the head, and all like actions,\n\t\t\t\t\tare culpable and need to be carefully avoided."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "14", "p": "There are others who think that the speaker\n\t\t\t\t\thas a function to perform, and the hearer none.\n\t\t\t\t\tThey think it only right that the speaker shall come\n\t\t\t\t\twith his discourse carefully thought out and prepared,\n\t\t\t\t\twhile they, without consideration or thought of their\n\t\t\t\t\tobligations, rush in and take their seats exactly as\n\t\t\t\t\tthough they had come to dinner, to have a good\n\t\t\t\t\ttime while others toil.

On the other hand, to hear a reprehension or admonition to reform character, delivered\n\t\t\t\t\tin words that penetrate like a biting drug, and not\n\t\t\t\t\tto be humbled at hearing it, not to run into a sweating\n\t\t\t\t\tand dizziness, not to burn with shame in the soul, but,\n\t\t\t\t\ton the contrary to listen unmoved, grinning, dissembling in the face of it all, is a notable sign of an\n\t\t\t\t\tilliberal nature in the young, dead to all modesty\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause of an habitual and continued acquaintance\n\t\t\t\t\twith wrongdoing, with a soul like hard and calloused\n\t\t\t\t\tflesh, upon which no lash can leave a weal.\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch is the behaviour of those who belong to this\n\t\t\t\t\tclass. But young men of the opposite temperament,\n\t\t\t\t\tif they ever hear a single word directed against\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, run away without looking back, and try\n\t\t\t\t\tto desert philosophy ; and, although the sense of\n\t\t\t\t\tmodesty which Nature has bestowed upon them is an\n\t\t\t\t\tadmirable beginning for their salvation, they lose\n\t\t\t\t\tit through effeminacy and weakness, since they\n\t\t\t\t\tdisplay no firmness under reproof, nor do they accept\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrections with the proper spirit, but they turn away\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir ears toward the agreeable and gentle converse\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tof sundry flatterers or voluble talkers, who enchant\n\t\t\t\t\tthem with useless and unprofitable but nevertheless\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant utterances. Just as one who runs away\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the physician after an operation, and will not\n\t\t\t\t\tsubmit to be bandaged, sustains all the pain of the\n\t\t\t\t\ttreatment, but waits not for its benefits : so when\n\t\t\t\t\tthe word has cut and wounded a man's foolishness,\n\t\t\t\t\tif he give it no chance to heal and quiet the wound,\n\t\t\t\t\the comes away from philosophy with a smart and\n\t\t\t\t\tpain but with no benefit. For not only the wound\n\t\t\t\t\tof Telephus, as Euripides  says,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tbut the smart from philosophy which sinks deep in\n\t\t\t\t\tyoung men of good parts is healed by the very words\n\t\t\t\t\twhich inflicted the hurt. For this reason he who is\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken to task must feel and suffer some smart, yet\n\t\t\t\t\the should not be crushed or dispirited, but, as though\n\t\t\t\t\tat a solemn rite of novitiate which consecrates him\n\t\t\t\t\tto philosophy, he should submit to the initial purifications and commotions, in the expectation that\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething delectable and splendid will follow upon\n\t\t\t\t\this present distress and perturbation. Indeed, even\n\t\t\t\t\tif the reproof seems to be given unjustly, it is an\n\t\t\t\t\tadmirable thing to endure it with continued patience\n\t\t\t\t\twhile the man is speaking ; and when he has come\n\t\t\t\t\tto the end, to go to him with an explanation, and beg\n\t\t\t\t\thim to reserve for some real misconduct the frankness\n\t\t\t\t\tand earnestness that he has employed in the present\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "17", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.253"}, {"@id": "v1.p.255"}], "#text": "Moreover, just as in learning to read and\n\t\t\t\t\twrite, or in taking up music or physical training, the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst lessons are attended with much confusion, hard\n\t\t\t\t\twork, and uncertainty, but later, as the learner\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes progress, by slow degrees, just as in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\trelations with human beings, a full familiarity is\n\t\t\t\t\tengendered and knowledge which renders everything attractive, feasible, and easy, both to say and\n\t\t\t\t\tto do, so also is it with philosophy, which undoubtedly\n\t\t\t\t\thas something knotty and unfamiliar in its terms and\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject matter at the outset; yet one ought not to\n\t\t\t\t\ttake fright at its beginnings, and to abandon it in\n\t\t\t\t\ttimorous and craven fashion; rather should he\n\t\t\t\t\texamine each point, and persist and stick to the task\n\t\t\t\t\tof getting on, while awaiting that familiarity which\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes every noble thing a pleasure. For come it\n\t\t\t\t\twill without long delay, bringing with it abundant\n\t\t\t\t\tlight for the subject of study ; it will inspire also a\n\t\t\t\t\tpassionate love for virtue ; and anyone who could\n\t\t\t\t\tendure to pass the rest of his life without this passion,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause he has exiled himself from philosophy for\n\t\t\t\t\twant of true manliness, brands himself either as a\n\t\t\t\t\tvery presumptuous man or else a coward.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is quite possible that the subject of philosophy\n\t\t\t\t\tcontains some matter which is difficult for young\n\t\t\t\t\tand inexperienced students to apprehend at the\n\t\t\t\t\toutset. But, at the same time, they must hold\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves responsible for most of the uncertainty\n\t\t\t\t\tand misunderstanding in which they find themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tinvolved, since quite opposite characters come to fall\n\t\t\t\t\tinto the same error. Some, because of a feeling of\n\t\t\t\t\tshame and a desire to spare the speaker, hesitate to\n\t\t\t\t\task questions and to get the argument firmly fixed\n\t\t\t\t\tin their minds, nodding their heads in assent as\n\t\t\t\t\tthough they comprehended it; others, led by an\n\t\t\t\t\tunseasonable ambition and inane rivalry with their\n\t\t\t\t\tfellow-students, to show off their acuteness and their\n\t\t\t\t\tability to learn easily, avow that they have the\n\t\t\t\t\tmeaning before they have grasped it, and so do not\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tgrasp it at all.

For not only is one\n\t\t\t\t\tbound, as Phocylides says,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tbut he is bound also many a time to be laughed at\n\t\t\t\t\tand to be in disrepute, and to put up with joking and\n\t\t\t\t\tbuffoonery as he struggles with might and main\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst his ignorance and overthrows it.\n\t\t\t\t\tOn the other hand, however, we certainly must\n\t\t\t\t\tnot neglect the mistake that leads to the opposite\n\t\t\t\t\textreme, which some persons are led to commit by\n\t\t\t\t\tlaziness, thus making themselves unpleasant and\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tirksome. For when they are by themselves they\n\t\t\t\t\tare not willing to give themselves any trouble, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthey give trouble to the speaker by repeatedly\n\t\t\t\t\tasking questions about the same things, like unfledged nestlings always agape toward the mouth of\n\t\t\t\t\tanother, and desirous of receiving everything ready\n\t\t\t\t\tprepared and predigested. There is another class,\n\t\t\t\t\twho, eager to be thought astute and attentive out\n\t\t\t\t\tof due place, wear out the speakers with loquacity\n\t\t\t\t\tand officiousness, by continually propounding some\n\t\t\t\t\textraneous and unessential difficulty and asking for\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstrations of matters that need no demonstration, and so, as Sophocles   puts it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tnot only for themselves but for the rest of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcompany too. For holding back the speaker on\n\t\t\t\t\tevery possible occasion by their inane and superfluous\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions, as in a company of persons travelling\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether, they impede the regular course of the\n\t\t\t\t\tlecture, which has to put up with halts and delays.\n\t\t\t\t\tNow such persons are, according to Hieronymus, like\n\t\t\t\t\tcowardly and persistent puppies which, at home,\n\t\t\t\t\tbite at the skins of wild animals, and tear off what\n\t\t\t\t\tbits they can, but never touch the animals themselves. But as for those lazy persons whom we have\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned, let us urge them that, when their\n\t\t\t\t\tintelligence has comprehended the main points, they\n\t\t\t\t\tput the rest together by their own efforts, and use\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir memory as a guide in thinking for themselves,\n\t\t\t\t\tand, taking the discourse of another as a germ and\n\t\t\t\t\tseed, develop and expand it. For the mind does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot require filling like a bottle, but rather, like wood,\n\t\t\t\t\tit only requires kindling to create in it an impulse\n\t\t\t\t\tto think independently and an ardent desire for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\ttruth. Imagine, then, that a man should need to\n\t\t\t\t\tget fire from a neighbour, and, upon finding a big\n\t\t\t\t\tbright fire there, should stay there continually\n\t\t\t\t\twarming himself; just so it is if a man comes to\n\t\t\t\t\tanother to share the benefit of a discourse, and does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot think it necessary to kindle from it some illumination for himself and some thinking of his own, but,\n\t\t\t\t\tdelighting in the discourse, sits enchanted ; he gets,\n\t\t\t\t\tas it were, a bright and ruddy glow in the form of\n\t\t\t\t\topinion imparted to him by what is said, but the\n\t\t\t\t\tmouldiness and darkness of his inner mind he has\n\t\t\t\t\tnot dissipated nor banished by the warm glow of\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy.\n\t\t\t\t\tFinally, if there be need of any other instruction\n\t\t\t\t\tin regard to listening to a lecture, it is that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary to keep in mind what has here been said,\n\t\t\t\t\tand to cultivate independent thinking along with our\n\t\t\t\t\tlearning, so that we may acquire a habit of mind\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is not sophistic or bent on acquiring mere\n\t\t\t\t\tinformation, but one that is deeply ingrained and\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophic, as we may do if we believe that right\n\t\t\t\t\tlistening is the beginning of right living."}}]}}}}
