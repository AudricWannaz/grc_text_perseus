Do not,\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, consider it your business to straighten\n\t\t\t\t\tthem out, and it would not in any case be easy to do\n\t\t\t\t\tso. But if - dealing with them as being what they are\n\t\t\t\t\tby nature, just as a physician uses forceps for teeth\n\t\t\t\t\tand clips for wounds - you show yourself as gentle\n\t\t\t\t\tand self-controlled as you can, you will have greater\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure in your own state of mind than distress at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe unpleasantness and villainy of those others,\n\t\t\t\t\tand you will think that they, like dogs when\n\t\t\t\t\tthey bark, are but fulfilling their nature ; and no\n\t\t\t\t\tlonger will you unwittingly gather into this present\n\t\t\t\t\tcaptiousness or infirmity of yours many grievances,\n\t\t\t\t\tlike offscourings which drain into some hollow and\n\t\t\t\t\tlow-lying ground, thus letting yourself be infected\n\t\t\t\t\twith the vices of others. For since some of the philosophers censure even pity that is expended upon\n\t\t\t\t\tunfortunate persons, on the ground that it is good to\n\t\t\t\t\tgive help to our neighbours, but not to participate in\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir sorrows nor give in to them; and, what is more\n\t\t\t\t\timportant, since these philosophers do not allow us,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen we perceive ourselves to be doing wrong and\n\t\t\t\t\tto be getting into a bad state of mind, to despair or\n\t\t\t\t\tbe dejected, but bid us cure our vice painlessly, as we\n\t\t\t\t\tshould: just consider, then - how can it be anything\n\t\t\t\t\tbut irrational to allow ourselves to become vexed and\n\t\t\t\t\ttroubled because not everyone who has dealings with\n\t\t\t\t\tus or approaches us is honourable and cultivated?\n\t\t\t\t\tNo, my dear Paccius, you must see to it that we\n\t\t\t\t\tare not unwittingly taking a stand in alarm, not at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral wickedness of those we encounter, but at\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir particular wickedness to us ; so our motive\n\t\t\t\t\twould be a selfish interest, not detestation of villainy.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor excessive apprehension about public affairs and\n\t\t\t\t\tunworthy appetites and desires, or, on the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand, aversions and dislikes, engender suspicions and\n\t\t\t\t\tenmities toward persons who were, we think, the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of our being deprived of some desirable things\n\t\t\t\t\tand of our encountering others which are unpleasant;\n\t\t\t\t\tit is the man who has become accustomed to adapt\n\t\t\t\t\thimself to public affairs easily and with self-control\n\t\t\t\t\twho becomes the most gracious and gentle in his\n\t\t\t\t\tdealings with his fellows."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "8", "p": {"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "supra"}, "#text": "That is, the argument presented in chap. 4, ."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf.

For not only does  as Epicurus\n\t\t\t\t\tsays, \n\t\t\t\t\tbut also wealth and reputation and power and public\n\t\t\t\t\toffice delight most of all those who least fear their\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\topposites. For the violent desire for each of these\n\t\t\t\t\timplants a most violent fear that they may not\n\t\t\t\t\tremain, and so renders pleasure in them weak and\n\t\t\t\t\tunstable, like a fluttering flame. But the man whom\n\t\t\t\t\tReason enables to say to Fortune without fear and\n\t\t\t\t\ttrembling,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\this confidence and the absence of fear that their loss\n\t\t\t\t\twould be unbearable cause him to make most pleasant\n\t\t\t\t\tuse of present advantages. For it is possible not only\n\t\t\t\t\tto admire the disposition of Anaxagoras, which made\n\t\t\t\t\thim say at the death of his son,  but also to imitate it and to apply\n\t\t\t\t\tit to every dispensation of Fortune :  \n                \n                For men of such\n\t\t\t\t\tpreparedness and of such disposition, if anything\n\t\t\t\t\tunwished yet not unexpected happens, disdain sentiments like these : \n\t\t\t\t\tor  or  and so do away with anything like throbbings and palpitations of the heart, and speedily restore\n\t\t\t\t\tagain to quiet the madness and disturbance of their\n\t\t\t\t\tminds. Carneades, indeed, reminded us that in\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters of great importance it is the unexpected\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is completely and wholly the cause of grief and\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tdejection. For example, the kingdom of Macedonia\n\t\t\t\t\twas infinitely smaller than the Roman dominion, yet\n\t\t\t\t\twhen Perseus lost Macedonia, both he himself bewailed his own evil genius and every one thought that\n\t\t\t\t\the had become the most unfortunate and ill-starred\n\t\t\t\t\tman in the world; but Aemilius, his conqueror,\n\t\t\t\t\thanded over to another his supreme command of\n\t\t\t\t\tpractically the whole earth and sea, yet was crowned\n\t\t\t\t\tand offered sacrifice and was esteemed fortunate -\n\t\t\t\t\tand with good reason, for he knew that he had taken\n\t\t\t\t\ta command which would have to be relinquished\n\t\t\t\t\tagain, whereas Perseus lost his kingdom when he had\n\t\t\t\t\tnot expected to do so. And well has the Poet taught\n\t\t\t\t\tus how strong the effect of an unexpected happening\n\t\t\t\t\tis : Odysseus, for instance, shed a tear when his\n\t\t\t\t\tdog fawned upon him, yet when he sat beside his\n\t\t\t\t\tweeping wife, gave way to no such emotion ; for into\n\t\t\t\t\tthe latter situation he had come with his emotion\n\t\t\t\t\tunder control and fortified by reason, but he had\n\t\t\t\t\tstumbled into the former without having expected it,\n\t\t\t\t\tand suddenly."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "17", "p": [{"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Com.
