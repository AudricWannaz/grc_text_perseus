The suspicion rests mainly on two grounds, the unusual\n\t\t\t\t\tlength of the quotations, and certain incongruities of style. The latter may\n\t\t\t\t\there be briefly dismissed with the remark that for every departure from\n\t\t\t\t\taccepted Plutarchean style a striking instance of conformity to his style\n\t\t\t\t\tmay be cited, so that no very positive results are to be obtained in this\n\t\t\t\t\tway. The case is much the same with the quotations. Many of them are\n\t\t\t\t\tunusually long, although not longer than we find in other authors. Some of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, for example Euripides, Suppliants 1110 and 1112 (Plut. 110c), show an\n\t\t\t\t\taccuracy of ms. tradition so far superior that the reading given by Plutarch\n\t\t\t\t\tis commonly adopted by editors of Euripides in preference to the traditional\n\t\t\t\t\treading of the mss. of Euripides. On the other hand, the quotation from\n\t\t\t\t\tPlato, Gorgias 523 a (Plut. 120 e), shows many minor variations from our\n\t\t\t\t\ttext of Plato ; some of these are interesting in themselves, but none of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem really disturbs the meaning of the passage.", {"pb": {"@id": "v.2.p.106"}, "#text": "We learn from the letter almost nothing about  Apollonius\n\t\t\t\t\tand his departed son, and hardly more about Plutarch.

It is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfact that wars and strifes and battles are brought about by nothing else\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcept the body and its desires ; for all wars are waged for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacquisition of property, and property we are forced to acquire because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the body, since we are slaves in its service ; and the result is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, because of these things, we have no leisure for study. And the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworst of all is, that even if we do gain some leisure from the demands\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the body, and turn to the consideration of some subject, yet at every\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoint in our investigation the body forces itself in, and causes tumult\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand confusion, and disconcerts us, so that on account of it we are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunable to discern the truth. Nay, the fact has been thoroughly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemonstrated to us that, if we are ever going to have any pure\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknowledge, we must divest ourselves of the body, and with the soul\n\t\t\t\t\t\titself observe the realities.

For if it is impossible in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompany with the body to have any pure knowledge, then one of two things\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis true : either it is not possible to attain knowledge anywhere, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\telse only after death. For then the soul will be quite by itself,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseparate from the body, but before that time never. And so, while we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlive, we shall, as it appears, be nearest to knowledge if, as far as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossible, we have no association or communion with the body, except such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas absolute necessity requires, and if we do not taint ourselves with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits nature, but keep ourselves pure of it until such time as God himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshall release us. And thus, being rid of the irrationality of the body,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe shall, in all likelihood, be in the company of others in like state,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand we shall behold with our own eyes the pure and absolute, which is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe truth ; since for the impure to touch the pure may well be against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe divine ordinance."}], "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Phaedo"}, "#text": ", p. 66 B."}, "#text": "If death indeed resembles a journey, even so  it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tan evil.

As Homer \n\t\t\t\t\t\ttells the tale, Zeus, Poseidon, and Pluto divided the kingdom when they\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceived it from their father. Now this was the custom regarding men\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven in the time of Cronus, and it has persisted among the gods to this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdaythat the man who has passed through life justly and in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tholiness shall, at his death, depart to the Islands of the Blest and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdwell in all happiness beyond the reach of evil, while he who has lived\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan unjust and godless life shall go to the prison-house of justice and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpunishment, which they call Tartarus. The judges of these men, in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime of Cronus and in the early days of Zeus's dominion, were living,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand judged the living, giving judgement on the day when the men were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout to die. As time went on, for some reason the cases were not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecided well. Accordingly Pluto and the supervisors in the Islands of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Blest went to Zeus and said to him that there kept coming to them at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth places inadmissible persons. ' Very well,' said Zeus, ' then I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshall put a stop to this proceeding. The judgements are now rendered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoorly ; for,' said he, ' those who are judged are judged with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcovering on them, since they are judged while alive, and so,' he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinued, a good \n\t\t\t\t\t\t many perhaps who have base souls are clad with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeautiful bodies and ancestry and riches, and, when the judgement takes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace, many come to testify for them that they have lived righteously.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo not only are the judges disconcerted by these things, but at the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime they themselves sit in judgement with a covering on them, having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore their own souls, like a veil, their eyes and ears and their whole\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody. All these things come between, both their own covering and that of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who are being judged. In the first place, then, all their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforeknowledge of death must be ended ; for now they have foreknowledge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof it. So Prometheus has been told to put an end to this. Secondly, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmust be judged divested of all these things ; for they must be judged\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter they have died. The judge also must be naked, and dead, that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmay view with his very soul the very soul of every man instantly after\n\t\t\t\t\t\the has died, and isolated from all his kin, having left behind on earth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall earthly adornments, so that his judgement may be just. I, therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\t\trealizing this situation sooner than you, have made my own sons judges,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo from AsiaMinos and Rhadamanthys\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand one from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEurope\u201a\u00c4\u00eeAeacus.

The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople of Asia shall Rhadamanthys judge, while Aeacus shall judge the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople of Europe; and to Minos I shall give the prerogative of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpronouncing final judgement in case the other \n\t\t\t\t\t\t two be in any doubt, in order that the decision in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregard to the route which men must take shall be as just as possible.'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis, Callicles, is what I have heard, and believe to be true ; and from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese words I draw the following inference\u201a\u00c4\u00eethat death is, as it seems\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto me, nothing else than the severing of two things, soul and body, from\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach other."}, "#text": "The divine Plato has said a good deal in his treatise On the Soul about its\n\t\t\t\t\timmortality, and not a little also in the Republic and Meno and Gorgias, and\n\t\t\t\t\there and there in his other dialogues. What is said in the dialogue On the\n\t\t\t\t\tSoul I will copy, with comments, and send you separately, as you desired.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut for the present occasion these words, which were spoken \n\t\t\t\t\t to Callicles the Athenian, the friend and disciple of\n\t\t\t\t\tGorgias the orator, are timely and profitable. They say that Socrates,\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to Plato's account, says :"}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "37", "p": "Having collected and put together these extracts, my dearest Apollonius, with\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat diligence, I have completed this letter of condolence to you, which is\n\t\t\t\t\tmost needful to enable you to put aside your present grief and to put an end\n\t\t\t\t\tto mourning, which is the most distressing of all things. In it is included\n\t\t\t\t\talso for your son, Apollonius, a youth so very dear to the gods, a fitting\n\t\t\t\t\ttribute, which is much coveted by the sanctifieda tribute due to\n\t\t\t\t\this honourable memory and to his fair fame, which will endure for time\n\t\t\t\t\teternal. You will do well, therefore, to be persuaded by reason, and, as a\n\t\t\t\t\tfavour to your dear departed son, to turn from your unprofitable distress\n\t\t\t\t\tand desolation, which affect both body and soul, and to go back to your\n\t\t\t\t\taccustomed and natural course of life. Forasmuch as your son, while he was\n\t\t\t\t\tliving among us, was sorry to see either you or his mother downcast, even\n\t\t\t\t\tso, now that he is with the gods and is feasting with them, he would not be\n\t\t\t\t\twell satisfied with your present course of life. Resume, therefore, the\n\t\t\t\t\tspirit of a brave-hearted and high-minded man who loves his offspring, and\n\t\t\t\t\tset free from all this wretchedness both yourself, the mother of the youth,\n\t\t\t\t\tand your relatives and friends, as you may do by pursuing a more tranquil\n\t\t\t\t\tform of life, which will be most gratifying both to your son and to all of\n\t\t\t\t\tus who are concerned for you, as we rightly should be."}]}}}}
