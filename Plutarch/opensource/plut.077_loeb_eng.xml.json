But when a man has satisfied the moderate demands of his\n\t\t\t\t\tnature, and has had his fill, he ought to exercise the very greatest\n\t\t\t\t\tvigilance against helping himself to such things.

Quite similar is\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir behaviour toward notorious women.

Least of all ought the body to be stirred to pleasures by the\n\t\t\t\t\tmind's desire, since such an origin is unnatural. Just as tickling the\n\t\t\t\t\tarm-pits so affects the mind as to produce laughter which is not natural, or\n\t\t\t\t\teven mild or happy, but convulsive and harsh, so whatsoever pleasures the\n\t\t\t\t\tbody achieves through being prodded and disturbed by the mind are deranging\n\t\t\t\t\tand disturbing and foreign to Nature. Whenever, then, someone of those rare\n\t\t\t\t\tand notorious means of enjoyment is afforded us, we ought to take more pride\n\t\t\t\t\tin abstinence than in enjoyment, remembering that just as Simonides  used\n\t\t\t\t\tto say that he had never been sorry for having kept silent, but many a time\n\t\t\t\t\tfor having spoken, so we have never been sorry either for having put a\n\t\t\t\t\tdainty to one side, or for having drunk water instead of Falernian wine, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe opposite ; not only ought Nature not to be forced, but if anything of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis sort is offered her even when she has need of it, the appetite ought to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe often diverted from it towards the plain and familiar food for the sake\n\t\t\t\t\tof habituation and training.  are the words of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Theban, who is not correct in saying, far best it were  \n\t\t\t\t\t           But we can improve on this by saying that if we must\n\t\t\t\t\tneeds seek repute in such matters as food and drink,  by continence for the sake of health. Nevertheless\n\t\t\t\t\tstinginess and greediness constrain some persons, who repress and reduce\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir desires in their own homes, to stuff themselves and enjoy themselves\n\t\t\t\t\twith expensive things at others' houses as though they were engaged in\n\t\t\t\t\truthless foraging in an enemy's country ; then they go away much indisposed,\n\t\t\t\t\tand for the next day they have an attack of indigestion to pay for their\n\t\t\t\t\tinsatiable appetite. So Crates, thinking that luxury and extravagance were\n\t\t\t\t\tas much to blame as anything for the growth of civil discords and the rule\n\t\t\t\t\tof despots in states, humorously advised :  And let everybody exhort\n\t\t\t\t\thimself \n\t\t\t\t\tand by all means not to proceed beyond cress and olives to croquettes and\n\t\t\t\t\tfish, and by overeating throw  that is\n\t\t\t\t\tto say, into derangements and diarrhoeas. For the inexpensive things keep\n\t\t\t\t\tthe appetite to its natural limits of moderation, but the arts of the chefs\n\t\t\t\t\tand their trained helpers, and, in the words of the comic poet, \n                are constantly advancing and\n\t\t\t\t\tenlarging the bounds of enjoyment, and altering our ideas of what is good\n\t\t\t\t\tfor us. I do not know how it is that, while we loathe and detest women who\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrive philters and magic to use upon their husbands, we entrust  our food and provisions to hirelings and slaves to be\n\t\t\t\t\tall but bewitched and drugged. If the saying of Arcesilaus  addressed to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe adulterous and licentious appears too bitter, to the effect that ' it\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes no difference whether a man practises lewdness in the front parlour or\n\t\t\t\t\tin the back hall,' yet it is not without its application to our subject. For\n\t\t\t\t\tin very truth, what difference does it make whether a man employ\n\t\t\t\t\taphrodisiacs to stir and excite licentiousness for the purposes of pleasure,\n\t\t\t\t\tor whether he stimulate his taste by odours and sauces to require, like the\n\t\t\t\t\titch, continual scratchings and ticklings ?"}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "8", "p": {"note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Trag.

Nevertheless, some men, although their body itself\n\t\t\t\t\tall but resists and would fain drag them to their beds and their rest, are\n\t\t\t\t\tled by gluttony and self-indulgence to rush off to the baths and eagerly to\n\t\t\t\t\tjoin in the drinking-bouts, as if they were laying in provisions for a siege\n\t\t\t\t\tand were fearful lest the fever seize them before they have had luncheon.\n\t\t\t\t\tOthers, less gross than these, are not indeed caught in this folly, but very\n\t\t\t\t\tstupidly, just because they are ashamed to admit having a headache or\n\t\t\t\t\tindigestion, and to keep their clothes on all day, when a crowd on their way\n\t\t\t\t\tto the gymnasium invite them to come along, they get up and go, strip with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe others, and go through the same exercises as do those who are in sound\n\t\t\t\t\thealth. But as for the majority, Hope, backed by a proverb which well\n\t\t\t\t\taccords with incontinence and weakness of purpose, persuades and induces\n\t\t\t\t\tthem to get up and go recklessly to their accustomed haunts, thinking to\n\t\t\t\t\texpel and dispel wine with wine, and headache with headache.

For if there \n\t\t\t\t\t is anything the matter with us, failure to take proper\n\t\t\t\t\tprecaution and to put a check on ourselves will do us harm ; and if nothing\n\t\t\t\t\tis the matter, it will do no harm for the body to be subjected to some\n\t\t\t\t\trestrictions and cleared of some of its encumbrances.

Water, not only the water that is mixed with \n\t\t\t\t\t           the wine, but that which is drunk by itself in the\n\t\t\t\t\tinterim between the draughts of the mixture, makes the mixture more\n\t\t\t\t\tinnocent. One ought to accustom oneself, therefore, in the course of the\n\t\t\t\t\tdaily routine to partake of two or three glasses of water, thus both making\n\t\t\t\t\tthe potency of the wine milder, and making the drinking of water habitual\n\t\t\t\t\twith the body, so that, whenever it comes to be in need of water, it may not\n\t\t\t\t\tfeel strange towards the drink, and refuse it. For the fact is that some\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople feel most impelled towards wine when the drink which they most need\n\t\t\t\t\tis water. For after being exposed to the sun, and again when chilled, and\n\t\t\t\t\tafter speaking more earnestly and thinking more intently than usual, and, in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral, after exertions and strivings, they think they ought to drink wine,\n\t\t\t\t\tfeeling that Nature requires for the body some comfort and change after\n\t\t\t\t\tlabours. But Nature does not require comfort, if comfort is only a name for\n\t\t\t\t\tself-indulgence, but she does require a change, a change which puts the body\n\t\t\t\t\tin a state midway between pleasure and pain. Therefore in such circumstances\n\t\t\t\t\tthere should not only be some reduction in food, but wine should be either\n\t\t\t\t\taltogether eliminated or else partaken of between times very diluted and\n\t\t\t\t\tpractically engulfed by the drinking of water. For wine, being truculent and\n\t\t\t\t\tkeen, intensifies the disturbances of the body, and exacerbates and\n\t\t\t\t\tirritates the contused parts, which are in need of the comfort and\n\t\t\t\t\talleviation that water best supplies. For if, in spite of the fact that we\n\t\t\t\t\tare not thirsty, we drink hot water after undergoing exertion, strain, or\n\t\t\t\t\theat, we are sensible of a relaxing and soothing effect within us; for the\n\t\t\t\t\taqueous fluid is mild and does not quicken the pulse, \n\t\t\t\t\twhereas that of wine has great impetuosity and a potency that is not kindly\n\t\t\t\t\tor humanely disposed toward recent affections. As for the acerbities and\n\t\t\t\t\tbitterness which some say fasting engenders in the body , if anybody fears\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, or if, childlike, he thinks it a dreadful thing not to have a meal\n\t\t\t\t\tserved before the fever which he suspects is coming, the drinking of water\n\t\t\t\t\tis a very fitting middle course. In fact we frequently make to Dionysus\n\t\t\t\t\thimself offerings which include no wine, thus habituating ourselves quite\n\t\t\t\t\tproperly not to be always looking for strong drink. Minos, too, because of\n\t\t\t\t\tgrief, abolished the flute and garland from the sacrifice. Yet we know that\n\t\t\t\t\ta grieving soul is not affected either by garlands or by flute.

For the man has no perception regarding himself, and is but a blind\n\t\t\t\t\tand deaf tenant in his own body, who gets his knowledge of these matters\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom another, and must inquire of his physician whether his health is better\n\t\t\t\t\tin summer or winter, whether he can more easily tolerate liquid or solid\n\t\t\t\t\tfoods, and whether his pulse is naturally fast or slow.
