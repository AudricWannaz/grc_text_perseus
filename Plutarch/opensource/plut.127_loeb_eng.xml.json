He affirms, in fact, that anything which\n\t\t\t\t\tundergoes contraction and condensation of matter\n\t\t\t\t\tis cold, while anything that suffers rarefaction and\n\t\t\t\t\tdistention - this comes close to his own phrasing - is\n\t\t\t\t\thot. So there is no contradiction in the remark that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe man blew both hot and cold, for breath grows\n\t\t\t\t\tcold when it is compressed and condensed by the lips ;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut when it is expelled from the mouth left slack, it\n\t\t\t\t\tbecomes hot through rarefaction. Aristotle, however, holds that in this Anaximenes was mistaken :\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the mouth is slack, what is exhaled is warm air\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom our own bodies ; but when we compress the\n\t\t\t\t\tlips and blow, it is not air from ourselves, but the cold\n\t\t\t\t\tair in front of the mouth that is propelled forward and\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes contact."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "8", "p": {"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Timaeus"}], "#text": "Plato, , 53 c, 54 b-c."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "with Hestia,"}, "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Phaedrus"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Euthyphro"}], "#text": "Or, perhaps,  as the first principle of the cosmos (see, for example, Ritter, on Plato, , 247 a, pp. 123-124 of his edition).

A proof of this is its lightness, by reason of which\n\t\t\t\t\tit maintains itself on the surface of all other things,\n\t\t\t\t\tbuoyed up by the air. If it is sprinkled upon the\n\t\t\t\t\twaves, it will calm the sea, not because it is so smooth\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the winds slip off it, as Aristotle affirmed ; but\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the waves are dissipated when they are\n\t\t\t\t\tstruck by any moist substance. But it is peculiar to\n\t\t\t\t\toil that it provides light and sight at the bottom since\n\t\t\t\t\tthe moist elements are interspersed with air ; it is,\n\t\t\t\t\tin fact, not only on the surface that it provides light\n\t\t\t\t\tfor those who pass the night at sea ; it does so also\n\t\t\t\t\tfor sponge-divers below the surface when it is blown\n\t\t\t\t\tout of their mouths. Air, therefore, has no greater\n\t\t\t\t\tproportion of darkness than water has, and it has\n\t\t\t\t\tless cold. Certainly oil, which has more air than any\n\t\t\t\t\tother moist substance, is least cold; and when it\n\t\t\t\t\tfreezes, it forms a soft jelly : the air that is intermixed\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not permit it to freeze hard. They dip needles,\n\t\t\t\t\tiron clasps, and all delicate artifacts in oil rather than\n\t\t\t\t\tin water, fearing that the water's excessive frigidity\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tmay distort them. It is, in fact, fairer to judge the\n\t\t\t\t\targument by this evidence than by that of colour,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince snow and hail and ice are at their brightest when\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are coldest.

And what is this ?\n\t\t\t\t\tWhy, that it is primordially dark and cold. For if he\n\t\t\t\t\ttakes these two pairs of opposing forces and assumes\n\t\t\t\t\tthat one must of necessity accompany the other,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are, surely, innumerable oppositions and antipathies between the aether and the earth with which\n\t\t\t\t\tone might suppose this to be consistent.

Why, it is the darkest\n\t\t\t\t\tand most unilluminated of all things. Certainly air\n\t\t\t\t\tis first of all to participate in light; it is instantly\n\t\t\t\t\taltered and when it is saturated, it distributes\n\t\t\t\t\tillumination everywhere, lending itself to light as a\n\t\t\t\t\tbody in which to reside. For when the sun arises,\n\t\t\t\t\tas one of the dithyrambic writers has said,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t          \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNext the air, moving downward, infuses a part of its\n\t\t\t\t\tbrightness into the lakes and the sea, and the depths\n\t\t\t\t\tof the rivers flash brightly, to the extent that air\n\t\t\t\t\tis able to penetrate them. Of all bodies only the\n\t\t\t\t\tearth remains constantly without light, impenetrable\n\t\t\t\t\tto the illumination of sun or moon ; yet it is warmed\n\t\t\t\t\tby them and permits the heat to sink in and warm\n\t\t\t\t\tit up to a slight depth. But because it is solid, earth\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not give passage to light, but is encircled by\n\t\t\t\t\tlight on its surface only, while the inner parts are\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled Darkness and Chaos and Hades - so that\n\t\t\t\t\tErebus turns out to be the subterranean and interior\n\t\t\t\t\tdarkness. Then, too, the poets tell us that Night\n\t\t\t\t\twas born of Earth and mathematicians demonstrate\n\t\t\t\t\tthat night is the shadow of Earth blocking the light\n\t\t\t\t\tof the sun. The air, indeed, is saturated with darkness by the earth, just as it is with light by the sun.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe unlighted portion of the air is the area of night,\n\t\t\t\t\tamounting to the space occupied by the earth's\n\t\t\t\t\tshadow. This is the reason why men make use of the\n\t\t\t\t\tair out of doors even when it is night, as well as many\n\t\t\t\t\tbeasts which do their pasturing in the darkness, since\n\t\t\t\t\tit retains some vestiges of light and dispersed glimmerings of radiance ; but the house-bound man who\n\t\t\t\t\tis under a roof is utterly blind and without light\n\t\t\t\t\tinasmuch as there the earth envelops him from all\n\t\t\t\t\tdirections. Whole skins, furthermore, and horns of\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals do not let light pass through them because\n\t\t\t\t\tof their solidity ; yet if sections are sawed off and\n\t\t\t\t\tpolished, they become translucent when once the\n\t\t\t\t\tair has been mixed with them. It is also my opinion\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the earth is called black by the poets, whenever\n\t\t\t\t\tthey have occasion to do so, because of its murky and\n\t\t\t\t\tlightless characteristics. The result, then, of these\n\t\t\t\t\tconsiderations is that the much-prized antithesis of\n\t\t\t\t\tlight and darkness belongs to earth rather than to air."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "18", "p": {"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Frag. 184 Wimmer."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "The Greeks and their Gods"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Bacchae"}], "#text": "The Thyiades were Attic women, devotees of Dionysus, who went every other year to Delphi to join in the midwinter festival.

What is\n\t\t\t\t\tmastered by heat is reduced to flames, what is\n\t\t\t\t\tmastered by wind turns to air ; and anything that\n\t\t\t\t\tfalls into the water, unless it gets out quickly, dissolves and liquefies. It follows, then, that whatever\n\t\t\t\t\tis completely frozen must turn into primordial cold.\n\t\t\t\t\tNow freezing is extreme refrigeration that terminates\n\t\t\t\t\tin a complete alteration and petrifaction when, since\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cold has obtained complete mastery, the moist\n\t\t\t\t\telements are frozen solid and the heat is squeezed\n\t\t\t\t\tout. This is the reason why the earth at its bottommost point is practically all solid frost and ice. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthere undiluted and unmitigated cold abides at bay,\n\t\t\t\t\tthrust back to the point farthest removed from the\n\t\t\t\t\tflaming aether.

For the cold freezes\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances to a varying degree, but hardest those of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it is naturally a primary constituent. Thus, if\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tit is the nature of heat to lighten, the lightest object\n\t\t\t\t\twill have most heat, and if it is the nature of humidity\n\t\t\t\t\tto soften, the softest will have the most humidity ;\n\t\t\t\t\tso, if it is also true that the nature of cold is to harden,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen it must also follow that the hardest object will\n\t\t\t\t\thave the most cold - that is to say, just as the earth\n\t\t\t\t\thas. But what is coldest by nature is surely also\n\t\t\t\t\tprimarily cold, so that the earth is in fact cold both\n\t\t\t\t\tprimordially and naturally ; and, of course, this is\n\t\t\t\t\tobvious even to the senses.
