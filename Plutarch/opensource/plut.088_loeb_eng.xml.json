And first he\n\t\t\t\t\tattacked with an army of seventy thousand, pillaged\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Spartans' territory, and persuaded the Perioeci\n\t\t\t\t\tto revolt from them.

This\n\t\t\t\t\tis the rebel-rout of the god of war, with battalions\n\t\t\t\t\ton land and squadrons on sea, laden with mingled\n\t\t\t\t\tspoils and trophies :\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tas Epameinondas the Theban cried, when he and his\n\t\t\t\t\tmen were dedicating themselves to the noblest and\n\t\t\t\t\tmost resplendent of struggles for their native land,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe graves of their fathers, and their holy shrines.

Their ornaments and emblems are buildings like the Parthenon\n\t\t\t\t\tone hundred feet in length, southern Long Walls, \n\t\t\t\t\tdockyards, Propylaea, Chersonese, and Amphipolis.\n\t\t\t\t\tMarathon leads forward the Victory of Miltiades, and\n\t\t\t\t\tSalamis does the same for Themistocles' Victory,\n\t\t\t\t\tpoised upon the wreckage of a thousand ships.\n\t\t\t\t\tCimon's Victory brings an hundred Phoenician ships\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the Eurymedon, and the Victory of Demosthenes and Cleon brings from Sphacteria the captive\n\t\t\t\t\tshield of Brasidas and his soldiers in chains. Conon's\n\t\t\t\t\tVictory fortifies the city with new walls, while that of\n\t\t\t\t\tThrasybulus leads back from Phyle the people restored to freedom. Alcibiades' Victories revive the\n\t\t\t\t\tcity laid prostrate by her failure in Sicily. From the\n\t\t\t\t\tstruggles of Neileus and Androclus about Lydia and\n\t\t\t\t\tCaria Greece came to see that Ionia was rising. If\n\t\t\t\t\tyou inquire of the other Victories in turn what good\n\t\t\t\t\tcame to the State from each, one will reply Lesbos,\n\t\t\t\t\tanother Samos, another Cyprus, another the Euxine,\n\t\t\t\t\tanother five hundred triremes, another ten thousand\n\t\t\t\t\ttalents, to say nothing of the glory and the trophies\n\t\t\t\t\twhich they won. These are the things which the city\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tcelebrates in her festivals, for these she sacrifices to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe gods, not for the dramatic victories of Aeschylus\n\t\t\t\t\tand Sophocles. Nor is the day celebrated when\n\t\t\t\t\tCarcinus was successful with his , or Astydamas with his , but even yet the State celebrates the victory at Marathon on the sixth of\n\t\t\t\t\tBodromion. On the sixteenth of this month they\n\t\t\t\t\tpour a libation of wine in memory of Chabrias's\n\t\t\t\t\tvictory at Naxos. On the twelfth they used to\n\t\t\t\t\tsacrifice thank-offerings for the recovery of their\n\t\t\t\t\tliberty, for on that day the exiles returned from\n\t\t\t\t\tPhyl. On the third they won the battle of\n\t\t\t\t\tPlataeae. The sixteenth of Munichion they dedicated to Artemis, for on that day the goddess shone\n\t\t\t\t\twith full moon upon the Greeks as they were conquering at Salamis. The conflict at Mantineia has\n\t\t\t\t\tmade the twelfth of Scirophorion more sacred; for in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis battle, when the other allies were overpowered\n\t\t\t\t\tand routed, it was the Athenians alone who defeated\n\t\t\t\t\tthe force opposed to them and erected a trophy taken\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the victorious enemy. These are the things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich have uplifted Athens to heights of glory and\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatness; it was for these that Pindar addressed\n\t\t\t\t\tAthens as\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tnot because she had guided the Greeks aright with\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthe tragedies of Phrynichus and Thespis, but because,\n\t\t\t\t\tas he himself says, first at Artemisium\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd when at Salamis and Mycal and Plataeae they\n\t\t\t\t\thad firmly established, as in adamant, the liberty of\n\t\t\t\t\tGreece, they handed it down to all mankind."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "8", "p": [{"note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Against Ctesiphon"}, "#text": "Aeschines, , 146."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Against Eratosthenes"}, "#text": "The speech ."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf.

But Isocrates, although he had declared\n\t\t\t\t\tthat those who had risked their lives at Marathon had\n\t\t\t\t\tfought as though their souls were not their own, and\n\t\t\t\t\talthough he had hymned their daring and their contempt of life, himself (so they say), when he was\n\t\t\t\t\talready an old man, replied to someone who asked\n\t\t\t\t\thim how he was getting on,  For he had not grown old sharpening his\n\t\t\t\t\tsword nor whetting his spear-point nor polishing\n\t\t\t\t\this helmet nor campaigning nor pulling at the oar,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut in glueing together and arranging antitheses,\n\t\t\t\t\tbalanced clauses, and inflexional similarities, all but\n\t\t\t\t\tsmoothing off and proportioning his periods with\n\t\t\t\t\tchisel and file. How could this person do other than\n\t\t\t\t\tfear the clash of arms and the impact of phalanxes,\n\t\t\t\t\the who feared to let vowel collide with vowel, or to\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tutter a phrase whose balance was upset by the lack\n\t\t\t\t\tof a single syllable? For Miltiades set forth for\n\t\t\t\t\tMarathon, joined battle the next day, and returned\n\t\t\t\t\tvictorious with his army to the city ; and Pericles,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen he had subdued the Samians in nine months,\n\t\t\t\t\twas prouder of his achievement than was Agamemnon, who captured Troy in the tenth year. But\n\t\t\t\t\tIsocrates consumed almost twelve years in writing\n\t\t\t\t\this \n               ; and during this period he took part\n\t\t\t\t\tin no campaigns, nor served on any embassy, nor\n\t\t\t\t\tfounded any city, nor was dispatched as commander\n\t\t\t\t\tof a fleet, although this era brought forth countless\n\t\t\t\t\twars. But while Timothes was freeing Euboea, and\n\t\t\t\t\tChabrias with his fleet was fighting at Naxos, and\n\t\t\t\t\tIphicrates near Lechaeum was cutting to pieces the\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartan division, and the Athenian people, having\n\t\t\t\t\tliberated every city, bestowed upon Greece equal\n\t\t\t\t\tsuffrage with themselves, Isocrates sat at home\n\t\t\t\t\tremodelling a book with mere words, as long a\n\t\t\t\t\ttime as sufficed for Pericles to erect the Propylaea\n\t\t\t\t\tand his temples a hundred feet long. Yet Cratinus\n\t\t\t\t\tpokes fun even at Pericles for his slowness in accomplishing his undertakings, and remarks somewhat as\n\t\t\t\t\tfollows about his Middle Wall:\n\t\t\t\t\t          \n\t\t\t\t\tBut consider the petty spirit of this sophist, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tcaused the ninth part of his life to be spent on the\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposition of one speech. Is it, then, greatly\n\t\t\t\t\tworth our while to compare the speeches of the\n\t\t\t\t\torator Demosthenes with the deeds of Demosthenes\n\t\t\t\t\tthe general? To compare the speech \n               \n\t\t\t\t\tfor assault and battery with Demosthenes' trophies\n\t\t\t\t\twon at Pylos? To compare the speech directed at\n\t\t\t\t\tArethusius on the slaves with Demosthenes' reduction of the Spartans to slavery? The orator's age\n\t\t\t\t\twhen he wrote his speeches against his guardians\n\t\t\t\t\twas the same as that of Alcibiades when he united\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Mantineans and Eleans against Sparta. And\n\t\t\t\t\tindeed Demosthenes' public orations have this\n\t\t\t\t\twonderful characteristic : in the  he spurs\n\t\t\t\t\this countrymen on to action and he praises the action\n\t\t\t\t\tof Leptines."}]}], "pb": {"@id": "v.4.p.493"}}}}}
