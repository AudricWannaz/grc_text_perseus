This fact affords to the flatterer a very wide field within the\n\t\t\t\t\trealm of friendship, since in our love of self he has an excellent base of\n\t\t\t\t\toperations against us. It is because of this self-love that everybody is\n\t\t\t\t\thimself his own foremost and greatest flatterer, and hence finds no\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty in admitting the outsider to witness with him and to confirm his\n\t\t\t\t\town conceits and desires. For the man who is spoken of with opprobrium as a\n\t\t\t\t\tlover of flatterers is in high degree a lover of self, and, because of his\n\t\t\t\t\tkindly feeling toward himself, he desires and conceives himself to be\n\t\t\t\t\tendowed with all manner of good qualities ; but although the desire for\n\t\t\t\t\tthese is not unnatural, yet the conceit that one possesses them is dangerous\n\t\t\t\t\tand must be carefully avoided.

Moreover, just as Simonides  says,  so we observe that flattery\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not attend upon poor, obscure, or unimportant persons, but makes itself\n\t\t\t\t\ta stumbling-block and a pestilence in great houses and great affairs, and\n\t\t\t\t\toftentimes overturns kingdoms and principalities. Wherefore it is no small\n\t\t\t\t\ttask, nor a matter requiring but slight foresight, to subject it to\n\t\t\t\t\texamination, so that, being thoroughly exposed, it may be prevented from\n\t\t\t\t\tinjuring or discrediting friendship. Vermin depart from dying persons and\n\t\t\t\t\tforsake their bodies, as the blood, from which the vermin derive their\n\t\t\t\t\tsustenance, loses its vitality ; and so flatterers are never so much \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tas to be seen coming near where succulence and warmth\n\t\t\t\t\tare lacking, but where renown and power attend, there do they throng and\n\t\t\t\t\tthrive; but if a change come, they slink away quickly and are gone. But we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust not wait until that experience shall befall, which is a thing\n\t\t\t\t\tprofitless, or rather injurious and not devoid of danger. For it is cruel to\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscover friends that are no friends at a crucial time which calls for\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends, since there is then no exchanging one that is untrustworthy and\n\t\t\t\t\tspurious for the true and trustworthy. But one's friend, like a coin, should\n\t\t\t\t\thave been examined and approved before the time of need, not proved by the\n\t\t\t\t\tneed to be no friend. For we must not wait for injury to open our eyes, but\n\t\t\t\t\tto avoid injury we must gain acquaintance with the flatterer and learn how\n\t\t\t\t\tto detect him; otherwise we shall be in the same case with those who try to\n\t\t\t\t\tlearn about deadly drugs by tasting them first, and so ruin and destroy\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves in order to reach their decision. We do not, of course, commend\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch persons, nor again those who rate the friend as something noble and\n\t\t\t\t\tbeneficial, and so imagine that all who are socially agreeable at once stand\n\t\t\t\t\topenly convicted of being flatterers. For a friend is not unpleasant or\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolute, nor is it bitterness and sternness that give dignity to\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship, but this very nobility and dignity in it is sweet and desirable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tand not merely for one who is in misfortune  as Euripides  has it, but when friendship attends us,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tit brings pleasure and delight to our prosperity no less\n\t\t\t\t\tthan it takes away the griefs and the feeling of helplessness from\n\t\t\t\t\tadversity. As Evenus  has remarked that fire is the best of sauce, so God,\n\t\t\t\t\tby commingling friendship with our life, has made everything cheerful, sweet\n\t\t\t\t\tand agreeable, when friendship is there to share in our enjoyment. Indeed,\n\t\t\t\t\thow the flatterer could use pleasures to insinuate himself, if he saw that\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship was nowhere ready to welcome what is pleasant, no man can\n\t\t\t\t\texplain. But just as false and counterfeit imitations of gold imitate only\n\t\t\t\t\tits brilliancy and lustre, so apparently the flatterer, imitating the\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant and attractive characteristics of the friend, always presents\n\t\t\t\t\thimself in a cheerful and blithe mood, with never a whit of crossing or\n\t\t\t\t\topposition. But that is no reason why persons who express commendation\n\t\t\t\t\tshould instantly be suspected of being simply flatterers. For commendation\n\t\t\t\t\tat the right time is no less becoming to friendship than is censure, or we\n\t\t\t\t\tmay express it better by saying that complaining and fault-finding generally\n\t\t\t\t\tis unfriendly and unsociable, whereas the kindly feeling that ungrudgingly\n\t\t\t\t\tand readily bestows commendation for noble acts inclines us, at some later\n\t\t\t\t\ttime, cheerfully and without distress to bear admonishment and frankness of\n\t\t\t\t\tspeech, since we believe, and are content, that the man who is glad to\n\t\t\t\t\tcommend blames only when he must."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "3", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "v1.p.273"}, "note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Against Conon"}], "#text": "Men too poor to afford a servant, and hence obliged to carry their own bottle of oil to the bath.

For as Plato  says,\n\t\t\t\t\t and so the flattery which we must regard as difficult to\n\t\t\t\t\tdeal with is that which is hidden, not that which is openly avowed, that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is serious, not that which is meant as a joke. For such flattery\n\t\t\t\t\tinfects even true friendship with distrust, unless we give heed, for in many\n\t\t\t\t\trespects it coincides with friendship. Now it is true that Gobryas, having\n\t\t\t\t\tforced his way into a dark room along with the fleeing Magian, and finding\n\t\t\t\t\thimself engaged in a desperate struggle, called upon Darius, who had stopped\n\t\t\t\t\tbeside them and was in doubt what to do, to strike even though he should\n\t\t\t\t\tpierce them both  ; but we, if we can by no means approve the sentiment,\n\t\t\t\t\t \n                have great\n\t\t\t\t\tcause to fear in seeking to detach the flatterer, who through many\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarities is closely interlocked with the friend, lest in some way we\n\t\t\t\t\teither cast out the useful along with the bad, or else, in trying to spare\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is close to our hearts, we fall upon what is injurious. So, I think,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen wild seeds which have a shape and size approximating to wheat have got\n\t\t\t\t\tmixed with it, the process of cleaning is difficult (for either they do not\n\t\t\t\t\tpass out through a finer sieve, or else they do pass out through a coarser,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the wheat along with them) ; in like manner, flattery which blends\n\t\t\t\t\titself with every emotion, every movement, need, and habit, is hard to\n\t\t\t\t\tseparate from friendship."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "5", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.277"}, {"@id": "v1.p.279"}], "quote": {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Trag.

And inasmuch\n\t\t\t\t\tas that which most especially cements a friendship begun is a likeness of\n\t\t\t\t\tpursuits and characters, and since to take delight in the same things and\n\t\t\t\t\tavoid the same things is what generally brings people together in the first\n\t\t\t\t\tplace, and gets them acquainted through the bond of sympathy, the flatterer\n\t\t\t\t\ttakes note of this fact, and adjusts and shapes himself, as though he were\n\t\t\t\t\tso much inert matter, endeavouring to adapt and mould himself to fit those\n\t\t\t\t\twhom he attacks through imitation; and he is so supple in changes and so\n\t\t\t\t\tplausible in his copyings that we may exclaim :  But the most unprincipled trick of all that he has is this :\n\t\t\t\t\tperceiving that frankness of speech, by common report and belief, is the\n\t\t\t\t\tlanguage of friendship especially (as an animal has its peculiar cry), and,\n\t\t\t\t\ton the other hand, that lack of frankness is unfriendly and ignoble, he does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot allow even this to escape imitation, but, just as clever cooks employ\n\t\t\t\t\tbitter extracts and astringent flavourings to remove the cloying effect of\n\t\t\t\t\tsweet things, so flatterers apply a frankness which is not genuine or\n\t\t\t\t\tbeneficial, but which, as it were, winks while it frowns, and does nothing\n\t\t\t\t\tbut tickle. For these reasons, then, the man is hard to detect, as is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase with some animals to which Nature has given the faculty of changing\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir hue, so that they exactly conform to\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthe colours\n\t\t\t\t\tand objects beneath them. And since the flatterer uses resemblances to\n\t\t\t\t\tdeceive and to wrap about him, it is our task to use the differences in\n\t\t\t\t\torder to unwrap him and lay him bare, in the act, as Plato  puts it, of"}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "6", "p": {"quote": {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Trag.

In the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst place, it is necessary to observe the uniformity and permanence of his\n\t\t\t\t\ttastes, whether he always takes delight in the same things, and commends\n\t\t\t\t\talways the same things, and whether he directs and ordains his own life\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to one pattern, as becomes a free-born man and a lover of\n\t\t\t\t\tcongenial friendship and intimacy ; for such is the conduct of a friend. But\n\t\t\t\t\tthe flatterer, since he has no abiding-place of character to dwell in, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsince he leads a life not of his own choosing but another's, moulding and\n\t\t\t\t\tadapting himself to suit another, is not simple, not one, but variable and\n\t\t\t\t\tmany in one, and, like water that is poured into one receptacle after\n\t\t\t\t\tanother, he is constantly on the move from place to place, and changes his\n\t\t\t\t\tshape to fit his receiver. The capture of the ape, as it seems, is effected\n\t\t\t\t\twhile he is trying to imitate man by moving and dancing as the man does :\n\t\t\t\t\tbut the flatterer himself leads on and entices others, not imitating all\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons alike, but with one he joins in dancing and singing, and with\n\t\t\t\t\tanother in wrestling and getting covered with dust; if he gets hold of a\n\t\t\t\t\thuntsman fond of the chase, he follows on, all but shouting out the words of\n\t\t\t\t\tPhaedra  : \n\t\t\t\t\t          \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe does not trouble himself in\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to the quarry, but he goes about to net and ensnare the huntsman\n\t\t\t\t\thimself. But if he is on the track of a scholarly and studious young man,\n\t\t\t\t\tnow again he is absorbed in books, his beard grows down to his feet, the\n\t\t\t\t\tscholar's gown is the thing now and a stoic indifference, and endless talk\n\t\t\t\t\tabout Plato's numbers and right-angled triangles. At another time, if some\n\t\t\t\t\teasy-tempered man fall in his way, who is a hard drinker and rich,  off goes the\n\t\t\t\t\tscholar's gown, the beard is mowed down like an unprofitable crop ; it's\n\t\t\t\t\twine-coolers and glasses now, bursts of laughter while walking in the\n\t\t\t\t\tstreets, and frivolous jokes against the devotees of philosophy. Just so at\n\t\t\t\t\tSyracuse, it is said, after Plato had arrived, and an insane ardour for\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy laid hold on Dionysius, the king's palace was filled with dust by\n\t\t\t\t\treason of the multitude of men that were drawing their geometrical diagrams\n\t\t\t\t\tin it: but when Plato fell out of favour, and Dionysius, shaking himself\n\t\t\t\t\tfree from philosophy, returned post-haste to wine and women and foolish talk\n\t\t\t\t\tand licentiousness, then grossness and forgetfulness and fatuity seized upon\n\t\t\t\t\tthe whole people as though they had undergone a transformation in Circe's\n\t\t\t\t\thouse. A further testimony is to be found in the action of the great\n\t\t\t\t\tflatterers and the demagogues, of whom the greatest was Alcibiades. At\n\t\t\t\t\tAthens he indulged in frivolous jesting, kept a racing-stable, and led a\n\t\t\t\t\tlife full of urbanity and agreeable enjoyment; in Lacedaemon he kept his\n\t\t\t\t\thair cropped close, he wore the coarsest clothing, he bathed in cold water ;\n\t\t\t\t\tin Thrace he was a fighter and a hard drinker : but when he came to\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTissaphernes, he took to soft living, and luxury, and\n\t\t\t\t\tpretentiousness. So by making himself like to all these people and\n\t\t\t\t\tconforming his way to theirs he tried to conciliate them and win their\n\t\t\t\t\tfavour. Not of this type, however, was Epameinondas or Agesilaus, who,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough they had to do with a very large number of men and cities and modes\n\t\t\t\t\tof life, yet maintained everywhere their own proper character in dress,\n\t\t\t\t\tconduct, language, and life.

The true friend is neither an imitator of\n\t\t\t\t\teverything nor ready to commend everything, but only the best things ;  as Sophocles  has it, and most\n\t\t\t\t\tassuredly to share also in right conduct and in love for the good, not in\n\t\t\t\t\terror and evil-doing, unless, as a result of association and close\n\t\t\t\t\tacquaintance, an emanation and infection, like that which comes from a\n\t\t\t\t\tdiseased eye, contaminate him against his will with a touch of baseness or\n\t\t\t\t\terror. In a similar way it is said that close acquaintances used to copy \n\t\t\t\t\tPlato's stoop, Aristotle's lisp, and King Alexander's twisted neck as well\n\t\t\t\t\tas the harshness of his voice in conversation. In fact, some people\n\t\t\t\t\tunconsciously acquire most of their peculiarities from the traits or the\n\t\t\t\t\tlives of others. But the flatterer's case is exactly the same as that of the\n\t\t\t\t\tchameleon. For the chameleon can make\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\thimself like to\n\t\t\t\t\tevery colour except white, and the flatterer, being utterly incapable of\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking himself like to another in any quality that is really worth while,\n\t\t\t\t\tleaves no shameful thing unimitated ; but even as bad painters, who by\n\t\t\t\t\treason of incompetence are unable to attain to the beautiful, depend upon\n\t\t\t\t\twrinkles, moles, and scars to bring out their resemblances, so the flatterer\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes himself an imitator of licentiousness, superstition, passionate anger,\n\t\t\t\t\tharshness toward servants, and distrust toward household and kinsmen. For by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature he is of himself prone to the worse, and he seems very far removed\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom disapproving what is shameful, since he imitates it. In fact it is\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who follow a higher ideal and show distress and annoyance at the\n\t\t\t\t\terrors of their friends, who fall under suspicion. This is the thing that\n\t\t\t\t\tbrought Dion into disfavour with Dionysius, Samius with Philip, Cleomenes\n\t\t\t\t\twith Ptolemy, and finally brought about their undoing. But the flatterer,\n\t\t\t\t\tdesiring to be and to seem pleasant and loyal at the same time, affects to\n\t\t\t\t\ttake greater delight in the worse things, as one who for the great love he\n\t\t\t\t\tbears will take no offence even at what is base, but feels with his friend\n\t\t\t\t\tand shares his nature in all things. For this reason flatterers will not be\n\t\t\t\t\tdenied a share even in the chances of life which happen without our will;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut they flatter the sickly by pretending to be afflicted with the same\n\t\t\t\t\tmalady, and not to be able to see or hear distinctly if they have to do with\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who are dim-sighted or hard of hearing, just as the flatterers of\n\t\t\t\t\tDionysius, whose sight was failing, used to bump against one another and\n\t\t\t\t\tupset the dishes at dinner. And some seize upon afflictions rather as a\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans to insinuate themselves\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tstill more, and carry\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir fellow-feeling so far as to include inmost secrets. If they know, for\n\t\t\t\t\texample, that one or another is unfortunate in his marriage, or suspicious\n\t\t\t\t\ttowards his sons or his household, they do not spare themselves, but lament\n\t\t\t\t\tover their own children or wife or kinsmen or household, divulging certain\n\t\t\t\t\tsecret faults of theirs. For such similarity makes fellow-feeling stronger,\n\t\t\t\t\tso that the others, conceiving themselves to have received pledges, are more\n\t\t\t\t\tinclined to let out some of their own secrets to the flatterers, and having\n\t\t\t\t\tso done they take up with them, and are afraid to abandon the confidential\n\t\t\t\t\trelation. I personally know of one man who put away his wife after his\n\t\t\t\t\tfriend had sent his own away; but he was caught visiting her in secret and\n\t\t\t\t\tsending messages to her after his friend's wife had got wind of what was\n\t\t\t\t\tgoing on. Quite unacquainted with a flatterer, then, was he who thought that\n\t\t\t\t\tthese iambic verses  applied to a flatterer rather than to a crab :  For such a description is that of a parasite, one of  as Eupolis  puts it."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "10", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "v1.p.293"}, "q": [{"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "You laughed inopportunely,"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "but I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnearly died of laughing."}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "but\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat is that compared with this Centaur ?"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "quote": {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Poet.

The distinction lies in referring the pleasure to its\n\t\t\t\t\tend. Look at it in this way: There is a pleasant odour in a perfume, there\n\t\t\t\t\tis a pleasant odour in a medicine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the difference is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the former has been created for pleasure and for nothing else, while in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe latter the purgative, stimulative, or tissue-building principle that\n\t\t\t\t\tgives it value is only incidentally sweet-smelling. Then again, painters mix\n\t\t\t\t\tbright colours and pigments, and there are also some physicians' drugs that\n\t\t\t\t\tare bright in appearance, and have a colour that is not repellent. What,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, is the difference ? Is it not plain that we shall distinguish them by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe end for which they are employed ? So, in a similar way, the graciousness\n\t\t\t\t\tof friends, in addition to goodness and profit, possesses also the power of\n\t\t\t\t\tgiving pleasure as a sort of efflorescence, and there are times when friends\n\t\t\t\t\tenjoy together jest and food and wine, and indeed even mirth and nonsense,\n\t\t\t\t\tas a sort of spice for noble and serious things. To this purport it has been\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid:  and  But the whole work and final aim of the flatterer is always to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe serving up some spicy and highlyseasoned jest or prank or story, incited\n\t\t\t\t\tby pleasure and to incite pleasure.  To put it in few words, the flatterer\n\t\t\t\t\tthinks he ought to do anything to be agreeable, while the friend, by doing\n\t\t\t\t\talways what he ought to do, is oftentimes agreeable and oftentimes\n\t\t\t\t\tdisagreeable, not from any desire to be disagreeable, and yet not attempting\n\t\t\t\t\tto avoid even this if it be better. For he is like a physician, who, if it\n\t\t\t\t\tbe for the good of the patient, administers saffron or spikenard, and indeed\n\t\t\t\t\toftentimes prescribes a\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tgrateful bath or generous diet,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut there are cases where he lets all these go and drops in a dose of\n\t\t\t\t\tcastor, or else of  or he compounds some hellebore and makes a man drink it down,\n\t\t\t\t\tsetting neither in this case the disagreeable nor in the other the agreeable\n\t\t\t\t\tas his final aim, but endeavouring through either course to bring his\n\t\t\t\t\tpatient to one state\u2014that which is for his good. So it is with the friend;\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes by constantly exalting and gladdening another with praise and\n\t\t\t\t\tgraciousness he leads him on toward that which is honourable, as did he who\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid  and  Or again, when there is need of reprehension, he\n\t\t\t\t\tassails with stinging words and all the frankness of a guardian: \n\t\t\t\t\tThere are times, too, when he combines deeds with words, as did Menedemus,\n\t\t\t\t\twho chastened the profligate and disorderly son of his friend Asclepiades by\n\t\t\t\t\tshutting the door upon him and not speaking to him ; and Arcesilaus forbade\n\t\t\t\t\tBaton his lecture-room when the latter had composed a comic line on\n\t\t\t\t\tCleanthes, and it was only when Baton had placated Cleanthes and was\n\t\t\t\t\trepentant that Arcesilaus became reconciled with him. For one ought to hurt\n\t\t\t\t\ta friend\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tonly to help him ; and ought not by hurting him\n\t\t\t\t\tto kill friendship, but to use the stinging word as a medicine which\n\t\t\t\t\trestores and preserves health in that to which it is applied. Wherefore a\n\t\t\t\t\tfriend, like a skilled musician, in effecting a transition to what is noble\n\t\t\t\t\tand beneficial, now relaxes and now tightens a string, and so is often\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant and always profitable; but the flatterer, being accustomed to play\n\t\t\t\t\this accompaniment of pleasantness and graciousness in one key only, knows\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing either of acts of resistance or of words that hurt, but is guided by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other's wish only, and makes every note and utterance to accord with\n\t\t\t\t\thim. As Xenophon  says of Agesilaus, that he was glad to be commended by\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who were willing to blame him also, so we must regard that which gives\n\t\t\t\t\tdelight and joy as true to friendship, if at times it is able also to hurt\n\t\t\t\t\tour feelings and to resist our desires ; but we must be suspicious of an\n\t\t\t\t\tassociation that is confined to pleasures, one whose complaisance is unmixed\n\t\t\t\t\tand without a sting ; and we ought in fact to keep in mind the saying of the\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartan, who, when Charillus the king was commended, said,"}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "12", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.301"}, {"@id": "v1.p.303"}, {"@id": "v1.p.305"}], "note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The grain, after being winnowed, was heaped on the threshing-floor."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Thuc. iii. 82."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Republic"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cf. supra"}], "#text": ", 474 E;  45 A."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cf."}, "#text": "Ptolemy Philopator (221-205 B.C.);  Polybius, v. 34."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Life of Antony"}, "#text": "See Plutarch, , chap. ix.

Wherefore in this matter especially it is necessary to keep the\n\t\t\t\t\tjudgement awake and on the alert, to see whether the praise is for the\n\t\t\t\t\taction or for the man. It is for the action if they praise us in absence\n\t\t\t\t\trather than in our presence ; also if they, too, cherish the same desires\n\t\t\t\t\tand\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\taspirations themselves and praise not us alone but\n\t\t\t\t\tall persons for like conduct; also if they are not found doing and saying\n\t\t\t\t\tnow this and now the opposite ; but, chief of all, if we ourselves know that\n\t\t\t\t\twe feel no regret for those actions for which we are praised, no feeling of\n\t\t\t\t\tshame and no wish that we had said or done the opposite. For if our own\n\t\t\t\t\tconscience protests and refuses to accept the praise, then it is not\n\t\t\t\t\taffected or touched, and is proof against assault by the flatterer. Yet, in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome way that passes my knowledge, most people have no patience with efforts\n\t\t\t\t\tto console them in their misfortunes, but are more influenced by those who\n\t\t\t\t\tcommiserate and condole with them ; and whenever these same people are\n\t\t\t\t\tguilty of mistakes and blunders, the man who by chiding and blaming implants\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sting of repentance is taken to be an enemy and an accuser, whereas they\n\t\t\t\t\twelcome the man who praises and extols what they have done, and regard him\n\t\t\t\t\tas kindly and friendly. Now those who unthinkingly praise and join in\n\t\t\t\t\tapplauding an act or a saying, or anything offered by another, whether he be\n\t\t\t\t\tin earnest or in jest, are harmful only for the moment and for the matter at\n\t\t\t\t\thand; but those who with their praises pierce to the man's character, and\n\t\t\t\t\tindeed even touch his habit of mind with their flattery, are doing the very\n\t\t\t\t\tthing that servants do who steal not from the heap  but from the seed-corn.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor, since the disposition and character are the seed from which actions\n\t\t\t\t\tspring, such persons are thus perverting the very first principle and\n\t\t\t\t\tfountain-head of living, inasmuch as they are investing vice with the names\n\t\t\t\t\tthat belong to \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue. Amid factions and wars, Thucydides  says,\n\t\t\t\t\t And so in attempts at flattery we should\n\t\t\t\t\tbe observant and on our guard against prodigality being called  cowardice \n\t\t\t\t\timpulsiveness  stinginess  the amorous man  the irascible and overbearing \n\t\t\t\t\tthe insignificant and meek  So Plato  somewhere says\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the lover, being a flatterer of his beloved, calls one with a snub nose\n\t\t\t\t\t one with a hooked nose \n\t\t\t\t\tdark persons  and fair persons  ; while  is purely the creation\n\t\t\t\t\tof a lover who calls sallowness by this endearing term, and cheerfully puts\n\t\t\t\t\tup with it. And yet an ugly man who is made to believe that he is handsome,\n\t\t\t\t\tor a short man that he is tall, is not for long a party to the deception,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the injury that he suffers is slight and not irremediable. But as for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe praise which accustoms a man to treat vices as virtues, so that he feels\n\t\t\t\t\tnot disgusted with them but delighted, which also takes away all shame for\n\t\t\t\t\this errors\u2014this is the sort that brought afflictions upon the people of\n\t\t\t\t\tSicily, by calling the savage cruelty of Dionysius and of Phalaris  ; this it is that ruined Egypt,  by giving\n\t\t\t\t\tto Ptolemy's effeminacy, his religious mania, his hallelujahs, his clashing\n\t\t\t\t\tof cymbals, the name of\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t           and  ; this it\n\t\t\t\t\tis that all but subverted and destroyed the character of the Romans in those\n\t\t\t\t\tdays, by trying to extenuate Antony's  luxuriousness, his excesses and\n\t\t\t\t\tostentatious displays, as  What else\n\t\t\t\t\twas it that fastened the mouthpiece and flute upon Ptolemy  ?

Let us, as the next step, look at the subject of\n\t\t\t\t\tfrankness. As Patroclus, when he equipped himself with the armour of\n\t\t\t\t\tAchilles, and drove forth his horses to battle, did not venture to touch the\n\t\t\t\t\tPelian spear, but left that, and that only, behind, so the flatterer, when\n\t\t\t\t\the arrays himself to masquerade in the badges and insignia proper to a\n\t\t\t\t\tfriend, ought to leave frankness alone as the one thing not to be touched or\n\t\t\t\t\timitated, as though it were a choice piece of equipment,  belonging to friendship only. But since they shrink from the\n\t\t\t\t\texposure that awaits them in laughter and wine, and in jest and jollity, and\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir next effort is to raise their business to a serious  level, by\n\t\t\t\t\tputting a stern face on their flattery, and tempering it with a little blame\n\t\t\t\t\tand admonition, let us not neglect to examine this point also. My mind is\n\t\t\t\t\tthis : Just as in Menander's comedy  the sham Heracles comes on carrying a\n\t\t\t\t\tclub which is not solid nor strong, but a light and hollow counterfeit, so\n\t\t\t\t\tthe flatterer's frankness will appear, if we test it, to be soft and without\n\t\t\t\t\tweight or firmness, just like women's cushions, which, while they seem to\n\t\t\t\t\tsupport and to offer resistance to their heads, yet rather yield and give\n\t\t\t\t\tway to them ; and in the same way this counterfeit frankness, through having\n\t\t\t\t\ta hollow, false, and unsound bulk, is inflated and swollen, to the intent\n\t\t\t\t\tthat later when it contracts and collapses it may \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\ttake in and drag along with it the man who throws\n\t\t\t\t\thimself upon it. For the true frankness such as a friend displays applies\n\t\t\t\t\titself to errors that are being committed ; the pain which it causes is\n\t\t\t\t\tsalutary and benignant, and, like honey, it causes the sore places to smart\n\t\t\t\t\tand cleanses them too,  but in its other uses it is wholesome and sweet;\n\t\t\t\t\tthis later shall have a chapter to itself. But the flatterer, in the first\n\t\t\t\t\tplace, makes a parade of harshness and of being acrimonious and inexorable\n\t\t\t\t\tin his bearing towards others. For he is rough with his own servants, and\n\t\t\t\t\tvery quick to pounce on the errors of his kinsmen and household, refusing to\n\t\t\t\t\tadmire or extol any outsider but rather despising all such ; he is\n\t\t\t\t\trelentless in his efforts to stir up others to anger by his slanders ; his\n\t\t\t\t\taim is to get the name of a hater of iniquity, and to give the impression\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he would not willingly abate his frankness to please others, nor do or\n\t\t\t\t\tsay anything at all to curry favour. In the second place, he pretends not to\n\t\t\t\t\tknow or notice a single real and important misdeed, but he is very quick to\n\t\t\t\t\tswoop down upon trifling and immaterial shortcomings, and to indulge in an\n\t\t\t\t\tintense and vehement tirade if he sees that a bit of furniture is carelessly\n\t\t\t\t\tplaced, if he sees that a man is a poor manager, if anyone is careless about\n\t\t\t\t\thaving his hair cut or about his clothing, or does not give proper care to\n\t\t\t\t\tsome dog or horse ; but let a man disregard his parents, neglect his\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren, insult his wife, disdain his household, squander his money, all\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is nothing to him, but in the midst of such matters he is mute and\n\t\t\t\t\tcraven, like a trainer who allows an athlete to get drunk and live loosely,\n\t\t\t\t\tand then is very stern about oilflask \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tand flesh-scraper, or like a schoolmaster who scolds a\n\t\t\t\t\tboy about his slate and pencil, and affects not to hear his blunders in\n\t\t\t\t\tgrammar and diction. For the flatterer is the sort of person who will not\n\t\t\t\t\tsay a word regarding the actual discourse of a cheap and ridiculous speaker,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut will find fault with his voice, and accuse him severely because he ruins\n\t\t\t\t\this throat by drinking cold water ; or if he is requested to look over a\n\t\t\t\t\twretched piece of writing, he will find fault with the paper for being\n\t\t\t\t\trough, and call the copyist abominably careless. So it was with the\n\t\t\t\t\tflatterers of Ptolemy,  who posed as a lover of learning; they would contend\n\t\t\t\t\twith him about an obscure word or a trifling verse or a point of history,\n\t\t\t\t\tand keep it up till midnight; but when he indulged in wanton cruelty and\n\t\t\t\t\tviolence, played the cymbals and conducted his initiations, not one of all\n\t\t\t\t\tthese people opposed his course. Just imagine a man using a surgeon's lancet\n\t\t\t\t\tto cut the hair and nails of a person suffering from tumours and abscesses !\n\t\t\t\t\tYet this is the sort of thing that flatterers do, who apply their frankness\n\t\t\t\t\tto those parts that feel no hurt or pain."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "18", "p": {"q": [{"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "Heavens, what gross absurdity !"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "What's that you say ?"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "pb": {"@id": "v1.p.323"}, "#text": "I confess that I feel troubled and indignant at seeing that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall you sons of Zeus alike show favour to flatterers and ridiculous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons.

But we come now to matters that are a\n\t\t\t\t\tserious problem, and do great damage to the foolish, when the flatterer's\n\t\t\t\t\taccusations are directed against emotions and weaknesses the contrary to\n\t\t\t\t\tthose that a person really has. For example, Himerius the flatterer used to\n\t\t\t\t\tvilify a man, the most illiberal and avaricious of the rich men at Athens,\n\t\t\t\t\tas a careless profligate destined to starve miserably together with his\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren. Or again, on the other hand, they will reproach profligate and\n\t\t\t\t\tlavish spenders with meanness and sordidness (as Titus Petronius did with\n\t\t\t\t\tNero) ; or they will bid rulers who deal savagely and fiercely with their\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects to lay aside their excessive clemency and their inopportune and\n\t\t\t\t\tunprofitable pity. Very like to these also is the man who pretends to be on\n\t\t\t\t\this\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tguard against some simple and stupid fool, and to\n\t\t\t\t\tfear him as a clever rascal; and so, too, if a malicious person, and one\n\t\t\t\t\tthat delights in constant evil-speaking and fault-finding, be induced to\n\t\t\t\t\tcommend some man of note, a flatterer of this stamp takes him straight in\n\t\t\t\t\thand, and contradicts him, declaring that it is a weakness of his to commend\n\t\t\t\t\teven the worthless.  Especially in regard to love affairs they\n\t\t\t\t\tbeset their victims and add fuel to their fire. Likewise if they see that\n\t\t\t\t\tany are in disagreement with their brothers, or that they contemn their\n\t\t\t\t\tparents, or deal scornfully with their wives, they do not admonish or\n\t\t\t\t\tarraign them, but try to intensify such feelings.  they say, and,  And if, as a result of temper and jealousy, a\n\t\t\t\t\tfeeling of irritation is engendered toward a mistress or another man's wife\n\t\t\t\t\twith whom the man has a love-affair, in comes flattery at once with a\n\t\t\t\t\tsplendid frankness, adding fire to fire, pleading for justice, accusing the\n\t\t\t\t\tlover of many unloving, obdurate, and reprehensible actions :  So the friends of Antony, who was consumed\n\t\t\t\t\twith love of the Egyptian woman, tried to make him believe that she was\n\t\t\t\t\tenamoured of him, and, upbraiding him, they would call him cold and haughty\n\t\t\t\t\t:  He was pleased at being taken to task for such\n\t\t\t\t\twrongdoing, and taking more pleasure in those who accused him than he did\n\t\t\t\t\teven in any who commended him, he failed to see that by this seeming\n\t\t\t\t\tadmonition he was being perversely drawn towards her. Such frankness is like\n\t\t\t\t\tthe love bites of lascivious women ; it arouses and tickles the sense of\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure by pretending to cause pain. So undiluted wine is of itself a\n\t\t\t\t\thelpful remedy for the hemlock poison, but if they add it to hemlock and mix\n\t\t\t\t\tthe two together they make the potency of the drug quite beyond remedy,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince it is rapidly carried to the heart by the heat. In like manner the\n\t\t\t\t\tunscrupulous, being well aware that frankness is a great remedy for\n\t\t\t\t\tflattery, flatter by means of frankness itself. It is for this reason that\n\t\t\t\t\tBias did not give a good answer to the man who asked him  when he replied,  For it were\n\t\t\t\t\tnearer the truth to say, that among flatterers those who hover about the\n\t\t\t\t\tbath and the table are domesticated, whereas he that extends his meddling\n\t\t\t\t\tand slander and malice like tentacles into the bedchamber and the women's\n\t\t\t\t\tprivacy, is an uncivilized brute and most hard to handle."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "20", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.329"}, {"@id": "v1.p.331"}], "q": [{"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "Are you angry ?

There are some sorts of food,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example, that are without affinity for either the blood or the breath,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich add no vigour to nerves or marrow, but only excite the lower passions,\n\t\t\t\t\tarouse the appetite, and make unsound flesh that is morbid within. So the\n\t\t\t\t\tflatterer's talk adds nothing to the thinking and reasoning powers, but only\n\t\t\t\t\tpromotes familiarity with some amorous pleasure, intensifies a foolish fit\n\t\t\t\t\tof temper, provokes envy, engenders an offensive and inane bulk of conceit,\n\t\t\t\t\tcommiserates in distress, or, by a succession of slanders and forebodings,\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses malice, illiberality and distrust to grow bitter, timorous, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsuspicious ; and these are all matters that will not escape the observant.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the flatterer is always covertly on the watch for some emotion, and\n\t\t\t\t\tpampering it, and his presence is like that of a tumour in that he ever\n\t\t\t\t\tcomes immediately following some morbid or inflamed condition of the soul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t          \n\t\t\t\t\t          \n\t\t\t\t\t           But if it is\n\t\t\t\t\thard to detect the flatterer when he is engaged with these major emotions,\n\t\t\t\t\tinasmuch as our power to reason is deranged by their vehemence and\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnitude, yet with the lesser ones he will better give a vantage, since his\n\t\t\t\t\tbehaviour here will be the same. For example, if a man is afraid that he may\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\thave a headache or a digestive upset from drinking\n\t\t\t\t\tor eating to excess, and hesitates about bathing and taking food, a friend\n\t\t\t\t\twill try to hold him back, and advise him to be careful and cautious, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe flatterer drags him off to the baths, and bids him order some novel\n\t\t\t\t\tdish, and not to maltreat his body by forced abstinence. And if he sees his\n\t\t\t\t\tman to be feebly inclined towards some journey or voyage or undertaking, he\n\t\t\t\t\twill say that the occasion is not pressing but that they will accomplish the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame result by postponement or by sending somebody else. If the man, after\n\t\t\t\t\tpromising money as a loan or a gift to some personal friend, wants to change\n\t\t\t\t\this mind, but is ashamed to do so, the flatterer throws his weight upon the\n\t\t\t\t\tworse inclination, strengthens his opinion touching his purse, and banishes\n\t\t\t\t\this feeling of mortification, bidding him be economical, since he has many\n\t\t\t\t\texpenses and many mouths to feed. It follows, therefore, that if we are not\n\t\t\t\t\tunaware of our own feelings of covetousness, shamelessness, and cowardice,\n\t\t\t\t\twe shall not be unaware of the flatterer. For he always acts as an advocate\n\t\t\t\t\tof such emotions, and is frank in discussing the results to which they lead.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis, then, is enough on this subject."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "21", "p": {"q": [{"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "language of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttruth,"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "simple,"}], "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Phoenissae"}, "#text": "Euripides, , 469, 472."}, "pb": {"@id": "v1.p.333"}, "#text": "Let us come without more ado to the topic of services and ministrations ; for\n\t\t\t\t\tit is in these that the flatterer brings about a great confusion and\n\t\t\t\t\tuncertainty in regard to the difference between himself and the friend,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause he appears to be brisk and eager in everything and never to make an\n\t\t\t\t\texcuse.

It is the same with actions :\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends omit many of the trifling formalities, not being at all exacting or\n\t\t\t\t\tofficious in this respect, not putting themselves forward for every kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tministration ; whereas the flatterer is in these matters persistent,\n\t\t\t\t\tassiduous, and untiring, giving to no one else place or space for a good\n\t\t\t\t\toffice, but he is eager for orders, and if he receives none he is nettled,\n\t\t\t\t\tor rather he is utterly dispirited and gives way to lamentations."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "22", "p": {"quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Il."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Od."}], "#text": "Homer,  xiv. 196; xviii. 427;  v. 90."}, "#text": "Yes, if I\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave the power, and if it can be accomplished,"}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Il."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Od. v. 89."}], "#text": "Homer,  xiv. 195; xviii. 426;"}, "#text": "Speak what you have in mind."}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Com.

We need first, however, to consider the difference\n\t\t\t\t\tshown by the two men in offering their services. It has been well said by\n\t\t\t\t\twriters before our time that a friend's offer takes this form :  while a flatterer's is like\n\t\t\t\t\tthis :  In fact the comic poets introduce on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe stage characters of this sort:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t           In the second place, no friend enters into\n\t\t\t\t\tcooperation unless he has first been taken into consultation, and then only\n\t\t\t\t\tafter he has examined the undertaking and agreed in setting it down as\n\t\t\t\t\tfitting or expedient; but if anyone concedes to the flatterer an opportunity\n\t\t\t\t\tto take part in examining and pronouncing upon some matter in hand, inasmuch\n\t\t\t\t\tas he not only desires to yield and give gratification, but also fears to\n\t\t\t\t\tafford suspicion that he may draw back and avoid the task, he gives way and\n\t\t\t\t\tadds his urgency to the other's desires. For it is not easy to find a\n\t\t\t\t\twealthy man or a king who will say :  but such people, like the tragedians, want to have a\n\t\t\t\t\tchorus of friends singing the same tune or a sympathetic audience to applaud\n\t\t\t\t\tthem. This is the reason why Merope in the tragedy gives this advice :  But such people\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally do just the opposite ; they abominate those who are  who take a stand against them for their own\n\t\t\t\t\tgood, while  the \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tservile impostors, they receive not only within their\n\t\t\t\t\t but even within their secret emotions and\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerns. The more simple-minded of such flatterers does not think it\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary or proper that he be taken into consultation regarding matters of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis sort, but only that he be a ministrant and servant; whereas the more\n\t\t\t\t\tunscrupulous will do no more than to join in the deliberation, contracting\n\t\t\t\t\this brows, and looking his assent, but says not a word. However, if the\n\t\t\t\t\tother man states his view, then he says,  Now the\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematicians tell us that surfaces and lines do not bend or extend or move\n\t\t\t\t\tof themselves, being imaginary conceptions without material substance, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they bend and extend and change their position along with the bodies of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich they are the boundaries : so, too, you shall detect the flatterer by\n\t\t\t\t\this being always in agreement with his victim in words and expressions,\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2014yes, in pleasures and in angry passions too\u2014so that in these matters, at\n\t\t\t\t\tleast, the difference is quite easy to detect. Still more is this evident in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe manner of his ministrations. For a gracious act on the part of a friend\n\t\t\t\t\tis like a living thing : it has its most potent qualities deep within it,\n\t\t\t\t\tand there is nothing on the surface to suggest show or display ; but, as a\n\t\t\t\t\tphysician cures without his patient's knowledge, so oftentimes a friend does\n\t\t\t\t\ta good turn by interceding or by settling, while the object of his\n\t\t\t\t\tsolicitude knows nothing of it. Such a friend was Arcesilaus in all his\n\t\t\t\t\tdealings, and this was especially seen of him when he discovered the poverty\n\t\t\t\t\tof Apelles of Chios, who was ill; for on his next visit he came with twenty\n\t\t\t\t\tshillings, and taking a seat by the bed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tremarked,\n\t\t\t\t\t And with that he re-arranged his pillow, and,\n\t\t\t\t\tunobserved, slipped the money underneath. When the aged servingwoman\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscovered it, and in amazement announced her discovery to Apelles, he said\n\t\t\t\t\twith a laugh,  Moreover,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe saying that  \n               \n\t\t\t\t\tholds true in the field of philosophy. At any rate, Lacydes, the associate\n\t\t\t\t\tof Arcesilaus, stood by Cephisocrates, as did his other friends, when he was\n\t\t\t\t\timpeached ;  and when the prosecutor demanded his ring, Cephisocrates\n\t\t\t\t\tquietly let it fall beside him, and Lacydes, perceiving this, put his foot\n\t\t\t\t\ton it and concealed it; for the tell-tale evidence was in the ring. After\n\t\t\t\t\tthe verdict, Cephisocrates was shaking hands with the jurors, when one of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, who apparently had seen what happened, bade him thank Lacydes, and\n\t\t\t\t\trelated the whole affair ; but Lacydes had told it to nobody. So, too, I\n\t\t\t\t\timagine the gods confer their benefits, for the most part, without our\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge, since it is their nature to take pleasure in the mere act of\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing gracious and doing good. But the flatterer's activity shows no sign of\n\t\t\t\t\thonesty, truth, straightforwardness, or generosity, but only sweating and\n\t\t\t\t\tclamour and running to and fro, and a strained look that gives the\n\t\t\t\t\tappearance and suggestion of onerous and urgent business. It is like an\n\t\t\t\t\textravagantly wrought picture, which by means of gaudy pigments, irregular\n\t\t\t\t\tfolds in the garments, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\twrinkles, and sharp angles, strives to produce an\n\t\t\t\t\timpression of vividness. He is offensive, too, as he relates how he has had\n\t\t\t\t\tto go hither and thither on the business, how he has worried over it, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, as he tells of all the enmity he has incurred, and then of his\n\t\t\t\t\tcountless troubles and great tribulations ; and, as a result, he gets a\n\t\t\t\t\tdeclaration that it was not worth all that. For any favour that evokes a\n\t\t\t\t\treproach from its recipient is offensive, disfavoured, intolerable; and in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe flatterer's favours there is this reproach and mortification, which is\n\t\t\t\t\tfelt, not at some later time, but at the very time when they are performed.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut if a friend has to tell what he has done, he reports it modestly and\n\t\t\t\t\tsays nothing about himself. It was in this spirit that the Lacedaemonians\n\t\t\t\t\tsent corn to the people of Smyrna in their need, and when these expressed\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir admiration of the gracious action, the Lacedaemonians said,  Such\n\t\t\t\t\tgraciousness is not only the mark of a generous spirit, but it is pleasanter\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the recipients, since they feel that those who assist them suffer no\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat damage."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "23", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.343"}, {"@id": "v1.p.345"}], "quote": {"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Iphigenia at Aulis"}, "#text": "Euripides, , 407."}, "#text": "In virtue joins, and not in viciousness."}, "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Moralia"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Life of Phocion"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Life of Agis"}], "#text": "Again referred to by Plutarch, , 142 B, 188 F; , chap. xxx.

For a friend will not, as Gorgias was wont to\n\t\t\t\t\tdeclare, expect his friend to support him in honest projects, and yet\n\t\t\t\t\thimself serve the other in many also that are dishonest, for he\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t           Much rather,\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, will he try to turn his friend aside from what is unbecoming ;\n\t\t\t\t\tand if he cannot persuade him, then he may well retort with Phocion's remark\n\t\t\t\t\t to Antipater :  that is as a friend and not a friend. For one should\n\t\t\t\t\tassist a friend in doing, not in misdoing, in advising, not in ill-devising,\n\t\t\t\t\tin supporting his conclusions, not his delusions, in sharing his mishaps,\n\t\t\t\t\tnot his misdeeds. No, we would choose not even to have knowledge of our\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends' dishonourable actions ; how then can we possibly choose to\n\t\t\t\t\tcooperate in them and to share in the unseemly conduct ? As the\n\t\t\t\t\tLacedaemonians, defeated in battle by Antipater, in making terms of peace\n\t\t\t\t\tbade him prescribe any penalty he would, but nothing dishonourable, so a\n\t\t\t\t\tfriend, if need befall for his services that involves expense, danger, or\n\t\t\t\t\tlabour, is foremost in insisting, without excuse or hesitation, that he be\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled upon and that he do his share, but wherever disgrace goes with it, he\n\t\t\t\t\tis also foremost in begging to be left alone and spared from participation.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut flattery, on the contrary, in arduous and dangerous ministrations fails\n\t\t\t\t\tyou, and if you test it by sounding, it does not ring clear, but has an\n\t\t\t\t\tignoble tone jangling with some excuse; but for any shameful, mean, or\n\t\t\t\t\tdisreputable service you may use the flatterer as you will, and treat him as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe dirt beneath your feet; and he thinks it nothing dreadful or insulting.\n\t\t\t\t\tYou must have noticed the ape. He cannot guard the house like the dog, nor\n\t\t\t\t\tcarry a load like the horse, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tnor plough the land like oxen ; and so he has to bear\n\t\t\t\t\tabuse and scurrility, and endure practical jokes, thus submitting to be made\n\t\t\t\t\tan instrument of laughter. So also with the flatterer : unable to help\n\t\t\t\t\tanother with words or money or to back him in a quarrel, and unequal to\n\t\t\t\t\tanything laborious or serious, yet he makes no excuses when it comes to\n\t\t\t\t\tunderhand actions, he is a faithful helper in a love-affair, he knows\n\t\t\t\t\texactly the price to be paid for a prostitute, he is not careless in\n\t\t\t\t\tchecking up the charge for a wine supper, nor slow in making arrangements\n\t\t\t\t\tfor dinners, he tries to be in the good graces of mistresses; but if bidden\n\t\t\t\t\tto be impudent toward a wife's relatives or to help in hustling a wife out\n\t\t\t\t\tof doors he is relentless and unabashed. As a result the man is not hard to\n\t\t\t\t\tdetect in this way, either ; for if he is told to do any disreputable and\n\t\t\t\t\tdishonourable thing that you will, he is ready to be prodigal of himself in\n\t\t\t\t\ttrying to gratify the man who tells him to do it."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "24", "p": {"note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "De amicorum multitudine"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Moralia"}], "#text": "Plutarch has devoted a separate essay () to this subject (, 93 B-79 B)."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Orestes"}, "#text": "Euripides, , 735."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Poet.

But the flatterer is false, spurious, and debased,\n\t\t\t\t\tinasmuch as he fully understands that he is committing a crime against\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship, which in his hands becomes a counterfeit coin as it were. While\n\t\t\t\t\the is by nature jealous, yet he employs his jealousy against his own kind,\n\t\t\t\t\tstriving constantly to outdo them in scurrility\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tand idle\n\t\t\t\t\tgossip, but he stands in awesome dread of his betters, not indeed because he\n\t\t\t\t\tis  but because, as Simonides  puts\n\t\t\t\t\tit, he \n\t\t\t\t\tWhenever, then, the flatterer, who is but a light and deceptive plated-ware,\n\t\t\t\t\tis examined and closely compared with genuine and solid-wrought friendship,\n\t\t\t\t\the does not stand the test, but he is exposed, and so he does the same thing\n\t\t\t\t\tas the man who had painted a wretched picture of some cocks. For the painter\n\t\t\t\t\tbade his servant scare all real cocks as far away as possible from the\n\t\t\t\t\tcanvas ; and so the flatterer scares all real friends away, and does not\n\t\t\t\t\tallow them to come near ; or if he cannot accomplish this, he openly cringes\n\t\t\t\t\tto them, pays them attentions, and makes a great show of respect for them as\n\t\t\t\t\tfor superiors, but secretly he is suggesting and spreading some sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tcalumny ; and when secret talk has caused an irritating sore, even though he\n\t\t\t\t\tbe not entirely successful at the outset, yet he remembers and observes the\n\t\t\t\t\tprecept of Medius. This Medius was, if I may call him so, leader and skilled\n\t\t\t\t\tmaster of the choir of flatterers that danced attendance on Alexander, and\n\t\t\t\t\twere banded together against all good men. Now he urged them not to be\n\t\t\t\t\tafraid to assail and sting with their calumnies, pointing out that, even if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe man who is stung succeeds in healing the wound, the scar of the calumny\n\t\t\t\t\twill still remain. In fact it was by such scars, or rather such gangrenes\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tand cancers, that Alexander was consumed so that he\n\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed Callisthenes, Parmenio, and Philotas, and put himself without\n\t\t\t\t\treserve into the hands of men like Hagno, Bagoas, Agesias, and Demetrius, to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe brought low, by submitting to be worshipped, bedecked and fantastically\n\t\t\t\t\ttricked out by them, after the manner of a barbaric idol. So great is the\n\t\t\t\t\tpower wielded by giving gratification, and it is greatest, apparently, with\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who seem to be the greatest personages. For self-conceit regarding the\n\t\t\t\t\tnoblest qualities, coupled with the wish to have them, gives both confidence\n\t\t\t\t\tand boldness to the flatterer. It is true that lofty places are difficult\n\t\t\t\t\tof approach and access for those who propose to capture them, but loftiness\n\t\t\t\t\tor conceit, in a mind which lacks sense because of the favours of Fortune or\n\t\t\t\t\tNature, lies at the mercy of the insignificant and mean."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "25", "p": {"q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "Know thyself,"}, "note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Life of Alexander"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Moralia"}], "#text": "Plutarch, , chap. xxii.

And again, among those few you cannot\n\t\t\t\t\teasily find men who know how to do this, but rather you shall find those who\n\t\t\t\t\tthink that if they abuse and find fault they use frankness. Yet frankness,\n\t\t\t\t\tlike any other medicine, if it be not applied at the proper time, does but\n\t\t\t\t\tcause useless suffering and disturbance, and it accomplishes, one may say,\n\t\t\t\t\tpainfully what flattery accomplishes pleasantly. For people are injured, not\n\t\t\t\t\tonly by untimely praise, but by untimely blame as well; and it is this\n\t\t\t\t\tespecially that delivers them over, broadside on, to the flatterers, an easy\n\t\t\t\t\tprey, since like water they glide away from the steeps that repel toward the\n\t\t\t\t\tvalleys that softly invite. Frankness, therefore, should be combined with\n\t\t\t\t\tgood manners, and there should be reason in it to take away its excess and\n\t\t\t\t\tintensity, which may be compared to that of light, so that any who are\n\t\t\t\t\texposed to it shall not, for being disturbed and distressed by those who\n\t\t\t\t\tfind fault with everything and accuse every one, take refuge in the shadow\n\t\t\t\t\tof the flatterer, and turn away towards what does not cause pain. Now every\n\t\t\t\t\tform of vice, my dear Philopappus, is to be avoided through virtue, and not\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough the vice that is its antithesis, as some people, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance, think to escape bashfulness through\n\t\t\t\t\tshamelessness, rusticity through scurrility, and to make their manner to be\n\t\t\t\t\tfarthest removed from cowardice and softness if they can make themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tseem nearest to impudence and boldness. Others again, to prove themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tfree from superstition, adopt atheism, and play the knave to show that they\n\t\t\t\t\tare not fools, and thus distort their character, like a piece of wood, from\n\t\t\t\t\tone form of crookedness to its opposite, because they do not know how to\n\t\t\t\t\tstraighten it. But the most shameful way of disavowing the name of flatterer\n\t\t\t\t\tis to cause pain without profit; and it shows an utterly rude and tactless\n\t\t\t\t\tdisregard of goodwill in one's relations with friends to resort to being\n\t\t\t\t\tdisagreeable and harsh in order to avoid abasement and servility in\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship. Such a person is like a freedman of the comic stage, who thinks\n\t\t\t\t\tthat abuse is a fair use of equal speech. Since, therefore, it is a shameful\n\t\t\t\t\tthing to fall into flattery in aiming to please, and a shameful thing also,\n\t\t\t\t\tin trying to avoid flattery, to destroy the friendly thoughtfulness for\n\t\t\t\t\tanother by immoderate liberty of speech, we ought to keep ourselves from\n\t\t\t\t\tboth the one and the other extreme, and in frankness, as in anything else,\n\t\t\t\t\tachieve the right from the mean. The subject itself requiring, as it does,\n\t\t\t\t\tconsequent elaboration, seems to determine that this be the final complement\n\t\t\t\t\tof our work."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "26", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.355"}, {"@id": "v1.p.357"}], "quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Il."}, "#text": "Homer,  xiv. 84."}, "#text": "Hopeless and helpless !

For people are wont to\n\t\t\t\t\tthink that anger, not goodwill, is the motive of a man who\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tspeaks on his own behalf, and that this is not admonition but\n\t\t\t\t\tfault-finding. For frankness is friendly and noble, but fault-finding is\n\t\t\t\t\tselfish and mean. For this reason those who speak frankly are respected and\n\t\t\t\t\tadmired, while fault-finders meet with recrimination and contempt.\n\t\t\t\t\tAgamemnon, for instance, has no patience with Achilles, who appears to have\n\t\t\t\t\tspoken with moderate frankness only, but when Odysseus assails him bitterly\n\t\t\t\t\tand says,  he yields and puts up with it, quieted by the friendly\n\t\t\t\t\tconcern and good sense of the other's words. For Odysseus, who had no ground\n\t\t\t\t\tfor anger personally, spoke boldly to him in behalf of Greece, while\n\t\t\t\t\tAchilles seemed to be incensed chiefly on his own account. And it is true\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Achilles himself, although he was  \n                but a  submitted himself to Patroclus in silence, although Patroclus\n\t\t\t\t\toften launched upon him strictures like this :  The orator\n\t\t\t\t\tHypereides  used to tell the Athenians that it was only right that they\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider, not merely whether he was bitter, but whether he was so upon no\n\t\t\t\t\tcause ; and in the same way, the admonition of \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\ta thing to be treated with respect and reverence, not to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe faced out. And if one also makes it clear that in speaking frankly he is\n\t\t\t\t\tleaving out of all account or consideration his friend's lapses toward\n\t\t\t\t\thimself, but taking him to task for certain other shortcomings, and that it\n\t\t\t\t\tis in the interest of other persons that he visits him with stinging reproof\n\t\t\t\t\tso unsparingly, the force of such frankness is irresistible, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerous attitude of the speaker serves only to intensify the bitterness and\n\t\t\t\t\tseverity of his admonition. Therefore, while it has been well said that when\n\t\t\t\t\twe are angry or at variance with friends, we ought then most of all to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdoing or planning what will be for their advantage or interest, yet it is no\n\t\t\t\t\tless material in friendship, when we feel that we ourselves are slighted and\n\t\t\t\t\tneglected, to speak frankly in behalf of others who are likewise being\n\t\t\t\t\tneglected, and to remind our friends of them. For example, Plato, in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmidst of suspicions and disagreements with Dionysius, asked him for an\n\t\t\t\t\tappointment for an interview, and Dionysius granted it, supposing that Plato\n\t\t\t\t\thad some long tale of fault-finding to rehearse on his own account. But\n\t\t\t\t\tPlato talked with him somewhat after this fashion : \n\t\t\t\t\t           said Dionysius, \n\t\t\t\t\t           said Plato,  When\n\t\t\t\t\tDionysius asked who the man was,  he said,  These words so moved\n\t\t\t\t\tDionysius, that he straightway embraced Plato affectionately, marvelling at\n\t\t\t\t\this kindliness and high-mindedness, and afterwards he paid to Aeschines\n\t\t\t\t\thonourable and distinguished attentions."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "27", "p": {"note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Moralia"}, "#text": "The story is repeated by Plutarch, , 179 B, 334 D, and 634 D."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Caesar Augustus."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Frogs"}, "#text": "Aristophanes, for example, as in the  686 ff."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Poet.

Just as a certain orderliness and\n\t\t\t\t\tneatness should pervade the work of a surgeon when he performs an operation,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut his hand should forbear all dancing and reckless motions, all flourishes\n\t\t\t\t\tand superfluity of gesticulation, so frankness has plenty of room for tact\n\t\t\t\t\tand urbanity, if such graciousness does not impair the high office of\n\t\t\t\t\tfrankness ; but when effrontery and offensiveness and arrogance are coupled\n\t\t\t\t\twith it, they spoil and ruin it completely. There was point, therefore, and\n\t\t\t\t\tpolish in the retort with which the harper  stopped Philip's mouth when\n\t\t\t\t\tPhilip attempted to argue with him about playing upon his instrument.\n\t\t\t\t\t said he,  But Epicharmus was not right in his retort upon Hiero, who\n\t\t\t\t\thad made away with some of his intimate friends, and then a few days later\n\t\t\t\t\tinvited\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpicharmus to dinner.  said Epicharmus,  As badly answered Antiphon, when the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion was up for discussion in the presence of Dionysius as to  and he said,  For the offensiveness and bitterness of such retorts\n\t\t\t\t\tprofits nothing, their scurrility and frivolity gives no pleasure ; but a\n\t\t\t\t\tretort of this kind betokens intemperance of the tongue combined with malice\n\t\t\t\t\tand arrogance, and not without enmity.

It\n\t\t\t\t\tis true that the comic poets  addressed to their audiences many stern\n\t\t\t\t\trebukes of value to the citizens ; but the admixture of drollery and\n\t\t\t\t\tscurrility in them, like a vile dressing with food, made their frankness\n\t\t\t\t\tineffective and useless, so that there was nothing left for the authors but\n\t\t\t\t\ta name of malice and coarseness, and no profit for the hearers from their\n\t\t\t\t\twords. On other occasions jest and laughter may well enough be employed with\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends, but frankness of speech ought to have seriousness and\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter. And if it concern matters of greater moment,\n\t\t\t\t\tlet feeling be so evident, the countenance so serious, and the voice so\n\t\t\t\t\tearnest that the words may claim credence and touch the heart.

It is like overcasting fair weather\n\t\t\t\t\twith a storm-cloud, when in the midst of jesting and merrymaking someone\n\t\t\t\t\tstarts a discussion that makes others frown and sets the face in rigid\n\t\t\t\t\tlines, as though the topic were meant to combat the god of Relaxation who\n\t\t\t\t\t as Pindar  puts it.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis neglect of occasion contains a great danger also. For men's minds are\n\t\t\t\t\tperilously inclined to anger on account of the wine, and oftentimes heavy\n\t\t\t\t\tdrinking takes control of their frankness and creates enmity. And in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral, it does not show a noble or stout heart, but unmanliness rather,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor one who never displays boldness of speech when he is sober to be bold at\n\t\t\t\t\ttable, as is the way of cowardly curs.

For there are few persons who in good fortune have still a sober mind\n\t\t\t\t\t; most have need of discretion and reason to be put into them from without,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich shall repress them when they are puffed up and unsettled with the\n\t\t\t\t\tfavours of fortune. But when the Heavenly power casts them down and strips\n\t\t\t\t\toff their importance, there is in these calamities alone admonition enough\n\t\t\t\t\tto work repentance. Wherefore at such a time there is no use for a friend's\n\t\t\t\t\tfrankness or for words charged with grave and stinging reproof; but in such\n\t\t\t\t\treversals truly  when he offers\n\t\t\t\t\tconsolation and encouragement. And this was true of Clearchus, the sight of\n\t\t\t\t\twhose face, Xenophon  says, so kindly and benevolent in the midst of  strengthened the confidence of the men in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe face of danger. But he who applies frankness of speech and stinging\n\t\t\t\t\treproof to a person in misfortune, might as well apply some stimulant of\n\t\t\t\t\tvision to a disordered and inflamed eye ; he effects no cure nor any\n\t\t\t\t\tabatement of the pain, but only adds irritation to the painfulness, and\n\t\t\t\t\texasperates the sufferer. Thus no man in good health, for instance, is at\n\t\t\t\t\tall harsh or ferocious against a friend who blames him for yielding to women\n\t\t\t\t\tand wine, or for being lazy and neglecting to take exercise, or for\n\t\t\t\t\tindulging perpetually in baths or\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tunseasonable\n\t\t\t\t\tgourmandise. But for a man who is sick it is intolerable, nay, an\n\t\t\t\t\taggravation of the sickness, to be told, \n\t\t\t\t\t           Under such conditions, then, the very\n\t\t\t\t\tcircumstances in which the unfortunate find themselves leave no room for\n\t\t\t\t\tfrank speaking and sententious saws, but they do require gentle usage and\n\t\t\t\t\thelp. When children fall down, the nurses do not rush up to them to berate\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, but they take them up, wash them, and straighten their clothes, and,\n\t\t\t\t\tafter all this is done, they then rebuke and punish them. It is said that\n\t\t\t\t\twhen Demetrius of Phalerum had been banished from his native land and was\n\t\t\t\t\tliving in obscurity and humble station near Thebes, he was not well pleased\n\t\t\t\t\tto see Crates approaching, anticipating some cynical frankness and harsh\n\t\t\t\t\tlanguage. But Crates met him with all gentleness, and conversed with him\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerning the subject of banishment, how there was nothing bad in it, nor\n\t\t\t\t\tany good cause to feel distress, since thus he was set free from a hazardous\n\t\t\t\t\tand insecure office ; at the same time he urged him not to be discouraged\n\t\t\t\t\tover himself and his present condition. Whereupon Demetrius, becoming more\n\t\t\t\t\tcheerful and once more taking heart, said to his friends,  \n               \n\t\t\t\t\t          \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis\n\t\t\t\t\tis the way of noble friends, but the ignoble and degraded flatterers of the\n\t\t\t\t\tfortunate are  which, as\n\t\t\t\t\tDemosthenes  says,  and so these persons have a clinging fondness for reverses,\n\t\t\t\t\tas though they were pleased with them and derived enjoyment from them.

It so happened that Socrates had handled one of his\n\t\t\t\t\tacquaintances rather severely in a conversation which took place close by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe money-changers', whereupon Plato said,  Socrates retorted,  And again, when Pythagoras once assailed a devoted\n\t\t\t\t\tpupil pretty roughly in the presence of several persons, the youth, as the\n\t\t\t\t\tstory goes, hanged himself, and from that time on Pythagoras never\n\t\t\t\t\tadmonished anybody when anyone else was present. For error should be treated\n\t\t\t\t\tas a foul disease, and all admonition and disclosure should be in secret,\n\t\t\t\t\twith nothing of show or display in it to attract a crowd of witnesses and\n\t\t\t\t\tspectators. For it is not like friendship, but sophistry, to seek for glory\n\t\t\t\t\tin other men's faults, and to make a fair show before the spectators, like\n\t\t\t\t\tthe physicians who perform operations in the theatres with an eye to\n\t\t\t\t\tattracting patients. Quite apart from the affront involved\u2014which ought never\n\t\t\t\t\tto be allowed in any corrective treatment\u2014 some regard must be paid to the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontentiousness and self-will that belong to vice ; for it is not enough to\n\t\t\t\t\tsay, as Euripides  has it, that  but if\n\t\t\t\t\tadmonition be offered in public, and unsparingly,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tit\n\t\t\t\t\tonly confirms each and every morbid emotion in its shamelessness. Hence,\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as Plato  insists that elderly men who are trying to cultivate a sense\n\t\t\t\t\tof respect among the young, must themselves, first of all, show respect for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe young, so among friends a modest frankness best engenders modesty, and a\n\t\t\t\t\tcautious quiet approach and treatment of the erring one saps the foundations\n\t\t\t\t\tof his vice and annihilates it, since it gradually becomes imbued with\n\t\t\t\t\tconsideration for the consideration shown to it. It follows, then, that the\n\t\t\t\t\tbest way is to  And least of all is it decent to expose a husband in the hearing of his\n\t\t\t\t\twife, and a father in the sight of his children, and a lover in the presence\n\t\t\t\t\tof his beloved, or a teacher in the presence of his students : for such\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons are driven almost insane with grief and anger at being taken to task\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore those with whom they feel it is necessary to stand well. I imagine\n\t\t\t\t\talso that it was not so much the wine that caused Cleitus  to be so\n\t\t\t\t\texasperating to Alexander, as that he gave the impression of trying to curb\n\t\t\t\t\thim before a large company. And Aristomenes, Ptolemy's  tutor, because he\n\t\t\t\t\tgave Ptolemy a slap to wake him up, as he was nodding while an embassy was\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent, thereby afforded a hold to the flatterers, who affected to be\n\t\t\t\t\tindignant on the king's behalf, and said,  ; and\n\t\t\t\t\tPtolemy sent a goblet of poison with orders that\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthe man should drink it off. So, too, Aristophanes \n\t\t\t\t\tsays that Cleon accused him because\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthus trying to exasperate the Athenians against\n\t\t\t\t\thim. This blunder, therefore, along with the others,\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be guarded against by those who desire, not\n\t\t\t\t\tto show off, or to win popularity, but to employ\n\t\t\t\t\tfrank speaking in a way that is beneficial and\n\t\t\t\t\tsalutary. In feet, persons that use frank speaking\n\t\t\t\t\tought to be able to say what Thucydides  represents\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Corinthians as saying about themselves, that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey \u2014which\n\t\t\t\t\tis not a bad way of putting it. For as Lysander,\n\t\t\t\t\twe are told, said to the man from Megara, who in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe council of the allies was making bold to speak\n\t\t\t\t\tfor Greece, that  ; so it may well be that every man's\n\t\t\t\t\tfrank speaking needs to be backed by character, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is especially true in the case of those who\n\t\t\t\t\tadmonish others and try to bring them to their\n\t\t\t\t\tsober senses. Plato  at any rate used to say that\n\t\t\t\t\the admonished Speusippus by his life, as, to be sure,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe mere sight of Xenocrates in the lecture-room, and\n\t\t\t\t\ta glance from him, converted Polemon and made\n\t\t\t\t\thim a changed man.

For example, whenever it either\n\t\t\t\t\tbecomes necessary to divert persons that are on the\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint of going wrong, or when we would give an\n\t\t\t\t\tearnest impulse to those who are trying to make a\n\t\t\t\t\tstand against the onset of a violent adverse impulse,\n\t\t\t\t\tor who are quite without energy and spirit for what\n\t\t\t\t\tis noble, we should turn round and ascribe their\n\t\t\t\t\taction to some unnatural or unbecoming motives.\n\t\t\t\t\tThus Odysseus, as Sophocles  represents him, in\n\t\t\t\t\ttrying to rouse the spirit of Achilles, says that\n\t\t\t\t\tAchilles is not angry on account of the dinner, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t          \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd again when Achilles is exceedingly indignant\n\t\t\t\t\tat this, and says that he is for sailing away, Odysseus\n\t\t\t\t\tsays\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSo by alarming the spirited and manly man with an\n\t\t\t\t\timputation of cowardice, the chaste and orderly with\n\t\t\t\t\tan imputation of licentiousness, the liberal and lordly\n\t\t\t\t\twith an imputation of pettiness and stinginess, they\n\t\t\t\t\tgive to such persons an impulse toward what is\n\t\t\t\t\tnoble, and turn them away from what is disgraceful,\n\t\t\t\t\tproving themselves moderate in matters beyond\n\t\t\t\t\tremedy, and owning more to sorrow and sympathy\n\t\t\t\t\tthan to blame in their frank speaking ; but in efforts\n\t\t\t\t\tto prevent the commission of error and in any\n\t\t\t\t\twrestling with the emotions they are severe, inexorable, and unremitting. For this is the right time\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a resolute goodwill and genuine frankness.\n\t\t\t\t\tBlame for past deeds is a weapon which we see\n\t\t\t\t\tenemies using against each other. Whereby is\n\t\t\t\t\tconfirmed the saying of Diogenes that as a matter\n\t\t\t\t\tof self-preservation, a man needs to be supplied with\n\t\t\t\t\tgood friends or else with ardent enemies ; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer instruct him, and the latter take him to task.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut it is better to guard against errors by following\n\t\t\t\t\tproffered advice than to repent of errors because of\n\t\t\t\t\tmen's upbraiding. This is the reason why it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary to treat frankness as a fine art, inasmuch\n\t\t\t\t\tas it is the greatest and most potent medicine in\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship, always needing, however, all care to hit\n\t\t\t\t\tthe right occasion, and a tempering with moderation."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "37", "p": "Since, then, as has been said, frankness, from\n\t\t\t\t\tits very nature, is oftentimes painful to the person\n\t\t\t\t\tto whom it is applied, there is need to follow the\n\t\t\t\t\texample of the physicians ; for they, in a surgical\n\t\t\t\t\toperation, do not leave the part that has been operated\n\t\t\t\t\tupon in its suffering and pain, but treat it with\n\t\t\t\t\tsoothing lotions and fomentations ; nor do persons\n\t\t\t\t\tthat use admonition with skill simply apply its\n\t\t\t\t\tbitterness and sting, and then run away ; but by\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther converse and gentle words they mollify and\n\t\t\t\t\tassuage, even as stone-cutters smooth and polish the\n\t\t\t\t\tportions of statues that have been previously\n\t\t\t\t\thammered and chiselled.
