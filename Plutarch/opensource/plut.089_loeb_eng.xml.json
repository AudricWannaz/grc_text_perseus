On the fourth day Isis was born in the regions\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are ever moist; and on the fifth Nephthys, to\n\t\t\t\t\twhom they give the name of Finality and the name\n\t\t\t\t\tof Aphrodit, and some also the name of Victory.\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is also a tradition that Osiris and Arueris were\n\t\t\t\t\tsprung from the Sun, Isis from Hermes, and Typhon\n\t\t\t\t\tand Nephthys from Cronus.

For the same reason many of the Greeks\n\t\t\t\t\tmake statues of Dionysus in the form of a bull; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe women of Elis invoke him, praying that the god\n\t\t\t\t\tmay come with the hoof of a bull; and the epithet\n\t\t\t\t\tapplied to Dionysus among the Argives is  They call him up out of the water by the sound\n\t\t\t\t\tof trumpets, at the same time casting into the depths\n\t\t\t\t\ta lamb as an offering to the Keeper of the Gate. The\n\t\t\t\t\ttrumpets they conceal in Bacchic wands, as Socrates\n\t\t\t\t\thas stated in his treatise on The Holy Ones.
