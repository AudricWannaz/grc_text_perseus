For\n\t\t\t\t\tby this reasoning Epicurus will be shown to be a\n\t\t\t\t\tworse man than Gorgias the sophist, and Metrodorus\n\t\t\t\t\tworse than Alexis the comic poet; for Alexis lived\n\t\t\t\t\ttwice as long as Metrodorus and Gorgias more than\n\t\t\t\t\ta third as long again as Epicurus. It is in another\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tsense that we speak of virtue as something strong,\n\t\t\t\t\tand vice as something weak, not with reference to\n\t\t\t\t\tpermanence or dissolution of the body. For example,\n\t\t\t\t\tmany of the animals that are sluggish in movement and slow in their reactions and many that are\n\t\t\t\t\tlascivious and ungovernable live a longer time than\n\t\t\t\t\tthe quick and the clever. Therefore they do not\n\t\t\t\t\twell who make God's eternal existence to be the\n\t\t\t\t\tresult of watchfulness and the thrusting aside of\n\t\t\t\t\tdestructive agencies. No, immunity from emotion\n\t\t\t\t\tand destruction ought to reside in the blessed Being,\n\t\t\t\t\tand should require no activity on His part. Perhaps,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, to speak thus with reference to people that\n\t\t\t\t\tare not present does not show great consideration.\n\t\t\t\t\tSo it is right that Cleombrotus should resume the\n\t\t\t\t\ttopic which he discontinued a few moments ago\n\t\t\t\t\tabout the migration and flight of the demigods."}, "#text": "After these remarks Ammonius said,"}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "21", "p": {"q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "infra"}], "#text": "421 f, ."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf.

It\n\t\t\t\t\twas near the Persian Gulf that I found him, where he\n\t\t\t\t\tholds a meeting with human beings once every year ;\n\t\t\t\t\tand there I had an opportunity to talk with him and\n\t\t\t\t\tmet with a kindly reception. The other days of his\n\t\t\t\t\tlife, according to his statement, he spends in association with roving nymphs and demigods. He was the\n\t\t\t\t\thandsomest man I ever saw in personal appearance\n\t\t\t\t\tand he never suffered from any disease, inasmuch as\n\t\t\t\t\tonce each month he partook of the medicinal and\n\t\t\t\t\tbitter fruit of a certain herb. He was practised in the\n\t\t\t\t\tuse of many tongues ; but with me, for the most part,\n\t\t\t\t\the spoke a Doric which was almost music. While he\n\t\t\t\t\twas speaking, a fragrance overspread the place, as\n\t\t\t\t\this mouth breathed forth a most pleasant perfume.\n\t\t\t\t\tBesides his learning and his knowledge of history,\n\t\t\t\t\talways at his command, he was inspired to prophesy\n\t\t\t\t\tone day in each year when he went down to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsea and told of the future. Potentates and kings'\n\t\t\t\t\tsecretaries would come each year and depart. His\n\t\t\t\t\tpower of prophecy he referred to the demigods. He\n\t\t\t\t\tmade most account of Delphi and there was none of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe stories told of Dionysus or of the rites performed\n\t\t\t\t\there of which he had not heard ; these too he assert ed\n\t\t\t\t\twere the momentous experiences of the demigods\n\t\t\t\t\tand so, plainly, were those which had to do with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Python. And upon the slayer of that monster\n\t\t\t\t\twas not imposed an exile of eight full years, nor,\n\t\t\t\t\tfollowing this, was he exiled to Temp; but after\n\t\t\t\t\the was expelled, he fared forth to another world,\n\t\t\t\t\tand later, returning from there, after eight cycles\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Great Years, pure and truly the  he took over the oraele which had been\n\t\t\t\t\tguarded during this time by Themis. Such also, he\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid, were the stories about Typhons and Titans;\n\t\t\t\t\tbattles of demigods against demigods had taken\n\t\t\t\t\tplace, followed by the exile of the vanquished, or else\n\t\t\t\t\tjudgement inflicted by a god upon the sinners, as, for\n\t\t\t\t\texample, for the sin which Typhon is said to have\n\t\t\t\t\tcommitted in the case of Osiris, or Cronus in the case\n\t\t\t\t\tof Uranus ; and the honours once paid to these\n\t\t\t\t\tdeities have become quite dim to our eyes or have\n\t\t\t\t\tvanished altogether when the deities were transferred\n\t\t\t\t\tto another world. In fact, I learn that the Solymi,\n\t\t\t\t\twho live next to the Lycians, paid especial honour to\n\t\t\t\t\tCronus. But when lie had slain their rulers, Arsalus,\n\t\t\t\t\tDryus, and Trosobius, he fled away from that place\n\t\t\t\t\tto some place or other, where they cannot say ; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthen he ceased to be regarded, but Arsalus and those\n\t\t\t\t\tconnected with him are called the  and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Lycians employ their names in invoking curses\n\t\t\t\t\tboth in public and in private. Many accounts\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar to these are to be had from theological\n\t\t\t\t\thistory. But, as that man said, if we call some of the\n\t\t\t\t\tdemigods by the current name of gods, that is no cause\n\t\t\t\t\tfor wonder ; for each of them is wont to be called\n\t\t\t\t\tafter that god with whom he is allied and from whom'\n\t\t\t\t\the has derived his portion of power and honour.

Then again it is more consistent with reason\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the world should not be the only-begotten of\n\t\t\t\t\tGod and quite alone. For He, being consummately\n\t\t\t\t\tgood, is lacking in none of the virtues, and least of all\n\t\t\t\t\tin those which concern justice and friendliness ; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthese are the fairest and are fitting for gods. Nor is\n\t\t\t\t\tit in the nature of God to possess anything to no\n\t\t\t\t\tpurpose or for no use. Therefore there exist other\n\t\t\t\t\tgods and other worlds outside, in relation with\n\t\t\t\t\twhich He exercises the social virtues. For not in\n\t\t\t\t\trelation with Himself nor with any part of Himself\n\t\t\t\t\tis there any exercise of justice or benevolence or\n\t\t\t\t\tkindness, but only in relation with others. Thus it\n\t\t\t\t\tis not likely that this world, friendless, neighbourless,\n\t\t\t\t\tand unvisited, swings back and forth in the infinite\n\t\t\t\t\tvoid, since we see that Nature includes individual\n\t\t\t\t\tthings in classes and species, like seeds in pods and\n\t\t\t\t\tenvelopes. For there is nothing in the whole list of\n\t\t\t\t\texisting things for which there is not some general\n\t\t\t\t\tdesignation, nor does anything that does not possess\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain qualities, either in common with others or\n\t\t\t\t\tsolely by itself, obtain such an appellation. Now the\n\t\t\t\t\tworld is not spoken of as having qualities in common\n\t\t\t\t\twith others. It has its qualities, therefore, solely by\n\t\t\t\t\titself, by virtue of the difference when it is compared\n\t\t\t\t\twith other things which are akin to it and similar in\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tappearance, since it has been created with such\n\t\t\t\t\tqualities as it possesses.

Certainly not in relation to the void, for\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to him it does not exist. And according to\n\t\t\t\t\tthose for whom it does exist, it has no centre, just\n\t\t\t\t\tas it has no point where it begins or where it ends ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tfor these are limitations, and the infinite has no limitations. And if a man could force himself, by reasoning, to dare the concept of a violent motion of the\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite, what difference, if referred to this, is created\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the bodies in their movements ? For in the void\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is no power in the bodies, nor do the bodies\n\t\t\t\t\thave a predisposition and an impetus, by virtue of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich they cling to the centre and have a universal\n\t\t\t\t\ttendency in this one direction. It is equally difficult,\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of inanimate bodies and an incorporeal and\n\t\t\t\t\tundifferentiated position, to conceive of a movement\n\t\t\t\t\tcreated from the bodies or an attraction created by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe position. Thus one conclusion is left : when the\n\t\t\t\t\tcentre is spoken of it is not with reference to any\n\t\t\t\t\tplace, but with reference to the bodies. For in this\n\t\t\t\t\tworld of ours, which has a single unity in its organization from numerous dissimilar elements, these differences necessarily create various movements towards\n\t\t\t\t\tvarious objects. Evidence of this is found in the fact\n\t\t\t\t\tthat everything, when it undergoes transformation,\n\t\t\t\t\tchanges its position coincidently with the change\n\t\t\t\t\tin its substance. For example, dispersion distributes\n\t\t\t\t\tupwards and round about the matter rising from the\n\t\t\t\t\tcentre and condensation and consolidation press it\n\t\t\t\t\tdown towards the centre and drive it together."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "27", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v.5.p.431"}, {"@id": "v.5.p.433"}], "note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf.

It happens,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, that they do not all have one form of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstruction, nor have they all a similar origin, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe pyramid is the simplest and smallest, while the\n\t\t\t\t\tdodecahedron is the largest and most complicated.\n\t\t\t\t\tOf the remaining two the icosahedron is more than\n\t\t\t\t\tdouble the octahedron in the number of its triangles.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor this reason it is impossible for them all to derive\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir origin from one and the same matter. For those\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are simple and small and more rudimentary\n\t\t\t\t\tin their structure would necessarily be the first to\n\t\t\t\t\trespond to the instigating and formative power, and\n\t\t\t\t\tto be completed and acquire substantiality earlier\n\t\t\t\t\tthan those of large parts and many bodies, from\n\t\t\t\t\twhich class comes the dodecahedron, which requires\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tmore labour for its construction. Hence it follows\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the only primal body is the pyramid, and not one\n\t\t\t\t\tof the others, since by their nature they are outdistanced by it in coming into being. Accordingly,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe remedy which exists for this strange state of\n\t\t\t\t\taffairs consists in the division and separation of matter\n\t\t\t\t\tinto five worlds, one where the pyramid shall acquire\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstantiality first, another for the octahedron, and\n\t\t\t\t\tanother for the icosahedron ; then from the one that\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst acquires substantiality in each world the rest\n\t\t\t\t\twill have their origin, since a transmutation for everything into everything takes place according to the\n\t\t\t\t\tadaptability of parts to fit together, as Plato himself\n\t\t\t\t\thas indicated, going into the details of nearly all cases.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut for us it will suffice to acquire the knowledge\n\t\t\t\t\tin brief form. Since air is formed when fire is extinguished, and when rarefied again gives off fire out of\n\t\t\t\t\titself, we must observe the behaviour of each of the\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerative elements and their transmutations. The\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerative elements of fire are the pyramid, composed of twenty-four primary triangles, and likewise\n\t\t\t\t\tfor air the octahedron, composed of forty-eight of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame. Therefore one element of air is produced\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom two corpuscles of fire combined and united ; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of air again, when divided, is separated into two\n\t\t\t\t\tcorpuscles of fire, and again, when compressed and\n\t\t\t\t\tcondensed, it goes off into the form of water. The\n\t\t\t\t\tresult is that in every case the one which first acquires\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstantiality always affords the others a ready means\n\t\t\t\t\tof coming into being through transmutation ; and it\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tis not one alone that first exists, but another in a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent environment is endowed with movement,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich takes the lead and forestalls the others in\n\t\t\t\t\tcoming into being, and thus the name of being first\n\t\t\t\t\tis kept by all."}], "#text": "said I,"}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "33", "p": {"q": [{"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "Manfully and zealously,"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "pb": {"@id": "v.5.p.447"}, "#text": "have these matters been worked out by Theodorus ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut I should be surprised if it should not appear that\n\t\t\t\t\t\the has made use of assumptions which nullify each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother.

Then, as a corollary to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis, and not conflicting with it, he lays down the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprinciple that not all matter brings forth the simplest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand most rudimentary form first, but that sometimes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ponderous and complex forms, in the time of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoming into being, are earlier in arising out of matter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut apart from this, five bodies having been postulated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas primary, and on the strength of this the number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworlds being put as the same, he adduces probability\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith reference to four only ; the cube he has taken off\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe board, as if he were playing a game with counters,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince, because of its nature, it cannot transmute itself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto them nor confer upon them the power of transmutation into itself, inasmuch as the triangles are not\n\t\t\t\t\t\thomologous triangles.

I repeat, therefore, what I said\n\t\t\t\t\tat the beginning, that if two natures be postulated,\n\t\t\t\t\tone evident to the senses, subject to change in creation and dissolution, carried now here now there,\n\t\t\t\t\twhile the other is essentially conceptual and always\n\t\t\t\t\tremains the same, it is a dreadful thing that, while\n\t\t\t\t\tthe conceptual nature has been parcelled out and\n\t\t\t\t\thas variety within itself, we should feel indignant\n\t\t\t\t\tand annoyed if anyone does not leave the corporeal\n\t\t\t\t\tand passive nature as a unity knit together and converging upon itself, but separates and parts it. For\n\t\t\t\t\tit is surely fitting that things permanent and divine\n\t\t\t\t\tshould hold more closely together and escape, so far\n\t\t\t\t\tas may be, all segmentation and separation.

Wherefore Plato,\n\t\t\t\t\topposing those who declare for the unity of the whole,\n\t\t\t\t\tsays that these five things exist: Being, Identity,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDifferentiation, and, to crown all, Movement and\n\t\t\t\t\tRest. Granted, then, that these five exist, it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tsurprising if each of these five corporeal elements has\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen made into a copy and image of each of them\n\t\t\t\t\trespectively, not unmixed and unalloyed, but it is\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause of the fact that each of them participates\n\t\t\t\t\tmost in its corresponding faculty. The cube is\n\t\t\t\t\tpatently a body related to rest because of the security\n\t\t\t\t\tand stability of its plane surfaces. In the pyramid\n\t\t\t\t\teverybody may note its fiery and restless quality in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe simplicity of its sides and the acuteness of its\n\t\t\t\t\tangles. The nature of the dodecahedron, which is\n\t\t\t\t\tcomprehensive enough to include the other figures,\n\t\t\t\t\tmay well seem to be a model with reference to all\n\t\t\t\t\tcorporeal being. Of the remaining two, the icosahedron shares in the nature of Differentiation mostly,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the octahedron in that of Identity. For this\n\t\t\t\t\treason the octahedron contributed air, which in a\n\t\t\t\t\tsingle form holds all being in its embrace, and the\n\t\t\t\t\ticosahedron water, which by admixture assumes the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatest variety of qualities.

Then, in fact, any of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe larger amounts becomes number through being\n\t\t\t\t\tdelimited by the number one. But if the number\n\t\t\t\t\tone be done away with, once more the indeterminate\n\t\t\t\t\tduality throws all into confusion, and makes it to be\n\t\t\t\t\twithout rhythm, bounds, or measure. Inasmuch as\n\t\t\t\t\tform is not the doing away with matter, but a shaping\n\t\t\t\t\tand ordering of the underlying matter, it needs must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe that both these first principles be existent in\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber, and from this has arisen the first and greatest\n\t\t\t\t\tdivergence and dissimilarity. For the indeterminate\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst principle is the creator of the even, and the better\n\t\t\t\t\tone of the odd. Two is the first of the even numbers\n\t\t\t\t\tand three the first of the odd ; from the two combined comes five, which in its composition is common\n\t\t\t\t\tto both numbers and in its potentiality is odd. For\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the perceptible and corporeal was divided into\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral parts because of the innate necessity of\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiation, that number had to be neither the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst even nor the first odd, but the third number,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is formed from these two, so that it might\n\t\t\t\t\tbe produced from both the primary principles, that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich created the even and that which created the\n\t\t\t\t\todd, because it was not possible for the one to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe divorced from the other ; for each possesses the\n\t\t\t\t\tnature and the potentiality of a first principle. So\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the twro were paired, the better one prevailed\n\t\t\t\t\tover the indeterminate as it was dividing the corporeal\n\t\t\t\t\tand checked it; and when matter was being distributed to the two, it set unity in the middle and\n\t\t\t\t\tdid not allow the whole to be divided into two parts,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut there has been created a number of worlds by\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiation of the indeterminate and by its being\n\t\t\t\t\tcarried in varying directions ; yet the power of\n\t\t\t\t\tIdentity and Limitation has had the effect of making\n\t\t\t\t\tthat number odd, but the kind of odd that did not\n\t\t\t\t\tpermit Nature to progress beyond what is best.

If, therefore, we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust apply reasonable probability to his conception,\n\t\t\t\t\tlet us consider that variations in movement necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\tfollow close upon the variations in the bodies and their\n\t\t\t\t\tshapes, as he himself teaches when he makes it plain\n\t\t\t\t\tthat whatever is disunited or united changes its place\n\t\t\t\t\tat the same time with the alteration of its substance.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor example, if fire is generated from air by the\n\t\t\t\t\tbreaking up of the octahedron and its resolution into\n\t\t\t\t\tpyramids, or again if air is generated from fire by its\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing forced together and compressed into an octahedron, it is not possible for it to stay where it was\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore, but it escapes and is carried to some other\n\t\t\t\t\tplace, forcing its way out and contending against\n\t\t\t\t\tanything that blocks its course or keeps it back.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat takes place he describes more clearly by a\n\t\t\t\t\tsimile, saying that in a manner like to grain and\n\t\t\t\t\tchaff being tossed about and winnowed by the fans\n\t\t\t\t\tand other tools used in cleaning the grain the\n\t\t\t\t\telements toss matter about and are tossed about by\n\t\t\t\t\tit; and like always draws near1 to like, some things\n\t\t\t\t\toccupying one place and others another, before the\n\t\t\t\t\tuniverse becomes completely organized out of the\n\t\t\t\t\telements. Thus, when matter was in that state in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich, in all probability, is the universe from which God\n\t\t\t\t\tis absent, the first five properties, having tendencies\n\t\t\t\t\tof their own, were at once carried in different directions, not being completely or absolutely separated,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause, when all things were amalgamated, the\n\t\t\t\t\tinferior always followed the superior in spite of\n\t\t\t\t\tNature. For this reason they produced in the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent kinds of bodies, as these were carried some\n\t\t\t\t\tin one direction and others in another, an equal\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of separate divisions with intervals between\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, one not of pure fire, but fiery, another not of\n\t\t\t\t\tunmingled ether, but ethereal, another not of earth\n\t\t\t\t\tby itself alone, but earthy ; and above all, in keeping\n\t\t\t\t\twith the close association of air with water, they\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrived, as has been said, that these should come\n\t\t\t\t\taway filled with many foreign elements. It was not\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Deity who parted substance and caused it to rest\n\t\t\t\t\tin different places, but, after it had been parted by its\n\t\t\t\t\town action and was being carried in diverse ways in\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch great disarray, he took it over and set it in\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\torder and fitted it together by the use of proportions\n\t\t\t\t\tand means. Then, after establishing Reason in each as\n\t\t\t\t\ta governor and guardian, he creatjed as many worlds\n\t\t\t\t\tas the existing primal bodies. Let this, then, be an\n\t\t\t\t\toffering for the gratification of Plato on Ammonius's\n\t\t\t\t\taccount, but as for myself, I should not venture to\n\t\t\t\t\tassert regarding the number of wbrlds that they are\n\t\t\t\t\tjust so many ; but the opinion that sets their number\n\t\t\t\t\tat more than one, and yet not infinite, but limited in\n\t\t\t\t\tamount, I regard as no more irrational than either\n\t\t\t\t\tof the others, when I observe the dispersiveness and\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisibility implicit by nature in Matter, and that it\n\t\t\t\t\tneither abides as a unit nor is permitted by Reason to\n\t\t\t\t\tprogress to infinity. But if in any other place we have\n\t\t\t\t\trecalled the Academy to our mind, let us do so here\n\t\t\t\t\tas well, and divest ourselves of excessive credulity\n\t\t\t\t\tand, as if we were in a slippery place in our discussion\n\t\t\t\t\tabout infinity, let us merely keep a firm footing."}}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "38", "p": [{"q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "quote": {"@rend": "blockquote", "#text": "The gods make us to slip by many forms"}, "note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Trag.

For if the souls which have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen severed from a body, or have had no part with\n\t\t\t\t\tone at all, are demigods according to you and the\n\t\t\t\t\tdivine Hesiod,\n\t\t\t\t\t          \n\t\t\t\t\twhy deprive souls in bodies of that power by virtue\n\t\t\t\t\tof which the demigods possess the natural faculty\n\t\t\t\t\tof knowing and revealing future events before they\n\t\t\t\t\thappen ? For it is not likely that any power or portion accrues to souls when they have left the body,\n\t\t\t\t\tif they did not possess them before ; but the souls\n\t\t\t\t\talways possess them ; only they possess them to\n\t\t\t\t\ta slight degree while conjoined with the body, some\n\t\t\t\t\tof them being completely imperceptible and hidden,\n\t\t\t\t\tothers weak and dim, and about as ineffectual and\n\t\t\t\t\tslow in operation as persons that try to see in a fog or\n\t\t\t\t\tto move about in water, and requiring much nursing\n\t\t\t\t\tand restoring of the functions that properly belong to\n\t\t\t\t\tthem and the removal and clearing away of the covering which hides them.

We ought not to feel surprised or incredulous at this when we see in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsoul, though we see naught else, that faculty which\n\t\t\t\t\tis the complement of prophecy, and which we call\n\t\t\t\t\tmemory, and how great an achievement is displayed\n\t\t\t\t\tin preserving and guarding the past, or rather what\n\t\t\t\t\thas been the present, since nothing of all that has\n\t\t\t\t\tcome to pass has any existence or substantiality,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the very instant when anything comes to\n\t\t\t\t\tpass, that is the end of it \u2014 of actions, words, experiences alike ; for Time like an everflowing stream\n\t\t\t\t\tbears all things onward.

Hence, as I said, it is no wonder that, if it has\n\t\t\t\t\tcommand over things that no longer are, it anticipates\n\t\t\t\t\tmany of those which have not yet come to pass, since\n\t\t\t\t\tthese are more closely related to it, and with these\n\t\t\t\t\tit has much in common ; for its attachments and\n\t\t\t\t\tassociations are with the future, and it is quit of all\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is past and ended, save only to remember it."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "40", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v.5.p.469"}, {"@id": "v.5.p.471"}], "note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Apology"}], "#text": "Plato, , 39 b."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Trag.

But my difficulty is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreater and concerns greater matters. I do not know\n\t\t\t\t\t\thow it happened, but a little time ago we yielded to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlogic in wresting the prophetic art from the gods and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransferring it merely to the demigods. But now it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseems to me that we are thrusting out these very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemigods, in their turn, and driving them away from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe oracle and the tripod here, when we resolve the\n\t\t\t\t\t\torigin of prophecy, or rather its very being and power,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto winds and vapours and exhalations.

And what is the significance of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlibations poured over the victims and the refusal to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgive responses unless the whole victim from the hoofjoints up is seized with a trembling and quivering, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe libation is poured over it ? Shaking the head is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot enough, as in other sacrifices, but the tossing and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquivering must extend to all parts of the animal alike\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccompanied by a tremulous sound ; and unless this\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttakes place they say that the oracle is not functioning,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand do not even bring in the prophetic priestess.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYet it is only on the assumption that they ascribe the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcause almost entirely to a god or a demigod that it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\treasonable for them to act and to believe thus ; but\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the basis of what you say it is not reasonable. For\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe presence of the exhalation, whether the victim be\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcited or not, will produce the inspiration and will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdispose the soul auspiciously, not only the soul of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe priestess, but that of any ordinary person with\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhom it may come into contact. Wherefore it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsilly to employ one woman alone for the purpose\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the oracles and to give her trouble by watching\n\t\t\t\t\t\ther to keep her pure and chaste all her life.

Observe first how it is with the\n\t\t\t\t\tartists. Take as our first example the far-famed\n\t\t\t\t\tstand and base for the mixing-bowl here which\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHerodotus has styled the ' bowl-holder '; it came to\n\t\t\t\t\thave as its material causes fire and steel and softening\n\t\t\t\t\tby means of fire and tempering by means of water,\n\t\t\t\t\twithout which there is no expedient by which this\n\t\t\t\t\twork could be produced ; but art and reason supplied\n\t\t\t\t\tfor it the more dominant principle which set all these\n\t\t\t\t\tin motion and operated through them. And, indeed,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe author and creator of these likenesses and portraits here stands recorded in the inscription:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tso that it may be seen that he painted them. But\n\t\t\t\t\twithout pigments ground together, losing their own\n\t\t\t\t\tcolour in the process, nothing could achieve such a\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposition and sight. Does he, then, who is desirous\n\t\t\t\t\tof getting hold of the material cause, as he investigates and explains the behaviour of the red earth of\n\t\t\t\t\tSinop and the changes to which it is subject when\n\t\t\t\t\tmixed with yellow ochre, or of the light-coloured\n\t\t\t\t\tearth of Melos when mixed with lamp-black, take\n\t\t\t\t\taway the repute of the artist ?
