He became enamoured of Roxan, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdaughter of Oxyartes, as she danced among the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptive maidens ; yet he did not offer any violence to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ther, but made her his wife. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen he saw Darius pierced through by javelins,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the did not offer sacrifice nor raise the paean of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictory to indicate that the long war had come to an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend ; but he took off his own cloak and threw it over\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe corpse as though to conceal the divine retribution that waits upon the lot of kings.  Once when he was reading a confidential letter from his mother, and Hephaestion,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho, as it happened, was sitting beside him, was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquite openly reading it too, Alexander did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstop him, but merely placed his own signet-ring on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHephaestion's lips, sealing them to silence with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta friend's confidence.
