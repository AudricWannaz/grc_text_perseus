Is it thus, then, that\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophers also, because of their disagreements\n\t\t\t\t\twith each other, refer some of their questions to the\n\t\t\t\t\tnature of irrational animals, as though to a foreign\n\t\t\t\t\tcity, and submit the decision to the emotions and\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter and habits of these creatures as to a court\n\t\t\t\t\tthat cannot be influenced or bribed? Or is this also\n\t\t\t\t\ta common charge against human depravity - that,\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing in doubt about the most necessary and important things, we seek among horses and dogs and\n\t\t\t\t\tbirds how we ourselves should marry and beget and\n\t\t\t\t\tbring up children (as though we had no plain indication of Nature in ourselves) ; and that we term the\n\t\t\t\t\ttraits which brute beasts have  and\n\t\t\t\t\t and accuse our life of a great deviation\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tand departure from Nature, confused and disordered\n\t\t\t\t\tas we are at the very beginning concerning even\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first principles? For in dumb animals Nature\n\t\t\t\t\tpreserves their special characteristics pure and unmixed and simple, but in men, through reason and\n\t\t\t\t\thabit, they have been modified by many opinions\n\t\t\t\t\tand adventitious judgements so that they have lost\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir proper form and have acquired a pleasing\n\t\t\t\t\tvariety comparable to the variety of perfumes made\n\t\t\t\t\tby the pharmacist on the basis of a single oil. And\n\t\t\t\t\tlet us not wonder if irrational animals follow Nature\n\t\t\t\t\tmore closely than rational ones ; for animals are, in\n\t\t\t\t\tfact, outdone in this by plants, to which Nature has\n\t\t\t\t\tgiven neither imagination nor impulse, nor desire for\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething different, which causes men to shake themselves free from what Nature desires ; but plants, as\n\t\t\t\t\tthough they were fastened in chains, remain in the\n\t\t\t\t\tpower of Nature, always traversing the one path along\n\t\t\t\t\twhich Nature leads them. Yet in wild beasts versatility of reasoning and uncommon cleverness and excessive love of freedom are not too highly developed;\n\t\t\t\t\tand though they have irrational impulses and desires\n\t\t\t\t\tand often wander about on circuitous paths, they do\n\t\t\t\t\tnot go far afield, but ride, as it were, at the anchor\n\t\t\t\t\tprovided by Nature, who points out to them the\n\t\t\t\t\tstraight way, as to an ass which proceeds under bit\n\t\t\t\t\tand bridle.

For just as in uncultivated plants,\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch as wild vines and figs and olives, Nature has\n\t\t\t\t\timplanted the principles, though crude and imperfect,\n\t\t\t\t\tof cultivated fruits, so on irrational animals she has\n\t\t\t\t\tbestowed a love of offspring, though imperfect and\n\t\t\t\t\tinsufficient as regards the sense of justice and one\n\t\t\t\t\twhich does not advance beyond utility ; but in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase of man, a rational and social animal, Nature, by\n\t\t\t\t\tintroducing him to a conception of justice and law and\n\t\t\t\t\tto the worship of the gods and to the founding of cities\n\t\t\t\t\tand to human kindness, has furnished noble and beautiful and fruitful seeds of all these in the joy we have\n\t\t\t\t\tin our children and our love of them, emotions which\n\t\t\t\t\taccompany their first beginnings ; and these qualities\n\t\t\t\t\tare found in the very constitution of their bodies. For\n\t\t\t\t\talthough Nature is everywhere exact and workmanlike\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\twith no deficiency or superfluity,  as\n\t\t\t\t\tErasistratus said,  ; yet\n\t\t\t\t\twhen it comes to the processes of procreation, it is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible to describe them in a fitting manner, and\n\t\t\t\t\tperhaps it would not be decent to fix our attention\n\t\t\t\t\ttoo precisely upon the names and designations of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese forbidden topics, but it is proper that we should\n\t\t\t\t\tapprehend the admirable adaptation of those hidden\n\t\t\t\t\tand concealed parts to the functions of procreation\n\t\t\t\t\tand bringing to birth. However, the production and\n\t\t\t\t\tadministering of milk is sufficient proof of Nature's\n\t\t\t\t\tforesight and care. For in women the amount of\n\t\t\t\t\tblood exceeds the use for it because of the sluggishness and paucity of their breath and, coming to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsurface, wanders at large and burdens them ; at other\n\t\t\t\t\ttimes it is Nature's custom and care to discharge the\n\t\t\t\t\tblood at monthly periods by opening canals and\n\t\t\t\t\tchannels for it, to lighten and cleanse the rest of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe body and in season to render the womb fertile\n\t\t\t\t\tground for ploughing, as it were, and sowing. But\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the womb receives the seed as it encounters it\n\t\t\t\t\tand enfolds it and it has taken root there ( as\n\t\t\t\t\tDemocritus says,  for the fruit now\n\t\t\t\t\tconceived that is to be), Nature shuts the monthly\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tcanals of purification and, taking the drifting blood,\n\t\t\t\t\tuses it for nourishment and irrigates the embryo,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich already is beginning to be formed and shaped,\n\t\t\t\t\tuntil, having been carried the number of months\n\t\t\t\t\tproper to its growth within the womb, it needs other\n\t\t\t\t\tnourishment and abiding-place. At that time, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tNature, more carefully than any gardener or irrigator,\n\t\t\t\t\tturns and changes the blood from one use to another\n\t\t\t\t\tand has in readiness subterranean springs, as it were,\n\t\t\t\t\tof a fresh-flowing stream ; and the springs receive\n\t\t\t\t\tthe blood in no perfunctory or unemotional manner,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut are even able, by the gentle heat and soft\n\t\t\t\t\twomanliness of respiration, to digest, mollify, and\n\t\t\t\t\tchange it; for such a disposition and temper does the\n\t\t\t\t\tbreast have within it. Yet there are no outflowing\n\t\t\t\t\tstreams of milk nor spouts which discharge it all\n\t\t\t\t\tat once, but the breast terminates in flesh that\n\t\t\t\t\tis full of springs and can filter the milk gently\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough minute passage-ways ; and it thus gives a\n\t\t\t\t\tstore of food that is comfortable for the infant's\n\t\t\t\t\tmouth and pleasant for it to touch and to grasp."}, {"quote": {"@rend": "blockquote", "l": [{"note": {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Il."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "infra"}], "#text": "Homer, , xvii. 446-447;  500 b, ."}, "#text": "There is nothing more wretched than a man,"}, "Of all that breathes and creeps upon the earth -"]}, "pb": {"@id": "v.6.p.349"}, "note": [{"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "But it is with reference to the dead Patroclus that Zeus speaks these lines."}, {"@resp": "ed", "@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cf.
