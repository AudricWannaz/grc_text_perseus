The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthird reason was, that it is peculiar to this place to be most\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconvenient for the despatch of any sudden business; for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoman consul is not such a one as Archias the governor\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Thebes, so as to say, when letters of importance are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought to him at dinner, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand then throw aside the packet and take the great\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbowl; but he will be careful, circumspect, and mind it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat that very instant.

Pericles, as often as he was chosen general, when he first put\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton his cloak, used to say to himself, as it were to refresh\n\t\t\t\t\t\this memory, Take heed, Pericles, thou dost govern freemen, thou dost govern Greeks, thou dost govern Athenians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo let our director say privately to himself, Thou art a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernor over friends, that he may remember to neither\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffer them to be debauched nor stint their mirth. Besides,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the ought to have some skill in the serious studies of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguests, and not be altogether ignorant of mirth and humor;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyet I would have him (as pleasant wine ought to be) a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle severe and rough, for the liquor will soften and smooth\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, and make his temper pleasant and agreeable. For as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tXenophon says, that Clearchus's rustic and morose humor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a battle, by reason of his bravery and heat, seemed pleasant and surprising; thus one that is not of a very sour nature, but grave and severe, being softened by a chirping cup,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecomes more pleasant and complaisant. But chiefly he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be acquainted with every one of the guests' humors, what alteration the liquor makes in him, what passion he is most subject to, and what quantity he can bear;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor it is not to be supposed the water bears various proportions to different sorts of wine (which kings' cup-bearers understanding sometimes pour in more, sometimes less),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that man hath no such relation to them. This our director ought to know, and knowing, punctually observe;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso that like a good musician, screwing up one and letting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown another, he may make between these different natures\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta pleasing harmony and agreement; so that he shall not proportion his wine by measure, but give every one what was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproper and agreeable, according to the present circumstances of time and strength of body. But if this is too\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult a task, yet it is necessary that a steward should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow the common accidents of age and nature, such as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese,that an old man will be sooner overtaken than a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyouth, one that leaps about or talks sooner than he that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis silent or sits still, the thoughtful and melancholy sooner\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan the cheerful and the brisk. And he that understands\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese things is much more able to preserve quietness and\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder, than one that is perfectly ignorant and unskilful.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBesides, I think none will doubt but that the steward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tought to be a friend, and have no pique at any of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguests; for otherwise in his injunctions he will be intolerable, in his distributions unequal, in his jests apt to scoff\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand give offence.

For he that laughs\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand is tickled at what Theocritus said to one whom he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuspected of a design upon his purse, and who asked him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif he went to supper at such a place,Yes, he replied, I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgo, but shall likewise lodge there all night,doth, as it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere confirm the accusation, and believe the fellow was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthief.

That being over, Glaucias and Xenocles drew various reasons from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe autumnal fruit. One said, that it scoured the body,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand by this evacuation continually raised new appetites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXenocles affirmed, that ripe fruit had usually a pleasing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvellicating sapor, and thereby provoked the appetite better\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan sauces or sweetmeats; for sick men of a vitiated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstomach usually recover it by eating fruit. But Lamprias\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid, that our natural heat, the principal instrument of nutrition, in the midst of summer is scattered and becomes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trare and weak, but in autumn it unites again and gathers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength, being shut in by the ambient cold and contraction\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the pores.

But Alexander deriding the question as slight and impertinent, my relation\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFirmus said: Well, sir, at present your atoms will do me\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome service; for if we suppose that small things must be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe principles of greater, it is likely that the egg was before the bird; for an egg amongst sensible things is very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsimple, and the bird is more mixed, and contains a greater\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvariety of parts. It is universally true, that a principle is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore that whose principle it is; now the seed is a principle, and the egg is somewhat more than the seed, and less\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan the bird; for as a disposition or a progress in goodness is something between a tractable mind and a habit of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvirtue, so an egg is as it were a progress of Nature tending\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the seed to a perfect animal. And as in an animal they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsay the veins and arteries are formed first, upon the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount the egg should be before the bird, as the thing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontaining before the thing contained. Thus art first\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmakes rude and ill-shapen figures, and afterwards perfects\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevery thing with its proper form; and it was for this\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason that the statuary Polycletus said, Then our work is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost difficult, when the clay comes to be fashioned by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnail. So it is probable that matter, not readily obeying the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslow motions of contriving Nature, at first frames rude and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindefinite masses, as the egg, and of these moulded anew,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand joined in better order, the animal afterward is formed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs the canker is first, and then growing dry and cleaving\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlets forth a winged animal, called psyche; so the egg is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst as it were the subject matter of the generation. For\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit is certain that, in every change, that out of which the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthing changes must be before the thing changing. Observe how worms and caterpillars are bred in trees from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe moisture corrupted or concocted; now none can say\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut that the engendering moisture is naturally before all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese. For (as Plato says) matter is as a mother or nurse\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin respect of the bodies that are formed, and we call that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatter out of which any thing that is is made. And with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta smile continued he, I speak to those that are acquainted\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the mystical and sacred discourse of Orpheus, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot only affirms the egg to be before the bird, but makes it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first being in the whole world. The other parts, because deep mysteries (as Herodotus would say), we shall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow pass by; but let us look upon the various kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanimals, and we shall find almost every one beginning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom an egg,fowls and fishes; land animals, as lizards;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamphibious, as crocodiles; some with two legs, as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcock; some without any, as a snake; and some with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany, as a locust. And therefore in the solemnly feast of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBacchus it is very well done to dedicate an egg, as the\n\t\t\t\t\t\temblem of that which begets and contains every thing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin itself."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "3", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v.3.p.245"}, {"@id": "v.3.p.246"}], "#text": "To this discourse of Firmus, Senecio replied: Sir,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour last similitude contradicts your first, and you have unwittingly opened the world (instead of the door, as the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying is) against yourself. For the world was before all,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing the most perfect; and it is rational that the perfect\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Nature should be before the imperfect, as the sound before the maimed, and the whole before the part. For it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabsurd that there should be a part when there is nothing\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhose part it is; and therefore nobody says the seed's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tman or egg's hen, but the man's seed and hen's egg; because those being after these and formed in them, pay as it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere a debt to Nature, by bringing forth another. For\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey are not in themselves perfect, and therefore have a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnatural appetite to produce such a thing as that out of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich they were first formed; and therefore seed is defined as a telling produced that is to be perfected by another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduction. Now nothing can be perfected by or want\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat which as yet is not. Everybody sees that eggs have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe nature of a concretion or consistence in some animal or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother, but want those organs, veins, and muscles which animals enjoy. Therefore no story delivers that ever any egg\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas formed immediately from earth; and the poets themselves tell us, that the egg out of which came the Tyndaridae\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfell down from heaven. But even till this time the earth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduceth some perfect and organized animals, as mice in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEgypt, and snakes, frogs, and grasshoppers almost everywhere, some external and invigorating principle assisting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the production. And in Sicily, where in the servile war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch blood was shed, and many carcasses rotted on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tground, whole swarms of locusts were produced, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspoiled the corn over the whole isle. Such spring from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand are nourished by the earth; and seed being formed in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, pleasure and titillation provoke them to mix, upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich some lay eggs, and some bring forth their young\n\t\t\t\t\t\talive; and this evidently proves that animals first sprang\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom earth, and afterwards by copulation, after different\n\t\t\t\t\t\tways, propagated their several kinds. In short, it is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame thing as if you said the womb was before the woman;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor as the womb is to the egg, the egg is to the chick that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis formed in it; so that he that inquires how birds should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe when there were no eggs, might ask as well how men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand women could be before any organs of generation were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformed. Parts generally have their subsistence together\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the whole; particular powers follow particular members, and operations follow those powers, and effects those\n\t\t\t\t\t\toperations. Now the effect of the generative power is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseed and egg; so that these must be after the formation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe whole. Therefore consider, as there can be no digestion of food before the animal is formed, so there can be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno seed nor egg; for those, it is likely, are made by some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdigestion and alterations; nor can it be that, before the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanimal is, the superfluous parts of the food of the animal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould have a being. Besides, though seed may perhaps\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretend to be a principle, the egg cannot; for it doth not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubsist first, nor hath it the nature of a whole, for it is imperfect. Therefore we do not affirm that the animal is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduced without a principle of its being; but we call the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprinciple that power which changes, mixes, and tempers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe matter, so that a living creature is regularly produced;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut the egg is an after-production, as the blood or milk of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan animal after the taking in and digestion of the food.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor we never see an egg formed immediately of mud, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit is produced in the bodies of animals alone; but a thousand living creatures rise from the mud. What need of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany instances? None ever found the spawn or egg of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan eel; yet if you empty a pit and take out all the mud,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas soon as other water settles in it, eels likewise are presently produced. Now that must exist first which hath no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneed of any other thing that it may exist, and that after,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich cannot be without the concurrence of another thing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd of this priority is our present discourse. Besides,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbirds build nests before they lay their eggs; and women\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovide cradles, swaddling-clothes, and the like; yet who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsays that the nest is before the egg, or the swaddling-clothes before the infant? For the earth (as Plato says)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoth not imitate a woman, but a woman, and so likewise\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall other females, the earth. Moreover it is probable that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first production out of the earth, which was then vigorous and perfect, was self-sufficient and entire, nor stood\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin need of those secundines, membranes, and vessels, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow Nature forms to help the weakness and supply the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefects of breeders."}}]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "4", "head": {"lb": [null, null], "#text": "Question IV.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t WHETHER OR NO WRESTLING IS THE OLDEST EXERCISE.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t SOSICLES, LYSIMACHUS, PLUTARCH, PHILINUS."}, "div3": {"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v.3.p.247"}, {"@id": "v.3.p.248"}], "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pa/lh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "phlo/s"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pa/lh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pale/uein"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "palaisth/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pugmh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pa/lh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pugmh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "palu/nein"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "katapa/ssein"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "sumpa/ssein"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pa/lh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pa/lh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "plhsia/zein"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pe/las gi/gnesqai"}], "#text": "SOSICLES of Coronea having at the Pythian games won\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe prize from all the poets, we gave him an entertainment.

Lysimachus, one of the company, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprocurator of the Amphictyons, said he heard a grammarian lately affirm that wrestling was the most ancient\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texercise of all, as even the very name witnessed; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome modern things have the names of more ancient\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttransferred to them; thus tuning a pipe is called fitting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit, and playing on it is called striking; both these being\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttransferred to it from the harp. Thus all places of exercise they call wrestling schools, wrestling being the oldest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texercise, and therefore denominating the newer sorts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat, said I, is no good argument, for these palaestras or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twrestling schools are called so from wrestling (), not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause it is the most ancient exercise, but because it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe only sort in which they use clay (), dust, and oil;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor in these there is neither racing nor cuffing, but wrestling only, and that part of the pancratium in which they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstruggle on the ground,for the pancratium comprises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tboth wrestling and cuffing. Besides, it is unlikely that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twrestling, being more artificial and methodical than any\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother sort of exercise, should likewise be the most ancient;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor mere want or necessity, putting us upon new inventions, produces simple and inartificial things first, and such\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas have more of force in them than sleight and skill. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tended, Sosicles said: You speak right, and I will confirm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyour discourse from the very name; for, in my opinion,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, wrestling, is derived from , i. e. to throw down\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby sleight and artifice. And Philinus said, it seems to me\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be derived from , the palm of the hand, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twrestlers use that part most, as cuffers do the , fist;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand hence both these sorts of exercises have their proper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnames, the one , the other . Besides, since the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpoets use the word  for  and , to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsprinkle, and this action is most frequent amongst wrestlers, this exercise  may receive its name from that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tword. But more, consider that racers strive to be distant\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom one another; cuffers, by the judges of the field, are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot permitted to take hold; and none but wrestlers come\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tup close breast to breast, and clasp one another round the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twaist, and most of their turnings, liftings, lockings, bring\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem very close.

Our relation Patroclias seemed to be pretty happy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin his reasoning upon the first part, saying, that the beast\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby biting it did mollify the flesh; for wolves' spirits are so\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thot and fiery, that they soften and digest the hardest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbones; and for the same reason things bitten by wolves\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trot sooner than others. But concerning the wool we could\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot agree, being not fully resolved whether it breeds those\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlice, or only opens a passage for them, separating the flesh\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby its fretting roughness or proper warmth; and it seemed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat this power proceeded from the bite of the wolf, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talters even the very hair of the creature that it kills. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis some particular instances seem to confirm; for we\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tknow some huntsmen and cooks will kill a beast with one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstroke, so that it never breathes after, whilst others repeat\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir blows, and scarce do it with a great deal of trouble.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut (what is more strange) some, as they kill it, infuse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch a quality that the flesh rots presently and cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkept sweet above a day; yet others that despatch it as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsoon find no such alteration, but the flesh will keep sweet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta long while. And that by the manner of killing a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talteration is made even in the skins, nails, and hair of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeast, Homer seems to witness, when, speaking of a good\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thide, he says,"}, "for those that fell not by a disease or old age, but by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tviolent death, leave us tough and strong hides; but when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey are bitten by wild beasts, their hoofs grow black, their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thair falls, their skins putrefy and are good for nothing."]}}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "10", "head": {"lb": [null, null], "#text": "Question X.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t WHETHER THE ANCIENTS, WHO PROVIDED EVERY ONE HIS MESS, DID BETTER THAN WE, WHO SET MANY TO THE SAME DISH.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t PLUTARCH, HAGIAS."}, "div3": [{"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "p": [{"pb": [{"@id": "v.3.p.256"}, {"@id": "v.3.p.257"}], "quote": {"@rend": "blockquote", "#text": "Where heroes mixed sat round the noble board,"}, "#text": "WHEN I was chief magistrate, most of the suppers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsisted of distinct messes, where every particular guest\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad his portion of the sacrifice allowed him.

So,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the same cup is set in the midst, not appropriated to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany, it is a large spring of good fellowship, and each man\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmay take as much as his appetite requires; not like this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost unjust distribution of bread and meat, which prides\n\t\t\t\t\t\titself forsooth in being equal to all, though unequal,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstomachs; for the same portion to a man of a small appetite is too much; to one of a greater, too little. And, sir, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\the that administers the very same dose of physic to all sorts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof patients must be very ridiculous; so likewise must that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentertainer who, inviting a great many guests that can\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneither eat nor drink alike, sets before every one an equal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmess, and measures what is just and fit by an arithmetical\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot geometrical proportion. When we go to a shop to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuy, we all use, it is true, one and the same public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasure; but to an entertainment each man brings his\n\t\t\t\t\t\town belly, which is satisfied with a portion, not because it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis equal to that which others have, but because it is sufficient for\n\t\t\t\t\t\titself. Those entertainments where every one\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad his single mess Homer mentions amongst soldiers and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the camp, which we ought not to bring into fashion\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamongst us; but we should rather imitate the good friendship of the ancients, who, to show what reverence they\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad for all kinds of societies, not only honored those that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlived with them or under the same roof, but also those that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrank out of the same cup or ate out of  same dish.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLet us never mind Homer's entertainments; they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood for nothing but to starve a man, and the makers of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem were kings, more stingy and observant than the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian cooks; insomuch that in the midst of a battle,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhilst they were at handy-blows with their enemies, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould exactly reckon up how many glasses each man drank\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat his table.

But when luxury crept into our feasts, distributing was thrown out; for I suppose they had not leisure to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdivide these numerous tarts, cheese-cakes, pies, and other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdelicate varieties; but, surprised with the pleasantness of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe taste and tired with the variety, they left off cutting it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinto portions, and left all in common. This is confirmed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the present practice; for in our religious or public\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfeasts, where the food is simple and inartificial, each man\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thath his mess assigned him; so that he that endeavors to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieve the ancient custom will likewise recover thrift\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand almost lost frugality again. But, you object, where\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly property is, community is lost. True indeed, where\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tequality is not; for not the possession of what is proper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand our own, but the taking away of another's and coveting that which is common, is the cause of all injury and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontention; and the laws, restraining and confining these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twithin the bounds of propriety, receive their name from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir office, being a power distributing equality to every\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone in order to the common good. Thus every one is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be honored by the entertainer with the garland or the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchiefest place; but if any one brings with him his sweet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\theart or a minstrel-wench, they must be common to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand his friends, that all things may be huddled together in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone mass, as Anaxagoras would have it.

And Bacchus was counted a physician not only for finding wine, the most pleasing and most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpotent remedy, but for bringing ivy, the greatest opposite\n\t\t\t\t\t\timaginable to wine, into reputation, and for teaching his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrunken followers to wear garlands of it, that by that means\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey might be secured against the violence of a debauch,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe heat of the liquor being remitted by the coldness of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ivy. Besides, the names of several plants sufficiently\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevidence the ancients' curiosity in this matter; for they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnamed the walnut-tree , because it sends forth a heavy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand drowsy () spirit, which affects their heads who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsleep beneath it; and the daffodil, , because it benumbs the nerves and causes a stupid narcotic heaviness\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the limbs; and therefore Sophocles calls it the ancient\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgarland flower of the great (that is, the earthy) Gods.

And indeed I could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmention a great many which have their names from their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproper virtues. But the care and experience of the ancients sufficiently appears in those of which they made\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir garlands when they designed to be merry and frolic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover a glass of wine; for wine, especially when it seizes on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe head, and strains the body just at the very spring and\n\t\t\t\t\t\torigin of the sense, disturbs the whole man.

Of this last nature are the violet and rose;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the odors of both these are prevalent against any ache\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand heaviness in the head. The flowers of privet and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrocus bring those that have drunk freely into a gentle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsleep; for they send forth a smooth and gentle effluvia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich softly takes off all asperities that arise in the body\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the drunken; and so all things being quiet and composed, the violence of the noxious humor is abated and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrown off.

And snow, that for many days will lie on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother trees, presently melts from the branches of the ivy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand wastes all around, as far as the warmth reaches. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe greatest evidence is this. Theophrastus tells us, that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen Alexander commanded Harpalus to plant some Grecian trees in the Babylonian gardens, andbecause the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclimate is very hot and the sun violentsuch as were leafy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthick, and fit to make a shade, the ivy only would not grow;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough all art and diligence possible was used, it withered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand died. For being hot itself, it could not agree with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfiery nature of the soil; for excess in similar qualities is destructive, and therefore we see every thing as it were affects\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits contrary; a cold plant flourishes in a hot ground, and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\thot plant is delighted with a cold. Upon which account\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit is that bleak mountains, exposed to cold winds and snow,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbear firs, pines, and the like, full of pitch, fiery, and excellent to make a torch. But besides, Trypho, trees of a cold\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnature, their little feeble heat not being able to diffuse\n\t\t\t\t\t\titself but retiring to the heart, shed their leaves; but their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnatural oiliness and warmth preserve the laurel, olive, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcypress always green; and the like too in the ivy may be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved. And therefore it is not likely our dear friend\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBacchus, who called wine  () and himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\t, should bring ivy into reputation for being a preservative against drunkenness and an enemy to wine. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin my opinion, as lovers of wine, when they have not any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjuice of the grape ready, drink ale, mead, cider, or the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike; thus he that in winter would have a vine-garland on\n\t\t\t\t\t\this head, finding the vine naked and without leaves, used\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ivy that is like it; for its boughs are twisted and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tirregular, its leaves moist and disorderly confused, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchiefly the berries, like ripening clusters, make an exact\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepresentation of the vine.

Ammonius too\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbade us not be afraid, for he would not reply to any of our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscourses; and Trypho likewise urging me to propose\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething, I said: To demonstrate that the ivy is cold is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot so proper a task for me as Trypho, for he often useth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoolers and binders; but that proposition, that wine in\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich ivy berries have been is more inebriating, is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrue; for that disturbance which it raiseth in those that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrink it is not so properly called drunkenness as alienation\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof mind or madness, such as hyoscyamus and a thousand\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother things that set men beside themselves usually produce. The crookedness of the bough is no argument at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall, for such violent and unnatural effects cannot be supposed to proceed from any natural quality or power. Now\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsticks are bent by the fire, because that draws the moisture, and so the crookedness is a violent distortion; but the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnatural heat nourishes and preserves the body. Consider\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, whether it is not the weakness and coldness of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe body that makes it wind, bend, and creep upon the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tground; for those qualities check its rise, and depress it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin its ascent, and render it like a weak traveller, that often\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsits down and then goes on again. Therefore the ivy\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequires something to twine about, and needs a prop;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor it is not able to sustain and direct its own branches,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause it wants heat, which naturally tends upward. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsnow is melted by the wetness of the leaf, for water destroys it easily, passing through the thin contexture, it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing nothing but a congeries of small bubbles; and therefore in very cold but moist places the snow melts as soon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas in hot. That it is continually green doth not proceed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom its heat, for to shed its leaves doth not argue the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoldness of a tree. Thus the myrtle and maiden-hair,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough not hot, but confessedly cold, are green all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear. Some imagine this comes from the equal and duly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproportioned mixture of the qualities in the leaf, to which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmpedocles hath added a certain aptness of pores, through\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich the nourishing juice is orderly transmitted, so that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is still supply sufficient. But now it is otherwise in\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrees whose leaves fall, by reason of the wideness of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher and narrowness of their lower pores; for the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo not send juice enough, nor do the former keep it, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpour it out as soon as a small stock is received. This may\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe illustrated from the usual watering of our gardens;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor when the distribution is unequal, the plants that are\n\t\t\t\t\t\talways watered have nourishment enough, seldom wither,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand look always green. But you further argue, that being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplanted in Babylon it would not grow. It was well done\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the plant, methinks, being a particular friend and familiar of the Boeotian God, to scorn to live amongst the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbarbarians, or imitate Alexander in following the manners\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof those nations; but it was not its heat but cold that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas the cause of this aversion, for that could not agree\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the contrary quality. For one similar quality doth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot destroy but cherish another. Thus dry ground bears\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthyme, though it is naturally hot. Now at Babylon they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsay the air is so suffocating, so intolerably hot, that many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the merchants sleep upon skins full of water, that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmay lie cool."}}]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "3", "head": {"lb": [null, null], "#text": "Question III.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t WHY WOMEN ARE HARDLY, OLD MEN EASILY, FOXED.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t FLORUS, SYLLA."}, "div3": {"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v.3.p.269"}, {"@id": "v.3.p.270"}], "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ge/rontes"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "r(e/ontes ei)s gh=n"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "gew/deis"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "gehroi/"}], "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "earthlike"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "earthy."}], "#text": "FLORUS thought it strange that Aristotle in his discourse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Drunkenness, affirming that old men are easily, women\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thardly, overtaken, did not assign the cause, since he seldom\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfailed on such occasions. He therefore proposed it to us\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(we were a great many acquaintance met at supper) as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfit subject for our enquiry. Sylla began: One part will\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconduce to the discovery of the other; and if we rightly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thit the cause in relation to the women, the difficulty, as it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerns the old men, will be easily despatched; for their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo natures are quite contrary. Moistness, smoothness,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand softness belong to the one; and dryness, roughness,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand hardness are the accidents of the other. As for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twomen, I think the principal cause is the moistness of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir temper; this produceth a softness in the flesh, a shining smoothness, and their usual purgations. Now when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twine is mixed with a great deal of weak liquor, it is overpowered by that, loses its strength, and becomes flat and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twaterish. Some reason likewise may be drawn from Aristotle himself; for he affirms that those that drink fast, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttake a large draught without drawing breath, are seldom\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tovertaken, because the wine doth not stay long in their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbodies, but having acquired an impetus by this greedy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrinking, suddenly runs through; and women are generally observed to drink after that manner. Besides, it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprobable that their bodies, by reason of the continual defluction of the moisture in order to their usual purgations,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare very porous, and divided as it were into many little pipes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand conduits; into which when the wine falls, it is quickly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconveyed away, and doth not lie and fret the principal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparts, from whose disturbance drunkenness proceeds. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat old men want the natural moisture, even the name\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, in my opinion, intimates; for that name was given\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem not as inclining to the earth (), but as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing in the habit of their body  and , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand  Besides, the stiffness and roughness prove\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe dryness of their nature. Therefore it is probable that,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen they drink, their body, being grown spongy by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdryness of its nature, soaks up the wine, and that lying in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe vessels it affects the senses and prevents the natural\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmotions. For as floods of water glide over the close\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrounds, nor make them slabby, but quickly sink into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\topen and chapped fields; thus wine, being sucked in by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe dry parts, lies and works in the bodies of old men.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut besides, it is easy to observe, that age of itself hath\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall the symptoms of drunkenness. These symptoms every\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbody knows; shaking of the joints, faltering of the tongue,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbabbling, passion, forgetfulness, and distraction of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmind; many of which being incident to old men, even\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhilst they are well and in perfect health, are heightened\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby any little irregularity and accidental debauch. So that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrunkenness doth not beget in old men any new and proper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsymptoms, but only intend and increase the common ones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd an evident sign of this is, that nothing is so like an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\told man as a young man drunk."}}}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "4", "head": {"lb": [null, null], "#text": "Question IV.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t WHETHER THE TEMPER OF WOMEN IS COLDER OR HOTTER THAN THAT OF MEN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t APOLLONIDES, ATHRYILATUS."}, "div3": [{"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "p": "THUS Sylla said, and Apollonides the marshal subjoined: Sir, what you discoursed of old men I willingly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadmit; but in my opinion you have omitted a considerable\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason in relation to the women, the coldness of their temper, which quencheth the heat of the strongest wine, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmakes it lose all its destructive force and fire.

And\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEpicurus, in his Banquet, hath a long discourse, the sum\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof which is that wine of itself is not hot, but that it contains some atoms that cause heat, and others that cause\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcold; now, when it is taken into the body, it loses one sort\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof particles and takes the other out of the body itself, according to the person's nature and constitution; so that some\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen they are drunk are very hot, and others very cold.", "pb": {"@id": "v.3.p.273"}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "2", "p": ["This way of talking, said Florus, leads us by Protagoras directly to Pyrrho; for it is evident that, suppose we\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere to discourse of oil, milk, honey, or the like, we shall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavoid all enquiry into their particular natures, by saying\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat things are so and so by their mutual mixture with one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother. But how do you prove that wine is cold? And I,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing forced to speak extempore, replied: By two arguments. The first I draw from the practice of physicians,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor when their patients' stomachs grow very weak, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprescribe no hot things, and yet give them wine as an excellent remedy.

Now if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit were potentially hot, I should think it as wise a thing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto apply fire to snow as wine to the stomach.", {"pb": {"@id": "v.3.p.274"}, "#text": "Again, most teach that sleep proceeds from the coolness\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the parts; and most of the narcotic medicines, as mandrake and opium, are coolers. Those indeed work violently, and forcibly condense, but wine cools by degrees;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit gently stops the motion, according as it hath more or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tless of such narcotic qualities. Besides, heat is generative; for owing to heat the moisture flows easily, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe vital spirit gains intensity and a stimulating force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow the great drinkers are very dull, inactive fellows, no\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twomen's men at all; they eject nothing strong, vigorous,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand fit for generation, but are weak and unperforming, by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treason of the bad digestion and coldness of their seed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd it is farther observable that the effects of cold and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrunkenness upon men's bodies are the same,trembling,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\theaviness, paleness, shivering, faltering of tongue, numbness, and cramps. In many, a debauch ends in a dead\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpalsy, when the wine stupefies and extinguisheth all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\theat. And the physicians use this method in curing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tqualms and diseases gotten by debauch; at night they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcover them well and keep them warm; and at day they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanoint and bathe, and give them such food as shall not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisturb, but by degrees recover the heat which the wine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thath scattered and driven out of the body. Thus, I\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadded, in these appearances we trace obscure qualities\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand powers; but as for drunkenness, it is easily discerned\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhat it is. For, in my opinion, as I hinted before, those\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat are drunk are very much like old men; and therefore\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat drinkers grow old soonest, and they are commonly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbald and gray before their time; and all these accidents\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcertainly proceed from want of heat. But mere vinegar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis of a vinous nature and strength, and nothing quenches\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfire so soon as that; its extreme coldness overcomes and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkills the flame presently. And of all fruits physicians use\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe vinous as the greatest coolers, as pomegranates and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapples. Besides, do they not make wine by mixing honey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith rain-water or snow; for the cold, because those two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tqualities are near akin, if it prevails, changes the luscious\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinto a poignant taste? And did not the ancients of all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcreeping beasts consecrate the snake to Bacchus, and of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall the plants the ivy, because they were of a cold and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrozen nature? Now, lest any one should think this is an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tevidence of its heat, that if a man drinks juice of hemlock, a large dose of wine cures him, I shall on the contrary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taffirm that wine and hemlock juice mixed are an incurable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpoison, and kill him that drinks it presently. So that we\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcan no more conclude it to be hot because it resists, than\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be cold because it assists, the poison.

They usually say, I think, that a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsober man's understanding apprehends things right and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjudges well; the sense of one quite drunk is weak and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenfeebled; but of them that are half drunk the fancy is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvigorous and the understanding weakened, and therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing their own fancies, they judge, but judge ill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut pray, sirs, what is your opinion in these matters?"}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "2", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "v.3.p.282"}, "#text": "This reason, I replied, would satisfy me upon a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate disquisition; but if you will have my own sentiments, let us first consider, whether this difference doth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot proceed from the different temper of the body. For\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof those that are only half drunk, the mind alone is disturbed, but the body not being quite overwhelmed is yet\n\t\t\t\t\t\table to obey its motions; but when it is too much oppressed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the wine has overpowered it, it betrays and frustrates\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe motions of the mind, for men in such a condition never\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgo so far as action. But those that are half drunk, having\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta body serviceable to the absurd motions of the mind, are\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather to be thought to have greater ability to comply with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose they have, than to have worse inclinations than the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers. Now if, proceeding on another principle, we consider the strength of the wine itself, nothing hinders but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat this may be different and changeable, according to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquantity that is drunk. As fire, when moderate, hardens\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta piece of clay, but if very strong, makes it brittle and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrumble into pieces; and the heat of the spring fires our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblood with fevers, but as the summer comes on. the disease\n\t\t\t\t\t\tusually abates; what hinders then but that the mind, being naturally raised by the power of the wine, when it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcome to a pitch, should by pouring on more be weakened\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagain, and its force abated? Thus hellebore, before it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurges, disturbs the body; but if too small a dose be given,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit disturbs only and purges not at all; and some taking too\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle of an opiate are more restless than before; and some\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaking too much sleep well. Besides, it is probable that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis disturbance into which those that are half drunk are put,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen it comes to a pitch, conduces to that decay. For a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquantity being taken inflames the body and consumes the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrenzy of the mind; as a mournful song and melancholy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmusic at a funeral raises grief at first and forces tears, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas it continues, by little and little it takes away all dismal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapprehensions and consumes our sorrows.

For heat is not different only by degrees; but in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfires there are some proper qualities very much unlike one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother, as a thousand obvious instances will prove. Goldsmiths heat their gold in chaff fires; physicians use fires\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof vine-twigs in their distillations; and tamarisk is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbest fuel for a glass-house.

Therefore it is no wonder\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the moon differs in her qualities from the sun; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the sun should shed some drying, and the moon some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdissolving, influence upon flesh. And upon this account\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit is that nurses are very cautious of exposing their infants\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the beams of the moon; for they being full of moisture,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas green plants, are easily wrested and distorted. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverybody knows that those that sleep abroad under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeams of the moon are not easily waked, but seem stupid\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand senseless; for the moisture that the moon sheds upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem oppresses their faculty and disables their bodies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBesides, it is commonly said, that women brought to bed\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the moon is a fortnight old, have easy labors; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor this reason I believe that Diana, which was the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the moon, was called the goddess of childbirth.

Secondly, no physician is so daring, so venturous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat new experiments, as to give a feverish patient different\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsorts of food at once. No, simple food, and without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsauce, as more easy to be digested, is the only diet they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallow. Now food must be wrought on and altered by our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnatural powers; in dyeing, cloth of the most simple color\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttakes the tincture soonest; the most inodorous oil is soonest by perfumes changed into an essence; and simple diet\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis soonest changed, and soonest yields to the digesting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower. For many and different qualities, having some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrariety, when they meet disagree and corrupt one another;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t as in a city, a mixed rout are not easily reduced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto one body, nor brought to follow the same concerns;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor each works according to its own nature, and is very\n\t\t\t\t\t\thardly brought to side with another's quality. Now this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis evident in wine; mixed wine inebriates very soon, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrunkenness is much like a crudity rising from undigested\n\t\t\t\t\t\twine; and therefore the drinkers hate mixed liquors, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose that do mix them do it privately, as afraid to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir design upon the company discovered. Every change\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis disturbing and injurious, and therefore musicians are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery careful how they strike many strings at once; though\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe mixture and variety of the notes would be the only\n\t\t\t\t\t\tharm that would follow. This I dare say, that belief and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassent can be sooner procured by disagreeing arguments,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan concoction by various and different qualities.

A\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglass of wine, when a man wants it, or a dish of palatable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeat, presently frees us from all disturbing particles, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsettles nature in its proper state, there being as it were a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalm and serenity spread over the troubled humors.

The second Homer skilfully refutes, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\the tells us that the plague first began amongst the beasts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBesides, the shortness of their lives proves that they are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvery subject to diseases; for there is scarce any irrational\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcreature long lived, besides the crow and the chough; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthose two every one knows do not confine themselves to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsimple food, but eat any thing. Besides, you take no good\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trule to judge what is easy and what is hard of digestion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the diet of those that are sick; for labor and exercise,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand even to chew our meat well, contribute very much to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdigestion, neither of which can agree with a man in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfever.

For if\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNature chooses from dissimilar bodies what is fit and agree\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\table, the diverse nourishment transmits many and sundry\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tqualities into the mass and bulk of the body, applying to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tevery part that which is meet and fit; so that, as Empedocles words it,"}, {"pb": {"@id": "v.3.p.295"}, "#text": "and after the mixture is spread through the mass by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\theat which is in the spirit, the proper parts are separated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand applied to the proper members.

But if by concoction\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is an alteration made in the food, this will be more\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teasily performed when there are different sorts of meat,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan when there is only one, in the stomach; for similars\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcannot work upon similars, and the very contrariety in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmixture considerably promotes the alteration of the enfeebled qualities. But if, Philinus, you are against all\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmixture, do not chide Philo only for the variety of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdishes and sauces, but also for using mixture in his sovereign antidotes, which Erasistratus calls the Gods' hands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConvince him of absurdity and vanity, when he mixes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthings vegetable, mineral, and animal, and things from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsea and land, in one potion; and advise him to let these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talone, and to confine all physic to barley-broth, gourds, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toil mixed with water. But you urge farther, that variety\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenticeth the appetite that hath no command over itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat is, good sir, cleanly, wholesome, sweet, palatable,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpleasing diet makes us eat and drink more than ordinary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhy then, instead of fine flour, do not we thicken our\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbroth with coarse bran? And instead of asparagus, why\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdo we not dress nettle-tops and thistles; and leaving this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfragrant and pleasant wine, drink sour harsh liquor that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgnats have been buzzing about a long while? Because,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperhaps you may reply, wholesome feeding doth not consist in a perfect avoiding of all that is pleasing, but in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoderating the appetite in that respect, and making it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprefer profit before pleasure. But, sir, as a mariner has a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthousand ways to avoid a stiff gale of wind, but when it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclear down and a perfect calm, cannot raise it again; thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto correct and restrain our extravagant appetite is no hard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmatter, but when it grows weak and faint, when it fails as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto its proper objects, then to raise it and make it vigorous\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand active again is, sir, a very difficult and hard task. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttherefore variety of viands is as much better than simple\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfood, which is apt to satisfy by being but of one sort, as it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis easier to stop Nature when she makes too much speed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan to force her on when languishing and faint. Beside,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhat some say, that fulness is more to be avoided than\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temptiness, is not true; but, on the contrary, fulness then\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly hurts when it ends in a surfeit or disease; but emptiness, though it doth no other mischief, is of itself unnatural. And let this suffice as an answer to what you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproposed. But you who stick to salt and cummin have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforgot, that variety is sweeter and more desired by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappetite, unless too sweet. For, the sight preparing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tway, it is soon assimilated to the eager receiving body; but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat which is not desirable Nature either throws off again,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor keeps it in for mere want. But pray observe this, that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI do not plead for variety in tarts, cakes, or sauces;those\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare vain, insignificant, and superfluous things;but even\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlato allowed variety to those fine citizens of his, setting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore them onions, olives, leeks, cheese, and all sorts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof meat and fish, and besides these, allowed them some\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdried fruits."}], "pb": {"@id": "v.3.p.294"}}]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "2", "head": {"lb": [null, null], "#text": "Question II.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t WHY MUSHROOMS ARE THOUGHT TO BE PRODUCED BY THUNDER, AND WHY IT IS BELIEVED THAT MEN ASLEEP ARE NEVER THUNDERSTRUCK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t AGEMACHUS, PLUTARCH, DOROTHEUS."}, "div3": [{"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "v.3.p.296"}, "#text": "AT a supper in Elis, Agemachus set before us very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge mushrooms.

And I, though I knew I should get no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat credit by proposing a cause whose reason was common to other things, said thus: Lightning is wonderfully\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpiercing and subtile, partly because it rises from a very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpure substance, and partly because by the swiftness of its\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmotion it purges itself and throws off all gross earthy particles that are mixed with it. Nothing, says Democritus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis blasted with lightning, that cannot resist and stop the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmotion of the pure flame. Thus the close bodies, as brass,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsilver, and the like, which stop it, feel its force and are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmelted, because they resist; whilst rare, thin bodies, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch as are full of pores, are passed through and not hurted,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas clothes or dry wood. It blasts green wood or grass, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoisture within them being seized and kindled by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflame. Now, if it is true that men asleep are never killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby lightning, from what we have proposed, and not from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany thing else, we must endeavor to draw the cause. Now\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bodies of those that are awake are stiffer and more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapt to resist, all the parts being full of spirits; which as it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere in a harp, distending and screwing up the organs of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsense, makes the body of the animal firm, close, and compacted. But when men are asleep, the organs are let\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown, and the body becomes rare, lax, and loose; and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspirits failing, it hath abundance of pores, through which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall sounds and smells do flow insensibly. For in that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase, there is nothing that can resist, and by this resistance\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceive any sensible impression from any objects that are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresented, much less from such as are so subtile and move\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso swiftly as lightning. Things that are weak Nature\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshields from harm, fencing them about with some hard\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthick covering; but those things that cannot be resisted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo less harm to the bodies that yield than to those that\n\t\t\t\t\t\toppose their force. Besides, those that are asleep are not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstartled at the thunder; they have no consternation upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, which kills a great many that are no otherwise hurt,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand we know that thousands die with the very fear of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing killed. Even shepherds teach their sheep to run\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether into a flock when it thunders, for whilst they lie\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscattered they die with fear; and we see thousands fall,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich have no marks of any stroke or fire about them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir souls (as it seems), like birds, flying out of their bodies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the fright.

For if that may truly be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid to be a dainty which gives meat the best relish, it will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevidently follow, that that is the best sort of dainty which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgets men the best stomach to their meat. Therefore, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose philosophers who were called Elpistics (from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGreek word signifying hope, which above all others they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcried up) averred that there was nothing in the world\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich concurred more to the preservation of life than\n\t\t\t\t\t\thope, without whose gracious influence life would be a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburden and altogether intolerable; in the like manner\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat of all things may be said to get us a stomach to our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeat, without which all meat would be unpalatable and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnauseous. And among all those things the earth yields,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe find no such things as salt, which we can have only\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the sea. First of all, there would be nothing eatable\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout salt, which mixed with flour seasons bread also.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHence it was that Neptune and Ceres had both the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttemple. Besides, salt is the most pleasant of all relishes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor those heroes who, like champions, used themselves to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta spare diet, banishing from their tables all vain and superfluous delicacies, to such a degree that when they encamped by the Hellespont they abstained from fish, yet for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall this could not eat flesh without salt; which is a sufficient evidence that salt is the most desirable of all relishes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor as colors need light, so tastes need salt, that they may\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffect the sense, unless you would have them very nauseous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand unpleasant. For, as Heraclitus used to say, a carcass\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis more abominable than dung. Now all flesh is dead, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart of a lifeless carcass; but the virtue of salt, being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadded to it, like a soul, gives it a pleasing relish and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoignancy. Hence it comes to pass that before meat men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuse to take sharp things, and such as have much salt in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem; for these beguile us into an appetite. And whoever has his stomach sharpened with these sets cheerfully\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand freshly upon all other sorts of meat.

For the field-mouse\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly for its blindness was worshipped as a God among the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEgyptians, because they were of an opinion that darkness\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas before light, and that the latter had its birth from mice\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout the fifth generation at the new moon; and moreover\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the liver of this creature diminishes in the wane of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe moon. But they consecrate the lion to the sun, because the lioness alone, of all clawed quadrupeds, brings\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforth her young with their eyesight; for they sleep a moment, and when they are asleep their eyes sparkle. Besides, they place gaping lions' heads for the spouts of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfountains, because Nilus overflows the Egyptian fields\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the sign is Leo: they give it out that their bird ibis,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas soon as hatched, weighs two drachms, which are of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame weight with the heart of a new-born infant; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat its legs being spread with the bill make an exact\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequilateral triangle. And yet who can find fault with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEgyptians for these trifles, when it is left upon record that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Pythagoreans worshipped a white cock, and of sea\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreatures abstained especially from the mullet and urtic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Magi that descended from Zoroaster adored the land\n\t\t\t\t\t\thedgehog above other creatures, but had a deadly spite\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst water-rats, and thought that man was dear in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\teyes of the Gods who destroyed most of them. But I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould think that if the Jews had such an antipathy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst a hog, they would kill it as the magicians do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmice; when, on the contrary, they are by their religion as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch prohibited to kill as to eat it.

Within a few days after they celebrate another feast, not darkly but openly, dedicated to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBacchus, for they have a feast amongst them called Kradephoria, from carrying palm-trees, and Thyrsophoria, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey enter into the temple carrying thyrsi. What they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo within I know not; but it is very probable that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperform the rites of Bacchus. First they have little trumpets, such as the Grecians used to have at their Bacchanalia to call upon their Gods withal. Others go before\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem playing upon harps, which they call Levites, whether\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso named from Lusius or Evius,either word agrees with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBacchus. And I suppose that their Sabbaths have some\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelation to Bacchus; for even at this day many call the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBacchi by the name of Sabbi, and they make use of that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tword at the celebration of Bacchus's orgies. And this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmay be made appear out of Demosthenes and Menander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNor would it be absurd, were any one to say that the name\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSabbath was imposed upon this feast from the agitation\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand excitement () which the priests of Bacchus indulged in. The Jews themselves testify no less; for when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey keep the Sabbath, they invite one another to drink till\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey are drunk; or if they chance to be hindered by some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore weighty business, it is the fashion at least to taste the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twine. Some perhaps may surmise that these are mere\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconjectures. But there are other arguments which will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclearly evince the truth of what I assert. The first may\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe drawn from their High-priest, who on holidays enters\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir temple with his mitre on, arrayed in a skin of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\thind embroidered with gold, wearing buskins, and a coat\n\t\t\t\t\t\thanging down to his ankles; besides, he has a great many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle bells hanging at his garment which make a noise\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas he walks the streets. So in the nightly ceremonies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Bacchus (as the fashion is amongst us), they make\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuse of musical instruments, and call the God's nurses\n\t\t\t\t\t\t. High up on the wall of their temple is a representation of the thyrsus and timbrels, which surely can\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelong to no other God than Bacchus. Moreover they are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforbidden the use of honey in their sacrifices, because they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuppose that a mixture of honey corrupts and deads the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twine. And honey was used for sacrificing in former days,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand with it the ancients were wont to make themselves\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrunk, before the vine was known. And at this day barbarous people who want wine drink metheglin, allaying\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sweetness of the honey by bitter roots, much of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaste of our wine. The Greeks offered to their Gods these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsober offerings or honey-offerings, as they called them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause that honey was of a nature quite contrary to wine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut this is no inconsiderable argument that Bacchus was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworshipped by the Jews, in that, amongst other kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpunishment, that was most remarkably odious by which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmalefactors were forbid the use of wine for so long a time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas the judge was pleased to prescribe.

For they said, he that only represents excels him that really feels, inasmuch as he doth not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffer the misfortunes; which we knowing are pleased and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelighted on that account."}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "2", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v.3.p.315"}, {"@id": "v.3.p.316"}], "#text": "But I, though it was not properly my talent, said that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe, being by nature rational and lovers of ingenuity, are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdelighted with and admire every thing that is artificially\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ingeniously contrived. For as a bee, naturally loving\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsweet things, seeks after and flies to any thing that has any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmixture of honey in it; so man, naturally loving ingenuity and elegancy, is very much inclined to embrace and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thighly approve every word or action that is seasoned with\n\t\t\t\t\t\twit and judgment. Thus, if any one offers a child a piece\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof bread, and at the same time a little dog or ox made in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaste, we shall see the boy run eagerly to the latter; so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikewise if any one offers him silver in the lump, and another a beast or a cup of the same metal, he will rather\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchoose that in which he sees a mixture of art and reason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUpon the same account it is that children are much in love\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith riddles, and such fooleries as are difficult and intricate; for whatever is curious and subtle doth attract and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallure human nature, as antecedently to all instruction\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagreeable and proper to it. And therefore, because he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat is really affected with grief or anger presents us with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing but the common bare passion, but in the imitation\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome dexterity and persuasiveness appears, we are naturally inclined to be disturbed at the former, whilst the latter delights us. It is unpleasant to see a sick man, or one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat is at his last gasp; yet with content we can look upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe picture of Philoctetes, or the statue of Jocasta, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhose face it is commonly said that the workmen mixed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsilver, so that the brass might represent the face and color\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof one ready to faint and yield up the ghost. And this,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid I, the Cyrenaics may use as a strong argument against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou Epicureans, that all the sense of pleasure which arises\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the working of any object on the ear or eye is not in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose organs, but in the intellect itself. Thus the continual cackling of a hen or cawing of a crow is very ungrateful and disturbing; yet he that imitates those noises well\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpleases the hearers. Thus to behold a consumptive man\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis no delightful spectacle; yet with pleasure we can view\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pictures and statues of such persons, because the very\n\t\t\t\t\t\timitating hath something in it very agreeable to the mind,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich allures and captivates its faculties. For upon what\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount, for God's sake, from what external impression\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon our organ, should men be moved to admire Parmeno's sow so much as to pass it into a proverb? Yet it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\treported, that Parmeno being very famous for imitating the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrunting of a pig, some endeavored to rival and outdo\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim. And when the hearers, being prejudiced, cried out,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVery well indeed, but nothing comparable to Parmeno's sow;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone took a pig under his arm and came upon the stage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd when, though they heard the very pig, they still continued, This is nothing comparable to Parmeno's sow; he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrew his pig amongst them, to show that they judged according to opinion and not truth. And hence it is very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevident, that like motions of the sense do not always raise\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike affections in the mind, when there is not an opinion\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the thing done was not neatly and ingeniously performed."}}]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "2", "head": {"lb": null, "#text": "Question II.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t THAT THE PRIZE FOR POETS AT THE GAMES WAS ANCIENT."}, "div3": {"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v.3.p.317"}, {"@id": "v.3.p.318"}], "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "r(h/mones"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "r() h(/mones"}], "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "orators,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "darters,"}], "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Il.

Which indeed made no unpleasant variety,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand increased the company, but yet impaired the gravity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand neatness of the solemnity. Besides it must create a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat deal of trouble to the umpires, and considerable dissatisfaction\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t to very many, since but few could obtain the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprize. It was chiefly agreed upon, that the orators and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpoets should be removed; and this determination did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproceed from any hatred to learning, but forasmuch as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch contenders are the most noted and worthiest men of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall, therefore they reverenced them, and were troubled that,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen they must judge every one deserving, they could not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbestow the prize equally upon all. I, being present at this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsult, dissuaded those who were for removing things from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir present settled order, and who thought this variety\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas unsuitable to the solemnity as many strings and many\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnotes to an instrument. And when at supper, Petraeus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe president and director of the sports entertaining us,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same subject was discoursed on, I defended music, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaintained that poetry was no upstart intruder, but that it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas time out of mind admitted into the sacred games, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcrowns were given to the best performer. Some straight\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\timagined that I intended to produce some old musty stories,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlike the funeral solemnities of Oeolycus the Thessalian or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Amphidamas the Chalcidean, in which they say Homer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand Hesiod contended for the prize. But passing by these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinstances as the common theme of every grammarian, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlikewise their criticisms who, in the description of Patroclus's obsequies in Homer, read ,  and not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, \n                      as if Achilles had proposed a prize for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe best speaker,omitting all these, I said that Acastus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat his father Pelias's funeral set a prize for contending\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpoets, and Sibylla won it. At this, a great many demanding some authority for this unlikely and incredible relation,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI happily recollecting myself produced Acesander, who in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\this description of Africa hath this relation; but I must\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconfess this is no common book.

For the Pythian, it is true, hath\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad three or four musical prizes added; but all the exercises of the body were for the most part the same from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning. But in the Olympian all beside racing are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlate additions. They instituted some, and abolished them\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagain; such were the races of mules, either rode or in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchariot, as likewise the crown appointed for boys that were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvictorious in the five contests. And, in short, a thousand\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthings in those games are mere novelties.

We were then at supper in Corinth,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the time of the Isthmian games, with Lucanius the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchief priest. Praxiteles the commentator brought this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfable for a reason; it is said that the body of Melicertes\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas found fixed to a pine-tree by the sea; and not far\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Megara, there is a place called the Race of a Fair\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLady, through which the Megarians say that Ino, with her\n\t\t\t\t\t\tson Melicertes in her arms, ran to the sea. And when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany advanced the common opinion, that the pine-tree\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgarland peculiarly belongs to Neptune, and Lucanius added\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it is sacred to Bacchus too, but yet, for all that, it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight also be appropriated to the honor of Melicertes, this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbegan the question, why the ancients dedicated the pine to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNeptune and Bacchus. As for my part, it did not seem\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincongruous to me, for both the Gods seem to preside over\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe moist and generative principle; and almost all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGreeks sacrifice to Neptune the nourisher of plants, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Bacchus the preserver of trees. Beside, it may be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid that the pine peculiarly agrees to Neptune, not, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApollodorus thinks, because it grows by the sea-side, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause it loves a bleak place (for some give this reason),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut because it is used in building ships; for the pine\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether with the like trees, as fir and cypress, affords the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbest and the lightest timber, and likewise pitch and rosin,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout which the compacted planks would be altogether\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunserviceable at sea. To Bacchus they dedicate the pine,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause it gives a pleasant seasoning to wine, for amongst\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpines they say the sweetest and most delicious grapes grow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe cause of this Theophrastus thinks to be the heat of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe soil; for pines grow most in chalky grounds. Now\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchalk is hot, and therefore must very much conduce to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcoction of the wine; as a chalky spring affords the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlightest and sweetest water; and if chalk is mixed with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorn, by its heat it makes the grains swell, and considerably\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases the heap. Besides, it is probable that the vine\n\t\t\t\t\t\titself is bettered by the pine, for that contains several things\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich are good to preserve wine. All cover the insides of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twine-casks with pitch, and many mix rosin with wine, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Euboeans in Greece, and in Italy those that live about\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe river Po. From the parts of Gaul about Vienna\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is a sort of pitched wine brought, which the Romans\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue very much; for such things mixed with it do not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly give it a good flavor, but make the wine generous,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaking away by their gentle heat all the crude, watery, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundigested particles."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "2", "p": [{"quote": {"@rend": "blockquote", "lg": {"l": ["The Isthmian garland I will sell as cheap", "As common wreaths of parsley may be sold."]}}, "#text": "When I had said thus much, a rhetorician in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompany, a man well read in all sorts of polite learning,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcried out: Good Gods! was it not but the other day that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Isthmian garland began to be made of pine?

Consider the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttimorous, they are afraid even of those things that preserve them. Consider the pettish, they are angry with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir best and dearest friends. Consider the amorous and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlascivious, in the height of their fury they dare violate a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVestal. For custom is very powerful to draw the temper\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the body to any thing that is suitable to it; and he that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis apt to fall will stumble at every thing that lies in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway.

For as a sphere must necessarily move spherically, and a cylinder cylindrically,\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to the difference of their figures; thus his dis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposition makes an envious man move enviously to all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings; and it is likely they should chiefly hurt their most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamiliar acquaintance and best beloved. And that fine fellow Eutelidas you mentioned, and the rest that are said to\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverlook themselves, may be easily and upon good rational\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrounds accounted for; for, according to Hippocrates. a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood habit of body, when at height, is easily perverted,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand bodies come to their full maturity do not stand at a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstay there, but fall and waste down to the contrary extreme.

For the assertion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcarries in it a repugnancy to the standing rules of reason;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforasmuch as the decayed stock of dry nourishment seems\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore naturally to call for its proper supplies. Whereupon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI told the company, that of those things whereof our bodies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare composed, heat onlyor, however, above all the rest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstands in continual need of such accessions; for the truth\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof which this may be urged as a convincing argument:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tneither air, water, nor earth requires any matter to feed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tupon, or devours whatsoever lies next it; but fire alone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdoth. Hence it comes to pass that young men, by reason\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof their greater share of natural heat, have commonly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgreater stomachs than old men; whereas on the contrary,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\told men can endure fasting much better, for this only\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treason, because their natural heat is grown weaker and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdecayed. Just so we see it fares with bloodless animals,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich by reason of the want of heat require very little\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnourishment. Besides, every one of us finds by experience, that bodily exercises, clamors, and whatever other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tactions by violent motion occasion heat, commonly sharpen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tour stomachs and get us a better appetite. Now, as I take\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit, the most natural and principal nourishment of heat is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoisture, as it evidently appears from flames, which increase by the pouring in of oil, and from ashes, which are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the driest things in nature; for after the humidity is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumed by the fire, the terrene and grosser parts remain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twithout any moisture at all. Add to these, that fire separates and dissolves bodies by extracting that moisture\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich should keep them close and compact. Therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen we are fasting, the heat first of all forces the moisture out of the relics of the nourishment that remain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the body, and then, pursuing the other humid parts,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpreys upon the natural moisture of the flesh itself.

For that makes it desire a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupply of what they stand in need of, and avoid a defect of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir proper food. Now to deny that this very thing, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprincipally distinguishes an animate creature from an inanimate, conduces to the preservation and duration of such a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreature, being that which craves and receives those things\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich the body needs to supply its wants, and, on the contrary, to suppose that such an appetite arises from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransfiguration or the greater or lesser size of the pores,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis an absurdity worthy only of such as have no regard at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall for Nature.

Moreover, these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneeds and supplies in relation to animals have some resemblance to those we see in husbandry. There are a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany like qualities and like provisions on both sides. For\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a drought we water our grounds, and in case of excessive heat, we frequently make use of moderate coolers;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand when our fruits are too cold, we endeavor to preserve\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand cherish them, by covering and making fences about\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. And for such things as are out of the reach of\n\t\t\t\t\t\thuman power, we implore the assistance of the Gods, that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis, to send us softening dews, sunshines qualified with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoderate winds; that so Nature, being always desirous of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta due mixture, may have her wants supplied.

And\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the first, I suppose that those meats that are palatable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand of a quick and sharp taste do not beget in us an appetite, but rather bite and fret those parts that receive the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnourishment, as we find that scratching the skin causes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\titching. And supposing we should grant that this affection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor disposition is the very thing which we call the appetite,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit is probable that, by the operation of such kind of food\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas this, the nourishment may be made small, and so much\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof it as is convenient for Nature severed from the rest, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the indigency proceeds not from the transmutation,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut front the evacuation and purgation of the passages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor sharp, tart, and salt things grate the inward matter,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand by dispersing of it cause digestion, so that by the concoctions of the old there may arise an appetite for new.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNor does the cessation of thirst after a bath spring from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe different position of the passages, but from a new supply of moisture received into the flesh, and conveyed from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthence to them also. And vomiting, by throwing off whatever is disagreeable to Nature, puts her in a capacity of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenjoying what is most suitable for her. For thirst does\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot call for a superfluity of moisture, but only for so much\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas sufficeth Nature; and therefore, though a man had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplenty of disagreeable and unnatural moisture, yet he wants\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstill, for that stops the course of the natural, which Nature\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis desirous of, and hinders a due mixture and temperament,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttill it be cast out and the passages receive what is most\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproper and convenient for them. Moreover, a fever forces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall the moisture downward; and the middle parts being\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a flame, it all retires thither, and there is shut up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand forcibly detained. And therefore it is usual with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat many to vomit, by reason of the density of the inward parts squeezing out the moisture, and likewise to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthirst, by reason of the poor and dry state the rest of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbody is in. But after the violence of the distemper is once\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabated, and the raging heat hath left the middle parts, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoisture begins to disperse itself again; and according to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tits natural motion, by a speedy conveyance into all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparts, it refreshes the entrails, softens and makes tender\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe dry and parched flesh. Very often also it causes sweat,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand then the defect which occasioned thirst ceases; for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoisture leaving that part of the body wherein it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforcibly detained, and out of which it hardly made an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tescape, retires to the place where it is wanted. For as it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfares with a garden wherein there is a large well,if nobody draw thereof and water it, the herbs must needs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twither and die,so it fares with a body; if all the moisture be contracted into one part, it is no wonder if the rest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe in want and dry, till it is diffused again over the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlimbs. Just so it happens to persons in a fever, after the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\theat of the disease is over, and likewise to those who go\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto sleep thirsty. For in these, sleep draws the moisture\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tout of the middle parts, and equally distributes it amongst\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rest, satisfying them all. But, I pray, what kind of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttransfiguration of the passages is this which causes hunger\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand thirst? For my part, I know no other distinction of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe passages but in respect of their number, or that some\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof them are shut, others open. As for those that are shut,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey can neither receive meat nor drink; and as for those\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat are open, they make an empty space, which is nothing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut a want of that which Nature requires. Thus, sir,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen men dye cloth, the liquor in which they dip it hath\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvery sharp and abstersive particles; which, consuming and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tscouring off all the matter that filled the pores, make the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcloth more apt to receive the dye, because its pores are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tempty and want something to fill them up."}]}]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "3", "head": {"lb": [null, null], "#text": "Question III.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t WHAT IS THE REASON THAT HUNGER IS ALLAYED BY DRINKING, BUT THIRST INCREASED BY EATING?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t THE HOST, PLUTARCH, AND OTHERS."}, "div3": [{"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "p": "AFTER we had gone thus far, the master of the feast\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttold the company that the former points were reasonably\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell discussed; and waiving at present the discourse concerning the evacuation and repletion of the pores, he requested us to fall upon another question, that is, how it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomes to pass that hunger is staid by drinking, when, on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe contrary, thirst is more violent after eating.

And unless the thing were explained after this manner, the hardest knot in the question would still remain unsolved. For a man that has a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthirst upon him, supposing he eats and doth not drink, is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tso far from quenching, that he does highly increase it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis point is yet untouched. But mark, said I, whether\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe positions on my side be clear and evident or not. In\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first place, we take it for granted that moisture is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twasted and destroyed by dryness, that the drier parts of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnourishment, qualified and softened by moisture, are diffused and fly away in vapors. Secondly, we must by no\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeans suppose that all hunger is a total privation of dry,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand thirst of humid nutriment, but only a moderate one,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand such as is sufficient to cause the one or the other; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhoever are wholly deprived of either of these, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tneither hunger nor thirst, but die instantly. These things\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing laid down as a foundation, it will be no hard matter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto find out the cause. Thirst is increased by eating for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis reason, because that meat by its natural siccity contracts and destroys all that small quantity of moisture\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich remained scattered here and there through the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbody; just as it happens in things obvious to our senses;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twe see the earth, dust, and the like presently suck in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoisture that is mixed with them. Now, on the contrary,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrink must of necessity assuage hunger; for the moisture\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twatering and diffusing itself through the dry and parched\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelics of the meat we ate last, by turning them into thin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjuices, conveys them through the whole body, and succors the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindigent parts. And therefore with very good reason Erasistratus called moisture the vehicle of the meat; for as soon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas this is mixed with things which by reason of their dryness,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor some other quality, are slow and heavy, it raises them\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tup and carries them aloft. Moreover, several men, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey have drunk nothing at all, but only washed themselves, all on a sudden are freed from a violent hunger, because the extrinsic moisture entering the pores makes the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeat within more succulent and of a more nourishing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnature, so that the heat and fury of the hunger declines\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand abates; and therefore a great many of those who have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta mind to starve themselves to death live a long time only\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby drinking water; that is, as long as the siccity does not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquite consume whatever may be united to and nourish the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbody."}]}]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "4", "head": {"lb": [null, null], "#text": "Question IV.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t WHAT IS THE REASON THAT A BUCKET OF WATER DRAWN OUT OF\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA WELL, IF IT STANDS ALL NIGHT IN THE AIR THAT IS IN THE\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWELL, IS MORE COLD IN THE MORNING THAN THE REST OF THE WATER?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t A GUEST, PLUTARCH, AND OTHERS."}, "div3": [{"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "v.3.p.348"}, "#text": "ONE of the strangers at the table, who took wonderful great delight in drinking of cold water, had some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought to him by the servants, cooled after this manner;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had hung in the well a bucket full of the same water,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso that it could not touch the sides of the well, and there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlet it remain all night: the next day, when it was brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto table, it was colder than the water that was new-drawn.

Why therefore should\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twe rather say the clothes are hot, because they cause heat,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan cold, because they cause cold? Nay, if we must be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttried by sense, it will be found that they are more cold than\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thot. For at the first putting on of a coat it is cold, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tso is our bed when we lie down; but afterwards they grow\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thot with the heat of our bodies, because they both keep\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the heat and keep out the cold. Indeed, feverish persons and others that have a violent heat upon them often\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchange their clothes, because they perceive that fresh ones\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat the first putting on are much colder; but within a very\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle time their bodies make them as hot as the others. In\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlike manner, as a garment heated makes us hot, so a covering cooled keeps snow cold. Now that which causes this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcold is the continual emanations of a subtile spirit the snow\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas in it, which spirit, as long as it remains in the snow,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkeeps it compact and close; but, after once it is gone, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsnow melts and dissolves into water, and instantly loses its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhiteness, occasioned by a mixture of this spirit with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrothy moisture. Therefore at the same time, by the help\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof these clothes, the cold is kept in, and the external air\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis shut out, lest it should thaw the concrete body of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsnow. The reason why they make use of cloth that has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot yet been at the fuller's is this, because that in such\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcloth the hair and coarse flocks keep it off from pressing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttoo hard upon the snow, and bruising it. So chaff lying\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlightly upon it does not dissolve the body of the snow, besides the chaff lies close and shuts out the warm air, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkeeps in the natural cold of the snow.

Besides he would needs persuade us that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit showed too much of a vain curiosity, effeminacy, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tluxury, to convert what is wholesome into that which is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpalatable.

For they certainly take off all the strength from the wine, by straining\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof it.

But you will say that wine not strained hath a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeal more strength. Why so, my friend? One that is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrantic and distracted has more strength than a man in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\twits; but when, by the help of hellebore or some other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfit diet, he is come to himself, that rage and frenzy leave\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim and quite vanish, and the true use of his reason and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thealth of body presently comes into its place. In like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanner, purging of wine takes from it all the strength that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflames and enrages the mind, and gives it instead thereof\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta mild and wholesome temper; and I think there is a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeal of difference between gaudiness and cleanliness.

Indeed, I must confess, our eye assures us that a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfig-tree sends out a fierce and strong spirit; which is yet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore evident, from what we have heard said of bulls.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat is, a bull, after he is tied to a fig-tree, though never\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tso mad before, grows presently tame, and will suffer you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto touch him, and on a sudden all his rage and fury cool\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand die. But the chiefest cause that works this change is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sharp acrimonious quality of the tree. For of all\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttrees this is the fullest of sap, and so are its figs, wood,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand bark; and hence it comes to pass, that the smoke of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfig-wood is most offensive to the eyes; and when it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tburned, its ashes make the best lye to scour withal. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall these effects proceed from heat. Now there are some\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat say, when the sap of this tree thrown into milk curds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit, that this effect does not arise from the irregular figures\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the parts of the milk, which the sap unites and (as it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere) glues into one body, the smooth and globose parts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing squeezed out, but that by its heat it loosens the unstable and watery parts of the liquid body. And we may\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuse as an argument the unprofitableness of the sap of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttree, which, though it is very sweet, yet makes the worst\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tliquor in the world. For it is not the inequality in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparts that affects the smooth part, but what is cold and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\traw is contracted by heat. And salt helps to produce\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same effect; for it is hot, and works in opposition to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe uniting of the parts just mentioned, causing rather a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdissolution; for to it, above all other things, Nature has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven a dissolving faculty. Therefore the fig-tree sends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforth a hot and sharp spirit, which cuts and boils the flesh\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the bird. The very same thing may be effected by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplacing the flesh upon a heap of corn, or near nitre; the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\theat will produce the same that the fig-tree did.

And all know that in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinflammation of the lungs the patient is troubled with extreme thirst; the heat or dryness or some other cause,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether with the inflammation, making the appetite intense. But a stronger evidence than all these follows.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThose creatures that have very small lungs, or none at all,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tneither want nor desire drink, because to some parts there\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbelongs a natural appetite to drink, and those that want\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthose parts have no need to drink, nor any appetite to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupplied by it.

But now the bladder is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdistinct from the guts, because the drink goes from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlungs, and the meat from the stomach; they being separated as we take them down. And this is the reason that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin our water nothing can be found that either in smell or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcolor resembles dry food. But if the drink were mixed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith the dry meat in the belly, it must be impregnant with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tits qualities, and not come forth so simple and untinged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBesides, a stone is never found in the stomach, though it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis likely that the moisture should be coagulated there as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twell as in the bladder, if all the liquor were conveyed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the weasand into the belly. But it is probable that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe weasand robs the windpipe of a sufficient quantity of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tliquor as it is going down, and useth it to soften and concoct the meat.

Indeed many sorts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof music are to be rejected; first, tragedy, as having nothing familiar enough for an entertainment, and being a representation of actions attended with grief and extremity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof passion. I reject the sort of dancing which is called\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPyladean from Pylades, because it is full of pomp, very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpathetical, and requires a great many persons; but if we\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould admit any of those sorts that deserve those encomiums which Socrates mentions in his discourse about dancing, I like that sort called Bathyllean, which requires not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso high a motion, but hath something of the nature of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCordax, and resembles the motion of an Echo, a Pan, or a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSatyr frolicking with love. Old comedy is not fit for men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat are making merry, by reason of the irregularities that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappear in it; for that vehemency which they use in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparabasis is loud and indecent, and the liberty they take to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscoff and abuse is very surfeiting, too open, and full of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfilthy words and lewd expressions. Besides, as at great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen's tables every man hath a servant waiting at his elbow,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso each of his guests would need a grammarian to sit by\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, and explain who is Laespodias in Eupolis, Cinesias\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Plato, and Lampo in Cratinus, and who is each person\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat is jeered in the play. Concerning new comedy there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis no need of any long discourse. It is so fitted, so interwoven with entertainments, that it is easier to have a regular feast without wine, than without Menander. Its phrase\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis sweet and familiar, the humor innocent and easy, so that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is nothing for men whilst sober to despise, or when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmerry to be troubled at. The sentiments are so natural\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand unstudied, that midst wine, as it were in fire, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoften and bend the rigidest temper to be pliable and easy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd the mixture of gravity and jests seems to be contrived for nothing so aptly as for the pleasure and profit of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose that are frolicking and making merry. The love-scenes in Menander are convenient for those who have\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready taken their cups, and who in a short time must\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretire home to their wives; for in all his plays there is no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlove of boys mentioned, and all rapes committed on virgins\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend decently in marriages at last. As for misses, if they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare impudent and jilting, they are bobbed, the young gallants turning sober, and repenting of their lewd courses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut if they are kind and constant, either their true parents\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare discovered, or a time is determined for the intrigue,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich brings them at last to obliging modesty and civil\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkindness. These things to men busied about other matters\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmay seem scarce worth taking notice of; but whilst they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare making merry, it is no wonder that the pleasantness\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand smoothness of the parts should work a neat conformity and elegance in the hearers, and make their manners\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike the pattern they have from those genteel characters."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "4", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v.3.p.392"}, {"@id": "v.3.p.393"}, {"@id": "v.3.p.394"}], "#text": "Diogenianus, either designedly or for want of breath,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tended thus. And when the sophister came upon him again,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand contended that some of Aristophanes's verses should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe recited, Philip speaking to me said: Diogenianus hath\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad his wish in praising his beloved Menander, and seems\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot to care for any of the rest. There are a great many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsorts which we have not at all considered, concerning\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich I should be very glad to have your opinion; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe prize for carvers we will set up to-morrow, when we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare sober, if Diogenianus and this stranger think fit. Of\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepresentations, said I, some are mythical, and some are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfarces; neither of these are fit for an entertainment; the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst by reason of their length and cost, and the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing so full of filthy discourse and lewd actions, that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare not fit to be seen by the foot-boys that wait on civil\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmasters. Yet the rabble, even with their wives and young\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsons, sit quietly to be spectators of such representations as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare apt to disturb the soul more than the greatest debauch\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin drink. The harp ever since Homer's time was well acquainted with feasts and entertainments, and therefore it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis not fitting to dissolve such an ancient friendship and acquaintance; but we should only desire the harpers to forbear their sad notes and melancholy tunes, and play only\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose that are delighting, and fit for such as are making\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmerry. The pipe, if we would, we cannot reject, for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlibation in the beginning of the entertainment requires that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas well as the garland. Then it insinuates and passeth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the ears, spreading even to the very soul a pleasant sound, which produceth serenity and calmness; so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, if the wine hath not quite dissolved or driven away\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall vexing solicitous anxiety, this, by the softness and delightful agreeableness of its sound, smooths and calms the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspirits, if so be that it keeps within due bounds, and doth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot elevate too much, and, by its numerous surprising divisions, raise an ecstasy in the soul which wine hath weakened and made easy to be perverted. For as brutes do\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot understand a rational discourse, yet lie down or rise up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the sound of a shell or whistle, or of a chirp or clap; so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe brutish part of the soul, which is incapable either of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderstanding or obeying reason, men conquer by songs\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand tunes, and by music reduce it to tolerable order. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto speak freely what I think, no pipe nor harp simply\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplayed upon, and without a song with it, can be very fit for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan entertainment. For we should still accustom ourselves\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto take our chiefest pleasure from discourse, and spend our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleisure time in profitable talk, and use tunes and airs as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsauce for the discourse, and not singly by themselves, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplease the unreasonable delicacy of our palate. For as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnobody is against pleasure that ariseth from sauce or wine\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing in with our necessary food, but Socrates flouts and\n\t\t\t\t\t\trefuseth to admit that superfluous and vain pleasure which\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe take in perfumes and odors at a feast; thus the sound\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof a pipe or harp, when singly applied to our ears, we utterly reject, but if it accompanies words, and together\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith an ode feasts and delights our reason, we gladly introduce it. And we believe the famed Marsyas was punished by Apollo for pretending, when he had nothing but\n\t\t\t\t\t\this single pipe, and his muzzle to secure his lips, to contend with the harp and song of the God. Let us only take\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcare that, when we have such guests as are able to cheer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone another with philosophy and good discourse, we do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot introduce any thing that may rather prove an uneasy\n\t\t\t\t\t\thindrance to the conversation than promote it. For not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly are those fools, who, as Euripides says, having safety\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat home and in their own power, yet would hire some from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabroad; but those too who, having pleasantness enough\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithin, are eager after some external pastimes to comfort\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand delight them. That extraordinary piece of honor\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich the Persian king showed Antalcidas the Spartan\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseemed rude and uncivil, when he dipped a garland composed of crocus and roses in ointment, and sent it him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\twear, by that dipping putting a slight upon and spoiling\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe natural sweetness and beauty of the flowers. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoth as bad, who having a Muse in his own breast, and all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pleasantness that would fit an entertainment, will have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpipes and harps play, and by that external adventitious\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoise destroy all the sweetness that was proper and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\town. But in short, all ear-delights are fittest then, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe company begins to be disturbed, fall out, and quarrel, for then they may prevent raillery and reproach, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstop the dispute that is running on to sophistical and unpleasant wrangling, and bridle all babbling declamatory\n\t\t\t\t\t\taltercations, so that the company maybe freed of noise and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquietly composed."}}]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "9", "head": {"lb": [null, null], "#text": "Question IX.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t THAT IT WAS THE CUSTOM OF THE GREEKS AS WELL AS PERSIANS TO DEBATE OF STATE AFFAIRS AT THEIR ENTERTAINMENTS.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t NICOSTRATUS, GLAUCIAS."}, "div3": {"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "p": [{"quote": {"@rend": "blockquote", "#text": "After your belly's full, your counsel's best."}, "#text": "AT Nicostratus's table we discoursed of those matters\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich the Athenians were to debate of in their next assembly.

To\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrink freely is different from being drunk, and those that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrink till they grow foolish ought to retire to bed. But as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor those that drink freely and are otherwise men of sense,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhy should we fear that they will fail in their understanding or lose their skill, when we see that musicians play\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas well at a feast as in a theatre?

Now the coldness of the night makes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch a constipation. Heat opens and separates the parts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof condensed bodies. Therefore bodies that boil, grow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoft, or melt, require a greater space than before; but on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe contrary, the parts of the body that are condensed or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreeze are contracted closer to one another, and leave those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvessels and places from which they retired partly empty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow the voice, meeting and striking against a great many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbodies in its way, is either altogether lost or scattered, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery much and very frequently hindered in its passage;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut when it hath a plain and smooth way through an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tempty space, and comes to the ear uninterrupted, the passage is so sudden, that it preserves its articulate distinctness, as well as the words it carries. You may observe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat empty vessels, when knocked, answer presently, send\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout a noise to a great distance, and oftentimes the sound\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhirled round in the hollow breaks out with a considerable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforce; whilst a vessel that is filled either with a liquid or a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolid body will not answer to a stroke, because the sound\n\t\t\t\t\t\thath no room or passage to come through. And among\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolid bodies themselves, gold and stone, because they want\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpores, can hardly be made to sound; and when a noise is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade by a stroke upon them, it is very flat, and presently\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlost. But brass is sounding, it being a porous, rare, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlight metal, not consisting of parts closely compacted, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing mixed with a yielding and uncompacted substance,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich gives free passage to other motions, and kindly receiving the sound sends it forward; till some touching the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstrument do, as it were, seize on it in the way, and stop\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe hollow; for then, by reason of the hindering force, it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstops and goes no farther. And this, in my opinion, is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason why the night is more sonorous, and the day less;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince in the day, the heat rarefying the air makes the empty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspaces between the particles to be very little.

Therefore they do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot believe that its water is wholesome, or that any creature produced or nourished in it can be clean or wholesome food for man, since it breathes not the common air,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand feeds not on the same food with him.

Heretofore too, as I have heard, they hated the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbrain of animals so much, that they abominated the very\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tname of it; as when Homer says,  And even now we know some old men, that will\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot taste cucumber, melon, orange, or pepper. Now by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese meats and drinks it is probable that the juices of our\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbodies are much altered, and their temperature changed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnew qualities arising from this new sort of diet. And the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchange of order in our feeding having a great influence on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe alteration of our bodies, the cold courses, as they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled formerly, consisting of oysters, sea-urchins, salads, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe like, being (in Plato's phrase) transferred  now make the first course, whereas they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tformerly the last. Besides, the glass which we usually take\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore supper is very considerable in this case; for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tancients never drank so much as water before they ate,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut now we drink freely before we sit down, and fall to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tour meat with a full and heated body, using sharp sauces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand pickles to provoke appetite, and then we fall greedily\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the other meat. But nothing conduceth more to alterations and new diseases in the body than our various baths;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor here the flesh, like iron in the fire, grows soft and loose,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand is presently constipated and hardened by the cold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor, in my opinion, if any of the last age had looked into\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tour baths, he might have justly said,"}, "For they used such mild gentle baths, that Alexander the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGreat being feverish slept in one. And the Gauls' wives\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcarry their pots of pulse to eat with their children whilst\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey are in the bath. But our baths now inflame, vellicate,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand distress; and the air which we draw is a mixture of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tair and water, disturbs the whole body, tosses and displaces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tevery atom, till we quench the fiery particles and allay\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir heat. Therefore, Diogenianus, you see that this account requires no new strange causes, no intermundane\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspaces; but the single alteration of our diet is enough to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\traise new diseases and abolish old."]}]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "10", "head": {"lb": [null, null], "#text": "Question X.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t WHY WE GIVE LEAST CREDIT TO DREAMS IN AUTUMN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t FLORUS, PLUTARCH, PLUTARCH'S SONS, FAVORINUS."}, "div3": [{"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "v.3.p.433"}, "#text": "FLORUS reading Aristotle's physical problems, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere brought to him to Thermopylae, was himself (as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tphilosophical wits used to be) filled with a great many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoubts, and communicated them to others; thereby confirming Aristotle's saying, that much learning raises many\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoubts.

He first\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaid down that known principle of his, that images pass\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the pores into the inmost parts of the body, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing carried upward cause dreams; and that these images\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfly from every thing, vessels, garments, plants, but especially from animals, because of their heat and the motion\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof their spirits; and that these images not only carry the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutward shape and likeness of the bodies (as Epicurus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthinks, following Democritus so far and no farther), but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe very designs, motions, and passions of the soul; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith those entering into the bodies, as if they were living\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings, discover to those that receive them the thoughts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand inclinations of the persons from whom they come, if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso be that they preserve their frame and order entire.

And\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAutobulus replied: Pray, sir, do not endeavor to cheat us\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany longer; for we know very well that you, designing to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake Aristotle's opinion appear the better, have used this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Democritus only as its shade. Therefore I shall pass\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby that, and impugn Aristotle's opinion, which unjustly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlays the blame on the new fruit. For both the summer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the early autumn bear testimony in its favor, when, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntimachus says, the fruit is most fresh and juicy; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen, though we eat the new fruit, yet our dreams are less\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvain than at other times. And the months when the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleaves fall, being next to winter, so concoct the corn and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremaining fruit, that they grow shrivelled and less, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlose all their brisk agitating spirit. As for new wine, those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat drink it soonest forbear till February, which is after\n\t\t\t\t\t\twinter; and the day on which we begin we call the day of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Good Genius, and the Athenians the day of cask-opening. For whilst wine is working, we see that even common\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaborers will not venture on it. Therefore no more accusing the gifts of the Gods, let us seek after another cause\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof vain dreams, to which the name of the season will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirect us. For it is called  because the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleaves then fall on account of their dryness and coldness;\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcept the leaves of hot and oily trees, as of the olive the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaurel, or the palm; or of the moist, as of the myrtle and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ivy. But the temperature of these preserves them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough not others; because in others the vicious humor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat holds the leaves is constipated by the cold, or being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweak and little is dried up. Now moisture and heat are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessary for the growth and preservation of plants, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially of animals; and on the contrary, coldness and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdryness are very noxious to both. And therefore Homer\n\t\t\t\t\t\telegantly calls men moist and juicy; to rejoice he calls\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be warmed; and any thing that is grievous and frightful he calls cold and icy. Besides, the words  and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t are applied to the dead, those names intimating\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir extreme dryness. But more, our blood, the principal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthing in our whole body, is moist and hot. And old age\n\t\t\t\t\t\thath neither of those two qualities. Now the autumn\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseems to be as it were the old age of the decaying year;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the moisture doth not yet fall, and the heat decays.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd its inclining the body to diseases is an evident sign of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits cold and dryness. Now it is necessary that the souls\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be indisposed with the bodies and that, the subtile\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspirit being condensed, the divining faculty of the soul,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike a mirror that is breathed upon, should be sullied;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand therefore it cannot represent any thing plain, distinct, and clear, as long as it remains thick, dark, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcondensed."}}]}]}, {"@type": "book", "@n": "9", "head": "Book 9.", "div2": [{"@type": "chapter", "@n": "0", "div3": {"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "v.3.p.436"}, "#text": "This ninth book, Sossius Senecio, contains the discourses\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe held at Athens at the Muses' feast, for this number nine\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis agreeable to the number of the Muses.

But, as I think, the ancients,\n\t\t\t\t\t\treducing all arts and sciences which are practised and performed by reason or discourse to three heads, philosophy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\trhetoric, and mathematics, accounted them the gifts of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthree Gods, and named them the Muses. Afterwards, about\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHesiod's time, the sciences being better and more thoroughly looked into, men subdividing them found that each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscience contained three different parts. In mathematics\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare comprehended music, arithmetic, and geometry; in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy are logic, ethics, and physics.

For my part, since Plato admits two principles of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tevery action, the natural desire after pleasure, and acquired\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\topinion which covets and wishes for the best, and calls one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treason and the other passion, and since each of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis manifold, I think that each requires a considerable and, to speak the truth, a divine direction. For instance, one faculty of our reason is said to be political\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor imperial, over which Hesiod says Calliope presides;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClio's province is the noble and aspiring; and Polymnia's\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat faculty of the soul which inclines to attain and keep\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tknowledge (and therefore the Sicyonians call one of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthree Muses Polymathia); to Euterpe everybody allows\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe searches into nature and physical speculations, there\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing no greater, no sincerer pleasure belonging to any\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother sort of speculation in the world.
