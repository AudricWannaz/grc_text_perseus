For concerning this it is that there are so\n\t\t\t\tmany natural, moral, and logical questions. Having therefore already in some sort sufficiently defined what it is, we\n\t\t\t\tare now in the next place to say something of its quality,\n\t\t\t\talthough it may to many seem absurd. I say then that\n\t\t\t\tFate, though comprehending as it were in a circle the infinity of all those things which are and have been from\n\t\t\t\tinfinite times and shall be to infinite ages, is not in itself\n\t\t\t\tinfinite, but determinate and finite; for neither law, reason,\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tnor any other divine thing can be infinite. And this you\n\t\t\t\twill the better understand, if you consider the total revolution and the whole time in which the revolutions of the\n\t\t\t\teight circles (that is, of the eight spheres of the fixed stars,\n\t\t\t\tsun, moon, and five planets), having (as Timaeus says)\n\t\t\t\tfinished their course, return to one and the same point,\n\t\t\t\tbeing measured by the circle of the Same, which goes\n\t\t\t\talways after one manner. For in this order, which is\n\t\t\t\tfinite and determinate, shall all things (which, as well in\n\t\t\t\theaven as in earth, consist by necessity from above) be reduced to the same situation, and restored again to their\n\t\t\t\tfirst beginning. Wherefore the habitude of heaven alone,\n\t\t\t\tbeing thus ordained in all things, as well in regard of itself\n\t\t\t\tas of the earth and all terrestrial matters, shall again (after\n\t\t\t\tlong revolutions) one day return; and those things that in\n\t\t\t\torder follow after, and being linked together in a continuity\n\t\t\t\tare maintained in their course, shall be present, every one\n\t\t\t\tof them by necessity bringing what is its own. But for\n\t\t\t\tthe better clearing of this matter, let us understand that\n\t\t\t\twhatever is in us or about us is not wrought by the course\n\t\t\t\tof the heavens and heavenly influences, as being entirely\n\t\t\t\tthe efficient cause both of my writing what I now write,\n\t\t\t\tand of your doing also what you at present do, and in the\n\t\t\t\tsame manner as you do it. Hereafter then, when the same\n\t\t\t\tcause shall return, we shall do the same things we now do,\n\t\t\t\tand in the same manner, and shall again become the same\n\t\t\t\tmen; and so it will be with all others. And that which\n\t\t\t\tfollows after shall also happen by the following cause; and\n\t\t\t\tin brief, all things that shall happen in the whole and in\n\t\t\t\tevery one of these universal revolutions shall again become\n\t\t\t\tthe same. By this it appears (as we have said before) that\n\t\t\t\tFate, being in some sort infinite, is nevertheless determinate\n\t\t\t\tand finite; and it may be also in some sort seen and comprehended, as we have farther said, that it is as it were a\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tcircle. For as a motion of a circle is a circle, and the time\n\t\t\t\tthat measures it is also a circle; so the order of things\n\t\t\t\twhich are done and happen in a circle may be justly\n\t\t\t\testeemed and called a circle."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "4", "p": [{"pb": {"@id": "v.5.p.297"}, "#text": "This therefore, though there should be nothing else,\n\t\t\t\talmost shows us what sort of thing Fate is; but not particularly or in every respect. What kind of thing then is\n\t\t\t\tit in its own form? It is, as far as one can compare it,\n\t\t\t\tlike to the civil or politic law. For first it commands the\n\t\t\t\tmost part of things at least, if not all, conditionally; and\n\t\t\t\tthen it comprises (as far as is possible for it) all things that\n\t\t\t\tbelong to the public in general; and the better to make\n\t\t\t\tyou understand both the one and the other, we must\n\t\t\t\tspecify them by an example. The civil law speaks and\n\t\t\t\tordains in general of a valiant man, and also of a deserter\n\t\t\t\tand a coward; and in the same manner of others. Now\n\t\t\t\tthis is not to make the law speak of this or that man in\n\t\t\t\tparticular, but principally to propose such things as are\n\t\t\t\tuniversal or general, and consequently such as fall under\n\t\t\t\tthem. For we may very well say, that it is legal to reward\n\t\t\t\tthis man for having demeaned himself valiantly, and to\n\t\t\t\tpunish that man for flying from his colors; because the\n\t\t\t\tlaw has virtuallythough not in express terms and particularly yet in such general ones as they are comprehended under,so determined of them. As the law (if\n\t\t\t\tI may so speak) of physicians and masters of corporal\n\t\t\t\texercises potentially comprehends particular and special\n\t\t\t\tthings within the general; so the law of Nature, determining first and principally general matters, secondarily and\n\t\t\t\tconsequently determines such as are particular. Thus,\n\t\t\t\tgeneral things being decreed by Fate, particular and individual things may also in some sort be said to be so, because they are so by consequence with the general. But\n\t\t\t\tperhaps some one of those who more accurately examine\n\t\t\t\tand more subtly search into these things may say, on the\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tcontrary, that particular and individual things precede the\n\t\t\t\tcomposition of general things, and that the general exist\n\t\t\t\tonly for the particular, since that for which another thing\n\t\t\t\tis always goes before that which is for it. Nevertheless,\n\t\t\t\tthis is not the proper place to treat of this difficulty, but\n\t\t\t\tit is to be remitted to another. However, that Fate comprehends not all things clearly and expressly, but only such\n\t\t\t\tas are universal and general, let it pass for resolved on at\n\t\t\t\tpresent, as well for what we have already said a little before, as for what we shall say hereafter. For that which\n\t\t\t\tis finite and determinate, agreeing properly with divine\n\t\t\t\tProvidence, is seen more in universal and general things\n\t\t\t\tthan in particular; such therefore is the divine law, and\n\t\t\t\talso the civil; but infinity consists in particulars and individuals."}, {"q": [{"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "conditionally"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "And this is the sanction\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Adrastea (or an inevitable ordinance), that whatever\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoul, being an attendant on God, shall see any thing of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttruth, shall till another revolution be exempt from punishment; and if it is always able to do the same, it shall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnever suffer any damage."}], "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "This is the whole passage from Plato's Phaedrus, p. 248 C, of which part is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquoted in  1.

Neither indeed can I affirm of the performing a valorous act in war, the killing of a tyrant, or\n\t\t\t\tthe doing any other virtuous deed, that it is legal; because that only is proper to be called legal, which is commanded by the law. Now if the law commands these\n\t\t\t\tthings, how can they avoid being rebels against the law\n\t\t\t\tand transgressors of it, who neither perform valiant feats\n\t\t\t\tof arms, kill tyrants, nor do any other such remarkable\n\t\t\t\tacts of virtue?

In like manner, those things only are fatal\n\t\t\t\tand according to Fate, which are the consequences of\n\t\t\t\tcauses preceding in the divine disposition.

Now the nature of the possible is to presubsist,\n\t\t\t\tas the genus, and to go before the contingent; and the\n\t\t\t\tcontingent, as the matter and subject, is to be presupposed\n\t\t\t\tto free will; and our free will ought as a master to make use\n\t\t\t\tof the contingent; and Fortune comes in by the side of\n\t\t\t\tfree will, through the property of the contingent of inclining\n\t\t\t\tto either part. Now you will more easily apprehend what\n\t\t\t\thas been said, if you shall consider that every thing which\n\t\t\t\tis generated, and the generation itself, is not done without\n\t\t\t\ta generative faculty or power, and the power is not without a substance. As for example, neither the generation\n\t\t\t\tof man, nor that which is generated, is without a power;\n\t\t\t\tbut this power is about man, and man himself is the substance. Now the power or faculty is between the substance, which is the powerful, and the generation and the\n\t\t\t\tthing generated, which are both possibles. There being\n\t\t\t\tthen these three things, the power, the powerful, and the\n\t\t\t\tpossible; before the power can exist, the powerful must\n\t\t\t\tof necessity be presupposed as its subject, and the power\n\t\t\t\tmust also necessarily subsist before the possible. By this\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tdeduction then may in some measure be understood what\n\t\t\t\tis meant by possible; which may be grossly defined as\n\t\t\t\t or yet more\n\t\t\t\texactly, if to this same there be added,  Now\n\t\t\t\tof possible things there are some which can never be\n\t\t\t\thindered, as are those in heaven, to wit, the rising and\n\t\t\t\tsetting of the stars, and the like to these; but others may\n\t\t\t\tindeed be hindered, as are the most part of human things,\n\t\t\t\tand many also of those which are done in the air. The\n\t\t\t\tfirst, as being done by necessity, are called necessary; the\n\t\t\t\tothers, which may fall one way or other, are called contingent; and they may both thus be described. The\n\t\t\t\tnecessary possible is that whose contrary is impossible;\n\t\t\t\tand the contingent possible is that whose contrary is also\n\t\t\t\tpossible. For that the sun should set is a thing both\n\t\t\t\tnecessary and possible, forasmuch as it is contrary to this\n\t\t\t\tthat the sun should not set, which is impossible; but that,\n\t\t\t\twhen the sun is set, there should be rain or not rain, both\n\t\t\t\tthe one and the other is possible and contingent. And\n\t\t\t\tthe again of things contingent, some happen oftener,\n\t\t\t\tothers rarely and not so often, others fall out equally or\n\t\t\t\tindifferently, as well the one way as the other, even as it\n\t\t\t\thappens. Now it is manifest that those are contrary to\n\t\t\t\tone another,to wit, those which fall out oftener and\n\t\t\t\tthose which happen but seldom,and they both for the\n\t\t\t\tmost part depend on Nature; but that which happens\n\t\t\t\tequally, as much one way as another, depends on ourselves. For that under the Dog it should be either hot or\n\t\t\t\tcold, the one oftener, the other seldomer, are both things\n\t\t\t\tsubject to Nature; but to walk and not to walk, and all\n\t\t\t\tsuch things of which both the one and the other are submitted to the free will of man, are said to be in us and our\n\t\t\t\telection; but rather more generally to be in us. For there\n\t\t\t\tare two sorts of this  the one of\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\twhich proceeds from some sudden passion and motion\n\t\t\t\tof the mind, as from anger or pleasure; the other from\n\t\t\t\tthe discourse and judgment of reason, which may properly\n\t\t\t\tbe said to be in our election. And some reason there is\n\t\t\t\tto believe that this possible and contingent is the same\n\t\t\t\tthing with that which is said to be in us and according to\n\t\t\t\tour free will, although differently named. For in respect\n\t\t\t\tto the future, it is styled possible and contingent; and in\n\t\t\t\trespect of the present, it is named  and\n\t\t\t\t So that these things may thus be defined: The contingent is that which is itselfas well\n\t\t\t\tas its contrarypossible; and  is one part of the contingent, to wit, that which\n\t\t\t\tnow takes place according to our will. Thus have we in\n\t\t\t\ta manner declared, that the possible in the order of Nature\n\t\t\t\tprecedes the contingent, and that the contingent subsists\n\t\t\t\tbefore free will; as also what each of them is, whence\n\t\t\t\tthey are so named, and what are the qualities adjoined or\n\t\t\t\tappertaining to them."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "7", "p": [{"pb": {"@id": "v.5.p.302"}, "#text": "It now remains, that we treat of Fortune and casual\n\t\t\t\tadventure, and whatever else is to be considered with them.\n\t\t\t\tIt is therefore certain that Fortune is a cause.

Whence it appears,\n\t\t\t\tthat the cause by itself must needs be determinate and\n\t\t\t\tone; but the causes by accident are never one and the\n\t\t\t\tsame, but infinite and undetermined. For manynay, infiniteaccidents, wholly different one from the other, may\n\t\t\t\tbe in one and the same subject.
