Now that a fire of coals,\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch as they would have that of the moon to be, cannot\n\t\t\t\t\thave any continuance nor yet so much as the least subsistence, unless it meets with some solid matter fit to maintain it, keep it in, and feed it, has, I think, far better than\n\t\t\t\t\tit is by these philosophers, been understood by those poets\n\t\t\t\t\twho in merriment affirm that Vulcan was therefore said to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe lame because fire can no more go forward without wood\n\t\t\t\t\tor fuel than a cripple without a crutch.

For being rare and diffused, as by Nature it\n\t\t\t\t\tis, it is not fitted for permanency and continuance, but for\n\t\t\t\t\tchange and dissipation.

And since the swiftness\n\t\t\t\t\tand violence of motion is wont to inflame the air which is\n\t\t\t\t\tin stones, and even in lead itself, as cold as it is; much\n\t\t\t\t\tmore will it that which, being in fire, is with so great an\n\t\t\t\t\timpetuosity whirled about.

Now this is\n\t\t\t\t\tboth against the nature of permanency, and impossible to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe accorded with what we see in full moons; for it should\n\t\t\t\t\tnot appear separately black and dark, but either be wholly\n\t\t\t\t\tobscured and concealed or else co-illuminated, when the\n\t\t\t\t\tmoon is overspread by the sun. For with us the air which\n\t\t\t\t\tis in the pits and hollows of the earth, whither the rays of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sun cannot penetrate, remains dark and lightless; but\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is spread over its exterior parts has clearness\n\t\t\t\t\tand a lightsome color.

For this is a cone, as it must be\n\t\t\t\t\twhen a great fire or light that is spherical encompasses a\n\t\t\t\t\tmass that is also globular but less; whence it comes that,\n\t\t\t\t\tin the eclipses of the moon, the circumscriptions of the\n\t\t\t\t\tblack and dark from the clear and luminous have their\n\t\t\t\t\tsections always round. For the sections given or received\n\t\t\t\t\tby one round body applied to another, which way soever\n\t\t\t\t\tthey go, do by reason of the similitude always keep a circular form. Now as for the second argument, I suppose\n\t\t\t\t\tyou understand that the first part which is eclipsed in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmoon is always that which looks towards the east, and in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sun that which regards the west. Now the shadow of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe earth moves from the east to the west, but the sun and\n\t\t\t\t\tmoon from the west eastward. The experience of the appearances gives us a visible knowledge of this, nor is there\n\t\t\t\t\tneed of many words to make us fully understand it; and\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom these suppositions the cause of the eclipse is confirmed. For, inasmuch as the sun is eclipsed by being\n\t\t\t\t\tovertaken, and the moon by meeting that which makes\n\t\t\t\t\tthe eclipse, it probably or rather necessarily follows that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe one is surprised behind, and the other before.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the obstruction begins on that side whence that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich causes it first approaches. Now the moon comes\n\t\t\t\t\tupon the sun from the west, as striving in course with\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\thim and hastening after him; but the shadow of the earth\n\t\t\t\t\tcomes from the east, as that which has a contrary motion."}, {"pb": {"@id": "v.5.p.265"}, "#text": "The third argument is taken from the time and greatness of the eclipses. For the moon, if she is eclipsed\n\t\t\t\t\twhen she is on high in her apogee (or at her farthest distance from the earth), continues but a little while in her\n\t\t\t\t\tdefect or want of light; but when she suffers the same\n\t\t\t\t\taccident being low and in her perigee (or near the earth),\n\t\t\t\t\tshe is very much oppressed, and slowly gets out of the\n\t\t\t\t\tshadow; and yet, when she is low, she moves swifter, and\n\t\t\t\t\twhen high, slower. But the cause of the difference is in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe shadow, which is, like pyramids, broadest at the bottom or basis; and, growing still narrower by little and\n\t\t\t\t\tlittle, terminates in a sharp point at the top. Whence it\n\t\t\t\t\tcomes, that when she is low, she is embarrassed within\n\t\t\t\t\tgreater circles, traversing the bottom of the shadow and\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is most obscure and dark; but when she is high, being through the narrowness of the shadow (as it were) but\n\t\t\t\t\tin a shallow puddle, by which she is sullied, she immediately gets out again. I omit what was said particularly\n\t\t\t\t\tabout the bases and disposition of parts, for these admit\n\t\t\t\t\tof a rational explanation, so far as this is possible; but I\n\t\t\t\t\treturn to the subject properly before us, which has its\n\t\t\t\t\tfoundation in our senses. For we see that fire shines\n\t\t\t\t\tforth and appears brighter out of a dark and shady place,\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough the thickness of the caliginous air, which admits\n\t\t\t\t\tno effluxions or diffusions of the fire's virtue, but keeps in\n\t\t\t\t\tand contains its substance within itself. Or rather,if\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is a passion of the senses,as hot things, when near\n\t\t\t\t\tto cold ones, are felt to be hotter, and pleasures immediately after pains are found more vehement, so things\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are bright appear better when they are near to such\n\t\t\t\t\tas are obscure, the imagination being more strained and\n\t\t\t\t\textended by means of different passions. But there seems\n\t\t\t\t\tto be a greater appearance of probability in the first reason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For in the sun, all the nature of fire not only loses\n\t\t\t\t\tits faculty of illuminating, but is also rendered duller and\n\t\t\t\t\tmore unapt to burn, because the heat of the sun dissipates\n\t\t\t\t\tand scatters all its force."}, "If it were then true that the moon, being, as the Stoics\n\t\t\t\t\tsay, a muddy and troubled star, has a weak and duskish\n\t\t\t\t\tfire, it would be meet that she should suffer none of these\n\t\t\t\t\taccidents which she is now seen to suffer, but altogether\n\t\t\t\t\tthe contrary; to wit, that she should be seen when she is\n\t\t\t\t\thidden, and absconded when she appears; that is, she\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be concealed all the rest of the time, being obscured\n\t\t\t\t\tby the environing air, and again shine forth and become\n\t\t\t\t\tapparent and manifest for six months together, and afterwards disappear again five months, entering into the shadow\n\t\t\t\t\tof the earth.

And what needs there any more\n\t\t\t\t\tto be said, seeing that the very light of the sun, reverberated and sent back by the moon, loses all its heat; and of\n\t\t\t\t\this brightness, there comes to us with much ado but a\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall remainder, and that very languishing and weak? Is\n\t\t\t\t\tit then possible, that our sight, turning the same course,\n\t\t\t\t\tshould bring back any part of the solar image from the\n\t\t\t\t\tmoon? I for my part think it is not. But consider, I\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid, yourselves, that if our sight were in one and the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame manner affected and disposed towards the water and\n\t\t\t\t\ttowards the moon, the full moon would of necessity represent to us the images of the earth, plants, men, and stars,\n\t\t\t\t\tas is done by the water and all other sorts of mirrors.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd if there is no such reflection of our sight as to bring\n\t\t\t\t\tus back these images, either by reason of our said sight's\n\t\t\t\t\tweakness, or through the rugged inequality of the moon's\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperficies, let us no longer require that it should rebound\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst the sun."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "24", "p": ["We have then, said I, related, as far as our memory\n\t\t\t\twould carry it away, whatever was there said.

Now you know, that of this matter many\n\t\t\t\t\tthings have been said, as well merrily and in jest as\n\t\t\t\t\tseriously and in earnest. For of those who dwell under\n\t\t\t\t\tthe moon, it is said that she hangs over their heads, as if\n\t\t\t\t\tthey were so many Tantaluses; and on the contrary, of\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who inhabit her, that being tied and bound to her,\n\t\t\t\t\tlike a sort of Ixious, they are with violence turned and\n\t\t\t\t\twhirled about. Nor is the moon indeed moved by one\n\t\t\t\t\tonly motion, but is, as they were wont to call her, Trivia,\n\t\t\t\t\tor Three-wayed; performing her course together according\n\t\t\t\t\tto length, breadth, and depth in the Zodiac; the first of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich motions mathematicians call a direct revolution, the\n\t\t\t\t\tsecond volutation, or an oblique winding and wheeling in\n\t\t\t\t\tand out; and the third (I know not why) an inequality;\n\t\t\t\t\talthough they see that she has no motion uniform, settled,\n\t\t\t\t\tand certain, in all her circuits and reversions. Wherefore\n\t\t\t\t\tit is not greatly to be admired, if through violence of her\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion there sometime fell a lion from her into Peloponnesus, but it is rather to be wondered, that we do not daily\n\t\t\t\t\tsee ten thousand falls of men and women and shocks of\n\t\t\t\t\tother animals tumbling down thence with their heels upwards on our heads; for it would be a mockery to dispute\n\t\t\t\t\tabout their habitation there, if they can have there neither\n\t\t\t\t\tbirth nor existence. For seeing the Egyptians and the\n\t\t\t\t\tTroglodytes, over whose heads the sun directly stands only\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tone moment of one day in the solstice, and then presently\n\t\t\t\t\tretires, can hardly escape being burnt, by reason of the\n\t\t\t\t\tair's excessive dryness; is it credible that those who are\n\t\t\t\t\tin the moon can bear every year twelve solstices, the sun\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing once a month just in their zenith, when the moon is\n\t\t\t\t\tfull? As for winds, clouds, and showers, without which\n\t\t\t\t\tthe plants can neither come up nor, when they are come\n\t\t\t\t\tup, be preserved, it cannot be so much as imagined there\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be any, where the ambient air is so hot, dry, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsubtile; since even here below, the tops of mountains\n\t\t\t\t\tnever feel those hard and bitter winters, but the air, being\n\t\t\t\t\tthere pure and clear, without any agitation, by reason of\n\t\t\t\t\tits lightness, avoids all that thickness and concretion which\n\t\t\t\t\tis amongst us; unless, by Jupiter, we will say that, as\n\t\t\t\t\tMinerva instilled nectar and ambrosia into the mouth of\n\t\t\t\t\tAchilles, when he received no other food, so the moon,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich both is called and indeed is Minerva, nourishes men,\n\t\t\t\t\tproducing for them and sending them every day ambrosia,\n\t\t\t\t\twith which, as old Pherecydes was wont to say, the Gods\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves are fed.

There is\n\t\t\t\t\tthen nothing to hinder but that the moon may be without\n\t\t\t\t\tliving creatures, and yet give reflections to the light that is\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffused about her, and afford a receptacle to the rays of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe stars, which have their confluence and temperature in\n\t\t\t\t\ther, for to digest the evaporation rising from the earth and\n\t\t\t\t\tmoderate the over-violent and fiery heat of the sun. And\n\t\t\t\t\tattributing much to ancient fame, we will say that she is\n\t\t\t\t\tstyled Diana, as being a virgin and fruitless, but otherwise\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatly salutary, helpful, and profitable to the world.\n\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, of all that has been said, my friend Theon, there\n\t\t\t\t\tis nothing which shows it impossible for the moon to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tinhabited. For her turning about, being gentle, mild, and\n\t\t\t\t\tcalm, dulcifies and polishes the ambient air, and distributes\n\t\t\t\t\tit in so good order about her, that there is no occasion to\n\t\t\t\t\tfear the falling or slipping out of those who live in her.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd as to the diversity and multiplicity of her motion, it\n\t\t\t\t\tproceeds not from any inequality, error, or uncertainty, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe astrologers show in this an admirable order and course,\n\t\t\t\t\tenclosing her within circles, which are turned by other\n\t\t\t\t\tcircles; some supposing that she herself stirs not, others\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking her always move equally, smoothly, and with the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame swiftness. For it is these ascensions of divers circles,\n\t\t\t\t\twith their turnings and habitudes, one towards another and\n\t\t\t\t\twith respect to us, which most exactly make those heights,\n\t\t\t\t\tdepths, and depressions, that appear to us in her motion,\n\t\t\t\t\tand her digressions in latitude, all joined with the ordinary\n\t\t\t\t\trevolution she makes in longitude. As to the great heat\n\t\t\t\t\tand continual inflammation of the sun, you will cease to\n\t\t\t\t\tfear it, if first to the eleven estival conjunctions you oppose\n\t\t\t\t\tthe full moons, and then to the excesses the continuity of\n\t\t\t\t\tchange which permits them not to last long, reducing them\n\t\t\t\t\tto a proper and peculiar temperature, and taking from\n\t\t\t\t\tthem both what is over much; for the middle, or what is\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween them, it is probable, has a season most like to the\n\t\t\t\t\tspring. And, moreover, the sun sends his beams to us\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough a gross and troubled air, and casts on us an heat\n\t\t\t\t\tfed by exhalation; whereas the air, being there subtile and\n\t\t\t\t\ttransparent, dissipates and disperses his lustre, which has\n\t\t\t\t\tno nourishment nor body on which it may settle. Trees\n\t\t\t\t\tand fruits are here nourished by showers; but elsewhere, as\n\t\t\t\t\tin the higher countries with you about Thebes and Syene,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe earth drinking in not aerial but earth-bred water, and\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing assisted with refreshing winds and dew, will not\n\t\t\t\t\t(such is the virtue and temperature of the soil) yield the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst place for fertility to the best watered land in the\n\t\t\t\t\tworld. And the same sorts of trees which in our country,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\thaving suffered a long and sharp winter, bring forth abundance of good fruit, are in Africa and with you in Egypt\n\t\t\t\t\tsoon offended with cold and very fearful of the winter.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd the provinces of Gedrosia and Troglodytis, which lie\n\t\t\t\t\tnear the ocean sea, being by reason of drought barren and\n\t\t\t\t\twithout any trees, there grow nevertheless in the adjacent\n\t\t\t\t\tsea trees of a wonderful height and bigness, and green\n\t\t\t\t\teven to the very bottom; some of which they call olive-trees, others laurels, and others the hair of Isis. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthose plants which are named anacampserotes, being\n\t\t\t\t\thanged up after they are plucked out of the ground, not\n\t\t\t\t\tonly live, butwhich is morebud and put forth green\n\t\t\t\t\tleaves. Some seeds are sown in winter; and others in the\n\t\t\t\t\theat of summer, like sesame and millet. And thyme or\n\t\t\t\t\tcentaury, if it is sown in a rich and fat earth, and there\n\t\t\t\t\twell drenched and watered, degenerates from its natural\n\t\t\t\t\tquality and all its virtue, because it loves dryness and\n\t\t\t\t\tthrives in its own proper natural soil. Others cannot bear\n\t\t\t\t\tso much as the least dew, of which kind are the most part\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Arabian plants, and if they are but once wet, they\n\t\t\t\t\twither, fade, and die. What wonder is it then, if there\n\t\t\t\t\tgrow in the moon roots, seeds, and plants which have no\n\t\t\t\t\tneed of rains or winter colds, and are appropriated to a\n\t\t\t\t\tdry and subtile air, such as is that of summer? And why\n\t\t\t\t\tmay it not be probable that the moon sends forth warm\n\t\t\t\t\twinds, and that her shaking and agitation, as she moves, is\n\t\t\t\t\taccompanied by comfortable breezes, fine dews, and gentle\n\t\t\t\t\tmoistures, which are everywhere dispersed to furnish\n\t\t\t\t\tnutriment for the verdant plants?seeing she is not of\n\t\t\t\t\ther temperature ardent or parched with drought, but rather\n\t\t\t\t\tsoft, moist, and engendering all humidity. For there come\n\t\t\t\t\tnot from her to us any effects of dryness, but many of a\n\t\t\t\t\tfeminine moisture and softness, such as are the growing of\n\t\t\t\t\tplants, the putrefaction of flesh, the changing and flatness\n\t\t\t\t\tof wines, the tenderness and rotting of wood, and the easy\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliveries of child-bearing women. But because I am\n\t\t\t\t\tafraid of irritating again and provoking Pharnaceswho\n\t\t\t\t\tall this while speaks not a wordif I should allege the\n\t\t\t\t\tflowing and ebbing of the great ocean (as they themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tsay), and the increasing of the friths and straits, which\n\t\t\t\t\tswell and rise by the moon augmenting the moisture;\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore I will rather turn myself to you, my friend\n\t\t\t\t\tTheon.

And they think that those who\n\t\t\t\t\theretofore came thither with Hercules and were left there\n\t\t\t\t\tby him, mixing themselves with the people of Saturn,\n\t\t\t\t\traised up again the Greek nation, which was well near extinguished, brought under and supplanted by the language,\n\t\t\t\t\tlaws, and manners of the barbarians, and made it again\n\t\t\t\t\tflourish and recover its pristine vigor. And therefore in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat place they give the first honor to Hercules, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tsecond to Saturn. Now when the star of Saturn, by us\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled Phaenon and by them Nycturus, comes to the sign\n\t\t\t\t\tof Taurus, as it does once in the time of thirty years, they,\n\t\t\t\t\thaving been a long time preparing what is necessary for a\n\t\t\t\t\tsolemn sacrifice and a long voyage or navigation, send forth\n\t\t\t\t\tthose on whom the lots fall to row in that vast sea, and\n\t\t\t\t\tmake their abode for a great while in foreign countries.\n\t\t\t\t\tThese men then, being embarked and departed, meet with\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent adventures, some in one manner, others in another. Now such as have in safety passed the danger of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sea go first ashore in those opposite islands, which are\n\t\t\t\t\tinhabited by the Greeks, where they see that the sun is\n\t\t\t\t\tscarce hidden one full hour during the space of thirty\n\t\t\t\t\tdays, and that this is their night, of which the darkness is\n\t\t\t\t\tbut small, as having a twilight from the going down of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsun not unlike the dawning of the day; that having continued there ninety days, during which they are highly\n\t\t\t\t\tcaressed and honored, as being reputed and termed holy\n\t\t\t\t\tmen, they are afterwards conducted by the winds, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\ttransported into the isle of Saturn, where there are no\n\t\t\t\t\tother inhabitants but themselves and such as have been\n\t\t\t\t\tsent thither before them. For though it is lawful for\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, after they have served Saturn thirty years, to return\n\t\t\t\t\thome to their own countries and houses, yet most of them\n\t\t\t\t\tchoose rather to remain quietly there; some, because they\n\t\t\t\t\tare already accustomed to the place; others, because\n\t\t\t\t\twithout any labor and trouble they have abundance of all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, as well for the offering of sacrifices and holding\n\t\t\t\t\tfestival solemnities, as to support the ordinary expenses\n\t\t\t\t\tof those who are perpetually conversant in the study of\n\t\t\t\t\tlearning and philosophy. For they affirm the nature of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe island and the mildness of the air which environs\n\t\t\t\t\tit to be admirable; and that there have been some\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons who, intending to depart thence, have been hindered by the Divinity or Genius of the place showing\n\t\t\t\t\thimself to them, as to his familiar friends and acquaintance, not only in dreams and exterior signs, but also visibly\n\t\t\t\t\tappearing to them by the means of familiar spirits discoursing and conversing with them. For they say, that\n\t\t\t\t\tSaturn himself is personally there, lying asleep in the\n\t\t\t\t\tdeep cave of an hollow rock, shining like fine gold, Jupiter having prepared sleep instead of fetters and shackles\n\t\t\t\t\tto keep him from stirring; but that there are on the top\n\t\t\t\t\tof this rock certain birds, which fly down and carry him\n\t\t\t\t\tambrosia; that the whole island is filled with an admirable fragrancy and perfume, which is spread all over it,\n\t\t\t\t\tarising from this cave, as from an odoriferous fountain;\n\t\t\t\t\tthat these Daemons serve and minister to Saturn, having\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen his courtiers and nearest attendants when he held the\n\t\t\t\t\tempire and exercised regal authority over men and Gods;\n\t\t\t\t\tand that having the science of divining future occurrences,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey of themselves foretell many things; but the greatest\n\t\t\t\t\tand of the highest importance, when they return from assisting Saturn, and reveal his dreams; for whatever Jupiter\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t premeditates, Saturn dreams; but his awakenings are\n\t\t\t\t\tTitanical passions or perturbations of the soul in him,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich sleep altogether controls, in order that the royal\n\t\t\t\t\tand divine nature may be pure and incontaminate in itself."}, "This stranger then, having been brought thither, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthere serving the God in repose and at his ease, attained\n\t\t\t\t\tto as great skill in astrology as it is possible for any one to\n\t\t\t\t\tdo that has made the greatest progress in geometry; as for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rest of philosophy, having given himself to that which\n\t\t\t\t\tis called natural, he was seized with an extraordinary desire and longing to visit and see the great island; for so\n\t\t\t\t\tthey call the continent inhabited by us. After therefore\n\t\t\t\t\this thirty years were passed and his successors arrived,\n\t\t\t\t\thaving taken leave of all his relations and friends, he put\n\t\t\t\t\tto sea, in other respects soberly and moderately equipped,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut having good store of voyage-provision in vessels of\n\t\t\t\t\tgold.

Now he told me\n\t\t\t\t\tthat, of all the Gods which appear to us in heaven, we\n\t\t\t\t\tought chiefly to honor the Moon, and earnestly exhorted\n\t\t\t\t\tme to be diligent in venerating of her, as having the principal influence and dominion over our life."]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "27", "p": [{"pb": {"@id": "v.5.p.285"}, "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ko/rh"}, "quote": {"@rend": "blockquote", "lg": {"l": ["Into th' Elysian fields, earth's utmost bounds,", "The Gods will bring thee;"], "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Odyss.

For one, to wit\n\t\t\t\tCeres, is on the earth, and the lady and mistress of all\n\t\t\t\tearthly things. The other, to wit Proserpine, is in the\n\t\t\t\tmoon, and the mistress of all lunar things; and she is\n\t\t\t\tcalled both Cora and Persephone; Persephone, as being a\n\t\t\t\tbringer of light and brightness, and Cora, because the\n\t\t\t\tapple of the eye, in which the image of him who looks\n\t\t\t\tinto it is represented, as the brightness of the sun appears\n\t\t\t\tin the moon, is by the Greeks called .

But they are mistaken in thinking him to be\n\t\t\t\tcompounded of two parts only. For they imagine that the\n\t\t\t\tunderstanding is a part of the soul, but they err in this no\n\t\t\t\tless than those who make the soul to be a part of the\n\t\t\t\tbody; for the understanding as far exceeds the soul, as the\n\t\t\t\tsoul is better and diviner than the body. Now this composition of the soul with the understanding makes reason;\n\t\t\t\tand with the body, passion; of which the one is the beginning or principle of pleasure and pain, and the other\n\t\t\t\tof virtue and vice. Of those three parts conjoined and\n\t\t\t\tcompacted together, the earth has given the body, the moon\n\t\t\t\tthe soul, and the sun the understanding to the generation\n\t\t\t\tof man, . . . as therefore brightness to the moon. Now\n\t\t\t\tof the deaths we die, the one makes man two of three.\n\t\t\t\tand the other one of two. And the former indeed is in\n\t\t\t\tthe region and jurisdiction of Ceres, whence the name\n\t\t\t\tgiven to her mysteries () resembles that given to death\n\t\t\t\t(). The Athenians also heretofore called the deceased sacred to Ceres. As for the other death, it is in the\n\t\t\t\tmoon, or region of Proserpine.

This suddenly and with force and violence plucks\n\t\t\t\tthe soul from the body; but Proserpine mildly and in a\n\t\t\t\tlong time disjoins the understanding from the soul. And\n\t\t\t\tfor this reason is she called  that is, \n\t\t\t\tor rather,  for the better part of man\n\t\t\t\tbecomes alone when it is separated by her. Now both\n\t\t\t\tthe one and the other happens thus according to Nature.\n\t\t\t\tIt is ordained by Fate that every soul, whether with or\n\t\t\t\twithout understanding, when gone out of the body, should\n\t\t\t\twander for a time, though not all for the same, in the\n\t\t\t\tregion lying between the earth and the moon. For those\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tthat have been unjust and dissolute suffer there the punishments due to their offences; but the good and virtuous\n\t\t\t\tare there detained till they are purified, and have by expiation purged out of them all the infections they might\n\t\t\t\thave contracted from the contagion of the body, as if from.\n\t\t\t\tfoul breath, living in the mildest part of the air, called\n\t\t\t\tthe meadows of Pluto, where they must remain for a certain perfixed and appointed time.

And some who are\n\t\t\t\talready come thither, and yet take pleasure in things below, are seen descending down as it were into an abyss.\n\t\t\t\tBut those that are got on high, and are there securely\n\t\t\t\tseated, first go about as victors, crowned with garlands\n\t\t\t\tcalled the wings of constancy, because in their lives they\n\t\t\t\trestrained the unreasonable and passible part of their soul,\n\t\t\t\trendering it subject and obedient to the curb of reason.\n\t\t\t\tSecondly, they are like to the rays of the sun in appearance, and like to fire in their soul, which is borne aloft by\n\t\t\t\tthe clear air which is about the moon,like fire here on\n\t\t\t\tthe earth,from which they gather strength and solidity,\n\t\t\t\tas iron and steel do by their being tempered and plunged\n\t\t\t\tin water.

And of the\n\t\t\t\t\tthree fatal Goddesses or Parcae, she which is called Atropos\n\t\t\t\t\tis placed in the sun, and gives the principle of generation;\n\t\t\t\t\tand Clotho, being lodged in the moon, is she who joins,\n\t\t\t\t\tmingles, and unites; and the last, named Lachesis, is on\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthe earth, where she adds her helping hand, and with her\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes Fortune very much participate. For that which is\n\t\t\t\t\twithout a soul is weak in itself and liable to be affected by\n\t\t\t\t\tothers. The understanding is sovereign over all the rest,\n\t\t\t\t\tand cannot be made to suffer by any. Now the soul is a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain middle thing mixed of them both; as the moon\n\t\t\t\t\twas by God made and created a composition and mixture\n\t\t\t\t\tof things high and low, having the same proportion to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsun as the earth has to her."}, "This (said Sylla) is what I understood from this guest\n\t\t\t\t\tof mine, who was a stranger and a traveller; and this he\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid he learned from the Daemons who served and ministered to Saturn. And you, O Lamprias, may take my\n\t\t\t\t\trelation in such part as you please."]}]}}}}
