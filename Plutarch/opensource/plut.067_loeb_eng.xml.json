One may understand how\n\t\t\t\t\teffective and how productive a thing is application and hard work, if he\n\t\t\t\t\tonly direct his attention to many effects that are daily observed. For drops\n\t\t\t\t\tof water make hollows in rocks, steel and bronze are worn away by the touch\n\t\t\t\t\tof hands, and rims of chariot-wheels once bent by dint of labour, cannot, no\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter what be done, recover their original lines.

And are these the only\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which clearly show the potency of diligence? No, but myriads upon\n\t\t\t\t\tmyriads. A piece of land is good by nature, but without care it grows waste,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the better it is by nature, so much the more is it spoiled by neglect if\n\t\t\t\t\tit be not worked. Another piece is forbidding and rougher than land should\n\t\t\t\t\tbe, but, if it be tilled, straightway it produces noble crops.

On the other hand, what weak physique does not\n\t\t\t\t\tshow a very great improvement in strength if men exercise and train\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves? What horses if they are well broken when young do not become\n\t\t\t\t\tobedient to their riders, whereas if they are left unbroken they turn out\n\t\t\t\t\tstubborn and restive? Why wonder at other instances, seeing as we do that\n\t\t\t\t\tmany of the wildest animals are made tame and used to their labours?  Well did the Thessalian say, when asked who were the most\n\t\t\t\t\tpacific of the Thessalians,  But why discuss the matter at length ? For character is\n\t\t\t\t\thabit long continued, and if one were to call the virtues of character the\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtues of habit, he would not seem to go far astray. I will cite but one\n\t\t\t\t\tmore example on this point and then I shall desist from discussing it\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther. Lycurgus,  the lawgiver of the Spartans, took two\n\t\t\t\t\tpuppies of the same litter, and reared them in quite different ways, so that\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the one he produced a mischievous and greedy cur, and from the other a\n\t\t\t\t\tdog able to follow a scent and to hunt. And then at a time when the Spartans\n\t\t\t\t\twere gathered together, he said,  Thereupon producing the two dogs, he let them loose,\n\t\t\t\t\tputting down directly in front of them a dish of food and a hare. The one\n\t\t\t\t\tdog rushed after the hare, and the other made for the dish. While the\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartans were as yet unable to make out what import he gave to this, and\n\t\t\t\t\twith what intent he was exhibiting the dogs, he said,  In regard to habits and manner of life let this suffice."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "5", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.15"}, {"@id": "v1.p.17"}], "note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Ad fam."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Proceedings of Amer.

Mothers ought, I should say,\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves to feed their infants and nurse them themselves. For they will\n\t\t\t\t\tfeed them with a livelier affection and greater  care, as\n\t\t\t\t\tloving them inwardly, and, according to the proverb, to their finger-tips.\n\t\t\t\t\t But the goodwill of foster-mothers and nursemaids is\n\t\t\t\t\tinsincere and forced, since they love for pay. Nature too makes clear the\n\t\t\t\t\tfact that mothers should themselves nurse and feed what they have brought\n\t\t\t\t\tinto the world, since it is for this purpose that she has provided for every\n\t\t\t\t\tanimal which gives birth to young a source of food in its milk. Wise also is\n\t\t\t\t\ther forethought; for she has fashioned women's breasts double, so that, if\n\t\t\t\t\tthere be twins, they may have a double source of nutrition. Yet apart from\n\t\t\t\t\tall this, mothers would come to be more kindly disposed towards their\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren, and more inclined to show them affection. Not unnaturally either,\n\t\t\t\t\tI swear; for this fellowship in feeding is a bond that knits kindliness\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether. Yes, even the brute beasts, when dragged away from their\n\t\t\t\t\tcompanions in feeding, evidently miss them.  So, as I have said, mothers must\n\t\t\t\t\tendeavour, if possible, to nurse their children themselves; but if they are\n\t\t\t\t\tunable to do this, either because of bodily weakness (for such a thing can\n\t\t\t\t\thappen) or because they are in haste to bear more children, yet\n\t\t\t\t\tfoster-mothers and nursemaids are not to be selected at random, but as good\n\t\t\t\t\tones as possible must be chosen; and, first of all, in character they must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe Greek. For just as it is necessary, immediately after birth, to begin to\n\t\t\t\t\tmould the limbs of the children's bodies in order that these may grow\n\t\t\t\t\tstraight and without deformity, so, in the same fashion, it is fitting from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning to regulate the characters of children. For youth  is impressionable and plastic, and while such minds are\n\t\t\t\t\tstill tender lessons are infused deeply into them ; but anything which has\n\t\t\t\t\tbecome hard is with difficulty softened. For just as seals leave their\n\t\t\t\t\timpression in soft wax, so are lessons impressed upon the minds of children\n\t\t\t\t\twhile they are young. And, as it seems to me, Plato, that remarkable man,\n\t\t\t\t\tquite properly advises  nurses, even in telling stories to children, not to\n\t\t\t\t\tchoose at random, lest haply their minds be filled at the outset with\n\t\t\t\t\tfoolishness and corruption.

Teachers must be sought for the children who are free from\n\t\t\t\t\tscandal in their lives, who are unimpeachable in their manners, and in\n\t\t\t\t\texperience the very best that may be found. For to receive a proper\n\t\t\t\t\teducation is the source and root of all goodness. As husbandmen place stakes\n\t\t\t\t\tbeside the young plants, so do competent teachers with all care set their\n\t\t\t\t\tprecepts and exhortations beside the young, in order that their characters\n\t\t\t\t\tmay grow to be upright. Nowadays there are some fathers who deserve utter\n\t\t\t\t\tcontempt, who, before examining those who are going to teach, either because\n\t\t\t\t\tof ignorance, or sometimes because of inexperience, hand over their children\n\t\t\t\t\tto untried and untrustworthy men. And this is not so ridiculous if their\n\t\t\t\t\taction is due to inexperience, but there is another case which is absurd to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe last degree. What is this ? Why, sometimes even with knowledge and with\n\t\t\t\t\tinformation from others, who tell them of the inexperience and even of the\n\t\t\t\t\tdepravity of certain teachers, they nevertheless entrust their children to\n\t\t\t\t\tthem ; some yield to the flatteries of those who would please them, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are those who do it as a favour to insistent friends. Their action\n\t\t\t\t\tresembles that of a person, who, if he were afflicted with bodily disease,\n\t\t\t\t\t should reject that man who by his knowledge might be\n\t\t\t\t\table to save his life, and, as a favour to a friend, should prefer one who\n\t\t\t\t\tby his inexperience might cause his death ; or again that of a person who\n\t\t\t\t\tshould dismiss a most excellent shipmaster, and accept the very worst\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause of a friend's insistence. Heaven help us ! Does a man who bears the\n\t\t\t\t\tname of father think more of gratifying those who ask favours than he thinks\n\t\t\t\t\tof the education of his children ? And did not Socrates  of old often say\n\t\t\t\t\tvery fittingly, that if it were in any way possible one should go up to the\n\t\t\t\t\tloftiest part of the city and cry aloud, \n\t\t\t\t\tTo this I should like to add that such fathers act nearly as one would act\n\t\t\t\t\twho should give thought to his shoe but pay no regard to his foot. Many\n\t\t\t\t\tfathers, however, go so far in their devotion to money as well as in\n\t\t\t\t\tanimosity toward their children, that in order to avoid paying a larger fee,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey select as teachers for their children men who are not worth any wage at\n\t\t\t\t\tall\u2014looking for ignorance, which is cheap enough.

But if these men had become conversant with the higher\n\t\t\t\t\teducation, they perhaps would not have allowed themselves to be dominated by\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch practices, and they would at least have become acquainted with the\n\t\t\t\t\tprecept  of Diogenes, who with coarseness of speech, but with substantial\n\t\t\t\t\ttruth, advises and says,"}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "8", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "v1.p.25"}, {"@id": "v1.p.27"}], "q": [{"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "No, indeed, for war cannot make spoil of virtue."}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "I do not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow how he stands in the matter of righteousness and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlearning,"}], "note": {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Gorgias"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cf."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Tusculan Disputations"}], "#text": "Plato, , 470 E;  Cicero, , v. 12."}, "#text": "Briefly, then, I say (an oracle one might properly \n\t\t\t\t\t call it, rather than advice) that, to sum up, the\n\t\t\t\t\tbeginning, the middle, and end in all these matters is good education and\n\t\t\t\t\tproper training ; and it is this, I say, which leads on and helps towards\n\t\t\t\t\tmoral excellence and towards happiness. And, in comparison with this, all\n\t\t\t\t\tother advantages are human, and trivial, and not worth our serious concern.\n\t\t\t\t\tGood birth is a fine thing, but it is an advantage which must be credited to\n\t\t\t\t\tone's ancestors. Wealth is held in esteem, but it is a chattel of fortune,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince oftentime she takes it away from those who possess it, and brings and\n\t\t\t\t\tpresents it to those who do not expect it.

Repute,\n\t\t\t\t\tmoreover, is imposing, but unstable. Beauty is highly prized, but\n\t\t\t\t\tshort-lived. Health is a valued possession, but inconstant. Strength is much\n\t\t\t\t\tadmired, but it falls an easy prey to disease and old age. And, in general,\n\t\t\t\t\tif anybody prides himself wholly upon the strength of his body, let him know\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he is sadly mistaken in judgement. For how small is man's strength\n\t\t\t\t\tcompared with the power of other living creatures! I mean, for instance,\n\t\t\t\t\telephants and bulls and lions. But learning, of all things in this world, is\n\t\t\t\t\talone immortal and divine. Two elements in man's nature are supreme over\n\t\t\t\t\tall\u2014mind and reason. The mind exercises control over reason, and reason is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe servant of the mind, unassailable by fortune, impregnable to calumny,\n\t\t\t\t\tuncorrupted by disease, unimpaired by old age. For the mind alone grows\n\t\t\t\t\tyoung with increase of years, and time, which takes away all things else,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut adds wisdom  to old age.

It seems to me that Stilpo, the\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosopher of Megara, made an answer worth recording, at the time when\n\t\t\t\t\tDemetrius, having reduced the people of that city to slavery and razed its\n\t\t\t\t\tbuildings, asked him whether perchance he had lost anything ; but Stilpo\n\t\t\t\t\treplied : \n\t\t\t\t\tIn full accord and harmony with this appears the reply of Socrates.

For to please\n\t\t\t\t\tthe multitude is to displease the wise. And Euripides bears witness to my\n\t\t\t\t\twords when he says :  \n                I observe that those who\n\t\t\t\t\tpractise speaking in a way to catch the favour of the vulgar herd also turn\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t out in general to be incontinent in their lives and fond\n\t\t\t\t\tof pleasure.

Moreover, why should children [be taught such a\n\t\t\t\t\tway of speaking] ?  For it is a good thing not to say or do anything at\n\t\t\t\t\trandom, and according to the proverb,  \n               \n\t\t\t\t\tSpeeches made offhand display a large measure of readiness and facility,\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing characteristic of persons who know not where should be the beginning\n\t\t\t\t\tor where the end. But, apart from all other errors, those who speak on the\n\t\t\t\t\timpulse of the moment fall into a dreadful disregard of limit and into\n\t\t\t\t\tloquacity. Reflexion on the other hand prevents a discourse from exceeding\n\t\t\t\t\tthe due limits of proportion. Pericles,  \n                though called upon by the people,\n\t\t\t\t\toftentimes did not heed their summons, saying that he was unprepared.  In\n\t\t\t\t\tlike manner also Demosthenes, who was an ardent follower of Pericles'\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical policy, when the Athenians called upon him to give his counsel,\n\t\t\t\t\tresisted, saying,  This, perhaps,\n\t\t\t\t\tis an unauthentic and fictitious tradition; but in his speech against\n\t\t\t\t\tMeidias  he presents clearly the helpfulness of reflection. At any rate he\n\t\t\t\t\tsays,  But I, for my part, would not assert that readiness of\n\t\t\t\t\tspeech is to be utterly rejected, or again that it should not be used in its\n\t\t\t\t\tproper place, but that it is to be used like a drug, with caution. Indeed\n\t\t\t\t\tuntil one arrives at man's estate I do not think it right that he should\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak at all offhand, but when he shall have firmly established his powers,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, if the occasion invite, it is fitting for him to exercise some freedom\n\t\t\t\t\tin his speech. For just as those who have been in fetters for a long time,\n\t\t\t\t\teven if later they be set free, yet, because of the long-continued\n\t\t\t\t\thabituation to their bonds, are not able to walk freely, and are not sure on\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir feet, so is it with those who for a long time have kept their speech\n\t\t\t\t\tunder close restraint : if ever it becomes necessary to speak offhand, they\n\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless keep to the same type of expression as before. But to allow\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who are still young to speak extempore stands responsible for the\n\t\t\t\t\tworst sort of rambling talk.

I can perhaps make my\n\t\t\t\t\topinion clear by means of a figure : for example, it is a fine thing to\n\t\t\t\t\tvoyage about and view many cities, but profitable to dwell  only in the best one. And it was a clever saying of Bion, the\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosopher, that, just as the suitors, not being able to approach Penelope,\n\t\t\t\t\tconsorted with her maid-servants, so also do those who are not able to\n\t\t\t\t\tattain to philosophy wear themselves to a shadow over the other kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\teducation which have no value. Wherefore it is necessary to make philosophy\n\t\t\t\t\tas it were the head and front of all education. For as regards the care of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe body men have discovered two sciences, the medical and the gymnastic, of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the one implants health, the other sturdiness, in the body ; but for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe illnesses and affections of the mind philosophy alone is the remedy. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough philosophy and in company with philosophy it is possible to attain\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge of what is honourable and what is shameful, what is just and what\n\t\t\t\t\tis unjust, what, in brief, is to be chosen and what to be avoided, how a man\n\t\t\t\t\tmust bear himself in his relations with the gods, with his parents, with his\n\t\t\t\t\telders, with the laws, with strangers, with those in authority, with\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends, with women, with children, with servants ; that one ought to\n\t\t\t\t\treverence the gods, to honour one's parents, to respect ones elders, to be\n\t\t\t\t\tobedient to the laws, to yield to those in authority, to love one's friends,\n\t\t\t\t\tto be chaste with women, to be affectionate with children, and not to be\n\t\t\t\t\toverbearing with slaves; and, most important of all, not to be over joyful\n\t\t\t\t\tat success or overmuch distressed at misfortune, nor to be dissolute in\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasures, nor impulsive and brutish in temper. These things I regard as\n\t\t\t\t\tpre-eminent among all the advantages which accrue from philosophy. For to\n\t\t\t\t\thave a generous heart in prosperity shows a man, to excite no envy withal\n\t\t\t\t\tshows  a disciplined nature ; to rule pleasure by reason\n\t\t\t\t\tmarks the wise man, and not every man can master his passion. But I regard\n\t\t\t\t\tas perfect, so far as men can be, those who are able to combine and mingle\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical capacity with philosophy ; and I am inclined to think that these\n\t\t\t\t\tare secure in the possession of two things which are of the greatest good: a\n\t\t\t\t\tlife useful to the world in their public position, and the calm and\n\t\t\t\t\tuntroubled life in their pursuit of philosophy. For there are three forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tlife, of which the first is the practical life, the second the contemplative\n\t\t\t\t\tlife, and the third the life of enjoyment. The last, which is dissolute and\n\t\t\t\t\tenslaved to pleasure, is bestial and mean, but the contemplative life, which\n\t\t\t\t\tfalls short in practice, is not useful, while the practical life which has\n\t\t\t\t\tno portion in philosophy, is without culture or taste. One must try, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tas well as one can, both to take part in public life, and to lay hold of\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy so far as the opportunity is granted. Such was the life of\n\t\t\t\t\tPericles as a public man, such was Archytas of Tarentum, such was Dion of\n\t\t\t\t\tSyracuse, such was Epaminondas of Thebes, of whom the next to the last was\n\t\t\t\t\tthe associate of Plato."}, "In regard to education I do not know why it is necessary to take the time to\n\t\t\t\t\tsay more ; but in addition to the foregoing, it is useful, or rather it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary, not to be indifferent about acquiring the works of earlier\n\t\t\t\t\twriters, but to make a collection of these, like a set of tools in farming.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the corresponding tool of education is the use of books, and by their\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans it has come to pass that we are able to study knowledge at its source."]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "11", "p": [{"pb": {"@id": "v1.p.39"}, "note": [{"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Republic"}, "#text": ", 537 B."}, {"@place": "unspecified", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cyropaedia"}, "#text": "Xenophon, , ii. 3. 2."}], "q": [{"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "For the goods of the vanquished"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "are prizes offered to the victors."}], "#text": "It is not proper, either, to overlook the exercise  of the\n\t\t\t\t\tbody, but we should send the children to the trainer's and cultivate\n\t\t\t\t\tadequately this side of education with all diligence, not merely for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsake of gracefulness of body but also with an eye to strength ; for\n\t\t\t\t\tsturdiness of body in childhood is the foundation of a hale old age.

And this is the reason, as it\n\t\t\t\t\tappears to me, why the men of olden time established the rites of initiation\n\t\t\t\t\tinto the mysteries, that we, by becoming accustomed to keep silence there,\n\t\t\t\t\tmay transfer that fear which we learned from the divine secrets to the safe\n\t\t\t\t\tkeeping of the secrets of men. For, again, nobody was ever sorry because he\n\t\t\t\t\tkept silent, but hundreds because they talked. Again, the word unspoken can\n\t\t\t\t\teasily be uttered later; but the spoken word cannot possibly be recalled.

A story to match and couple with this, and much more dreadful, is\n\t\t\t\t\twhat the sophist Theocritus said and suffered. Alexander \n\t\t\t\t\t had bidden the Greeks to make ready crimson robes so that\n\t\t\t\t\ton his return he might offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving for his victory in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe war against the barbarians, and all the states had to pay a polltax in\n\t\t\t\t\tmoney, when Theocritus remarked,  \n                And thereby he made an enemy of Alexander. And Antigonus, king of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Macedonians, who was blind of one eye, he drove to immoderate anger by\n\t\t\t\t\treproaching him with his disfigurement. For Antigonus sent his chief cook,\n\t\t\t\t\tEutropion, who had been an officer in his army, to Theocritus, and insisted\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Theocritus should come to him and engage him in discussion. When\n\t\t\t\t\tEutropion delivered his message to Theocritus, coming several times for the\n\t\t\t\t\tpurpose, the latter said,  twitting the one for being disfigured\n\t\t\t\t\tand the other for being now a cook.  said Eutropion,  He thereupon\n\t\t\t\t\treported the remark to the king, who sent and had Theocritus put to death."}, "But besides all this, we should, as a most sacred duty, accustom children to\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak the truth.

Still\n\t\t\t\t\tI must venture to speak of it. What is it then ? It is the question whether\n\t\t\t\t\tboys' admirers are to be permitted to associate with them and pass their\n\t\t\t\t\ttime with them, or whether, on the contrary, they should be kept away and\n\t\t\t\t\tdriven off from association with the youth.

Euripides  gives testimony in\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir favour when he says : Among mankind another love exists, That of an\n\t\t\t\t\tupright, chaste, and noble soul. Nor may we omit the remark of Plato \n\t\t\t\t\twherein jest and seriousness are combined. For he says that those who have\n\t\t\t\t\tacquitted themselves nobly ought to have the right to kiss any fair one they\n\t\t\t\t\tplease. Now we ought indeed to drive away those whose desire is for mere\n\t\t\t\t\toutward beauty, but to admit without reserve those who are lovers of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsoul. And while the sort of love prevailing at Thebes and in Elis is to be\n\t\t\t\t\tavoided, as well as the so-called \n\t\t\t\t\t kidnapping in Crete, that which is found at Athens and in\n\t\t\t\t\tLacedaemon is to be emulated."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "16", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "v1.p.59"}, "#text": "In this matter each man may be allowed such opinion as accords with his own\n\t\t\t\t\tconvictions. But now that I have spoken of the orderly and decorous\n\t\t\t\t\tbehaviour of children, I shall next pass to the period of adolescence, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsay a very few words about it. I have often expressed my utter\n\t\t\t\t\tdisapprobation of men who have been responsible for the introduction of\n\t\t\t\t\tdepraved habits. For, while it is true that they have put attendants and\n\t\t\t\t\tteachers in charge of their children, they nevertheless have allowed the\n\t\t\t\t\timpetuosity of youth to range unrestrained, when they ought, on the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary, to have exercised greater caution and watchfulness over them when\n\t\t\t\t\tthey were young men than when they were children. For who is not aware that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe faults of children are trivial and altogether corrigible \u2014heedlessness,\n\t\t\t\t\tperhaps, towards their attendants, or deceiving and refusing to mind their\n\t\t\t\t\tteachers ?

The impulses of young men should therefore be kept fettered and\n\t\t\t\t\trestrained by careful supervision. For life's prime is prodigal in its\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasures, restive, and in need of a curb, so that parents who do not take\n\t\t\t\t\thold of the reins with firm hand at this period of life, are manifestly, by\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir folly, giving to their sons licence for wrongdoing. Wise fathers\n\t\t\t\t\tought, therefore, especially during this time, to be vigilant and alert, and\n\t\t\t\t\tto bring the young men to reason by instruction, by threats,  by entreaties, by pointing out examples of men who\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough love of pleasure have become involved in misfortunes, and of those\n\t\t\t\t\twho, through their steadfastness, have gained for themselves approval and\n\t\t\t\t\tgood repute. For these two things\u2014hope of reward and fear of punishment\u2014are,\n\t\t\t\t\tas it were, the elements of virtue.

Detestable is their whole tribe, pretenders of\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship, without a vestige of honest speech, flatterers of the rich but\n\t\t\t\t\tdespisers of the poor, addressing themselves with instinctive art to the\n\t\t\t\t\tyoung, grinning broadly when their patrons laugh, spurious claimants to any\n\t\t\t\t\tspirit, and bastard members of human life, subsisting at the beck and nod of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe wealthy ; free-born by freak of fortune, but slaves by choice.

Take the fathers again : I do not think they should be utterly\n\t\t\t\t\tharsh and austere in their nature, but they should in many cases concede\n\t\t\t\t\tsome shortcomings to the younger person, and remind themselves that they\n\t\t\t\t\tonce were young. As physicians, by mixing bitter drugs with sweet syrups,\n\t\t\t\t\thave  found that the agreeable taste gains access for what\n\t\t\t\t\tis beneficial, so fathers should combine the abruptness of their rebukes\n\t\t\t\t\twith mildness, and at one time grant some licence to the desires of their\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren, and slacken the reins a little, and then at another time draw them\n\t\t\t\t\ttight again. Most desirable is it that they should bear misdeeds with\n\t\t\t\t\tserenity, but if that be impossible, yet, if they be on occasion angered,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey should quickly cool down. For it is better that a father should be\n\t\t\t\t\tquick-tempered than sullen, since a hostile and irreconcilable spirit is no\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall proof of animosity towards one's children. It is a good thing also to\n\t\t\t\t\tpretend not to know of some shortcomings, and to turn the old man's dull eye\n\t\t\t\t\tand dull ear to what they do, and seeing, not to see, and, hearing, not to\n\t\t\t\t\thear, sometimes, what goes on.
