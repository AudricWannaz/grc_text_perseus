As to her eating a seed or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tseeds of a pomegranate, see , ; ; ;  and ; ; .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is a widespread belief that if a living person visits the world of the dead and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere partakes of food, he cannot return to the land of the living. Thus, the ancient\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEgyptians believed that, on his way to the spirit land, the soul of a dead person was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmet by a goddess Hathor, Nouit, or Nit, who offered him fruits,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbread, and water, and that, if he accepted them, he could return to earth no more. See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. Similarly, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnatives of , in the South Pacific,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsay that when a man dies, messengers come from the other world to guide his soul through\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe air and over the sea to the spirit land. Arrived there, he is welcomed by the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsouls and bidden to a banquet, where he is offered food, especially bananas. If he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttastes them, his doom is fixed for ever: he cannot return to earth. See the missionary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The Eastern Melanesians believe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat living people can go down to the land of the dead and return alive to the upper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tworld. Persons who have done so relate how in the nether world they were warned by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfriendly ghosts to eat nothing there. See . Similar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeliefs prevail and similar tales are told among the Maoris of . For example, a woman who believed that she\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad died and passed to the spirit land, related on her return how there she met with her\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdead father, who said to her, You must go back to the earth, for there is no\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone now left to take care of my grandchild. But remember, if you once eat food in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplace, you can never more return to life; so beware not to taste anything offered to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyou. See . Again, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttell of a great chief named Hutu, who performed the same perilous journey. On reaching\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe place of departed spirits he encountered a certain being called Hine nui te po, that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis, Great Mother Night, of whom he inquired the way down to the nether world. She\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpointed it out to him and gave him a basket of cooked food, saying, When you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treach the lower regions, eat sparingly of your provisions that they may last, and you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmay not be compelled to partake of their food, for if you do, you cannot return upwards\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagain. See . And\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same rule holds good of fairyland, into which living people sometimes stray or are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenticed to their sorrow. Wise people recommend that, in the circumstances, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tman should not utter a word till he comes out again, nor, on any account, taste fairy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfood or drink. If he abstains he is very likely before long dismissed, but if he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindulges he straightway loses the will and the power ever to return to the society of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmen. See .

They\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere born, as some say, in Phlegrae, but according to others in . And they darted rocks and burning oaks at the sky. Surpassing all the rest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere Porphyrion and Alcyoneus, who was even immortal so long as he fought in the land of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\this birth. He also drove away the cows of the Sun from Erythia. Now the gods had an oracle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat none of the giants could perish at the hand of gods, but that with the help of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmortal they would be made an end of. Learning of this, Earth sought for a simple to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprevent the giants from being destroyed even bya mortal. But Zeus forbade the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDawn and the Moon and the Sun to shine, and then, before anybody else could get it, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tculled the simple himself, and by means of Athena summoned Hercules to his help. Hercules\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst shot Alcyoneus with an arrow, but when the giant fell on the ground he somewhat\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevived. However, at Athena's advice Hercules dragged him outside , and so the giant died.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t But in the battle Porphyrion attacked Hercules and Hera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless Zeus inspired him with lust for Hera, and when he tore her robes and would\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave forced her, she called for help, and Zeus smote him with a thunderbolt, and Hercules\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshot him dead with an arrow. As for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other giants, Ephialtes was shot by Apollo with an arrow in his left eye and by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHercules in his right; Eurytus was killed by Dionysus with a thyrsus, and Clytius by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHecate with torches, and Mimas by Hephaestus with missiles of red-hot metal. Enceladus fled, but Athena threw on him in his flight the island of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; and she\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflayed Pallas and used his skin to shield her own body inthe fight. Polybotes was chased through the sea by Poseidon and came to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCos; and Poseidon, breaking off that piece of the island which is called Nisyrum, threw it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton him. And Hermes, wearing the helmet of Hades, slew Hippolytus in the fight, and Artemis slew Gration. And the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFates, fighting with brazer clubs, killed Agrius and Thoas.

As far as the thighs he was of human\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshape and of such prodigious bulk that he out-topped all the mountains, and his head often\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbrushed the stars. One of his hands reached out to the west and the other to the east, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfromthem projected a hundred dragons' heads. From the thighs downward he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thuge coils of vipers, which when drawn out, reached to his very head and emitted a loud\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thissing. His body was all winged:unkempt hair streamed on the wind from his head and cheeks; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfire flashed from his eyes. Such and so great was Typhon when, hurling kindled rocks, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmade for the very heaven with hissings and shouts, spouting a great jet of fire from his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmouth. But when the gods saw him rushing at heaven, they made for  in flight, and being pursued they changed their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforms into those of animals. However Zeus pelted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTyphon at a distance with thunderbolts, and at close quarters struck him down with an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadamantine sickle, and as he fled pursued him closely as far as Mount Casius, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toverhangs . There, seeing the monster sore\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twounded, he grappled with him. But Typhon twined about him and gripped him in his coils,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand wresting the sickle from him severed the sinews of his hands and feet, and lifting him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton his shoulders carried him through the sea to  and deposited him on arrival in the Corycian cave. Likewise he put\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taway the sinews there also, hidden in a bearskin, and he set to guard them the she-dragon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDelphyne, who was a half-bestial maiden. But Hermes and Aegipan stole the sinewsand fitted them unobserved to Zeus. And having recovered his strength Zeus suddenly from heaven, riding in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchariot of winged horses, pelted Typhon with thunderbolts and pursued him to the mountain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled , where the Fates beguiled the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfugitive; for he tasted of the ephemeral fruits in the persuasion that he would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrengthened thereby.

But when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese recoiled on him through the force of the thunderbolt, a stream of blood gushed out\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the mountain, and they say that from that circumstance the mountain was called\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. And when he started to flee\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the Sicilian sea, Zeus cast  in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t upon him.

See Frazer's Appendix to Apollodorus, Myths of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOrigin of Fire. The plant  in which Prometheus is said to have carried the stolen fire\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis commonly identified with the giant fennel Ferula communis. See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. Tournefort found the plant growing abundantly in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSkinosa, the ancient Schinussa, a small deserted island south of  . He describes the stalk as about five feet high and three inches\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthick, with knots and branches at intervals of about ten inches, the whole being covered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith a tolerably hard rind. This stalk is filled with a white pith, which,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing very dry, catches fire just like a wick; the fire keeps alight perfectly in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstalk and consumes the pith only gradually, without damaging the rind; hence people use\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis plant to carry fire from one place to another; our sailors laid in a supply of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis custom is of great antiquity, and may serve to explain a passage in Hesiod, who,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspeaking of the fire which Prometheus stole from heaven, says that he carried it away in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta stalk of fennel. He tells us, further, that the Greeks still call the plant\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnartheca. See . The plant is common all over\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, and may be seen in particular\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabundance at Phalerum, near . See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. In  Mr. J. T.

On hearing that, Althaea snatched up the brand and deposited it in a chest. Meleager grew up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be an invulnerable and gallant man, but came by his end in the following way. In\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsacrificing the first fruits ofthe annual crops of the country to all the gods\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOeneus forgot Artemis alone. But she in her wrath sent a boar of extraordinary size and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength, which prevented the land from being sown and destroyed the cattle and the people\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat fell in with it. To attack this boar Oeneus called together all the noblest men of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, and promised that to him who should\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkill the beast he would give the skin as a prize. Now the men who assembled to hunt the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tboar were these: Meleager, son of Oeneus; Dryas, son of Ares; these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcame from Calydon; Idas and Lynceus, sons of Aphareus, from ; Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus and Leda,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom ; Theseus, son of Aegeus, from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; Admetus, son of Pheres, from Pherae;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAncaeus and Cepheus, sons of Lycurgus, from ; Jason, son of Aeson, from Iolcus; Iphicles, son of Amphitryon, from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; Pirithous, son of Ixion, from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLarissa; Peleus, son of Aeacus, from ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTelamon, son of Aeacus, from ; Eurytion,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tson of Actor, from ; Atalanta, daughter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Schoeneus, from ; Amphiaraus, son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOicles, from .

When Jason swore to do so, she gave him a drug\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith which she bade him anoint his shield, spear, and body when he was about to yoke the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbulls; for she said that, anointed with it, he could for a single day be harmed neither by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfire nor by iron. And she signified to him that, when the teeth were sown, armed men would\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspring up from the ground against him; and when he saw a knot of them he was to throw\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstones into their midst from a distance, and when they fought each other about that, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas taken to kill them. On hearing that, Jason anointed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thimself with the drug, and being come to the grove of the temple he sought the bulls, and though they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcharged him with a flame of fire, he yoked them. And when he had sowed the teeth, there rose armed men from the ground; and where\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\the saw several together, he pelted them unseen with stones, and when they fought each\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother he drew near and slew them. But though the bullswere yoked, Aeetes did\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot give the fleece; for he wished to burn down the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArgo and kill the crew. But before he could do so, Medea brought Jason by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnight to the fleece, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshe possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason's company came to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArgo.

He\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstated that all the women of his settlement were frequently seized by a kind of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmadnesspresumably some form of hysteria and that they ran off\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsinging into the jungle, each woman by herself, and stopped there for several days and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnights, finally returning almost naked, or with their clothes all torn to shreds. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid that the first outbreak of this kind occurred a few years ago, and that they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstill frequent, one usually taking place every two or three months.

The chest was washed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tashore on Seriphus, and Dictys took up the boy and reared him.  Polydectes, brother of Dictys, was then king of Seriphus and fell in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlove with Danae, but could not get access to her, because Perseus was grown to man's\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\testate.

Now Perseus having declared that he would not stick even at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGorgon's head, Polydectes required the others to furnish horses, and not getting horses\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Perseus ordered him to bring the Gorgon's head.

The three had but one eye and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonetooth, and these they passed to each other in turn. Perseus got\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpossession of the eye and the tooth, and when they asked them back, he said he would give\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem up if they would show him the way to the nymphs.

When the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhorcides had shown him the way, he gave them back the tooth and the eye, and coming to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe nymphs got what he wanted. So he slung the wallet  about him, fitted the sandals to his ankles, and put the cap on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\this head. Wearing it, he saw whom he pleased, but was not seen by others.

He owned red kine, of which Eurytion was the herdsman and Orthus, the two-headed hound, begotten by Typhon on Echidna,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas the watchdog. So journeying through  to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfetch the kine of Geryon he destroyed many wild beasts and set foot in , and proceeding to Tartessus he erected\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas tokens of his journey two pillars over against eachother at the boundaries\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof  and . But being heated by the Sun on his journey, he bent his bow at the god,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho in admiration of his hardihood, gave him a golden goblet in which he crossed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tocean. And having reached Erythia he lodged on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMount Abas. However the dog, perceiving him, rushed at him; but he smote it with his club,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tandwhen the herdsman Eurytion came to the help of the dog, Hercules killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim also. But Menoetes, who was there pasturing the kine of Hades, reported to Geryon what\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad occurred, and he, coming up with Hercules beside the river Anthemus, as he was driving away the kine, joined battle with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim and was shot dead.

It is possible that the period refers to the eight years' cycle, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfigured prominently in the religious calendar of the ancient Greeks; for example, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPythian games were originally held at intervals of eight years. See ; . It is to be remembered that the period of service performed by Herakles for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEurystheus was an expiation for the murder of his children see . Now Cadmus is said to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tserved Ares for eight years as an expiation for the slaughter of the dragon, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toffspring of Ares see . But in those days, we are told, the eternal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyear comprised eight common years . Now Apollo served Admetus for a year as an expiation for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslaughter of the Cyclopes ; but according to , the period of Apollo's service was not one but nine years. In making this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstatement Servius, or his authority, probably had before him a Greek author, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmentioned an  as the period of Apollo's\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tservice. But though  means literally\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnine years, the period, in consequence of the Greek mode of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treckoning, was actually equivalent to eight years compare , . These legends about the servitude of Cadmus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApollo, and Herakles for eight years, render it probable that in ancient times Greek\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thomicides were banished for eight years, and had during that time to do penance by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tserving a foreigner. Now this period of eight years was called a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyear , and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod of banishment for a homicide was regularly a year. See ; , ; ; ; . Hence it seems probable that, though in later times\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe period of a homicide's banishment was a single ordinary year, it may formerly have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen a great year, or period of eight ordinary years. It deserves\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be noted that any god who had forsworn himself by the Styx had to expiate his fault\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby silence and fasting for a full year, after which he was banished the company of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgods for nine years ; and further that any man who partook of human flesh in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trites of Lycaean Zeus was supposed to be turned into a wolf for nine years. See ; ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. These notions point to a nine years'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod of expiation, which may have been observed in some places instead of the eight\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyears' period. In the present passage of Apollodorus, the addition of a month to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teight years' period creates a difficulty which I am unable to explain. Ancient\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmathematicians defined a great year as the period at the end of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich the sun, moon, and planets again occupy the same positions relatively to each\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother which they occupied at the beginning; but on the length of the period opinions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere much divided. See  Different,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapparently, from the great year was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevolving \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor mundane  year, which was the period at the end of which, not only\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sun, moon, and planets, but also the so-called fixed stars again occupy the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpositions relatively to each other which they occupied at the beginning; for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tancients recognized that the so-called fixed stars do move, though their motion is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\timperceptible to our senses. The length of a revolving or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmundane year was calculated by ancient physicists at fifteen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthousand years.

Ovid, with his Scholiasts, Hyginus and Philargyrius, like Apollodorus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tallege a nine or eight years' dearth or drought as the cause of the human sacrifices\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinstituted by Busiris. Their account may be derived from Pherecydes, who is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tauthority cited by the .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t adds that the seer Phrasius, who advised the sacrifice,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas a brother of Pygmalion. Herodotus, without mentioning Busiris, scouts the story on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ground that human sacrifices were utterly alien to the spirit of Egyptian religion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. Isocrates also discredited\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tradition, in so far as it relates to Herakles, because Herakles was four\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerations younger, and Busiris more than two hundred years older, than Perseus. See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. Yet there are grounds for thinking that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGreek tradition was substantially correct. For Manetho, our highest ancient authority,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdefinitely affirmed that in the city of Ilithyia it was customary to burn alive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTyphonian men and to scatter their ashes by means of winnowing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfans . These\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTyphonian men were red-haired, because Typhon, the Egyptian\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tembodiment of evil, was also redhaired . But redhaired men would commonly be foreigners, in contrast to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblack-haired natives of ; and it was just\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforeigners who, according to Greek tradition, were chosen as victims. Diodorus Siculus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints this out  in confirmation of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGreek tradition, and he tells us that the redhaired men were sacrificed at the grave of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOsiris, though this statement may be an inference from his etymology of the name\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiris, which he explains to mean grave of Osiris. The etymology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis correct, Busiris being a Greek rendering of the Egyptian Asir place of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOsiris. See . Porphyry informs us, on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tauthority of Manetho, that the Egyptian custom of sacrificing human beings at the City\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Sun was suppressed by Amosis Amasis, who ordered waxen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teffigies to be substituted for the victims. He adds that the human victims used to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texamined just like calves for the sacrifice, and that they were sealed in token of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfitness for the altar. See . Sextus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmpiricus even speaks of human sacrifices in  as if they were practised down to his own time, which was about 200\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA.D. See . Seleucus wrote a special\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttreatise on human sacrifices in \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. In view of these facts,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Greek tradition that the sacrifices were offered in order to restore the fertility\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the land or to procure rain after a long drought, and that on one occasion the king\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thimself was the victim, may be not without significance. For kings or chiefs have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toften sacrificed under similar circumstances see ; ; ; and in ancient  the rulers are definitely said to have been held responsible for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfailure of the crops ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thence it would not be surprising if in extreme cases they were put to death.

See ;  Different versions of the story were current among ancient\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twriters and illustrated by ancient artists. See . One of these versions, which I omitted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto notice in that place, ran as follows. On a visit to , king Aleus of  was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twarned by the oracle that his daughter would bear a son who would kill his maternal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuncles, the sons of Aleus. To guard against this catastrophe, Aleus hurried home and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappointed his daughter priestess of Athena, declaring that, should she prove unchaste,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the would put her to death. As chance would have it, Herakles arrived at  on his way to , where he purposed to make war on Augeas. The king entertained him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thospitably in the sanctuary of Athena, and there the hero, flushed with wine, violated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe maiden priestess. Learning that she was with child, her father Aleus sent for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texperienced ferryman Nauplius, father of Palamedes, and entrusted his daughter to him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttake and drown her. On their way to the sea the girl Auge gave birth\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto Telephus on Mount Parthenius, and instead of drowning her and the infant the ferryman\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsold them both to king Teuthras in , who,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing childless, married Auge and adopted Telephus. See  appended to his edition of Antiphon. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tversion, which represents mother and child as sold together to Teuthras, differs from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe version adopted by Apollodorus, according to whom Auge alone was sold to Teuthras in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, while her infant son Telephus was left\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbehind in  and reared by herdsmen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. The sons of Aleus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand maternal uncles of Telephus were Cepheus and Lycurgus . Ancient writers do not tell us how\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTelephus fulfilled the oracle by killing them, though the murder is mentioned by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t and a Greek proverb-writer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. Sophocles appears to have told the story in his lost play,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; for in it he described how Telephus came, silent and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspeechless, from  to  , and this silence of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTelephus seems to have been proverbial. For the comic poet Alexis, speaking of a greedy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparasite who used to gobble up his dinner without exchanging a word with anybody, says\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, he dines like speechless Telephus, answering all questions put to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly with nods . And\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanother comic poet, Amphis, describing the high and mighty airs with which fish-mongers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttreated their customers in the market, says that it was a thousand times easier to get\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspeech of a general than of a fish-monger; for if you addressed one of these gentry and,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpointing to a fish, asked How much? he would not at first deign to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlook at you, much less speak to you, but would stoop down, silent as Telephus, over his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twares; though in time, his desire of lucre overcoming his contempt of you, he would slap\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta bloated octopus and mutter meditatively, as if soliloquizing,  Sixpence for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim, and a bob for the hammerfish. This latter poet explains incidentally why\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTelephus was silent; he says it was very natural that fish-mongers should hold their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttongue, for all homicides are in the same case, thus at once\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinforming us of a curious point in Greek law or custom and gratifying his spite at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcursed fish-mongers, whom he compares to the worst class of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcriminals. See . As Greek homicides were supposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be haunted by the ghosts of their victims until a ceremony of purification was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperformed which rid them of their invisible, but dangerous, pursuers, we may conjecture\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the rule of silence had to be observed by them until the accomplishment of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpurificatory rite released them from the restrictions under which they laboured during\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir uncleanness, and permitted them once more to associate freely with their fellows.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs to the restrictions imposed on homicides in ancient , see ; \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe motive of the homicide's silence may have been a fear lest by speaking he should\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tattract the attention, and draw down on himself the vengeance, of his victim's ghost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSimilarly, among certain peoples, a widow is bound to observe silence for some time\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tafter her husband's death, and the rule appears to be based on a like dread of exciting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe angry or amorous passions of her departed spouse by the sound of the familiar voice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSee"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "qhlh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)/lafos"}], "#text": "Apollodorus seems to derive the name Telephus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom , a dug, and , a doe."}], "pb": [{"@n": "255"}, {"@n": "257"}], "milestone": {"@n": "5", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "Passing by ,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHercules debauched Auge, not knowing her to be a daughter of Aleus.

According to , the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttomb of Eurystheus was near the Scironian Rocks, where he had been killed by Iolaus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot Hyllus as he was fleeing home after the battle. According to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEuripides, he was captured by Iolaus at the Scironian Rocks and carried a prisoner to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlcmena, who ordered him to execution, although the Athenians interceded for his life;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand his body was buried before the sanctuary of Athena at , an Attic township situated between\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t and Marathon. See ; ; \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to , Eurystheus marched against\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Heraclids and Iolaus at Marathon; he fell in the battle, and his body was buried at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGargettus, but his head was cut off and buried separately in Tricorythus, under the high\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\troad, at the spring Macaria, and the place was hence called the Head of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEurystheus. Thus Strabo lays the scene of the battle and of the death of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEurystheus at Marathon. From  we know that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspring Macaria, named after the heroine who sacrificed herself to gain the victory for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Heraclids, was at Marathon. The name seems to have been applied to the powerful\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubterranean springs which form a great marsh at the northern end of the plain of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarathon. The ancient high road, under which the head of Eurystheus was buried, and of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich traces existed down to modern times, here ran between the marsh on the one hand\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the steep slope of the mountain on the other. At the northern end of the narrow\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdefile thus formed by the marsh and the mountain stands the modern village of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKato-Souli, which is proved by inscriptions to have occupied the site of the ancient\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTricorythus. See , and  But , at or near which, according to Euripides, the body of Eurystheus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas buried, lay some eighteen miles or so away at the northern foot of Mount , in the gap which divides the high and steep\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmountains of Pentelicus and  from each other. That gap, forming the only gateway\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the plain of  from the north\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teast, was strategically very important, and hence was naturally the scene of various\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbattles, legendary or historical. Gargettus, where, according to Strabo, confirmed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHesychius and Stephanus Byzantius s.v. , the headless trunk of Eurystheus was interred, seems\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto have lain on the opposite side of the gap, near the foot of Pentelicus, where a small\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmodern village, Garito, apparently preserves the ancient name. See ;  who differs as to the site of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGargettus;  Thus the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstatements of Euripides and Strabo about the place where the body of Eurystheus was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tburied may be reconciled if we suppose that it was interred at Gargettus facing over\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst , which lay on the opposite\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor southern side of the gap between Pentelicus and . For the battles said to have been fought at various times in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\timportant pass, see ; , with Sir J. E. Sandys's note;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; . The statement of Apollodorus that Hyllus killed Eurystheus and brought his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thead to Alcmena, who gouged out his eyes with weaving-pins, is repeated by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, who probably here, as so often, simply copied our\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tauthor without acknowledgment. According to , the slayer of Eurystheus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas not Hyllus but Iolaus; and this seems to have been the common tradition. Can we\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texplain the curious tradition that the severed head and body of the foeman Eurystheus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere buried separately many miles apart, and both of them in passes strategically\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\timportant? According to ,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEurystheus, before being killed by the order of Alcmena, announced to the Athenians\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, in gratitude for their merciful, though fruitless, intercession with Alcmena, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould still, after his death, lying beneath the sod, be a friend and saviour to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, but a stern foe to the descendants\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Heraclidsthat is, to the Argives and Spartans, both of whom traced the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblood of their kings to Herakles. Further, he bade the Athenians not to pour libations\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor shed blood on his grave, for even without such offerings he would in death benefit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem and injure their enemies, whom he would drive home, defeated, from the borders of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. From this it would seem that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tghost of Eurystheus was supposed to guard  against invasion; hence we can understand why his body should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdivided in two and the severed parts buried in different passes by which enemies might\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarch into the country, because in this way the ghost might reasonably be expected to do\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdouble duty as a sentinel or spiritual outpost in two important places at the same time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSimilarly the dead Oedipus in his grave at  was believed to protect the country and ensure its welfare. See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; ; ; . So Orestes, in gratitude for his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tacquittal at , is represented by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAeschylus as promising that even when he is in his grave he will prevent any  leader from marching against . See  And Euripides makes Hector declare that the foreigners who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfought in defence of  were no\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall security to the city even when they had fallen and were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlying in their heaped-up graves. See . These examples show that in the opinion of the Greeks the ghosts even of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforeigners could serve as guardian spirits of a country to which they were attached by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tties of gratitude or affection; for in each of the cases I have cited the dead man who\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas thought to protect either  or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t was a stranger from a strange land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome of the Scythians in antiquity used to cut off the heads of their enemies and stick\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem on poles over the chimneys of their houses, where the skulls were supposed to act\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas watchmen or guardians, perhaps by repelling any foul fiends that might attempt to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenter the dwelling by coming down the chimney. See . So tribes in , who make a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpractice of cutting off the heads of their enemies and garnishing their houses with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese trophies, imagine that they can propitiate the spirits of their dead foes and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconvert them into friends and protectors by addressing the skulls in endearing language\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand offering them food. See  The references in Greek legend to men who habitually relieved\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrangers of their heads, which they added to their collection of skulls, may point to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe former existence among the Greeks of a practice of collecting human skulls for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpurpose of securing the ghostly protection of their late owners.

Hence they quitted  and retired to Marathon and dwelt there. Now before they came out of , Tlepolemus had killed Licymnius inadvertently; for while he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeating a servant with his stick Licymnius ran in between; so he fled with not a few, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcame to , and dwelt there. But Hyllus married Iole according to his father's commands, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsought to effect the return of the Heraclids. So he went to  and inquired how they should return; and the god\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid that they should await the third crop before returning. But Hyllus supposed that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthird crop signified three years; and having waited that time he returned with his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy of Hercules to ,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen Tisamenus, son of Orestes, was reigning over the Peloponnesians. And in another battle the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeloponnesians were victorious, and Aristomachus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas slain. But when the sons of Cleodaeus were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrown to man's estate, they inquired of the oracle concerning their return. And the god\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thaving given the same answer as before, Temenus blamed him, saying that when they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tobeyed the oracle they had been unfortunate. But the god retorted that they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves to blame for their misfortunes, for they did not understand the oracles, seeing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat by  the third crop he meant, not a crop of the earth, but a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcrop of a generation, and that by the narrows he meant the broad-bellied sea on the right\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Isthmus. On hearing that, Temenus made ready the army and built\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tships in  where the place is now named\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t from that. While the army was there, Aristodemus was killed by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthunderbolt, leaving twin sons,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEurysthenes and Procles, by Argia, daughter of Autesion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t And it chanced that a calamity also befell the army at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. For there appeared to them a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsoothsayer reciting oracles in a fine frenzy, whom they took for a magician sent by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeloponnesians to be the ruin of the army. So Hippotes, son of Phylas, son of Antiochus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tson of Hercules, threw a javelin at him, and hit and killed him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn consequence of that, the naval force perished with the destruction of the fleet, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe land force suffered from famine, and the army disbanded. When Temenus inquired of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toracle concerning this calamity, the god said that these things were done by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsoothsayer and he ordered him to banish the slayer for ten years and to take for his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tguide the Three-Eyed One. So they banished Hippotes, and sought for the Three-Eyed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOne. Andthey chanced to light on Oxylus, son of Andraemon, a man sitting on a one-eyed horse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t its other eye having been knocked out with an arrow; for he had fled\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto  on account of a murder, and was now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturning from there to  after the lapse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof a year. So guessing the purport\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the oracle, they made him their guide.

According to Euripides, Agenor had three sons,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCilix, Phoenix, and Thasus. See .

In\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying this, Pausanias followed Herodotus, who tells us that the Phoenician colonists of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t discovered wonderful gold mines there,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich the historian had visited , and that they had founded a sanctuary of Herakles in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tisland . Herodotus also\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t represents Cilix as a son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Phoenician Agenor, and he tells us  that Cadmus, son of Agenor, left a Phoenician colony in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tisland of . Diodorus Siculus reports\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t that Cadmus, son of Agenor, planted a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoenician colony in , and that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdescendants of the colonists continued to hold the hereditary priesthood of Poseidon,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhose worship had been instituted by Cadmus. He mentions also that in the sanctuary of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAthena at , in , there was a tripod of ancient style bearing a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoenician inscription. The statement has been confirmed in recent years by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscovery of the official record of the temple of Lindian Athena in . For in this record, engraved on a marble slab,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere occurs the following entry: Cadmus dedicated a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbronze tripod engraved with Phoenician letters, as Polyzalus relates in the fourth book\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the histories.

However, from such legends all\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat we can safely infer is that the Greeks traced a blood relationship between the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoenicians and Cilicians, and recognised a Phoenician element in some of the Greek\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tislands and parts of the mainland.

For example, some of the Australian aborigines used to cut off the thumbs of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tright hands of dead enemies to prevent their ghosts from throwing spears. See . In Travancore the spirits of murderers who have been hanged are thought to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe very mischievous; hence, in order to prevent them from doing harm, it used to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcustomary to cut off the heels of the criminal with a sword or to hamstring him as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tswung on the gallows. See  In , when a person falls sick soon after the death\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof a member of the family, it is supposed that the sickness is caused by the dead man,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho cannot rest in his grave until he has drawn away one of his kinsfolk to the spirit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tland.

See ; and for a description of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pool as it is at the present time, see  Never having been in hell before, Dionysus did not know how to go\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere, and he was reduced to the necessity of asking the way. A certain Prosymnus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpointed it out to the deity on condition of receiving a certain reward. When Dionysus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturned from the lower world, he found that his guide had died in the meantime; but he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpunctually paid the promised reward to the dead man at his grave with the help of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbranch of fig wood, which he whittled into an appropriate shape.

Pausanias calls the god's guide\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolymnus, unless that form of the name is the mistake of a copyist for Prosymnus, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tseems to be suggested by the epithet , which was applied to Demeter in the sacred grove at , where Dionysus also had an image. See . However, Hyginus gives Hypolipnus as the name of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe guide to hell. Every year the descent of the god through the deep water was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcelebrated with nocturnal rites on the reedy margin of the pool . The pious Pausanias shrank from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdivulging the nature of the rites; but from Plutarch we learn that a lamb was thrown\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the lake as an offering to the warder of hell, while on trumpets hidden in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgod's leafy emblems the buglers blew blasts which, startling the stillness and darkness\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof night, were believed to summon up the lost Dionysus from the watery depths. See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. Perhaps in answer to this bugle call an actor,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdressed in the vine-god's garb, may have emerged dripping from the pool to receive the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcongratulations of the worshippers on his rising from the dead. However, according to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tothers, the resurrection of Dionysus and his mother took place, not in the gloomy swamp\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat , but on the beautiful, almost\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlandlocked, bay of , where nowadays\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgroves of oranges and lemons, interspersed with the dark foliage of tall cypresses,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfringe the margin of the calm blue water at the foot of the rugged mountains. See . Plutarch has drawn a visionary picture of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tscene of the ascension. It was, he says, a mighty chasm like the caves sacred to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBacchus, mantled with woods and green grass and blooming flowers of every sort, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texhaling a delicious, an intoxicating, perfume, while all about it the souls of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeparted circled and stooped upon the wing like flights of birds, but did not dare to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcross its tremendous depth. It was called the Place of Forgetfulness. See  A pretty story was told of the device by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich Dionysus induced the grim warden of the dead to release the soul of his mother\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the infernal gaol. It is said that Hades consented to set her free provided that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ther son would send of his best beloved to replace her shade in the world of shadows. Now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof all the things in the world the dearest to Dionysus were the ivy, the vine, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyrtle; so of these he sent the myrtle, and that is why the initiated in his rites\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twreathed their brows with myrtle leaves.

Great diversity of opinion prevailed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tamong the ancients with regard to the number of Niobe's children. Diodorus, Ovid,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHyginus, Lactantius Placidus, and the First Vatican Mythographer agree with Apollodorus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas to the seven sons and seven daughters of Niobe, and from the , we learn that Aeschylus, Euripides, and Aristophanes in lost plays\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadopted the same numbers, but that Pherecydes agreed with Homer in reckoning six sons\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand six daughters, while Hellanicus allowed the lady no more than four sons and three\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdaughters. On the other hand, Xanthus the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLydian, according to the same Scholiast, credited her with a score of children, equally\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdivided between the two sexes. Herein he probably followed the authority of Hesiod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsee Apollodorus, below, and the same liberal computation is said to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been accepted by Bacchylides, Pindar, and Mimnermus, while Sappho reduced the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfigure to twice nine, and Alcman to ten all told ; . Aeschylus and Sophocles\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teach wrote a tragedy , of which some fragments remain. See ; . The subject is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trendered famous by the fine group of ancient statuary now in the Uffizi gallery at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. See \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAntiquity hesitated whether to assign the group to Scopas or Praxiteles\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, and modern opinion is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstill divided on the question. See . The pathetic character of the group may perhaps be held to speak\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin favour of Scopas, who seems to have excelled in the portrayal of the sterner, sadder\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temotions, while Praxiteles dwelt by preference on the brighter, softer creations of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGreek religious imagination. This view of the sombre cast of the genius of Scopas is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested by the subjects which he chose for the decoration of the temple of Athena Alea\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat  , and by the scanty remains of the sculptures which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been found on the spot. See  However, the late historian of Greek sculpture, Professor M. Collignon,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdenied that the original of this famous group, which he regarded as a copy, was either\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby Scopas or Praxiteles. He held that it belongs to an Asiatic school of sculpture\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcharacterized by picturesque grouping, and that it could not have been executed before\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe third century B.C. To the same school he would assign another famous group of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsculpture, that of Dirce and the bull above, Frazer on Apollod.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.5.5.

And he married a daughter of Menoeceus; some say that she was Jocasta, and some\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat she was Epicasta. The oracle had warned him notto beget a son, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe son that should be begotten would kill his father; nevertheless, flushed with wine, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad intercourse with his wife. And when the babe was born he pierced the child's ankles\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith brooches and gave it to a herdsman to expose. But the herdsman exposed it on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCithaeron; and the neatherds of Polybus, king of , found the infant and brought it to his wife Periboea. She\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadopted him and passed him off as her own, and after she had healed his ankles she called\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim Oedipus, giving him that name on account of his swollen feet. When the boy grew up and excelled his fellows\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin strength, they spitefully twitted him with being supposititious. He inquired of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeriboea, but could learn nothing; so he went to  and inquired about his true parents. The god told him not to go to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnative land, because he would murder his father and lie with his mother. On hearing that,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand believing himself to be the son of his nominal parents, he left , and riding in a chariot through  he fell in with Laius driving in a chariot in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcertain narrow road. And when Polyphontes,the herald of Laius, ordered him to make way and killed one of his horses\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he disobeyed and delayed, Oedipus in a rage killed both Polyphontes and Laius, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarrived in .  Laius was buried by Damasistratus, king of , and Creon, son of Menoeceus, succeeded to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe kingdom. In his reign a heavy calamity befell . For Hera sent the Sphinx, whose mother was Echidna and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ther father Typhon; and she had the face of a woman, the breast and feet and tail of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlion, and the wings of a bird. And having learned a riddle from the Muses, she sat on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMount Phicium, and propounded it to the Thebans. And the riddle was this: What\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis that which has one voice and yet becomes four-footedand two-footed and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthree-footed? Now the Thebans were in possession of an oracle which declared that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be rid of the Sphinx whenever they had read her riddle; so they often met and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed the answer, and when they could not find it the Sphinx used to snatch away one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof them and gobble him up. When many had perished, and last of all Creon's son Haemon,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCreon made proclamation that to him who should read the riddle he would give both the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkingdom and the wife of Laius. On hearing that, Oedipus found the solution, declaring that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe riddle of the Sphinx referred to man; for as a babe he is four-footed, going on four\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlimbs, as an adult he is two-footed, and as an old man he gets besides a third support in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta staff. So the Sphinx threw herself from the citadel, and Oedipus both succeeded to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkingdom and unwittingly married his mother, and begat sons by her, Polynices and Eteocles,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand daughters, Ismene and Antigone. But some say the children were borne to him by Eurygania,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdaughter of Hyperphas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t When the secret afterwards came to light, Jocasta hanged\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\therself in a noose, and Oedipuswas driven from , after he had put out his eyes and cursed his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsons, who saw him cast out of the city without lifting a hand to help him. And having come with Antigone to  in , where is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprecinct of the Eumenides, he sat down there as a suppliant, was kindly received by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTheseus, and died not long afterwards."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "bibl": [{"@n": "Eur.

One summer day, when the heat and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstillness of noon reigned in the mountains, the goddess and the nymph had stripped and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere enjoying a cool plunge in the fair-flowing spring of Hippocrene on Mount Helicon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the youthful Tiresias, roaming the hills with his dogs, came to slake his thirst at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bubbling spring and saw what it was not lawful to see.

The notion that it is unlucky to see snakes coupling appears to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twidespread. In Southern India the sight of two snakes coiled round each other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin sexual congress is considered to portend some great evil\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. The Chins of Northeastern India think that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone of the worst omens that it is possible to see is two snakes copulating,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand a man who sees this is not supposed to return to his house or to speak to anyone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil the next sun has risen .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is considered extremely unlucky for a Chin to come upon two snakes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcopulating, and to avoid ill-fortune he must remain outside the village that night,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twithout eating cooked food; the next morning he may proceed to his house, but, on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarrival there, must kill a fowl and, if within his means, hold a feast. If a man omits\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese precautions and is found out, he is liable to pay compensation of a big , a pig, one blanket, and one bead, whatever his means, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first man he brings ill-luck to by talking to him. Before the British occupation, if\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe man, for any reason, could not pay the compensation, the other might make a slave of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim, by claiming a pig whenever one of his daughters married\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. In the  certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treligious ceremonies are prescribed when a person has seen snakes coupling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; the nature of the ceremonies is not described. In\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTimorlaut, one of the East Indian Islands, it is deemed an omen of great misfortune if a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tman dreams that he sees snakes coupling . Similarly in Southern India there prevails a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuperstitious belief that, if a person sees two crows engaged in sexual congress, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twill die unless one of his relations sheds tears. To avert this catastrophe, false news\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas to the death are sent by the post or telegraph, and subsequently corrected by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tletter or telegram announcing that the individual is alive . A similar belief as to the dire effect of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tseeing crows coupling, and a similar mode of averting the calamity, are reported in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t of  ."}], "milestone": {"@n": "7", "@unit": "section"}, "pb": [{"@n": "363"}, {"@n": "365"}, {"@n": "367"}], "gap": null, "quote": {"@type": "verse", "l": ["The saying of Tiresias to Zeus and Hera.", "Of ten parts a man enjoys one only;", "But a woman enjoys the full ten parts in her heart."], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "bibl": ["Scholiast on Lycophron 683", "Scholiast on Hom.

Now there was among the Thebans\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta soothsayer, Tiresias, son of Everes and a nymph Chariclo, of the family of Udaeus, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpartan, and he had lost the sight\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof his eyes. Different stories are told about his blindness and his power of soothsaying.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor some say that he was blinded by the gods because he revealed their secrets to men.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut Pherecydes says that he was blinded by Athena; for Chariclo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas dear to Athena  and Tiresias saw the goddess stark naked, and she covered his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teyes with her hands, and so rendered him sightless.

The same writer tells us that a man struck by lightning was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeemed to be disgraced, nay, he was honoured as a god; even slaves killed by lightning\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere approached with respect, as honoured by Zeus, and their dead bodies were wrapt in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfine garments. Such customs are to some extent explained by the belief that Zeus himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdescended in the flash of lightning; hence whatever the lightning struck was naturally\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tregarded as holy. Places struck by lightning were sacred to Zeus the Descender\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  and were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosed by a fence.

They consider that it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoverned by the , or ghost, of the greatest and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmost renowned of their departed chiefs, and who is emphatically styled the ; but they are not at all clear as to which of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tancestors is intended by this designation. Hence they allow of no lamentation being made\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a person killed by lightning, as they say that it would be a sign of disloyalty to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlament for one whom the  had sent for, and whose\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tservices he consequently needed; and it would cause him to punish them, by making the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlightning again to descend and do them another injury. Further, rites of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpurification have to be performed by a priest at the kraal where the accident took\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplace; and till these have been performed, none of the inhabitants may leave the kraal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor have intercourse with other people. Meantime their heads are shaved and they must\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabstain from drinking milk. The rites include a sacrifice and the inoculation of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople with powdered charcoal. See . Sometimes, however, the ghosts of persons who\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been killed by lightning are deemed to be dangerous. Hence the Omahas used to slit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe soles of the feet of such corpses to prevent their ghosts from walking about. See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. For more evidence of special treatment accorded to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbodies of persons struck dead by lightning, see ; ; ; ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Among the Barundi of Central Africa, a man or woman\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho has been struck, but not killed, by lightning becomes thereby a priest or priestess\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the god Kiranga, whose name he or she henceforth bears and of whom he or she is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeemed a bodily representative. And any place that has been struck by lightning is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenclosed, and the trunk of a banana-tree or a young fig-tree is set up in it to serve as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe temporary abode of the deity who manifested himself in the lightning.

And wishing like his father to wean his subjects from unrighteousness\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the said that Zeus constantly visited him in the likeness of a stranger to view the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trighteous and the unrighteous. And once, as he himself said, being about to receive the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgod, he offered a sacrifice. But of his fifty sons, whom he had, as they say, by many\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twomen, there were some present at the sacrifice, and wishing to know if they were about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto give hospitality to a real god, they sacrificed a child and mixed his flesh with that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the victim, in the belief that their deed would be discovered if the visitor was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgod indeed. But they say that the deity caused great storms to burst and lightnings to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflash, and that all the murderers of the child perished. A similar version of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe story is reported by , who adds that Zeus in his wrath\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tupset the table, killed the sons of Lycaon with a thunderbolt, and turned Lycaon himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinto a wolf. According to this version of the legend, which Apollodorus apparently\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccepted, Lycaon was a righteous king, who ruled wisely like his father Pelasgus before\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim see , but his virtuous\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tefforts to benefit his subjects were frustrated by the wickedness and impiety of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsons, who by exciting the divine anger drew down destruction on themselves and on their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvirtuous parent, and even imperilled the existence of mankind in the great flood. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to another, and perhaps more generally received, tradition, it was King Lycaon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thimself who tempted his divine guest by killing and dishing up to him at table a human\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing; and, according to some, the victim was no other than the king's own son Nyctimus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSee ; ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. Some, however, said that the victim\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas not the king's son, but his grandson Arcas, the son of his daughter Callisto by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZeus. See ; ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. According to , the victim was a Molossian hostage. Others said simply that Lycaon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tset human flesh before the deity. See ; . For this crime Zeus changed the wicked king into a wolf,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to Hyginus, Ovid, the Scholiast on Caesar Germanicus, and the First Vatican\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMythographer; but, on the other hand, Clement of Alexandria, Nonnus, Eratosthenes, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArnobius say nothing of such a transformation. The upsetting of the table by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindignant deity is recorded by  as well as by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t and Apollodorus. A somewhat different account of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttragical occurrence is given by Pausanias, who says  that Lycaon brought a human babe to the altar of Lycaean\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZeus, after which he was immediately turned into a wolf. These traditions were told to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texplain the savage and cruel rites which appear to have been performed in honour of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLycaean Zeus on Mount Lycaeus down to the second century of our era or later. It seems\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat a human victim was sacrificed, and that his inward parts , mixed with that of animal victims, was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpartaken of at a sort of cannibal banquet by the worshippers, of whom he who chanced to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttaste of the human flesh was believed to be changed into a wolf and to continue in that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshape for eight years, but to recover his human form in the ninth year, if in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmeantime he had abstained from eating human flesh. See ; . According to another\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccount, reported by Varro on the authority of a Greek writer Euanthes, the werewolf was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchosen by lot, hung his clothes on an oak tree, swam across a pool, and was then\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttransformed into a wolf and herded with wolves for nine years, afterwards recovering his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thuman shape if in the interval he had not tasted the flesh of man. In this account there\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis no mention of cannibalism. See ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. A certain Arcadian boxer, named\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDamarchus, son of Dinnytas, who won a victory at , is said to have been thus transformed into a wolf at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsacrifice of Lycaean Zeus and to have been changed back into a man in the tenth year\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tafterwards. Of the historical reality of the boxer there can be no reasonable doubt, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\this statue existed in the sacred precinct at , where it was seen by Pausanias; but in the inscription on it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich Pausanias copied, there was no mention made of the man's transformation into a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twolf. See . However, the transformation was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trecorded by a Greek writer, Scopas, in his history of Olympic victors, who called the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tboxer Demaenatus, and said that his change of shape was caused by his partaking of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinward parts of a boy slain in the Arcadian sacrifice to Lycaean Zeus. Scopas also spoke\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the restoration of the boxer to the human form in the tenth year, and mentioned that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\this victory in boxing at  was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubsequent to his experiences as a wolf. See ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. The continuance of human sacrifice\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the rites of Lycaean Zeus on Mount Lycaeus is hinted at by  in the second century of our era, and asserted by  in the third century. From these fragmentary notices it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thardly possible to piece together a connected account of the rite; but the mention of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe transformation of the cannibal into a wolf for eight or nine years suggests that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tawful sacrifice was offered at intervals either of eight or of nine years. If the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterval was eight years, it would point to the use of that eight years' cycle which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplayed so important a part in the ancient calendar of the Greeks, and by which there is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treason to think that the tenure of the kingship was in some places regulated. Perhaps\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe man who was supposed to be turned into a wolf acted as the priest, or even as the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincarnation, of the Wolf God for eight or nine years till he was relieved of his office\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat the next celebration of the rites. The subject has been learnedly discussed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. He regards Lycaean Zeus as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgod of light rather than of wolves, and for this view there is much to be said. See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrazer on Paus. 8.38.7 vol. iv. pp. 385ff.. The view would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconfirmed if we were sure that the solemn sacrifice was octennial, for the octennial\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod was introduced in order to reconcile solar and lunar time, and hence the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treligious rites connected with it would naturally have reference to the great celestial\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tluminaries. As to the octennial period, see the note on . But with this view of the festival it is difficult to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treconcile the part played by wolves in the myth and ritual. We can hardly suppose with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome late Greek writers, that the ancient Greek word for a year, , was derived from ,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta wolf, and , to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twalk.

But there was much diversity of opinion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas to the origin of the name Pleiades. Some derived it from the name of their mother\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPleione; but the most probable view appears to be that the name comes from , to sail, because in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMediterranean area these stars were visible at night during the summer, from the middle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof May till the beginning of November, which coincided with the sailing season in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tantiquity. This derivation of the name was recognized by some of the ancients\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. With regard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the number of the Pleiades, it was generally agreed that there were seven of them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut that one was invisible, or nearly so, to the human eye. Of this invisibility two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texplanations were given.

The scene of the play is laid on Mount Cyllene. Apollo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappears and complains of the loss of the cattle, describes how he has come from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t and through  in search of them, and offers a reward to anyone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho will help him to find the missing beasts. The proclamation reaches the ears of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSilenus, who hurries to the scene of action and warmly proffers the services of himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand his Satyrs in the search, only stipulating that the reward shall take the solid\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshape of cash down. His offer being accepted, the Satyrs at once open on the scent like\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsleuth-hounds and soon discover confused tracks of cattle pointing in different\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections. But in the very heat of this discovery they are startled by a strange sound,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe like of which they had never heard before. It is, in fact, the muffled sound of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlyre played by the youthful Hermes in the cave. At this point the nymph Cyllene issues\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the cavern and upbraids the wild creatures with the hubbub they are raising in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstillness of the green wooded hills. The Satyrs tender a humble apology for their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintrusion, but request to know the meaning of the strange sounds that proceed from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbowels of the earth. In compliance with their request the nymph explains how Zeus had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsecretly begotten Hermes on Maia in the cave,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thow she herself was acting temporarily as nurse to the child, how the infant grew at an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tastonishing and even alarming rate, and how, being detained in the cave by his father's\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\torders, he devoted his leisure hours to constructing out of a dead beast a curious toy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich emitted musical notes. Being pressed for a fuller explanation she describes how\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHermes made the lyre out of a tortoise shell, how the instrument was his only\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbalm of grief, his comforter, and how the child was transported with delight\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat the ravishing sweetness of the tones which spoke to him from the dead beast. Unmoved\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby this touching description, the Satyrs at once charge the precocious infant with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thaving stolen the cattle. His nurse indignantly repels the charge, stoutly declaring\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the poor child had inherited no propensity to thieving either from its father or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom its mother, and recommending his accusers to go and look for the thief elsewhere,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsince at their age, with their long beards and bald heads, they ought to know better\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan to trump up such ridiculous accusations, for which they may yet have to smart. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnurse's passionate defence of her little charge makes no more impression on the Satyrs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan her previous encomium on his musical talent: indeed their suspicions are quickened\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby her reference to the hides which the infant prodigy had used in the construction of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe lyre, and they unhesitatingly identify the skins in question with those of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmissing cattle. Strong in this conviction, they refuse to budge till the culprit has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen made over to them. At this point the Greek text begins to fail; we can just catch a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfew disjointed fragments of a heated dialogue between the nurse and the satyrs; the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twords cows, thief,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trascal, and so forth, occur with painful iteration, then all is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsilence.

Pausanias, who expressly rejects the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclaim of Arsinoe, quotes in favour of Coronis a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDelphic oracle, which he regards as decisive: for who should know the true mother of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAesculapius better than his own father Apollo? The testimony of the deity for once was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquite unambiguous.

In modern times the stones of , if we may say so, have risen up to testify to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe truth of this oracle. For in the course of the modern excavations at the great\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEpidaurian sanctuary of Aesculapius there was discovered a limestone tablet inscribed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith a hymn in honour of Apollo and Aesculapius, in which the family tree of the junior\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgod is set out with the utmost precision, and it entirely confirms the Delphic oracle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe author of the hymn was a certain native of , by name Isyllus, a man of such scrupulous accuracy that before\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpublishing his hymn he took the precaution of submitting it to the fount of knowledge at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t with an inquiry whether the god\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould sanction its publication.

Pausanias says that Gorgophone, daughter of Perseus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst married Perieres and had by him two sons, Aphareus and Leucippus, and that after\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\this death she married Oebalus, son of Cynortas Cynortes, and had by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim a son Tyndareus.

See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabove, ; . Tzetzes  agrees with him as to the sons, but makes Perieres the son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCynortas instead the son of Aeolus. Thus there were two traditions as to the father of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTyndareus; according to one, his father was Perieres, according to the other, he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOebalus. But the two traditions were agreed as to the mother of Tyndareus, whom they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trepresented as Gorgophone, daughter of Perseus. According to another account, which may\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been intended to reconcile the discrepant traditions as to the father of Tyndareus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOebalus was the son of Perieres and the father of Tyndareus, Icarius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArene, and the bastard Hippocoon, whom he had by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNicostrate.

This account is mentioned, but apparently not accepted, by Apollodorus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the present passage, though he says nothing about the daughter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArene and the bastardy of Hippocoon. If we accept this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlast version of the genealogy, Tyndareus was descended both from Oebalus and Perieres,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing the son of Oebalus and the grandson of Perieres.

Seeing the multitude of them, Tyndareus feared that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpreference of one might set the others quarrelling; but Ulysses promised that, if he would\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thelp him to win the hand of Penelope, he would suggest a way by which there would be no\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquarrel.

This seems to have been the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tversion of the story which Pindar followed; for in his description of the fatal affray\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween the cousins  he speaks only of anger about cattle as the motive that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tled Idas to attack Castor.

Further, since the name of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeucippus, the legendary father of the goddesses, means simply White\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHorse, it is tempting to suppose that the Leucippides, like their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpriestesses, were spoken of and perhaps conceived as white horses.

The traditions concerning the Palladium which have come\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdown to us are all comparatively late, and they differ from each other on various\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints; but the most commonly received account seems to have been that the image was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall wooden one, that it had fallen from heaven, and that so long as it remained in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t the city could not be taken. The Greek\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttradition was that the Palladium was stolen and carried off to the Greek camp by Ulysses\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand Diomedes see  and , and that its capture by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGreeks ensured the fall of .

These two traditions are clearly inconsistent with each other, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Roman tradition further conflicts with the belief that the city which possessed the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsacred image could not be captured by an enemy. Hence in order to maintain the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgenuineness of the image in the temple of Vesta, patriotic Roman antiquaries were driven\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto various expedients. They said, for example, that an exact copy of the Palladium had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen publicly exposed at , while the true\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone was carefully concealed in a sanctuary, and that the unsuspicious Greeks had pounced\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the spurious image, while the knowing Aeneas smuggled away the genuine one packed up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith the rest of his sacred luggage . Or they affirmed that the thief Diomedes had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstrained to restore the stolen image to its proper owners ; or that, warned by Athena in a dream,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the afterwards made it over to Aeneas in \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. But the Romans\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere not the only people who claimed to possess the true Palladium; the Argives\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaintained that it was with them , and the Athenians asserted that it was to be seen in their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tancient court of justice which bore the very name of Palladium. See ; ; ; ; ;  The most exact description of the appearance of the Palladium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis the one given by Apollodorus in the present passage, which is quoted, with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tauthor's name, by .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to , the image fell from heaven at the time\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen Ilus was building the temple of Athena; the structure was nearly completed, but the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\troof was not yet on, so the Palladium dropped straight into its proper place in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsacred edifice. ,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmentions a strange opinion that the Palladium was made out of the bones of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPelops, just as the Olympian image of Zeus was made out of other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbones of an Indian beast, that is, out of ivory.

Hence the goddess in pity either shut him up in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchamber and closed the shining doors on him, leaving him to lisp and babble there\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teternally, or she turned him into a grasshopper, the most musical of insects, that she\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmight have the joy of hearing her lover's voice sounding for ever in her ears. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tformer and sadder fate is vouched for by the hymn writer, the latter by the Scholiast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTzetzes perhaps lets us into the secret of the transformation when he tells us\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t that the grasshoppers, like\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe snakes, when they are old, slough their old age , literally old age, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapplied by the Greeks to the cast skins of serpents. It is a widespread notion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tamong savages, which the ancestors of the Greeks apparently shared, that creatures which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcast their skins, thereby renew their youth and live for ever. See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The ancient\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLatins seem also to have cherished the same illusion, for they applied the same name\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t or  to old age and to the cast skins of serpents."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "bibl": {"@n": "Apollod. 2.6.4", "#text": "Apollod.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.6.4"}, "#text": "See above, ."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "bibl": ["Tzetzes, Scholiast on Lycophron 224", {"@n": "Ov.

According to Apollodorus and Plutarch the murderer was Telamon; but according to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhat seems to have been the more generally accepted view he was Peleus. So\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDiodorus, Pausanias, the Scholiast on Homer, one of the , Ovid, and in one passage Lactantius Placidus. If Pherecydes was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tright in denying any relationship between Telamon and Peleus, and in representing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTelamon as a Salaminian rather than an Aeginetan see above, it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecomes probable that in the original tradition Peleus, not Telamon, was described as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe murderer of Phocus. Another version of the story was that both brothers had a hand\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the murder, Telamon having banged him on the head with a quoit, while Peleus finished\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim off with the stroke of an axe in the middle of his back. This was the account given\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby the anonymous author of the old epic ; and the same division\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof labour between the brothers was recognized by the Scholiast on Pindar and Tzetzes,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthough according to them the quoit was handled by Peleus and the cold steel by Telamon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOther writers Antoninus Liberalis and Hyginus lay the murder at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdoor of both brothers without parcelling the guilt out exactly between them. There seems\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be a general agreement that the crime was committed, or the accident happened, in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcourse of a match at quoits; but Dorotheus quoted by  alleged that the murder was perpetrated by Telamon at a boar hunt,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand this view seems to have been accepted by Lactantius Placidus in one place\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, though\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin other places  he speaks as if the brothers were equally guilty. But perhaps\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis version of the story originated in a confusion of the murder of Phocus with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubsequent homicide of Eurytion, which is said to have taken place at a boar-hunt,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhether the hunting of the Calydonian boar or another.

See  However, the version of Hyginus differs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the rest in a number of particulars. For example, he represents Tereus as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttransformed into a hawk instead of into a hoopoe; but for this transformation he had the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tauthority of  Tereus is commonly said\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto have been a Thracian, and the scene of the tragedy is sometimes laid in . Ovid, who adopts this account, appears to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tassociated the murder of Itys with the frenzied rites of the Bacchanals, for he says\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the crime was perpetrated at the time when the Thracian women were celebrating the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbiennial festival  of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDionysus, and that the two women disguised themselves as Bacchanals. On the other hand,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t definitely affirms that Tereus dwelt in Daulia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta district of Phocis, and that the tragedy took place in that country; at the same time\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the tells us that the population of the district was then Thracian. In this he is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowed by , Zenobius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConon, Pausanias, and . Thucydides supports his view by a reference to Greek\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpoets, who called the nightingale the Daulian bird. The Megarians maintained that Tereus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treigned at Pagae in , and they showed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\this grave in the form of a barrow, at which they sacrificed to him every year, using\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgravel in the sacrifice instead of barley groats .

Bacchylides, the Scholiast\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton Pindar, and Hyginus call Sinis a son of Poseidon Neptune. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tancients are not agreed as to the exact mode in which the ruffian Sinis despatched his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvictims. According to Diodorus, Pausanias, and the Scholiast on Pindar he bent two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpine-trees to the ground, tied the extremities of his victim to both trees, and then let\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe trees go, which, springing up and separating, tore the wretch's body in two. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tatrocious form of murder was at a later time actually employed by the emperor Aurelian\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a military execution. See . A Ruthenian pirate,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnamed Botho, is said to have put men to death in similar fashion. See . According to Hyginus, Sinis, with the help of his victim,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdragged down a pine-tree to the earth; then, when the man was struggling to keep the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttree down, Sinis released it, and in the rebound the man was tossed up into the air and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkilled by falling heavily to the ground. Apollodorus seems to have contemplated a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsimilar mode of death, except that he does not mention the cooperation of Sinis in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbending the tree to the earth. According to the \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t it was not on his journey from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t to  that Theseus killed Sinis, but at a later time, after he had come\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the throne and united the whole of \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunder a single government; he then returned to the Isthmus of , killed Sinis, and celebrated the Isthmian\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgames. This tradition seems to imply that Theseus held the games as a funeral honour\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpaid to the dead man, or more probably as an expiation to appease the angry ghost of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvictim. This implication is confirmed by the Scholiast on Pindar, who says that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to some people Theseus held the Isthmian games in honour of Sinis, whom he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkilled. Plutarch tells us  that when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTheseus had killed Sinis, the daughter of the dead man, by name Perigune, fled and hid\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\therself in a bed of asparagus; that she bore a son Melanippus to Theseus, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMelanippus had a son Ioxus, whose descendants, the Ioxids, both men and women, revered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand honoured asparagus and would not burn it, because asparagus had once sheltered their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tancestress. This hereditary respect shown by all the members of a family or clan for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparticular species of plant is reminiscent of totemism, though it is not necessarily a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproof of it."}], "placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Athens", "#text": "Athens"}, {"@key": "perseus,Epidauros", "#text": "Epidaurus"}, {"@key": "perseus,Corinth", "#text": "Corinth"}], "milestone": {"@n": "2", "@unit": "section"}, "pb": {"@n": "125"}, "#text": "Aethra bore to Aegeus a son Theseus, and when he was grown up, he pushed away the rock\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand took up the sandals and the sword, and hastened on foot to .

See  Euripides wrote two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttragedies on the same subject, both under the title of : it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe second which has come down to us. In the first  the poet,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincensed at the misconduct of his wife, painted the character and behaviour of Phaedra\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin much darker colours than in the second, where he has softened the portrait,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trepresenting the unhappy woman as instigated by the revengeful Aphrodite, but resisting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe impulse of her fatal passion to the last, refusing to tell her love to Hippolytus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand dying by her own hand rather than endure the shame of its betrayal by a blabbing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnurse. This version of the story is evidently not the one here followed by Apollodorus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to whom Phaedra made criminal advances to her stepson. On the other hand the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tversion of Apollodorus agrees in this respect with that of the : both writers may have followed the first \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Euripides. As to that lost play, of which some fragments have come down to us, see\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ; the Greek ;  Apollodorus says nothing as to the scene of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttragedy. Euripides in his extant play lays it at , whither Theseus had gone with Phaedra to be purified for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslaughter of the sons of Pallas . Pausanias agrees with this account, and tells us that the graves\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the unhappy pair were to be seen beside each other at , near a myrtle-tree, of which the pierced leaves still bore the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprint of Phaedra's brooch. The natural beauty of the spot is in keeping with the charm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich the genius of Euripides has thrown over the romantic story of unhappy love and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath. Of Troezen itself only a few insignificant ruins remain, overgrown with weeds and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdispersed amid a wilderness of bushes. But hard by are luxuriant groves of lemon and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\torange with here and there tall cypresses towering like dark spires above them, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbehind this belt of verdure rise wooded hills, and across the blue waters of the nearly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlandlocked bay lies Calauria, the sacred island of Poseidon, its peaks veiled in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsombre green of the pines. A different place and time were assigned by \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeneca to the tragedy. According to him, the events took\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplace at , and Phaedra conceived her\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpassion for Hippolytus and made advances to him during the absence of her husband, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad gone down to the nether world with Pirithous and was there detained for four years\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. Diodorus Siculus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagrees with Euripides in laying the scene of the tragedy at , and he agrees with Apollodorus in saying that at the time when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhaedra fell in love with Hippolytus she was the mother of two sons, Acamas and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDemophon, by Theseus. In his usual rationalistic vein Diodorus omits all mention of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoseidon and the sea-bull, and ascribes the accident which befell Hippolytus to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmental agitation he felt at his stepmother's calumny."}], "pb": [{"@n": "145"}, {"@n": "147"}, {"@n": "149"}], "placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Athens", "#text": "Athens"}, "milestone": [{"@n": "17", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "18", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "19", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "20", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Theseus joined Hercules in his expedition against the Amazons and carried off Antiope,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor, as some say, Melanippe; but Simonides calls her Hippolyte.Wherefore the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAmazons marched against , and having\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttaken up a position about the Areopagus they were vanquished by the Athenians under Theseus.

The story was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttold by Pherecydes, as we learn from the Scholiasts on Sophocles and Apollonius Rhodius\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(ll.cc.). It was also the theme of two plays called , one of them\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby Sophocles, and the other by Euripides. See ;  The versions of the story given by Tzetzes and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t agree closely with each other and with that of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApollodorus, which they may have copied. They agree with him and with the Scholiast on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPindar in alleging an incestuous passion of Oenomaus for his daughter as the reason why\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the was reluctant to give her in marriage; indeed they affirm that this was the motive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tassigned for his conduct by the more accurate historians, though they also mention the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toracle which warned him that he would perish at the hands of his in-law. The fear of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis prediction being fulfilled is the motive generally alleged by the extant writers of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tantiquity. Diodorus Siculus mentions some particulars which are not noticed by other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tauthors. According to him, the goal of the race was the altar of Poseidon at , and the suitor was allowed a start; for before\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmounting his chariot Oenomaus sacrificed a ram to Zeus, and while he was sacrificing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuitor drove off and made the best of his way along the road, until Oenomaus, having\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcompleted the sacrifice, was free to pursue and overtake him. The sacrifice was offered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat a particular altar at , which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome people called the altar of Hephaestus, and others the altar of Warlike Zeus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. In the eastern gable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the temple of Zeus at  the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcompetitors with their chariots and charioteers were represented preparing for the race\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the presence of an image of Zeus; among them were Hippodamia and her mother Sterope.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese sculptures were found, more or less mutilated, by the Germans in their excavation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof  and are now exhibited in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlocal museum. See  with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Curiously\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenough, the scene of the story is transposed by the , who affirms that Oenomaus reigned in , though at the same time he says, in accordance with the usual\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttradition, that the goal of the race was the Isthmus of . The connexion of Oenomaus with  is to a certain extent countenanced by a story for which the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tauthority cited is Theopompus. He related that when Pelops was on his way to   to woo Hippodamia, his charioteer Cillus died in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, and that his ghost appeared to Pelops\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a dream, lamenting his sad fate and begging to be accorded funeral honours. So Pelops\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tburned the dead man's body, buried his ashes under a barrow, and founded a sanctuary of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCillaean Apollo close by. See the \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhere for  we should perhaps read , he burned the body to ashes with fire,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t being apparently used in the sense of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdead body. Strabo describes the tomb of Cillus or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCillas, as he calls him, as a great mound beside the sanctuary of Cillaean Apollo, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the places the grave and the sanctuary, not in , but on the opposite mainland, in the territory of , though he says that there was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCillaeum also in .

However, with the assistance of Zeus, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trightful claimant Atreus was able to exhibit a still greater portent, which was the sun\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the Pleiades retracing their course in the sky and setting in the east instead of in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe west. This mighty marvel, attesting the divine approbation of Atreus, clinched the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdispute in his favour; he became king, and banished his rival Thyestes. According to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent account, which found favour with the Latin poets, the sun reversed his course\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the sky, not in order to demonstrate the right of Atreus to the crown, but on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to mark his disgust and horror at the king for murdering his nephews and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdishing up their mangled limbs to their father Thyestes at table. See ; ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; ; ; ;  From the verses of Statyllius Flaccus we may infer that this latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas the interpretation put on the backward motion of the sun by Sophocles in his tragedy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. See . In later times rationalists explained the old fable by saying\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Atreus was an astronomer who first calculated an eclipse, and so threw his less\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tscientific brother into the shade ; , or who first pointed out\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the sun appears to revolve in a direction contrary to the motion of the stars. See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; . A\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfragment of Euripides appears to show that he put in the mouth of Atreus this claim to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tastronomical discovery. See . A still\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore grandiose explanation of the myth was given by Plato l.c., who adduced it, with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrave irony, as evidence that in alternate cycles of vast duration the universe revolves\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin opposite directions, the reversal of its motion at the end of each cycle being\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccompanied by a great destruction of animal life. This magnificent theory was perhaps\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggested to the philosopher by the speculations of Empedocles, and it bears a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresemblance not only to the ancient Indian doctrine of successive epochs of creation and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdestruction, but also to Herbert Spencer's view of the great cosmic process as moving\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teternally in alternate and measureless cycles of evolution and dissolution.

Each of the Winegrowers received from Dionysus the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpower of producing the thing from which she derived her name; thus Elais, who took her\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tname from , an olive, could\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduce olive oil; Spermo, who took her name from , seed, could produce corn; and Oeno, who took\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ther name from , wine, could\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduce wine.

Possessing these valuable powers, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdaughters of Anius were naturally much sought after.

This hospitable offer was apparently not accepted at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoment; but afterwards, when the Greeks were encamped before , Agamemnon sent for the young women and ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem peremptorily to feed his army. This they did successfully, if we may believe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTzetzes; but, to judge by Ovid's account, they found the work of the commissariat too\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texacting, for he says that they took to flight. Being overtaken by their pursuers, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprayed to Dionysus, who turned them into white doves. And that, says Servius, is why\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdown to this day it is deemed a sin to harm a dove in . From Tzetzes we learn that the story of these prolific damsels was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttold by Pherecydes and by the author of the epic , from whom\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPherecydes may have borrowed it.

See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. According to Proclus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Greeks were feasting in  when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhiloctetes was bitten by a water-snake. This is not necessarily inconsistent with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstatement of Apollodorus that the accident happened while the Greeks were sacrificing to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApollo, for the feast mentioned by Proclus may have been sacrificial. According to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanother version of the story, which Sophocles followed in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, the accident to Philoctetes happened, not in , but in the small island of , where a goddess of that name was worshipped,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the serpent which bit Philoctetes was the guardian of her shrine. See ; . Later writers identified  with Athena, and said that Philoctetes was stung while he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcleansing her altar or clearing it of the soil under which it was buried, as Tzetzes has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit. See ; ; .

See ; . The island of  is no doubt the desert island near\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t in which down to the first\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcentury B.C. were to be seen an altar of Philoctetes, a bronze serpent, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbow, and a breastplate bound with fillets, the memorial of his sufferings\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. The island had sunk in the sea\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore the time of Pausanias in the second century of our era . According to a different account, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunfortunate encounter of Philoctetes with the snake took place in  itself, the island where he was abandoned by his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomrades. See  and ; ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. Philoctetes was commonly supposed to have received the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbow and arrows of Hercules from that hero as a reward for his service in kindling the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpyre on Mount Oeta. See ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; ; ; . According to one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccount, which Servius has preserved, it was from these arrows, envenomed with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpoison of the hydra, and not from a serpent, that Philoctetes received his grievous\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thurt. It is said that Hercules on the pyre solemnly charged his friend never to reveal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe spot where his ashes should repose. Philoctetes promised with an oath to observe the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twish of his dying friend, but afterwards he betrayed the secret by stamping with his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfoot on the grave. Hence on his way to the war one of the poisoned arrows fell upon and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twounded the traitor foot. See ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. Homer speaks of Philoctetes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarooned by the Greeks in  and suffering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagonies from the bite of the deadly water-snake , but he does not say how or where the sufferer was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbitten.

The fate of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe forlorn hero, the ancient Robinson Crusoe, dwelling for ten years in utter solitude\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton his lonely isle, was a favourite theme of tragedy.

See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. Philostratus tells us that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbody was laid in the earth by direction of the seer Calchas, because suicides\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmay not lawfully receive the burial by fire . This was probably the true reason for the tradition that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe corpse was not cremated in the usual way. For the ghosts of suicides appear to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommonly dreaded; hence unusual modes of disposing of their bodies are adopted in order\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto render their spirits powerless for mischief. For example, the Baganda of Central\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfrica, who commonly bury their dead in the earth, burn the bodies of suicides on waste\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tland or at crossroads in order to destroy the ghosts; for they believe that if the ghost\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof a suicide is not thus destroyed, it will tempt other people to imitate its example.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs an additional precaution everyone who passed the place where the body of a suicide\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad been burnt threw some grass or a few sticks on the spot, so as to prevent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ghost from catching him, in case it had not been destroyed. For the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treason, if a man took his life by hanging himself on a tree, the tree was torn up by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\troots and burned with the body; if he had killed himself in a house, the house was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpulled down and the materials consumed with fire; for people feared to live\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a house in which a suicide had taken place, lest they too should be tempted to commit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same crime. See . Similar customs prevailed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tamong the Banyoro, a neighbouring nation of Central Africa. It was said to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessary to destroy a tree upon which a person had hanged himself and to burn down a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thouse in which a person had committed suicide, otherwise they would be a danger to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople in general and would influence them to commit suicide. See  where, however, the burning of the body is not expressly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmentioned. In like manner the Hos of , in West Africa, are much afraid of the ghost of a suicide. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieve that the ghost of a man who has hanged himself will torment the first person who\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsees the body. Hence when the relations of such a man approach the corpse they protect\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves against the ghost by wearing magical cords and smearing their faces with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmagical powder. The tree on which a man hanged himself is cut down, and the branch on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich he tied the fatal noose is lopped off. To this branch the corpse is then tied and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdragged ruthlessly through the woods, over stones and through thorny bushes, to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplace where men of blood, that is, all who die a violent death,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare buried. There they dig a shallow grave in great haste and throw the body in. Having\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdone so they run home; for they say that the ghosts of men of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblood fling stones at such as do not retreat fast enough, and that he who is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstruck by one of these stones must die. The houses of such men are broken down and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tburnt. A suicide is believed to defile the land and to prevent rain from falling. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe district where a man has killed himself must be purified by a sacrifice offered to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Earth-god. See . As to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspecial treatment of the bodies of suicides, see . In the  of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSophocles the rites of burial are at first refused, but afterwards conceded, to the dead\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbody of Ajax; and though these ceremonies are not described, we may assume that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincluded the burning of the corpse on a pyre. This variation from what appears to be the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tusual tradition may have been introduced by Sophocles out of deference to the religious\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfeelings of the Athenians, who worshipped Ajax as a hero, and who would have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshocked to think of his remains being denied the ordinary funeral honours.

And after these things he with Diomedes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconveys the Palladium out of .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom this it appears that Ulysses made two different expeditions to : in one of them he went by himself as a spy in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmean attire, and being recognized by Helen concerted with her measures for betraying\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t to the Greeks; in the other he went\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith Diomedes, and together the two stole the Palladium. The former of these expeditions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis described by Homer in the  , where Helen tells how Ulysses disfigured himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith wounds, and disguising himself in mean attire came as a beggar to ; how she alone detected him, wormed the secrets of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Greeks out of him, and having sworn not to betray him till he had returned in safety\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the ships, let him go free, whereupon on his way back he killed many Trojans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEuripides also relates this visit of Ulysses to , adding that Helen revealed his presence to Hecuba, who spared his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlife and sent him out of the country . These two quite distinct expeditions of Ulysses have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconfused and blended into one by Apollodorus. As to the joint expedition of Ulysses and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDiomedes to , and the stealing of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPalladium, see further ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; ; ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; ; ; ; ; ;  The narrative of Apollodorus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuggests that Ulysses had the principal share\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the exploit. But according to another and seemingly more prevalent tradition it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDiomedes who really bore off the image. This emerges particularly from Conon's account.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDiomedes, he tells us, mounted on the shoulders of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUlysses, and having thus scaled the wall, he refused to draw his comrade up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tafter him, and went in search of the Palladium. Having secured it, he returned with it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto Ulysses, and together they retraced their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsteps to the Greek camp. But by the way the crafty Ulysses conceived the idea of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmurdering his companion and making himself master of the fateful image. So he dropped\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbehind Diomedes and drew his sword. But the moon shone full; and as he raised his arm to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstrike, the flash of the blade in the moonlight caught the eye of the wary Diomedes. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfaced round, drew his sword, and, upbraiding the other with his cowardice, drove him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore him, while he beat the back of the recreant with the flat of his sword. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincident gave rise to the proverb, Diomedes's compulsion, applied\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto such as did what they were forced to do by dire necessity. The proverb is similarly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texplained by the other Greek proverb-writers and lexicographers cited above, except\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, instead of the flash of the sword in the moonlight, they say it was the shadow of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sword raised to strike him which attracted the attention of Diomedes. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpicturesque story appears to have been told in the \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. According to one account, Diomedes and Ulysses made\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir way into the Trojan citadel through a sewer , indeed a narrow and muddy sewer, as Sophocles\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled it in the play which he composed on the subject. See ; . Some affirmed that the Palladium was treacherously surrendered to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Greek heroes by Theano, the priestess of the goddess ; ; to this step she was said to have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinstigated by her husband Antenor ; . As to Theano in her\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity of priestess, see  The theft\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Palladium furnished a not infrequent subject to Greek artists; but the artistic,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlike the literary, tradition was not agreed on the question whether the actual thief was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDiomedes or Ulysses.

The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpoem of Arctinus, if we may judge by Proclus's abstract, opened with the deliberations\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Trojans about the Wooden Horse, and from the similarity of the abstract to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttext of Apollodorus we may infer that our author followed Arctinus generally, though not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin all details; for instance, he differed from Arctinus in regard to the affair of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaocoon and his sons. See below. With the stratagem of the Wooden Horse we may compare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe stratagem by which, in the war of Independence waged by the  against , Prince Maurice contrived to make himself master of . The city was then held by a Spanish garrison,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich received its supply of fuel by boats. The master of one of these boats, Adrian\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVandenberg by name, noticed that in the absence of the governor there was great\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnegligence in conducting the examination to which all boats were subjected before they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere allowed to enter the town. This suggested to Vandenberg a plan for taking the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcitadel by surprise. He communicated his plan to Prince Maurice, who readily embraced\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit. Accordingly the boat was loaded in appearance with turf as usual; but the turf was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupported by a floor of planks fixed at the distance of several feet from the bottom;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand beneath this floor seventy picked soldiers were placed under the command of an able\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tofficer named Harauguer. The boat had but a few miles to sail, yet through unexpected\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccidents several days passed before they could reach . The wind veered against them, the melting ice for it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe month of February retarded their course, and the boat, having struck upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta bank, was so much damaged that the soldiers were for some time up to their knees in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twater. Their provisions were almost spent, and to add to their anxieties one of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber was seized with a violent cough, which, if it had continued, would inevitably\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave betrayed them to the enemy. The man generously entreated his comrades to kill him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toffering them his own sword for the purpose; but they as generously refused, and happily\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe soldier's cough left him before they approached the walls. Even the leak in the boat\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas stopped by some accident. On reaching the fortifications the boat was searched, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly in the most superficial manner. Still the danger was great, for the turf was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately purchased and the soldiers of the garrison set to work to unload it. They\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould soon have uncovered the planks and detected the ambush, if the ready-witted master\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the boat had not first amused them with his discourse and then invited them to drink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twine with him. The offer was readily accepted. The day wore on, darkness fell, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpanish soldiers were all drunk or asleep. At dead of night Harauguer and his men issued\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the boat, and dividing into two bodies they attacked the guards and soon made\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves masters of two gates. Seized with a panic, the garrison fled the town. Prince\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaurice marched in and took possession of the citadel. These events happened in the year\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.

According to Arctinus, our oldest authority for the tragedy of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaocoon, the two serpents killed Laocoon himself and one of his sons. According to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirgil, Hyginus, and Servius, they killed Laocoon and both his sons. According to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQuintus Smyrnaeus, the serpents killed the two sons but spared the father, who lived to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlament their fate. This last seems to have been the version followed by Apollodorus. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treason of the calamity which befell Laocoon is explained by Servius on the authority of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEuphorion. He tells us that when the Greek army landed in the , the Trojans stoned the priest of Poseidon to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath, because he had not, by offering sacrifices to the sea god, prevented the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvasion. Accordingly, when the Greeks seemed to be departing, it was deemed advisable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto sacrifice to Poseidon, no doubt in order to induce him to give the Greeks a stormy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpassage. But the priesthood was vacant, and it was necessary to choose a priest by lot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe lot fell on Laocoon, priest of the Thymbraean Apollo, but he had incurred the wrath\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Apollo by sleeping with his wife in front of the divine image, and for this sacrilege\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the perished with his two sons. This narrative helps us to understand the statement of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApollodorus that the two serpents were sent by Apollo for a sign. According to Tzetzes,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe death of Laocoon's son took place in the temple of the Thymbraean Apollo, the scene\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the crime thus becoming the scene of the punishment. Sophocles wrote a tragedy on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubject of Laocoon, but though a few fragments of the play have survived, its contents\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare unknown. See ;  In\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmodern times the story of Laocoon is probably even better known from the wonderful group\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof statuary in the  than from the verses\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Virgil. That group, the work of three Rhodian sculptors, graced the palace of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\temperor Titus in the time of Pliny, who declared that it was to be preferred to any\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother work either of sculpture or painting .

The Scholiast on this passage of Euripides () says that Peleus was expelled by Acastus's two sons,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArchander and Architeles, and that the exiled king, going to meet his grandson\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeoptolemus, was driven by a storm to the island of Cos, where he was entertained by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcertain Molon and died. As to an early connexion between  and Cos, see  A different and much more detailed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of the exile of Peleus is furnished by .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to it, when Neoptolemus was refitting his shattered ships in Molossia, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theard that Peleus had been deposed and expelled by Acastus. Hastening to the aid of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taged grandfather, he found him hiding in a dark cave on the shore of one of the Sepiades\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIslands, where he eagerly scanned every passing sail in hopes that one of them would\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbring his grandson to his rescue. By disguising himself Neoptolemus contrived to attack\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand kill Acastus's two sons, Menalippus and Plisthenes, when they were out hunting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfterwards, disguising himself as a Trojan captive, he lured Acastus himself to the cave\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand would have slain him there, if it had not been for the intercession of Thetis, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad opportunely arrived from the sea to visit her old husband Peleus. Happy at his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tescape, Acastus resigned the kingdom on the spot to Neoptolemus, and that hero at once\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttook possession of the realm in company with his grandfather, his divine grandmother\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThetis, and the companions of his voyage. This romantic narrative may be based on a lost\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGreek tragedy, perhaps on the  of Sophocles, a play in which the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdramatist appears to have dealt with the fortunes of Peleus in his old age. See\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The statement of Dictys Cretensis that Peleus took refuge in one of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSepiades Islands suggests that in the  the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tname Icos should be read instead of Cos, as has been argued by several scholars\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; for Icos was a small\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tisland near  , and would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta much more natural place of refuge for Peleus than the far more distant island of Cos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, we have the positive affirmation of the poet Antipater of  that Peleus was buried in Icos\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. The connexion of Peleus with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Sepiades Islands is further supported by Euripides; for in his play\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  he tells how Thetis bids her old husband Peleus tarry in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcave of these islands, till she should come with a band of Nereids to fetch him away,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he might dwell with her as a god for ever in the depths of the sea. In the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplay  Euripides says\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Neoptolemus refused to accept the sceptre of Pharsalia in the lifetime of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrandfather Peleus."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "title": ["Andromache", "Hermione", "Andromache"], "bibl": [{"@n": "Eur.

But in the Trojan war he afterwards promised the hand of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHermione to Neoptolemus, if Neoptolemus should\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsucceed in capturing . Accordingly on his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn from the war Neoptolemus claimed his bride from her husband Orestes, who was then\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thaunted and maddened by the Furies of his murdered mother Clytaemnestra. Orestes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprotested, but in vain; Neoptolemus insolently reproached him with his crime of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmatricide and with the unseen avengers of blood by whom he was pursued. So Orestes was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tobliged to yield up his wife to his rival, but he afterwards took his revenge by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmurdering Neoptolemus at . This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tversion of the legend is followed also by . An obvious\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty is presented by the narrative; for if Menelaus had given his daughter in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarriage to Orestes, how could he afterwards have promised her to Neoptolemus in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlifetime of her first husband? This difficulty was met by another version of the story,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich alleged that Hermione was betrothed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor married to Orestes by her grandfather Tyndareus in the absence of her father\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMenelaus, who was then away at the Trojan war; that meantime, in ignorance of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisposal of his daughter, Menelaus had promised her hand to Neoptolemus before\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, and that on his return from the war\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeoptolemus took her by force from Orestes. See ; ; ; . According to the tragic poet Philocles, not only had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHermione been given in marriage by Tyndareus to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOrestes, but she was actually with child by Orestes when her father afterwards married\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ther to Neoptolemus. See . This former marriage of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHermione to Orestes, before she became\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe wife of Neoptolemus, is recognized by , and , but it is unknown to Homer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOn the other hand, Homer records that Menelaus betrothed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHermione to Neoptolemus at , and celebrated the marriage after his return to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t . Sophocles wrote a tragedy , the plot of which seems to have resembled that of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t of Euripides. See  Euripides does not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappear to have been consistent in his view that Neoptolemus forcibly deprived Orestes of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHermione and married her himself; for in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\this play Orestes  he makes Apollo prophesy to Orestes that he shall wed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHermione, but that Neoptolemus shall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnever do so."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Delphi", "#text": "Delphi"}, {"@key": "perseus,Delphi", "#text": "Delphi"}, {"@key": "perseus,Troy", "#text": "Troy"}, {"@key": "perseus,Delphi", "#text": "Delphi"}, {"@key": "perseus,Delphi", "#text": "Delphi"}, {"@key": "perseus,Delphi", "#text": "Delphi"}, {"@key": "perseus,Delphi", "#text": "Delphi"}, {"@key": "perseus,Delphi", "#text": "Delphi"}, {"@key": "tgn,7001399", "#text": "Thessaly"}, {"@key": "perseus,Delphi", "#text": "Delphi"}], "bibl": [{"@n": "Apollod.

This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texplanation seems to be due to Pherecydes, for a \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquotes the following passage from that early historian: When Neoptolemus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarried Hermione, daughter of Menelaus, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twent to  to inquire about offspring;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor he had no children by Hermione. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen at the oracle he saw the Delphians scrambling for  the flesh, he attempted to take it from them. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir priest Machaereus killed him and buried him under the threshold of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttemple. This seems to have been the version of the story followed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPausanias, for he mentions the hearth at  on which the priest of Apollo slew Neoptolemus , and elsewhere he says that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Pythian priestess ordered the Delphians to kill Pyrrhus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeoptolemus, son of Achilles ; compare . That the slayer of Neoptolemus was called Machaereus is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmentioned also by a  and by , who says that Neoptolemus was killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he demanded satisfaction from the god for the murder of his father,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor, more probably, because he had made an attack on the sanctuary. Indeed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsclepiades, in his work , wrote as follows: About\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\this death almost all the poets agree that he was killed by Machaereus and buried at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst under the threshold of the temple, but that afterwards Menelaus came and took up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\this body, and made his grave in the precinct. He says that Machaereus was a son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaetas. See . The story that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeoptolemus came to  to plunder the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsanctuary, which is noticed by Apollodorus and preferred by Strabo, is mentioned by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t and a . It is probably not inconsistent with the story that he went to demand\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsatisfaction from, or to inflict punishment on, the god for the death of his father; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe satisfaction or punishment would naturally take the shape of a distress levied on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe goods and chattels of the defaulting deity. The tradition that the slain Neoptolemus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas buried under the threshold of Apollo's temple is remarkable and, so far as I\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremember, unique in Greek legend. The statement that the body was afterwards taken up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand buried within the precinct agrees with the observation of  that quitting the temple and turning to the left you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcome to an enclosure, inside of which is the grave of Neoptolemus, son of Achilles. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDelphians offer sacrifice to him annually as to a hero. From  we learn that Neoptolemus even enjoyed a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpreeminence over other heroes at ,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing called on to preside over the processions and sacrifices in their honour. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAenianes of  used to send a grand\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprocession and costly sacrifices to \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tevery fourth year in honour of Neoptolemus. The ceremony fell at the same time as the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPythian games. See . It is a little difficult\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto understand how a man commonly accused of flagrant impiety and sacrilege should have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen raised to such a pitch of glory at the very shrine which he was said to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tattacked and robbed. The apparent contradiction might be more intelligible if we could\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuppose that, as has been suggested, Neoptolemus was publicly sacrificed as a scapegoat,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperhaps by being stoned to death, as seems to have been the fate of the human victims at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Thargelia, whose sacrifice was justified by a legend that the first of their number\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad stolen some sacred cups of Apollo. See ; and as to the suggestion that Neoptolemus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmay have been sacrificed as a scapegoat, see ,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho points out that according to \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeoptolemus was stoned as well as stabbed at the altar of Apollo.

But, acting on the principle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, the viceroy refused to cede the crown\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor the mitre to its proper owner; accordingly they had recourse to the ordeal of battle,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin which both combatants perished.

According to Plutarch and ,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe oracles were communicated in dreams; but Lucian says  that the inquirer wrote down his question on a tablet, which he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thanded to the prophet. The charge for one of these infallible communications was only\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo obols, or about twopence halfpenny. See ;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. The ancients seem to have been divided in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\topinion on the important question whether the oracular Amphilochus at  was the son or the grandson of Amphiaraus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApollodorus calls him the son of Alcmaeon, which would make him the grandson of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAmphiaraus, for Alcmaeon was a son of Amphiaraus. But Tzetzes, in reporting what he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdescribes as the usual version of the story, calls Amphilochus the son, not the grandson\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Amphiaraus . Compare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; . Lucian is inconsistent on the point; for while in one passage he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcalls Amphilochus the son of Amphiaraus , in another passage he speaks of him sarcastically as the noble son\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof an accurst matricide, by whom he means Alcmaeon .

There Ulysses was to sacrifice a ram, a bull, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta boar to Poseidon, the god whom he had offended. See . But the journey itself and the sacrifice are not recorded by Homer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a little island off Cos a Greek skipper told Dr. W. H. D. Rouse a similar story about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe journey inland of the prophet Elias. The prophet, according to this account, was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfisherman who, long buffeted by storms, conceived a horror of the sea, and, putting an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toar on his shoulder, took to the hills and walked till he met a man who did not know\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhat an oar was. There the prophet planted his oar in the ground, and there he resolved\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto abide. That is why all the prophet's chapels are on the tops of hills. This legend\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas published by Dr. Rouse in  under the heading of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA Greek skipper. This and the remaining part of Apollodorus are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprobably drawn from the epic poem , a work by Eugammon of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, of which a short abstract by Proclus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas been preserved. See  The author of the abstract informs us that after the death and burial of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe suitors Ulysses sacrificed to the nymphs and sailed to  to inspect the herds. And he was entertained by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolyxenus and received a present of a bowl. And after that followed the episodes of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrophonius, and Agamedes, and Augeas. Then he sailed home to  and offered the sacrifices prescribed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTiresias. And after these things he went to the Thesprotians and married Callidice,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tqueen of the Thesprotians. Then the Thesprotians made war on the Brygians, under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tleadership of Ulysses. There Ares put Ulysses and his people to flight, and Athena\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tengaged him in battle; but Apollo reconciled them. And after Callidice's death,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolypoetes, son of Ulysses, succeeded to the kingdom, and Ulysses himself went to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t. Meanwhile Telegonus, sailing in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsearch of his father, landed in  and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\travaged the island; and marching out to repel him Ulysses was killed by his son in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tignorance. Recognizing his error, Telegonus transported his father's body, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTelemachus, and Penelope to his mother, and she made them immortal. And Telegonus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarried Penelope, and Telemachus married Circe.
