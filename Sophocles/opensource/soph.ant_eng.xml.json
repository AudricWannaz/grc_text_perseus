I realized that they were ripping each other with their talons, murderouslythe rush of their wings did not lack meaning.Quickly, in fear, I tried burnt-sacrifice on a duly-kindled altar, but from my offerings Hephaestus did not blaze.  Instead juice that had sweated from the thigh-flesh trickled out onto the embers and smoked and sputtered;the gall was scattered high up in the air;  and the streaming thighs lay bared of the fat that had been wrapped around them.
