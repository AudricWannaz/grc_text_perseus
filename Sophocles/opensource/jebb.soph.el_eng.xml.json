The Homeric\n                                man who has killed another may either pay a fine to the kinsfolk, or\n                                go into exile; but in Homer there is no idea that he\n                                can be purified by a ritual. In other words, there is the notion of\n                                a debt in this respect, but hardly of a sin; of quittance, but not\n                                of absolution. It was a somewhat later stage when men began more\n                                distinctly to recognise that in cases of homicide there are kinds\n                                and degrees of moral guilt which cannot be expressed in the terms of\n                                human debtor and creditor. Clearly a man ought to do what the gods\n                                command. But what if a god tells a man to do something which most\n                                men think wrong? If the man obeys, and if his conduct is to be\n                                judged aright, the tribunal, like the instigation, must be divine.\n                                Nor is this so only when the opinion offended is that of men. A god\n                                may command a mortal to do an act by which some other god, or\n                                supernatural being, will be incensed. Suppose, for instance, that a\n                                man receives a divine mandate to slay a guilty kinsman; if he obeys,\n                                nothing can save him from angering the Erinyes, who resent every\n                                injury to kinsfolk."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "@resp": "RCJ", "#text": "Purification from\n                                    bloodguilt."}, "#text": "For questions such as these the Pythian creed provided  an answer, or at least a mystic compromise.\n                                Apollo, the god of light, is the all-seeing arbiter of purity. A man\n                                who commits homicide displeases Apollo, who abhors every stain of\n                                blood. But Apollo can estimate the degree of guilt.

In later\n                                days the critics of Apollo could object that he had encouraged crime\n                                by thus far alleviating its consequences.

More than a century\n                                elapsed after that date before Lyric poetry was matured; and\n                                meanwhile the worship of the Pythian Apollo, with its ritual of\n                                purification from blood, was diffused throughout the Greek world. It\n                                was to be expected, therefore, that, when the story of Orestes began\n                                to receive lyric treatment, the influence of Delphi should be\n                                apparent. If, in avenging his father, Orestes killed Clytaemnestra\n                                as well as Aegisthus, the Pythian priesthood had a text than which\n                                they could desire none more impressive. For, according to the\n                                immemorial and general belief of Hellenes, Orestes did well to\n                                avenge Agamemnon. If, however, he slew his mother, the Erinyes were\n                                necessarily called into activity. Who, then, was to vindicate the\n                                avenger? Who was to assert, even against the Erinyes, that his deed\n                                was righteous? Who but Apollo, the supreme judge of purity? And then\n                                it was only another step to represent Apollo himself as having\n                                prescribed the vengeance. A Greek vase-painting portrays him in the act of doing\n                                so. The scene is in the temple at Delphi. Apollo, laurel-crowned, is\n                                sitting on the omphalos; in his left hand is a lyre; with the stem\n                                of a laurel-branch, held in his right, he is touching the sheathed\n                                sword of Orestes, who stands in a reverent attitude before him; he\n                                thus consecrates it to the work of retribution. Behind Apollo, the\n                                Pythia sits upon the tripod, holding a diadem for the brows of\n                                Orestes, when he shall have done the deed; and near her is Pylades."}]}, {"@id": "cis4", "@type": "section", "@n": "4", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "@resp": "RCJ", "title": "Oresteia", "#text": "The\n                                     of Stesichorus."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "foot", "@n": "1", "@resp": "RCJ", "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "ap."}, "title": "Geschichte der griechischen\n                                    Lyrik", "#text": "Apollodorus\n                                        ( Hesychius) places his\n                                    birth in Ol. 37 (630 B.C.) and his death in Ol. 56 (556 B.C.).\n                                    Cp.

Orestes, wearing a cuirass, has plunged his\n                                sword into the breast of Aegisthus, who is falling from his\n                                seat,the throne that once was Agamemnon's. Meanwhile,\n                                something has startled Orestes; his face is turned away from\n                                Aegisthus; he glances over his right shoulder at a woman who hurries\n                                up behind him. This is Clytaemnestra, as an inscription certifies.\n                                She grasps the handle of an axe with both hands; she is coming to\n                                the rescue of Aegisthus. But an old man, wearing the conical hat of\n                                a herald, has overtaken her; his left hand grasps her right arm, his\n                                right, the axe; her purpose is baffled. Between her and Orestes\n                                stands a maiden whose uplifted hands express horror; this (as the\n                                artist informs us) is Chrysothemis. Vase A (as we shall call this\n                                one) must next be compared with vase B,another\n                                red-figured Attic vase of the fifth century,\n                                but of later date than the other.

Clytaemnestra, furiously\n                                brandishing her axe, is close behind Orestes,so close,\n                                that nothing can now save him from her blow. Electra (the name is\n                                inscribed) stands behind the dying Aegisthus; her outstretched right\n                                hand points at Clytaemnestra, her left is raised to the back of her\n                                head with a gesture of bewilderment and terror; evidently she is\n                                uttering a cry of warning to Orestes.

The question\n                                is answered when it is observed that, according to a widelyspread\n                                legend, the person who saved Orestes from the murderers, by carrying\n                                him away from Mycenae, was Talthybius, the faithful herald of\n                                    Agamemnon. Talthybius is\n                                here returning to Mycenae with the rightful heir, and preparing the\n                                way for the recognition by speaking to the old Nurse, who will\n                                remember him. He is the original of the Paedagogus in the\n                                     of Sophocles, and of the Old Man () in the  of\n                                Euripides; he also accounts for the prominence given to the herald\n                                in the  of Aeschylus."}]}, {"@id": "cis6", "@type": "section", "@n": "6", "p": [{"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "@resp": "RCJ", "#text": "Literary evidence."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "foot", "@n": "3", "@resp": "RCJ", "title": "Bild und Lied", "#text": "Robert, , p. 160."}], "title": ["Oresteia", "Choephori."], "#text": "The scene described above, in which Talthybius once \n                                more saves Orestes by foiling the armed Clytaemnestra, must have\n                                been taken from some familiar literary source.

Whom did Stesichorus\n                                choose as her emissary? It is a notable fact that Electra, who is\n                                unknown to Homer,  appears in the fifth century B.C. as\n                                a central personage of the story. And it seems that Aeschylus was\n                                not the first poet who had spoken of her. The earliest writer\n                                recorded as mentioning her is a lyric poet named Xanthus, who said\n                                that her original name was Laodic, and that she was\n                                called Electra because she was so long unmarried (); an etymology which points to a\n                                Dorian source (). Stesichorus, we\n                                are told, mentioned Xanthus as a lyric predecessor, and adapted much\n                                from him. The  is especially named as a work\n                                in which Stesichorus was thus indebted to Xanthus. How far, and in what sense, that statement is true,\n                                cannot now be known; but it is at least certain that Xanthus\n                                remained wholly obscure, while Stesichorus was widely popular. The\n                                introduction of Electra may be one of the points in which the\n                                Stesichorean  was indebted to Xanthus: and\n                                the fact of her figuring in that poem would fully explain her later\n                                prominence. Let us suppose, then, that Stesichorus, like Aeschylus,\n                                sent Electra with Clytaemnestra's offerings to Agamemnon's tomb.\n                                Orestes, on his return, would hasten to make his offerings\n                                thereas is assumed by all the three Attic dramatists. At\n                                the tomb the brother and sister would meet and recognise each other,\n                                as they do in Aeschylus. We know that Stesichorus brought in the\n                                nurse, whom he called Laodameia. Pindar makes a\n                                nurse save Orestes from the hands of Clytaemnestra, but he does not\n                                say that she carried him out of Argolis. The Laodameia of Stesichorus may have done\n                                likewisegiving Orestes to the trusty Talthybius, who\n                                carried him forth, and in due time came back with him. After the recognition of Orestes by Electra at the\n                                tomb, Stesichorus may have related the vengeance in the manner\n                                depicted on the Attic vases above mentioned. We know that Euripides\n                                was following Stesichorus in representing Orestes as defending\n                                himself against the Erinyes with the bow and arrows given by\n                                    Apollo. And the fact that the\n                                Stesichorean Orestes was pursued by the Erinyes shows that he slew\n                                Clytaemnestra as well as Aegisthus."}]}, {"@id": "cis7", "@type": "section", "@n": "7", "p": [{"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "@resp": "RCJ", "#text": "Summary."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "foot", "@n": "3", "@resp": "RCJ", "#text": "The influence of\n                                    Delphi on the poem of Stesichorus appears in the fact that\n                                    Apollo provides Orestes with the means of defence against the\n                                    Erinyes; and it is therefore not unlikely that the refuge of\n                                    Orestes was with Strophius at Crisa.

It would appear that Aeschylus followed the\n                                general outlines of Stesichorus pretty closely; while Sophocles, who\n                                did not do so, has retained at least one Stesichorean trait, the\n                                part of the old man.

But even if the hypothesis be rejected,\n                                there remains that fragment of the Stesichorean poem which describes\n                                Clytaemnestra's dream. This proves that Stesichorus conceived her in\n                                a manner which was much nearer to the Aeschylean than to the\n                                Homeric.

The home of\n                                    Pylades in the rich fields of Cirrha is\n                                    distinguished clearly from that of Strophius on the\n                                    foot (spur) of Parnassus, that is to say at\n                                    Crisa. Is this so? Pindar first designates the\n                                    Pythian festival by the words  ( 11. 12), and\n                                    presently adds that the victory of which he sings was won \n                                        ( 15). In\n                                     10. 15 f. the Pythian festival is similarly\n                                    designated as   : where  is clearly equivalent to the  of\n                                     5. 35, and the  of \n                                    6. 18. It is the spur of Parnassus under which Crisa was\n                                    situated: there was no such \n                                    or  near the site of Cirrha on\n                                    the gulf. And, by adding , Pindar interprets this large sense of\n                                        . In his time the town\n                                    of Cirrha no longer existed (see ). The plain in which\n                                    the Pythian games were held extended from the site of Cirrha on\n                                    the south to that of Crisa (the seat of Strophius) on the north.\n                                    It was called Cirrhaean as well as\n                                    Crisaean. Hence the festival could be\n                                    called the contest of Cirrha, and its\n                                    scene could also be identified with the cornlands of\n                                    Pylades. Was Euripides (in  917\n                                    f.) the first poet, as Mr Verrall suggests, who made Strophius a\n                                    brother-in-law, and Pylades a nephew, of Agamemnon? It seems\n                                    hardly probable. Anaxibia, daughter of Pleisthenes by\n                                    Arop, and sister of Agamemnon, was\n                                    mentioned by Hesiod (Tzetzes, , p.\n                                    68, 20); and as her only mythological function was to be the\n                                    wife of Strophius and the mother of Pylades, it may be supposed\n                                    that Hesiod knew those relationships. As we have seen, the\n                                    association of Pylades with Orestes dates at least from the\n                                         (\n                                    750 B.C.)."}], "title": ["Nostoi", "Oresteia."], "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "circ."}, "emph": "motive", "#text": "Three points in this sketch are noteworthy. (1) Pindar makes Orestes\n                                a Laconian; following the tradition, adopted\n                                also by Stesichorus and Simonides, that Amyclae in\n                                Lacedaemon was the place where Agamemnon was slain. (2) The house of Strophius, at the\n                                foot of Parnassus, is the refuge of Orestes; and Pylades\n                                is his friend. Probably the  ( 750 B.C.), in which Pylades figured,\n                                gave this account; but Pindar is the earliest extant source of\n                                    it.

It concerns the whole\n                                stamp of the drama, and illustrates the difference, in bent of\n                                genius, between the two poets. Aeschylus exhibits in grand outline\n                                the working of an eternal law, full of mystery and terror. Justice,\n                                Destiny, the Erinys, are the paramount agencies. The human agents\n                                are drawn, indeed, with a master's hand, but by a few powerful\n                                strokes rather than with subtle touches or fine shading. Nor is much\n                                care shown for probability in minor details of the plot. With\n                                Sophocles the interest depends primarily on the portraiture of human\n                                character. The opportunities for this are contrived by a series of\n                                ingenious situations, fruitful in contrasts and dramatic effects. We\n                                have seen that the Greek art of the sixth century B.C. knew a\n                                version of this legend in which Talthybius, the herald of Agamemnon,\n                                saved the young Orestes from murder,receiving him,\n                                doubtless, from the hands of the nurseand in due time\n                                conducted the heir home again; a version which Stesichorus had\n                                probably popularised. It suited Aeschylus to leave out Talthybius,\n                                while keeping the part of the nurse. Sophocles revives the old\n                                herald in the person of the trusty Paedagogus, who received the\n                                child, not from a nurse, but from Electra herself, and carried him\n                                to Crisa. This change is a source of large advantage to the plot. It\n                                is a weak point in the  that the story told\n                                by Orestes was not likely to impose upon Clytaemnestra, and does\n                                not, in fact, disarm her suspicion. The Sophoclean stratagem is of a\n                                different order. When the old man, as an envoy from Phanoteus, gives\n                                Clytaemnestra his circumstantial account of her son's death, he\n                                plays his part to perfection. He evinces some natural feeling for\n                                the tragic death of a brilliant youth, but at the same time shows\n                                that he is disappointed when the queen hesitates whether to rejoice\n                                or to mourn. Then it seems that I have come in\n                                vain, he says, half aggrieved; and she hastens to\n                                re-assure him. A little later the two Phocians\n                                arrive with the urn, as envoys from Strophius, the old ally of\n                                Agamemnon. This device of two independent missions, each from an\n                                appropriate quarter, was really fitted to win belief. It also\n                                provides a keen interest for the spectator, who is in the secret.\n                                The Aeschylean Electra is from the outset the accomplice of the\n                                avengers. But here she is herself deceived by them. And from the\n                                belief that her brother is dead springs the resolve which shows her\n                                spirit at the highestto execute the vengeance without\n                                aid.

For, although the pursuit of Orestes by the Erinyes was not\n                                to be included in the plot, still the play shows him both when he\n                                was meditating the deed, and after he has done it. Yet he neither\n                                shrinks from it in prospect, nor feels the slightest uneasiness when\n                                it has been accomplished.

How could an Athenian poet of the fifth\n                                century B.C. venture thus to treat the subject before an Athenian\n                                audience, whose general sentiment would assuredly be that of the\n                                    , and in the forefront of which sat\n                                priestly exponents of the religious view which was so signally ignored?\n                                Euripides is here, at least, at one with Aeschylus. True, Sophocles\n                                has been careful to remind us, again and again, how completely\n                                Clytaemnestra had forfeited all  claim to a son's\n                                loyalty. The question here is, however, not moral but religious; a\n                                matter, not of conduct, but of kinship. It may also be granted that\n                                the Sophoclean oracle of Apollo differs from that in the\n                                     It is a brief command to do a\n                                righteous deed; it threatens no penalties, and so implies no reason\n                                for reluctance. Still, that does not alter the fact of the\n                                matricidal stain upon Orestes. I do not know any adequate solution\n                                of this difficulty, which seems greater than has generally been\n                                recognised: I can only suggest one consideration which may help to\n                                explain it. The Homeric colouring in the  is\n                                strongly marked; thus the  is followed in the\n                                version of Agamemnon's murder as perpetrated at the\n                                banquet,there are even verbal echoes of it; the chariot-race in\n                                the  (book XXIII) has furnished several traits\n                                to the narrative of the disaster at the Pythian games. Sophocles seems to say to his audience,\n                                I give you, modified for drama, the story that Homer\n                                tells; put yourselves at the Homeric stand-point; regard the act of\n                                Orestes under the light in which the  presents\n                                it. The Homeric Athena declares that Orestes has won\n                                universal praise by slaying the villainous Aegisthus. The final\n                                scene of Sophocles is designed to leave a similar impression; the\n                                tyrant is exhibited in all his baseness,insolent and\n                                heartless; he is driven in to meet his just doom; Orestes points the\n                                moral; and the Chorus welcome the retribution. Having resolved to\n                                limit his view by the epic horizon, Sophocles has executed the plan\n                                with great skill. But his plot labours under a disadvantage which no\n                                skill could quite overcome. He could not, like his Homeric original,\n                                dispense with Apollo: the Apolline thread had long ago become so\n                                essential a part of the texture that he could not get rid of it.\n                                But, the moment that Apollo is introduced, the thought of the stain\n                                upon Orestes becomes importunate, since the very purpose for which\n                                Apollo first came into the story was that of showing how the supreme\n                                arbiter of purity could defend his emissary against the claim of the\n                                Erinyes. Stesichorus and Aeschylus had deeply impressed this on the\n                                Greek mind; and it would have been hard for Athenians, familiar with\n                                the lyric and the dramatic , to feel that the\n                                story, as told by Sophocles, reached a true conclusion.

Orestes slays Aletes, whose daughter Erigona goes to\n                                    Attica; and Pylades marries Electra. (Cp. Roscher,\n                                    p. 1238.)

Antigone is suddenly required to\n                                choose between omitting a sacred duty and incurring death; within a\n                                day she has chosen, and died. The ordeal of Electra is that of\n                                maintaining a solitary protest through years of suffering. Her timid\n                                sister's sympathy is only secret; the tyrants ill-treat her, and she\n                                witnesses their insults to her father's memory. Meanwhile there is\n                                only one feeble ray of light for her, the hope that Orestes may\n                                return; but it becomes fainter as time goes on. One of the finest\n                                traits in the delineation of Electra by Sophocles is the manner in\n                                which he suggests that inward life of the imagination into which she\n                                has shrunk back from the world around her. To her, the dead father\n                                is an ally ever watchful to aid the retribution; when she hears of\n                                Clytaemnestra's dream, it at once occurs to her that \n                                has helped to send it. The youthful Orestes, as her\n                                brooding fancy pictures him, is already invested with the heroic\n                                might of an avenger. There are moments when she can\n                                almost forget her misery in visions of his triumph. Like Antigone, she is contrasted with a weaker, though\n                                amiable, sister. Chrysothemis is of the same type as Ismene; her\n                                instincts are right, and respond to the appeal of Electra, whom she\n                                loves; only she is not heroic. The stronger nature, when brought\n                                into conflict with the feebler, almost inevitably assumes, at\n                                certain moments, an aspect of harshness: yet the union\n                                in Electra of tenderness with strength can be felt throughout, and\n                                finds expression in more than one passage of exquisite beauty. When she believes that Orestes is dead,\n                                and that it rests with her alone to avenge Agamemnon, she calls upon\n                                Chrysothemis to co-operate, who reproves her as forgetting that she\n                                is a woman. But when Orestes is restored to her, she\n                                submits herself in all things to his wishes. Hers is the part which\n                                Aeschylus gives to the Chorus, of speaking with Aegisthus on his way\n                                to the house. She is present almost from the beginning to the end of\n                                the play, and the series of her emotions is the thread which gives\n                                unity to the whole."}}, {"@id": "cis15", "@type": "section", "@n": "15", "p": [{"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "@resp": "RCJ", "#text": "Clytaemnestra."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "foot", "@n": "5", "@resp": "RCJ", "bibl": {"@n": "Aesch.

Sophocles\n                                portrays the queen in a manner very distinct from that of Aeschylus;\n                                a difference due not merely to the general tendencies of the poets,\n                                but also to the dramatic setting. Aeschylus created his\n                                Clytaemnestra in the , where she is seen\n                                just before and just after the murder. There is a fascination in her\n                                dreadful presence of mind; what an adamantine purpose can be felt\n                                under the fluent eloquence with which she welcomes her husband! How\n                                fearful, again, is her exultation in the deed, when she tells the\n                                Argive elders that she rejoices in the blood upon her robe\n                                as a cornfield in the dews of spring, or when she imagines Iphigeneia\n                                advancing to greet Agamemnon in the shades, and kissing him! Sophocles had to show\n                                Clytaemnestra, not at a crisis of action, but as she lived and felt\n                                in the years which followed her crime. Electra's fortitude was to be\n                                illustrated by withstanding and denouncing her. The Clytaemnestra of\n                                Aeschylus was ill-suited to such a situation. If she had been\n                                confronted with a daughter who impugned her deed, scorn and hatred\n                                would have flashed from her; but she would not have argued her case\n                                in detail, and then listened to a reply. The almost superhuman force\n                                of that dark soul would have been fatal to the dramatic effect of\n                                any woman opposed to her. In the  Aeschylus\n                                has taken care that Electra shall have no dialogue with\n                                Clytaemnestra. Sophocles clearly felt this. The Clytaemnestra whom\n                                he draws is strong and wicked, but her temperament is not one which\n                                separates her from ordinary humanity. She feels at least a pang of\n                                maternal grief when she first hears that Orestes is dead, even though a little later she can address heartless\n                                taunts to Electra. She has not the Aeschylean queen's cynical\n                                contempt for public opinion; thus she complains that Electra\n                                misrepresents her, and seeks to justify herself. When she meets her daughter in argument, she is\n                                forcible, but the better cause has the advantage which it\n                                    deserves.\n                                A desire to avenge Iphigeneia is the plea which she puts forward,\n                                and which Electra refutes; but the women of Mycenae had already\n                                given voice to the popular belief that guilty love was the true\n                                motive of the crime. Sophocles has thus avoided\n                                investing Clytaemnestra with a tragic interest which would have\n                                required that her punishment, rather than her paramour's, should\n                                form the climax."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "@resp": "RCJ", "#text": "The Chorus."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "foot", "@n": "1", "@resp": "RCJ", "quote": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "w)= po/lis,\n                                        w)= genea\\ k.t.l."}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "poli/tides"}], "#text": "Cp. the\n                                    words of the Chorus in v. 1413,  In v. 1227 Electra addresses them\n                                    as .

Then Electra sings a monody (112166);\n                                and she is presently joined by the Chorus (167). In the Sophoclean\n                                prologue also Orestes appears; then there is a monody for Electra\n                                (86120); and she is joined by the Chorus (121).

For, with him, the\n                                appearance of Orestes at that early moment is necessary; while, with\n                                Sophocles, there is no reason why Orestes should be seen until he is\n                                ready to enter the house. Again, the Chorus of Euripides have a\n                                motive for their visit; they invite Electra to a festival. But the\n                                Sophoclean Chorus come without any special cause.

Electra then\n                                comes forth and sings her monody. Euripides opens with a speech by\n                                the farmer, who next has a dialogue with Electra. They depart.\n                                Orestes enters with Pylades, to whom he makes a speech. Presently he\n                                sees a slave, as he thinks Electraapproaching.

The Sophoclean Parodos is a\n                                long ode of 129 verses, containing a discussion of Electra's wrongs\n                                and hopes, and of the course which she ought to pursue. The\n                                Euripidean Parodos consists of only 35 verses. The maidens briefly\n                                invite Electra, and she declines."}, "It seems to me, then, that the openings of the two plays entirely\n                                fail to support the critic's major premiss, viz., that one of them\n                                must have been imitated from the other.

Is it true\n                                that internal evidence points to Sophocles as the imitator? His\n                                Orestes, we are told, has no reason for appearing at the house\n                                before he is prepared to enter it. In defending a dramatist on such\n                                a point, it suffices, I suppose, to show that the action is natural\n                                and probable; we are not required to prove that it is necessary.\n                                Orestes and his companions have just arrived, and have hidden the\n                                urn somewhere near the house: the time is day-break. Is it strange\n                                that they should reconnoitre the ground on which they will soon have\n                                to act, or that the old man should point out the chief features of\n                                the scene? As to the poet's motive, that is evident. His invention\n                                of the double embassy from Phocis was a novelty, and he wished to\n                                give a clue to it at the outset, since the spectator, who is thus in\n                                the secret, will enjoy the play more. Again, it is said that\n                                Sophocles bewrays his model when he composes his Chorus of persons\n                                external to the house. A desire to vary from Aeschylus would account\n                                for this as easily as a desire to copy Euripides; but why should not\n                                the poet's motive have been independent of both? The free-born women\n                                of Mycenae are exponents of the public goodwill towards the rightful\n                                heir. But how, we are asked, had they become friends of Electra?\n                                Chrysothemis and Clytaemnestra tell us, it may be answered, that\n                                Electra frequently passed beyond the doors. Lastly, it is objected\n                                that the Chorus come to Electra without a definite reason. Is there\n                                not reason enough in their purpose of consoling and counselling\n                                her,the purpose which she gratefully acknowledges?", "Thus, even if the openings of the two plays could justly be regarded\n                                as showing a debt of either to the other, still there would be no\n                                presumption that Sophocles was the debtor.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "@resp": "RCJ", "#text": "Relation of Electra to\n                                    Clytaemnestra."}, "#text": "A further argument is, however, adduced in\n                                support of the view which we are discussing. Both Sophocles and\n                                Euripides bring Electra into controversy with Clytaemnestra. In the\n                                play of Euripides, the tenor of this controversy is such as to\n                                mitigate the odiousness of Clytaemnestra, and to emphasise the\n                                hardness of Electra. This was what Euripides meant to do. The aim of\n                                Sophocles was the opposite, to concentrate our sympathy upon\n                                Electra. But, says Prof. v. Wilamowitz, Sophocles has involuntarily\n                                given the advantage in dignity and self-command to Clytaemnestra;\n                                and this shows that he has (unskilfully) imitated Euripides. Is it\n                                true that the Clytaemnestra of Sophocles appears to more advantage\n                                than his Electra?

But, even if this were granted,\n                                the inference of an imitation would still be unwarranted, since the\n                                controversies in the two plays respectively differ both in topics\n                                and in style."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "@resp": "RCJ", "#text": "Argument from general\n                                    probability."}, "title": ["Electra", "Electra", "Choephori.", "Electra", "Electra"], "emph": "more", "#text": "Finally, let us consider the more general ground upon which  it is argued that Sophocles was stimulated\n                                to write his  by the work of Euripides. The\n                                Euripidean  is certainly a play which\n                                Sophocles would have viewed with repugnance. He would have thought\n                                that both the divine and the human persons were degraded. The\n                                earlier scenes, with their homely realism, approximate, in fact, to\n                                the stamp of the Middle Comedy. The whole treatment is a negation of\n                                that ideal art to which Sophocles had devoted his life. It is\n                                perfectly conceivable that such a piece should have roused him to\n                                make a protest,to show how the theme could once more be\n                                nobly treated, as Aeschylus long ago had treated it, and yet without\n                                raising the moral and religious problem of the\n                                 But is such a hypothesis \n                                probable than the converse? Suppose that the Sophoclean\n                                     was the earlier of the two. Is it not\n                                equally conceivable that Euripides should have been stirred to\n                                protest against the calm condonation of matricide? Might he not have\n                                wished to show how the subject could be handled without ignoring, as\n                                Sophocles does, this aspect of the vengeance, and also without\n                                refraining from criticism on the solution propounded by Aeschylus?\n                                This, in my belief, is what Euripides actually did wish to do.

Voltaire's\n                                 was produced in 1750. In the letter of\n                                dedication prefixed to it, he says that his aim is to restore a\n                                purer taste; and he thus describes the relation of his work to the\n                                Sophoclean. I have not copied the \n                                of Sophocles, far from it; but I have reproduced, as well\n                                as I could, its spirit and its substance. This is true; it is only in general outline\n                                that his plot resembles the other; the details are his own. The\n                                scene is laid near the tomb of Agamemnon, on the shore of the\n                                Argolic Gulf. Thither, from Argos, come Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra,\n                                to hold a festival; bringing with them\n                                Electra, their slave, with fetters on her wrists. On the same day,\n                                Orestes and Pylades are driven ashore at a neighbouring spot, and\n                                fall in with Pammne, a faithful old retainer of the house, who\n                                becomes their accomplice. The disguised Orestes, with Pylades,\n                                presents himself to Aegisthus, bearing a funeral urn. It contains,\n                                he says, the ashes of Orestes, whom he has slain at Epidaurus. There\n                                are, in fact, human ashes in the urn; but they are those of\n                                Plistne, the son of Aegisthus, whom his father had sent\n                                to kill Orestes. Presently Aegisthus learns by a message that his\n                                son is dead. He promptly arrests the two young strangers, and\n                                Pammne also. Meanwhile Orestes has met Electra at the\n                                tomb, and, overcome by affection and pity, has made himself known to\n                                her; though the oracle of Delphi had strictly forbidden him to do\n                                so. Electra now appeals to Clytaemnestratells her the\n                                secretand persuades her to intercede with Aegisthus, but\n                                without divulging her son's identity. Clytaemnestra complies.\n                                Aegisthusnow certain that Orestes is in his\n                                handsspurns her prayer, and sends the two youths to\n                                instant death.

He has caught up the\n                                hint given by Sophocles (vv. 766 ff.), and carried further by\n                                Euripides, that the murderess of Agamemnon may remain capable of\n                                tenderness for Orestes and Electra. The Clytaemnestra of Voltaire\n                                can be touched by the entreaties of her children, though she replies\n                                to their taunts with anger and scorn. The germ\n                                of this personage, he says, was in Sophocles\n                                and Euripides, and I have developed it. In doing so, he\n                                has gone a little too far; the cri du sang is\n                                somewhat too obtrusive and theatrical. Greek Tragedy, with its\n                                severe sanity, would have felt that there was extravagance in making\n                                Clytaemnestra intercede with Aegisthus for the life of one who could\n                                return only as an avenger. Nevertheless, the French dramatist has\n                                derived many touches of real beauty and pathos from this motive. His other\n                                chief innovation consists in rendering the course of the stratagem\n                                less smooth. Orestes and Pylades are placed in deadly peril. Our\n                                hopes and fears alternate almost to the end. The demand for this\n                                kind of interest is modern. An old Greek audience, familiar\n                                beforehand with the main lines of the story, could feel no anxiety\n                                for the safety of the hero. Voltaire's treatment of the urn-scene is\n                                noteworthy. He saw that here it was impossible to reproduce the\n                                Sophoclean pathos; that was only for people who had this custom in\n                                respect to the relics of the dead,a custom surrounded\n                                with sacred and tender associations. Voltaire substituted an\n                                interest of a different kind, the thrill felt by the\n                                spectators who know that the urn presented to Aegisthus contains the\n                                ashes of his son. The device is\n                                ingenious, but reduces the incident to a lower level; it is no\n                                longer a dramatic beauty, but rather a stroke of theatrical effect.\n                                A more serious departure from the ancient model is involved in his\n                                attempt to vindicate the gods. He refuses to conceive that they\n                                could have commanded an  man to slay his\n                                mother, however guilty she might be. In his version, they ultimately\n                                doom Orestes to do so; but only as a punishment. And for what? For\n                                having failed, through love and pity, to persevere in obedience to\n                                their arbitrary command against revealing him self to his\n                                    sister. This surely\n                                does not exhibit their justice in a more favourable light. So\n                                perilous is it to tamper with Greek Tragedy on this\n                                side,as Euripides, indeed, was the first to show. The\n                                inscrutable destiny interwoven with the legend is a thread which\n                                cannot be removed without marring the whole texture."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "@resp": "RCJ", "title": "Oreste", "#text": "The\n                                     of Alfieri."}}]}, {"@id": "cis23", "@type": "section", "@n": "23", "p": [{"title": "Oreste", "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "foot", "@n": "2", "@resp": "RCJ", "#text": "It was\n                                    published in 1783, when the poet was thirty-four years of\n                                age."}, "#text": "A lesson of a different kind is taught by the \n                                of Alfieri.

Sophocles is the classical poet who has chiefly influenced\n                                him in detail; but he owes still more to Voltaire. His Clytaemnestra\n                                is a woman broken down by misery and remorse; despised by Aegisthus;\n                                upbraided by Electra; vacillating between hysterical tenderness for\n                                her children and returns of the old passion for her paramour.\n                                Orestes arrives, with Pylades, and is recognised by Electra merely\n                                through the emotions which he manifests at the tomb of Agamemnon.\n                                The youths then announce, first to Clytaemnestra and afterwards to\n                                Aegisthus, the news that Orestes has been killed in a Cretan\n                                chariot-race. Aegisthus detects the fiction owing to the folly of\n                                Orestes, who, throughout the play, is incapable of self-control; he\n                                is perpetually reproved, or helped out of difficulties, by the more\n                                prudent Pylades. Aegisthus orders the young men to be executed, and\n                                dooms Electra to the same fate. They are saved, as with Voltaire, by\n                                an insurrection of the Argives. Orestes then takes the righteous\n                                vengeance. He slays Aegisthus, and at the same moment, in his blind\n                                fury, unconsciously deals a death-wound to Clytaemnestra, who is\n                                endeavouring to protect the tyrant. The play closes with his\n                                incipient madness, when he learns from Electra and Pylades that he\n                                has shed a mother's blood."}, {"title": ["Oreste", "Choephori", "Electra"], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "foot", "@n": "1", "@resp": "RCJ", "title": "Corinne", "quote": {"@lang": "fr", "emph": "le\n                                            caractre le plus austre.", "#text": "Alfieri, par un\n                                        hasard singulier, tait, pour ainsi dire,\n                                        transplant de l'antiquit dans les\n                                        temps modernes; il tait n pour agir,\n                                        et il n'a pu qu'crire...

(produced in 1856) is\n                                    cited a beautiful lament of Electra (), an echo of several passages in Sophocles."}], "#text": "Alfieri has a genuine, though limited, sympathy with the classical\n                                spirit, and, unlike most of his modern predecessors in the treatment\n                                of such themes, avoids everything that is positively incongruous\n                                with that spirit. It is the more instructive to observe the reason\n                                why he fails, in this , to be truly classical.\n                                An Attic tragedy, though severely simple in outline, owes much of\n                                its artistic charm to those minor incidents which diversify the\n                                plot, and to those secondary persons who serve as foils or contrasts\n                                to the chief actors. The part of the Nurse in the\n                                 is a small one, and yet how much the play\n                                would lose if it were omitted! In the  of\n                                Sophocles, the Old Man is not merely a link in a chain of agency,\n                                but a source of dramatic interest: and the portraiture of the\n                                heroine herself is the more vivid because Chrysothemis is placed at\n                                her side. It is this variety and relief, this skilful use of\n                                undertones, that we miss in the work of the Italian dramatist. He\n                                has cut out everything that is not indispensable. Without deviation\n                                or pause, the action pursues its direct, but somewhat monotonous\n                                    course. There are\n                                occasional beauties, but the general effect is\n                                not that of a Greek drama; it is rather that of an abridgement from\n                                such a work.

As might have been\n                                expected, the Aeschylean trilogy has been the most influential.

Electra's exclamation of joy\n                                    (411) caused Chrysothemis to ask if her sister had any ground\n                                    for hope (412).

The words  (428 ff.) show the\n                                    train of her thought. To Chrysothemis, the alarm of\n                                    Clytaemnestra (427) is more important than the apparition of\n                                    Agamemnon.

For\n                                    the attempts to amend this v., see Appendix. The criticism of\n                                    vv. 690692 turns upon these points. (1) The word\n                                         cannot be right. At\n                                    each festival there was only one . The plur. cannot be defended on the ground\n                                    that a winner of the  might\n                                    have to run twice, viz., first in one of several\n                                    groups, and then in the final heat ( ). (2) If the sing.  be read, it is still difficult\n                                    to complete the verse in any probable manner. (3) Omitting\n                                        , we might expand  on the\n                                    hypothesis that the intrusion of  had caused the mischief: , . Pindar often uses  as=. (4) But it seems more probable that v. 691 is\n                                    an interpolation, arising perhaps from a marginal gloss, and\n                                    intended to explain a general phrase in the text. Thus, if the\n                                    poet had written simply,    etc., then the\n                                    reference to the diaulos and the pentathlon in v. 691 might have\n                                    been prompted by a wish to define . And the interpolation would itself account for\n                                    the change of  in 692 to\n                                        . (Some, indeed, think it\n                                    enough to delete 691, leaving : but the neut. plur. of the pron. seems too\n                                    vague here.) (5) Nauck's view, that the poet wrote, \n                                      etc.,\n                                    leaves two difficulties. () There would then have\n                                    been less excuse for interpolating an allusion to the\n                                    pentathlon. () The tone of vv. 688 f. would lead\n                                    us to suppose that the  of Orestes had not been confined to footraces,\n                                    but had included some feats in the other branches of the ."}, {"quote": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "tou/twn"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)/qlwn"}], "#text": "On the whole, I should incline to delete 691, and alter  in 692 to ."}]}, {"@id": "cl692", "@type": "commLine", "@n": "692", "p": [{"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "e)negkw\\n"}, "bibl": {"@n": "Soph.
