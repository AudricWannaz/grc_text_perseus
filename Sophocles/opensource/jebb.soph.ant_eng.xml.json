Antigone's heroism presupposes a legend that burial had been refused to Polyneices. Pindar knows nothing of such a refusal. He speaks of the seven funeral pyres provided at Thebes for the seven divisions of the Argive army. Similarly Pausanias records a Theban legend that the corpse of Polyneices was burned on the same pyre with that of Eteocles, and that the very flames refused to mingle. The refusal of burial was evidently an Attic addition to the story.  It served to contrast Theban vindictiveness with Athenian humanity; for it was Theseus who ultimately buried the Argives at Eleusis. If Creon's edict, then, was an Attic invention, it may be conjectured that Antigone's resolve to defy the edict was also the conception of an Attic poet. Aeschylus is the carliest author who refers to the edict against burial, and he is also the first who tells of Antigone's resolve. His Theban trilogy consisted of the , the , and the . At the end of the last play a herald proclaims an edict just published by the Council of Thebes; sepulture shall be given to Eteocles, but denied to Polyneices.

The Chorus represents average civic opinion; and one half of the Chorus openly defies the decree. A plot which began thus could scarcely end in the Council taking the heroine's life. It rather foreshadows a final solution which shall be favourable to her; and we might surmise that, in loosing the knot, Aeschylus would have resorted to a divine mandate or intervention.

Has not Antigone already rendered burial rites to him; is it not precisely for that action that she is dying? Antigone had, indeed, given symbolical sepulture to Polyneices by sprinkling dust upon the corpse, and pouring libations. The performance of that act discharged her personal duty towards the dead and the gods below; it also saved her dead brother from the dishonour (which would else have been a reproach to him in the other world) of having been neglected by his nearest kinsfolk on earth. But Antigone's act did not clear Creon. Creon's duty to the dead and to the gods below was still unperformed. So far as Creon was concerned, Polyneices was still unburied. And Creon's obligation could not be discharged, as Antigone's had been, merely by the symbolical act, which religion accepted only when a person was unavoidably hindered from performing regular rites. There was nothing to hinder Creon from performing such rites. These were still claimed from him. After Antigone's tribute had been rendered, birds and dogs had been busy with the corpse. Creon's duty to the dead and to the gods below was now also a duty towards the polluted State, from which his impiety had alienated the gods above.", "In reply to the friendly and earnest warning of Teiresias, Creon angrily accuses the seer of mercenary complicity in a disloyal plot; malcontent Thebans wish to gain a triumph over their king by frightening him into a surrender. Never will be grant burial rites to Polyneices.", "Teiresias, angered in his turn, then declares the penalty which the gods reserve for such obduracy. With the life of his own son shall Creon atone for his twofold sin,the detention of the dead among the living, and the imprisonment of the living in the abode of the dead. The seer then departs.", "Creon is deeply moved. In the course of long and eventful years he has learned a lesson which is present also to the minds of the Theban elders. The word of Teiresias has never failed to come true.", "After a hurried consultation with the Chorus, Creon's resolve is taken. He will yield.

Is there not something a little improbable in the celerity with which Creon,hitherto inflexible,is converted by the threats of a seer whom he has just been denouncing as a venal impostor? Granting that experience had attested the seer's infallibility when speaking in the name of the gods, has not Creon professed to believe that, in this instance, Teiresias is merely the mouthpiece of disloyal Thebans? The answer will be found by attentively observing the state of mind which, up to this point, has been portrayed in Creon. He has, indeed, been inflexible; he has even been vehement in asserting his inflexibility. But, under this vehemence, we have been permitted to see occasional glimpses of an uneasy conscience. One such glimpse is at , where he protests that  hands are clean in regard to Antigone;he had given her full warning, and he has not shed her blood,but at any rate (,i.e., wherever the guilt rests)she shall die. Another such trait occurs at , where he says that he will not bury Polyneices, though the throne of Zeus in heaven should be defiled,quickly adding, for I know that no mortal can pollute the gods. It may further be remarked that a latent self-mistrust is suggested by the very violence of his rejoinder to the Chorus, when they venture, with timid respect, to hint the possibility that some divine agency may have been at work in the mysterious tribute paid to Polyneices (278 f.). A like remark applies to the fury which breaks out at moments in his interviews with Haemon and with Teiresias. The delicacy of the dramatic tact which forbids these touches to be obtrusive is such as Sophocles, alone of the Attic masters, knew how to use.

The dramatic fault here has nothing to do with any estimate of the chances that Creon might actually have saved Antigone's life, if he had gone to her first. The poet might have chosen to imagine her as destroying herself immediately after she had been left alone in her cell. In any case, the margin for Creon must have been a narrow one. The dramatic fault is that, while we, the spectators, are anxious that Antigone should be saved, and while every moment is precious, we are left to conjecture why Creon should be spending so many of these moments in burial rites which could have been rendered equally well after Antigone had been rescued: nay, when the rites have been finished, he remains to build a mound. The source of pathos contained in the words too late is available for Tragedy, but evidently there is one condition which must be observed. A fatal delay must not seem to be the result merely of negligence or of caprice. As Bellermann has justly said, modern drama has obeyed this rule with a heedfulness not always shown by the ancients.

The speech of the first Messenger in the  () relates the catastrophe with which the tragedy culminates. Its effect was therefore of the highest importance. Now, if this speech had first related the terrible scene in Antigone's tomb, and had then passed on to the quiet obsequies of Polyneices, its rhetorical impressiveness would have been destroyed. It was indispensable that the latter part of the recital should correspond with the climax of tragic interest. This, I believe, was the motive present to the poet's mind when, after indicating in the dialogue that the release was to precede the burial, he reversed that order in composing the Messenger's speech. He knew that his Athenian audience would be keenly susceptible to the oratorical quality of that speech, while they would be either inattentive, or very indulgent, to the defect in point of dramatic consistency.

Some modern estimates of the play have seemed to assume that such refusal of sepulture, though a harsh measure, was yet one which the Greek usage of the poet's age recognised as fairly applicable to public enemies, and that, therefore, Creon's fault lay merely in the degree of his severity. It is true that the legends of the heroic age afford some instances in which a dead enemy is left unburied, as a special mark of abhorrence. This dishonour brands the exceptionally base crime of Aegisthus Yet these same legends also show that, from a very early period, Hellenic feeling was shocked at the thought of carrying enmity beyond the grave, and withholding those rites on which the welfare of the departed spirit was believed to depend. The antiquity of the maxim that, after a battle, the conquerors were bound to allow the vanquished to bury their dead, is proved by the fact that it was ascribed either to Theseus or to Heracles. Achilles maltreated the dead Hector. Yet, even there, the  expresses the Greek feeling by the beautiful and touching fable that the gods themselves miraculously preserved the corpse from all defacement and from all corruption, until at last the due obsequies were rendered to it in Troy. The Atreidae refused burial to Ajax; but Odysseus successfully pleaded against the sentence, and Ajax was ultimately buried with all honour. In giving that issue to his play, Sophocles was doing what the general feeling of his own age would strongly demand. Greeks of the fifth century B.C. observed the duty towards the dead even when warfare was bitterest, and when the foe was barbarian. The Athenians buried the Persians slain at Marathon, as the Persians buried the Lacedaemonians slain at Thermopylae.

Where the unanimous opinion of the community was ignored, the Athenians of the poet's day would feel that, as Haemon says, there was no city at all. Indeed, when Creon summoned the conference of elders, that summons was itself an admission that he was morally bound to take account of other judgments besides his own. We may often notice in the Attic drama that the constitutional monarchy of the legendary heroic age is made to act in the spirit, and speak in the tone, of the unconstitutional , as the historical age knew it. This was most natural; it gave an opening for points sure to tell with a tyrant-hating Athenian audience, and it was perfectly safe from objection on the ground of anachronism,an objection which was about the last that Athenian spectators were likely to raise, if we may judge by the practice of the dramatists. Now, the Creon of the , though nominally a monarch of the heroic age, has been created by the Attic poet in the essential image of the historical  The Attic audience would mentally compare him, not to an Agamemnon or an Alcinous, but to a Hippias or a Periander.

In the opening scene of the play, we find her possessed by a burning indignation at the outrage done to her dead brother; the deep love which she feels for him is braced by a clear sense of the religious duty which this edict lays upon her, and by an unfaltering resolve to do it; it never occurs to her for an instant that, as a true sister, she could act otherwise; rather it seems wonderful to her that the author of the edict should even have expected it to prove deterrentfor  ()."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "@resp": "RCJ", "#text": "Her relation to Ismene."}, "emph": "to be over-busy", "quote": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "perissa\\ pra/ssein"}, "bibl": {"@n": "Soph.

And how does Ismene meet her? Ismene reminds her that other members of their house have perished miserably, and that, if Antigone acts thus, Antigone and she will die more miserably still: they are women, and must not strive with men; they are subjects, and must not strive with rulers: Ismene will ask the dead to excuse her, since she is constrained, and will obey the living: for it is witless  (, ). Ismene is amiable enough; she cannot be called exceptionally weak or timid; she is merely the average woman; her answer here is such as would have been made by most womenand perhaps by a still larger proportion of men, as the Chorus afterwards forcibly reminds us. But, given the character and the present mood of Antigone, what must be the effect of such a reply to such an appeal? It is the tenderness, quite as much as the strength, of Antigone's spirit that speaks in her answer:I will not urge thee,no, nor, if thou yet shouldst have the mind, wouldst thou be welcome as a worker with me.

Was Antigone to indulge Ismene's impulse, and to allow Ismene's words to confirm Creon's suspicions? Surely Antigone was bound to do what she does,namely, to speak out the truth: Nay, Justice will not suffer thee to do that; thou didst  consent to the deed, neither did I give thee part in it. But it will be said that her tone towards Ismene is too stern and hard. The sternness is only that of truth; the hardness is only that of reality: for, among the tragic circumstances which surround Antigone, this is precisely one of the most tragic, that Ismene's earlier conduct, at the testing-point of action,  made a spiritual division which no emotional after-impulse can cancel. One more point may be raised: when Ismene says, What life is dear to me, bereft of thee?Antigone replies, Ask Creonall thy care is for him (): is not this, it may be asked, a needless taunt?

Creon might well think that, after all, the fact was as he suspected. It was necessary for Antigone to make him seeby some trenchant utterancethat she regarded Ismene as distinctly ranged on his side. And she succeeded.

It is evident that, if Sophocles had given greater prominence to Antigone's love for Haemon, he could have had only one aim, consistently with the plan of this play,viz., to strengthen our sense of the ties which bound her to life, and, therefore, of her heroism in resigning it. But it is also evident that he could have done this, with any effect, only at the cost of depicting a mind divided between the desire of earthly happiness and the resolve to perform a sacred duty. Sophocles has preferred to portray Antigone as raised above every selfish thought, even the dearest, by the absorbing and inspiring sense of her duty to the dead, and to the gods; silent, not through apathy, concerning a love which could never be hers, and turning for comfort to the faith that, beyond the grave, the purest form of human affection would reunite her to those whom she had lost. It is no blame to later dramatists that they found it necessary to make more of the love-motive; but, if our standard is to be the noblest tragic art, it is a confession of their inferiority to Sophocles. There is a beautiful verse in the play which might suggest how little he can have feared that his heroine would ever be charged with a cold insensibility. Creon has urged that the honour which she has shown to Polyneices will be resented by the spirit of Eteocles. Antigone answers, It is not my nature to join in hating, but in loving.

The strength of exaltation has passed away; her clear intelligence cannot refuse to acknowledge that the actual results of doing right are in seeming conflict with the faith which was the sanction of the deed.

Anarchy is the worst evil that can befall a State: the first duty of a ruler is therefore to enforce law and maintain order. The safety of the individual depends on that of the State, and therefore every citizen has a direct interest in obedience. This obedience must be absolute and unquestioning.

In the scholia at the end of L we also read, this play differs from the  of Euripides in the fact that, there, she was detected through the love of Haemon, and was given in marriage; while here the issue is the contrary (i.e. her death). That this is the right rendering of the scholiast's words seems probable from a comparison with the statement in the Argument; though others have understood, she was detected, and, owing to the love of Haemon, given in marriage. She was detected, not, as in the play of Sophocles, directly by Creon's guards, but (in some way not specified) through the fact that Haemon's love for her had drawn him to her side. Welcker ( II. pp. 563 ff.) has sought to identify the  of Euripides with the plot sketched by Hyginus in . Antigone having been detected, Haemon had been commissioned by Creon to slay her, but had saved her, conveying her to a shepherd's home. When Maion, the son of their secret marriage, had grown to man's estate, he visited Thebes at a festival. This was the moment (Welcker thinks) at which the  of Euripides began. Creon noted in Maion a certain mark which all the offspring of the dragon's seed () bore on their bodies. Haemon's disobedience was thus revealed; Heracles vainly interceded with Creon; Haemon slew his wife Antigone and then himself.

The first represents a group of three figures,the central figure being an old man who has just doffed the mask of a young maiden,while a guard, spear in hand, seizes him by the neck. This is explained as a comic parody of Antigone's story; she has sent an old servant to perform the task in her stead, and he, when confronted with Creon, drops his disguise. The other vase-painting,of perhaps ,represents Heracles interceding with Creon, who is on the hero's right hand, while Antigone and Haemon are on his left. Eurydic, Ismene, and a youth (perhaps Maion, the offspring of Antigone's marriage with Haemon) are also present. Klgmann refers this picture to the lost play of Euripides. Heydemann (with more probability, I think) supposes it to represent a scene from an otherwise unknown drama, of which he recognises the plot in Hyginus (). It is briefly this:Haemon has disobeyed Creon by saving Antigone's life; Heracles intercedes with Creon for Haemon, but in vain; and the two lovers commit suicide. Professor Rhousopoulos, of Athens, in a letter to the French Academy (), describes a small fragment of a ceramic vase or cup, which he believes to have been painted in Attica, about , by (or after) a good artist. The fragment shows the beautiful face of a maiden,the eyes bent earnestly on some object which lies before her. This object has perished with the rest of the vase. But the letters  remain; and it is certain that the body of Polyneices was the sight on which the maiden was gazing. As Prof. Rhousopoulos ingeniously shows, the body must have been depicted as resting on sloping ground, the lowest slope, we may suppose, of the hill upon which the guards sat (). The moment imagined by the artist may have been that at which Antigone returned, to find that the body had been again stripped of dust ().

The Milesians, having been worsted, denounced the Samians to the Athenians; who required that both parties should submit their case at Athens. This the Samians refused to do. The Athenians then sent forty ships to Samos,put down the oligarchy there,and established a democracy in its place. (2) The second expedition had to deal with Samos in open rebellion.

He sailed at once to Samos, with sixty ships. All his nine colleagues went with him.

His deme, Colonus, belonged to the Antiochis, and therefore his name ought to have come last. But Androtion puts it second. The explanation is simple. When the ten tribes were increased to twelve, by the addition of the Antigonis and Demetrias (in or about ), some of the demes were transferred from one tribe to another. Among these was the deme of Colonus. It was transferred from the Antiochis, the tenth on the roll, to the Aegeis, the second on the roll.

At first sight, a modern reader is apt to be reminded of the man of letters who, in the opinion of his admirer, would have been competent, at the shortest notice, to assume command of the Channel Fleet. It may appear grotesque that an important State should have rewarded poetical genius by a similar appointment. But here, as in other cases, we must endeavour to place ourselves at the old Athenian point of view. The word general, by which we render strategus, suggests functions purely military, requiring, for their proper discharge, an elaborate professional training. Such a conception of the Athenian strategia would not, however, be accurate. The ten strategi, chosen annually, formed a board of which the duties were primarily military, but also, in part, civil. And, for the majority of the ten, the military duties were usually restricted to the exercise of control and supervision at Athens. They resembled officials at the War Office, with some added functions from the province of the Home Office. The number of strategi sent out with an army or a fleet was, at this period, seldom more than three. It was only in grave emergencies that all the ten strategi went on active service together. In ,the time, as it seems, when Sophocles was elected,no one could have foreseen the great crisis at Samos. In an ordinary year Sophocles, as one of the strategi, would not necessarily have been required to leave Athens. Among his nine colleagues there were doubtless, besides Pericles, one or two more possessed of military aptitudes, who would have sufficed to perform any ordinary service in the field. Demosthenesin whose day only one of the ten strategi was ordinarily commissioned for wardescribes the other nine as occupied, among other things, with arranging the processions for the great religious festivals at Athens. He deplores, indeed, that they should be so employed; but it is certain that it had long been one duty of these high officials to help in organising the great ceremonies. We are reminded how suitable such a sphere of duty would have been for Sophocles,who is said to have led in his boyhood the Chorus that celebrated the victory of Salamis,and we seem to win a new light on the meaning of his appointment to the strategia. In so far as a strategus had to do with public ceremonies and festivals, a man with the personal gifts of Sophocles could hardly have strengthened his claim better than by a brilliant success at the Dionysia. The mode of election was favourable to such a man. It was by show of hands in the Ecclesia. If the  was produced at the Great Dionysia, late in , it is perfectly intelligible that the poet's splendid dramatic triumph should have contributed to his election in the following May. It is needless to suppose that his special fitness for the office was suggested to his fellow-citizens by the special maxims of administration which he ascribes to Creon,a notion which would give an air of unreality,verging, indeed, on comedy,to a result which appears entirely natural when it is considered in a larger way."}]}, {"@id": "ci1s21", "@type": "section", "@n": "21", "p": {"title": ["Antigone", "Antigone.", "Ajax", "Medea"], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "@resp": "RCJ", "#text": "Internal evidence for an early date."}, "quote": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)ntilabh/"}, "emph": ["a", "b", "c"], "ref": {"@target": "cl100", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "vv. 100-161"}, "bibl": [{"@n": "Soph.

The Greek love of antithesis naturally tended to expressions like our by hook or by crook, by fair means or foul, for love or money, good or bad, etc.   (n.): , which is plainly colloquial,meaning who will not hold his peace on any terms; for though  suits the recent  of Dionysus,  could not mean definitely, as a free agent. Similarly we may suppose that some such phrase as  () was familiar as=by no possible means. If  is sound, the poet has refined a colloquialism by modifying  into , just as  (cp. ) appears in  as . Some find a reference to weaving;by loosening the web, or fastening a new thread; but, though the phrase may have been first suggested by the loom, it was probably used without any such conscious allusion. Quite different from our passage is , not to embroil the feud, but to help in solving it: cp. ; to loose the knot of controversy. Another view makes the phrase refer to Creon's edict: seeking to undo it, or ,i.e. to break it, or to make it more stringent than it already is (schol. ).

Nor can the epithet be explained as enfeebling all, in the sense of subduing them; nor, again, as attending on all, even to old age. The neighbourhood of  is not in favour of , but against it; in the case of  (360), and of  (370), there is a direct contrast between the two words. Either  or  (see cr. n.) would be good, if  could be taken from the next verse, and added to this. But  clearly belongs, I think, to the next verse,as will be seen presently. Bamberger proposed , or . The former would be a subst. like , fisherman, , fowler: the latter (which I should prefer), an adj. like , catching much (Heliodorus 5. 18), , having good sport.  would suit the sense well. But its probability depends on the way in which we conceive the corrupt  to have arisen. It is evident that the genuine  in the next line had something to do with it. It seems most likely that the eye of the transcriber who first wrote  had wandered to , and that by a mere inadvertence he gave a like ending to the earlier word. Now this might most easily have happened if the sixth letter of the earlier series had been , but would obviously have been less likely if that letter had been . I therefore think it more probable that  arose from  than from . It is immaterial that the last four letters of the latter are nearer to the MS., since, on the view just stated, the transcriber's error arose from the fact that the consecutive letters  were common to  and , and that, from these letters onwards, he accidentally copied . It may be added that such an error would have been easier with a separate word like  than with the second part of a compound like .The verb , to catch (common both in verse and in prose) is used by  Soph. in fr. 507.

The siteat a place called Dionysois proved by local inscriptions, found by members of the American School in 1888. The story was that, when Dionysus first entered Attica, he was received at Icaria by Icarius, whom he taught to make wine. Icaria was associated with the earliest celebrations of the rural Dionysia (thus the , or dancing on greased wine-skins, was said to have been introduced by Icarius himself), and with the infancy of Attic drama in both kinds,as it was also the birth-place of Thespis , and, at a later time, of the comic poet Magnes.
