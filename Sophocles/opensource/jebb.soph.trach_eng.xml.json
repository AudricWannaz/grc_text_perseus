Yet there has never been a lack of more favourable estimates. In the very year when Schlegel was lecturing at Vienna (1808), Boeckh pointed out the strong family likeness between this and the other six plays;  Jacob A. made a direct reply to Schlegel's censures; and Godfrey Hermann said that, whatever faults the work might have, at any rate both the spirit and the diction  were unmistakably those of Sophocles. During the last half century, with the growth of a better aesthetic criticism in relation to all things Hellenic, a sense of the great beauties in the  has decidedly prevailed over the tendency to exaggerate its defects; indeed, the praise bestowed upon it, in these latter days, has sometimes perhaps been a little too indiscriminate. The play is in fact an exceptionally difficult one to appreciate justly; and the root of the difficulty is in the character of the fable.

The earliest evidence for it is afforded by the temple of Zeus at Olympia, about 450 B.C. The twelve labours were there portrayed on the metopes,six on those of the western front, and six on those of the eastern. All the twelve subjects are known from the existing remains. The list agrees, in much the larger part, with twelve labours  enumerated by the Chorus in the  of Euripides, a play of which the date may be placed about 421416 B.C. Neither list knows any places, outside of Peloponnesus, except Crete and Thrace; nor does either list recognise any of those later myths in which Heracles symbolises the struggles of Argos with Sparta. In both lists the journey to the Hesperides has lost its original meaning,the attainment of immortality,since it precedes the capture of Cerberus. These are some reasons for thinking that a cycle of twelve labours had become fixed in Dorian legend long before the fifth century B.C. The Dorians of Argclis were those among whom it first took shape, as the scenes of the labours show. But nothing is known as to the form in which it first became current."}, "One thing, however, is plain. Although the twelve tasks are more or less independent of each other, the series has the unity of a single idea. Heracles is the destroyer of pests on land and sea, the saviour of Argolis first and then the champion of humanity, the strong man who secures peace to the husbandman and an open path to the sailor: with his club and his bow, he goes forth against armed warriors, or monsters of superhuman  malignity, reliant on his inborn might, and conscious of a divine strain in his blood. This is no Achilles, no image of that chivalry which Aeolian legend had delineated and Ionian poetry adorned; no steeds, swift as the wind, bear his chariot into battle; no panoply of bronze, wrought by Hephaestus, flashes on him, like the gleam of blazing fire, or of the sun as it arises: in the gentle graces of human existence, in the softer human sympathies, he has no portion; no music of the lyre soothes his rest in the camp; he has never known such tears as came into the eyes of the young Achaean warrior, when the aged king of Troy, kneeling at his feet, kissed the hand that had slain Hector; nor has he anything of that peculiar pathos which is given alike to Hector and to Achilles by the dim presage of an early doom, the uncertain shadow which now and again flits across the meridian of their glory; the golden scales, lifted in the hand of Zeus, have never trembled with the fate of Heracles, for his destiny was fixed before his birth, and is inseparable from his origin,that he must toil while he lives, and must live until his task has been accomplished. He embodies a sterner ideal; one in which there is less of spiritual charm and of flexible intelligence, but which has a moral grandeur of its own; we might say that relatively to the Ionian view of life it is as the Hebraic ideal to the Hellenic. And this ideal may rightly be called Dorian, in the sense that it presumably represents a conception of the primitive Dorian folk, bearing a general stamp which can be traced in historical expressions of the Dorian nature.", "That conception appears in only two other sets of legends besides the Argive.

Argive tradition claimed his manhood; and this claim could not be ignored. Nor was it disputed that he sprang from the Argive Perseidae. The Boeotians sought only to reconcile his Argive lineage with a belief that he was born at Thebes. Alcmena, his mother, is the daughter of Electryon, king of Mycenae: she is betrothed to her firstcousin Amphitryon, son of Alcaeus, king of Tiryns. Amphi tryon accidentally kills his uncle, Electryon, and flies, with Alcmena, to Thebes. She requires him, as the condition of their union, to avenge her on the Taphii in western Greece, who have slain her brothers. He sets forth from Thebes to do so. Just before his triumphant return, Zeus visits Alcmena in his likeness, and becomes the father of Heracles. Amphitryon was originally a Theban hero; but the Thebans made him an Argive in order that they might make Heracles a Theban. The name Heracles is itself a proof that Argive legend was predominant enough to extort such a compromise. Hera was the goddess of the pre-Dorian Argos. The story of her hatred towards the Dorian Heracles expressed the hostility of her worshippers to the Dorian invaders. But, when the Dorians had conquered, their legendary champion came to be called , the glorified of Hera; not in the sense that he had won fame by surmounting her persecutions, or through her final reconciliation to him in Olympus; but in the sense that he was the pride of the city which, though it had changed its earthly masters, was still Hera'sthe now Dorian Argos. The old story of her spite against him lived on in poetry, but it had lost its first meaning. It is recorded that an earlier name of Heracles had been Alcaeus, the man of might; and traces of this lingered in Boeotia."}, "There, too, as in Argolis, the myth is blended with facts of local warfare; Heracles fights for Thebes against the Minyae of Orchomenus. But the true Dorian Heracles is seen in other parts of the Theban story,as when he strangles the snakes in his cradle, and slays the lion of Cithaeron. His last act at Thebes is that which he does in the madness sent on him by Hera,the slaughter of the children borne to him by Megara, daughter of Creon. This Theban tradition was another compromise with Argive legend, which claimed his best years for the twelve labours. How, then, was he to be severed from Thebes, the home of his youth? He must be forced to fly from it, as blood-guiltythe guilt being excused by Hera's visitation. Further, Thebes had to account for the non-existence of Theban nobles claiming a direct descent from him. Therefore he slew his Theban children.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "@resp": "RCJ", "#text": "Thessalian legends."}, "#text": "Lastly, there are the Thessalian legends. These belong especially to Trachis, the chief town of Malis, and to the neighbouring region of Mount Oeta. Here, too, there is an element of disguised history; Heracles is the friend of Dorians; he works for the honour of Apollo, the god of the Thessalo-Delphic amphictyony; he conquers aliens, like Cycnus, or establishes good relations with them, as with the Trachinian king Cex. But the spirit of an older conception animates one part of the Thessalian legend,the hero's fiery death on the summit of Oeta, when Zeus receives him into heaven. The journey to the Hesperides was probably an older symbol of immortality attained after toil; but if that fable has the charm of the sunset, the legend of Oeta has the grandeur of the hills."}, {"title": "Trachiniae", "#text": "These three cycles of myth,the Argive, the Boeotian, and the Thessalian,alone reveal the true old-Dorian Heracles.

Yet in  the  there is but one mention of Apollo,where the Chorus briefly invokes him (v. 209). Throughout the play, Zeus is the god of Heracles, the ruler of his destiny, the sole recipient of his offerings. Nor is Delphi ever named; Heracles receives oracles either directly from Zeus, or from the interpreters of Zeus at Dodona. This is thoroughly true to the spirit of the myth; and it is probable that the Dorian conception of Heracles was, in fact, older than the Dorian cult of Apollo. The archaic conception of the hero's mission is also preserved in its leading features; he is the purger of land and sea, the common benefactor of Hellenes, who goes uncomplainingly whithersoever his fate leads him. Conscious of his origin, he fears no foe, and is stronger than everything except his own passions. He has a Dorian scorn for lengthy or subtle speech (). It is bitter to him that sheer pain should force him to cry aloud: and he charges Hyllus that no lament shall be made by those who stand around his pyre. All this is in the strain of the old legend. One small touch recalls, for a moment, the Heracles of the satyr-plays (v. 268, ). On the other hand, the Omphal incident, one of their favourite topics, is touched with delicate skill: Sophocles alludes only to the  done for her by the hero, as a punishment imposed by Zeus; there is no hint of sensuous debasement; and it is seen that the thrall was stung by his disgrace, even though that feeling was not the mainspring of his war upon Oechalia."}, {"title": "Trachiniae", "emph": "a", "#text": "The Heracles of the  is thus not merely  hero of tragedy, who might equally well have been called, let us say, Ajax.

Meanwhile, we have been rather prepossessed against Heracles; he is a great hero; but his conduct to this brave, devoted, gentle wife has been what, in another than the son of Zeus, might be called brutal; and let no one too hastily assume that such a feeling is peculiar to the modern mind; it would probably have been shared, at least in a very large measure, by the poet's Athenian audience.", "So, when, in the last third of the play, this hero at length appears, unstrung and shattered by physical torment,helpless in the meshes of fate,when we listen to his pathetic laments, and to that magnificent recital of his past achievements which ends with the prayer that he may live to rend his false wife in pieces;then we feel, indeed, all that is pitiable and terrible in this spectacle: but are there not many readers who, if they carried the analysis of their own feelings any further, would have to avow that the contemplation of his suffering and the thought of his past greatness leave them comparatively cold? Presently he learns that Deianeira was innocent, and that she is dead; but he utters no word in revocation of his judgment upon her,no word of affection for her memory: he merely averts all his thoughts from her, and concentrates them on the preparation for death. It is not enough to plead that any softening would be out of keeping with the situation or with the man; we do not require him to be tender, but to be human.

The artistic unity of the tragedy demanded this. But the Heracles of Dorian legend, even when  treated as mortal, is still no typical human being; he is at once above and below the noblest type of man. If, therefore, Heracles was truly to dominate the scene, it was requisite that the pathos of this unique being should not have to compete with the deepest pathos of humanity.

That was the opinion of an accomplished judge in such matters, the late Mr Fleeming Jenkin; and I, for one, certainly should not dispute it. The intrinsic merits of the Heracles part are great; and a Salvini, or even an actor who was not quite a Salvini, could, no doubt, make the spectacle most impressive. But, even if he could make it absorbingso that we should think only of what was passing before our eyes, and not at all of what had gone before in the play, the episode of Deianeirathat might be merely an instance of theatrical effect prevailing over the dramatic conscience. It would not necessarily prove that the tragedy, viewed as a work of art,and therefore viewed as a whole,was not really liable to the criticism suggested above.

Hence we readily comprehend the words in which Sophocles (according to Plutarch) defined the third, the final, phase of his style;: the kind of diction  which is most expressive of character, and best; that is, fittest to make each person of the drama seem a real human being; and best, therefore, for the purposes of a dramatist."}, {"title": ["Philoctetes", "Antigone."], "quote": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "to\\ pikro\\n kai\\ kata/texnon"}, "#text": "The first of these three phases, the Aeschylean, is not traceable in the extant work of Sophocles.

Now, it is a peculiarity of the  that, beside two speeches which are normal examples of this class,the speech of Hyllus (vv. 749812), and that of the Nurse (vv. 899946),it contains a remarkable number of other passages which are closely akin to that class.

Altogether, about one fourth of the play consists of passages which invited or demanded this high elaboration of style, usually reserved for very exceptional moments. It is no accident that the element of narrative in the  is so abnormally large; the cause lies in the nature of the fable itself, and is independent of the circumstance that an epic poem, the , was probably one of the chief sources.

For, in the first place, Deianeira's speech is no soliloquy,though it is true that she is rather communing with her own thoughts than directly addressing the Nurse; it gives the cue for the Nurse's suggestion that Hyllus should be sent to seek his father, and thus serves to set the drama in motion. Secondly, it is dramatic as illustrating the mind of Deianeira herself,that mind which is to govern the subsequent action. Even with regard to this prologue, the inner contrast between the two poets is more significant than the resemblance. Nor can it be said that the general style of the play shows any pervading influence of the supposed kind. There are a few coincidences of phrase between verses of the  and verses of Euripides; but they are trivial; and,  even if it were certain that in all of them Sophocles was the debtor, they would merely illustrate a fact which is unquestioned.
