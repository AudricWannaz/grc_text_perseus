Adeimantus took me by the hand and said, Welcome, Cephalus if there is anything we can do for you here, let us know.Why, said I, that is just why I am here, to ask a favour of you.Tell us, said he, what it is.\nAnd I said, What was your half-brother's name?  I don't remember.  He was only a boy when I came here from Clazomenae before and that is now a long time ago.  His father's name, I believe, was Pyrilampes.Yes, said he.And what is his own name?Antiphon.   Why do you ask?These gentlemen, I said, are fellow-citizens of mine, who are very fond of philosophy.  They have heard that this Antiphon had a good deal to do with a friend of 's named Pythodorus, that Pythodorus often repeated to him the conversation\nwhich , , and Parmenides once had together, and that he remembers it.That is true, said he.Well, I said, we should like to hear it.There is no difficulty about that, said he for when he was a youth he studied it with great care though now he devotes most of his time to horses, like his grandfather Antiphon.  If that is what you want, let us go to him.  He has just gone home from here, and he lives close by in Melite.\nThereupon we started, and we found Antiphon at home, giving a smith an order to make a bridle. When he had got rid of the smith and his brother told him what we were there for, he remembered me from my former visit and greeted me cordially, and when we asked him to repeat the conversation, he was at first unwillingfor he said it was a good deal of troublebut afterwards he did so.  Antiphon, then, said that Pythodorus told him\nthat  and Parmenides once came to the Great Panathenaea; that Parmenides was already quite elderly, about sixty-five years old, very white-haired, and of handsome and noble countenance;  was at that time about forty years of age; he was tall and good-looking, and there was a story that Parmenides had been in love with him.\nHe said that they lodged with Pythodorus outside of the wall, in Cerameicus, and that  and many others with him went there because they wanted to hear 's writings, which had been brought to  for the first time by them.   was then very young.  So  himself read aloud to them, and Parmenides was not in the house.\nPythodorus said the reading of the treatises was nearly finished when he came in himself with Parmenides and Aristoteles (the one who was afterwards one of the thirty), so they heard only a little that remained of the written works.  He himself, however, had heard  read them before. listened to the end, and then asked that the first thesis of the first treatise be read again. When this had been done, he said:\n, what do you mean by this?  That if existences are many, they must be both like and unlike, which is impossible; for the unlike cannot be like, nor the like unlike? Is not that your meaning?Yes, said .Then if it is impossible for the unlike to be like and the like unlike, it is impossible for existences to be many; for if they were to be many, they would experience the impossible.  Is that the purpose of your treatises, to maintain against all arguments that existences are not many?  And you think each of your treatises is a proof of this very thing, and therefore you believe that the proofs you offer that existences are not many are as many as the treatises you have written?  Is that your meaning,\nor have I misunderstood?No, said , you have grasped perfectly the general intent of the work.I see, Parmenides, said , that  here wishes to be very close to you not only in his friendship, but also in his writing.  For he has written much the same thing as you, but by reversing the process he tries to cheat us into the belief that he is saying something new.  For you, in your poems, say that the all is one,\nand you furnish proofs of this in fine and excellent fashion; and he, on the other hand, says it is not many, and he also furnishes very numerous and weighty proofs.  That one of you says it is one, and the other that it is not many, and that each of you expresses himself so that although you say much the same you seem not to have said the same things at all, appears to the rest of us a feat of expression quite beyond our power.Yes, , said , but you have not perceived all aspects of the truth about my writings. You follow the arguments with a scent\nas keen as a Laconian hound's, but you do not observe that my treatise is not by any means so pretentious that it could have been written with the intention you ascribe to it, of disguising itself as a great performance in the eyes of men.  What you mentioned is a mere accident, but in truth these writings are meant to support the argument of Parmenides against those who attempt to jeer at him and assert that\nif the all is one many absurd results follow which contradict his theory.  Now this treatise opposes the advocates of the many and gives them back their ridicule with interest, for its purpose is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one.  It was in such a spirit of controversy that I wrote it when I was young,\nand when it was written some one stole it, so that I could not even consider whether it should be published or not. So, , you are not aware of this and you think that the cause of its composition was not the controversial spirit of a young man, but the ambition of an old one.  In other respects, as I said, you guessed its meaning pretty well.I see, said , and I accept your explanation.  But tell me, do you not believe there is an idea of likeness in the abstract,\nand another idea of unlikeness, the opposite of the first, and that you and I and all things which we call many partake of these two?  And that those which partake of likeness become like, and those which partake of unlikeness become unlike, and those which partake of both become both like and unlike, all in the manner and degree of their participation? And even if all things partake of both opposites, and are enabled by their participation to be both like and unlike themselves,\nwhat is there wonderful about that?  For if anyone showed that the absolute like becomes unlike, or the unlike like, that would, in my opinion, be a wonder; but if he shows that things which partake of both become both like and unlike, that seems to me, , not at all strange, not even if he shows that all things are one by participation in unity and that the same are also many by participation in multitude; but if he shows that absolute unity is also many and the absolute many again are one, then I shall be amazed.\nThe same applies to all other things.  If he shows that the kinds and ideas in and by themselves possess these opposite qualities, it is marvellous but if he shows that I am both one and many, what marvel is there in that?  He will say, when he wishes to show that I am many, that there are my right parts and my left parts, my front parts and my back parts, likewise upper and lower, all different; for I do, I suppose, partake of multitude;\nand when he wishes to show that I am one, he will say that we here are seven persons, of whom I am one, a man, partaking also of unity and so he shows that both assertions are true.  If anyone then undertakes to show that the same things are both many and oneI mean such things as stones, sticks, and the likewe shall say that he shows that they are many and one, but not that the one is many or the many one; he says nothing wonderful, but only what we should all accept.  If, however, as I was saying just now, he first distinguishes the abstract ideas, such as likeness and unlikeness,\nmultitude and unity, rest and motion, and the like, and then shows that they can be mingled and separated, I should, said he, be filled with amazement, .  Now I think this has been very manfully discussed by you; but I should, as I say, be more amazed if anyone could show in the abstract ideas, which are intellectual conceptions,\nthis same multifarious and perplexing entanglement which you described in visible objects.Pythodorus said that he thought at every word, while  was saying this, Parmenides and  would be angry, but they paid close attention to him and frequently looked at each other and smiled, as if in admiration of , and when he stopped speaking Parmenides expressed their approval.  ,\nhe said, what an admirable talent for argument you have!  Tell me, did you invent this distinction yourself, which separates abstract ideas from the things which partake of them?  And do you think there is such a thing as abstract likeness apart from the likeness which we possess, and abstract one and many, and the other abstractions of which you heard  speaking just now?Yes, I do, said .And also, said Parmenides, abstract ideas of the just, the beautiful, the good, and all such conceptions?Yes, he replied.\nAnd is there an abstract idea of man, apart from us and all others such as we are, or of fire or water?I have often, he replied, been very much troubled, Parmenides, to decide whether there are ideas of such things, or not.And are you undecided about certain other things, which you might think rather ridiculous, such as hair, mud, dirt, or anything else particularly vile and worthless?  Would you say that there is an idea of each of these distinct and different from the things\nwith which we have to do, or not?By no means, said .  No, I think these things are such as they appear to us, and it would be quite absurd to believe that there is an idea of them; and yet I am sometimes disturbed by the thought that perhaps what is true of one thing is true of all.  Then when I have taken up this position, I run away for fear of falling into some abyss of nonsense and perishing; so when I come to those things which we were just saying do have ideas, I stay and busy myself with them.\nYes, for you are still young, said Parmenides, and philosophy has not yet taken hold upon you, , as I think it will later.  Then you will not despise them; but now you still consider people's opinions, on account of your youth.  Well, tell me do you think that, as you say, there are ideas, and that these other things which partake of them are named from them,\nas, for instance, those that partake of likeness become like, those that partake of greatness great, those that partake of beauty and justice just and beautiful?Certainly, said .Well then, does each participant object partake of the whole idea, or of a part of it?  Or could there be some other third kind of participation?How could there be?  said he.Do you think the whole idea, being one, is in each of the many participants, or what?Yes, for what prevents it from being in them, Parmenides?  said .\nThen while it is one and the same, the whole of it would be in many separate individuals at once, and thus it would itself be separate from itself.No, he replied, for it might be like day, which is one and the same, is in many places at once, and yet is not separated from itself; so each idea, though one and the same, might be in all its participants at once.That, said he, is very neat,  you make one to be in many places at once, just as if you should spread a sail over many persons and then should say it was one and all of it was over many.\nIs not that about what you mean?Perhaps it is, said .Would the whole sail be over each person, or a particular part over each?A part over each.Then, said he, the ideas themselves, , are divisible into parts, and the objects which partake of them would partake of a part, and in each of them there would be not the whole, but only a part of each idea.So it appears.Are you, then, , willing to assert that the one idea is really divided and will still be one?By no means, he replied.No, said Parmenides, for if you divide absolute greatness,\nand each of the many great things is great by a part of greatness smaller than absolute greatness, is not that unreasonable?Certainly, he said.Or again, will anything by taking away a particular small part of equality possess something by means of which, when it is less than absolute equality, its possessor will be equal to anything else?That is impossible.Or let one of us have a part of the small; the small will be greater than this, since this is a part of it, and therefore the absolute small will be greater; but that to which the part of the small is added will be smaller,\nnot greater, than before.That, said he, is impossible.How, then, , will other things partake of those ideas of yours, if they cannot partake of them either as parts or as wholes?By Zeus, he replied, I think that is a very hard question to determine.Well, what do you think of this?Of what?\nI fancy your reason for believing that each idea is one is something like this; when there is a number of things which seem to you to be great, you may think, as you look at them all, that there is one and the same idea in them, and hence you think the great is one.That is true, he said.But if with your mind's eye you regard the absolute great and these many great things in the same way, will not another great appear beyond, by which all these must appear to be great?So it seems.That is, another idea of greatness will appear, in addition to absolute greatness and the objects which partake of it;\nand another again in addition to these, by reason of which they are all great; and each of your ideas will no longer be one, but their number will be infinite.But, Parmenides, said , each of these ideas may be only a thought, which can exist only in our minds then each might be one, without being exposed to the consequences you have just mentioned.But, he said, is each thought one, but a thought of nothing?That is impossible, he replied.But of something?Yes.\nOf something that is, or that is not?Of something that is.A thought of some single element which that thought thinks of as appertaining to all and as being one idea?Yes.Then will not this single element, which is thought of as one and as always the same in all, be an idea?That, again, seems inevitable.Well then, said Parmenides, does not the necessity which compels you to say that all other things partake of ideas, oblige you also to believe either that everything is made of thoughts, and all things think, or that, being thoughts, they are without thought?That is quite unreasonable, too, he said,\nbut Parmenides, I think the most likely view is, that these ideas exist in nature as patterns, and the other things resemble them and are imitations of them; their participation in ideas is assimilation to them, that and nothing else.Then if anything, he said, resembles the idea, can that idea avoid being like the thing which resembles it, in so far as the thing has been made to resemble it; or is there any possibility that the like be unlike its like?No, there is none.And must not necessarily the like partake of\nthe same idea as its like?It must.That by participation in which like things are made like, will be the absolute idea, will it not?Certainly.Then it is impossible that anything be like the idea, or the idea like anything; for if they are alike, some further idea, in addition to the first, will always appear, and if that is like anything, still another,\nand a new idea will always be arising, if the idea is like that which partakes of it.Very true.Then it is not by likeness that other things partake of ideas we must seek some other method of participation.So it seems.Do you see, then, , how great the difficulty is, if we maintain that ideas are separate, independent entities?Yes, certainly.You may be sure, he said, that you do not yet, if I may say so,\ngrasp the greatness of the difficulty involved in your assumption that each idea is one and is something distinct from concrete things.How is that?  said he.There are many reasons, he said, but the greatest is this; if anyone should say that the ideas cannot even be known if they are such as we say they must be, no one could prove to him that he was wrong, unless he who argued that they could be known were a man of wide education and ability and were willing to follow the proof through many long and elaborate details;\nhe who maintains that they cannot be known would be unconvinced.Why is that, Parmenides?  said .Because, , I think that you or anyone else who claims that there is an absolute idea of each thing would agree in the first place that none of them exists in us.No, for if it did, it would no longer be absolute, said .You are right, he said.  Then those absolute ideas which are relative to one another have their own nature in relation to themselves, and not in relation to the likenesses,\nor whatever we choose to call them, which are amongst us, and from which we receive certain names as we participate in them. And these concrete things, which have the same names with the ideas, are likewise relative only to themselves, not to the ideas, and, belong to themselves, not to the like-named ideas.What do you mean?  said .For instance, said Parmenides, if one of us is master or slave of anyone, he is not the slave of master in the abstract,\nnor is the master the master of slave in the abstract; each is a man and is master or slave of a man but mastership in the abstract is mastership of slavery in the abstract, and likewise slavery in the abstract is slavery to mastership in the abstract, but our slaves and masters are not relative to them, nor they to us;\nthey, as I say, belong to themselves and are relative to themselves and likewise our slaves and masters are relative to themselves.  You understand what I mean, do you not?Certainly, said , I understand.Then knowledge also, if abstract or absolute, would be knowledge of abstract or absolute truth?Certainly.And likewise each kind of absolute knowledge would be knowledge of each kind of absolute being, would it not?Yes.And would not the knowledge that exists among us be the knowledge of the truth that exists among us, and each kind of our knowledge\nbe the knowledge of each kind of truth that exists among us?Yes, that is inevitable.But the ideas themselves, as you, agree, we have not, neither can they be among us.No, they cannot.And the various classes of ideas are known by the absolute idea of knowledge?Yes.Which we do not possess.No, we do not.Then none of the ideas is known by us, since we do not partake of absolute knowledge.Apparently not.Then the absolute good and the beautiful and all\nwhich we conceive to be absolute ideas are unknown to us.I am afraid they are.Now we come to a still more fearful consequence.What is it?You would say, no doubt, that if there is an absolute kind of knowledge, it is far more accurate than our knowledge, and the same of beauty and all the rest?Yes.And if anything partakes of absolute knowledge, you would say that there is no one more likely than God to possess this most accurate knowledge?Of course.\nThen will it be possible for God to know human things, if he has absolute knowledge?Why not?Because, said Parmenides, we have agreed that those ideas are not relative to our world, nor our world to them, but each only to themselves.Yes, we have agreed to that.Then if this most perfect mastership and this most accurate knowledge are with God, his mastership can never rule us,\nnor his knowledge know us or anything of our world; we do not rule the gods with our authority, nor do we know anything of the divine with our knowledge, and by the same reasoning, they likewise, being gods, are not our masters and have no knowledge of human affairs.But surely this, said he, is a most amazing argument, if it makes us deprive God of knowledge.And yet, , said Parmenides,\nthese difficulties and many more besides are inseparable from the ideas, if these ideas of things exist and we declare that each of them is an absolute idea. Therefore he who hears such assertions is confused in his mind and argues that the ideas do not exist, and even if they do exist cannot by any possibility be known by man; and he thinks that what he says is reasonable, and, as I was saying just now, he is amazingly hard to convince.  Only a man of very great natural gifts will be able to understand that everything has a class and absolute essence,\nand only a still more wonderful man can find out all these facts and teach anyone else to analyze them properly and understand them.I agree with you, Parmenides, said , for what you say is very much to my mind.But on the other hand, said Parmenides, if anyone, with his mind fixed on all these objections and others like them, denies the existence of ideas of things, and does not assume an idea under which each individual thing is classed, he will be quite at a loss,\nsince he denies that the idea of each thing is always the same, and in this way he will utterly destroy the power of carrying on discussion. You seem to have been well aware of this.Quite true, he said.Then what will become of philosophy?  To what can you turn, if these things are unknown?I do not see at all, at least not at present.No, , he said, for you try too soon, before you are properly trained, to define the beautiful, the just, the good, and all the other ideas.\nYou see I noticed it when I heard you talking yesterday with Aristoteles here.  Your impulse towards dialectic is noble and divine, you may be assured of that; but exercise and train yourself while you are still young in an art which seems to be useless and is called by most people mere loquacity; otherwise the truth will escape you.What, then, Parmenides, he said, is the method of training?That which you heard  practising, said he.\nHowever, even when you were speaking to him I was pleased with you, because you would not discuss the doubtful question in terms of visible objects or in relation to them, but only with reference to what we conceive most entirely by the intellect and may call ideas.Yes, he said, that is because I think that in that way it is quite easy to show that things experience likeness or unlikeness or anything else.Quite right, said he, but if you wish to get better training, you must do something more than that;\nyou must consider not only what happens if a particular hypothesis is true, but also what happens if it is not true.What do you mean? he said.Take, for instance, he replied, that hypothesis of 's if the many exist, you should inquire what will happen to the many themselves in relation to themselves and to the one, and to the one in relation to itself and to the many, and also what will happen to the one and the many in relation to themselves and to each other, if the many do not exist.\nAnd likewise if you suppose the existence or non-existence of likeness, what will happen to the things supposed and to other things in relation to themselves and to each other under each of the two hypotheses.  The same applies to unlikeness and to motion and rest, creation and destruction, and even to being and not being.  In brief, whatever the subject of your hypothesis, if you suppose that it is or is not, or that it experiences any other affection, you must consider what happens to it and to any other particular things you may choose, and to a greater number and to all in the same way;\nand you must consider other things in relation to themselves and to anything else you may choose in any instance, whether you suppose that the subject of your hypothesis exists or does not exist, if you are to train yourself completely to see the truth perfectly.Parmenides, he said, it is a stupendous amount of study which you propose, and I do not understand very well.  Why do you not yourself frame an hypothesis and discuss it, to make me understand better?\nThat is a great task, , he said, to impose upon a man of my age.But you, , said , why do not you do it for us?Pythodorus said that  answered with a smile:  Let us ask it of Parmenides himself, ; for there is a great deal in what he says, and perhaps you do not see how heavy a task you are imposing upon him.  If there were more of us, it would not be fair to ask it of him; for it is not suitable for him to speak on such subjects before many, especially at his age;\nfor the many do not know that except by this devious passage through all things the mind cannot attain to the truth.  So I, Parmenides, join  in his request, that I myself may hear the method, which I have not heard for a long time.Antiphon said that Pythodorus told him that when  said this he himself and Antisthenes and the rest begged Parmenides to show his meaning by an example and not to refuse.  And Parmenides said:  I must perforce do as you ask.\nAnd yet I feel very much like the horse in the poem of Ibycusan old race-horse who was entered for a chariot race and was trembling with fear of what was before him, because he knew it by experience.  Ibycus says he is compelled to fall in love against his will in his old age, and compares himself to the horse. So I am filled with terror when I remember through what a fearful ocean of words I must swim, old man that I am.  However, I will do it, for I must be obliging, especially since we are, as  says, alone.\nWell, how shall we begin?  What shall be our first hypothesis?  Or, since you are determined that I must engage in a laborious pastime, shall I begin with myself, taking my own hypothesis and discussing the consequences of the supposition that the one exists or that it does not exist?By all means, said .Who then, said he, to answer my questions?  Shall we say the youngest?  He would be least likely to be over-curious and most likely to say what he thinks and moreover his replies would give me a chance to rest.\nI am ready, Parmenides, to do that, said Aristoteles, for I am the youngest, so you mean me.  Ask your questions and I will answer.Well then, said he, if the one exists, the one cannot be many, can it?  No, of course not.  Then there can be no parts of it, nor can it be a whole.  How is that?  The part surely is part of a whole.  Yes.  And what is the whole?  Is not a whole that of which no part is wanting?\nCertainly.  Then in both cases the one would consist of parts, being a whole and having parts.  Inevitably.  Then in both cases the one would be many, not one.  True.  Yet it must be not many, but one.  Yes.  Then the one, if it is to be one, will not be a whole and will not have parts.  No.And if it has no parts, it can have no beginning, or middle, or end, for those would be parts of it?  Quite right.  Beginning and end are, however, the limits of everything.  Of course.  Then the one, if it has neither beginning nor end, is unlimited.  Yes, it is unlimited.  And it is without form,\nfor it partakes neither of the round nor of the straight.  How so?  The round, of course, is that of which the extremes are everywhere equally distant from the center.  Yes.  And the straight, again, is that of which the middle is in the nearest line between the two extremes.  It is.  Then the one would have parts and would be many, whether it partook of straight or of round form.  Certainly.  Then it is neither straight nor round, since it has no parts.\nRight.Moreover, being of such a nature, it cannot be anywhere, for it could not be either in anything else or in itself.  How is that?  If it were in something else, it would be encircled by that in which it would be and would be touched in many places by many parts of it; but that which is one and without parts and does not partake of the circular nature cannot be touched by a circle in many places.  No, it cannot.  But, furthermore, being in itself it would also be surrounding with itself naught other than itself,\nif it were in itself; for nothing can be in anything which does not surround it.  No, it cannot.  Then that which surrounds would be other than that which is surrounded; for a whole cannot be both active and passive in the same action; and thus one would be no longer one, but two.  True.  Then the one is not anywhere, neither in itself nor in something else.  No, it is not.This being the case, see whether it can be either at rest or in motion.  Why not?\nBecause if in motion it would be either moving in place or changing; for those are the only kinds of motion.  Yes.  But the one, if changing to something other than itself, cannot any longer be one.  It cannot.  Then it is not in motion by the method of change.  Apparently not.  But by moving in place?  Perhaps.  But if the one moved in place, it would either revolve in the same spot or pass from one place to another.  Yes, it must do so.  And that which revolves must rest upon a center and have other parts which turn about the center;\nbut what possible way is there for that which has no center and no parts to revolve upon a center?  There is none.  But does it change its place by coming into one place at one time and another at another, and move in that way?  Yes, if it moves at all.  Did we not find that it could not be in anything?  Yes.  And is it not still more impossible for it to come into anything?  I do not understand why.  If anything comes into anything, it must be not yet in it, while it is still coming in, nor still entirely outside of it, if it is already coming in, must it not?  It must.\nNow if anything goes through this process, it can be only that which has parts; for a part of it could be already in the other, and the rest outside; but that which has no parts cannot by any possibility be entirely neither inside nor outside of anything at the same time.  True.  But is it not still more impossible for that which has no parts and is not a whole to come into anything, since it comes in neither in parts nor as a whole?  Clearly.\nThen it does not change its place by going anywhere or into anything, nor does it revolve in a circle, nor change.  Apparently not.  Then the one is without any kind of motion.  It is motionless.  Furthermore, we say that it cannot be in anything.  We do.  Then it is never in the same.  Why is that?  Because it would then be in that with which the same is identical.  Certainly.  But we saw that it cannot be either in itself or in anything else.  No, it cannot.  Then the one is never in the same.\nApparently not.  But that which is never in the same is neither motionless nor at rest.  No, it cannot be so.  The one, then, it appears, is neither in motion nor at rest.  No, apparently not.Neither, surely, can it be the same with another or with itself; nor again other than itself or another.  Why not?  If it were other than itself, it would be other than one and would not be one.  True.  And, surely, if it were the same with another, it would be that other, and would not be itself;\ntherefore in this case also it would not be that which it is, namely one, but other than one.  Quite so.  Then it will not be the same as another, nor other than itself.  No.  But it will not be other than another, so long as it is one.  For one cannot be other than anything; only other, and nothing else, can be other than another.  Right.  Then it will not be other by reason of being one, will it?  Certainly not.  And if not for this reason, not by reason of itself; and if not by reason of itself, not itself; but since itself is not other at all,\nit will not be other than anything.  Right.  And yet one will not be the same with itself.  Why not?  The nature of one is surely not the same as that of the same.  Why?  Because when a thing becomes the same as anything, it does not thereby become one.  But why not?  That which becomes the same as many, becomes necessarily many, not one.  True.  But if the one and the same were identical, whenever anything became the same it would always become one, and when it became one, the same.  Certainly.  Then if the one is the same with itself,\nit will not be one with itself; and thus, being one, it will not be one; this, however, is impossible; it is therefore impossible for one to be either the other of other or the same with itself.  Impossible.  Thus the one cannot be either other or the same to itself or another.  No, it cannot.  And again it will not be like or unlike anything, either itself or another.  Why not?  Because the like is that which is affected in the same way.  Yes.  But we saw that the same was of a nature distinct from that of the one.  Yes, so we did.\nBut if the one were affected in any way apart from being one, it would be so affected as to be more than one, and that is impossible.  Yes.  Then the one cannot possibly be affected in the same way as another or as itself.  Evidently not.  Then it cannot be like another or itself.  No, so it appears.  Nor can the one be so affected as to be other; for in that case it would be so affected as to be more than one.  Yes, it would be more.  But that which is affected in a way other than itself or other,\nwould be unlike itself or other, if that which is affected in the same way is like.  Right.  But the one, as it appears, being never affected in a way other than itself or other, is never unlike either itself or other.  Evidently not.  Then the one will be neither like nor unlike either other or itself.  So it seems.Since, then, it is of such a nature, it can be neither equal nor unequal to itself or other.  Why not?  If it is equal, it is of the same measures as that to which it is equal.  Yes.  And if it is greater or less than things\nwith which it is commensurate, it will have more measures than the things which are less and less measures than the things which are greater.  Yes.  And in the case of things with which it is not commensurate, it will have smaller measures than some and greater measures than others.  Of course.  Is it not impossible for that which does not participate in sameness to have either the same measures or anything else the same?  Impossible.  Then not having the same measures, it cannot be equal either to itself or to anything else.  No, apparently not.  But whether it have more measures or less,\nit will have as many parts as measures and thus one will be no longer one, but will be as many as are its measures.  Right.  But if it were of one measure, it would be equal to the measure; but we have seen that it cannot be equal to anything.  Yes, so we have.  Then it will partake neither of one measure, nor of many, nor of few; nor will it partake at all of the same, nor will it ever, apparently, be equal to itself or to anything else; nor will it be greater or less than itself or another.  Perfectly true.\nWell, does anyone believe that the one can be older or younger or of the same age?  Why not?  Because if it has the same age as itself or as anything else, it will partake of equality and likeness of time, and we said the one had no part in likeness or equality.  Yes, we said that.  And we said also that it does not partake of unlikeness or inequality.  Certainly.  How, then, being of such a nature,\ncan it be either younger or older or of the same age as anything?  In no way.  Then the one cannot be younger or older or of the same age as anything.  No, evidently not.  And can the one exist in time at all, if it is of such a nature?  Must it not, if it exists in time, always be growing older than itself?  It must.  And the older is always older than something younger?  Certainly.  Then that which grows older than itself grows at the same time younger than itself, if it is to have something than which it grows older.  What do you mean?\nThis is what I mean: A thing which is different from another does not have to become different from that which is already different, but it must be different from that which is already different, it must have become different from that which has become so, it will have to be different from that which will be so, but from that which is becoming different it cannot have become, nor can it be going to be, nor can it already be different: it must become different, and that is all.  There is no denying that.\nBut surely the notion 'older' is a difference with respect to the younger and to nothing else.  Yes, so it is.  But that which is becoming older than itself must at the same time be becoming younger than itself.  So it appears.  But surely it cannot become either for a longer or for a shorter time than itself; it must become and be and be about to be for an equal time with itself.  That also is inevitable.  Apparently, then, it is inevitable that everything which exists in time and partakes of time\nis of the same age as itself and is also at the same time becoming older and younger than itself.  I see no escape from that.  But the one had nothing to do with such affections.  No, it had not.  It has nothing to do with time, and does not exist in time.  No, that is the result of the argument.Well, and do not the words 'was,' 'has become,' and 'was becoming' appear to denote participation in past time?  Certainly.\nAnd 'will be,' 'will become,' and 'will be made to become,' in future time?  Yes.  And 'is' and 'is becoming' in the present?  Certainly.  Then if the one has no participation in time whatsoever, it neither has become nor became nor was in the past, it has neither become nor is it becoming nor is it in the present, and it will neither become nor be made to become nor will it be in the future.  Very true.  Can it then partake of being in any other way than in the past, present, or future?  It cannot.  Then the one has no share in being at all.  Apparently not.  Then the one is not at all.   Evidently not.   Then it has no being even so as to be one, for if it were one, it would be and would partake of being; but apparently one neither is nor is one, if this argument is to be trusted.\nThat seems to be true.  But can that which does not exist have anything pertaining or belonging to it?  Of course not.  Then the one has no name, nor is there any description or knowledge or perception or opinion of it.  Evidently not.  And it is neither named nor described nor thought of nor known, nor does any existing thing perceive it.  Apparently not.  Is it possible that all this is true about the one ?  I do not think so.Shall we then return to our hypothesis and see\nif a review of our argument discloses any new point of view?  By all means.  We say, then, that if the one exists, we must come to an agreement about the consequences, whatever they may be, do we not?  Yes.  Now consider the first point.  If one is, can it be and not partake of being?  No, it cannot.  Then the being of one will exist, but will not be identical with one; for if it were identical with one, it would not be the being of one, nor would one partake of it,\nbut the statement that one is would be equivalent to the statement that one is one but our hypothesis is not if one is one, what will follow, but if one is.  Do you agree?  Certainly.  In the belief that one and being differ in meaning?  Most assuredly.  Then if we say concisely 'one is,' it is equivalent to saying that one partakes of being?  Certainly.  Let us again say what will follow if one is and consider whether this hypothesis must not necessarily show that one is of such a nature as to have parts.  How does that come about ?  In this way:\nIf being is predicated of the one which exists and unity is predicated of being which is one, and being and the one are not the same, but belong to the existent one of our hypothesis, must not the existent one be a whole of which the one and being are parts?  Inevitably.  And shall we call each of these parts merely a part, or must it, in so far as it is a part, be called a part of the whole?  A part of the whole.  Whatever one, then, exists is a whole and has a part.  Certainly.  Well then, can either of these two parts of existent oneunity and beingabandon the other?\nCan unity cease to be a part of being or being to be a part of unity?  No.  And again each of the parts possesses unity and being, and the smallest of parts is composed of these two parts, and thus by the same argument any part whatsoever has always these two parts; for always unity has being and being has unity;\nand, therefore, since it is always becoming two, it can never be one.  Certainly.  Then it results that the existent one would be infinite in number?  Apparently.Let us make another fresh start.  In what direction?  We say that the one partakes of being, because it is?  Yes.  And for that reason the one, because it is, was found to be many.  Yes.  Well then, will the one, which we say partakes of being, if we form a mental conception of it alone by itself, without that of which we say it partakes, be found to be only one, or many?  One, I should say.\nJust let us see; must not the being of one be one thing and one itself another, if the one is not being, but, considered as one, partakes of being?  Yes, that must be so.  Then if being is one thing and one is another, one is not other than being because it is one, nor is being other than one because it is being, but they differ from each other by virtue of being other and different.  Certainly.  Therefore the other is neither the same as one nor as being.  Certainly not.  Well, then, if we make a selection among them,\nwhether we select being and the other, or being and one, or one and the other, in each instance we select two things which may properly be called both?  What do you mean?  I will explain. We can speak of being?  Yes.  And we can also speak of one?  Yes, that too.  Then have we not spoken of each of them?  Yes.  And when I speak of being and one, do I not speak of both?  Certainly.  And also when I speak of being and other, or other and one, in every case I speak of each pair as both?\nYes.  If things are correctly called both, can they be both without being two?  They cannot.  And if things are two, must not each of them be one?  Certainly.  Then since the units of these pairs are together two, each must be individually one.  That is clear.  But if each of them is one, by the addition of any sort of one to any pair whatsoever the total becomes three?  Yes.  And three is an odd number, and two is even?  Of course.\nWell, when there are two units, must there not also be twice, and when there are three, thrice, that is, if two is twice one and three is thrice one?  There must.  But if there are two and twice, must there not also be twice two?  And again, if there are three and thrice, must there not be thrice three?  Of course.  Well then, if there are three and twice and two and thrice, must there not also be twice three and thrice two?  Inevitably.  Then there would be even times even,\nodd times odd, odd times even, and even times odd.  Yes.  Then if that is true, do you believe any number is left out, which does not necessarily exist?  By no means.  Then if one exists, number must also exist.  It must.  But if number exists, there must be many, indeed an infinite multitude, of existences; or is not number infinite in multitude and participant of existence?  Certainly it is.  Then if all number partakes of existence, every part of number will partake of it?  Yes.\nExistence, then, is distributed over all things, which are many, and is not wanting in any existing thing from the greatest to the smallest?  Indeed, is it not absurd even to ask that question?  For how can existence be wanting in any existing thing?  It cannot by any means.  Then it is split up into the smallest and greatest and all kinds of existences nothing else is so much divided,\nand in short the parts of existence are infinite.  That is true.  Its parts are the most numerous of all.  Yes, they are the most numerous.  Well, is there any one of them which is a part of existence, but is no part?  How could that be?  But if there is, it must, I imagine, so long as it is, be some one thing; it cannot be nothing.  That is inevitable.  Then unity is an attribute of every part of existence and is not wanting to a smaller or larger or any other part.  True.\nCan the one be in many places at once and still be a whole?  Consider that question.  I am considering and I see that it is impossible.  Then it is divided into parts, if it is not a whole; for it cannot be attached to all the parts of existence at once unless it is divided.  I agree.  And that which is divided into parts must certainly be as numerous as its parts.  It must.  Then what we said just nowthat existence was divided into the greatest number of partswas not true for it is not divided, you see, into any more parts than one,\nbut, as it seems, into the same number as one for existence is not wanting to the one, nor the one to existence, but being two they are equal throughout.  That is perfectly clear.  The one, then, split up by existence, is many and infinite in number.  Clearly.  Then not only the existent one is many, but the absolute one divided by existence, must be many.  Certainly.And because the parts are parts of a whole, the one would be limited by the whole;\nor are not the parts included by the whole?  They must be so.  But surely that which includes is a limit.  Of course.  Then the existent one is, apparently, both one and many, a whole and parts, limited and of infinite number.  So it appears.  Then if limited it has also extremes ?  Certainly.  Yes, and if it is a whole, will it not have a beginning, a middle, and an end?  Or can there be any whole without these three?  And if any one of these is wanting, will it still be a whole?  It will not.\nThen the one, it appears, will have a beginning, a middle, and an end.  It will.  But surely the middle is equally distant from the extremes for otherwise it would not be a middle.  No.  And the one, apparently, being of such a nature, will partake of some shape, whether straight or round or a mixture of the two.  Yes, it will.This being the case, will not the one be in itself and in other?  How is that?  Each of the parts doubtless is in the whole and none is outside of the whole.  True.  And all the parts are included in the whole ?\nYes.  And surely the one is all its parts, neither more nor less than all.  Certainly.  But the whole is the one, is it not?  Of course.  Then if all the parts are in the whole and all the parts are the one and the one is also the whole, and all the parts are included in the whole, the one will be included in the one, and thus the one will be in itself.  Evidently.  But the whole is not in the parts, neither in all of them nor in any.\nFor if it is in all, it must be in one, for if it were wanting in any one it could no longer be in all; for if this one is one of all, and the whole is not in this one, how can it still be in all?  It cannot in any way.  Nor can it be in some of the parts;  for if the whole were in some parts, the greater would be in the less, which is impossible.  Yes, it is impossible.  But not being in one or several or all of the parts, it must be in something else or cease to be anywhere at all?  It must.  And if it were nowhere, it would be nothing, but being a whole, since it is not in itself, it must be in something else, must it not?\nCertainly.  Then the one, inasmuch as it is a whole, is in other and inasmuch as it is all its parts, it is in itself;  and thus one must be both in itself and in other.  It must.  This being its nature, must not the one be both in motion and at rest?  How is that?  It is at rest, no doubt, if it is in itself;  for being in one,\nand not passing out from this, it is in the same, namely in itself.  It is.  But that which is always in the same, must always be at rest.  Certainly.  Well, then, must not, on the contrary, that which is always in other be never in the same, and being never in the same be not at rest, and being not at rest be in motion?  True.  Then the one, being always in itself and in other, must always be in motion and at rest.  That is clear.And again, it must be the same with itself and other than itself,\nand likewise the same with all other things and other than they, if what we have said is true.  How is that?  Everything stands to everything in one of the following relations:  it is either the same or other;  or if neither the same or other, its relation is that of a part to a whole or of a whole to a part.  Obviously.  Now is the one a part of itself?  By no means.  Then it cannot, by being a part in relation to itself, be a whole in relation to itself, as a part of itself.  No, that is impossible.  Nor can it be other than itself.\nCertainly not.  Then if it is neither other nor a part nor a whole in relation to itself, must it not therefore be the same with itself?  It must.  Well, must not that which is in another place than itselfthe self being in the same place with itselfbe other than itself, if it is to be in another place?  I think so.  Now we saw that this was the case with one, for it was in itself and in other at the same time.  Yes, we saw that it was so.  Then by this reasoning the one appears to be other than itself.\nSo it appears.   Well then, if a thing is other than something, will it not be other than that which is other than it?   Certainly.  Are not all things which are not one, other than one, and the one other than the not one?  Of course.  Then the one would be other than the others.  Yes, it is other.  Consider;  are not the absolute same and the absolute other opposites of one another?  Of course.  Then will the same ever be in the other, or the other in the same?  No.  Then if the other can never be in the same, there is no existing thing\nin which the other is during any time;  for if it were in anything during any time whatsoever, the other would be in the same, would it not?  Yes, it would.  But since the other is never in the same, it can never be in any existing thing.  True.  Then the other cannot be either in the not one or in the one.  No, it cannot.  Then not by reason of the other will the one be other than the not one or the not one other than the one.  No.  And surely they cannot by reason of themselves be other than one another, if they do not partake of the other.\nOf course not.  But if they are not other than one another either by reason of themselves or by reason of the other, will it not be quite impossible for them to be other than one another at all?  Quite impossible.  But neither can the not one partake of the one;  for in that case they would not be not one, but would be one.  True.  Nor can the not one be a number;  for in that case, too, since they would possess number, they would not be not one at all.  No, they would not.  Well, then, are the not one parts of the one?  Or would the not one in that case also partake of the one?  Yes, they would partake of it.\nIf, then, in every way the one is one and the not one are not one, the one cannot be a part of the not one, nor a whole of which the not one are parts, nor are the not one parts of the one, nor a whole of which the one is a part.  No.  But we said that things which are neither parts nor wholes of one another, nor other than one another, are the same as one another.  Yes, we did.  Shall we say, then, that since the relations of the one and the not one are such as we have described, the two are the same as one another?  Yes, let us say that.  The one, then, is, it appears, other than all other things and than itself, and is also the same as other things and as itself.\nThat appears to be the result of our argument.Is it, then, also like and unlike itself and others?  Perhaps.  At any rate, since it was found to be other than others, the others must also be other than it.  Of course.  Then it is other than the others just as the others are other than it, neither more nor less?  Certainly.  And if neither more nor less, then in like degree?  Yes.  In so far as it is so affected as to be other than the others and the others are affected in the same way in relation to the one, to that degree the one will be affected\nin the same way as the others and the others in the same way as the one.  What do you mean?  I will explain.  You give a particular name to a thing?  Yes.  Well, you can utter the same name once or more than once?  Yes.  And do you name that to which the name belongs when you utter it once, but not when you utter it many times?  Or must you always mean the same thing when you utter the same name, whether once or repeatedly?  The same thing, of course.  The word other is the name of something, is it not?  Certainly.\nThen when you utter it, whether once or many times, you apply it to nothing else, and you name nothing else, than that of which it is the name.  Assuredly.  Now when we say that the others are other than the one, and the one is other than the others, though we use the word other twice, we do not for all that apply it to anything else, but we always apply it to that nature of which it is the name.  Certainly.\nIn so far as the one is other than the others and the others are other than the one, the one and the others are not in different states, but in the same state;  but whatever is in the same state is like, is it not?  Yes.  Then in so far as the one is in the state of being other than the others, just so far everything is like all other things;  for everything is other than all other things.  So it appears.  But the like is opposed to the unlike.  Yes.  And the other to the same.  That is also true.  But this, too, was shown, that the one is the same as the others.\nYes, it was.  And being the same as the others is the opposite of being other than the others.  Certainly.  In so far as it was other it was shown to be like.  Yes.  Then in so far as it is the same it will be unlike, since it has a quality which is the opposite of the quality which makes it like, for the other made it like.  Yes.  Then the same will make it unlike;  otherwise the same will not be the opposite of the other.\nSo it appears.  Then the one will be both like and unlike the others, like in so far as it is other, unlike in so far as it is the same.  Yes, that sort of conclusion seems to be tenable.  But there is another besides.  What is it?  In so far as it is in the same state, the one is not in another state, and not being in another state it is not unlike, and not being unlike it is like but in so far as it is in another state, it is of another sort, and being of another sort it is unlike.  True.  Then the one, because it is the same as the others and because it is other than the others, for both these reasons or for either of them would be both like and unlike the others.\nCertainly.  And likewise, since it has been shown to be other than itself and the same as itself, the one will for both these reasons or for either of them be both like and unlike itself.  That is inevitable.  Now, then, consider the question whether the one touches or does not touch itself and other things.  I am considering.  The one was shown, I think, to be in the whole of itself.  Right.  And the one is also in other things?  Yes.  Then by reason of being in the others\nit would touch them, and by reason of being in itself it would be prevented from touching the others, but would touch itself, since it is in itself.  That is clear.  Thus the one would touch itself and the other things.  It would.  But how about this?  Must not everything which is to touch anything be next to that which it is to touch, and occupy that position which, being next to that of the other, touches it?  It must.  Then the one, if it is to touch itself, must lie next to itself and occupy the position next to that in which it is.  Yes, it must.\nThe one, then, might do this if it were two, and might be in two places at once; but so long as it is one, it will not?   No, it will not.  The one can no more touch itself than it can be two.  No.  Nor, again, will it touch the others.  Why not?  Because, as we agreed, that which is to touch anything must be outside of that which it is to touch, and next it, and there must be no third between them.  True.  Then there must be two, at least, if there is to be contact.  There must.  And if\nto the two a third be added in immediate succession, there will be three terms and two contacts.  Yes.  And thus whenever one is added, one contact also is added, and the number of contacts is always one less than the number of terms;  for every succeeding number of terms exceeds the number of all the contacts just as much as the first two terms exceeded the number of their contacts.\nFor after the first every additional term adds one to the number of contacts.  Right.  Then whatever the number of terms, the contacts are always one less.  True.  But if only one exists, and not two, there can be no contact.  Of course not.  We affirm that those things which are other than one are not one and do not partake of oneness, since they are other.  They do not.  Then there is no number in others, if one is not in them.  Of course not.  Then the others are neither one nor two,\nnor have they the name of any other number.  No.  The one is, then, only one, and there can be no two.  That is clear.  There is no contact if there are no two terms.  No, there is none.  Then the one does not touch the others, nor the others the one, since there is no contact.  No, certainly not.  Thus on all these grounds the one touches and does not touch itself and the others.  So it appears.And is the one both equal and unequal to itself and the others?  How is that?  If the one were greater or less than the others,\nor, again, the others greater or less than the one, is it not true that the one, considered merely as one, and the others, considered merely as others, would be neither greater nor less than one another, so far as their own natures are concerned; but if in addition to their own natures, they both possessed equality, they would be equal to one another or if the others possessed greatness and the one smallness, or vice versa, that class to which greatness was added would be greater, and that to which smallness was added would be smaller?  Certainly.  These two ideas, greatness and smallness, exist, do they not?  For if they did not exist, they could not be opposites of one another and could not come into being in things.  That is obvious.\nThen if smallness comes into being in the one, it would be either in a part or in the whole of it.  Necessarily.  What if it be in the whole of one?  Will it not either be on an equality with the one, extending throughout the whole of it, or else contain it?  Clearly.  And if smallness be on an equality with the one, will it not be equal to the one, and if it contain the one, greater than the one?  Of course.  But can smallness be equal to anything or greater than anything, performing the functions of greatness or equality and not its own functions?\nNo, it cannot.  Then smallness cannot exist in the whole of the one, but, if at all, only in a part of it.  Yes.  And neither can it exist in a whole part, for then it will behave just as it did in relation to the whole;  it will be equal to or greater than the part in which it happens to exist.  Inevitably.  Then smallness will never exist in anything, either in a part or in a whole, nor will anything be small except absolute smallness.  So it appears.  Nor will greatness exist in the one.\nFor in that case, something other than absolute greatness and differing from it, namely that in which greatness exists, would be greater, and that although there is no smallness in it, which greatness must exceed, if it be great.  But this is impossible, since smallness exists nowhere.  True.  But absolute greatness is not greater than anything but absolute smallness, and absolute smallness is not smaller than anything but absolute greatness.  No.  Then other things are neither greater nor smaller than the one, if they have neither greatness nor smallness,\nnor have even these two the power of exceeding or being exceeded in relation to the one, but only in relation to each other, nor can the one be greater or less than these two or than other things, since it has neither greatness nor smallness.  Evidently not.  Then if the one is neither greater nor smaller than the others, it can neither exceed them nor be exceeded by them?  Certainly not.  Then that which neither exceeds nor is exceeded must be on an equality, and being on an equality, must be equal.  Of course.\nAnd the one will be in the same relation to itself also;  if it have in itself neither greatness nor smallness, it cannot be exceeded by itself or exceed itself;  it would be on an equality with and equal to itself.  Certainly.  The one is, then, equal to itself and to the others.  Evidently.  But the one, being within itself, would also be contained by itself, and since it contains itself it would be greater than itself, and since it is contained by itself it would be less than itself;\nthus the one would be both greater and less than itself.  Yes, it would.  And is it true, moreover, that nothing can exist outside of the one and the others?  Of course.  But that which exists must always exist somewhere.  Yes.  And that which exists in anything will be smaller and will exist in the greater?  One thing cannot exist in another in any other way, can it?  No, it cannot.  But since there is nothing else apart from the one and the others, and they must be in something, must they not be in one another, the others in the one and the one in the others,\nor else be nowhere at all?  Clearly.  And because the one is in the others, the others will be greater than the one, since they contain it, and the one less than the others, since it is contained; but because the others are in the one, the one will by the same reasoning be greater than the others, and the others less than the one.  So it appears.  Then the one is equal to and greater and less than itself and the others.  Evidently.  And if equal and greater and less, it will be of equal and more and\nless measures with itself and the others, and since of equal, more, and less measures, of equal, more, and less parts.  Of course.  And being of equal and more and less measures, it will be less and more in number than itself and the others and likewise equal in number to itself and the others.  How is that?  If it is greater than any things, it will be of more measures than they;  and of as many parts as measures.  Similarly if it is less or equal, the number of parts will be less or equal.  True.  Then one, being greater and less than itself\nand equal to itself, will be of more and less measures than itself and of equal measures with itself, and if of measures, of parts also?  Of course.  And being of equal parts with itself, it will also be equal in number to itself, and if of more parts, more in number, and if of less parts, less in number than itself.  Clearly.  And will not the one possess the same relation towards other things?  Because it is shown to be greater than they, must it not also be more in number than they and because it is smaller, less in number?  And because it is equal in size, must it not be also, equal in number to the others?  Yes, it must.\nAnd so once more, as it appears, the one will be equal to, greater than, and less than itself and other things in number.  Yes, it will.And does the one partake of time and if it partakes of time, is it and does it become younger and older than itself and other things, and neither younger nor older than itself and the others?  What do you mean?  If one is, it is thereby shown to be.  Yes.  But is 'to be' anything else than participation in existence together with present time,\njust as 'was' denotes participation in existence together with past time, and 'will be' similar participation together with future time?  True.  Then the one partakes of time if it partakes of being.  Certainly.  And the time in which it partakes is always moving forward?  Yes.  Then it is always growing older than itself, if it moves forward with the time.  Certainly.  Now, do we not remember that there is something becoming younger when the older becomes older than it?  Yes, we do.  Then the one, since it becomes older than itself,\nwould become older than a self which becomes younger?  There is no doubt of it.  Thus the one becomes older and younger than itself.  Yes.  And it is older (is it not) when in becoming older it is in the present time, between the past and the future;  for in going from the past to the future it cannot avoid the present.  No, it cannot.  Then is it not the case that it ceases to become older\nwhen it arrives at the present, and no longer becomes, but actually is older?  For while it moves forward it can never be arrested by the present, since that which moves forward touches both the present and the future, letting the present go and seizing upon the future, proceeding or becoming between the two, the present and the future.  True.  But if everything that is becoming is unable to avoid and pass by the present, then when it reaches the present it always ceases to become\nand straightway is that which it happens to be becoming.  Clearly.  The one, then, when in becoming older it reaches the present, ceases to become and straightway is older.  Certainly.  It therefore is older than that than which it was becoming older; and it was becoming older than itself.  Yes.  And that which is older is older than that which is younger, is it not?  It is.  Then the one is younger than itself, when in becoming older it reaches the present.\nUndoubtedly.  But the present is inseparable from the one throughout its whole existence;  for it always is now whenever it is.  Of course.  Always, then, the one is and is becoming younger than itself.  So it appears.  And is it or does it become for a longer time than itself, or for an equal time?  For an equal time.  But that which is or becomes for an equal time is of the same age.  Of course.  But that which is of the same age is neither older nor younger.  No.  Then the one, since it is and becomes for an equal time with itself, neither is nor becomes older or younger than itself.  I agree.  Well, then, is it or does it become older or younger than other things?\nI cannot tell.  But you can at any rate tell that the others, if they are others, not an otherplural, not singularare more than one;  for if they were an other, they would be one;  but since they are others, they are more than one and have multitude.  Yes, they have.  And being a multitude, they would partake of a number greater than one.  Of course.  Well, which shall we say come and have come into being first, the greater or the smaller numbers?  The smaller.  Then the smallest comes into being first and that is the one, is it not?\nYes.  The one, therefore, has come into being first of all things that have number;  but all others also have number, if they are others and not an other.  They have.  And since it came into being first, it came into being, I suppose, before the others, and the others later;  but things which have come into being later are younger than that which came into being before them and thus the other things would be younger than the one, and the one older than the other things.  Yes, they would.Here is another question:  Can the one have come into being contrary to its own nature, or is that impossible?  It is impossible.\nBut surely the one was shown to have parts, a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Yes.  And the beginning of everythingof one and everything else alikecomes into being first, and after the beginning come all the other parts until the end arrives, do they not?  Certainly.  And we shall say also that all these others are parts of the whole and the one, and that it has become one and whole at the moment when the end arrives.  Yes, we shall say that.  The end, I imagine, comes into being last; and at that moment the one naturally comes into being;\nso that if the absolute one cannot come into being contrary to its own nature, since it has come into being simultaneously with the end, its nature must be such that it comes into being after all the others.  That is clear.  Then the one is younger than the others and the others are older than the one.  I think that is clear, too.  Well, must not a beginning or any other part whatsoever of one or of anything else whatsoever, if it be a part, not parts, be one, since it is a part?  It must.\nThen the one would come into being simultaneously with the first part and with the second, and it is not wanting in any part which comes into being in addition to any part whatsoever which may precede it, until it reaches the end and becomes complete one;  it will not be wanting in the middle, nor in the first, nor in the last, nor in any other part in the process of coming into being.  True.  Then one has the same age as all the others so that the absolute one, unless it is naturally contrary to nature, could not have come into being either before or after the others, but only simultaneously with them.\nAnd by this reasoning the one would be neither older nor younger than the others nor the others than the one, but of the same age;  but by the previous reasoning the one would be both older and younger than the others, and likewise the others than the one.  Certainly.  In this state, then, it is and in this way it has come into being.  But what about the one becoming older and younger than the others, and the others than the one, and becoming neither older nor younger?  Is it the same with becoming as with being, or otherwise?\nI cannot say.  But I can say as much as this, that even if one thing be older than another, it cannot become older by any greater difference in age than that which existed at first, nor if younger can it become younger by any greater difference;  for the addition of equals to unequals, whether in time or anything else whatsoever, makes the difference always equal to that which existed at first.  Yes, of course.  Then that which exists\ncan never become older or younger than that which exists, if the difference in age is always the same;  but it is and has become older, and the other is and has become younger, but it does not become so.  True.  And the one, since it exists, never becomes either older or younger than the other things.  No, it does not.  But see whether they become older and younger in this way.  In what way?  Because the one was found to be older than the others, and the others than the one.  What then?  When the one is older than the others,\nit has come into being a longer time than the others.  Yes.  Then consider again.  If we add an equal to a greater and to a less time, will the greater differ from the less by the same or by a smaller fraction?  By a smaller fraction.  Then the proportional difference in age which existed originally between the one and the others will not continue afterwards, but if an equal time be added to the one and the others, the difference in their ages will constantly diminish, will it not?\nYes.  And that which differs less in age from something than before becomes younger than before in relation to those things than which it formerly was older?  Yes, it becomes younger.  But if the one becomes younger, must not those other things in turn become older than formerly in relation to the one?  Certainly.  Then that which came into being later, becomes older in relation to the older, which came into being earlier;  yet it never is older, but is always becoming older; for the latter always tends towards being younger,\nand the former towards being older.  And conversely the older becomes in the same way younger than the younger.  For as they are moving in opposite directions, they are becoming the opposites of one another, the younger older than the older, and the older younger than the younger;  but they cannot finish the process of becoming;  for if they finished the process of becoming, they would no longer be becoming, they would be.  But as the case is, they become older and younger than one anotherthe one becomes younger than the others, because, as we saw, it is older and came into being earlier,\nand the others are becoming older than the one, because they came into being later. By the same reasoning the others stand in the same relation to the one, since they were seen to be older than the one and to have come into being earlier.  Yes, that is clear.  Then from the point of view that no one thing becomes older or younger than another, inasmuch as they always differ by an equal number, the one cannot become older or younger than the others, nor the others than the one;  but in so far as that which comes into being earlier must always differ by a different proportional part from that which comes into being later,\nand vice versafrom this point of view the one and the others must necessarily become both older and younger than one another, must they not?  Certainly.  For all these reasons, then, the one both is and becomes both older and younger than both itself and the others, and neither is nor becomes either older or younger than either itself or the others.  Perfectly true.  But since the one partakes of time and can become older and younger,\nmust it not also partake of the past, the future, and the present?  It must.  Then the one was and is and will be and was becoming and is becoming and will become.  Certainly.  And there would be and was and is and will be something which is in relation to it and belongs to it?  Certainly.  And there would be knowledge and opinion and perception of it;  there must be, if we are now carrying on all this discussion about it.  You are right.  And it has a name and definition, is named and defined,\nand all the similar attributes which pertain to other things pertain also to the one.  That is perfectly true.Let us discuss the matter once more and for the third time.  If the one is such as we have described it, being both one and many and neither one nor many, and partakes of time, must it not, because one is, sometimes partake of being, and again because one is not, sometimes not partake of being?  Yes, it must.  And can one, when it partakes of being, not partake of it, or partake of it when it does not partake of it?  No, it cannot.  Then it partakes at one time and does not partake at another;  for that is the only way in which it can partake and not partake of the same thing.\nTrue.  And is there not also a time when it assumes being and when it gives it up?  How can it sometimes have and sometimes not have the same thing, unless it receives it at some time and again loses it?  There is no other way at all.  But would you not say that receiving existence is generation or becoming?  Yes.  And losing existence is destruction?  Certainly.  The one, then, as it appears, since it receives and loses existence, is generated and destroyed.\nInevitably.  And being one and many and being generated and destroyed, when it becomes one its existence as many is destroyed, and when it becomes many its existence as one is destroyed, is it not?  Certainly.  And in becoming one and many, must it not be separated and combined?  Inevitably.  And when it becomes like and unlike, it must be assimilated and dissimilated?  Yes.  And when it becomes greater and smaller and equal, it must be increased and diminished and equalized?\nYes.  And when being in motion it comes to rest, and when being at rest it changes to motion, it must itself be in no time at all.  How is that?  It is impossible for it to be previously at rest and afterwards in motion, or previously in motion and afterwards at rest, without changing.  Of course.  And there is no time in which anything can be at once neither in motion nor at rest.  No, there is none.  And certainly it cannot change without changing.  I should say not.  Then when does it change?  For it does not change when it is at rest or when it is in motion or when it is in time.\nNo, it does not.  Does this strange thing, then, exist, in which it would be at the moment when it changes?  What sort of thing is that?  The instant.  For the instant seems to indicate a something from which there is a change in one direction or the other.  For it does not change from rest while it is still at rest, nor from motion while it is still moving;  but there is this strange instantaneous nature, something interposed between\nmotion and rest, not existing in any time, and into this and out from this that which is in motion changes into rest and that which is at rest changes into motion.  Yes, that must be so.  Then the one, if it is at rest and in motion, must change in each direction;  for that is the only way in which it can do both. But in changing, it changes instantaneously, and when it changes it can be in no time, and at that instant it will be neither in motion nor at rest.  No.  And will the case not be the same in relation to other changes?  When it changes from being to destruction\nor from not being to becoming, does it not pass into an intermediate stage between certain forms of motion and rest, so that it neither is nor is not, neither comes into being nor is destroyed?  Yes, so it appears.  And on the same principle, when it passes from one to many or from many to one, it is neither one nor many, is neither in a process of separation nor in one of combination.  And in passing from like to unlike or from unlike to like, it is neither like nor unlike, neither in a process of assimilation nor in one of dissimilation;\nand in passing from small to great and to equal and vice versa, it is neither small nor great nor equal, neither in a process of increase, nor of diminution, nor of equality.  Apparently not.  All this, then, would happen to the one, if the one exists.  Yes, certainly.Must we not consider what is likely to happen to the other things, if the one exists?  We must.  Shall we tell, then, what must happen to the things other than one, if one exists?  Let us do so.  Well, since they are other than the one, the other things are not the one for if they were, they would not be other than the one.  True.\nAnd yet surely the others are not altogether deprived of the one, but they partake of it in a certain way.  In what way?  Because the others are other than the one by reason of having parts; for if they had no parts, they would be altogether one.  True.  But parts, we affirm, belong to that which is a whole.  Yes, we affirm that they do.  But the whole must be one composed of many and of this the parts are parts.  For each of the parts must be a part, not of many, but of a whole.  How is that?  If anything is a part of many, and is itself one of the many, it will be a part of itself,\nwhich is impossible, and of each one of the others, if it is a part of all.  For if it is not a part of some particular one, it will be a part of the rest, with the exception of that one, and thus it will not be a part of each one, and not being a part of each one, it will not be a part of any one of the many.  But that which belongs to none cannot belong, whether as a part or as anything else, to all those things to none of which it belongs.  That is clear.  Then the part is a part, not of the many nor of all, but of a single form and a single concept\nwhich we call a whole, a perfect unity created out of all this it is of which the part is a part.  Certainly.  If, then, the others have parts, they will partake of the whole and of the one.  True.  Then the things which are other than one must be a perfect whole which has parts.  Yes, they must.  And the same reasoning applies to each part for the part must partake of the one.  For if each of the parts is a part,\nthe word 'each' implies that it is one, separated from the rest, and existing by itself;  otherwise it will not be 'each.'  True.  But its participation in the one clearly implies that it is other than the one, for if not, it would not partake of the one, but would actually be one;  but really it is impossible for anything except one itself to be one.  Yes, it is impossible.  And both the whole and the part must necessarily participate in the one;  for the one will be a whole of which the parts are parts, and again each individual one which is a part of a whole will be a part of the whole.  Yes.\nAnd will not the things which participate in the one be other than the one while participating in it?  Of course.  But the things which are other than the one will be many;  for if they were neither one nor more than one, they would not be anything.  No.But since the things which participate in the one as a part and the one as a whole are more than one, must not those participants in the one be infinite in number?  How so?  Let us look at the question in this way.  Is it not true that at the moment when they begin to participate in the one they are not one and do not participate in one?\nClearly.  Then they are multitudes, in which the one is not, are they not?  Yes, they are multitudes.  Well, then, if we should subtract from them in thought the smallest possible quantity, must not that which is subtracted, if it has no participation in one, be also a multitude, and not one?  It must.  And always when we consider the nature of the class, which makes it other than one, whatever we see of it at any time will be unlimited in number, will it not?  Certainly.  And, further, when each part becomes a part,\nstraightway the parts are limited in relation to each other and to the whole, and the whole in relation to the parts.  Undoubtedly.  The result, then, to the things which are other than one, that from the one and the union of themselves with it there arises, as it appears, something different within themselves which gives them a limitation in relation to one another;  but their own nature, when they are left to themselves, gives them no limits.  So it appears.  Then the things which are other than one, both as wholes and as parts, are both unlimited and partake of limitation.  Certainly.\nAnd are they also both like and unlike one another and themselves?  How is that?  Inasmuch as they are all by their own nature unlimited, they are all in that respect affected in the same way.  Certainly.  And surely inasmuch as they all partake of limitation, they are all affected in the same way in that respect also.  Obviously.  And inasmuch as they are so affected as to be both limited and limitless, they are affected by affections which are the opposites of one another.\nYes.  But opposites are as unlike as possible.  To be sure.  Then with regard to either one of their two affections they are like themselves and each other, but with regard to both of them together they are utterly opposed and unlike.  Yes, that must be true.  Therefore the others are both like and unlike themselves and one another.  So they are.  And they are the same as one another and also other than one another, they are both in motion and at rest, and since we have proved these cases, we can easily show that the things\nwhich are other than one experience all the opposite affections.  You are right.Then what if we now drop these matters as evident and again consider whether, if one is, the things other than one are as we have said, and there is no alternative.  Certainly.  Let us then begin at the beginning and ask, if one is, what must happen to the things which are other than one.  By all means.  Must not the one be separate from the others, and the others from the one?  Why is that?  Because there is nothing else besides these,\nwhich is other than one and other than the others.  For when we have said 'one and the others' we have included all things.  Yes, all things.  Then there is nothing other than these, in which both the one and the others may be.  No.  Then the one and the others can never be in the same.  Apparently not.  Then they are separate?  Yes.  And surely we say that what is truly one has no parts.  How can it have parts?  Then the one cannot be in the others as a whole, nor can parts of it, if it is separate from the others and has no parts.  Of course not.\nThen the others cannot partake of the one in any way;  they can neither partake of any part of it nor of the whole.  No, apparently not.  The others are, then, not one in any sense, nor have they in themselves any unity.  No.  But neither are the others many; for if they were many, each of them would be one part of the whole;  but actually the things that are other than one are not many nor a whole nor parts, since they do not participate in the one in any way.  Right.  Neither are the others two or three, nor are two or three in them, if they are entirely deprived of unity.\nTrue.Nor are the others either themselves like and unlike the one, nor are likeness and unlikeness in them;  for if they were like and unlike or had likeness and unlikeness in them, the things which are other than the one would have in them two elements opposite to one another.  That is clear.  But it is impossible for that to partake of two things which does not even partake of one.  Impossible.  The others are, then, not like nor unlike nor both.\nFor if they were like or unlike, they would partake of one of the two elements, and if they were both, of the two opposites and that was shown to be impossible.  True.They are, then, neither the same nor other, nor in motion nor at rest, nor becoming nor being destroyed, nor greater nor less nor equal, and they experience no similar affections;  for if the others are subject to such affections, they will participate in one and two and three and odd and even,\nin which we saw that they cannot participate, if they are in every way utterly deprived of unity.  Very true.  Therefore if one exists, the one is all things and nothing at all in relation both to itself and to all others.  Perfectly true.Well, and ought we not next to consider what must happen if one does not exist?  Yes, we ought.  What, then, is the sense of this hypothesisif one does not exist?  Is it different in any way from thisif not one does not exist?  Certainly it is different.  Is it merely different,\nor are the two expressionsif not one does not exist and if one does not existcomplete opposites?  They are complete opposites.  Now if a person should say 'if greatness does not exist', 'if smallness does not exist,' or anything of that sort, would he not make it clear that in each case the thing he speaks of as not existing is different?  Certainly.  And in our case does he not make it clear that he means, when he says 'if one is not,' that the thing which is not is different from other things, and do we not know what he means?  Yes, we do know.  In the first place, then, he speaks of something which is known, and secondly of something different from other things, when he says 'one,' whether he adds to it that it is or that it is not;\nfor that which is said to be non-existent is known none the less, and is known to be different from other things, is it not?  Certainly.  Then we should begin at the beginning by asking:  if one is not, what must follow?  In the first place this must be true of the one, that there is knowledge of it, or else not even the meaning of the words 'if the one does not exist' would be known.  True.  And is it not also true that the others differ from the one, or it cannot be said to differ from the others?  Certainly.  Then a difference belongs to the one in addition to knowledge;  for when we say that the one differs from the others,\nwe speak of a difference in the one, not in the others.  That is clear.  And the non-existent one partakes of 'that' and 'some' and 'this' and 'relation to this' and 'these' and all notions of that sort;  for the one could not be spoken of, nor could the things which are other than one, nor could anything in relation to the one or belonging to it be or be spoken of, if the one did not partake of the notion some or of those other notions.  True.  It is impossible for the one to be, if it does not exist,\nbut nothing prevents its partaking of many things; indeed it must do so, if that one of which we are speaking, and not something else, is not.  But if neither the one, nor 'that,' is not, but we are speaking of something else, there is no use in saying anything at all;  but if non-existence is the property of that one, and not of something else, then the one must partake of 'that' and of many other attributes.  Yes, certainly.And it will possess unlikeness in relation to other things for the things which are other than one, being different, will be of a different kind.  Yes.  And are not things which are of a different kind also of another kind?  Of course.  And things which are of another kind are unlike, are they not?\nYes, they are unlike.  Then if they are unlike the one, the one is evidently unlike the things which are unlike it.  Evidently.  Then the one possesses unlikeness in relation to which the others are unlike.  So it appears.  But if it possesses unlikeness to the others, must it not possess likeness to itself?  How is that?  If the one possesses unlikeness to the one, our argument will not be concerned with that which is of the nature of the one, and our hypothesis will not relate to the one, but to something other than one.\nCertainly.  But that is inadmissible.  It certainly is.  Then the one must possess likeness to itself.  It must.And neither is the one equal to the others;  for if it were equal, then it would both be and be like them in respect to equality, both of which are impossible, if one does not exist.  Yes, they are impossible.  And since it is not equal to the others, they cannot be equal to it, can they?  Certainly not.  And things which are not equal are unequal, are they not?  Yes.  And things which are unequal are unequal to something which is unequal to them?  Of course.  Then the one partakes of inequality, in respect to which the others are unequal to it?\nYes, it does.  But greatness and smallness are constituents of inequality.  Yes.  Then the one, such as we are discussing, possesses greatness and smallness?  So it appears.  Now surely greatness and smallness always keep apart from one another.  Certainly.  Then there is always something between them.  There is.  Can you think of anything between them except equality?  No, only equality.  Then anything which has greatness and smallness has also equality, which is between the two.  That is clear.\nThen the non-existent one, it appears, partakes of equality and greatness and smallness.  So it appears.And it must also, in a way, partake of existence.  How is that?  It must be in such conditions as we have been saying;  for if it were not, we should not be speaking the truth in saying that the one is not. And if we speak the truth, it is clear that we say that which is.  Am I not right?  You are.  Then inasmuch as we assert that we are speaking the truth,\nwe necessarily assert that we say that which is.  Necessarily.  Then, as it appears, the non-existent one exists.  For if it is not non-existent, but gives up something of being to not-being, then it will be existent.  Certainly.  Then if it does not exist and is to continue to be non-existent, it must have the existence of not-being as a bond, just as being has the non-existence of not-being, in order to attain its perfect existence. For in this way the existence of the existent and the non-existence of the non-existent would be best assured, when the existent partakes of the existence of being existent and of the non-existence of not being non-existent,\nthus assuring its own perfect existence, and the non-existent partakes of the non-existence of not being existent and the existence of being non-existent, and thus the non-existent also secures its perfect non-existence.  Very true.  Then since the existent partakes of non-existence and the non-existent of existence, the one, since it does not exist, necessarily partakes of existence to attain non-existence.  Yes, necessarily.  Clearly, then, the one, if it does not exist, has existence.  Clearly.  And non-existence also, if it does not exist.  Of course.Well, can anything which is in a certain condition be not in that condition without changing from it?  No, it cannot.  Then everything of that sortif a thing is and is not in a given conditionsignifies a change.\nOf course.  But change is motion; we agree to that?  It is motion.  And did we not see that the one is and is not?  Yes.  Then we see that it both is and is not in a given condition.  So it appears.  And we have seen that the non-existent one has motion, since it changes from being to not-being.  There is not much doubt of that.  But if it is nowhere among existing thingsand it is nowhere, if it does not existit cannot move from any place to another.  Of course not.  Then its motion cannot be change of place.  No, it cannot.\nNor surely can it turn in the same spot, for it nowhere touches the same for the same is existent, and the non-existent cannot be in any existent thing.  No, it is impossible.  Then the one, being non-existent, cannot turn in that in which it is not.  No.  And the one, whether existent or non-existent,  cannot change into something other than itself; for if it changed into something other than itself, our talk would no longer be about the one, but about something else.  Quite right.  But if it neither changes into something else,\nnor turns in the same spot, nor changes its place, can it still move in any way?  No how can it?  But surely that which is without motion must keep still, and that which keeps still must be at rest.  Yes, it must.  Then the non-existent one is both at rest and in motion.  So it appears.  And if it is in motion, it certainly must change in its nature;\nfor if anything is moved in any way, in so far as it is moved it is no longer in its former condition, but in a different one. True.  Then in moving, the one changes in nature.  Yes.  And yet when it does not move in any way, it will not change its nature in any way.  No.  Then in so far as the non-existent one moves, it changes, and in so far as it does not move, it does not change.  True.  Then the non-existent one both changes and does not change.  So it appears.  And must not that which changes come into a state of being other than its previous one, and perish, so far as its previous state is concerned;\nwhereas that which does not change neither comes into being nor perishes?  That is inevitable.  Then the non-existent one, when it is changed, comes into being and perishes, and when it is not changed, neither comes into being nor perishes and thus the non-existent one both comes into being and perishes and neither comes into being nor perishes.  Quite true.Let us now go back again to the beginning and see whether the conclusions we reach will be the same as at present, or different.  Yes, we should do that.  We ask, then, if the one is not,\nwhat will be the consequences in regard to it?  Yes.  Does the expression 'is not' denote anything else than the absence of existence in that of which we say that it is not?  No, nothing else.  And when we say that a thing is not, do we mean that it is in a way and is not in a way? Or does the expression 'is not' mean without any qualifications that the non-existent is not in any way, shape, or manner, and does not participate in being in any way?  Without any qualifications whatsoever.  Then the non-existent cannot be and cannot in any other way partake of existence.\nNo.  But were coming into being and perishing anything else than receiving and losing existence.  No, nothing else.  But that which has no participation in it can neither receive it nor lose it.  Of course not.  Then the one, since it does not exist in any way, cannot possess or lose or share in existence at all.  That is reasonable.  Then the non-existent one neither perishes nor comes into being, since it participates in no way in existence.  No; that is clear.  Then it is not changed in nature at all;\nfor such change involves coming into being and perishing.  True.  And if it is not changed, it cannot move, either, can it?  Certainly not.  And we cannot say that that which is nowhere is at rest; for that which is at rest must always be in some place which is the same.  Yes, of course, the same place.  Thus we shall say again that the non-existent one is neither at rest nor in motion.  No, neither.  Nor can anything which exists pertain to it for the moment it partook of anything which exists it would partake of existence.\nThat is plain.  Then neither greatness nor smallness nor equality pertains to it.  No.  Nor likeness nor difference, either in relation to itself or to other things.  Clearly not.  And can other things pertain to it, if nothing pertains to it?  Impossible.  Then the other things are neither like it nor unlike it, nor the same nor different.  No.  Well, then, will the notions 'of that' or 'to that' or 'some,' or 'this' or 'of this' \nor 'of another' or 'to another' or past or future or present or knowledge or opinion or perception or definition or name or anything else which exists pertain to the non-existent?  No.  Then the non-existent one has no state or condition whatsoever.  It appears to have none whatsoever.  Let us then discuss further what happens to the other things, if the one does not exist.  Let us do so.  Well, they must exist; for if others do not even exist, there could be no talking about the others.  True.  But if we talk about the others, the others are different. Or do you not regard the words other and different as synonymous?\nYes, I do.  And we say that the different is different from the different, and the other is other than the other?  Yes.  Then if the others are to be others, there must be something of which they will be others.  Yes, there must be.  Now what can that be? For they cannot be others of the one, if it does not exist.  No.  Then they are others of each other; for they have no alternative, except to be others of nothing.  True.  They are each, then, others of each other, in groups; for they cannot be so one at a time, if one does not exist.\nBut each mass of them is unlimited in number, and even if you take what seems to be the smallest bit, it suddenly changes, like something in a dream that which seemed to be one is seen to be many, and instead of very small it is seen to be very great in comparison with the minute fractions of it.  Very true.  Such masses of others would be others of each other, if others exist and one does not exist.  Certainly.  There will, then, be many masses, each of which appears to be one, but is not one, if one does not exist?  Yes.\nAnd they will seem to possess, number, if each seems to be one and they are many.  Certainly.  And some will seem to be even and others odd, but all that will be unreal, if the one does not exist.  True.  And there will, we assert, seem to be a smallest among them but this proves to be many and great in comparison with each of the many minute fractions.\nOf course.  And each mass will be considered equal to the many minute fractions for it could not appear to pass from greater to smaller, without seeming to enter that which is between them; hence the appearance of equality.  That is reasonable.  And although it has a limit in relation to another mass, it has neither beginning nor limit nor middle in relation to itself?  Why is that?  Because whenever the mind conceives of any of these as belonging to the masses, another beginning appears before the beginning,\nanother end remains after the end, and in the middle are other more central middles than the middle, but smaller, because it is impossible to conceive of each one of them, since the one does not exist.  Very true.  So all being which is conceived by any mind must, it seems to me, be broken up into minute fractions; for it would always be conceived as a mass devoid of one.  Certainly.  Now anything of that sort, if seen from a distance and dimly, must appear to be one,\nbut if seen from close at hand and with keen vision, each apparent one must prove to be unlimited in number, if it is really devoid of one, and one does not exist.  Am I right?  That is perfectly conclusive.  Therefore the other things must each and all appear to be unlimited and limited and one and many, if the things other than one exist and one does not.  Yes, they must.  And will they not also appear to be like and unlike?  Why?  Just as things in a picture, when viewed from a distance, appear to be all in one and the same condition and alike.\nCertainly.  But when you come close to them they appear to be many and different, and, because of their difference in appearance, different in kind and unlike each other.  Yes.  And so the groups of the other things must appear to be like and unlike themselves and each other.  Certainly.  And also the same and different, and in contact with one another and separated, and in all kinds of motion and in every sort of rest, and coming into being and perishing, and neither of the two, and all that sort of thing, which we can easily mention in detail,\nif the many exist and the one does not.  Very true.Let us, then, go back once more to the beginning and tell the consequences, if the others exist and the one does not.  Let us do so.  Well, the others will not be one?  Of course not.  Nor will they be many for if they were many, one would be contained in them. And if none of them is one, they are all nothing, so that they cannot be many.  True.  If one is not contained in the others, the others are neither many nor one.\nNo.  And they do not even appear to be one or many.  Why is that?  Because the others have no communion in any way whatsoever with anything which is non-existent, and nothing that is non-existent pertains to any of the others, for things that are non-existent have no parts.  True.  Nor is there any opinion or appearance of the non-existent in connection with the others, nor is the non-existent conceived of in any way whatsoever as related to the others.  No.  Then if one does not exist,\nnone of the others will be conceived of as being one or as being many, either; for it is impossible to conceive of many without one.  True, it is impossible.  Then if one does not exist, the others neither are nor are conceived to be either one or many.  No so it seems.  Nor like nor unlike.  No.  Nor the same nor different, nor in contact nor separate, nor any of the other things which we were saying they appeared to be. The others neither are nor appear to be any of these, if the one does not exist.\nTrue.  Then if we were to say in a word, 'if the one is not, nothing is,' should we be right?  Most assuredly.  Then let us say that, and we may add, as it appears, that whether the one is or is not, the one and the others in relation to themselves and to each other all in every way are and are not and appear and do not appear.  Very true."}}}}, {"@n": "Phileb.", "body": {"head": "Philebus", "castList": {"castItem": [{"@type": "role", "role": {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,2674867", "#text": "Socrates"}}}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Protarchus"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Philebus"}]}, "milestone": [{"@unit": "page", "@n": "11"}, {"@n": "11a", "@unit": "section"}], "sp": [{"speaker": "Socrates", "p": {"milestone": {"@n": "11b", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "Observe, then, Protarchus, what the doctrine is which you are now to accept from Philebus, and what our doctrine is, against which you are to argue, if you do not agree with it. \nShall we make a brief statement of each of them?"}}, {"speaker": "Protarchus", "p": "By all means."}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": {"milestone": {"@n": "11c", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "Very well:  Philebus says that to all living beings enjoyment and pleasure and gaiety and whatever accords with that sort of thing are a good;  whereas our contention is that not these, but wisdom and thought and memory and their kindred, right opinion and true reasonings,\nare better and more excellent than pleasure for all who are capable of taking part in them, and that for all those now existing or to come who can partake of them they are the most advantageous of all things.

The day before yesterday I chanced to be going up to town from my house in Phalerum, when one of my acquaintance caught sight of me from behind, some way off, and called in a bantering tone Hullo, Phalerian!  I say, Apollodorus, wait a moment.  So I stopped and waited.  Then, Apollodorus, he said, do you know, I have just been looking for you, as I want to hear all about the banquet that brought together Agathon\nand Socrates and Alcibiades and the rest of that party, and what were the speeches they delivered upon love.  For somebody else was relating to me the account he had from Phoenix, son of Philip, and he mentioned that you knew it too.  But he could not tell it at all clearly so you must give me the whole story, for you are the most proper reporter of your dear friend's discourses.  But first tell me this, he went on; were you at that party yourself, or not?  To which my answer was:  You have had anything but\na clear account from your informant, if you suppose the party you are asking about to have been such a recent affair that I could be included.  So I did suppose, he said.  How so, Glaucon? said I.  You must know it is many a year that Agathon has been away from home and country, and not yet three years that I have been consorting with Socrates and making it my daily care to know whatever he says or does.  Before that time,\nwhat with running about at random and thinking I did things, I was the wretchedest man alive; just as you are at present, thinking philosophy is none of your business.  Instead of jeering at me, he said, tell me when it was that this party took place.  When you and I were only children, I told him; on the occasion of Agathon's victory with his first tragedy:  the day after that of the dedicatory feast which he and his players held for its celebration.  Ah, quite a long while ago, it would seem, said he; but who gave you the account of it?  Socrates himself?  Goodness, no! I answered.  It was the person who told Phoenix\nAristodemus of Cydathenaeum, a little man, who went always barefoot.  He was of the company there, being one of the chief among Socrates' lovers at that time, I believe.  But all the same, I have since questioned Socrates on some details of the story I had from his friend, and he acknowledged them to be in accordance with his account.  Come then, he said, let me have it now; and in fact the road up to town is well suited for telling and hearing as we go along.So on we went, discoursing the while of this affair;\nand hence, as I began by saying, I have it pretty well by heart.  So, friends, if you too must hear the whole story, I had better tell it.  For my own part, indeed, I commonly find that, setting aside the benefit I conceive they do me, I take an immense delight in philosophic discourses, whether I speak them myself or hear them from others:  whereas in the case of other sorts of talkespecially that of your wealthy, money-bag friendsI am not only annoyed myself but sorry for dear intimates like you, who think you are doing a great deal when you really do nothing at all.\nFrom your point of view, I daresay, I seem a hapless creature, and I think your thought is true.

He said that he met with Socrates fresh from the bath and wearing his best pair of slippersquite rare events with himand asked him whither he was bound in such fine trim.To dinner at Agathon's, he answered.  I evaded him and his celebrations yesterday, fearing the crowd; but I agreed to be present today.  So I got myself up in this handsome style in order to be a match for my handsome host.  Now tell me, said he, do you feel in the mood\nfor going unasked to dinner?For anything, he said he replied, that you may bid me do.Come along then, he said; let us corrupt the proverb with a new version:  What if they go of their own accord,The good men to our Goodman's board?Though indeed Homer may be said to have not merely corrupted the adage, but debauched it:  for after setting forth Agamemnon as a man eminently good at warfare,\nand Menelaus as only  he makes the latter come unbidden to the banquet of the former, who was offering sacrifice and holding a feast; so the worse man was the guest of the better.To this my friend's answer, as he told me, was:  I am afraid mine, most likely, is a case that fits not your version, Socrates, but Homer'sa dolt coming unbidden to the banquet of a scholar.  Be sure, then, to have your excuse quite ready when you bring me; for I shall not own to coming unasked,\nbut only on your invitation.If two go along together, he remarked, there's one before another in devising what we are to say.  Well, off we go.After some such conversation, he told me, they started off.  Then Socrates, becoming absorbed in his own thoughts by the way, fell behind him as they went; and when my friend began to wait for him he bade him go on ahead.\nSo he came to Agathon's house, and found the door open; where he found himself in a rather ridiculous position.  For he was met immediately by a servant from within, who took him where the company was reclining, and he found them just about to dine.  However, as soon as Agathon saw him Ha, Aristodemus, he cried, right welcome to a place at table with us!  If you came on some other errand, put it off to another time:  only yesterday I went round to invite you, but failed to see you.  But how is it you do not bring us Socrates?At that I turned back for Socrates, he said, but saw no sign of him coming after me:  so I told them how I myself had come along with Socrates, since he had asked me to dine with them.Very good of you to come, he said, but where is the man?\nHe was coming in just now behind me:  I am wondering myself where he can be.Go at once, said Agathon to the servant, and see if you can fetch in Socrates.  You, Aristodemus, take a place by Eryximachus.So the attendant washed him and made him ready for reclining, when another of the servants came in with the news that our good Socrates had retreated into their neighbors' porch; there he was standing, and when bidden to come in, he refused.How strange!  said Agathon, you must go on bidding him, and by no means let him go.\nBut this Aristodemus forbade:  No, said he, let him alone; it is a habit he has.  Occasionally he turns aside, anywhere at random, and there he stands.  He will be here presently, I expect.  So do not disturb him; let him be.Very well then, said Agathon, as you judge best.  Come, boys, he called to the servants, serve the feast for the rest of us.  You are to set on just whatever you please, now that you have no one to direct you (a method I have never tried before).  Today you are to imagine that I and all the company here have come on your invitation so look after us, and earn our compliments.\nThereupon, he said, they all began dinner, but Socrates did not arrive; and though Agathon ever and anon gave orders that they should go and fetch him, my friend would not allow it.  When he did come, it was after what, for him, was no great delay, as they were only about halfway through dinner.  Then Agathon, who happened to be sitting alone in the lowest place, said:  Here, Socrates, come sit by me, so that by contact with you\nI may have some benefit from that piece of wisdom that occurred to you there in the porch.  Clearly you have made the discovery and got hold of it for you would not have come away before.Then Socrates sat down, and How fine it would be, Agathon, he said, if wisdom were a sort of thing that could flow out of the one of us who is fuller into him who is emptier, by our mere contact with each other, as water will flow through wool from the fuller cup into the emptier.  If such is indeed the case with wisdom, I set a great value on my sitting next to you:\nI look to be filled with excellent wisdom drawn in abundance out of you.  My own is but meagre, as disputable as a dream; but yours is bright and expansive, as the other day we saw it shining forth from your youth, strong and splendid, in the eyes of more than thirty thousand Greeks.You rude mocker, Socrates!  said Agathon.  A little later on you and I shall go to law on this matter of our wisdom, and Dionysus shall be our judge.  For the present, let the dinner be your first concern.\nAfter this, it seems, when Socrates had taken his place and had dined with the rest, they made libation and sang a chant to the god and so forth, as custom bids, till they betook them to drinking.  Then Pausanias opened a conversation after this manner:  Well, gentlemen, what mode of drinking will suit us best?  For my part, to tell the truth, I am in very poor form as a result of yesterday's bout, and I claim a little relief; it is so, I believe, with most of you, for you were at yesterday's party:  so consider what method\nof drinking would suit us best.On this Aristophanes observed:  Now that, Pausanias, is a good suggestion of yours, that we make a point of consulting our comfort in our cups:  for I myself am one of those who got such a soaking yesterday.When Eryximachus, son of Acumenus, heard this; You are quite right, sirs, he said; and there is yet one other question on which I request your opinion, as to what sort of condition Agathon finds himself in for drinking.No, no, said Agathon, I am not in good condition for it either.\nIt would be a piece of luck for us, I take it, the other went on, that is, for me, Aristodemus, Phaedrus, and our friends here, if you who are the stoutest drinkers are now feeling exhausted.  We, of course, are known weaklings.  Socrates I do not count in the matter:  he is fit either way, and will be content with whichever choice we make.  Now as it appears that nobody here present is eager for copious draughts, perhaps it will be the less irksome to you if I speak of intoxication, and tell you truly what it is.  The practice of medicine, I find, has made this clear to me\nthat drunkenness is harmful to mankind; and neither would I myself agree, if I could help it, to an excess of drinking, nor would I recommend it to another, especially when his head is still heavy from a bout of the day before.Here Phaedrus of Myrrhinus interrupted him, saying:  Why, you know I always obey you, above all in medical matters; and so now will the rest of us, if they are well advised.  Then all of them, on hearing this,\nconsented not to make their present meeting a tipsy affair, but to drink just as it might serve their pleasure.Since it has been resolved, then, said Eryximachus, that we are to drink only so much as each desires, with no constraint on any, I next propose that the flute-girl who came in just now be dismissed:  let her pipe to herself or, if she likes, to the women-folk within, but let us seek our entertainment today in conversation.  I am ready, if you so desire, to suggest what sort of discussion it should be.\nThey all said they did so desire, and bade him make his proposal.  So Eryximachus proceeded:  The beginning of what I have to say is in the words of Euripides' Melanippe, for not mine the tale that I intend to tell; it comes from Phaedrus here.  He is constantly complaining to me and saying,Is it not a curious thing, Eryximachus, that while other gods have hymns and psalms indited in their honor by the poets, the god of Love, so ancient and so great,\n\nhas had no song of praise composed for him by a single one of all the many poets that ever have been?  And again, pray consider our worthy professors, and the eulogies they frame of Hercules and others in prose,for example, the excellent Prodicus.  This indeed is not so surprising but I recollect coming across a book by somebody, in which I found Salt superbly lauded for its usefulness, and many more such matters\nI could show you celebrated there.  To think of all this bustle about such trifles, and not a single man ever essaying till this day to make a fitting hymn to Love!  So great a god, and so neglected!  Now I think Phaedrus's protest a very proper one.  Accordingly I am not only desirous of obliging him with a contribution of my own, but I also pronounce the present to be a fitting occasion for us here assembled to honor the god.\nSo if you on your part approve, we might pass the time well enough in discourses; for my opinion is that we ought each of us to make a speech in turn, from left to right, praising Love as beautifully as he can.  Phaedrus shall open first; for he has the topmost place at table, and besides is father of our debate.No one, Eryximachus, said Socrates, will vote against you:  I do not see how I could myself decline,\nwhen I set up to understand nothing but love-matters; nor could Agathon and Pausanias either, nor yet Aristophanes, who divides his time between Dionysus and Aphrodite; nor could any other of the persons I see before me.  To be sure, we who sit at the bottom do not get a fair chance:  but if the earlier speakers rise nobly to the occasion, we shall be quite content.  So now let Phaedrus, with our best wishes, make a beginning and give us a eulogy of Love.To this they assented one and all,\nbidding him do as Socrates said.  Now the entire speech in each case was beyond Aristodemus's recollection, and so too the whole of what he told me is beyond mine:  but those parts which, on account also of the speakers, I deemed most memorable, I will tell you successively as they were delivered. First then, as I said, he told me that the speech of Phaedrus began with points of this sortthat Love was a great god, among men and gods a marvel; and this appeared in many ways, but notably in his birth.\nOf the most venerable are the honors of this god, and the proof of it is this:  parents of Love there are none, nor are any recorded in either prose or verse.  Hesiod says that Chaos came first into beingAcusilaus also agrees with Hesiod, saying that after Chaos were born these two, Earth and Love.  Parmenides says of Birth that she \nThus Love is by various authorities allowed to be of most venerable standing; and as most venerable, he is the cause of all our highest blessings.  I for my part am at a loss to say what greater blessing a man can have in earliest youth than an honorable lover, or a lover than an honorable favorite.  For the guiding principle we should choose for all our days, if we are minded to live a comely life, cannot be acquired either by kinship or office or wealth\nor anything so well as by Love.  What shall I call this power?  The shame that we feel for shameful things, and ambition for what is noble; without which it is impossible for city or person to perform any high and noble deeds.  Let me then say that a man in love, should he be detected in some shameful act or in a cowardly submission to shameful treatment at another's hands, would not feel half so much distress at anyone observing it, whether father or comrade or anyone in the world, as when his favorite did;\nand in the selfsame way we see how the beloved is especially ashamed before his lovers when he is observed to be about some shameful business.  So that if we could somewise contrive to have a city or an army composed of lovers and their favorites, they could not be better citizens of their country than by thus refraining from all that is base\n\nin a mutual rivalry for honor; and such men as these, when fighting side by side, one might almost consider able to make even a little band victorious over all the world.  For a man in love would surely choose to have all the rest of the host rather than his favorite see him forsaking his station or flinging away his arms; sooner than this, he would prefer to die many deaths:  while, as for leaving his favorite in the lurch, or not succoring him in his peril, no man is such a craven that Love's own influence cannot inspire him with a valor that makes him equal to the bravest born;\nand without doubt what Homer calls a  by a god in certain heroes is the effect produced on lovers by Love's peculiar power.Furthermore, only such as are in love will consent to die for others; not merely men will do it, but women too.  Sufficient witness is borne to this statement before the people of  by Alcestis, daughter of Pelias, who alone was willing to die for her husband, though he had both father\nand mother.  So high did her love exalt her over them in kindness, that they were proved alien to their son and but nominal relations; and when she achieved this deed, it was judged so noble by gods as well as men that, although among all the many doers of noble deeds they are few and soon counted to whom the gods have granted the privilege of having their souls sent up again from Hades, hers they thus restored in admiration of her act.\nIn this manner even the gods give special honor to zeal and courage in concerns of love.  But Orpheus, son of Oeagrus, they sent back with failure from Hades, showing him only a wraith of the woman for whom he came; her real self they would not bestow, for he was accounted to have gone upon a coward's quest, too like the minstrel that he was, and to have lacked the spirit to die as Alcestis did for the sake of love, when he contrived the means of entering Hades alive.  Wherefore they laid upon him the penalty he deserved, and caused him to meet his death\nat the hands of women:  whereas Achilles, son of Thetis, they honored and sent to his place in the Isles of the Blest, because having learnt from his mother that he would die as surely as he slew Hector, but if he slew him not, would return home and end his days an aged man, he bravely chose to go and rescue his lover Patroclus,\navenged him, and sought death not merely in his behalf but in haste to be joined with him whom death had taken.  For this the gods so highly admired him that they gave him distinguished honor, since he set so great a value on his lover.  And Aeschylus talks nonsense when he says that it was Achilles who was in love with Patroclus; for he excelled in beauty not Patroclus alone but assuredly all the other heroes, being still beardless and, moreover, much the younger, by Homer's account.  For in truth\nthere is no sort of valor more respected by the gods than this which comes of love; yet they are even more admiring and delighted and beneficent when the beloved is fond of his lover than when the lover is fond of his favorite; since a lover, filled as he is with a god, surpasses his favorite in divinity.  This is the reason why they honored Achilles above Alcestis, giving him his abode in the Isles of the Blest.So there is my description of Lovethat he is the most venerable and valuable of the gods, and that he has sovereign power to provide all virtue and happiness for men whether living or departed.\nSuch in the main was Phaedrus' speech as reported to me.  It was followed by several others, which my friend could not recollect at all clearly; so he passed them over and related that of Pausanias, which ran as follows:  I do not consider, Phaedrus, our plan of speaking a good one, if the rule is simply that we are to make eulogies of Love.  If Love were only one, it would be right; but, you see, he is not one, and this being the case, it would be more correct to have it previously announced\nwhat sort we ought to praise.  Now this defect I will endeavor to amend, and will first decide on a Love who deserves our praise, and then will praise him in terms worthy of his godhead.  We are all aware that there is no Aphrodite or Love-passion without a Love.  True, if that goddess were one, then Love would be one:  but since there are two of her, there must needs be two Loves also.  Does anyone doubt that she is double?  Surely there is the elder, of no mother born, but daughter of Heaven, whence we name her Heavenly; while the younger was the child of Zeus and Dione, and her we call Popular.\nIt follows then that of the two Loves also the one ought to be called Popular, as fellow-worker with the one of those goddesses, and the other Heavenly.  All gods, of course, ought to be praised:  but none the less I must try to describe the faculties of each of these two.  For of every action\nit may be observed that as acted by itself it is neither noble nor base.  For instance, in our conduct at this moment, whether we drink or sing or converse, none of these things is noble in itself; each only turns out to be such in the doing, as the manner of doing it may be.  For when the doing of it is noble and right, the thing itself becomes noble; when wrong, it becomes base.  So also it is with loving, and Love is not in every case noble or worthy of celebration, but only when he impels us to love in a noble manner.Now the Love that belongs to the Popular Aphrodite is in very truth\npopular and does his work at haphazard:  this is the Love we see in the meaner sort of men; who, in the first place, love women as well as boys; secondly, where they love, they are set on the body more than the soul; and thirdly, they choose the most witless people they can find, since they look merely to the accomplishment and care not if the manner be noble or no.  Hence they find themselves doing everything at haphazard, good or its opposite, without distinction:\nfor this Love proceeds from the goddess who is far the younger of the two, and who in her origin partakes of both female and male.  But the other Love springs from the Heavenly goddess who, firstly, partakes not of the female but only of the male; and secondly, is the elder, untinged with wantonness:  wherefore those who are inspired by this Love betake them to the male, in fondness for what has the robuster nature and a larger share of mind.  Even in the passion for boys you may note the way of those who are under the single incitement of this Love:\nthey love boys only when they begin to acquire some minda growth associated with that of down on their chins.  For I conceive that those who begin to love them at this age are prepared to be always with them and share all with them as long as life shall last:  they will not take advantage of a boy's green thoughtlessness to deceive him and make a mock of him by running straight off to another.  Against this love of boys a law should have been enacted,\nto prevent the sad waste of attentions paid to an object so uncertain:  for who can tell where a boy will end at last, vicious or virtuous in body and soul?  Good men, however, voluntarily make this law for themselves, and it is a rule which those popular lovers ought to be forced to obey,\njust as we force them, so far as we can, to refrain from loving our freeborn women.  These are the persons responsible for the scandal which prompts some to say it is a shame to gratify one's lover:  such are the cases they have in view, for they observe all their reckless and wrongful doings; and surely, whatsoever is done in an orderly and lawful manner can never justly bring reproach.Further, it is easy to note the rule with regard to love in other cities:  there it is laid down in simple terms, while ours here is complicated.  For in \nand  and where there is no skill in speech they have simply an ordinance that it is seemly to gratify lovers, and no one whether young or old will call it shameful, in order, I suppose, to save themselves the trouble of trying what speech can do to persuade the youths; for they have no ability for speaking.  But in  and many other regions where they live under foreign sway, it is counted a disgrace.  Foreigners hold this thing,\nand all training in philosophy and sports, to be disgraceful, because of their despotic government; since, I presume, it is not to the interest of their princes to have lofty notions engendered in their subjects, or any strong friendships and communions; all of which Love is pre-eminently apt to create.  It is a lesson that our despots learnt by experience; for Aristogeiton's love and Harmodius's friendship grew to be so steadfast that it wrecked their power.  Thus where it was held a disgrace to gratify one's lover, the tradition is due to the evil ways of those who made such a law\nthat is, to the encroachments of the rulers and to the cowardice of the ruled.  But where it was accepted as honorable without any reserve, this was due to a sluggishness of mind in the law-makers.  In our city we have far better regulations, which, as I said, are not so easily grasped.Consider, for instance, our saying that it is more honorable to love openly than in secret, especially when the beloved excels not so much in beauty as in nobility and virtue; and again, what a wonderful encouragement a lover gets from us all:\nwe have no thought of his doing anything unseemly, and success in his pursuit is counted honorable and failure disgraceful; and how in his endeavors for success our law leaves him a free hand for performing such admirable acts as may win him praise; while the same acts, if attempted for any other purpose\nor effect to which one might be inclined, would bring one nothing in return but the sharpest reproach.  For suppose that with the view of gaining money from another, or some office, or any sort of influence, a man should allow himself to behave as lovers commonly do to their favoritespressing their suit with supplications and entreaties, binding themselves with vows, sleeping on doorsteps, and submitting to such slavery as no slave would ever endureboth the friends and the enemies of such a man would hinder his behaving in such fashion;\nfor while the latter would reproach him with adulation and ill-breeding, the former would admonish him and feel ashamed of his conduct.  But in a lover all such doings only win him favor:  by free grant of our law he may behave thus without reproach, as compassing a most honorable end.  Strangest of all, he alone in the vulgar opinion has indulgence from the gods when he forsakes the vow he has sworn; for the vow of love-passion, they say, is no vow.  So true it is that both gods\n\nand men have given absolute licence to the lover, as our Athenian law provides.  Thus far, then, we have ground for supposing that here in our city both loving some one and showing affection to one's lover are held in highest honor.  But it happens that fathers put tutors in charge of their boys when they are beloved, to prevent them from conversing with their lovers:  the tutor has strict injunctions on the matter, and when they observe a boy to be guilty of such a thing his playmates and fellows reproach him,\nwhile his reproachers are not in their turn withheld or upbraided by their elders as speaking amiss; and from this it might rather be inferred that his behavior is held to be a great disgrace in .  Yet the truth of it, I think, is this:  the affair is no simple thing; you remember we said that by itself it was neither noble nor base, but that it was noble if nobly conducted, and base if basely.  To do the thing basely is to gratify a wicked man in a wicked manner:  nobly means having to do with a good man in a noble manner.  By wicked we mean that popular lover, who craves the body rather than the soul:\nas he is not in love with what abides, he himself is not abiding.  As soon as the bloom of the body he so loved begins to fade he flutters off and is gone, leaving all his speeches and promises dishonored:  whereas the lover of a nature that is worthy abides throughout life,\nas being fused into one with the abiding.Now our law has a sure and excellent test for the trial of these persons, showing which are to be favored and which to be shunned.  In the one case, accordingly, it encourages pursuit, but flight in the other, applying ordeals and tests in each case, whereby we are able to rank the lover and the beloved on this side or on that.  And so it is for this reason that our convention regards a quick capitulation as a disgrace:  for there ought, first, to be a certain intervalthe generally approved touchstoneof time; and, second, it is disgraceful if the surrender is due to gold or public preferment,\nor is a mere cowering away from the endurance of ill-treatment, or shows the youth not properly contemptuous of such benefits as he may receive in pelf or political success.  For in these there appears nothing steadfast or abiding, unless it be the impossibility of their producing a noble friendship.  One way remains in our custom whereby a favorite may rightly gratify his lover:\nit is our rule that, just as in the case of the lovers it was counted no flattery or scandal for them to be willingly and utterly enslaved to their favorites, so there is left one sort of voluntary thraldom which is not scandalous; I mean, in the cause of virtue.It is our settled tradition that when a man freely devotes his service to another in the belief that his friend will make him better in point of wisdom, it may be, or in any of the other parts of virtue, this willing bondage also is no sort of baseness or flattery.  Let us compare the two rules\none dealing with the passion for boys, and the other with the love of wisdom and all virtuous ways:  by this we shall see if we are to conclude it a good thing that a favorite should gratify his lover.  For when lover and favorite come together, each guided by his own ruleon the one side, of being justified in doing any service to the favorite who has obliged him, and on the other, of being justified in showing any attentions to the friend who makes him wise and good; the elder of his plenty contributing to intellectual\nand all other excellence, the younger in his paucity acquiring education and all learned arts:  only then, at the meeting of these two principles in one place, only then and there, and in no other case, can it befall that a favorite may honorably indulge his lover.  To have such hopes deceived is no disgrace; while those of any other sort must be disgraceful, whether deceived or not.\nFor suppose that a youth had a lover he deemed to be wealthy and, after obliging him for the sake of his wealth, were to find himself deceived and no money to be got, since the lover proved to be poor; this would be disgraceful all the same; since the youth may be said to have revealed his character, and shown himself ready to do anyone any service for pelf, and this is not honorable.  By the same token, when a youth gratifies a friend, supposing him to be a good man and expecting to be made better himself as a result of his lover's affection,\nand then finds he is deceived, since his friend proves to be vile and destitute of virtue; even so the deception is honorable.  For this youth is also held to have discovered his nature, by showing that he would make anyone the object of his utmost ardor for the sake of virtuous improvement; and this by contrast is supremely honorable.  Thus by all means it is right to bestow this favor for the sake of virtue.This is the Love that belongs to the Heavenly Goddess, heavenly itself and precious to both public and private life:  for this compels lover and beloved alike\nto feel a zealous concern for their own virtue.  But lovers of the other sort belong all to the other Goddess, the Popular.  Such, Phaedrus, is the contribution I am able to offer you, on the spur of the moment, towards the discussion of Love.Pausanias' praise made a pause with this phraseyou see what jingles the schoolmen are teaching me!  The next speaker, so Aristodemus told me, was to have been Aristophanes:  but a surfeit or some other cause had chanced to afflict him with a hiccough, which prevented him from speaking; and he could only just say\nto Eryximachus the doctor, whose place was next below him, I look to you Eryximachus, either to stop my hiccough, or to speak in my stead until I can stop it.  Why, I will do both, replied Eryximachus for I will take your turn for speaking, and when you have stopped it, you shall take mine.  But during my speech, if on your holding your breath a good while the hiccough chooses to stop, well and good; otherwise, you must gargle with some water.\nIf, however, it is a very stubborn one, take something that will tickle your nostrils, and sneeze:  do this once or twice, and though it be of the stubbornest, it will stop.  Start away with your speech, said Aristophanes, and I will do as you advise. Then Eryximachus spoke as follows:  Well then, since Pausanias did not properly finish off\nthe speech he began so well, I must do my best to append a conclusion thereto.  His division of Love into two sorts appears to me a good one:  but medicine, our great mystery, has taught me to observe that Love is not merely an impulse of human souls towards beautiful men but the attraction of all creatures to a great variety of things, which works in the bodies of all animals and all growths upon the earth, and practically in everything that is; and I have learnt\nhow mighty and wonderful and universal is the sway of this god over all affairs both human and divine.  Reverence for my profession prompts me to begin with the witness of medicine.  This double Love belongs to the nature of all bodies:  for between bodily health and sickness there is an admitted difference or dissimilarity, and what is dissimilar craves and loves dissimilar things.  Hence the desire felt by a sound body is quite other than that of a sickly one.  Now I agree with what Pausanias was just saying, that it is right to gratify\ngood men, base to gratify the dissolute:  similarly, in treating actual bodies it is right and necessary to gratify the good and healthy elements of each, and this is what we term the physician's skill; but it is a disgrace to do aught but disappoint the bad and sickly parts, if one aims at being an adept.  For the art of medicine may be summarily described as a knowledge of the love-matters of the body in regard to repletion and evacuation;\nand the master-physician is he who can distinguish there between the nobler and baser Loves, and can effect such alteration that the one passion is replaced by the other; and he will be deemed a good practitioner who is expert in producing Love where it ought to flourish but exists not, and in removing it from where it should not be.  Indeed he must be able to make friends and happy lovers of the keenest opponents in the body.  Now the most contrary qualities are most hostile to each othercold and hot, bitter and sweet, dry and moist, and the rest of them.  It was by knowing how to foster\nlove and unanimity in these that, as our two poets here relate, and as I myself believe, our forefather Asclepius composed this science of ours.  And so not merely is all medicine governed, as I propound it, through the influence of this god, but likewise athletics and agriculture.\nMusic also, as is plain to any the least curious observer, is in the same sort of case:  perhaps Heracleitus intends as much by those perplexing words,  The One at variance with itself is drawn together, like harmony of bow or lyre.  Now it is perfectly absurd to speak of a harmony at variance, or as formed from things still varying.  Perhaps he meant, however, that\nfrom the grave and acute which were varying before, but which afterwards came to agreement, the harmony was by musical art created.  For surely there can be no harmony of acute and grave while still at variance:  harmony is consonance, and consonance is a kind of agreement; and agreement of things varying, so long as they are at variance, is impossible.  On the other hand, when a thing varies with no disability of agreement, then it may be harmonized; just as rhythm\nis produced by fast and slow, which in the beginning were at variance but later came to agree.  In all these cases the agreement is brought about by music which, like medicine in the former instance, introduces a mutual love and unanimity.  Hence in its turn music is found to be a knowledge of love-matters relating to harmony and rhythm.  In the actual system of harmony or rhythm we can easily distinguish these love-matters; as yet the double Love is absent:  but when we come to the application\nof rhythm and harmony to social life, whether we construct what are called melodies' or render correctly, by what is known as training, tunes and measures already constructed, we find here a certain difficulty and require a good craftsman.  Round comes the same conclusion:  well-ordered men, and the less regular only so as to bring them to better order, should be indulged in this Love, and this is the sort we should preserve; this is the noble, the Heavenly Love,\nsprung from the Heavenly Muse.  But the Popular Love comes from the Queen of Various Song; in applying him we must proceed with all caution, that no debauchery be implanted with the reaping of his pleasure, just as in our craft we set high importance on a right use of the appetite for dainties of the table, that we may cull the pleasure without disease.  Thus in music and medicine and every other affair whether human or divine, we must be on the watch as far as may be for either sort of Love;\nfor both are there.Note how even the system of the yearly seasons is full of these two forces; how the qualities I mentioned just now, heat and cold, drought and moisture, when brought together by the orderly Love, and taking on a temperate harmony as they mingle, become bearers of ripe fertility and health to men and animals and plants, and are guilty of no wrong.  But when the wanton-spirited Love gains the ascendant in the seasons of the year, great destruction\nand wrong does he wreak.  For at these junctures are wont to arise pestilences and many other varieties of disease in beasts and herbs; likewise hoar-frosts, hails, and mildews, which spring from mutual encroachments and disturbances in such love-connections as are studied in relation to the motions of the stars and the yearly seasons by what we term astronomy.  So further, all sacrifices and ceremonies controlled by divination,\nnamely, all means of communion between gods and men, are only concerned with either the preservation or the cure of Love.  For impiety is usually in each case the result of refusing to gratify the orderly Love or to honor and prefer him in all our affairs, and of yielding to the other in questions of duty towards one's parents whether alive or dead, and also towards the gods.  To divination is appointed the task of supervising and treating the health of these Loves; wherefore that art,\nas knowing what human love-affairs will lead to seemliness and pious observance, is indeed a purveyor of friendship betwixt gods and men.Thus Love, conceived as a single whole, exerts a wide, a strong, nay, in short, a complete power:  but that which is consummated for a good purpose, temperately and justly, both here on earth and in heaven above, wields the mightiest power of all and provides us with a perfect bliss; so that we are able to consort with one another and have friendship with the gods who are above us.\nIt may well be that with the best will in the world I have omitted many points in the praise I owe to Love; but any gaps which I may have left it is your business, Aristophanes, to fill:  or if you intend some different manner of glorifying the god, let us hear your eulogy, for you have stopped your hiccough now.\nThen, as my friend related, Aristophanes took up the word and said:  Yes, it has stopped, though not until it was treated with a course of sneezing, such as leaves me wondering that the orderly principle of the body should call for the noises and titillations involved in sneezing; you see, it stopped the very moment I applied the sneeze to it.My good Aristophanes, replied Eryximachus, take heed what you are about.  Here are you buffooning before ever you begin, and compelling me\nto be on the watch for the first absurdity in your speech, when you might deliver it in peace.At this Aristophanes laughed, and Quite right, Eryximachus, he said; I unsay all that I have said.  Do not keep a watch on me for as to what is going to be said, my fear is not so much of saying something absurdsince that would be all to the good and native to my Museas something utterly ridiculous.You think you can just let fly, Aristophanes, and get off unscathed!  Have a good care to speak only what you can defend;\nthough perhaps I may be pleased to let you off altogether.It Is indeed my intention, Eryximachus, said Aristophanes, to speak in somewhat different strain from you and Pausanias.  For in my opinion humanity has entirely failed to perceive the power of Love:  if men did perceive it, they would have provided him with splendid temples and altars, and would splendidly honor him with sacrifice; whereas we see none of these things done for him, though they are especially his due.\nHe of all gods is most friendly to men; he succors mankind and heals those ills whose cure must be the highest happiness of the human race.  Hence I shall try and introduce you to his power, that you may transmit this teaching to the world at large.  You must begin your lesson with the nature of man and its development.  For our original nature was by no means the same as it is now.  In the first place, there were three kinds of human beings,\nnot merely the two sexes, male and female, as at present:  there was a third kind as well, which had equal shares of the other two, and whose name survives though, the thing itself has vanished.  For man-woman was then a unity in form no less than name, composed of both sexes and sharing equally in male and female; whereas now it has come to be merely a name of reproach.  Secondly, the form of each person was round all over, with back and sides encompassing it every way; each had four arms, and legs to match these, and two faces perfectly alike\non a cylindrical neck.  There was one head to the two faces, which looked opposite ways; there were four ears, two privy members, and all the other parts, as may be imagined, in proportion.  The creature walked upright as now, in either direction as it pleased and whenever it started running fast, it went like our acrobats, whirling over and over with legs stuck out straight; only then they had eight limbs to support and speed them\nswiftly round and round.  The number and features of these three sexes were owing to the fact that the male was originally the offspring of the sun, and the female of the earth; while that which partook of both sexes was born of the moon, for the moon also partakes of both.  They were globular in their shape as in their progress, since they took after their parents.  Now, they were of surprising strength and vigor, and so lofty in their notions that they even conspired against the gods; and the same story is told of them as Homer relates of\nEphialtes and Otus, that scheming to assault the gods in fight they essayed to mount high heaven.Thereat Zeus and the other gods debated what they should do, and were perplexed:  for they felt they could not slay them like the Giants, whom they had abolished root and branch with strokes of thunderit would be only abolishing the honors and observances they had from men; nor yet could they endure such sinful rioting.  Then Zeus, putting all his wits together, spoke at length and said:  Methinks I can contrive that men, without ceasing to exist, shall give over their iniquity through a lessening of their strength.\nI propose now to slice every one of them in two, so that while making them weaker we shall find them more useful by reason of their multiplication; and they shall walk erect upon two legs.  If they continue turbulent and do not choose to keep quiet, I will do it again, said he; I will slice every person in two, and then they must go their ways on one leg, hopping.  So saying, he sliced each human being in two, just as they slice sorb-apples to make a dry preserve, or eggs with hairs;\nand at the cleaving of each he bade Apollo turn its face and half-neck to the section side, in order that every one might be made more orderly by the sight of the knife's work upon him; this done, the god was to heal them up.  Then Apollo turned their faces about, and pulled their skin together from the edges over what is now called the belly, just like purses which you draw close with a string; the little opening he tied up in the middle of the belly, so making what we know as the navel.\nFor the rest, he smoothed away most of the puckers and figured out the breast with some such instrument as shoemakers use in smoothing the wrinkles of leather on the last; though he left there a few which we have just about the belly and navel, to remind us of our early fall.  Now when our first form had been cut in two, each half in longing for its fellow would come to it again; and then would they fling their arms about each other and in mutual embraces\nyearn to be grafted together, till they began to perish of hunger and general indolence, through refusing to do anything apart.  And whenever on the death of one half the other was left alone, it went searching and embracing to see if it might happen on that half of the whole woman which now we call a woman, or perchance the half of the whole man.  In this plight they were perishing away, when Zeus in his pity provided a fresh device.  He moved their privy parts to the frontfor until then they had these, like all else, on the outside, and did their begetting and bringing forth not on each other but on the earth, like the crickets.  These parts he now shifted to the front,\nto be used for propagating on each otherin the female member by means of the male; so that if in their embracements a man should happen on a woman there might be conception and continuation of their kind; and also, if male met with male they might have satiety of their union and a relief, and so might turn their hands to their labors and their interest to ordinary life.  Thus anciently is mutual love ingrained\nin mankind, reassembling our early estate and endeavoring to combine two in one and heal the human sore.Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like a flat-fish the traces of having been sliced in two; and each is ever searching for the tally that will fit him.  All the men who are sections of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are woman-courters; our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex,\n\nwhence likewise are derived our man-courting women and adulteresses.  All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men:  they are inclined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions.  Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be slices of the male by making friends with men and delighting\nto lie with them and to be clasped in men's embraces; these are the finest boys and striplings, for they have the most manly nature.  Some say they are shameless creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come to man's estate\nthey are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in wiving and getting children, but only do these things under stress of custom; they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.  A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind.  Well, when one of themwhether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort\nhappens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be induced to leave each other's side for a single moment.  These are they who continue together throughout life, though they could not even say what they would have of one another.  No one could imagine this to be the mere amorous connection, or that such alone could be the reason why each rejoices in the other's company with so eager a zest:  obviously the soul of each is wishing for something else that it cannot express,\nonly divining and darkly hinting what it wishes.  Suppose that, as they lay together, Hephaestus should come and stand over them, and showing his implements should ask:  What is it, good mortals, that you would have of one another?and suppose that in their perplexity he asked them again:  Do you desire to be joined in the closest possible union, so that you shall not be divided\nby night or by day?  If that is your craving, I am ready to fuse and weld you together in a single piece, that from being two you may be made one; that so long as you live, the pair of you, being as one, may share a single life; and that when you die you may also in Hades yonder be one instead of two, having shared a single death.  Bethink yourselves if this is your heart's desire, and if you will be quite contented with this lot.  No one on hearing this, we are sure, would demur to it or would be found wishing for anything else:  each would unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all the time, namely, to be so joined and fused with his beloved that the two might be made one.The cause of it all is this, that our original form was as I have described, and we were entire; and the craving and pursuit\nof that entirety is called Love.  Formerly, as I have said, we were one; but now for our sins we are all dispersed by God, as the Arcadians were by the Lacedaemonians; and we may well be afraid that if we are disorderly towards Heaven we may once more be cloven asunder and may go about in the shape of those outline-carvings on the tombs, with our noses sawn down the middle, and may thus become like tokens of split dice.  Wherefore we ought all to exhort our neighbors to a pious observance of the gods, in order that we may escape harm\nand attain to bliss under the gallant leadership of Love.  Let none in act oppose himand it is opposing him to incur the hate of Heaven:  if we make friends with the god and are reconciled, we shall have the fortune that falls to few in our day, of discovering our proper favorites.  And let not Eryximachus interrupt my speech with a comic mock,\nand say I refer to Pausanias and Agathon; it may be they do belong to the fortunate few, and are both of them males by nature; what I mean isand this applies to the whole world of men and womenthat the way to bring happiness to our race is to give our love its true fulfillment:  let every one find his own favorite, and so revert to his primal estate.  If this be the best thing of all, the nearest approach to it among all acts open to us now must accordingly be the best to choose; and that is, to find a favorite\nwhose nature is exactly to our mind.  Love is the god who brings this about; he fully deserves our hymns.  For not only in the present does he bestow the priceless boon of bringing us to our very own, but he also supplies this excellent hope for the future, that if we will supply the gods with reverent duty he will restore us to our ancient life and heal and help us into the happiness of the blest.There, Eryximachus, is my discourse on Love, of a different sort from yours.  As I besought you, make no comic sport of it, for we want to hear what the others will say in their turnI rather mean the other two,\nsince only Agathon and Socrates are left.Well, I will obey you, said Eryximachus, for in fact I enjoyed your speech.  Had I not reason to know the prowess of Socrates and Agathon in love-matters, I should have great fears of their being at a loss for eloquence after we have heard it in such copious variety:  but you see, my confidence is unshaken.Whereon Socrates remarked:  Your own performance,\nEryximachus, made a fine hit:  but if you could be where I am nowor rather, I should say, where I shall be when Agathon has spokenyou would be fitly and sorely afraid, and would be as hard put to it as I am.You want to throw a spell over me, Socrates, said Agathon, so that I may be flustered with the consciousness of the high expectations the audience has formed of my discourse.Nay, Agathon, how forgetful I should be, replied Socrates,\nif after noticing your high and manly spirit as you stepped upon the platform with your troupehow you sent a straight glance at that vast assembly to show that you meant to do yourself credit with your production, and how you were not dismayed in the slightestif I should now suppose you could be flustered on account of a few fellows like us.Why, Socrates, said Agathon, I hope you do not always fancy me so puffed up with the playhouse as to forget that an intelligent speaker is more alarmed at a few men of wit than at a host of fools.No, Agathon, it would be wrong of me indeed, said Socrates,\nto associate you with any such clownish notion:  I am quite sure that on finding yourself with a few persons whom you considered clever you would make more account of them than of the multitude.  Yet we, perhaps, are the latter; for we were there, and among the crowd:  but suppose you found yourself with other folk who were clever, you would probably feel ashamed that they should witness any shameful act you might feel yourself to be doing.  Will you agree to that?\nQuite true, he said.Whereas before the multitude you would not be ashamed if you felt you were doing anything shameful?Here Phaedrus interposed:  My dear Agathon, if you go on answering Socrates he will be utterly indifferent to the fate of our present business, so long as he has some one to argue with, especially some one handsome.  For my part, I enjoy listening to Socrates' arguments; but I am responsible for our eulogy of Love, and must levy a speech from every one of you in turn.  Let each of you two, then, give the god his meed before you have your argument.You are quite right, Phaedrus, said Agathon,\nand there is nothing to hinder my speaking; for I shall find many other occasions for arguing with Socrates.I propose first to speak of the plan most proper for my speaking, and after that to speak.  Every one of the previous speakers, instead of eulogizing the god, has merely, as it seems to me, felicitated humanity on the benefits he bestows:  not one of them has told us what is the nature\nof the benefactor himself.  There is but one correct method of giving anyone any kind of praise, namely to make the words unfold the character of him, and of the blessings brought by him, who is to be our theme.  Hence it is meet that we praise him first for what he is and then for what he gives.So I say that, while all gods are blissful, Lovewith no irreverence or offence be it spokenis the most blissful, as being the most beautiful and the best.  How most beautiful, I will explain.  First of all, Phaedrus, he is youngest of the gods.  He himself supplies\nclear evidence of this; for he flies and flees from old agea swift thing obviously, since it gains on us too quickly for our liking.  Love hates it by nature, and refuses to come within any distance of it.  He is ever consorting with the young, and such also is he:  well says the old saw, Like and like together strike.  And though in much else I agree with Phaedrus, in this I agree not, that Love by his account is more ancient than Cronos and Iapetus:\nI say he is youngest of the gods and ever young, while those early dealings with the gods which Hesiod and Parmenides relate, I take to have been the work of Necessity, not of Love, if there is any truth in those stories.  For there would have been no gelding or fettering of each other, nor any of those various violences, if Love had been amongst them; rather only amity and peace, such as now subsist ever since Love has reigned over the gods.  So then he is young, and delicate withal:  he requires a poet such as Homer to set forth his delicacy divine.\nHomer it is who tells of Ate as both divine and delicate; you recollect those delicate feet of hers, where he says So I hold it convincing proof of her delicacy that she goes not on hard things but on soft.\nThe same method will serve us to prove the delicacy of Love.  Not upon earth goes he, nor on our crowns, which are not very soft; but takes his way and abode in the softest things that exist.  The tempers and souls of gods and men are his chosen habitation:  not indeed any soul as much as another; when he comes upon one whose temper is hard, away he goes, but if it be soft, he makes his dwelling there.  So if with feet and every way he is wont ever to get hold of the softest parts of the softest creatures,\nhe needs must be most delicate.  Youngest, then, and most delicate is he, and withal pliant of form:  for he would never contrive to fold himself about us every way, nor begin by stealing in and out of every soul so secretly, if he were hard.  Clear evidence of his fit proportion and pliancy of form is found in his shapely grace, a quality wherein Love is in every quarter allowed to excel:  unshapeliness and Love are ever at war with one another.  Beauty of hue in this god\nis evinced by his seeking his food among flowers:  for Love will not settle on body or soul or aught else that is flowerless or whose flower has faded away; while he has only to light on a plot of sweet blossoms and scents to settle there and stay.Enough has now been said, though much remains unsaid, of the beauty of our god; next shall Love's goodness be my theme.  The strongest plea for this is that neither to a god he gives nor from a god receives any injury, nor from men receives it nor to men gives it.  For neither is the usage he himself gets a violent usage, since violence\ntakes not hold of Love; nor is there violence in his dealings, since Love wins all men's willing service; and agreements on both sides willingly made are held to be just by   Then, over and above his justice, he is richly endowed with temperance.  We all agree that temperance is a control of pleasures and desires, while no pleasure is stronger than Love:  if they are the weaker, they must be under Love's control, and he is their controller; so that Love, by controlling pleasures and desires, must be eminently temperate.  And observe how in valor\n him; for we hear, not of Love caught by Ares, but of Ares caught by Loveof Aphrodite.  The captor is stronger than the caught; and as he controls what is braver than any other, he must be bravest of all.  So much for justice and temperance and valor in the god:  it remains to speak of skill; and here I must try my best to be adequate.  First, if I in turn may dignify our craft as Eryximachus did his,\nthe god is a composer so accomplished that he is a cause of composing in others:  every one, you know, becomes a poet,  when Love gets hold of him.  This we may fitly take for a testimony that Love is a poet well skilledI speak summarilyin all composing that has to do with music;\nfor whatever we have not or know not we can neither give to another nor teach our neighbor.  And who, let me ask, will gainsay that the composing of all forms of life is Love's own craft, whereby all creatures are begotten and produced?  Again, in artificial manufacture, do we not know that a man who has this god for teacher turns out a brilliant success, whereas he on whom Love has laid no hold is obscure?  If Apollo invented archery and medicine and divination, it was under the guidance of Desire and Love; so that he too may be deemed a disciple of Love as likewise may the\nMuses in music, Hephaestus in metal-work, Athene in weaving and Zeus   Hence also those dealings of the gods were contrived by Loveclearly love of beautyastir in them, for Love has no concern with ugliness; though aforetime, as I began by saying, there were many strange doings among the gods, as legend tells, because of the dominion of Necessity.  But since this god arose, the loving of beautiful things has brought all kinds of benefits both to gods and to men.\nThus I conceive, Phaedrus, that Love was originally of surpassing beauty and goodness, and is latterly the cause of similar excellences in others.  And now I am moved to summon the aid of verse, and tell how it is he who makes\nHe it is who casts alienation out, draws intimacy in; he brings us together in such friendly gatherings as the present; at feasts and dances and oblations he makes himself our leader; politeness contriving, moroseness outdriving; kind giver of amity, giving no enmity; gracious, superb; a marvel to the wise, a delight to the gods coveted of such as share him not, treasured of such as good share have got; father of luxury, tenderness, elegance, graces and longing and yearning; careful of the good, careless of the bad;\nin toil and fear, in drink and discourse, our trustiest helmsman, boatswain, champion, deliverer; ornament of all gods and men; leader fairest and best, whom every one should follow, joining tunefully in the burthen of his song, wherewith he enchants the thought of every god and man.There, Phaedrus, he said, the speech I would offer at his shrine:  I have done my best to mingle amusement with a decent gravity.\nAt the end of Agathon's speech, as Aristodemus told me, there was tumultuous applause from all present, at hearing the youngster speak in terms so appropriate to himself and to the god.  Then Socrates, with a glance at Eryximachus, said:  Son of Acumenus, do you really call it an unfearful fear that has all this while affrighted me, and myself no prophet in saying just now that Agathon would make a marvellous speech, and I be hard put to it?In one part of your statement, that he would speak finely, replied Eryximachus,\nI think you were a true prophet; but as to your being hard put to it, I do not agree.But surely, my good sir, said Socrates, I am bound to be hard put, I or anyone else in the world who should have to speak after such a fine assortment of eloquence.  The greater part of it was not so very astounding; but when we drew towards the close, the beauty of the words and phrases could not but take one's breath away.  For myself, indeed, I was so conscious that I should fail to say anything\nhalf as fine, that for very shame I was on the point of slinking away, had I had any chance.  For his speech so reminded me of Gorgias that I was exactly in the plight described by Homer:  I feared that Agathon in his final phrases would confront me with the eloquent Gorgias' head, and by opposing his speech to mine would turn me thus dumbfounded into stone.  And so in that moment I realized what a ridiculous fool I was to fall in with your proposal that I should take my turn in your eulogies of Love,\nand to call myself an expert in love-matters, when really I was ignorant of the method in which eulogies ought to be made at all.  For I was such a silly wretch as to think that one ought in each case to speak the truth about the person eulogized; on this assumption I hoped we might pick out the fairest of the facts and set these forth in their comeliest guise.  I was quite elated with the notion of what a fine speech I should make, for I felt that I knew the truth.  But now, it appears that this is not what is meant by a good speech of praise;\nwhich is rather an ascription of all the highest and fairest qualities, whether the case be so or not; it is really no matter if they are untrue.  Our arrangement, it seems, was that each should appear to eulogize Love, not that he should make a real eulogy.  Hence it is, sirs, I suppose, that you muster every kind of phrase for your tribute to Love, declaring such and such to be his character and influence, in order to present him\nin the best and fairest light; successfully, of course, before those who do not know him, though it must be otherwise before those who do; your praise has such a fine impressive air!  No, I find I was quite mistaken as to the method required; it was in ignorance that I agreed to take my turn in the round of praising.   did not; so good-bye to my bond.  I am not to be called upon now as an eulogist in your sense; for such I cannot be.\nNevertheless I am ready, if you like, to speak the mere truth in my own way; not to rival your discourses, and so be your laughing-stock.  Decide then, Phaedrus, whether you have any need of such a speech besides, and would like to hear the truth told about Love in whatsoever style of terms and phrases may chance to occur by the way.So Phaedrus and the others bade him speak, just in any manner he himself should think fit.Then allow me further, Phaedrus, to put some little questions to Agathon, so as to secure his agreement before I begin my speech.\nYou have my leave, said Phaedrus; so ask him.  After that, my friend told me, Socrates started off in this sort of way:I must say, my dear Agathon, you gave your speech an excellent introduction, by stating that your duty was first to display the character of Love, and then to treat of his acts.  Those opening words I thoroughly admire.  So come now, complete your beautiful and magnificent description of Love,\nand tell me this:  Are we so to view his character as to take Love to be love of some object, or of none?  My question is not whether he is love of a mother or a fatherhow absurd it would be to ask whether Love is love of mother or father but as though I were asking about our notion of father, whether one's father is a father of somebody or not.  Surely you would say, if you cared to give the proper answer, that the father is father of son or of daughter, would you not?Yes, of course, said Agathon.And you would say the same of the mother?  He agreed to this too.\nThen will you give me just a few more answers, said Socrates, so that you may the better grasp my meaning?  Suppose I were to ask you, Well now, a brother, viewed in the abstract, is he brother of somebody or not?He is, said Agathon.That is, of brother or of sister?  He agreed.Now try and tell me about Love:  is he a love of nothing or of something?\nOf something, to be sure.Now then, said Socrates, keep carefully in mind what is the object of Love, and only tell me whether he desires the particular thing that is his object.Yes, to be sure, he replied.Has he or has he not the object of his desire and love when he desires and loves it?He does not have it, most likely, he said.Not as a likelihood, said Socrates, but as a necessity,\nconsider if the desiring subject must have desire for something it lacks, and again, no desire if it has no lack.  I at least, Agathon, am perfectly sure it is a necessity.  How does it strike you?I am sure of it also, said he.Very good.  Now could a tall man wish to be tall, or a strong man to be strong?By what has been admitted, this is impossible.Since, I suppose, the man in each case would not be lacking the quality mentioned.True.For if, being strong, he should wish to be strong, said Socrates, or being swift, to be swift, or being healthy, to be healthy,since we are apt to suppose in these\nand all such cases that men of this or that sort, possessing these qualities, do also desire what they have already:  I put this in, to prevent any misconception; these men, Agathon, if you consider, are bound to have at the very moment each thing that they have whether they wish it or not; and how, I ask, is a man going to desire that?  No, when a person says, I being healthy, want to be healthy; being rich, I want to be rich; I desire the very things that I havewe shall tell him,\nMy good sir, riches you possess, and health and strength, which you would like to possess in the future also:  for the time now present you have them whether you would or no.  When you say, I desire these present things, we suggest you are merely saying I wish these things now present to be present also in the future.  Would he not admit our point? To this Agathon assented.And so, continued Socrates, a man may be said to love a thing not yet provided or possessed, when he would have the presence of certain things secured to him for ever in the future.Certainly, he said.\nThen such a person, and in general all who feel desire, feel it for what is not provided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack and that sort of thing is the object of desire and love?Assuredly, he said.Now then, said Socrates, let us agree to what we have so far concluded.  First, is not Love directed to certain things of which, in the second place, he has a want?Yes, he said.\nThen, granting this, recollect what things you named in our discussion as the objects of Love:  if you like, I will remind you.  What you said, I believe, was to the effect that the gods contrived the world from a love of beautiful things, for of ugly there was no love.  Did you not say something of the sort?Yes, I did, said Agathon.And quite properly, my friend, said Socrates; then, such being the case, must not Love be only love of beauty, and not of ugliness?  He assented.\nWell then, we have agreed that he loves what he lacks and has not?Yes, he replied.And what Love lacks and has not is beauty?That needs must be, he said.Well now, will you say that what lacks beauty, and in no wise possesses it, is beautiful?Surely not.So can you still allow Love to be beautiful, if this is the case?Whereupon Agathon said, I greatly fear, Socrates, I knew nothing of what I was talking about.\nAh, your words were beautiful enough, Agathon; but pray give me one or two more:  you hold, do you not, that good things are beautiful?I do.Then if Love lacks beautiful things, and good things are beautiful, he must lack good things too.I see no means, Socrates, of contradicting you, he replied; let it be as you say.No, it is Truth, my lovable Agathon,\nwhom you cannot contradict:  Socrates you easily may.And now I shall let you alone, and proceed with the discourse upon Love which I heard one day from a Mantinean woman named Diotima:  in this subject she was skilled, and in many others too; for once, by bidding the Athenians offer sacrifices ten years before the plague, she procured them so much delay in the advent of the sickness.  Well, I also had my lesson from her in love-matters; so now I will try and follow up the points on which Agathon and I have just agreed by narrating to you all on my own account, as well as I am able, the speech she delivered to me.  So first, Agathon, I must unfold,\nin your manner of exposition, who and what sort of being is Love, and then I shall tell of his works.  The readiest way, I think, will be to give my description that form of question and answer which the stranger woman used for hers that day.  For I spoke to her in much the same terms as Agathon addressed just now to me, saying Love was a great god, and was of beautiful things; and she refuted me with the very arguments I have brought against our young friend, showing that by my account that god was neither beautiful nor good.How do you mean, Diotima? said I; is Love then ugly and bad?Peace, for shame! she replied:  or do you imagine that whatever is not beautiful must needs be ugly?\nTo be sure I do.And what is not skilled, ignorant?  Have you not observed that there is something halfway between skill and ignorance?What is that?You know, of course, that to have correct opinion, if you can give no reason for it, is neither full knowledgehow can an unreasoned thing be knowledge?nor yet ignorance; for what hits on the truth cannot be ignorance.  So correct opinion, I take it, is just in that position, between understanding and ignorance.Quite true, I said.\nThen do not compel what is not beautiful to be ugly, she said, or what is not good to be bad.  Likewise of Love, when you find yourself admitting that he is not good nor beautiful, do not therefore suppose he must be ugly and bad, but something betwixt the two.And what of the notion, I asked, to which every one agrees, that he is a great god?Every one?  People who do not know, she rejoined, or those who know also?I mean everybody in the world.\nAt this she laughed and said, But how, Socrates, can those agree that he is a great god who say he is no god at all?What persons are they?  I asked.You are one, she replied, and I am another.How do you make that out?  I said.Easily, said she; tell me, do you not say that all gods are happy and beautiful?  Or will you dare to deny that any god is beautiful and happy?Bless me! I exclaimed, not I.And do you not call those happy who possess good and beautiful things?\nCertainly I do.But you have admitted that Love, from lack of good and beautiful things, desires these very things that he lacks.Yes, I have.How then can he be a god, if he is devoid of things beautiful and good?By no means, it appears.So you see, she said, you are a person who does not consider Love to be a god.What then, I asked, can Love be?  A mortal?Anything but that.\nWell what?As I previously suggested, between a mortal and an immortal.And what is that, Diotima?A great spirit, Socrates:  for the whole of the spiritual is between divine and mortal.Possessing what power?  I asked.Interpreting and transporting human things to the gods and divine things to men; entreaties and sacrifices from below, and ordinances and requitals from above:  being midway between, it makes each to supplement the other, so that the whole is combined in one.  Through it are conveyed all divination and priestcraft concerning sacrifice and ritual\nand incantations, and all soothsaying and sorcery.  God with man does not mingle:  but the spiritual is the means of all society and converse of men with gods and of gods with men, whether waking or asleep.  Whosoever has skill in these affairs is a spiritual man to have it in other matters, as in common arts and crafts, is for the mechanical.  Many and multifarious are these spirits, and one of them is Love.From what father and mother sprung? I asked.\nThat is rather a long story, she replied; but still, I will tell it you.  When Aphrodite was born, the gods made a great feast, and among the company was Resource the son of Cunning.  And when they had banqueted there came Poverty abegging, as well she might in an hour of good cheer, and hung about the door.  Now Resource, grown tipsy with nectarfor wine as yet there was nonewent into the garden of Zeus, and there, overcome with heaviness, slept.  Then Poverty, being of herself so resourceless, devised the scheme of having a child by Resource,\nand lying down by his side she conceived Love.  Hence it is that Love from the beginning has been attendant and minister to Aphrodite, since he was begotten on the day of her birth, and is, moreover, by nature a lover bent on beauty since Aphrodite is beautiful.  Now, as the son of Resource and Poverty, Love is in a peculiar case.  First, he is ever poor, and far from tender or beautiful as most suppose him:\nrather is he hard and parched, shoeless and homeless; on the bare ground always he lies with no bedding, and takes his rest on doorsteps and waysides in the open air; true to his mother's nature, he ever dwells with want.  But he takes after his father in scheming for all that is beautiful and good; for he is brave, strenuous and high-strung, a famous hunter, always weaving some stratagem; desirous and competent of wisdom, throughout life ensuing the truth; a master of jugglery, witchcraft,\nand artful speech.  By birth neither immortal nor mortal, in the selfsame day he is flourishing and alive at the hour when he is abounding in resource; at another he is dying, and then reviving again by force of his father's nature:  yet the resources that he gets will ever be ebbing away; so that Love is at no time either resourceless or wealthy, and furthermore, he stands midway betwixt wisdom and ignorance.  The position is this:  no gods ensue wisdom or desire to be made wise;\nsuch they are already; nor does anyone else that is wise ensue it.  Neither do the ignorant ensue wisdom, nor desire to be made wise:  in this very point is ignorance distressing, when a person who is not comely or worthy or intelligent is satisfied with himself.  The man who does not feel himself defective has no desire for that whereof he feels no defect.Who then, Diotima, I asked, are the followers of wisdom, if they are neither the wise nor the ignorant?\nWhy, a child could tell by this time, she answered, that they are the intermediate sort, and amongst these also is Love.  For wisdom has to do with the fairest things, and Love is a love directed to what is fair; so that Love must needs be a friend of wisdom, and, as such, must be between wise and ignorant.  This again is a result for which he has to thank his origin:  for while he comes of a wise and resourceful father, his mother is unwise and resourceless.  Such, my good Socrates, is the nature of this spirit.  That you should have formed your other notion of Love\nis no surprising accident.  You supposed, if I am to take your own words as evidence, that the beloved and not the lover was Love.  This led you, I fancy, to hold that Love is all-beautiful.  The lovable, indeed, is the truly beautiful, tender, perfect, and heaven-blest; but the lover is of a different type, in accordance with the account I have given.Upon this I observed:  Very well then, madam, you are right; but if Love is such as you describe him, of what use is he to mankind?\nThat is the next question, Socrates, she replied, on which I will try to enlighten you.  While Love is of such nature and origin as I have related, he is also set on beautiful things, as you say.  Now, suppose some one were to ask us:  In what respect is he Love of beautiful things, Socrates and Diotima?  But let me put the question more clearly thus:  What is the love of the lover of beautiful things?That they may be his, I replied.But your answer craves a further query, she said, such as this:  What will he have who gets beautiful things?This question I declared I was quite unable now to answer offhand.\nWell, she proceeded, imagine that the object is changed, and the inquiry is made about the good instead of the beautiful.  Come, Socrates (I shall say), what is the love of the lover of good things?That they may be his, I replied.And what will he have who gets good things?I can make more shift to answer this, I said; he will be happy.\nYes, she said, the happy are happy by acquisition of good things, and we have no more need to ask for what end a man wishes to be happy, when such is his wish:  the answer seems to be ultimate.Quite true, I said.Now do you suppose this wish or this love to be common to all mankind, and that every one always wishes to have good things?  Or what do you say?Even so, I said; it is common to all.\nWell then, Socrates, she said, we do not mean that all men love, when we say that all men love the same things always; we mean that some people love and others do not?I am wondering myself, I replied.But you should not wonder, she said; for we have singled out a certain form of love, and applying thereto the name of the whole, we call it love; and there are other names that we commonly abuse.As, for example  ?  I asked.Take the following:  you know that  is more than a single thing.  For of anything whatever that passes from not being into being the whole cause\nis composing or poetry; so that the productions of all arts are kinds of poetry, and their craftsmen are all poets.That is true.But still, as you are aware, said she, they are not called poets:  they have other names, while a single section disparted from the whole of poetrymerely the business of music and metersis entitled with the name of the whole.  This and no more is called poetry; those only who possess this branch of the art are poets.Quite true, I said.Well, it is just the same with love.  Generically, indeed,\nit is all that desire of good things and of being happyLove most mighty and all-beguiling.  Yet, whereas those who resort to him in various other waysin money-making, an inclination to sports, or philosophyare not described either as loving or as lovers, all those who pursue him seriously in one of his several forms obtain, as loving and as lovers, the name of the whole.I fancy you are right, I said.\nAnd certainly there runs a story, she continued, that all who go seeking their other half are in love; though by my account love is neither for half nor for whole, unless, of course, my dear sir, this happens to be something good.  For men are prepared to have their own feet and hands cut off if they feel these belongings to be harmful.  The fact is, I suppose, that each person does not cherish his belongings except where a man calls the good his own property and the bad another's;\nsince what men love is simply and solely the good.  Or is your view otherwise?Faith, no, I said.Then we may state unreservedly that men love the good?Yes, I said.Well now, must we not extend it to this, that they love the good to be theirs?We must.And do they love it to be not merely theirs but theirs always?Include that also.Briefly then, said she, love loves the good to be one's own for ever.That is the very truth, I said.\nNow if love is always for this, she proceeded, what is the method of those who pursue it, and what is the behavior whose eagerness and straining are to be termed love?  What actually is this effort?  Can you tell me?Ah, Diotima, I said; in that case I should hardly be admiring you and your wisdom, and sitting at your feet to be enlightened on just these questions.Well, I will tell you, said she; it is begetting on a beautiful thing by means of both the body and the soul.It wants some divination to make out what you mean, I said; I do not understand.\nLet me put it more clearly, she said.  All men are pregnant, Socrates, both in body and in soul:  on reaching a certain age our nature yearns to beget.  This it cannot do upon an ugly person, but only on the beautiful:  the conjunction of man and woman is a begetting for both.  It is a divine affair, this engendering and bringing to birth, an immortal element in the creature that is mortal; and it cannot occur in the discordant.\nThe ugly is discordant with whatever is divine, whereas the beautiful is accordant.  Thus Beauty presides over birth as Fate and Lady of Travail; and hence it is that when the pregnant approaches the beautiful it becomes not only gracious but so exhilarate, that it flows over with begetting and bringing forth; though when it meets the ugly it coils itself close in a sullen dismay:  rebuffed and repressed, it brings not forth, but goes in labor with the burden of its young.  Therefore when a person is big and teeming-ripe\nhe feels himself in a sore flutter for the beautiful, because its possessor can relieve him of his heavy pangs.  For you are wrong, Socrates, in supposing that love is of the beautiful.What then is it?It is of engendering and begetting upon the beautiful.Be it so, I said.To be sure it is, she went on; and how of engendering?  Because this is something ever-existent and immortal in our mortal life.\nFrom what has been admitted, we needs must yearn for immortality no less than for good, since love loves good to be one's own for ever.  And hence it necessarily follows that love is of immortality.All this instruction did I get from her at various times when she discoursed of love-matters; and one time she asked me, What do you suppose, Socrates, to be the cause of this love and desire?  For you must have observed the strange state into which all the animals are thrown, whether going on earth or winging the air, when they desire to beget:  they are all sick\nand amorously disposed, first to have union one with another, and next to find food for the new-born; in whose behalf they are ready to fight hard battles, even the weakest against the strongest, and to sacrifice their lives; to be racked with starvation themselves if they can but nurture their young, and be put to any sort of shift.  As for men, said she, one might suppose they do these things on the promptings of reason; but what is the cause\nof this amorous condition in the animals?  Can you tell me?Once more I replied that I did not know; so she proceeded:  How do you design ever to become a master of love-matters, if you can form no notion of this?Why, it is just for this, I tell you, Diotimaas I stated a moment agothat I have come to see you, because I noted my need of an instructor.  Come, tell me the cause of these effects as well as of the others that have relation to love.Well then, she said, if you believe that love is by nature bent on what we have repeatedly admitted, you may cease to wonder.  For here, too, on the same principle as before,\nthe mortal nature ever seeks, as best it can, to be immortal.  In one way only can it succeed, and that is by generation; since so it can always leave behind it a new creature in place of the old.  It is only for a while that each live thing can be described as alive and the same, as a man is said to be the same person from childhood until he is advanced in years:  yet though he is called the same he does not at any time possess the same properties; he is continually becoming a new person, and there are things also which he loses,\nas appears by his hair, his flesh, his bones, and his blood and body altogether.  And observe that not only in his body but in his soul besides we find none of his manners or habits, his opinions, desires, pleasures, pains or fears, ever abiding the same in his particular self; some things grow in him, while others perish.  And here is a yet stranger fact:\nwith regard to the possessions of knowledge, not merely do some of them grow and others perish in us, so that neither in what we know are we ever the same persons; but a like fate attends each single sort of knowledge.  What we call conning implies that our knowledge is departing; since forgetfulness is an egress of knowledge, while conning substitutes a fresh one in place of that which departs, and so preserves our knowledge enough to make it seem the same.  Every mortal thing is preserved in this way; not by keeping it exactly the same for ever,\nlike the divine, but by replacing what goes off or is antiquated with something fresh, in the semblance of the original.  Through this device, Socrates, a mortal thing partakes of immortality, both in its body and in all other respects; by no other means can it be done.  So do not wonder if everything naturally values its own offshoot; since all are beset by this eagerness and this love with a view to immortality.On hearing this argument I wondered, and said:\nReally, can this in truth be so, most wise Diotima?Whereat she, like the professors in their glory:  Be certain of it, Socrates; only glance at the ambition of the men around you, and you will have to wonder at the unreasonableness of what I have told you, unless you are careful to consider how singularly they are affected with the love of winning a name, and laying up fame immortal for all time to come.  For this, even more than for their children, they are ready to run all risks,\nto expend money, perform any kind of task, and sacrifice their lives.  Do you suppose, she asked, that Alcestis would have died for Admetus, or Achilles have sought death on the corpse of Patroclus, or your own Codrus have welcomed it to save the children of his queen, if they had not expected to win a deathless memory for valor, which now we keep?  Of course not.  I hold it is for immortal distinction and\nfor such illustrious renown as this that they all do all they can, and so much the more in proportion to their excellence.  They are in love with what is immortal.  Now those who are teeming in body betake them rather to women, and are amorous on this wise:  by getting children they acquire an immortality, a memorial, and a state of bliss, which in their imagining they for all succeeding time procure.\nBut pregnancy of soulfor there are persons, she declared, who in their souls still more than in their bodies conceive those things which are proper for soul to conceive and bring forth; and what are those things?  Prudence, and virtue in general; and of these the begetters are all the poets and those craftsmen who are styled inventors.  Now by far the highest and fairest part of prudence is that which concerns the regulation of cities and habitations; it is called sobriety\nand justice.  So when a man's soul is so far divine that it is made pregnant with these from his youth, and on attaining manhood immediately desires to bring forth and beget, he too, I imagine, goes about seeking the beautiful object whereon he may do his begetting, since he will never beget upon the ugly.  Hence it is the beautiful rather than the ugly bodies that he welcomes in his pregnancy, and if he chances also on a soul that is fair and noble and well-endowed, he gladly cherishes the two combined in one; and straightway in addressing such a person he is resourceful in discoursing of virtue and of what should be\nthe good man's character and what his pursuits; and so he takes in hand the other's education.  For I hold that by contact with the fair one and by consorting with him he bears and brings forth his long-felt conception, because in presence or absence he remembers his fair.  Equally too with him he shares the nurturing of what is begotten, so that men in this condition enjoy a far fuller community with each other than that which comes with children, and a far surer friendship, since the children of their union are fairer and more deathless.  Every one would choose to have got children such as these rather than the human sort\nmerely from turning a glance upon Homer and Hesiod and all the other good poets, and envying the fine offspring they leave behind to procure them a glory immortally renewed in the memory of men.  Or only look, she said, at the fine children whom Lycurgus left behind him in  to deliver his country andI may almost saythe whole of ; while Solon is highly esteemed among you for begetting his laws; and so are\ndiverse men in diverse other regions, whether among the Greeks or among foreign peoples, for the number of goodly deeds shown forth in them, the manifold virtues they begot.  In their name has many a shrine been reared because of their fine children; whereas for the human sort never any man obtained this honor.Into these love-matters even you, Socrates, might haply be initiated;\nbut I doubt if you could approach the rites and revelations to which these, for the properly instructed, are merely the avenue.  However I will speak of them, she said, and will not stint my best endeavors; only you on your part must try your best to follow.  He who would proceed rightly in this business must not merely begin from his youth to encounter beautiful bodies.  In the first place, indeed, if his conductor guides him aright, he must be in love with one particular body, and engender beautiful converse therein;\nbut next he must remark how the beauty attached to this or that body is cognate to that which is attached to any other, and that if he means to ensue beauty in form, it is gross folly not to regard as one and the same the beauty belonging to all; and so, having grasped this truth, he must make himself a lover of all beautiful bodies, and slacken the stress of his feeling for one by contemning it and counting it a trifle.  But his next advance will be to set a higher value on the beauty of souls than on that of the body, so that however little the grace that may bloom in any likely soul\nit shall suffice him for loving and caring, and for bringing forth and soliciting such converse as will tend to the betterment of the young; and that finally he may be constrained to contemplate the beautiful as appearing in our observances and our laws, and to behold it all bound together in kinship and so estimate the body's beauty as a slight affair.  From observances he should be led on to the branches of knowledge, that there also he may behold a province of beauty, and by looking thus on beauty in the mass may escape from the mean, meticulous slavery of a single instance, where he must center all his care,\nlike a lackey, upon the beauty of a particular child or man or single observance; and turning rather towards the main ocean of the beautiful may by contemplation of this bring forth in all their splendor many fair fruits of discourse and meditation in a plenteous crop of philosophy; until with the strength and increase there acquired he descries a certain single knowledge connected with a beauty which has yet to be told.  And here, I pray you,\nsaid she, give me the very best of your attention.When a man has been thus far tutored in the lore of love, passing from view to view of beautiful things, in the right and regular ascent, suddenly he will have revealed to him, as he draws to the close of his dealings in love, a wondrous vision, beautiful in its nature; and this, Socrates, is the final object of all those previous toils.  First of all, it is ever-existent\nand neither comes to be nor perishes, neither waxes nor wanes; next, it is not beautiful in part and in part ugly, nor is it such at such a time and other at another, nor in one respect beautiful and in another ugly, nor so affected by position as to seem beautiful to some and ugly to others.  Nor again will our initiate find the beautiful presented to him in the guise of a face or of hands or any other portion of the body, nor as a particular description or piece of knowledge, nor as existing somewhere in another substance, such as an animal or\nthe earth or sky or any other thing; but existing ever in singularity of form independent by itself, while all the multitude of beautiful things partake of it in such wise that, though all of them are coming to be and perishing, it grows neither greater nor less, and is affected by nothing.  So when a man by the right method of boy-loving ascends from these particulars and begins to descry that beauty, he is almost able to lay hold of the final secret.  Such is the right approach\nor induction to love-matters.  Beginning from obvious beauties he must for the sake of that highest beauty be ever climbing aloft, as on the rungs of a ladder, from one to two, and from two to all beautiful bodies; from personal beauty he proceeds to beautiful observances, from observance to beautiful learning, and from learning at last to that particular study which is concerned with the beautiful itself and that alone; so that in the end he comes to know\nthe very essence of beauty.  In that state of life above all others, my dear Socrates, said the Mantinean woman, a man finds it truly worth while to live, as he contemplates essential beauty.  This, when once beheld, will outshine your gold and your vesture, your beautiful boys and striplings, whose aspect now so astounds you and makes you and many another, at the sight and constant society of your darlings, ready to do without either food or drink if that were any way possible, and only gaze upon them and have their company.\nBut tell me, what would happen if one of you had the fortune to look upon essential beauty entire, pure and unalloyed; not infected with the flesh and color of humanity, and ever so much more of mortal trash?  What if he could behold the divine beauty itself, in its unique form?\nDo you call it a pitiful life for a man to leadlooking that way, observing that vision by the proper means, and having it ever with him?  Do but consider, she said, that there only will it befall him, as he sees the beautiful through that which makes it visible, to breed not illusions but true examples of virtue, since his contact is not with illusion but with truth.  So when he has begotten a true virtue and has reared it up he is destined to win the friendship of Heaven; he, above all men, is immortal.\nThis, Phaedrus and you others, is what Diotima told me, and I am persuaded of it; in which persuasion I pursue my neighbors, to persuade them in turn that towards this acquisition the best helper that our human nature can hope to find is Love.  Wherefore I tell you now that every man should honor Love, as I myself do honor all love-matters with especial devotion, and exhort all other men to do the same; both now and always do I glorify Love's power and valor\nas far as I am able.  So I ask you, Phaedrus, to be so good as to consider this account as a eulogy bestowed on Love, or else to call it by any name that pleases your fancy.After Socrates had thus spoken, there was applause from all the company except Aristophanes, who was beginning to remark on the allusion which Socrates' speech had made to his own; when suddenly there was a knocking at the outer door, which had a noisy sound like that of revellers, and they heard notes of a flute-girl.  Go and see to it,\nsaid Agathon to the servants; and if it be one of our intimates, invite him in:  otherwise, say we are not drinking, but just about to retire.A few moments after, they heard the voice of Alcibiades in the forecourt, very drunken and bawling loud, to know where Agathon was, and bidding them bring him to Agathon.  So he was brought into the company by the flute-girl and some others of his people supporting him:  he stood at the door,\ncrowned with a bushy wreath of ivy and violets, and wearing a great array of ribands on his head.  Good evening, sirs, he said; will you admit to your drinking a fellow very far gone in liquor, or shall we simply set a wreath on Agathonwhich indeed is what we came forand so away?  I tell you, sir, I was hindered from getting to you yesterday; but now I am here with these ribands on my head, so that I can pull them off mine and twine them about the head of the cleverest, the handsomest, if I may speak thesee, like this!  Ah, you would laugh at me because I am drunk?\nWell, for my part, laugh as you may, I am sure I am speaking the truth.  Come, tell me straight out, am I to enter on the terms stated or not?  Will you take a cup with me or no?At this they all boisterously acclaimed him, bidding him enter and take a seat, and Agathon also invited him.  So he came along with the assistance of his people and while unwinding the ribands for his purpose of wreathing his friend he so held them before his eyes that he failed to notice Socrates, and actually took a seat next to Agathon,\nbetween Socrates and him:  for Socrates had moved up when he caught sight of Alcibiades.  So there he sat, and he saluted Agathon and began to twine his head.Then Agathon said to the servants, Take off Alcibiades' shoes, so that he can recline here with us two.By all means, said Alcibiades; but who is our third at table?  With that he turned about and saw Socrates, and the same moment leapt up and cried, Save us, what a surprise!  Socrates here!  So it was to lie in wait for me again that you were sitting there\nyour old trick of turning up on a sudden where least I expected you!  Well, what are you after now?  Tell me, I say, why you took a seat here and not by Aristophanes or some one else who is absurd and means to be?  Why did you intrigue to get a seat beside the handsomest person in the room?Then Socrates said, Agathon, do your best to protect me, for I have found my love for this fellow no trifling affair.  From the time when I fell in love with him I have not had a moment's liberty\neither to look upon or converse with a single handsome person, but the fellow flies into a spiteful jealousy which makes him treat me in a monstrous fashion, girding at me and hardly keeping his hands to himself.  So take care that he does no mischief now:  pray reconcile us; or if he sets about using force, protect me, for I shudder with alarm at his amorous frenzy.No, said Alcibiades; no reconcilement for you and me.  I will have my revenge on you for this another time:  for the present, Agathon, give me some of your ribands,\nthat I may also deck this person's head, this astonishing head.  He shall not reproach me with having made a garland for you and then, though he conquers every one in discoursenot once in a while, like you the other day, but alwaysbestowing none upon him.  So saying he took some of the ribands and, after decking the head of Socrates, resumed his seat.Reclining there, he proceeded:  Now then, gentlemen, you look sober:  I cannot allow this; you must drink, and fulfil our agreement.  So I appoint as president of this bout, till you have had a reasonable drinkmyself.  Agathon, let the boy bring me as large a goblet as you have.  Ah well, do not trouble, he said; boy, bring me that cooler there,\nfor he saw it would hold a good half-gallon and more.  This he got filled to the brim, and after quaffing it off himself bade them fill up for Socrates, saying, Against Socrates, sirs, my crafty plan is as nought.  However large the bumper you order him, he will quaff it all off and never get tipsy with it.Socrates drank as soon as the boy had filled:  but What procedure is this, Alcibiades?  asked Eryximachus.  Are we to have nothing to say\nor sing over the cup?  Are we going to drink just like any thirsty folk?To this Alcibiades answered:  Ha, Eryximachus, of noblest, soberest sire most noble son; all hail!And the same to you, said Eryximachus:  but what are we to do?Whatever you command, for we are bound to obey you:So prescribe what you please.Then listen, said Eryximachus.  We resolved, before your arrival, that each in order from left to right should make the finest speech he could upon Love,\nand glorify his name.  Now all of us here have spoken; so you, since you have made no speech and have drained the cup, must do your duty and speak.  This done, you shall prescribe what you like for Socrates, and he for his neighbor on the right, and so on with the rest.Very good, Eryximachus, said Alcibiades; but to pit a drunken man against sober tongues is hardly fair.\nBesides, my gifted friend, you are surely not convinced by anything that Socrates has just told you?  You must know the case is quite the contrary of what he was saying.  It is he who, if I praise any god in his presence of any person other than himself, will not keep his hands off me.Come, enough of this, said Socrates.On the honor of a gentleman, said Alcibiades, it is no use your protesting, for I could not praise anyone else in your presence.Well, do that if you like, said Eryximachus; praise Socrates.You mean it? said Alcibiades; you think I had better, Eryximachus?  Am I to set upon the fellow and have my revenge before you all?\nHere, said Socrates; what are you about,to make fun of me with your praises, or what?I shall speak the truth; now, will you permit me?Ah well, so long as it is the truth, I permit you and command you to speak.You shall hear it this moment, said Alcibiades; but there is something you must do.  If I say anything that is false,\nhave the goodness to take me up short and say that there I am lying; for I will not lie if I can help it.  Still, you are not to be surprised if I tell my reminiscences at haphazard; it is anything but easy for a man in my condition to give a fluent and regular enumeration of your oddities.The way I shall take, gentlemen, in my praise of Socrates, is by similitudes.  Probably he will think I do this for derision; but I choose my similitude for the sake of truth, not of ridicule.  For I say\nhe is likest to the Silenus-figures that sit in the statuaries' shops; those, I mean, which our craftsmen make with pipes or flutes in their hands:  when their two halves are pulled open, they are found to contain images of gods.  And I further suggest that he resembles the satyr Marsyas.  Now, as to your likeness, Socrates, to these in figure, I do not suppose even you yourself will dispute it; but I have next to tell you that you are like them in every other respect.  You are a fleering fellow, eh?  If you will not confess it, I have witnesses at hand.  Are you not a piper?\nWhy, yes, and a far more marvellous one than the satyr.  His lips indeed had power to entrance mankind by means of instruments; a thing still possible today for anyone who can pipe his tunes:  for the music of ' flute belonged, I may tell you, to Marsyas his teacher.  So that if anyone, whether a fine flute-player or paltry flute-girl, can but flute his tunes, they have no equal for exciting a ravishment, and will indicate by the divinity that is in them who are apt recipients of the deities and their sanctifications.  You differ from him in one point onlythat you produce the same effect with simple prose unaided by instruments.  For example, when we hear any other person\nquite an excellent orator, perhapspronouncing one of the usual discourses, no one, I venture to say, cares a jot; but so soon as we hear you, or your discourses in the mouth of another,though such person be ever so poor a speaker, and whether the hearer be a woman or a man or a youngsterwe are all astounded and entranced.  As for myself, gentlemen, were it not that I might appear to be absolutely tipsy, I would have affirmed on oath all the strange effects I personally have felt from his words, and still feel even now.  For when I hear him\nI am worse than any wild fanatic; I find my heart leaping and my tears gushing forth at the sound of his speech, and I see great numbers of other people having the same experience.  When I listened to Pericles and other skilled orators I thought them eloquent, but I never felt anything like this; my spirit was not left in a tumult and had not to complain of my being in the condition of a common slave:  whereas the influence of our Marsyas here has often thrown me into such a state\nthat I thought my life not worth living on these terms.  In all this, Socrates, there is nothing that you can call untrue.  Even now I am still conscious that if I consented to lend him my ear, I could not resist him, but would have the same feeling again.  For he compels me to admit that, sorely deficient as I am, I neglect myself while I attend to the affairs of .  So I withhold my ears perforce as from the Sirens, and make off as fast as I can, for fear I should go on sitting beside him till old age was upon me.\nAnd there is one experience I have in presence of this man alone, such as nobody would expect in me; and that is, to be made to feel ashamed; he alone can make me feel it.  For he brings home to me that I cannot disown the duty of doing what he bids me, but that as soon as I turn from his company I fall a victim to the favors of the crowd.  So I take a runaway's leave of him and flee away;\nwhen I see him again I think of those former admissions, and am ashamed.  Often I could wish he had vanished from this world; yet again, should this befall, I am sure I should be more distressed than ever; so I cannot tell what to do with the fellow at all.Such then is the effect that our satyr can work upon me and many another with his piping; but let me tell you how like he is in other respects to the figures of my comparison, and what a wondrous power he wields.  I assure you, not one of you knows him;\nwell, I shall reveal him, now that I have begun.  Observe how Socrates is amorously inclined to handsome persons; with these he is always busy and enraptured.  Again, he is utterly stupid and ignorant, as he affects.  Is not this like a Silenus?  Exactly.  It is an outward casing he wears, similarly to the sculptured Silenus.  But if you opened his inside, you cannot imagine how full he is, good cup-companions, of sobriety.  I tell you, all the beauty a man may have is nothing to him; he despises it\nmore than any of you can believe; nor does wealth attract him, nor any sort of honor that is the envied prize of the crowd.  All these possessions he counts as nothing worth, and all of us as nothing, I assure you; he spends his whole life in chaffing and making game of his fellow-men.  Whether anyone else has caught him in a serious moment and opened him, and seen the images inside, I know not; but I saw them one day, and thought them so\ndivine and golden, so perfectly fair and wondrous, that I simply had to do as Socrates bade me.  And believing he had a serious affection for my youthful bloom, I supposed I had here a godsend and a rare stroke of luck, thinking myself free at any time by gratifying his desires to hear all that our Socrates knew; for I was enormously proud of my youthful charms.  So with this design\nI dismissed the attendant whom till then I invariably brought to my meetings with Socrates, and I would go and meet him alone:  I am to tell you the whole truth; you must all mark my words, and, Socrates, you shall refute me if I lie.  Yes, gentlemen, I went and met him, and the two of us would be alone; and I thought he would seize the chance of talking to me as a lover does to his dear one in private, and I was glad.  But nothing of the sort occurred at all:  he would merely converse with me in his usual manner, and when he had spent the day with me he would leave me and go his way.  After that I proposed he should go with me to the trainer's,\nand I trained with him, expecting to gain my point there.  So he trained and wrestled with me many a time when no one was there.  The same story!  I got no further with the affair.  Then, as I made no progress that way, I resolved to charge full tilt at the man, and not to throw up the contest once I had entered upon it:  I felt I must clear up the situation.  Accordingly I invited him to dine with me, for all the world\nlike a lover scheming to ensnare his favorite.  Even this he was backward to accept; however, he was eventually persuaded.  The first time he came, he wanted to leave as soon as he had dined.  On that occasion I was ashamed and let him go.  The second time I devised a scheme:  when we had dined I went on talking with him far into the night, and when he wanted to go I made a pretext of the lateness of the hour and constrained him to stay.  So he sought repose on the couch next to me, on which he had been sitting at dinner, and no one was sleeping in the room but ourselves.\nNow up to this point my tale could fairly be told to anybody; but from here onwards I would not have continued in your hearing were it not, in the first place, that wine, as the saying goes, whether you couple children with it or no, is truthful; and in the second, I consider it dishonest, when I have started on the praise of Socrates, to hide his deed of lofty disdain.  Besides, I share the plight of the man who was bitten by the snake:  you know it is related of one in such a plight that he refused\n\nto describe his sensations to any but persons who had been bitten themselves, since they alone would understand him and stand up for him if he should give way to wild words and actions in his agony.  Now I have been bitten by a more painful creature, in the most painful way that one can be bitten:  in my heart, or my soul, or whatever one is to call it, I am stricken and stung by his philosophic discourses, which adhere more fiercely than any adder when once they lay hold of a young and not ungifted soul, and force it to do or say whatever they will; I have only to look around me, and there is a Phaedrus, an Agathon, an Eryximachus,\na Pausanias, an Aristodemus, and an AristophanesI need not mention Socrates himselfand all the rest of them; every one of you has had his share of philosophic frenzy and transport, so all of you shall hear.  You shall stand up alike for what then was done and for what now is spoken.  But the domestics, and all else profane and clownish, must clap the heaviest of doors upon their ears.Well, gentlemen, when the lamp had been put out\nand the servants had withdrawn, I determined not to mince matters with him, but to speak out freely what I intended.  So I shook him and said, Socrates, are you asleep?Why, no, he replied.Let me tell you what I have decided.What is the matter?  he asked.I consider, I replied, that you are the only worthy lover I have had, and it looks to me as if you were shy of mentioning it to me.  My position is this:  I count it sheer folly not to gratify you in this as in any other need you may have\nof either my property or that of my friends.  To me nothing is more important than the attainment of the highest possible excellence, and in this aim I believe I can find no abler ally than you.  So I should feel a far worse shame before sensible people for not gratifying such a friend than I should before the senseless multitude for gratifying him.When he heard this, he put on that innocent air which habit has made so characteristic of him, and remarked:  My dear Alcibiades, I daresay you are not really a dolt, if what you say of me is the actual truth,\nand there is a certain power in me that could help you to be better; for then what a stupendous beauty you must see in me, vastly superior to your comeliness!  And if on espying this you are trying for a mutual exchange of beauty for beauty, it is no slight advantage you are counting onyou are trying to get genuine in return for reputed beauties,\nand in fact are designing to fetch off the old bargain of   But be more wary, my gifted friend:  you may be deceived and I may be worthless.  Remember, the intellectual sight begins to be keen when the visual is entering on its wane; but you are a long way yet from that time.To this I answered:  You have heard what I had to say; not a word differed from the feeling in my mind:  it is for you now to consider what you judge to be best for you and me.Ah, there you speak to some purpose, he said:  for in the days that are to come\nwe shall consider and do what appears to be best for the two of us in this and our other affairs.Well, after I had exchanged these words with him and, as it were, let fly my shafts, I fancied he felt the wound:  so up I got, and without suffering the man to say a word more I wrapped my own coat about himit was winter-time; drew myself under his cloak, so;\nwound my arms about this truly spiritual and miraculous creature; and lay thus all the night long.  Here too, Socrates, you are unable to give me the lie.  When I had done all this, he showed such superiority and contempt, laughing my youthful charms to scorn, and flouting the very thing on which I prided myself, gentlemen of the juryfor you are here to try Socrates for his lofty disdain:  you may be sure, by godsand goddessesthat when I arose I had in no more particular sense slept a night\nwith Socrates than if it had been with my father or my elder brother.After that, you can imagine what a state of mind I was in, feeling myself affronted, yet marvelling at the sobriety and integrity of his nature:  for I had lighted on a man such as I never would have dreamt of meetingso sensible and so resolute.  Hence I could find neither a reason for being angry and depriving myself of his society nor a ready means\nof enticing him.  For I was well aware that he was far more proof against money on every side than Ajax against a spear; and in what I thought was my sole means of catching him he had eluded me.  So I was at a loss, and wandered about in the most abject thraldom to this man that ever was known.  Now all this, you know, had already happened to me when we later went on a campaign together to ; and there we were messmates.  Well, first of all, he surpassed not me only but every one else in bearing hardships; whenever we were cut off in some place\nand were compelled, as often in campaigns, to go without food, the rest of us were nowhere in point of endurance.  Then again, when we had plenty of good cheer, he alone could enjoy it to the full, and though unwilling to drink, when once overruled he used to beat us all; and, most surprising of all, no man has ever yet seen Socrates drunk.  Of this power I expect we shall have a good test in a moment.  But it was in his endurance of winter\nin those parts the winters are awfulthat I remember, among his many marvellous feats, how once there came a frost about as awful as can be:  we all preferred not to stir abroad, or if any of us did, we wrapped ourselves up with prodigious care, and after putting on our shoes we muffled up our feet with felt and little fleeces.  But he walked out in that weather, clad in just such a coat as he was always wont to wear, and he made his way more easily over the ice unshod than the rest of us did in our shoes.  The soldiers looked askance at him, thinking that he despised them.\nSo much for that:on service there one day, is well worth hearing.  Immersed in some problem at dawn, he stood in the same spot considering it; and when he found it a tough one, he would not give it up but stood there trying.  The time drew on to midday, and the men began to notice him, and said to one another in wonder:  Socrates has been standing there in a study ever since dawn!  The end of it was that in the evening some of the Ionians after they had supped\nthis time it was summerbrought out their mattresses and rugs and took their sleep in the cool; thus they waited to see if he would go on standing all night too.  He stood till dawn came and the sun rose; then walked away, after offering a prayer to the Sun.Then, if you care to hear of him in battlefor there also he must have his dueon the day of the fight in which I gained my prize for valor from our commanders,\nit was he, out of the whole army, who saved my life:  I was wounded, and he would not forsake me, but helped me to save both my armor and myself.  I lost no time, Socrates, in urging the generals to award the prize for valor to you; and here I think you will neither rebuke me nor give me the lie.  For when the generals, out of regard for my consequence, were inclined to award the prize to me, you outdid them in urging that I should have it rather than you.  And further let me tell you, gentlemen,\nwhat a notable figure he made when the army was retiring in flight from :  I happened to be there on horseback, while he marched under arms.  The troops were in utter disorder, and he was retreating along with Laches, when I chanced to come up with them and, as soon as I saw them, passed them the word to have no fear, saying I would not abandon them.  Here, indeed, I had an even finer view of Socrates than at Potidaeafor personally I had less reason for alarm, as I was mounted; and I noticed, first, how far he outdid Laches in collectedness,\nand next I feltto use a phrase of yours, Aristophaneshow there he stepped along, as his wont is in our streets,  turning a calm sidelong look on friend and foe alike, and convincing anyone even from afar that whoever cares to touch this person will find he can put up a stout enough defence.  The result was that both he and his comrade got away unscathed:  for, as a rule, people will not lay a finger on those\nwho show this disposition in war; it is men flying in headlong rout that they pursue.There are many more quite wonderful things that one could find to praise in Socrates:  but although there would probably be as much to say about any other one of his habits, I select his unlikeness to anybody else, whether in the ancient or in the modern world, as calling for our greatest wonder.  You may take the character of Achilles and see his parallel in Brasidas or others; you may couple\nNestor, Antenor, or others I might mention, with Pericles; and in the same order you may liken most great men; but with the odd qualities of this person, both in himself and in his conversation, you would not come anywhere near finding a comparison if you searched either among men of our day or among those of the past, unless perhaps you borrowed my words and matched him, not with any human being, but with the Silenuses and satyrs, in his person and his speech.For there is a point I omitted when I beganhow his talk most of all resembles the Silenuses\nthat are made to open.  If you chose to listen to Socrates' discourses you would feel them at first to be quite ridiculous; on the outside they are clothed with such absurd words and phrasesall, of course, the gift of a mocking satyr.  His talk is of pack-asses, smiths, cobblers, and tanners, and he seems always to be using the same terms for the same things; so that anyone inexpert and thoughtless might laugh his speeches to scorn.\nBut when these are opened, and you obtain a fresh view of them by getting inside, first of all you will discover that they are the only speeches which have any sense in them; and secondly, that none are so divine, so rich in images of virtue, so largelynay, so completelyintent on all things proper for the study of such as would attain both grace and worth.This, gentlemen, is the praise I give to Socrates:  at the same time, I have seasoned it with a little fault-finding, and have told you his rude behavior towards me.\nHowever, I am not the only person he has treated thus:  there are Charmides, son of Glaucon, Euthydemus, son of Diocles, and any number of others who have found his way of loving so deceitful that he might rather be their favorite than their lover.  I tell you this, Agathon, to save you from his deceit, that by laying our sad experiences to heart you may be on your guard and escape learning by your own pain, like the loon in the adage.\n\nWhen Alcibiades had thus spoken, there was some laughter at his frankness, which showed him still amorously inclined to Socrates; who then remarked:  I believe you are sober, Alcibiades; else you would never have enfolded yourself so charmingly all about, trying to screen from sight your object in all this talk, nor would have put it in as a mere incident at the end.  The true object of all you have said\nwas to stir up a quarrel between me and Agathon:  for you think you must keep me as your undivided lover, and Agathon as the undivided object of your love.  But now you are detected:  your Satyric or Silenic play-scene is all shown up.  Dear Agathon, do not let the plot succeed, but take measures to prevent anyone from setting you and me at odds.\nTo which Agathon replied:  Do you know, Socrates, I fancy you have hit on the truth.  Besides, I take his sitting down between us two as an obvious attempt to draw us apart.  See, he shall not gain his point:  I will come and sit by your side.By all means, said Socrates; here is a place for you beyond me.Good God! said Alcibiades, here's the fellow at me again.  He has set his heart on having the better of me every way.  But at least, you surprising person, do allow Agathon to sit between us.That cannot be, said Socrates:  you have praised me, and so it behoves me to praise my neighbor on the right.  Thus if Agathon sits beyond you, he must surely be praising me again, before receiving his due praises from me.  So let him be, my good soul, and\ndo not grudge the lad those praises of mine:  for I am most eager to pronounce his eulogy.Ha, ha!  Alcibiades, said Agathon; there can be no question of my staying here:  I shall jump up and at once, if that will make Socrates praise me.There you are, said Alcibiades; just as usual:  when Socrates is present, nobody else has a chance with the handsome ones.  You see how resourceful he was in devising a plausible reason why our young friend should sit beside him.\nSo Agathon was getting up in order to seat himself by Socrates, when suddenly a great crowd of revellers arrived at the door, which they found just opened for some one who was going out.  They marched straight into the party and seated themselves:  the whole place was in an uproar and, losing all order, they were forced to drink a vast amount of wine.  Then, as Aristodemus related, Eryximachus, Phaedrus, and some others took their leave and departed;\nwhile he himself fell asleep, and slumbered a great while, for the nights were long.  He awoke towards dawn, as the cocks were crowing; and immediately he saw that all the company were either sleeping or gone, except Agathon, Aristophanes, and Socrates, who alone remained awake and were drinking out of a large vessel, from left to right; and Socrates was arguing with them.  As to most of the talk, Aristodemus had no recollection,\nfor he had missed the beginning and was also rather drowsy; but the substance of it was, he said, that Socrates was driving them to the admission that the same man could have the knowledge required for writing comedy and tragedythat the fully skilled tragedian could be a comedian as well.  While they were being driven to this, and were but feebly following it, they began to nod; first Aristophanes dropped into a slumber, and then, as day began to dawn, Agathon also.

You know what my condition is, and you have heard how I think it is to our advantage to arrange these matters. \nAnd I claim that I ought not to be refused what I ask because I am not your lover.  For lovers repent of the kindnesses they have done when their passion ceases;  but there is no time when non-lovers naturally repent.  For they do kindnesses to the best of their ability, not under compulsion, but of their free will, according to their view of their own best interest.  And besides, lovers consider the injury they have done to their own concerns on account of their love, and the benefits they have conferred, and they add the trouble they have had,\nand so they think they have long ago made sufficient return to the beloved;  but non-lovers cannot ever neglect of their own affairs because of their condition, nor can they take account of the pains they have been at in the past, nor lay any blame for quarrels with their relatives;  and so, since all these evils are removed, there is nothing left for them but to do eagerly what they think will please the beloved. \nAnd besides, if lovers ought to be highly esteemed because they say they have the greatest love for the objects of their passion, since both by word and deed they are ready to make themselves hated by others to please the beloved, it is easy to see that, if what they say is true, whenever they fall in love afterwards, they will care for the new love more than for the old and will certainly injure the old love, if that pleases the new.  And how can one reasonably entrust matters of such importance to one who is afflicted with a disease\nsuch that no one of any experience would even try to cure it?  For they themselves confess that they are insane, rather than in their right mind, and that they know they are foolish, but cannot control themselves;  and so, how could they, when they have come to their senses, think those acts were good which they determined upon when in such a condition?  And if you were to choose the best from among your lovers, your choice would be limited to a few;  whereas it would be made from a great number, if you chose the most congenial from non-lovers,\nso that you would have a better chance, in choosing among many, of finding the one most worthy of your affection. Now if you are afraid of public opinion, and fear that if people find out your love affair you will be disgraced,\nconsider that lovers, believing that others would be as envious of them as they are of others, are likely to be excited by possession and in their pride to show everybody that they have not toiled in vain;  but the non-lovers, since they have control of their feelings, are likely to choose what is really best, rather than to court the opinion of mankind.  Moreover, many are sure to notice and see the lovers going about with their beloved ones and making that\ntheir chief business, and so, when they are seen talking with each other, people think they are met in connection with some love-matter either past or future;  but no one ever thinks of finding fault with non-lovers because they meet, since everyone knows that one must converse with somebody, either because of friendship or because it is pleasant for some other reason.  And then, too, if you are frightened by the thought that it is hard for friendship to last, and that under other circumstances any quarrel would be an equal misfortune to both, but that when you have surrendered\nwhat you prize most highly you would be the chief sufferer, it would be reasonable for you to be more afraid of the lovers;  for they are pained by many things and they think everything that happens is done for the sake of hurting them.  Therefore they prevent their loves from associating with other men, for they fear the wealthy, lest their money give them an advantage, and the educated, lest they prove superior in intellect;  and they are on their guard\nagainst the influence of everyone who possesses any other good thing.  If now they persuade you to incur the dislike of all these, they involve you in a dearth of friends, and if you consider your own interest and are more sensible than they, you will have to quarrel with them.  But those who are not in love, but who have gained the satisfaction of their desires because of their merit, would not be jealous of those who associated with you, but would hate those who did not wish to do so, thinking that you are slighted by these last and benefited by the former,\nso that there is much more likelihood that they will gain friendship than enmity from their love-affair with you. And then, too, many lovers are moved by physical passion before they know the character or have become acquainted with the connections of the beloved, so that it is uncertain whether they will wish to be your friends\nafter their passion has ceased.  But in the case of those who are not in love, who were your friends before entering into the closer relation, the favors received are not likely to make the friendship less, but will remain as pledges of future joys.  And then, too, it will be better for your character to yield to me than to a lover.  For lovers praise your words and acts beyond due measure, partly through fear of incurring your displeasure,\nand partly because their own judgment is obscured by their passion.  For such are the exhibitions of the power of Love:  he makes the unsuccessful lovers think that things are grievous which cause no pain to others, and he compels the successful to praise what ought not to give pleasure;  therefore those whom they love are more to be pitied than envied.  But if you yield to me, I shall consort with you, not with a view to present pleasure only, but to\nfuture advantage also, not being overcome by passion but in full control of myself, and not taking up violent enmity because of small matters, but slowly gathering little anger when the transgressions are great, forgiving involuntary wrongs and trying to prevent intentional ones;  for these are the proofs of a friendship that will endure for a long time.  But if you have a notion that friendship cannot be firm,\nunless one is in love, you should bear in mind that in that case we should not have great affection for sons or for fathers and mothers, nor should we possess faithful friends who have been gained not through passion but through associations of a different kind. Besides, if you ought to grant favors to those who ask for them most eagerly, you ought in other matters also to confer benefits, not on the best, but on the most needy;  for they will be most grateful, since they are relieved of the greatest ills.  And then, too,\nat private entertainments you ought not to invite your friends, but beggars and those who need a meal;  for they will love you and attend you and come to your doors and be most pleased and grateful, and will call down many blessings upon your head.  Perhaps, however, you ought not to grant favors to those who beg for them, but to those who are most able to repay you;  and not to those who ask merely, but to the most deserving;  and not to those\nwho will enjoy your youthful beauty, but to those who will share their good things with you when you are older;  and not to those who, when they have succeeded, will boast to others of their success, but to those who will modestly keep it a secret from all;  and not to those who will be enamored for a little while, but to those who will be your friends for life;  and not to those who will seek a pretext for a quarrel when their passion has died out, but\nto those who will show their own merit when your youth is passed.  Do you, then, remember what I have said, and bear this also in mind, that lovers are admonished by their friends, who think their way of life is bad, but no relative ever blamed a non-lover for bad management of his own interests on account of that condition. Perhaps you may ask me if I advise you to grant favors to all non-lovers.  But I think the lover would not urge you to be so disposed\ntoward all lovers either;  for the favor, if scattered broadcast, is not so highly prized by the rational recipient, nor can you, if you wish, keep your relations with one hidden from the rest.  But from love no harm ought to come, but benefit to both parties.  Now I think I have said enough.  But if you feel any lack, or think anything has been omitted, ask questions.

Now there was once upon a time a boy, or rather a stripling, of great beauty:  and he had many lovers.  And among these was one of peculiar craftiness, who was as much in love with the boy as anyone, but had made him believe that he was not in love;  and once in wooing him, he tried to persuade him of this very thing, that favors ought to be granted rather to the non-lover than to the lover;  and his words were as follows: There is only one way, dear boy, for those to begin who\nare to take counsel wisely about anything.  One must know what the counsel is about, or it is sure to be utterly futile, but most people are ignorant of the fact that they do not know the nature of things.  So, supposing that they do know it, they come to no agreement in the beginning of their enquiry, and as they go on they reach the natural result,they agree neither with themselves nor with each other.  Now you and I must not fall into the error which we condemn in others, but, since we are to discuss the question, whether the lover or the non-lover is to be preferred let us first agree on a definition of love, its nature and its power,\nand then, keeping this definition in view and making constant reference to it, let us enquire whether love brings advantage or harm.  Now everyone sees that love is a desire;  and we know too that non-lovers also desire the beautiful.  How then are we to distinguish the lover from the non-lover?  We must observe that in each one of us there are two ruling and leading principles, which we follow whithersoever they lead;  one is the innate desire for pleasures, the other an acquired opinion\nwhich strives for the best.  These two sometimes agree within us and are sometimes in strife;  and sometimes one, and sometimes the other has the greater power.  Now when opinion leads through reason toward the best and is more powerful,\nits power is called self-restraint, but when desire irrationally drags us toward pleasures and rules within us, its rule is called excess.  Now excess has many names, for it has many members and many forms;  and whichever of these forms is most marked gives its own name, neither beautiful nor honorable, to him who possesses it.  For example, if the desire for food prevails over the higher reason\nand the other desires, it is called gluttony, and he who possesses it will be called by the corresponding name of glutton, and again, if the desire for drink becomes the tyrant and leads him who possesses it toward drink, we know what he is called;  and it is quite clear what fitting names of the same sort will be given when any desire akin to these acquires the rule.  The reason for what I have said hitherto is pretty clear by this time, but everything is plainer when spoken than when unspoken;  so I say that the desire which overcomes the rational opinion\nthat strives toward the right, and which is led away toward the enjoyment of beauty and again is strongly forced by the desires that are kindred to itself toward personal beauty, when it gains the victory, takes its name from that very force, and is called love.

That, however, is in the hands of God;  we must return to our boy. Well then, my dearest, what the subject is, about which we are to take counsel, has been said and defined, and now let us continue, keeping our attention fixed\nupon that definition, and tell what advantage or harm will naturally come from the lover or the non-lover to him who grants them his favors. He who is ruled by desire and is a slave to pleasure will inevitably desire to make his beloved as pleasing to himself as possible.  Now to one who is of unsound mind everything is pleasant which does not oppose him, but everything that is better or equal is hateful. \nSo the lover will not, if he can help it, endure a beloved who is better than himself or his equal, but always makes him weaker and inferior;  but the ignorant is inferior to the wise, the coward to the brave, the poor speaker to the eloquent, the slow of wit to the clever.  Such mental defects, and still greater than these, in the beloved will necessarily please the lover, if they are implanted by Nature, and if they are not, he must implant them or be deprived of his immediate enjoyment. \nAnd he is of necessity jealous and will do him great harm by keeping him from many advantageous associations, which would most tend to make a man of him, especially from that which would do most to make him wise.  This is divine philosophy, and from it the lover will certainly keep his beloved away, through fear of being despised;  and he will contrive to keep him ignorant of everything else and make him look to his lover for everything, so that he will be most agreeable to him\nand most harmful to himself.  In respect to the intellect, then, a man in love is by no means a profitable guardian or associate. We must next consider how he who is forced to follow pleasure and not good will keep the body of him whose master he is, and what care he will give to it.  He will plainly court a beloved who is effeminate, not virile, not brought up in the pure sunshine, but in mingled shade, unused to manly toils and the sweat of exertion, but accustomed to a delicate and\nunmanly mode of life, adorned with a bright complexion of artificial origin, since he has none by nature, and in general living a life such as all this indicates, which it is certainly not worth while to describe further.  We can sum it all up briefly and pass on.  A person with such a body, in war and in all important crises, gives courage to his enemies, and fills his friends, and even his lovers themselves, with fear. This may be passed over as self-evident, but the next question,\nwhat advantage or harm the intercourse and guardianship of the lover will bring to his beloved in the matter of his property, must be discussed.  Now it is clear to everyone, and especially to the lover, that he would desire above all things to have his beloved bereft of the dearest and kindest and holiest possessions;  for he would wish him to be deprived of father, mother, relatives and friends,\nthinking that they would hinder and censure his most sweet intercourse with him.  But he will also think that one who has property in money or other possessions will be less easy to catch and when caught will be less manageable;  wherefore the lover must necessarily begrudge his beloved the possession of property and rejoice at its loss.  Moreover the lover would wish his beloved to be as long as possible unmarried, childless, and homeless, since he wishes to enjoy as long as possible what is pleasant to himself. Now there are also other evils, but God\nhas mingled with most of them some temporary pleasure;  so, for instance, a flatterer is a horrid creature and does great harm, yet Nature has combined with him a kind of pleasure that is not without charm, and one might find fault with a courtesan as an injurious thing, and there are many other such creatures and practices which are yet for the time being very pleasant;  but a lover is not only harmful to his beloved\nbut extremely disagreeable to live with as well.  The old proverb says, birds of a feather flock together;  that is, I suppose, equality of age leads them to similar pleasures and through similarity begets friendship;  and yet even they grow tired of each other's society.  Now compulsion of every kind is said to be oppressive to every one, and the lover not only is unlike his beloved, but he exercises the strongest compulsion.  For he is old while his love is young, and he does not leave him day or night,\nif he can help it, but is driven by the sting of necessity, which urges him on, always giving him pleasure in seeing, hearing, touching, and by all his senses perceiving his beloved, so that he is glad to serve him constantly.  But what consolation or what pleasure can he give the beloved?  Must not this protracted intercourse bring him to the uttermost disgust, as he looks at the old, unlovely face, and other things to match, which\nit is not pleasant even to hear about, to say nothing of being constantly compelled to come into contact with them?  And he is suspiciously guarded in all ways against everybody, and has to listen to untimely and exaggerated praises and to reproaches which are unendurable when the man is sober, and when he is in his cups and indulges in wearisome and unrestrained freedom of speech become not only unendurable but disgusting. And while he is in love he is harmful and disagreeable, but when his love has ceased he is thereafter false to him whom he formerly hardly induced\nto endure his wearisome companionship through the hope of future benefits by making promises with many prayers and oaths.  But now that the time of payment has come he has a new ruler and governor within him, sense and reason in place of love and madness, and has become a different person;  but of this his beloved knows nothing.  He asks of him a return for former favors, reminding him of past sayings and doings, as if he were speaking to the same man;  but the lover is ashamed to say that he has changed, and yet he cannot keep the oaths and promises he made\nwhen he was ruled by his former folly:  now that he has regained his reason and come to his senses, lest by doing what he formerly did he become again what he was.  He runs away from these things, and the former lover is compelled to become a defaulter.  The shell has fallen with the other side up; and he changes his part and runs away;  and the other is forced to run after him in anger and with imprecations, he who did not know at the start that he ought never to have accepted a lover\nwho was necessarily without reason, but rather a reasonable non-lover;  for otherwise he would have to surrender himself to one who was faithless, irritable, jealous, and disagreeable, harmful to his property, harmful to his physical condition, and most harmful by far to the cultivation of his soul, than which there neither is nor ever will be anything of higher importance in truth either in heaven or on earth.  These things, dear boy, you must bear in mind, and you must know that the fondness of the lover is not a matter of goodwill, but of appetite which he wishes to satisfy: \nJust as the wolf loves the lamb, so the lover adores his beloved.

And I must say that this saying is not true, which teaches that when a lover is at hand the non-lover should be more favored, because the lover is insane, and the other sane.  For if it were a simple fact that insanity is an evil, the saying would be true;  but in reality the greatest of blessings come to us through madness, when it is sent as a gift of the gods.  For the prophetess at \nand the priestesses at  when they have been mad have conferred many splendid benefits upon  both in private and in public affairs, but few or none when they have been in their right minds;  and if we should speak of the Sibyl and all the others who by prophetic inspiration have foretold many things to many persons and thereby made them fortunate afterwards, anyone can see that we should speak a long time.  And it is worth while to adduce also the fact that those men of old who invented names thought that madness was neither shameful nor disgraceful; \notherwise they would not have connected the very word mania with the noblest of arts, that which foretells the future, by calling it the manic art.  No, they gave this name thinking that mania, when it comes by gift of the gods, is a noble thing, but nowadays people call prophecy the mantic art, tastelessly inserting a T in the word.  So also, when they gave a name to the investigation of the future which rational persons conduct through observation of birds and by other signs, since they furnish mind (nous)\nand information (historia) to human thought (oiesis) from the intellect (dianoia) they called it the oionoistic (oionoistike) art, which modern folk now call oionistic making it more high-sounding by introducing the long O.  The ancients, then testify that in proportion as prophecy (mantike) is superior to augury, both in name and in fact, in the same proportion madness, which comes from god, is superior to sanity, which is of human origin.  Moreover, when diseases and the greatest troubles have been visited upon certain families through some ancient guilt, madness\nhas entered in and by oracular power has found a way of release for those in need, taking refuge in prayers and the service of the gods, and so, by purifications and sacred rites, he who has this madness is made safe for the present and the after time, and for him who is rightly possessed of madness a release from present\nills is found.  And a third kind of possession and madness comes from the Muses.  This takes hold upon a gentle and pure soul, arouses it and inspires it to songs and other poetry, and thus by adorning countless deeds of the ancients educates later generations.  But he who without the divine madness comes to the doors of the Muses, confident that he will be a good poet by art, meets with no success, and the poetry of the sane man vanishes into nothingness before that of the inspired madmen.\n All these noble results of inspired madness I can mention, and many more.  Therefore let us not be afraid on that point, and let no one disturb and frighten us by saying that the reasonable friend should be preferred to him who is in a frenzy.  Let him show in addition that love is not sent from heaven for the advantage of lover and beloved alike, and we will grant him the prize of victory.  We, on our part, must prove that such madness\nis given by the gods for our greatest happiness;  and our proof will not be believed by the merely clever, but will be accepted by the truly wise.  First, then, we must learn the truth about the soul divine and human by observing how it acts and is acted upon.  And the beginning of our proof is as follows: Every soul is immortal.  For that which is ever moving is immortal but that which moves something else or is moved by something else, when it ceases to move, ceases to live.  Only that which moves itself, since it does not leave itself, never ceases to move, and this is also\nthe source and beginning of motion for all other things which have motion.  But the beginning is ungenerated.  For everything that is generated must be generated from a beginning, but the beginning is not generated from anything;  for if the beginning were generated from anything, it would not be generated from a beginning.  And since it is ungenerated, it must be also indestructible;  for if the beginning were destroyed, it could never be generated from anything nor anything else from it, since all things must be generated from a beginning.  Thus that which moves itself must be the beginning of motion.  And this can be neither destroyed nor generated,\notherwise all the heavens and all generation must fall in ruin and stop and never again have any source of motion or origin.  But since that which is moved by itself has been seen to be immortal, one who says that this self-motion is the essence and the very idea of the soul, will not be disgraced.  For every body which derives motion from without is soulless, but that which has its motion within itself has a soul, since that is the nature of the soul;  but if this is true,\nthat that which moves itself is nothing else than the soul,then the soul would necessarily be ungenerated and immortal. Concerning the immortality of the soul this is enough;  but about its form we must speak in the following manner.  To tell what it really is would be a matter for utterly superhuman and long discourse, but it is within human power to describe it briefly in a figure;  let us therefore speak in that way.  We will liken the soul to the composite nature of a pair of winged horses and a charioteer.  Now the horses and charioteers of the gods are all good and\nof good descent, but those of other races are mixed;  and first the charioteer of the human soul drives a pair, and secondly one of the horses is noble and of noble breed, but the other quite the opposite in breed and character.  Therefore in our case the driving is necessarily difficult and troublesome.  Now we must try to tell why a living being is called mortal or immortal.  Soul, considered collectively, has the care of all that which is soulless, and it traverses the whole heaven, appearing sometimes in one form and sometimes in another;  now when it is perfect\nand fully winged, it mounts upward and governs the whole world;  but the soul which has lost its wings is borne along until it gets hold of something solid, when it settles down, taking upon itself an earthly body, which seems to be self-moving, because of the power of the soul within it;  and the whole, compounded of soul and body, is called a living being, and is further designated as mortal.  It is not immortal by any reasonable supposition, but we, though we have never seen\nor rightly conceived a god, imagine an immortal being which has both a soul and a body which are united for all time.  Let that, however, and our words concerning it, be as is pleasing to God;  we will now consider the reason why the soul loses its wings.  It is something like this. The natural function of the wing is to soar upwards and carry that which is heavy up to the place where dwells the race of the gods.  More than any other thing that pertains to the body\nit partakes of the nature of the divine.  But the divine is beauty, wisdom, goodness, and all such qualities;  by these then the wings of the soul are nourished and grow, but by the opposite qualities, such as vileness and evil, they are wasted away and destroyed.  Now the great leader in heaven, Zeus, driving a winged chariot, goes first, arranging all things and caring for all things. \nHe is followed by an army of gods and spirits, arrayed in eleven squadrons;  Hestia alone remains in the house of the gods.  Of the rest, those who are included among the twelve great gods and are accounted leaders, are assigned each to his place in the army.  There are many blessed sights and many ways hither and thither within the heaven, along which the blessed gods go to and fro attending each to his own duties;  and whoever wishes, and is able, follows, for jealousy is excluded from the celestial band.  But when they go to a feast and a banquet,\nthey proceed steeply upward to the top of the vault of heaven, where the chariots of the gods, whose well matched horses obey the rein, advance easily, but the others with difficulty;  for the horse of evil nature weighs the chariot down, making it heavy and pulling toward the earth the charioteer whose horse is not well trained.  There the utmost toil and struggle await the soul.  For those that are called immortal, when they reach the top,\npass outside and take their place on the outer surface of the heaven, and when they have taken their stand, the revolution carries them round and they behold the things outside of the heaven. But the region above the heaven was never worthily sung by any earthly poet, nor will it ever be.  It is, however, as I shall tell;  for I must dare to speak the truth, especially as truth is my theme.  For the colorless, formless, and intangible truly existing essence, with which all true knowledge is concerned, holds this region\nand is visible only to the mind, the pilot of the soul.  Now the divine intelligence, since it is nurtured on mind and pure knowledge, and the intelligence of every soul which is capable of receiving that which befits it, rejoices in seeing reality for a space of time and by gazing upon truth is nourished and made happy until the revolution brings it again to the same place.  In the revolution it beholds absolute justice, temperance, and knowledge, not such knowledge as has a beginning and varies as it is associated with one\nor another of the things we call realities, but that which abides in the real eternal absolute;  and in the same way it beholds and feeds upon the other eternal verities, after which, passing down again within the heaven, it goes home, and there the charioteer puts up the horses at the manger and feeds them with ambrosia and then gives them nectar to drink. Such is the life of the gods;  but of the other souls,\nthat which best follows after God and is most like him, raises the head of the charioteer up into the outer region and is carried round in the revolution, troubled by the horses and hardly beholding the realities;  and another sometimes rises and sometimes sinks, and, because its horses are unruly, it sees some things and fails to see others.  The other souls follow after, all yearning for the upper region but unable to reach it, and are carried round beneath,\ntrampling upon and colliding with one another, each striving to pass its neighbor.  So there is the greatest confusion and sweat of rivalry, wherein many are lamed, and many wings are broken through the incompetence of the drivers;  and after much toil they all go away without gaining a view of reality, and when they have gone away they feed upon opinion.  But the reason of the great eagerness to see where the plain of truth is, lies in the fact that the fitting pasturage for the best part of the soul is in the meadow there, and the wing\non which the soul is raised up is nourished by this.  And this is a law of Destiny, that the soul which follows after God and obtains a view of any of the truths is free from harm until the next period, and if it can always attain this, is always unharmed;  but when, through inability to follow, it fails to see, and through some mischance is filled with forgetfulness and evil and grows heavy, and when it has grown heavy, loses its wings and falls to the earth, then it is the law that this soul\nshall never pass into any beast at its first birth, but the soul that has seen the most shall enter into the birth of a man who is to be a philosopher or a lover of beauty, or one of a musical or loving nature, and the second soul into that of a lawful king or a warlike ruler, and the third into that of a politician or a man of business or a financier, the fourth into that of a hardworking gymnast or one who will be concerned with the cure of the body, and the fifth\nwill lead the life of a prophet or some one who conducts mystic rites;  to the sixth, a poet or some other imitative artist will be united, to the seventh, a craftsman or a husbandman, to the eighth, a sophist or a demagogue, to the ninth, a tyrant.  Now in all these states, whoever lives justly obtains a better lot, and whoever lives unjustly, a worse.  For each soul returns to the place whence it came in ten thousand years;  for it does not\nregain its wings before that time has elapsed, except the soul of him who has been a guileless philosopher or a philosophical lover;  these, when for three successive periods of a thousand years they have chosen such a life, after the third period of a thousand years become winged in the three thousandth year and go their way;  but the rest, when they have finished their first life, receive judgment, and after the judgment some go to the places of correction under the earth and pay their penalty, while the others,\nmade light and raised up into a heavenly place by justice, live in a manner worthy of the life they led in human form.  But in the thousandth year both come to draw lots and choose their second life, each choosing whatever it wishes.  Then a human soul may pass into the life of a beast, and a soul which was once human, may pass again from a beast into a man.  For the soul which has never seen the truth can never pass into human form.  For a human being must understand a general conception formed by collecting into a unity\nby means of reason the many perceptions of the senses;  and this is a recollection of those things which our soul once beheld, when it journeyed with God and, lifting its vision above the things which we now say exist, rose up into real being.  And therefore it is just that the mind of the philosopher only has wings, for he is always, so far as he is able, in communion through memory with those things the communion with which causes God to be divine.  Now a man who employs such memories rightly is always being initiated into perfect mysteries and he alone becomes truly perfect; \nbut since he separates himself from human interests and turns his attention toward the divine, he is rebuked by the vulgar, who consider him mad and do not know that he is inspired. All my discourse so far has been about the fourth kind of madness, which causes him to be regarded as mad, who, when he sees the beauty on earth, remembering the true beauty, feels his wings growing and longs to stretch them for an upward flight, but cannot do so, and, like a bird, gazes upward and neglects the things below. \nMy discourse has shown that this is, of all inspirations, the best and of the highest origin to him who has it or who shares in it, and that he who loves the beautiful, partaking in this madness, is called a lover.  For, as has been said, every soul of man has by the law of nature beheld the realities, otherwise it would not have entered\ninto a human being, but it is not easy for all souls to gain from earthly things a recollection of those realities, either for those which had but a brief view of them at that earlier time, or for those which, after falling to earth, were so unfortunate as to be turned toward unrighteousness through some evil communications and to have forgotten the holy sights they once saw.  Few then are left which retain an adequate recollection of them;  but these when they see here any likeness of the things of that other world, are stricken with amazement and can no longer control themselves;  but they do not understand their condition, because they do not clearly perceive. \nNow in the earthly copies of justice and temperance and the other ideas which are precious to souls there is no light, but only a few, approaching the images through the darkling organs of sense, behold in them the nature of that which they imitate, and these few do this with difficulty.  But at that former time they saw beauty shining in brightness, when, with a blessed companywe following in the train of Zeus, and others in that of some other godthey saw the blessed sight and vision and were initiated into that which is rightly called\nthe most blessed of mysteries, which we celebrated in a state of perfection, when we were without experience of the evils which awaited us in the time to come, being permitted as initiates to the sight of perfect and simple and calm and happy apparitions, which we saw in the pure light, being ourselves pure and not entombed in this which we carry about with us and call the body, in which we are imprisoned like an oyster in its shell. So much, then, in honor of memory, on account of which I have now spoken at some length, through yearning for the joys of that other time.  But beauty,\nas I said before, shone in brilliance among those visions;  and since we came to earth we have found it shining most clearly through the clearest of our senses;  for sight is the sharpest of the physical senses, though wisdom is not seen by it, for wisdom would arouse terrible love, if such a clear image of it were granted as would come through sight, and the same is true of the other lovely realities;  but beauty alone has this privilege, and therefore it is most clearly seen\nand loveliest.  Now he who is not newly initiated, or has been corrupted, does not quickly rise from this world to that other world and to absolute beauty when he sees its namesake here, and so he does not revere it when he looks upon it, but gives himself up to pleasure and like a beast proceeds to lust and begetting; \nhe makes licence his companion and is not afraid or ashamed to pursue pleasure in violation of nature.  But he who is newly initiated, who beheld many of those realities, when he sees a godlike face or form which is a good image of beauty, shudders at first, and something of the old awe comes over him, then, as he gazes, he reveres the beautiful one as a god, and if he did not fear to be thought stark mad, he would offer sacrifice to his beloved as to an idol or a god.  And as he looks upon him, a reaction from his shuddering comes over him, with sweat and unwonted heat; \nfor as the effluence of beauty enters him through the eyes, he is warmed;  the effluence moistens the germ of the feathers, and as he grows warm, the parts from which the feathers grow, which were before hard and choked, and prevented the feathers from sprouting, become soft, and as the nourishment streams upon him, the quills of the feathers swell and begin to grow from the roots over all the form of the soul;  for it was once all feathered. Now in this process the whole soul throbs and palpitates, and\nas in those who are cutting teeth there is an irritation and discomfort in the gums, when the teeth begin to grow, just so the soul suffers when the growth of the feathers begins;  it is feverish and is uncomfortable and itches when they begin to grow.  Then when it gazes upon the beauty of the boy and receives the particles which flow thence to it (for which reason they are called yearning), it is moistened and warmed,\nceases from its pain and is filled with joy;  but when it is alone and grows dry, the mouths of the passages in which the feathers begin to grow become dry and close up, shutting in the sprouting feathers, and the sprouts within, shut in with the yearning, throb like pulsing arteries, and each sprout pricks the passage in which it is, so that the whole soul, stung in every part, rages with pain;  and then again, remembering the beautiful one, it rejoices.  So, because of these two mingled sensations,\nit is greatly troubled by its strange condition;  it is perplexed and maddened, and in its madness it cannot sleep at night or stay in any one place by day, but it is filled with longing and hastens wherever it hopes to see the beautiful one.  And when it sees him and is bathed with the waters of yearning, the passages that were sealed are opened, the soul has respite from the stings and is eased of its pain, and this pleasure\nwhich it enjoys is the sweetest of pleasures at the time.  Therefore the soul will not, if it can help it, be left alone by the beautiful one, but esteems him above all others, forgets for him mother and brothers and all friends, neglects property and cares not for its loss, and despising all the customs and proprieties in which it formerly took pride, it is ready to be a slave and to sleep wherever it is allowed, as near as possible to the beloved;  for it not only reveres him who possesses beauty,\nbut finds in him the only healer of its greatest woes.  Now this condition, fair boy, about which I am speaking, is called Love by men, but when you hear what the gods call it, perhaps because of your youth you will laugh.  But some of the Homeridae, I believe, repeat two verses on Love from the spurious poems of Homer, one of which is very outrageous and not perfectly metrical.  They sing them as follows:\nYou may believe this, or not;  but the condition of lovers and the cause of it are just as I have said. Now he who is a follower of Zeus, when seized by love can bear a heavier burden of the winged god;  but those who are servants of Ares and followed in his train, when they have been seized by Love and think they have been wronged in any way by the beloved, become murderous and are ready to sacrifice themselves and the beloved. \nAnd so it is with the follower of each of the other gods;  he lives, so far as he is able, honoring and imitating that god, so long as he is uncorrupted, and is living his first life on earth, and in that way he behaves and conducts himself toward his beloved and toward all others.  Now each one chooses his love from the ranks of the beautiful according to his character, and he fashions him and adorns him\nlike a statue, as though he were his god, to honor and worship him.  The followers of Zeus desire that the soul of him whom they love be like Zeus;  so they seek for one of philosophical and lordly nature, and when they find him and love him, they do all they can to give him such a character.  If they have not previously had experience, they learn then from all who can teach them anything; \nthey seek after information themselves, and when they search eagerly within themselves to find the nature of their god, they are successful, because they have been compelled to keep their eyes fixed upon the god, and as they reach and grasp him by memory they are inspired and receive from him character and habits, so far as it is possible for a man to have part in God.  Now they consider the beloved the cause of all this, so they love him more than before, and if they draw the waters of their inspiration from Zeus, like the bacchantes, they pour it out upon the beloved and make him, so far as possible, like their god. \nAnd those who followed after Hera seek a kingly nature, and when they have found such an one, they act in a corresponding manner toward him in all respects;  and likewise the followers of Apollo, and of each of the gods, go out and seek for their beloved a youth whose nature accords with that of the god, and when they have gained his affection, by imitating the god themselves and by persuasion and education they lead the beloved to the conduct and nature of the god, so far as each of them can do so;  they exhibit no jealousy or meanness toward the loved one, but endeavor by every means in their power to lead him to the likeness\nof the god whom they honor.  Thus the desire of the true lovers, and the initiation into the mysteries of love, which they teach, if they accomplish what they desire in the way I describe, is beautiful and brings happiness from the inspired lover to the loved one, if he be captured;  and the fair one who is captured is caught in the following manner: In the beginning of this tale I divided each soul into three parts, two of which had the form of horses,\nthe third that of a charioteer.  Let us retain this division.  Now of the horses we say one is good and the other bad;  but we did not define what the goodness of the one and the badness of the other was.  That we must now do.  The horse that stands at the right hand is upright and has clean limbs;  he carries his neck high, has an aquiline nose, is white in color, and has dark eyes;  he is a friend of honor joined with temperance and modesty, and a follower of true glory;  he needs no whip, but is guided only by the word of command and by reason. \nThe other, however, is crooked, heavy, ill put together, his neck is short and thick, his nose flat, his color dark, his eyes grey and bloodshot;  he is the friend of insolence and pride, is shaggy-eared and deaf, hardly obedient to whip and spurs.  Now when the charioteer beholds the love-inspiring vision, and his whole soul is warmed by the sight, and is full of the tickling and\nprickings of yearning, the horse that is obedient the charioteer, constrained then as always by modesty, controls himself and does not leap upon the beloved;  but the other no longer heeds the pricks or the whip of the charioteer, but springs wildly forward, causing all possible trouble to his mate and to the charioteer, and forcing them to approach the beloved and propose the joys of love.  And they at first pull back indignantly and\nwill not be forced to do terrible and unlawful deeds;  but finally, as the trouble has no end, they go forward with him, yielding and agreeing to do his bidding.  And they come to the beloved and behold his radiant face. And as the charioteer looks upon him, his memory is borne back to the true nature of beauty, and he sees it standing with modesty upon a pedestal of chastity, and when he sees this he is afraid and falls backward in reverence, and in falling he is forced to pull the reins\nso violently backward as to bring both horses upon their haunches, the one quite willing, since he does not oppose him, but the unruly beast very unwilling.  And as they go away, one horse in his shame and wonder wets all the soul with sweat, but the other, as soon as he is recovered from the pain of the bit and the fail, before he has fairly taken breath, breaks forth into angry reproaches, bitterly reviling his mate and\nthe charioteer for their cowardice and lack of manhood in deserting their post and breaking their agreement;  and again, in spite of their unwillingness, he urges them forward and hardly yields to their prayer that he postpone the matter to another time.  Then when the time comes which they have agreed upon, they pretend that they have forgotten it, but he reminds them;  struggling, and neighing, and pulling he forces them again with the same purpose to approach the beloved one, and when they are near him, he lowers his head, raises his tail, takes the bit in his teeth,\nand pulls shamelessly.  The effect upon the charioteer is the same as before, but more pronounced;  he falls back like a racer from the starting-rope, pulls the bit backward even more violently than before from the teeth of the unruly horse, covers his scurrilous tongue and jaws with blood, and forces his legs and haunches to the ground, causing him much pain.  Now when the bad horse has gone through the same experience many times and has ceased from his unruliness, he is humbled and follows henceforth the wisdom of the charioteer, and when he sees the beautiful one, he is overwhelmed with fear;  and so from that time on the soul of the lover follows the beloved in reverence and awe.\n Now the beloved, since he receives all service from his lover, as if he were a god, and since the lover is not feigning, but is really in love, and since the beloved himself is by nature friendly to him who serves him, although he may at some earlier time have been prejudiced by his schoolfellows or others, who said that it was a disgrace to yield to a lover, and may for that reason have repulsed his lover, yet, as time goes on, his youth\nand destiny cause him to admit him to his society.  For it is the law of fate that evil can never be a friend to evil and that good must always be friend to good.  And when the lover is thus admitted, and the privilege of conversation and intimacy has been granted him, his good will, as it shows itself in close intimacy, astonishes the beloved, who discovers that the friendship of all his other friends and relatives is as nothing when compared with that of his inspired lover.  And as this intimacy continues and the lover comes near and touches the beloved in the gymnasia and in their general intercourse,\nthen the fountain of that stream which Zeus, when he was in love with Ganymede, called desire flows copiously upon the lover;  and some of it flows into him, and some, when he is filled, overflows outside;  and just as the wind or an echo rebounds from smooth, hard surfaces and returns whence it came, so the stream of beauty passes back into the beautiful one through the eyes, the natural inlet to the soul, where\nit reanimates the passages of the feathers, waters them and makes the feathers begin to grow, filling the soul of the loved one with love.  So he is in love, but he knows not with whom;  he does not understand his own condition and cannot explain it;  like one who has caught a disease of the eyes from another, he can give no reason for it;  he sees himself in his lover as in a mirror, but is not conscious of the fact.  And in the lover's presence, like him he ceases from his pain, and in his absence, like him he is filled with yearning such as he inspires, and love's image, requited love, dwells within him; \nbut he calls it, and believes it to be, not love, but friendship.  Like the lover, though less strongly, he desires to see his friend, to touch him, kiss him, and lie down by him;  and naturally these things are soon brought about.  Now as they lie together, the unruly horse of the lover has something to say to the charioteer, and demands a little enjoyment in return for his many troubles; \nand the unruly horse of the beloved says nothing, but teeming with passion and confused emotions he embraces and kisses his lover, caressing him as his best friend;  and when they lie together, he would not refuse his lover any favor, if he asked it;  but the other horse and the charioteer oppose all this with modesty and reason. If now the better elements of the mind, which lead to a well ordered life and to philosophy, prevail,\nthey live a life of happiness and harmony here on earth, self controlled and orderly, holding in subjection that which causes evil in the soul and giving freedom to that which makes for virtue;  and when this life is ended they are light and winged, for they have conquered in one of the three truly Olympic contests.  Neither human wisdom nor divine inspiration can confer upon man any greater blessing than this.  If however they live a life less noble and without philosophy, but yet ruled by the love of honor, probably,\nwhen they have been drinking, or in some other moment of carelessness, the two unruly horses, taking the souls off their guard, will bring them together and seize upon and accomplish that which is by the many accounted blissful;  and when this has once been done, they continue the practice, but infrequently, since what they are doing is not approved by the whole mind.  So these two pass through life as friends, though not such friends as the others,\nboth at the time of their love and afterwards, believing that they have exchanged the most binding pledges of love, and that they can never break them and fall into enmity.  And at last, when they depart from the body, they are not winged, to be sure, but their wings have begun to grow, so that the madness of love brings them no small reward;  for it is the law that those who have once begun their upward progress shall never again pass into darkness and the journey under the earth, but shall live a happy life in the light as they journey together, and because of their love shall be alike in their plumage when they receive their wings.\n These blessings, so great and so divine, the friendship of a lover will confer upon you, dear boy;  but the affection of the non-lover, which is alloyed with mortal prudence and follows mortal and parsimonious rules of conduct, will beget in the beloved soul the narrowness which the common folk praise as virtue;  it will cause the soul\nto be a wanderer upon the earth for nine thousand years and a fool below the earth at last.  There, dear Love, thou hast my recantation, which I have offered and paid as beautifully and as well as I could, especially in the poetical expressions which I was forced to employ on account of Phaedrus.  Pardon, I pray, my former words and accept these words with favor;  be kind and gracious to me;  do not in anger take from me the art of love which thou didst give me, and deprive me not of sight, but grant unto me to be even more than now esteemed by the beautiful. \nAnd if in our former discourse Phaedrus and I said anything harsh against thee, blame Lysias, the father of that discourse, make him to cease from such speeches, and turn him, as his brother Polemarchus is turned, toward philosophy, that his lover Phaedrus may no longer hesitate, as he does now, between two ways, but may direct his life with all singleness of purpose toward love and philosophical discourses."}}, {"speaker": "Phaedrus", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "257c", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "257d", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "I join in your prayer, Socrates,\nand pray that this may come to pass, if this is best for us.
