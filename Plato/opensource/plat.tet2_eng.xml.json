And  (thought), if you please, certainly denotes contemplation and consideration of generation ();  for to consider is the same as to contemplate.  Or, if you please,  (intelligence) is merely  (desire)  (of the new);  but that things are new shows that they are always being generated;\ntherefore the soul's desire for generation is declared by the giver of the name ;  for in antiquity the name was not , but two epsilons had to be spoken instead of the eta.   (self-restraint) is  (salvation) of  (wisdom), which we have just been discussing.\nAnd  (knowledge) indicates that the soul which is of any account accompanies () things in their motion, neither falling behind them nor running in front of them;  therefore we ought to insert an epsilon and call it .   (intelligence) in its turn is a kind of reckoning together;  when one says  (understand), the same thing as  is said;\nfor  means that the soul goes with things.  Certainly  (wisdom) denotes the touching of motion.  This word is very obscure and of foreign origin;  but we must remember that the poets often say of something which begins to advance  (it rushed).  There was a famous Laconian whose name was  (Rush), for this is the Laconian word for rapid motion.  Now  signifies the touching () of this rapid motion, the assumption being that things are in motion.  And the word  (good)\nis intended to denote the admirable () in all nature.  For since all things are in motion, they possess quickness and slowness;  now not all that is swift, but only part of it, is admirable;  this name  is therefore given to the admirable () part of the swift ().It is easy to conjecture that the word  applies to the understanding () of the just () but the word  (just) is itself difficult.  Up to a certain point, you see, many men seem to agree about it, but beyond that they differ.\nFor those who think the universe is in motion believe that the greater part of it is of such a nature as to be a mere receptacle, and that there is some element which passes through all this, by means of which all created things are generated.  And this element must be very rapid and very subtle;  for it could not pass through all the universe unless it were very subtle, so that nothing could keep it out, and it must be very swift, so that all other things are relatively at rest.  Since, then, it superintends and passes through () all other things,\nthis is rightly called by the name , the sound of the kappa being added merely for the sake of euphony.  Up to this point, as I said just now, many men agree about justice ();\nand I, Hermogenes, being very much in earnest about it, have persistently asked questions and have been told in secret teachings that this is justice, or the causefor that through which creation takes place is a causeand some one told me that it was for this reason rightly called Zeus ().  But when, after hearing this, I nevertheless ask them quietly, What then, my most excellent friend, if this is true, is justice? they think I am asking too many questions and am leaping over the trenches.\nThey say I have been told enough;  they try to satisfy me by saying all sorts of different things, and they no longer agree.  For one says the sun is justice, for the sun alone superintends all things, passing through and burning () them.  Then when I am pleased and tell this to some one, thinking it is a fine answer, he laughs at me and asks if I think there is no justice among men when the sun has set.  So I beg him to tell me what he thinks it is,\nand he says Fire.  But this is not easy to understand.  He says it is not actual fire, but heat in the abstract that is in the fire.  Another man says he laughs at all these notions, and that justice is what Anaxagoras says it is, mind;  for mind, he says, is ruled only by itself, is mixed with nothing, orders all things, and passes through them.  Then, my friend, I am far more perplexed than before I undertook to learn about the nature of justice.\nBut I think the nameand that was the subject of our investigationwas given for the reasons I have mentioned."}}, {"speaker": "Hermogenes", "p": "I think, Socrates, you must have heard this from some one and are not inventing it yourself."}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": "And how about the rest of my talk?"}, {"speaker": "Hermogenes", "p": "I do not at all think you had heard that."}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "413e", "@unit": "section"}, {"@unit": "page", "@n": "414"}, {"@n": "414a", "@unit": "section"}], "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)diki/a"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "tou= diai+o/ntos"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)drei/a"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "r(oh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)ndrei/a"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)nrei/a"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)/rren"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)nh/r"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)ndrei/a"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)/nw"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "gunh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "gonh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "qh=lu"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "qhlh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "qhlh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "teqhle/nai"}], "#text": "Listen then;  perhaps I may deceive you into thinking that all I am going to say is my own.

This, then, seems to be the meaning of evil motion (), that advance is halting and impeded;  and the soul that is infected by it becomes filled with wickedness ().  If these are the reasons for the name of wickedness, virtue () would be the opposite of this;  it would signify first ease of motion,\nand secondly that the flow of the good soul is always unimpeded, and therefore it has received this name, which designates that which always flows () without let or hindrance.

We have not as yet said why motion has the name ;  but it evidently should be , for in old times we did not employ eta, but epsilon.

So we should find that the ancient word corresponding to our modern form would be ; but now by the employment of the foreign word , change of epsilon to eta, and the insertion of nu it has become , though it ought to be  or .\nAnd  (rest) signifies the negation of motion, but is called  for euphony.  Well, the letter rho, as I was saying, appeared to be a fine instrument expressive of motion to the name-giver who wished to imitate rapidity, and he often applies it to motion.  In the first place, in the words  (flow) and  (current) he imitates their rapidity by this letter,\nthen in  (trembling) and in  (run), and also in such words as  (strike),  (break),  (rend),  (crush), (crumble),  (whirl), he expresses the action of them all chiefly by means of the letter rho;  for he observed, I suppose, that the tongue is least at rest and most agitated in pronouncing this letter, and that is probably the reason why he employed it for these words.  Iota again, he employs for everything subtle, which can most readily pass through all things.\nTherefore he imitates the nature of  (go) and  (hasten) by means of iota, just as he has imitated all such notions as  (cold, shivering),  (seething),  (shake), and  (shock) by means of phi, psi, sigma, and zeta, because those letters are pronounced with much breath.  Whenever he imitates that which resembles blowing, the giver of names always appears to use for the most part such letters.  And again he appears to have thought that the compression and pressure of the tongue in the pronunciation of delta and tau was naturally fitted\nto imitate the notion of binding and rest.  And perceiving that the tongue has a gliding movement most in the pronunciation of lambda, he made the words  (level),  (glide) itself,  (sleek),  (glutinous), and the like to conform to it.  Where the gliding of the tongue is stopped by the sound of gamma he reproduced the nature of  (glutinous),  (sweet), and  (gluey).\nAnd again, perceiving that nu is an internal sound, he made the words  (inside) and  (within), assimilating the meanings to the letters, and alpha again he assigned to greatness, and eta to length, because the letters are large.  He needed the sign  for the expression of  (round), and made it the chief element of the word.  And in this way the lawgiver appears to apply the other letters, making by letters and syllables a name for each and every thing, and from these names he compounds all the rest by imitation.\nThis, Hermogenes, appears to me to be the theory of the correctness of names, unless, indeed, Cratylus has some other view."}}, {"speaker": "Hermogenes", "p": {"milestone": {"@n": "427e", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "Truly, Socrates, as I said in the beginning, Cratylus often troubles me a good deal;  he declares that there is such a thing as correctness of names, but does not say clearly what it is;  and so I cannot tell whether he speaks so obscurely about it on any given occasion intentionally or unintentionally.\nSo now, Cratylus, tell me, in the presence of Socrates, do you like what Socrates says about names, or have you a better theory to propose?

But the greatest thing about my art is this,\nthat it can test in every way whether the mind of the young man is bringing forth a mere image, an imposture, or a real and genuine offspring.  For I have this in common with the midwives:  I am sterile in point of wisdom, and the reproach which has often been brought against me, that I question others but make no reply myself about anything, because I have no wisdom in me, is a true reproach;  and the reason of it is this:  the god compels me to act as midwife, but has never allowed me to bring forth.  I am, then, not at all a wise person myself,\nnor have I any wise invention, the offspring born of my own soul;  but those who associate with me, although at first some of them seem very ignorant, yet, as our acquaintance advances, all of them to whom the god is gracious make wonderful progress, not only in their own opinion, but in that of others as well.  And it is clear that they do this, not because they have ever learned anything from me, but because they have found in themselves many fair things and have brought them forth.  But the delivery is due to the god and me.  And the proof of it is this:  many before now,\nbeing ignorant of this fact and thinking that they were themselves the cause of their success, but despising me, have gone away from me sooner than they ought, whether of their own accord or because others persuaded them to do so.  Then, after they have gone away, they have miscarried thenceforth on account of evil companionship, and the offspring which they had brought forth through my assistance they have reared so badly that they have lost it;  they have considered impostures and images of more importance than the truth, and at last it was evident to themselves, as well as to others, that they were ignorant.  One of these was\nAristeides, the son of Lysimachus, and there are very many more.  When such men come back and beg me, as they do, with wonderful eagerness to let them join me again, the spiritual monitor that comes to me forbids me to associate with some of them, but allows me to converse with others, and these again make progress.  Now those who associate with me are in this matter also like women in childbirth;  they are in pain and are full of trouble night and day, much more than are the women;  and my art can arouse this pain and cause it to cease.  Well, that is what happens to them. \nBut in some cases, Theaetetus, when they do not seem to me to be exactly pregnant, since I see that they have no need of me, I act with perfect goodwill as match-maker and, under God, I guess very successfully with whom they can associate profitably, and I have handed over many of them to Prodicus, and many to other wise and inspired men. Now I have said all this to you at such length, my dear boy, because I suspect that you, as you yourself believe, are in pain because you are pregnant with something within you.  Apply, then, to me, remembering that I am the son of a midwife\nand have myself a midwife's gifts, and do your best to answer the questions I ask as I ask them.  And if, when I have examined any of the things you say, it should prove that I think it is a mere image and not real, and therefore quietly take it from you and throw it away, do not be angry as women are when they are deprived of their first offspring.  For many, my dear friend, before this have got into such a state of mind towards me that they are actually ready to bite me, if I take some foolish notion away from them, and they do not believe that I do this in kindness,\nsince they are far from knowing that no god is unkind to mortals, and that I do nothing of this sort from unkindness, either, and that it is quite out of the question for me to allow an imposture or to destroy the true.

For them the beginning, upon which all the things we were just now speaking of depend, is the assumption that everything is real motion and that there is nothing besides this, but that there are two kinds of motion, each infinite in the number of its manifestations, and of these kinds one has an active, the other a passive force.  From the union and friction of these two are born offspring, infinite in number, but always twins, the object of sense\nand the sense which is always born and brought forth together with the object of sense.  Now we give the senses names like these:  sight and hearing and smell, and the sense of cold and of heat, and pleasures and pains and desires and fears and so forth.  Those that have names are very numerous, and those that are unnamed are innumerable.  Now the class of objects of sense is akin to each of these;  all sorts of colors are akin to all sorts of acts of vision, and in the same way sounds to acts of hearing,\nand the other objects of sense spring forth akin to the other senses.  What does this tale mean for us, Theaetetus, with reference to what was said before?  Do you see?"}}, {"speaker": "Theaetetus", "p": "Not quite, Socrates."}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "156d", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "156e", "@unit": "section"}, {"@unit": "page", "@n": "157"}, {"@n": "157a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "157b", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "157c", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Just listen;  perhaps we can finish the tale.  It means, of course, that all these things are, as we were saying, in motion, and their motion has in it either swiftness or slowness.  Now the slow element keeps its motion in the same place and directed towards such things as draw near it, and indeed it is in this way that it begets. \nBut the things begotten in this way are quicker;  for they move from one place to another, and their motion is naturally from one place to another.  Now when the eye and some appropriate object which approaches beget whiteness and the corresponding perceptionwhich could never have been produced by either of them going to anything elsethen, while sight from the eye and\nwhiteness from that which helps to produce the color are moving from one to the other, the eye becomes full of sight and so begins at that moment to see, and becomes, certainly not sight, but a seeing eye, and the object which joined in begetting the color is filled with whiteness and becomes in its turn, not whiteness, but white, whether it be a stick or a stone, or whatever it be the hue of which is so colored.  And all the resthard and hot and so forthmust be regarded in the same way:  we must assume,\nwe said before, that nothing exists in itself, but all things of all sorts arise out of motion by intercourse with each other;  for it is, as they say, impossible to form a firm conception of the active or the passive element as being anything separately;  for there is no active element until there is a union with the passive element, nor is there a passive element until there is a union with the active;  and that which unites with one thing is active and appears again as passive when it comes in contact with something else.  And so it results from all this, as we said in the beginning, that nothing exists as invariably one, itself by itself, but everything is always becoming in relation to something, and being should be altogether abolished,\nthough we have oftenand even just nowbeen compelled by custom and ignorance to use the word.  But we ought not, the wise men say, to permit the use of something or somebody's or mine or this or that or any other word that implies making things stand still, but in accordance with nature we should speak of things as becoming and being made and being destroyed and changing;  for anyone who by his mode of speech makes things stand still is easily refuted.

But, you slovenly Socrates, the facts stand thus:  when you examine any doctrine of mine by the method of questioning, if the person who is questioned makes such replies as I should make and comes to grief, then I am refuted,\nbut if his replies are quite different, then the person questioned is refuted, not I.  Take this example.  Do you suppose you could get anybody to admit that the memory a man has of a past feeling he no longer feels is anything like the feeling at the time when he was feeling it?  Far from it.  Or that he would refuse to admit that it is possible for one and the same person to know and not to know one and the same thing?  Or if he were afraid to admit this, would he ever admit that a person who has become unlike is the same as before he became unlike?  In fact, if we are to be on our guard against such verbal entanglements, would he admit that a person is one at all, and not many, who become infinite in number,\nif the process of becoming different continues?  But, my dear fellow, he will say, attack my real doctrines in a more generous manner, and prove, if you can, that perceptions, when they come, or become, to each of us, are not individual, or that, if they are individual, what appears to each one would not, for all that, become to that one aloneor, if you prefer to say 'be,' would not beto whom it appears.  But when you talk of pigs and dog-faced baboons, you not only act like a pig yourself, but you persuade your hearers to act so toward my writings,\nand that is not right.  For I maintain that the truth is as I have written;  each one of us is the measure of the things that are and those that are not;  but each person differs immeasurably from every other in just this, that to one person some things appear and are, and to another person other things.  And I do not by any means say that wisdom and the wise man do not exist;  on the contrary, I say that if bad things appear and are to any one of us, precisely that man is wise who causes a change and makes good things appear and be to him. \nAnd, moreover, do not lay too much stress upon the words of my argument, but get a clearer understanding of my meaning from what I am going to say.  Recall to your mind what was said before, that his food appears and is bitter to the sick man, but appears and is the opposite of bitter to the man in health.  Now neither of these two is to be made wiser than he isthat is not possible\nnor should the claim be made that the sick man is ignorant because his opinions are ignorant, or the healthy man wise because his are different;  but a change must be made from the one condition to the other, for the other is better.  So, too, in education a change has to be made from a worse to a better condition;  but the physician causes the change by means of drugs, and the teacher of wisdom by means of words.  And yet, in fact, no one ever made anyone think truly who previously thought falsely, since it is impossible to think that which is not or to think any other things than those which one feels;  and these are always true.  But I believe that a man who, on account of a bad condition of soul,\nthinks thoughts akin to that condition, is made by a good condition of soul to think correspondingly good thoughts;  and some men, through inexperience, call these appearances true, whereas I call them better than the others, but in no wise truer.  And the wise, my dear Socrates, I do not by any means call tadpoles when they have to do with the human body, I call them physicians, and when they have to do with plants, husbandmen;  for I assert that these latter, when plants are sickly, instil into them good and healthy sensations,\nand true ones instead of bad sensations, and that the wise and good orators make the good, instead of the evil, seem to be right to their states.  For I claim that whatever seems right and honorable to a state is really right and honorable to it, so long as it believes it to be so;  but the wise man causes the good, instead of that which is evil to them in each instance, to be and seem right and honorable.  And on the same principle the teacher who is able to train his pupils in this manner is not only wise but is also\nentitled to receive high pay from them when their education is finished.  And in this sense it is true that some men are wiser than others, and that no one thinks falsely, and that you, whether you will or no, must endure to be a measure.  Upon these positions my doctrine stands firm;  and if you can dispute it in principle, dispute it by bringing an opposing doctrine against it;  or if you prefer the method of questions, ask questions;  for an intelligent person ought not to reject this method, on the contrary, he should choose it before all others.  However, let me make a suggestion:  do not be unfair in your questioning; \nit is very inconsistent for a man who asserts that he cares for virtue to be constantly unfair in discussion;  and it is unfair in discussion when a man makes no distinction between merely trying to make points and carrying on a real argument.  In the former he may jest and try to trip up his opponent as much as he can, but in real argument he must be in earnest and must set his interlocutor on his feet, pointing out to him those slips only which are due to himself and\nhis previous associations.  For if you act in this way, those who debate with you will cast the blame for their confusion and perplexity upon themselves, not upon you;  they will run after you and love you, and they will hate themselves and run away from themselves, taking refuge in philosophy, that they may escape from their former selves by becoming different.  But if you act in the opposite way, as most teachers do, you will produce the opposite result, and instead of making your young associates philosophers, you will make them hate philosophy\nwhen they grow older.  If therefore, you will accept the suggestion which I made before, you will avoid a hostile and combative attitude and in a gracious spirit will enter the lists with me and inquire what we really mean when we declare that all things are in motion and that whatever seems is to each individual, whether man or state.  And on the basis of that you will consider the question whether knowledge and perception are the same or different, instead of doing as you did a while ago, using as your basis\nthe ordinary meaning of names and words, which most people pervert in haphazard ways and thereby cause all sorts of perplexity in one another.

For then, in the beginning, God ruled and supervised the whole revolution, and so again, in the same way, all the parts of the universe were divided by regions among gods who ruled them, and, moreover, the animals were distributed by species and flocks among inferior deities as divine shepherds, each of whom was in all respects the independent guardian of the creatures under his own care,\nso that no creature was wild, nor did they eat one another, and there was no war among them, nor any strife whatsoever.  To tell all the other consequences of such an order of the world would be an endless task.  But the reason for the story of the spontaneous life of mankind is as follows:  God himself was their shepherd, watching over them, just as man, being an animal of different and more divine nature than the rest, now tends the lower species of animals.  And under his care there were no states,\nnor did men possess wives or children;  for they all came to life again out of the earth, with no recollection of their former lives.  So there were no states or families, but they had fruits in plenty from the trees and other plants, which the earth furnished them of its own accord, without help from agriculture.  And they lived for the most part in the open air, without clothing or bedding;  for the climate was tempered for their comfort, and the abundant grass that grew up out of the earth furnished them soft couches.\nThat, Socrates, was the life of men in the reign of Cronus;  but the life of the present age, which is said to be the age of Zeus, you know by your own experience.  Would you be able and willing to decide which of them is the more blessed?"}}, {"speaker": "Younger Socrates", "p": "Certainly not."}, {"speaker": "Stranger", "p": "Shall I, then, make some sort of a judgement for you?"}, {"speaker": "Younger Socrates", "p": "Do so, by all means."}, {"speaker": "Stranger", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "272c", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "272d", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "272e", "@unit": "section"}, {"@unit": "page", "@n": "273"}, {"@n": "273a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "273b", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "273c", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "273d", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "273e", "@unit": "section"}, {"@unit": "page", "@n": "274"}, {"@n": "274a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "274b", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "274c", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "274d", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "274e", "@unit": "section"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "Loeb", "#text": "The fellow-artisan of Hephaestus is Athena;  seeds and plants are the gifts of Demeter and Dionysus."}, "#text": "Well, then, if the foster children of Cronus, having all this leisure and the ability to converse not only with human beings but also with beasts,\nmade full use of all these opportunities with a view to philosophy, talking with the animals and with one another and learning from every creature that, through possession of some peculiar power he may have had in any respect beyond his fellows perceptions tending towards an increase of wisdom, it would be easy to decide that the people of those old times were immeasurably happier than those of our epoch.  Or if they merely ate and drank till they were full and gossiped with each other and the animals, telling such stories as are even now told about them,\nin that case, too, it would, in my opinion, be very easy to reach a decision.  However, let us pass those matters by, so long as there is no one capable of reporting to us what the desires of the people in those days were in regard to knowledge and the employment of speech.  The reason why we revived this legend must be told, in order that we may get ahead afterwards.  For when the time of all those conditions was accomplished and the change was to take place and all the earth-born race had at length been used up,\nsince every soul had fulfilled all its births by falling into the earth as seed its prescribed number of times, then the helmsman of the universe dropped the tiller and withdrew to his place of outlook, and fate and innate desire made the earth turn backwards.  So, too, all the gods who share, each in his own sphere, the rule of the Supreme Spirit, promptly perceiving what was taking place, let go the parts of the world which were under their care.\nAnd as the universe was turned back and there came the shock of collision, as the beginning and the end rushed in opposite directions, it produced a great earthquake within itself and caused a new destruction of all sorts of living creatures.  But after that, when a sufficient time had elapsed, there was rest now from disturbance and confusion, calm followed the earthquakes, and the world went on its own accustomed course in orderly fashion, exercising care and rule\nover itself and all within itself, and remembering and practising the teachings of the Creator and Father to the extent of its power, at first more accurately and at last more carelessly;  and the reason for this was the material element in its composition, because this element, which was inherent in the primeval nature, was infected with great disorder before the attainment of the existing orderly universe.  For from its Composer the universe has received only good things;  but from its previous condition it retains in itself and creates in the animals all the elements of harshness and injustice\nwhich have their origin in the heavens.  Now as long as the world was nurturing the animals within itself under the guidance of the Pilot, it produced little evil and great good;  but in becoming separated from him it always got on most excellently during the time immediately after it was let go, but as time went on and it grew forgetful, the ancient condition of disorder prevailed more and more\nand towards the end of the time reached its height, and the universe, mingling but little good with much of the opposite sort, was in danger of destruction for itself and those within it.  Therefore at that moment God, who made the order of the universe, perceived that it was in dire trouble, and fearing that it might founder in the tempest of confusion and sink in the boundless sea of diversity,\nhe took again his place as its helmsman, reversed whatever had become unsound and unsettled in the previous period when the world was left to itself, set the world in order, restored it and made it immortal and ageless.  So now the whole tale is told;  but for our purpose of exhibiting the nature of the king it will be enough to revert to the earlier part of the story.  For when the universe was turned again into the present path of generation, the age of individuals came again to a stop, and that led to new processes, the reverse of those which had gone before.  For the animals which had grown so small as almost to disappear grew larger, and those newly born from the earth with hoary hair died and passed below the earth again.  And all other things changed,\nimitating the condition of the universe and conforming to it, and so too pregnancy and birth and nurture necessarily imitated and conformed to the rest;  for no living creature could any longer come into being by the union of other elements, but just as the universe was ordered to be the ruler of its own course, so in the same way the parts were ordered, so far as they could, to grow and beget and give nourishment of themselves under the same guidance.\nAnd now we have come at last to the point for the sake of which this whole discourse was begun.  For much might be said, and at great length, about the other animals, their previous forms and the causes of their several changes;  but about mankind there is less to say and it is more to our purpose.  For men, deprived of the care of the deity who had possessed and tended us, since most of the beasts who were by nature unfriendly had grown fierce, and they themselves were feeble and unprotected, were ravaged by the beasts\nand were in the first ages still without resources or skill;  the food which had formerly offered itself freely had failed them, and they did not yet know how to provide for themselves, because no necessity had hitherto compelled them.  On all these accounts they were in great straits;  and that is the reason why the gifts of the gods that are told of in the old traditions were given us with the needful information and instruction,fire by Prometheus, the arts by Hephaestus and the goddess who is his fellow-artisan, seeds and plants by other deities.\nAnd from these has arisen all that constitutes human life, since, as I said a moment ago, the care of the gods had failed men and they had to direct their own lives and take care of themselves, like the whole universe, which we imitate and follow through all time, being born and living now in our present manner and in that other epoch in the other manner.\nSo, then, let our tale be finished;  but we will turn it to account for opening our eyes to the great error we made in the exposition of the king and the statesman in our earlier discussion."}}, {"speaker": "Younger Socrates", "p": "How, then, did we err, and what is the great error you say we have committed?"}, {"speaker": "Stranger", "p": "In one way we made a comparatively slight error, in another a very important one, much greater and more far-reaching than the first."}, {"speaker": "Younger Socrates", "p": "How did we do that?"}, {"speaker": "Stranger", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "page", "@n": "275"}, {"@n": "275a", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "When we were asked about the king and the statesman of the present movement of the world and mode of generation, we told of the shepherd of the human flock in the time of the reverse movement,\nand he was a god, not a man, besides.
