So, for example, it is not sufficient to say that Zeuxis is a painter, i.e. one who either paints or has painted pictures; but in order to distinguish him from other painters, who also paint or have painted pictures, we must state more nearly the kind of pictures which he has painted (), as he who painted the Helena or the Penelope.

Meanwhile, her sons were being brought up by a herdsman in the forest. Amphion devoted himself entirely to music, while the active and restless Zethus spent his time in hunting and the care of his herds. Finally Antiope escapes from her prison, and hurries to her sons. Dirce pursues, overtakes her, and is just in the act of having her bound to a wild steer, when the sons, who had been informed of their parentage by the herdsman, appear on the scene, rescue their mother from the hands of Dirce, and bind her to the steer instead. Dirce was then changed into a fountain. Amphion and Zethus attain the sovereignty in Thebes, and fortify it with walls. In this work Zethus contributed his great bodily strength, while Amphion's lyre drew after him the stones.
