But these two, in the first place, are most formidable in body and in fight against all comersfor they are not only well skilled themselves in fighting under arms,\nbut are able to impart that skill, for a fee, to another;  and further, they are most competent also to fight the battle of the law-courts and teach others how to speak, or to have composed for them, such speeches as may win their suits.  Formerly they had merely some ability for this;  but now they have put the finishing touch to their skill as all-round sportsmen.

By some providence I chanced to be sitting in the place where you saw me, in the undressing-room, alone, and was just intending to get up and go;  but the moment I did so, there came my wonted spiritual sign.  So I sat down again,\nand after a little while these two persons enteredEuthydemus and Dionysodorusand accompanying them, quite a number, as it seemed to me, of their pupils:  the two men came in and began walking round inside the cloister.  Hardly had they taken two or three turns, when in stepped Cleinias, who you say has come on so much, and you are right:  behind him was a whole troop of lovers, and among them Ctesippus, a young fellow from Paeania, of gentle birth and breeding, except for a certain insolence of youth. \nSo when Cleinias as he entered caught sight of me sitting there alone, he came straight across and sat beside me on my right, just as you say.  Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, when they saw him, stood at first talking with each other, and casting an occasional glance at usfor my attention was fixed on thembut then one of them, Euthydemus, took a seat by the youth, and the other next to me on my left;  the rest, where each happened to find one.\n So I greeted the two brothers, as not having seen them for some time;  after that I said to Cleinias:  My dear Cleinias, these two men, you know, are skilled not in little things, but in great.  For they understand all about war, that is, as much as is needful for him who is to be a good general;  both the tactics and the strategy of armies, and all the teaching of troops under arms;  and they can also enable one to get redress in the law courts for a wrong that one may have suffered.When I had said this,\nI saw they despised me for it, and they both laughed, looking at each other;  then Euthydemus said:  No, no, Socrates, we do not make those matters our business now;  we deal with them as diversions.At this I wondered and said:  Your business must be a fine one, if such great matters are indeed diversions to you;  so I beseech you, tell me what this fine business is.Virtue, Socrates, he replied, is what we deem ourselves able to purvey in a pre-eminently excellent and speedy manner.\n Good heavens, I exclaimed, a mighty affair indeed!  Where did you have the luck to pick it up?  I was still considering you, as I remarked just now, to be chiefly skilled in fighting under arms, and so spoke of you in those terms:  for when you visited, our city before, this, I recollect, was the profession you made.  But if you now in truth possess this other knowledge, have mercyyou see I address you just as though you were a couple of gods, beseeching you to forgive my former remarks. \nBut make sure, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, that you spoke the truth:  for the vastness of your promise gives me some excuse for disbelieving.You may be sure, Socrates, they replied, it is as we say.Then I congratulate you on your acquisition far more than I do the great king on his empire:  only tell me whether you intend to exhibit this science of yours, or what you have determined to do.We are here for the very purpose, Socrates, of exhibiting\nand expounding it to anyone who wishes to learn.Well, I guarantee that all who do not possess it will wish tomyself to begin with, then Cleinias here and, besides us, Ctesippus and all these others, I said, showing him the lovers of Cleinias, who were by this time standing about us.  For Ctesippus, as it happened, was sitting some way from Cleinias, I noticed;  and by chance, as Euthydemus leant forward\nin talking to me he obscured Ctesipus' view of Cleinias, who was between us.  Then Ctesippus, desiring to gaze on his favorite and being also an eager listener, led the way by jumping up and placing himself opposite us;  and this made the others, on seeing what he did, stand around us, both Cleinias' lovers and the followers of Euthydemus and Dionysodorus.  Pointing to these, I told Euthydemus that they were all ready to learn;  to which Ctesippus assented with great eagerness,\nand so did the rest;  and they all joined in urging the two men to exhibit the power of their wisdom.On this I remarked:  My good Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, you must do your very best to gratify my friends and, for my sake also, to give us an exhibition.  To do it in full, of course, would obviously be a lengthy performance:  but tell me one thingwill you be able to make a good man of him only who is already convinced that he should learn of you,\nor of him also who is not yet so convinced, owing to an absolute disbelief that virtue is a thing that can be learnt or that you are teachers of it?  Come now, is it the business of this same art to persuade such a man that virtue is teachable and that you are the men of whom one may best learn it, or does this need some other art?No, this same one can do it, Socrates, said Dionysodorus.Then you two, Dionysodorus, I said, would be the best persons now on earth to incite one to the pursuit of knowledge\nand the practice of virtue?We think so, at least, Socrates.Well then, please defer the display of all the rest to some other occasion, I said, and exhibit this one thing.  You are to persuade this young fellow here that he ought to ensue wisdom and practise virtue, and so you will oblige both me and all these present.  This youth happens to be in just the sort of condition I speak of;  and I and all of us here are at this moment anxious for him to become as good as possible.  He is the son of Axiochus, son of the former Alcibiades,\n and is own cousin to the Alcibiades that now is:  his name is Cleinias.  He is young;  and so we have fears for him, as well one may for a young man, lest someone forestall us and turn his inclination to some other course of life, and so corrupt him.  Hence your arrival now is most happy.  Come now, if it is all the same to you, make trial of the lad and talk with him in our presence.When I had thus spoken, in almost these very words, Euthydemus answered in a tone both manly and dashing:  Oh, it is all the same to us,\nSocrates, provided the youth is willing to answer us.Why, in fact, I said, that is just what he is used to:  these people here are constantly coming to him and asking him a number of questions and debating with him, so he is a fairly fearless answerer.What ensued, Crito, how am I to relate in proper style?  For no slight matter it is to be able to recall in description such enormous knowledge as theirs. \nConsequently, like the poets, I must needs begin my narrative with an invocation of the Muses and Memory.  Well, Euthydemus set to work, so far as I remember, in terms very much the same as these:  Cleinias, which sort of men are the learners, the wise or the foolish?At this the young man, feeling the embarrassment of the question, blushed and glanced at me in his helplessness.  So I, perceiving his confusion, said:  Have no fear, Cleinias;  answer bravely,\nwhichever you think it is:  for perchance he is doing you the greatest service in the world.Meanwhile Dionysodorus leant over a little to me, with a broad smile on his face, and whispered in my ear:  Let me tell you, Socrates, beforehand that, whichever way the lad answers, he will be confuted.While he was saying this, Cleinias made his reply, so that I was unable even to advise\nthe boy to be wary:  he replied that it was the wise who were the learners.Then Euthydemus asked:  And are there persons whom you call teachers, or not?He agreed that there were.And the teachers of the learners are teachers in the same way as your lute-master and your writing-master, I suppose, were teachers of you and the other boys, while you were pupils?He assented.Now, of course, when you were learning, you did not yet know the things you were learning?\n No, he said.So were you wise, when you did not know those things?No, to be sure, he said.Then if not wise, foolish?Certainly.So when you learnt what you did not know, you learnt while being foolish.To this the lad nodded assent.Hence it is the foolish who learn, Cleinias, and not the wise, as you suppose.When he had thus spoken, all those followers of Dionysodorus\nand Euthydemus raised a cheer and a laugh, like a chorus at the signal of their director;  and before the boy could fairly and fully recover his breath Dionysodorus took up the cudgels and said:  Well now, Cleinias, whenever your writing-master dictated from memory, which of the boys learnt the piece recited, the wise or the foolish?The wise, said Cleinias.So it is the wise who learn, and not the foolish:  hence the answer you gave just now to Euthydemus was a bad one.\n Thereupon arose a great deal of laughter and loud applause from the pair's adorers, in admiration of their cleverness;  while we on our side were dismayed and held our peace.  Then Euthydemus, observing our dismay, and seeking to astonish us still further, would not let the boy go, but went on questioning him and, like a skilful dancer, gave a twofold twist to his questions on the same point:  Now, do the learners learn what they know, he asked, or what they do not?Then Dionysodorus whispered to me again softly: \nHere comes a second one, Socrates, just like the first.Heavens!  I replied:  surely the first question served you well enough.All our questions, Socrates, he said, are like that;  they leave no escape.And consequently, as it seems to me, I remarked, you have this high repute among your disciples.Meanwhile Cleinias answered Euthydemus, that learners learnt what they did not know;  so he had to meet the same course of questions as before: \nWell then, asked the other, do you not know your letters?Yes, he said.All of them?He admitted it.Now when anyone dictates some piece or other, does he not dictate letters?He admitted it.And he dictates things of which you know something, since you know all of them?He admitted this too.Well now, said the other, surely you do not learn whatever such a person dictates;  it is rather he who does not know his letters that learns?No, he replied;  I learn.Then you learn what you know, since you know all your letters.\n He agreed.So your answer was not correct, he said.The last word was hardly out of Euthydemus' mouth when Dionysodorus caught, as it were, the ball of the argument and, aiming at the boy again, said:  Euthydemus is deceiving you, Cleinias.  Tell me, is not learning the reception of knowledge of that which one learns?Cleinias agreed.And is not knowing, he went on, just having knowledge at the time?He assented.So that not knowing\nis not yet having knowledge?He agreed with him.Then are those who receive anything those who have it already, or those who have it not?Those who have it not.And you have admitted that those who do not know belong also to this class of those who have it not?He nodded assent.And the learners belong to the class of the receiving and not to that of the having?He agreed.Hence it is those who do not know that learn, Cleinias, and not those who know.Euthydemus was proceeding to press the youth for the third fall, when I,\nperceiving the lad was going under, and wishing to give him some breathing-space lest he should shame us by losing heart, encouraged him with these words:  Cleinias, do not be surprised that these arguments seem strange to you;  for perhaps you do not discern what our two visitors are doing to you.  They are acting just like the celebrants of the Corybantic rites, when they perform the enthronement of the person whom they are about to initiate.  There, as you know, if you have been through it, they have dancing and merrymaking:  so here these two\nare merely dancing about you and performing their sportive gambols with a view to your subsequent initiation.  You must now, accordingly, suppose you are listening to the first part of the professorial mysteries.  First of all, as Prodicus says, you have to learn about the correct use of wordsthe very point that our two visitors are making plain to you, namely, that you were unaware that learning is the name which people apply on the one hand to the case of a man who, having originally no knowledge about some matter, in course of time receives such knowledge; \nand on the other hand the same word is applied when, having the knowledge already, he uses that knowledge for the investigation of the same matter whether occurring in action or in speech.  It is true that they tend rather to call it understanding than learning, but occasionally they call it learning too;  and this point, as our friends are demonstrating, has escaped your noticehow the same word is used for people who are in the opposite conditions of knowing and not knowing.  A similar point underlay the second question, where they asked you\nwhether people learn what they know, or what they do not.  Such things are the sport of the sciencesand that is why I tell you these men are making game of you;  I call it sport because, although one were to learn many or even all of such tricks, one would be not a whit the wiser as to the true state of the matters in hand, but only able to make game of people, thanks to the difference in the sense of the words, by tripping them up and overturning them;  just as those who slyly pull stools away from persons who are about to sit down\nmake merry and laugh when they see one sprawling on one's back.  So far, then, you are to regard these gentlemen's treatment of you as mere play:  but after this they will doubtless display to you their own serious object, while I shall keep them on the track and see that they fulfil the promise they gave me.  They said they would exhibit their skill in exhortation;  but instead, I conceive, they thought fit to make sport with you first.  So now, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus,\nlet us have done with your sport:  I daresay you have had as much as you want.  What you have next to do is to give us a display of exhorting this youth as to how he should devote himself to wisdom and virtue.  But first I shall explain to you how I regard this matter and how I desire to hear it dealt with.  If I strike you as treating it in a crude and ridiculous manner, do not laugh me to scorn;  for in my eagerness\nto listen to your wisdom I shall venture to improvise in your presence.  So both you and your disciples must restrain yourselves and listen without laughing;  and you, son of Axiochus, answer me this:Do all we human beings wish to prosper?  Or is this question one of the absurdities I was afraid of just now?  For I suppose it is stupid merely to ask such things, since every man must wish to prosper.\n Everyone in the world, said Cleinias.Well then, I asked, as to the next step, since we wish to prosper, how can we prosper?  Will it be if we have many good things?  Or is this an even sillier question than the other?  For surely this too must obviously be so.He agreed.Come now, of things that are, what sort do we hold to be really good ?  Or does it appear to be no difficult matter, and no problem for an important person, to find here too a ready answer?  Anyone will tell us that to be rich is good, surely?Quite true, he said.Then it is the same with being healthy and handsome, and having the other bodily endowments\nin plenty?He agreed.Again, it is surely clear that good birth and talents and distinctions in one's own country are good things.He admitted it.Then what have we still remaining, I asked, in the class of goods?  What of being temperate, and just, and brave?  I bay you tell me, Cleinias, do you think we shall be right in ranking these as goods, or in rejecting them?  For it may be that someone will dispute it.  How does it strike you?They are goods;  said Cleinias.Very well, I went on,\nand where in the troupe shall we station wisdom?  Among the goods, or how?Among the goods.Then take heed that we do not pass over any of the goods that may deserve mention.I do not think we are leaving any out, said Cleinias.Hereupon I recollected one and said:  Yes, by Heaven, we are on the verge of omitting the greatest of the goods.What is that? he asked.Good fortune, Cleinias:  a thing which all men, even the worst fools, refer to as the greatest of goods.You are right, he said.Once again I reconsidered and said: \nWe have almost made ourselves laughing-stocks, you and I, son of Axiochus, for our visitors.What is wrong now? he asked.Why, after putting good fortune in our former list, we have just been discussing the same thing again.What is the point?Surely it is ridiculous, when a thing has been before us all the time, to set it forth again and go over the same ground twice.To what are you referring? he asked.Wisdom, I replied, is presumably good fortune:  even a child could see that.He wondered at thishe is still so young and simple-minded:  then I, perceiving his surprise, went on:  Can you be unaware,\nCleinias, that for success in flute-music it is the flute-players that have the best fortune?He agreed to this.Then in writing and reading letters it will be the schoolmasters.Certainly.Well now, for the dangers of a sea-voyage, do you consider any pilots to he more fortunate, as a general rule, than the wise ones?No, to be sure.Well, then, suppose you were on a campaign, with which kind of general would you prefer to share both the peril and the lucka wise one, or an ignorant?With a wise one.Well then, supposing you were sick, with which kind of doctor would you like to venture yourself a wise one, or an ignorant?With a wise one.\n And your reason, I said, is this, that you would fare with better fortune in the hands of a wise one than of an ignorant one?He assented.So that wisdom everywhere causes men to be fortunate:  since I presume she could never err, but must needs be right in act and result;  otherwise she could be no longer wisdom.We came to an agreement somehow or other\nin the end that the truth in general was this:  when wisdom is present, he with whom it is present has no need of good fortune as well;  and as we had agreed on this I began to inquire of him over again what we should think, in this case, of our previous agreements.  For we agreed, said I, that if many goods were present to us we should be happy and prosper.Yes, he said.Then would we be happy because of our present goods, if they gave us no benefit, or if they gave us some?If they gave us benefit, he said.And would a thing benefit us if we merely had it\nand did not use it?  For instance, if we had a lot of provisions, but did not eat them, or liquor, and did not drink it, could we be said to be benefited?Of course not, he answered.Well then, if every craftsman found the requisites for his particular work all ready prepared for him, and then made no use of them, would he prosper because of these acquisitions, as having acquired all the things necessary for a craftsman to have at hand?  For example, if a carpenter were furnished with all his tools and a good supply of wood, but did no carpentry, is it possible he could be benefited\nby what he had got?By no means, he said.Well now, suppose a man had got wealth and all the goods that we mentioned just now, but made no use of them;  would he be happy because of his possessing these goods?Surely not, Socrates.So it seems one must not merely have acquired such goods if one is to be happy, but use them too;  else there is no benefit gained from their possession.True.Then have we here enough means,\nCleinias, for making a man happyin the possession of these goods and using them?I think so.Shall we say, I asked, if he uses them rightly, or just as much if he does not?If rightly.Well answered, I said;  for I suppose there is more mischief when a man uses anything wrongly than when he lets it alone.  In the one case there is evil;  in the other there is neither evil\nnor good. May we not state it so?He agreed.To proceed then:  in the working and use connected with wood, is there anything else that effects the right use than the knowledge of carpentry?  Surely not, he said.Further, I presume that in the working connected with furniture it is knowledge that effects the right work.Yes, he said.Then similarly, I went on, in the use of the goods we mentioned at firstwealth and health and beautywas it knowledge that showed the way to the right use of all those advantages\nand rectified their conduct, or was it something else?Knowledge, he replied.So that knowledge, it would seem, supplies mankind not only with good luck, but with welfare, in all that he either possesses or conducts.He agreed.Then can we, in Heaven's name, get any benefit from all the other possessions without understanding and wisdom?  Shall we say that a man will profit more by possessing much and doing much when he has no sense, than he will if he does and possesses little?  Consider it this way: \nwould he not err less if he did less;  and so, erring less, do less ill;  and hence, doing less ill, be less miserable?Certainly, he said.In which of the two cases, when one is poor or when one is rich, will one be more likely to do less?When one is poor, he said.And when one is weak, or when one is strong?Weak.And when one has high position, or has none?None.When one is brave and self-controlled, will one do less, or when one is a coward?A coward.So too, when idle rather than busy?He agreed.And slow rather than quick,\nand dim of sight and hearing rather than sharp?We agreed with each other as to these and all such cases.To sum up then, Cleinias, I proceeded, it seems that, as regards the whole lot of things which at first we termed goods, the discussion they demand is not on the question of how they are in themselves and by nature goods, but rather, I conceive, as follows:  if they are guided by ignorance, they are greater evils than their opposites, according as they are more capable of ministering to their evil guide;  whereas if understanding and wisdom guide them,\nthey are greater goods;  but in themselves neither sort is of any worth.I think the case appears, he replied, to be as you suggest.Now what result do we get from our statements?  Is it not precisely that, of all the other things, not one is either good or bad, but of these two, wisdom is good and ignorance bad?\n He agreed.Let us consider then, I said, the further conclusion that lies before us.  Since we are all eager to be happy, and since we were found to become so by not only using things but using them aright, while knowledge, we saw, was that which provided the rightness and good fortune, it seems that every man must prepare himself by all available means so that he may be as wise as possible.  Is it not so?Yes, he said.And if a man thinks, as well he may,\nthat he ought to get this endowment from his father much more than money, and also from his guardians and his ordinary friends, and from those who profess to be his lovers, whether strangers or fellow-citizenspraying and beseeching them to give him his share of wisdom;  there is no disgrace, Cleinias, or reprobation in making this a reason for serving and being a slave to either one's lover or any man, and being ready to perform any service that is honorable in one's eagerness to become wise.  Is not this your view? I asked.I think you are\nperfectly right, he replied.Yes, Cleinias, I went on, if wisdom is teachable, and does not present itself to mankind of its own accordfor this is a question that we have still to consider as not yet agreed on by you and me.For my part, Socrates, he said, I think it is teachable.At this I was glad, and said:  Well spoken indeed, my excellent friend!  How good of you to relieve me of a long inquiry into this very point, whether wisdom is teachable or not teachable!  So now, since you think it is both teachable and\nthe only thing in the world that makes man happy and fortunate, can you help saying that it is necessary to pursue wisdom or intending to pursue it yourself?Why, said he, I do say so, Socrates, with all my might.So I, delighted to hear this, said:  There, Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, is my illustration of what I desire a hortatory argument to berough and ready, perhaps, and expressed at laborious length:  now let either of you who wishes to do so give us an example of an artist's handling of this same matter.  If you do not wish to do that,\nlet your display begin where I left off, and show the lad whether he ought to acquire every kind of knowledge, or whether there is a single sort of it which one must obtain if one is to be both happy and a good man, and what it is.  For as I was saying at the outset, it really is a matter of great moment to us that this youth should become\nwise and good.These were my words, Crito;  and I set about giving the closest attention to what should follow, and observing in what fashion they would deal with the question, and how they would start exhorting the youth to practise wisdom and virtue.  So then the elder of them, Dionysodorus, entered first upon the discussion, and we all turned our eyes on him expecting to hear, there and then, some wonderful arguments.  And this result we certainly got; \nfor wondrous, in a way, Crito, was the argument that the man then ushered forth, which is worth your hearing as a notable incitement to virtue.Tell me, Socrates, he said, and all you others who say you desire this youth to become wise, whether you say this in jest or truly and earnestly desire it.At this I reflected that previously, as it seemed, they took us to be jesting, when we urged them to converse with the youth, and hence they made a jest of it\nand did not take it seriously.  This reflection therefore made me insist all the more that we were in deadly earnest.Then Dionysodorus said:  Yet be careful, Socrates, that you do not have to deny what you say now.I know what I am about, I said:  I know I shall never deny it.Well now, he proceeded;  you tell me you wish him to become wise?Certainly.And at present, be asked, is Cleinias wise or not?He says he is not yet sohe is no vain pretender.And you, he went on,\nwish him to become wise, and not to be ignorant?We agreed.So you wish him to become what he is not, and to be no longer what he now is.When I heard this I was confused;  and he, striking in on my confusion, said:  Of course then, since you wish him to be no longer what he now is, you wish him, apparently, to be dead.  And yet what valuable friends and lovers they must be, who would give anything to know their darling was dead and gone!\n Ctesippus, on hearing this, was annoyed on his favorite's account, and said:  Stranger of , were it not rather a rude thing to say, I should tell you, ill betide your design of speaking so falsely of me and my friends as to make outwhat to me is almost too profane even to repeatthat I could wish this boy to be dead and gone!Why, Ctesippus, said Euthydemus, do you think it possible to lie?To be sure, I do, he replied:  I should be mad otherwise.Do you mean, when one tells the thing about which\none is telling, or when one does not?When one tells it, he said.Then if you tell it, you tell just that thing which you tell, of all that are, and nothing else whatever?Of course, said Ctesippus.Now the thing that you tell is a single one, distinct from all the others there are.Certainly.Then the person who tells that thing tells that which is?Yes.But yet, surely he who tells what is, and things that are, tells the truth:  so that Dionysodorus, if he tells things that are, tells the truth and speaks no lie about you.Yes, said Ctesippus; \nbut he who speaks as he did, Euthydemus, does not say things that are.Then Euthydemus asked him:  And the things which are not, surely are not?They are not.Then nowhere can the things that are not be?Nowhere.Then is it possible for anyone whatever so to deal with these things that are not as to make them be when they are nowhere?I think not, said Ctesippus.Well now, when orators speak before the people, do they do nothing?No, they do something, he replied.Then if they do,\nthey also make?Yes.Now, is speaking doing and making?He agreed that it is.No one, I suppose, speaks what is notfor thereby he would be making something;  and you have agreed that one cannot so much as make what is notso that, by your account, no one speaks what is false, while if Dionysodorus speaks, he speaks what is true and is.Yes, in faith, Euthydemus, said Ctesippus;  but somehow or other he speaks what is, only not as it is.How do you mean, Ctesippus? said Dionysodorus. \nAre there persons who tell things as they are?Why surely, he replied, there are gentlemenpeople who speak the truth?Well, he went on, good things are in good case, bad in bad, are they not?He assented.And you admit that gentlemen tell things as they are.I do.Then, Ctesippus, good people speak evil of evil things, if they speak of them as they are.Yes, I can tell you, very much so, when for instance they speak of evil men;  among whom, if you take my advice,\nyou will beware of being included, that the good may not speak ill of you.  For, I assure you, the good speak ill of the evil.And they speak greatly of the great, asked Euthydemus, and hotly of the hot?Certainly, I presume, said Ctesippus:  I know they speak frigidly of the frigid, and call their way of arguing frigid.You are turning abusive, Ctesippus, said Dionysodorus, quite abusive!Not I, on my soul, Dionysodorus, for I like you:  I am only giving you a friendly hint, and endeavoring to persuade you never to say anything so tactless in my presence as\nthat I wish these my most highly valued friends to be dead and gone.So then I, observing that they were getting rather savage with each other, began to poke fun. at Ctesippus, saying:  Ctesippus, my feeling is that we ought to accept from our visitors what they tell us, if they are so good as to give it, and should not quarrel over a word.  For if they understand how to do away with people in such sort as to change them from wicked and witless to honest and intelligent, and that too whether they have discovered for themselves\nor learnt from somebody else this peculiar kind of destruction or undoing, which enables them to destroy a man in his wickedness and set him up again in honesty;  if they understand thisand obviously they do;  you know they said that their newly discovered art was to turn wicked men into goodlet us then accord them this power;  let them destroy the lad for us, and make him sensible, and all the rest of us likewise.  If you young fellows are afraid, let the experiment be made on me\nas a corpus vile;  for I, being an elderly person, am ready to take the risk and put myself in the hands of Dionysodorus here, as if he were the famous Medea of .  Let him destroy me, and if he likes let him boil me down, or do to me whatever he pleases:  only he must make me good.Then Ctesippus said:  I too, Socrates, am ready to offer myself to be skinned by the strangers even more, if they choose, than they are doing now, if my hide\nis not to end by being made into a wine-skin, like that of Marsyas, but into the shape of virtue.  And yet Dionysodorus here believes I am vexed with him.  I am not vexed at all;  I only contradict the remarks which I think he has improperly aimed at me.  Come now, my generous Dionysodorus, do not call contradiction abuse:  abuse is quite another thing.On this Dionysodorus said:  As though there were such a thing as contradiction!  Is that the way you argue, Ctesippus?Yes, to be sure, he replied, indeed I do;  and do you, Dionysodorus,\nhold that there is not?Well, you at any rate, he said, could not prove that you had ever heard a single person contradicting another.Is that so? he replied:  well, let us hear now whether I can prove a case of itCtesippus contradicting Dionysodorus.Now, will you make that good?Certainly, he said.Well then, proceeded the other, each thing that is has its own description?Certainly.Then do you mean,\nas each is, or as it is not?As it is.Yes, he said, for if you recollect, Ctesippus, we showed just now that no one speaks of a thing as it is not;  since we saw that no one speaks what is not.Well, what of that? asked Ctesippus:  are you and I contradicting any the less?Now tell me, he said, could we contradict if we both spoke the description of the same thing?  In this case should we not surely speak the same words?He agreed.But when neither of us speaks the description of the thing, he asked,\nthen we should contradict?  Or in this case shall we say that neither of us touched on the matter at all?This also he admitted.Well now, when I for my part speak the description of the thing, while you give another of another thing, do we contradict then?  Or do I describe the thing, while you do not describe it at all?  How can he who does not describe contradict him who does?At this Ctesippus was silent;  but I, wondering at the argument, said:  How do you mean, Dionysodorus? \nFor, to be plain with you, this argument, though I have heard it from many people on various occasions, never fails to set me wonderingyou know the followers of Protagoras made great use of it, as did others even before his time, but to me it always seems to have a wonderful way of upsetting not merely other views but itself alsoand I believe I shall learn the truth of it from you far better than from anyone else.  There is no such thing as speaking falsethat is the substance of your statement, is it not?  Either one must speak and speak the truth, or else not speak?He agreed.\n Then shall we say that speaking false is not, but thinking false is?No, it is the same with thinking, he said.So neither is there any false opinion, I said, at all.No, he said.Nor ignorance, nor ignorant men;  or must not ignorance occur, if it ever can, when we put things falsely?Certainly, he said.But there is no such thing as this, I said.No, he said.Is it merely to save your statement, Dionysodorus, that you state it sojust to say something startlingor is it really and truly your view that there is no such thing as an ignorant man?\n But you, he replied, are to refute me.Well, does your argument allow of such a thing as refutation, if there is nobody to speak false?There is no such thing, said Euthydemus.So neither did Dionysodorus just now bid me refute him? I asked.No, for how can one bid something that is not? Do you bid such a thing?Well, Euthydemus, I said, it is because I do not at all understand these clever devices and palpable hits:  I am only a dull sort of thinker.  And so I may perhaps be going to say something rather clownish;  but you must forgive me.  Here it is: \nif there is no such thing as speaking false or thinking false or being stupid, surely there can be no making a mistake either, when one does something.  For in doing it there is no mistaking the thing that is done.  You will state it so, will you not?Certainly, he said.My clownish question, I went on, is now already before you.  If we make no mistake either in doing or saying or intending, I ask you what in Heaven's name, on that assumption, is the subject you two set up to teach.  Or did you not say just now that your speciality was to put any man who wished\nin the way of learning virtue?Now really, Socrates, interposed Dionysodorus, are you such an old dotard as to recollect now what we said at first, and will you now recollect what I may have said last year, and yet be at a loss how to deal with the arguments urged at the moment?Well, you see, I replied, they are so very hard, and naturally so;  for they fall from the lips of wise men;  and this is further shown by the extreme difficulty of dealing with this last one you put forward.  For what on earth do you mean, Dionysodorus, by saying I am at a loss how to deal with it?  Or is it clear that\nyou mean I am at a loss how to refute it?  You must tell me what else your phrase can intend, at a loss how to deal with the arguments.But it is not so very hard to deal with that phrase of yours, he said.  Just answer me.Before you answer me, Dionysodorus?  I protested.You refuse to answer? he said.Is it fair?Oh yes, it is fair enough, he repliedOn what principle? I asked:  or is it plainly on this onethat you present yourself to us at this moment as universally skilled in discussion, and thus can tell when an answer is to be given, and when not?  So now you will not answer a word,\nbecause you discern that you ought not to.What nonsense you talk, he said, instead of answering as you should.  Come, good sir, do as I bid you and answer, since you confess to my wisdom.Well then, I must obey, I said, and of necessity, it seems;  for you are the master here.  Now for your question.Then tell me, do things that intend have life when they intend, or do lifeless things do it too?Only those that have life.Now do you know any phrase that has life?Upon my soul, I do not.\n Why then did you ask just now what my phrase intended?Of course I made a great mistake, I said:  I am such a dullard.  Or perhaps it was not a mistake, and I was right in saying what I did, that phrases intend.  Do you say I was mistaken or not?  If I was not, then you will not refute me, with all your skill, and you are at a loss how to deal with the argument;  while if I was mistaken, you are in the wrong there, too,\nfor you assert that there is no such thing as making a mistake;  and what I say is not aimed at what you said last year.  But it seems, I went on, Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, that our argument remains just where it was, and still suffers from the old trouble of knocking others down and then falling itself, and even your art has not yet discovered a way of avoiding this failurein spite, too, of the wonderful show it makes of accurate reasoning.Here Ctesippus exclaimed:  Yes, your way of discussion is marvellous,\nyou men of  or  or wherever or however it is you are pleased to get your names;  for you have no scruple about babbling like fools.At this I was afraid we might hear some abuse, so I soothed Ctesippus down once more, saying:  Ctesippus, I repeat to you what I said to Cleinias just now, that you do not perceive the wonderful nature of our visitors' skill.  Only they are unwilling to give us a display of it in real earnest, but treat us to jugglers' tricks in the style of Proteus the Egyptian adept. \nSo let us take our cue from Menelaus, and not leave hold of these gentlemen till they give us a sight of their own serious business.  I believe something very fine will be found in them as soon as they begin to be serious.  Come, let us beg and exhort and beseech them to let their light shine.  For my part, then, I am minded to take the lead once more in showing what sort of persons I pray may be revealed in them: \nstarting from where I left off before, I shall try, as best I can, to describe what follows on from that, to see if I can rouse them to action and make them, in merciful commensuration of my earnest endeavor, be earnest themselves.Will you, Cleinias, I asked, please remind me of the point at which we left off?  Now, as far as I can tell, it was something like this:  we ended by agreeing that one ought to pursue wisdom, did we not?Yes, he said.And this pursuitcalled philosophyis an acquiring of knowledge.  Is it not so? I asked.Yes, he said.Then what knowledge should we acquire if we acquired it rightly? \nIs it not absolutely clear that it must be that knowledge which will profit us?Certainly, he said.Now will it profit us at all, if we know how to tell, as we go about, where the earth has most gold buried in it?Perhaps, he said.But yet, I went on, we refuted that former proposition, agreeing that even if without any trouble or digging the earth we got all the gold in the world, we should gain nothing, so that not if we knew how\nto turn the rocks into gold would our knowledge be of any worth.  For unless we know how to use the gold, we found no advantage in it.  Do you not remember? I asked.Certainly I do, he said.Nor, it seems, do we get any advantage from all other knowledge, whether of money-making or medicine or any other that knows how to make things, without knowing how to use the thing made.  Is it not so?He agreed.Nor again, if there is a knowledge\nenabling one to make men immortal, does this, if we lack the knowledge how to use immortality, seem to bring any advantage either, if we are to infer anything from our previous admissions.On all these points we agreed.Then the sort of knowledge we require, fair youth, I said, is that in which there happens to be a union of making and knowing how to use the thing made.Apparently, he said.So we ought, it seems, to aim at something far other than being lyre-makers\nor possessing that kind of knowledge.  For in this case the art that makes and the art that uses are quite distinct, dealing in separation with the same thing;  since there is a wide difference between the art of making lyres and that of harp-playing.  Is it not so?He agreed.Nor again, obviously, do we require an art of flute-making;  for this is another of the same kind.He assented.Now in good earnest, I asked, if we were to learn the art of speech-making, can that be the art we should acquire if we would be happy?I for one think not, said Cleinias, interposing.   \n On what proof do you rely? I asked.I see, he said, certain speech-writers who do not know how to use the special arguments composed by themselves, just as lyre-makers in regard to their lyres:  in the former case also there are other persons able to use what the makers produced, while being themselves unable to make the written speech.  Hence it is clear that in speech likewise there are two distinct arts, one of making and one of using.I think you give sufficient proof, I said, that this art of the speech-writers cannot be that whose acquisition would make one happy.  And yet I fancied that somewhere about this point would appear the knowledge which we have been seeking all this while. \nFor not only do these speech-writers themselves, when I am in their company, impress me as prodigiously clever, Cleinias, but their art itself seems so exalted as to be almost inspired.  However, this is not surprising;  for it is a part of the sorcerer's art,\nand only slightly inferior to that.  The sorcerer's art is the charming of snakes and tarantulas and scorpions and other beasts and diseases, while the other is just the charming and soothing of juries, assemblies, crowds, and so forth.  Or does it strike you differently? I asked.No, it appears to me, he replied, to be as you say.Which way then, said I, shall we turn now?  What kind of art shall we try?For my part, he said, I have no suggestion.Why, I think I have found it myself, I said.What is it? said Cleinias.\n Generalship, I replied, strikes me as the art whose acquisition above all others would make one happy.I do not think so.Why not? I asked.In a sense, this is an art of hunting men.What then? I said.No part of actual hunting, he replied, covers more than the province of chasing and overcoming;  and when they have overcome the creature they are chasing, they are unable to use it:  the huntsmen or the fishermen hand it over to the caterers, and so it is too with the geometers, astronomers, and calculators\nfor these also are hunters in their way, since they are not in each case diagram-makers, but discover the realities of thingsand so, not knowing how to use their prey, but only how to hunt, I take it they hand over their discoveries to the dialecticians to use properly, those of them, at least, who are not utter blockheads.Very good, I said, most handsome and ingenious Cleinias;  and is this really so?To be sure it is;  and so, in the same way, with the generals.  When they have hunted either a city or\nan army, they hand it over to the politicianssince they themselves do not know how to use what they have huntedjust as quail-hunters, I suppose, hand over their birds to the quail-keepers.  If, therefore, he went on, we are looking for that art which itself shall know how to use what it has acquired either in making or chasing, and if this is the sort that will make us blest, we must reject generalship, he said, and seek out some other."}}, {"speaker": "Crito", "p": "What is this, Socrates?

This will be much easier than learning foraman of my age.Come then, answer me this, he said:  Do you know anything?Yes, indeed, I replied. and many things, though trifles.That is enough, he said;  now do you think it possible that anything that is should not be just that which it actually is?On my soul, not I.\n Now you, he said, know something?I do.Then you are knowing, if you really know?Certainly, in just that something.That makes no difference;  you are not under a necessity of knowing everything, if you are knowing?No, to be sure, I replied;  for there are many other things which I do not know.Then if you do not know something, you are not knowing?Not in that thing, my dear sir, I replied.Are you therefore any the less unknowing?  Just now you said you were knowing; \nso here you are, actually the very man that you are, and again, not that man, in regard to the same matter and at the same time!Admitted, Euthydemus, I said:  as the saying goes, well said whate'er you say.  How therefore do I know that knowledge which we were seeking?  Since forsooth it is impossible for the same thing to be so and not be so;  by knowing one thing I know all;for I could not be at once both knowing and unknowing;and as I know everything I have that knowledge to boot:  is that your line of argument?  Is this your wisdom?\n Yes, you see, Socrates, he said, your own words refute you.Well, but, Euthydemus, I continued, are you not in the same plight?  I assure you, so long as I had you and this dear fellow Dionysodorus to share my lot, however hard, I should have nothing to complain of.  Tell me, you both know some existent things, of course, and others you do not?By no means, Socrates, said Dionysodorus.How do you mean? I asked:  do you then not know anything?Oh yes, we do, he said.\n So you know everything, I asked, since you know anything?Everything, he replied;  yes, and you too, if you know one thing, know all.Good Heavens, I cried, what a wonderful statement!  What a great blessing to boast of!  And the rest of mankind, do they know everything or nothing?Surely, he said, they cannot know some things and not others, and so be at once knowing and unknowing.But what then? I asked.All men, he replied, know all things, if they know one.In the name of goodness,\nDionysodorus, I saidfor now I can see both of you are serious;  before, I could hardly prevail on you to be sodo you yourselves really know everything?  Carpentry, for instance, and shoe-making?Certainly, he said.And you are good hands at leather-stitching?Why yes, in faith, and cobbling, he said.And are you good also at such things as counting the stars, and the sand?Certainly, he said:  can you think we would not admit that also?Here Ctesippus broke in:  Be so good,\nDionysodorus, he said, as to place some such evidence before me as will convince me that what you say is true.What shall I put forward? he asked.Do you know how many teeth Euthydemus has, and does Euthydemus know how many you have?Are you not content, he rejoined, to be told that we know everything?No, do not say that, he replied:  only tell us this one thing more, and propound to us that you speak the truth.  Then, if you tell us how many teeth each of you has, and you are found by our counting to have known it, we shall believe you thenceforth in everything else likewise.\n Well, as they supposed we were making fun of them, they would not do it:  only they agreed that they knew all subjects, when questioned on them, one after the other, by Ctesippus;  who, before he had done with them, asked them if they knew every kind of thing, even the most unseemly, without the least reserve;  while they most valiantly encountered his questions, agreeing that they had the knowledge in each case, like boars when driven up to face the spears:  so that I for my part, Crito, became quite incredulous,and had to ask in the end if Dionysodorus knew\nalso how to dance.  To which he replied:  Certainly.I do not suppose, I said, that you have attained such a degree of skill as to do sword-dancing, or be whirled about on a wheel, at your time of life?There is nothing, he said, that I cannot do.Then tell me, I went on, do you know everything at present only, or for ever?For ever too, he said.And when you were children, and were just born, you knew?Everything, they both replied together.\n Now, to us the thing seemed incredible:  then Euthydemus said:  You do not believe it, Socrates?I will only say, I replied, that you must indeed be clever.Why, he said, if you will consent to answer me, I will propound that you too admit these surprising facts.Oh, I am only too glad, I replied, to be refuted in the matter.  For if I am not aware of my own cleverness, and you are going to show me that I know everything always, what greater stroke of luck than this could befall me in all my living days?Then answer me, he said.Ask:  I am ready to answer.\n Well then, Socrates, he asked, have you knowledge of something, or not?I have.And tell me, do you know with that whereby you have knowledge, or with something else?With that whereby I have knowledge:  I think you mean the soul, or is not that your meaning?Are you not ashamed, Socrates, he said, to ask a question on your side when you are being questioned?Very well, I said:  but how am I to proceed?  I will do just as you bid me.  When I cannot tell what you are asking, is it your order that I answer all the same, without asking a question upon it?Why, he replied, you surely conceive\nsome meaning in what I say?I do, I replied.Answer then to the meaning you conceive to be in my words.Well, I said, if you ask a question with a different meaning in your mind from that which I conceive, and I answer to the latter, are you content I should answer nothing to the point?For my part, he replied, I shall be content:  you, however, will not, so far as I can see.Then I declare I shall not answer, I said, before I get it right.You refuse to answer, he said, to the meaning you conceive in each case,\nbecause you will go on driveling, you hopeless old dotard!Here I perceived he was annoyed with me for distinguishing between the phrases used, when he wanted to entrap me in his verbal snares.  So I remembered Connus, how he too is annoyed with me whenever I do not give in to him, with the result that he now takes less trouble over me as being a stupid person.  So being minded to take lessons from this new teacher, I decided that I had better give in, lest he should take me for a blockhead and not admit me to his classes.  So I said:  Well, if you think fit, Euthydemus,\nto proceed thus, we must do so;  in any case I suppose you understand debating better than I doyou are versed in the method, and I am but a layman.  Begin your questions, then, over again.Now, answer me once more, he said:  do you know what you know by means of something, or not?I do, I replied;  by means of my soul.\n There he is again, he said, answering more than he is asked.  For I am not asking what the means is, but only whether you know by some means.Yes, I did again answer more than I ought, I said, through lack of education.  But forgive me, and I will now simply reply that I know what I know by some means.By one and the same means always, he asked, or sometimes by one and sometimes by another?Always, whenever I know, I replied, it is by this means.There again, he cried, you really must stop adding these qualifications.\n But I am so afraid this word always may bring us to grief.Not us, he rejoined, but, if anyone, you.  Now answer:  do you know by this means always?Always, I, replied, since I must withdraw the whenever.Then you always know by this means:  that being the case, do you know some things by this means of knowing, and some things by another means, or everything by this?Everything by this, I replied;  everything, that is, that I know.There it comes again, he cried;  the same qualification!Well, I withdraw my that is, that I know.No, do not withdraw a single word, he said:  I ask you for no concession. \nOnly answer me:  could you know all things if you did not know everything?It would be most surprising, I said.Then he went on:  You may therefore add on now whatever you please:  for you admit that you know all things.It seems I do, I replied, seeing that my that I know has no force, and I know everything.Now you have also admitted that you know always by the means whereby you know, whenever you knowor however you like to put it.  For you have admitted that you always know and, at the same time, everything.  Hence it is clear that\neven as a child you knew, both when you were being born and when you were being conceived:  and before you yourself came into being or heaven and earth existed, you knew all things, since you always know.  Yes, and I declare, he said, you yourself will always know all things, if it be my pleasure.Oh, pray let it be your pleasure, I replied, most worshipful Euthydemus, if what you say is really true.  Only I do not quite trust in your efficacy, if your pleasure is not to he also that of your brother here, Dionysodorus:  if it is, you will probably prevail.  And tell me, I went on,\nsince I cannot hope in a general way to dispute the statement that I know everything with persons so prodigiously cleversince it is your statementhow am I to say I know certain things, Euthydemus;  for instance, that good men are unjust?  Come, tell me, do I know this or not?You know it certainly, he said.   What? I said.   That the good are not unjust.Quite so, I said:  I knew that all the time;  but that is not what I ask: \ntell me, where did I learn that the good are unjust?Nowhere, said Dionysodorus.Then I do not know this, I said.You are spoiling the argument, said Euthydemus to Dionysodorus, and we shall find that this fellow does not know, and is at once both knowing and unknowing.At this Dionysodorus reddened.  But you, I said, what do you mean, Euthydemus. \nDo you find that your brother, who knows everything, has not spoken aright?I a brother of Euthydemus? quickly interposed Dionysodorus.Whereupon I said:  Let me alone, good sir, till Euthydemus has taught me that I know that good men are unjust, and do not grudge me this lesson.You are running away, Socrates, said Dionysodorus;  you refuse to answer.Yes, and with good reason, I said:  for I am weaker than\neither one of you, so I have no scruple about running away from the two together.  You see, I am sadly inferior to Hercules, who was no match for the hydrathat she-professor who was so clever that she sent forth many heads of debate in place of each one that was cut off;  nor for another sort of, crab-professor from the sea freshly, I fancy, arrived on shore;  and, when the hero was so bothered with its leftward barks and bites, he summoned his nephew Iolaus to the rescue,\nand he brought him effective relief.  But if my Iolaus were to come, he would do more harm than good.Well, answer this, said Dionysodorus, now you have done your descanting:  Was Iolaus more Hercules' nephew than yours?I see I had best answer you, Dionysodorus, I said.  For you will never cease putting questionsI think I may say I am sure of thisin a grudging, obstructing spirit, so that Euthydemus may not teach me that bit of cleverness.Then answer, he said.Well, I answer, I said, that Iolaus was Hercules' nephew, but not mine,\nso far as I can see, in any way whatever.  For Patrocles, my brother, was not his father;  only Hercules' brother Iphicles had a name somewhat similar to his.And Patrocles, he said, is your brother?Certainly, I said:  that is, by the same mother, but not by the same father.Then he is your brother and not your brother.Not by the same father, worthy sir, I replied.  His father was Chaeredemus, mine Sophroniscus.So Sophroniscus and Chaeredemus, he said, were father?Certainly, I said:  the former mine,\nthe latter his.  Then surely, he went on, Chaeredemus was other than father?Than mine, at any rate, I said.Why then, he was father while being other than father.  Or are you the same as the stone?I fear you may prove that of me, I said, though I do not feel like it.Then are you other than the stone?Other, I must say.Then of course, he went on, if you are other than stone, you are not stone?  And if you are other than gold, you are not gold?Quite so.Hence Chaeredemus, he said, being other than father,\ncannot be father.It seems, I said, that he is not a father.No, for I presume, interposed Euthydemus, that if Chaeredemus is a father Sophroniscus in his turn, being other than a father, is not a father;  so that you, Socrates, are fatherless.Here Ctesippus took it up, observing:  And your father too, is he not in just the same plight?  Is he other than my father?Not in the slightest, said Euthydemus.What, asked the other, is he the same?The same, to be sure.I should not like to think he was:  but tell me, Euthydemus,\nis he my father only, or everybody else's too?Everybody else's too, he replied;  or do you suppose that the same man, being a father, can be no father?I did suppose so, said Ctesippus.Well, said the other, and that a thing being gold could be not gold?  Or being a man, not man?Perhaps, Euthydemus, said Ctesippus, you are knotting flax with cotton, as they say:  for it is a strange result that you state, if your father is father of all.He is, though, was the reply.Of all men, do you mean? asked Ctesippus, or of horses too,\nand all other animals?Of all, he said.And is your mother a mother in the same way?My mother too.And is your mother a mother of sea-urchins?Yes, and yours is also, he replied.So then you are a brother of the gudgeons and whelps and porkers.Yes, and so are you, he said.Then your father is a boar and a dog.And so is yours, he said.Yes, said Dionysodorus, and it will take you but a moment, if you will answer me, Ctesippus, to acknowledge all this.  Just tell me, have you a dog?Yes, a real rogue, said Ctesippus.   \n Has he got puppies?Yes, a set of rogues like him.Then is the dog their father?Yes, indeed;  I saw him with my own eyes covering the bitch.Well now, is not the dog yours?Certainly, he said.Thus he is a father, and yours, and accordingly the dog turns out to be your father, and you a brother of whelps.Hereupon Dionysodorus struck in again quickly, lest Ctesippus should get a word in before him:  Answer me just one more little point:  do you beat this dog?Ctesippus laughed and said:  My word, yes;  since I cannot beat you!So you beat your own father?\nhe said.There would be much more justice, though, he replied, in my beating yours, for being so ill-advised as to beget clever sons like you.  Yet I doubt, Ctesippus went on, if your father, Euthydemusthe puppies' fatherhas derived much good from this wisdom of yours.Why, he has no need of much good, Ctesippus, neither he nor you.And have you no need either, yourself, Euthydemus? he asked.No, nor has any other man.  Just tell me, Ctesippus,\nwhether you think it good for a sick man to drink physic when he wants it, or whether you consider it not good;  or for a man to go to the wars with arms rather than without them.With them, I think, he replied:  and yet I believe you are about to utter one of your pleasantries.You will gather that well enough, he said:  only answer me.  Since you admit that physic is good for a man to drink when necessary, surely one ought to drink this good thing as much as possible;  and in such a case it will be well to pound and infuse in it a cart-load of hellebore?To this Ctesippus replied:  Quite so,\nto be sure, Euthydemus, at any rate if the drinker is as big as the Delphian statue.Then, further, since in war, he proceeded, it is good to have arms, one ought to have as many spears and shields as possible, if we agree that it is a good thing?Yes, I suppose, said Ctesippus and you, Euthydemus, do you take the other view, that it should be one shield and one spear?Yes, I do.What, he said, and would you arm Geryon also and Briareus in this way?  I thought you more of an expert than that, considering you are a man-at-arms, and your comrade here too!At this Euthydemus was silent;  then Dionysodorus\nasked some questions on Ctesippus' previous answers, saying:  Well now, gold is in your opinion a good thing to have?Certainly, andhere I agreeplenty of it too, said Ctesippus.Well then, do you not think it right to have good things always and everywhere?Assuredly, he said.Then do you admit that gold is also a good?Why, I have admitted it, he replied.Then we ought always to have it, and everywhere, and above all, in oneself? \nAnd one will be happiest if one has three talents of gold in one's belly, a talent in one's skull, and a stater of gold in each eye?Well, Euthydemus, replied Ctesippus, they say that among the Scythians those are the happiest and best men who have a lot of gold in their own skullssomewhat as you were saying a moment ago that dog is father;  and a still more marvellous thing is told, how they drink out of their skulls when gilded, and gaze inside them, holding their own headpiece in their hands.Tell me, said Euthydemus,\ndo the Scythians and men in general see things possible of sight, or things impossible?Possible, I presume.And you do so too?I too.Then you see our cloaks?Yes.And have they power of sight?Quite extraordinarily, said Ctesippus.What do they see? he asked.Nothing.  Perhaps you do not think they seeyou are such a sweet innocent.  I should say, Euthydemus, that you have fallen asleep with your eyes open and, if it be possible to speak and at the same time say nothing,\nthat this is what you are doing.Why, asked Dionysodorus, may there not be a speaking of the silent?By no means whatever, replied Ctesippus.Nor a silence of speaking?Still less, he said.Now, when you speak of stones and timbers and irons, are you not speaking of the silent?Not if I walk by a smithy, for there, as they say, the irons speak and cry aloud, when they are touched;  so here your wisdom has seduced you into nonsense.  But come, you have still to propound me your second point,\nhow on the other hand there may be a silence of speaking.  (It struck me that Ctesippus was specially excited on account of his young friend's presence.)When you are silent, said Euthydemus, are you not making a silence of all things?Yes, he replied.Then it is a silence of speaking things also, if the speaking are among all things.What, said Ctesippus, are not all things silent?I presume not, said Euthydemus.But then, my good sir, do all things speak?Yes, I suppose, at least those that speak.But that is not what I ask, he said:  are all things silent or do they speak?Neither and both,\nsaid Dionysodorus, snatching the word from him:  I am quite sure that is an answer that will baffle you!At this Ctesippus, as his manner was, gave a mighty guffaw, and said:  Ah, Euthydemus, your brother has made the argument ambiguous with his both, and is worsted and done for.Then Cleinias was greatly delighted and laughed, so that Ctesippus felt his strength was as the strength of ten:  but I fancy Ctesippushe is such a roguehad picked up these very words by overhearing the men themselves, since in nobody else of the present age is such wisdom to be found.\n So I remarked:  Why are you laughing, Cleinias, at such serious and beautiful things?What, have you, Socrates, ever yet seen a beautiful thing? asked Dionysodorus.Yes, I have, I replied, and many of them, Dionysodorus.Did you find them different from the beautiful, he said,\nor the same as the beautiful?Here I was desperately perplexed, and felt that I had my deserts for the grunt I had made:  however, I replied that they were different from the beautiful itself, though each of them had some beauty present with it.So if an ox is present with you, he said, you are an ox, and since I am now present with you, you are Dionysodorus.Heavens, do not say that! I cried.But in what way can one thing, by having a different thing present with it, be itself different?\n Are you at a loss there?  I asked:  already I was attempting to imitate the cleverness of these men, I was so eager to get it.Can I help being at a loss, he said, I and likewise everybody else in the world, in face of what cannot be?What is that you say, Dionysodorus? I asked:  is not the beautiful beautiful, and the ugly ugly?Yes, if it seems so to me, he replied.Then does it seem so?Certainly, he said.Then the same also is the same, and the different different?  For I presume the different cannot be the same;  nay, I thought\nnot even a child would doubt that the different is different.  But, Dionysodorus, you have deliberately passed over this one point;  though, on the whole, I feel that, like craftsmen finishing off each his special piece of work, you two are carrying out your disputation in excellent style.Well, he asked, do you know what is each craftsman's special piece of work?  First of all, whose proper task is it to forge brass?  Can you tell?I can:  a brazier's.Well, again, whose to make pots?A potter's.Once more, whose to slaughter and skin,\nand after cutting up the joints to stew and roast?A caterer's, I said.Now, if one does one's proper work, he said, one will do rightly?Yes, to be sure.And is it, as you say, the caterer's proper work to cut up and skin?  Did you admit this or not?I did so, I replied, but pray forgive me.It is clear then, he proceeded, that if someone slaughters the caterer and cuts him up, and then stews or roasts him, he will be doing his proper work;  and if he hammers the brazier himself, and moulds the potter, he will be doing his business likewise.\n Poseidon! I exclaimed, there you give the finishing touch to your wisdom.  I wonder if this skill could ever come to me in such manner as to be my very own.Would you recognize it, Socrates, he asked, if it came to be your own?Yes, if only you are agreeable, I replied, without a doubt.Why, he went on, do you imagine you perceive what is yours?Yes, if I take your meaning aright:  for all my hopes arise from you, and end In Euthydemus here.Then tell me, he asked, do you count those things yours which you control and are free to use as you please? \nFor instance, an ox or a sheep,would you count these as yours, if you were free to sell or bestow them, or sacrifice them to any god you chose?  And things which you could not treat thus are not yours?Hereupon, since I knew that some brilliant result was sure to bob up from the mere turn of the questions, and as I also wanted to hear it as quickly as possible, I said:  It is precisely as you say;  only such things are mine.Well now, he went on:  you call those things animals which have life?\n Yes, I said.And you admit that only those animals are yours which you are at liberty to deal with in those various ways that I mentioned just now?I admit that.Thenafter a very ironical pause, as though he were pondering some great matterhe proceeded:  Tell me, Socrates, have you an ancestral Zeus?Here I suspected the discussion was approaching the point at which it eventually ended, and so I tried what desperate wriggle I could to escape from the net in which I now felt myself entangled.  My answer was:  I have not, Dionysodorus.What a miserable fellow you must be,\nhe said, and no Athenian at all, if you have neither ancestral gods, nor shrines, nor anything else that denotes a gentleman!Enough, Dionysodorus;  speak fair words, and don't browbeat your pupil!  For I have altars and shrines, domestic and ancestral, and everything else of the sort that other Athenians have.Then have not other Athenians, he asked, their ancestral Zeus?None of the Ionians, I replied, give him this title, neither we nor those who have left this city to settle abroad:  they have an ancestral Apollo,\nbecause of Ion's parentage.  Among us the name ancestral is not given to Zeus, but that of houseward and tribal, and we have a tribal Athena.That will do, said Dionysodorus;  you have, it seems, Apollo and Zeus and Athena.Certainly, I said.Then these must be your gods? he said.My ancestors, I said, and lords.Well, at least, you have them, he said:  or have you not admitted they are yours?I have admitted it, I replied:  what else could I do?And are not these gods animals? he asked:  you know you have admitted\nthat whatever has life is an animal.  Or have these gods no life?They have, I replied.Then are they not animals?Yes, animals, I said.And those animals, he went on, you have admitted to be yours, which you are free to bestow and sell and sacrifice to any god you please.I have admitted it, I replied;  there is no escape for me, Euthydemus.Come then, tell me straight off, he said;  since you admit that Zeus and the other gods are yours, are you free to sell or\nbestow them or treat them just as you please, like the other animals?Well, Crito, here I must say I was knocked out, as it were, by the argument, and lay speechless;  then Ctesippus rushed to the rescue andBravo, Hercules! he cried, a fine argument!Whereat Dionysodorus asked:  Now, do you mean that Hercules is a bravo, or that bravo is Hercules?Ctesippus replied:  Poseidon, what a frightful use of words!  I give up the fight:  these two are invincible.\n Hereupon I confess, my dear Crito, that everyone present without exception wildly applauded the argument and the two men, till they all nearly died of laughing and clapping and rejoicing.  For their previous successes had been highly acclaimed one by one, but only by the devotees of Euthydemus;  whereas now almost the very pillars of the Lyceum took part in the joyful acclamations in honor of the pair.  For myself, I was quite disposed to admit that never had I set eyes\non such clever people, and I was so utterly enthralled by their skill that I betook myself to praising and congratulating them, and said:  Ah, happy pair!  What amazing genius, to acquire such a great accomplishment so quickly and in so short a time!  Among the many fine points in your arguments, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, there is one that stands out in particular magnificencethat you care not a jot for the multitude, or for any would-be important or famous people, but only for those of your own sort.  And I am perfectly sure that there are but a few persons\nlike yourselves who would be satisfied with these arguments:  the rest of the world regard them only as arguments with which, I assure you, they would feel it a greater disgrace to refute others than to be refuted themselves.  And further, there is at the same time a popular and kindly feature in your talk:  when you say there is nothing either beautiful, or good, or white, and so on, and no difference of things at all, in truth you simply stitch up men's mouths,\nas you expressly say you do;  while as to your apparent power of stitching up your own mouths as well, this is a piece of agreeable manners that takes off any offence from your talk.  But the greatest thing of all is, that this faculty of yours is such, and is so skilfully contrived, that anyone in the world may learn it of you in a very short time;  this fact I perceived myself by watching Ctesippus and observing how quickly he was able to imitate you on the spot.  Now, in so far as your accomplishment can be quickly imparted,\nit is excellent;  but for public discussions it is not suitable:  if I may advise you, beware of talking before a number of people, lest they learn the whole thing in a trice and give you no credit for it.  The best thing for you is to talk to each other by yourselves, in private;  failing that, if a third person is present, it must be someone who will pay you a good fee.  And if you are prudent\nyou will give this same counsel to your pupils alsothat they are never to converse with anybody except you and each other.  For it is the rare, Euthydemus, that is precious, while water is cheapest, though best, as Pindar said.  But come, I said, see if you can admit both me and Cleinias here to your class.This, Crito, was our conversation, and after exchanging a few more words we went off.  Now you must arrange to join us in taking lessons from the pair; \nfor they say they are able to teach anyone who is willing to pay good money, and that no sort of character or ageand it is well that you especially should be told that they promise that their art is no hindrance to money-makingneed deter anyone from an easy acquisition of their wisdom."}}, {"speaker": "Crito", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "304d", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "304e", "@unit": "section"}, {"@unit": "page", "@n": "305"}, {"@n": "305a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "305b", "@unit": "section"}], "note": {"@resp": "Loeb", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The allusion is probably to Isocrates."}, "#text": "Indeed, Socrates, I love listening, and would be glad to learn from them;  but I am afraid I am one of the sort who are not like Euthydemus, but who, as you described them just now, would prefer being refuted\nto refuting with such arguments. Now, although I feel it is absurd to admonish you, I wish nevertheless to report to you what was told me just now.  Do you know, one of the people who had left your discussion came up to me as I was taking a strolla man who thinks himself very wise, one of those who are so clever at turning out speeches for the law-courtsand said:  Crito, do you take no lessons from these wise men?  No, in truth, I replied:  there was such a crowd that, though I stood quite close, I was unable to catch what was said.  Well, let me tell you, he said, it was something worth hearing. \nWhat was it?  I asked.  You would have heard the disputation of men who are the most accomplished of our day in that kind of speaking.  To this I replied:  Well, what did they show forth to you?  Merely the sort of stuff, he said, that you may hear such people babbling about at any timemaking an inconsequent ado about matters of no consequence (in some such parlance he expressed himself).  WhereuponWell, all the same, I said, philosophy is a charming thing. Charming is it, my dear innocent? he exclaimed: \nnay, a thing of no consequence. Why, had you been in that company just now, you would have been filled with shame, I fancy, for your particular friend:  he was so strangely willing to lend himself to persons who care not a straw what they say, but merely fasten on any phrase that turns up.  And these, as I said just now, are the heads of their profession today.  But the fact is, Crito, he went on, the business itself and the people who follow it are worthless and ridiculous.  Now, in my opinion, Socrates, lie was not right in decrying the pursuit: \nhe is wrong, and so is anyone else who decries it:  though I must say I felt he was right in blaming the readiness to engage in discussion with such people before a large company."}}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": {"milestone": {"@n": "305c", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "Crito, these people are very odd.

Hence they believe that, if they can reduce the latter to a status of no esteem, the prize of victory will by common consent be awarded to them, without dispute or delay, and their claim to wisdom will be won.  For they consider themselves to be in very truth the wisest, but find that, when caught in private conversation, they are cut off short by Euthydemus and his set.

During this night just past, in the small hours, Hippocrates, son of Apollodorus and brother of Phason, knocked violently at my door with his stick,\nand when they opened to him he came hurrying in at once and calling to me in a loud voice:  Socrates, are you awake, or sleeping?  Then I, recognizing his voice, said:  Hippocrates, hallo!  Some news to break to me?  Only good news, he replied.  Tell it, and welcome, I said:  what is it, and what business brings you here at such an hour?  Protagoras has come, he said, standing at my side.  Yes, two days ago, I said:  have you only just heard?  Yes, by Heaven!  he replied,\nlast evening.  With this he groped about for the bedstead, and sitting down by my feet he said:  It was in the evening, after I had got in very late from Oenoe.  My boy Satyrus, you see, had run away:  I meant to let you know I was going in chase of him, but some other matter put it out of my head.  On my return, when we had finished dinner and were about to retire, my brother told me, only then, that Protagoras had come.  I made an effort, even at that hour, to get to you at once, but came to the conclusion that it was too late at night.\nBut as soon as I had slept off my fatigue I got up at once and made my way straight here.  Then I, noting the man's gallant spirit and the flutter he was in, remarked:  Well, what is that to you?  Has Protagoras wronged you?  At this he laughed and, Yes, by the gods!  he said, by being the only wise man, and not making me one.  But, by Zeus!  I said, if you give him a fee and win him over he will make you wise too.  Would to Zeus and all the gods, he exclaimed,\nonly that were needed!  I should not spare either my own pocket or those of my friends.  But it is on this very account I have come to you now, to see if you will have a talk with him on my behalf:  for one thing, I am too young to do it myself;  and for another, I have never yet seen Protagoras nor heard him speak a wordI was but a child when he paid us his previous visit.  You know, Socrates, how everyone praises the man and tells of his mastery of speech:  let us step over to him at once,\nto make sure of finding him in;  he is staying, so I was told, with Callias, son of Hipponicus.  Now, let us be going.  To this I replied:  We had better not go there yet, my good friend, it is so very early:  let us rise and turn into the court here, and spend the time strolling there till daylight comes;  after that we can go.  Protagoras, you see, spends most of his time indoors, so have no fear, we shall find him in all right, most likely.So then we got up and strolled in the court;\nand I, to test Hippocrates' grit, began examining him with a few questions.  Tell me, Hippocrates, I said, in your present design of going to Protagoras and paying him money as a fee for his services to yourself, to whom do you consider you are resorting, and what is it that you are to become?  Suppose, for example, you had taken it into your head to call on your namesake Hippocrates of Cos, the Asclepiad, and pay him money as your personal fee, and suppose someone asked youTell me, Hippocrates, in purposing to pay\na fee to Hippocrates, what do you consider him to be?  How would you answer that?A doctor, I would say.And what would you intend to become?A doctor, he replied.And suppose you had a mind to approach Polycleitus the  or Pheidias the Athenian and pay them a personal fee, and somebody asked youWhat is it that you consider Polycleitus or Pheidias to be, that you are minded to pay them this money?  What would your answer be to that?Sculptors, I would reply. And what would you intend to become?   Obviously, a sculptor.Very well then, I said;  you and I will go now to Protagoras,\nprepared to pay him money as your fee,from our own means if they are adequate for the purpose of prevailing on him, but if not, then drawing on our friends' resources to make up the sum.  Now if anyone, observing our extreme earnestness in the matter, should ask us,Pray, Socrates and Hippocrates, what is it that you take Protagoras to be, when you purpose to pay him money?  What should we reply to him?  What is the other name that we commonly hear attached to Protagoras?  They call Pheidias a sculptor and Homer a poet:\nwhat title do they give Protagoras?A sophist, to be sure, Socrates, is what they call him.Then we go to him and pay him the money as a sophist?Certainly.Now suppose someone asked you this further question:\nAnd what is it that you yourself hope to become when you go to Protagoras ?To this he replied with a blushfor by then there was a glimmer of daylight by which I could see him quite clearlyIf it is like the previous cases, obviously, to become a sophist.In Heaven's name, I said, would you not be ashamed to present yourself before the Greeks as a sophist?Yes, on my soul I should, Socrates, if I am to speak my real thoughts.Yet after all, Hippocrates, perhaps it is not this sort of learning that you expect to get from Protagoras, but rather the sort you had\nfrom your language-master, your harp-teacher, and your sports-instructor;  for when you took your lessons from each of these it was not in the technical way, with a view to becoming a professional, but for education, as befits a private gentleman.I quite agree, he said it is rather this kind of learning that one gets from Protagoras.Then are you aware what you are now about to do, or is it not clear to you?  I asked.To what do you refer?I mean your intention of submitting your soul\nto the treatment of a man who, as you say, is a sophist;  and as to what a sophist really is, I shall be surprised if you can tell me.  And yet, if you are ignorant of this, you cannot know to whom you are entrusting your soul,whether it is to something good or to something evil.I really think, he said, that I know.Then tell me, please, what you consider a sophist to be.I should say, he replied, from what the name implies, that he is one who has knowledge of wise matters.Well, I went on, we are able to say this of painters also, and of carpenters,that they are the persons who have knowledge of wise matters;\nand if someone asked us for what those matters are wise, of which painters have knowledge, I suppose we should tell him that they are wise for the production of likenesses, and similarly with the rest.  But if he should ask for what the matters of the sophist are wise, how should we answer him?  What sort of workmanship is he master of?How should we describe him, Socrates,as a master of making one a clever speaker?Perhaps, I replied, we should be speaking the truth, but yet not all the truth;  for our answer still calls for a question, as to the subject on which the   sophist makes one a clever speaker:  just as the harp player\nmakes one clever, I presume, at speaking on the matter of which he gives one knowledge, namely harp-playing,you agree to that?Yes.Well, about what does the sophist make one a clever speaker?Clearly it must be the same thing as that of which he gives one knowledge.So it would seem:  now what is this thing, of which the sophist himself has knowledge and gives knowledge to his pupil?Ah, there, in good faith, he said, I fail to find you an answer.\nI then went on to say:  Now tell me, are you aware upon what sort of hazard you are going to stake your soul?  If you had to entrust your body to someone, taking the risk of its being made better or worse, you would first consider most carefully whether you ought to entrust it or not, and would seek the advice of your friends and relations and ponder it for a number of days:  but in the case of your soul, which you value much more highly than your body, and on which depends the good or ill condition of all your affairs, according as it is made better or worse, would you omit to consult first with either your father\nor your brother or one of us your comrades,as to whether or no you should entrust your very soul to this newly-arrived foreigner;  but choose rather, having heard of him in the evening, as you say, and coming to me at dawn, to make no mention of this question, and take no counsel upon itwhether you ought to entrust yourself to him or not;  and are ready to spend your own substance and that of your friends, in the settled conviction that at all costs you must converse with Protagoras, whom you neither know, as you tell me, nor have ever met in argument before,\nand whom you call sophist, in patent ignorance of what this sophist may be to whom you are about to entrust yourself?When he heard this he said:  It seems so, Socrates, by what you say.Then can it be, Hippocrates, that the sophist is really a sort of merchant or dealer in provisions on which a soul is nourished?  For such is the view I take of him.With what, Socrates, is a soul nourished?With doctrines, presumably, I replied.  And we must take care, my good friend, that the sophist, in commending his wares, does not deceive us, as both merchant and dealer do in the case of our bodily food.\nFor among the provisions, you know, in which these men deal, not only are they themselves ignorant what is good or bad for the body, since in selling they commend them all, but the people who buy from them are so too, unless one happens to be a trainer or a doctor.  And in the same way, those who take their doctrines the round of our cities, hawking them about to any odd purchaser who desires them, commend everything that they sell, and there may well be some of these too, my good sir, who are ignorant which of their wares is\ngood or bad for the soul;  and in just the same case are the people who buy from them, unless one happens to have a doctor's knowledge here also, but of the soul.  So then, if you are well informed as to what is good or bad among these wares, it will be safe for you to buy doctrines from Protagoras or from anyone else you please:  but if not, take care, my dear fellow, that you do not risk your greatest treasure on a toss of the dice.\n For I tell you there is far more serious risk in the purchase of doctrines than in that of eatables.  When you buy victuals and liquors you can carry them off from the dealer or merchant in separate vessels, and before you take them into your body by drinking or eating you can lay them in your house and take the advice of an expert whom you can call in, as to what is fit to eat or drink and what is not, and how much you should take and when;  so that in this purchase the risk is not serious.\nBut you cannot carry away doctrines in a separate vessel:  you are compelled, when you have handed over the price, to take the doctrine in your very soul by learning it, and so to depart either an injured or a benefited man.  These, then, are questions which we have to consider with the aid of our elders, since we ourselves are still rather young to unravel so great a matter.  For the moment, however, let us pursue our design and go and hear this person;  and when we have heard him we shall proceed to consult others:  for Protagoras is not the only one there;  we shall find Hippias of \nand, I believe, Prodicus of , and numerous other men of wisdom besides.This we resolved on, and set forth;  and when we arrived at the doorway, we stood discussing some question or other that had occurred to us by the way:  so, not to leave it unfinished, but to get it settled before we went in, we stood there and discussed in front of the door, until we had come to an agreement with each other.  Now, I fancy the doorkeeper, who was a eunuch, overheard us;  very likely\nthe great number of sophists has made him annoyed with callers at the house:  at any rate, when we had knocked on the door, he opened it and, on seeing us,, he said, sophists there!  Master is engaged.  So saying, he seized the door with both hands and very smartly clapped it to with all his might.  We tried knocking again, and then he spoke in answer through the closed door,Sirs, have you not heard, he is engaged?  But, my good fellow, I said, we have not come to see Callias,\nnor are we sophists.  Have no fear:  I tell you, we have come to ask if we may see Protagoras;  so go and announce us.  Then with much hesitation the fellow opened the door to us and when we had entered, we came upon Protagoras as he was walking round in the cloister, and close behind him two companies were walking round also;  on the one side Callias, son of Hipponicus and his brother on the mother's side,\nParalus, son of Pericles, and Charmides, son of Glaucon, while the other troop consisted of Pericles' other son Xanthippus, Philippides, son of Philomelus, and Antimoerus of Mende, who is the most highly reputed of Protagoras' disciples and is taking the course professionally with a view to becoming a sophist.  The persons who followed in their rear, listening to what they could of the talk, seemed to be mostly strangers, brought by the great Protagoras from the several cities which he traverses, enchanting them with his voice like Orpheus, while they follow\n    where the voice sounds, enchanted;  and some of our own inhabitants were also dancing attendance.  As for me, when I saw their evolutions I was delighted with the admirable care they took not to hinder Protagoras at any moment by getting in front;  but whenever the master turned about and those with him, it was fine to see the orderly manner in which his train of listeners split up into two parties on this side and on that, and wheeling round formed up again each time in his rear most admirably. as Homer says, Hippias of ,\n    seated high on a chair in the doorway opposite;  and sitting around him on benches were Eryximachus, son of Acumenus, Phaedrus of Myrrhinous, Andron son of Androtion and a number of strangers,fellow-citizens of Hippias and some others.  They seemed to be asking him a series of astronomical questions on nature and the heavenly bodies, while he, seated in his chair, was distinguishing and expounding to each in turn the subjects of their questions.  for you know Prodicus of  is in  too:\nhe was in a certain apartment formerly used by Hipponieus as a strong-room, but now cleared out by Callias to make more space for his numerous visitors, and turned into a guest-chamber.  Well, Prodicus was still abed, wrapped up in sundry fleeces and rugs, and plenty of them too, it seemed;  and near him on the beds hard by lay Pausanias from Cerames, and with Pausanias a lad who was still quite young, of good birth and breeding, I should say,\nand at all events a very good-looking person.  I fancied I heard his name was Agathon, and I should not be surprised to find he is Pausanias' favorite.  Besides this youth there were the two Adeimantuses, sons of Cepis and Leucolophidas, and there seemed to be some others.  The subjects of their conversation I was unable to gather from outside, despite my longing to hear Prodicus;  for I regard the man as all-wise and divine:\nbut owing to the depth of his voice the room was filled with a booming sound which made the talk indistinct.We had only just come in, when close on our heels entered Alcibiades the good-looking, as you call him and I agree that he is, and Critias, son of Callaeschrus.  So, when we had entered, after some more little delays over certain points we had to examine, we went up to Protagoras,\nand I said:  Protagoras, you see we have come to you, Hippocrates and I.Is it your wish, he asked, to converse with me alone, or in company with others?It is all the same to us, I replied:  let me first tell you our object in coming, and then you must decide.Well, what is your object? he asked.My friend Hippocrates is a native of the city, a son of Apollodorus and one of a great and prosperous family, while his own natural powers seem to make him a match for anyone of his age.\nI fancy he is anxious to gain consideration in our city, and he believes he can best gain it by consorting with you.  So now it is for you to judge whether it will be fittest for you to converse on this matter privately with us alone, or in company with others.You do right, Socrates, he said, to he so thoughtful on my behalf.  For when one goes as a stranger into great cities, and there tries to persuade the best of the young men to drop their other connexions, either with their own folk or with foreigners, both old and young, and to join one's own circle, with the promise of improving them by this connexion with oneself,\nsuch a proceeding requires great caution;  since very considerable jealousies are apt to ensue, and numerous enmities and intrigues.  Now I tell you that sophistry is an ancient art, and those men of ancient times who practised it, fearing the odium it involved, disguised it in a decent dress, sometimes of poetry, as in the case of Homer, Hesiod, and Simonides sometimes of mystic rites and soothsayings, as did Orpheus, Musaeus and their sects;  and sometimes too, I have observed, of athletics, as with Iccus of  and another still livingas great a sophist as any\nHerodicus of , originally of ;  and music was the disguise employed by your own Agathocles, a great sophist, Pythocleides of , and many more.  All these, as I say, from fear of ill-will made use of these arts\nas outer coverings.  But I do not conform to the method of all these persons, since I believe they did not accomplish any of their designs:  for the purpose of all this disguise could not escape the able men of affairs in each city;  the multitude, of course, perceive practically nothing, but merely echo this or that pronouncement of their leaders.  Now to try to run away, and to fail through being caught in the act,\nshows sad folly in the mere attempt, and must needs make people far more hostile;  for they regard such an one, whatever else he may be, as a rogue.  Hence the road I have taken is one entirely opposite to theirs:  I admit that I am a sophist and that I educate men;  and I consider this precaution, of admitting rather than denying, the better of the two.  There are others besides that I have meditated, so as to avoid, under Heaven,\nany harm that may come of admitting that I am a sophist.  And yet many long years have I now been in the profession, for many in total number are those that I have lived:  not one of you all, but in age I might be his father.  Hence it suits me by far the best, in meeting your wishes, to make my discourse on these matters in the presence of all who are in the house.On this, as I suspected that he wished to make a display before Prodicus and Hippias, and give himself airs on the personal attachment shown by our coming to him, I remarked:\nThen surely we must call Prodicus and Hippias and their followers to come and listen to usBy all means, said Protagoras.Then do you agree, said Callias, to our making a session of it, so that we may sit at ease for our conversation?The proposal was accepted;  and all of us, delighted at the prospect of listening to wise men, took hold of the benches and couches ourselves and arranged them where Hippias was, since the benches were there already.  Meanwhile Callias and Alcibiades came,\nbringing with them Prodicus, whom they had induced to rise from his couch, and Prodicus' circle also.When we had all taken our seats,So now, Socrates, said Protagoras, since these gentlemen are also present, be so good as to tell what you were mentioning to me a little while before on the young man's behalf.To which I replied:\nThe same point, Protagoras, will serve me for a beginning as a moment ago, in regard to the object of my visit.  My friend Hippocrates finds himself desirous of joining your classes;  and therefore he says he would be glad to know what result he will get from joining them.  That is all the speech we have to make.Then Protagoras answered at once, saying:  Young man, you will gain this by coming to my classes, that on the day when you join them you will go home a better man, and on the day after it will be the same;  every day\nyou will constantly improve more and more.When I heard this I said: Protagoras, what you say is not at all surprising, but quite likely, since even you, though so old and so wise, would be made better if someone taught you what you happen not to know.  But let me put it another way:  suppose Hippocrates here should change his desire all at once, and become desirous of this young fellow's lessons who has just recently come to town, Zeuxippus of , and should approach him, as he now does you,\nand should hear the very same thing from him as from you,how on each day that he spent with him he would be better and make constant progress;  and suppose he were to question him on this and ask:  In what shall I become better as you say, and to what will my progress be?  Zeuxippus's reply would be, to painting.  Then suppose he came to the lessons of Orthagoras the Theban, and heard the same thing from him as from you, and then inquired of him for what he would be better each day through attending his classes, the answer would be, for fluting.  In the same way you also must satisfy this youth and me\non this point, and tell us for what, Protagoras, and in what connexion my friend Hippocrates, on any day of attendance at the classes of Protagoras, will go away a better man, and on each of the succeeding days will make a like advance.When Protagoras heard my words,You do right, he said, to ask that, while I am only too glad to answer those who ask the right question.  For Hippocrates, if he comes to me, will not be treated as he would have been if he had joined the classes of an ordinary sophist.  The generality of them maltreat the young;  for when they have escaped from the arts\nthey bring them back against their will and force them into arts, teaching them arithmetic and astronomy and geometry and music (and here he glanced at Hippias);  whereas, if he applies to me, he will learn precisely and solely that for which he has come.  That learning consists of good judgement in his own affairs, showing how best to order his own home;  and in the affairs of his city,\nshowing how he may have most influence on public affairs both in speech and in action.I wonder, I said, whether I follow what you are saying;  for you appear to be speaking of the civic science, and undertaking to make men good citizens.That, Socrates, he replied, is exactly the purport of what I profess.Then it is a goodly accomplishment that you have acquired, to be sure, I remarked, if indeed you have acquired itto such a man as you I may say sincerely what I think.  For this is a thing, Protagoras,\nthat I did not suppose to be teachable;  but when you say it is, I do not see how I am to disbelieve it.  How I came to think that it cannot be taught, or provided by men for men, I may be allowed to explain.  I say, in common with the rest of the Greeks, that the Athenians are wise.  Now I observe, when we are collected for the Assembly, and the city has to deal with an affair of building, we send for builders to advise us on what is proposed to be built;  and when it is a case of laying down a ship, we send for shipwrights;  and so in all other matters\nwhich are considered learnable and teachable:  but if anyone else, whom the people do not regard as a craftsman, attempts to advise them, no matter how handsome and wealthy and well-born he may be, not one of these things induces them to accept him;  they merely laugh him to scorn and shout him down, until either the speaker retires from his attempt, overborne by the clamor, or the tipstaves pull him from his place or turn him out altogether by order of the chair.  Such is their procedure in matters which they consider professional.  But when they have to deliberate on something connected with the administration of the State,\nthe man who rises to advise them on this may equally well be a smith, a shoemaker, a merchant, a sea-captain, a rich man, a poor man, of good family or of none, and nobody thinks of casting in his teeth, as one would in the former case, that his attempt to give advice is justified by no instruction obtained in any quarter, no guidance of any master;  and obviously it is because they hold that here the thing cannot be taught.  Nay further, it is not only so with the service of the State,\nbut in private life our best and wisest citizens are unable to transmit this excellence of theirs to others;  for Pericles, the father of these young fellows here, gave them a first-rate training in the subjects for which he found teachers, but in those of which he is himself a master\nhe neither trains them personally nor commits them to another's guidance, and so they go about grazing at will like sacred oxen, on the chance of their picking up excellence here or there for themselves.  Or, if you like, there is Cleinias, the younger brother of Alcibiades here, whom this same Pericles, acting as his guardian, and fearing lie might be corrupted, I suppose, by Alcibiades, carried off from his brother and placed in Ariphron's family to be educated:  but before six months had passed he handed him back to Alcibiades,\nat a loss what to do with him.  And there are a great many others whom I could mention to you as having never succeeded, though virtuous themselves, in making anyone else better, either of their own or of other families.  I therefore, Protagoras, in view of these facts, believe that virtue is not teachable:  but when I hear you speak thus, I am swayed over, and suppose there is something in what you say, because I consider you to have gained experience in many things and to have learnt many, besides finding out some for yourself.  So if you can demonstrate to us more explicitly that virtue is teachable,\ndo not grudge us your demonstration.No, Socrates, I will not grudge it you;  but shall I, as an old man speaking to his juniors, put my demonstration in the form of a fable, or of a regular exposition?Many of the company sitting by him instantly bade him treat his subject whichever way he pleased.Well then, he said, I fancy the more agreeable way is for me to tell you a fable.There was once a time when there were gods, but no mortal creatures.\nAnd when to these also came their destined time to be created, the gods moulded their forms within the earth, of a mixture made of earth and fire and all substances that are compounded with fire and earth.  When they were about to bring these creatures to light, they charged Prometheus and Epimetheus to deal to each the equipment of his proper faculty.  Epimetheus besought Prometheus that he might do the dealing himself;  And when I have dealt, he said, you shall examine.\nHaving thus persuaded him he dealt;  and in dealing he attached strength without speed;  to some, while the weaker he equipped with speed; and some he armed, while devising for others, along with an unarmed condition, some different faculty for preservation.  To those which he invested with smallness he dealt a winged escape or an underground habitation;  those which he increased in largeness he preserved\nby this very means;  and he dealt all the other properties on this plan of compensation.  In contriving all this he was taking precaution that no kind should be extinguished;  and when he had equipped them with avoidances of mutual destruction, he devised a provision against the seasons ordained by Heaven, in clothing them about with thick-set hair and solid hides, sufficient to ward off winter yet able to shield them also from the heats, and so that on going to their lairs they might find in these same things a bedding of their own that was native to each;  and some he shod with hoofs,\nothers with claws and solid, bloodless hides.  Then he proceeded to furnish each of them with its proper food, some with pasture of the earth, others with fruits of trees, and others again with roots;  and to a certain number for food he gave other creatures to devour:  to some he attached a paucity in breeding, and to others, which were being consumed by these, a plenteous brood, and so procured survival of their kind.  Now Epimetheus, being not so wise as he might be,\nheedlessly squandered his stock of properties on the brutes;  he still had left unequipped the race of men, and was at a loss what to do with it.  As he was casting about, Prometheus arrived to examine his distribution, and saw that whereas the other creatures were fully and suitably provided, man was naked, unshod, unbedded, unarmed;  and already the destined day was come, whereon man like the rest should emerge from earth to light.  Then Prometheus, in his perplexity as to what preservation he could devise for man, stole from Hephaestus and Athena wisdom in the arts\nogether with firesince by no means without fire could it be acquired or helpfully used by anyand he handed it there and then as a gift to man.  Now although man acquired in this way the wisdom of daily life, civic wisdom he had not, since this was in the possession of Zeus;  Prometheus could not make so free as to enter the citadel which is the dwelling-place of Zeus, and moreover the guards of Zeus were terrible:  but he entered unobserved the building shared by Athena and Hephaestus\nfor the pursuit of their arts, and stealing Hephaestus's fiery art and all Athena's also he gave them to man, and hence it is\nthat man gets facility for his livelihood, but Prometheus, through Epimetheus' fault, later on (the story goes) stood his trial for theft.And now that man was partaker of a divine portion, he, in the first place, by his nearness of kin to deity, was the only creature that worshipped gods, and set himself to establish altars and holy images;  and secondly, he soon was enabled by his skill to articulate speech and words, and to invent dwellings, clothes, sandals, beds, and the foods that are of the earth.  Thus far provided, men dwelt separately in the beginning, and cities there were none;\nso that they were being destroyed by the wild beasts, since these were in all ways stronger than they;  and although their skill in handiwork was a sufficient aid in respect of food, in their warfare with the beasts it was defective;  for as yet they had no civic art, which includes the art of war.  So they sought to band themselves together and secure their lives by founding cities.  Now as often as they were banded together they did wrong to one another through the lack of civic art,\nand thus they began to be scattered again and to perish.  So Zeus, fearing that our race was in danger of utter destruction, sent Hermes to bring respect and right among men, to the end that there should be regulation of cities and friendly ties to draw them together.  Then Hermes asked Zeus in what manner then was he to give men right and respect:  Am I to deal them out as the arts have been dealt?  That dealing was done in such wise that one man possessing medical art is able to treat many ordinary men, and so with the other craftsmen.  Am I to place among men right and respect in this way also, or deal them out to all?\nTo all, replied Zeus;  let all have their share:  for cities cannot be formed if only a few have a share of these as of other arts.  And make thereto a law of my ordaining, that he who cannot partake of respect and right shall die the death as a public pest.  Hence it comes about, Socrates, that people in cities, and especially in , consider it the concern of a few to advise on cases of artistic excellence or good craftsmanship,\nand if anyone outside the few gives advice they disallow it, as you say, and not without reason, as I think:  but when they meet for a consultation on civic art,\nwhere they should be guided throughout by justice and good sense, they naturally allow advice from everybody, since it is held that everyone should partake of this excellence, or else that states cannot be.  This, Socrates, is the explanation of it.  And that you may not think you are mistaken, to show how all men verily believe that everyone partakes of justice and the rest of civic virtue, I can offer yet a further proof.  In all other excellences, as you say, when a man professes to be good at flute-playing or any other art in which he has no such skill, they either laugh him to scorn or are annoyed with him, and his people come and reprove him for being so mad:\n but where justice or any other civic virtue is involved, and they happen to know that a certain person is unjust, if he confesses the truth about his conduct before the public, that truthfulness which in the former arts they would regard as good sense they here call madness.  Everyone, they say, should profess to be just, whether he is so or not, and whoever does not make some pretension to justice is mad;  since it is held that all without exception\nmust needs partake of it in some way or other, or else not be of human kind.Take my word for it, then, that they have good reason for admitting everybody as adviser on this virtue, owing to their belief that everyone has some of it;  and next, that they do not regard it as natural or spontaneous, but as something taught and acquired after careful preparation by those who acquire it,of this I will now endeavor to convince you.\nIn all cases of evils which men deem to have befallen their neighbors by nature or fortune, nobody is wroth with them or reproves or lectures or punishes them, when so afflicted, with a view to their being other than they are;  one merely pities them.  Who, for instance, is such a fool as to try to do anything of the sort to the ugly, the puny, or the weak?  Because, I presume, men know that it is by nature and fortune that people get these things, the graces of life and their opposites.  But as to all the good things that people are supposed to get by application and practice and teaching,\nwhere these are lacking in anyone and only their opposite evils are found, here surely are the occasions for wrath and punishment and reproof.  One of them is injustice, and impiety, and in short all that is opposed\nto civic virtue;  in such case anyone will be wroth with his neighbor and reprove him, clearly because the virtue is to be acquired by application and learning.  For if you will consider punishment, Socrates, and what control it has over wrong-doers, the facts will inform you that men agree in regarding virtue as procured.  No one punishes a wrong-doer from the mere contemplation\nor on account of his wrong-doing, unless one takes unreasoning vengeance like a wild beast.  But he who undertakes to punish with reason does not avenge himself for the past offence, since he cannot make what was done as though it had not come to pass;  he looks rather to the future, and aims at preventing that particular person and others who see him punished from doing wrong again.  And being so minded he must have in mind that virtue comes by training:  for you observe that he punishes to deter.  This then is the accepted view\nof all who seek requital in either private or public life;  and while men in general exact requital and punishment from those whom they suppose to have wronged them, this is especially the case with the Athenians, your fellow-citizens, so that by our argument the Athenians also share the view that virtue is procured and taught.  Thus I have shown that your fellow-citizens have good reason for admitting a smith's or cobbler's counsel in public affairs, and that they hold virtue to be taught and procured:\nof this I have given you satisfactory demonstration, Socrates, as it appears to me.I have yet to deal with your remaining problem about good men, why it is that these good men have their sons taught the subjects in the regular teachers' courses, and so far make them wise, but do not make them excel in that virtue wherein consists their own goodness.  On this point, Socrates, I shall give you argument instead of fable.  Now consider:  is there,\nor is there not, some one thing whereof all the citizens must needs partake, if there is to be a city?  Here, and nowhere if not here, is the solution of this problem of yours.  For if there is such a thing, and that one thing, instead of being the joiner's or smith's or potter's art, is rather justice and temperance and holiness\nin short, what I may put together and call a man's virtue;  and if it is this whereof all should partake and wherewith everyone should proceed to any further knowledge or action, but should not if he lacks it;  if we should instruct and punish such as do not partake of it, whether child or husband or wife, until the punishment of such persons has made them better,\nand should cast forth from our cities or put to death as incurable whoever fails to respond to such punishment and instruction;if it is like this, and yet, its nature being so, good men have their sons instructed in everything else but this, what very surprising folk the good are found to be!  For we have proved that they regard this thing as teachable both in private and in public life, and then, though it may be taught and fostered, are we to say that they have their sons taught everything in which the penalty for ignorance is not death, but in a matter where the death-penalty or exile awaits their children\nif not instructed and cultivated in virtueand not merely death, but confiscation of property and practically the entire subversion of their househere they do not have them taught or take the utmost care of them?  So at any rate we must conclude, Socrates.They teach and admonish them from earliest childhood till the last day of their lives.  As soon as one of them grasps what is said to him, the nurse, the mother, the tutor, and the father himself strive hard\nthat the child may excel, and as each act and word occurs they teach and impress upon him that this is just, and that unjust, one thing noble, another base, one holy, another unholy, and that he is to do this, and not do that.  If he readily obeys,so;  but if not, they treat him as a bent and twisted piece of wood and straighten him with threats and blows.  After this they send them to school and charge the master to take far more pains over their children's good behavior than over their letters\nand harp-playing.  The masters take pains accordingly, and the children, when they have learnt their letters and are getting to understand the written word as before they did only the spoken, are furnished with works of good poets to read as they sit in class, and are made to learn them off by heart:\nhere they meet with many admonitions, many descriptions and praises and eulogies of good men in times past, that the boy in envy may imitate them and yearn to become even as they.  Then also the music-masters, in a similar sort, take pains for their self-restraint, and see that their young charges do not go wrong:  moreover, when they learn to play the harp, they are taught the works of another set of good poets,\nthe song-makers, while the master accompanies them on the harp;  and they insist on familiarizing the boys' souls with the rhythms and scales, that they may gain in gentleness, and by advancing in rhythmic and harmonic grace may be efficient in speech and action;  for the whole of man's life requires the graces of rhythm and harmony.  Again, over and above all this, people send their sons to a trainer, that having improved their bodies they may perform the orders of their minds,\nwhich are now in fit condition, and that they may not be forced by bodily faults to play the coward in wars and other duties.  This is what people do, who are most able;  and the most able are the wealthiest.  Their sons begin school at the earliest age, and are freed from it at the latest.  And when they are released from their schooling the city next compels them to learn the laws and to live according to them as after a pattern,\nthat their conduct may not be swayed by their own light fancies, but just as writing-masters first draw letters in faint outline with the pen for their less advanced pupils, and then give them the copy-book and make them write according to the guidance of their lines, so the city sketches out for them the laws devised by good lawgivers of yore, and constrains them to govern and be governed according to these.  She punishes anyone who steps outside these borders, and this punishment among you and in many other cities,\nfrom the corrective purpose of the prosecution, is called a Correction.  Seeing then that so much care is taken in the matter of both private and public virtue, do you wonder, Socrates, and make it a great difficulty, that virtue may be taught?  Surely there is no reason to wonder at that:  you would have far greater reason, if it were not so.Then why is it that many sons of good fathers turn out so meanly?  Let me explain this also:  it is no wonder, granted that I was right in stating just now that no one,\nif we are to have a city, must be a mere layman in this affair of virtue.  For if what I say is the caseand it is supremely truereflect on the nature of any other pursuit or study that you choose to mention.  Suppose that there could be no state unless we were all flute-players, in such sort as each was able, and suppose that everyone were giving his neighbor both private and public lessons in the art, and rebuked him too, if he failed to do it well, without grudging him the troubleeven as no one now thinks of grudging\nor reserving his skill in what is just and lawful as he does in other expert knowledge;  for our neighbors' justice and virtue, I take it, is to our advantage, and consequently we all tell and teach one another what is just and lawfulwell, if we made the same zealous and ungrudging efforts to instruct each other in flute-playing, do you think, Socrates, that the good flute-players would be more likely than the bad to have sons who were good flute-players?  I do not think they would:\nno, wherever the son had happened to be born with a nature most apt for flute-playing, he would be found to have advanced to distinction, and where unapt, to obscurity.  Often the son of a good player would turn out a bad one, and often of a bad, a good.  But, at any rate, all would be capable players as compared with ordinary persons who had no inkling of the art.  Likewise in the present case you must regard any man who appears to you the most unjust person ever reared among human laws and society as a just man and\na craftsman of justice, if he had to stand comparison with people who lacked education and law courts and laws and any constant compulsion to the pursuit of virtue, but were a kind of wild folk such as Pherecrates the poet brought on the scene at last year's Lenaeum. Sure enough, if you found yourself among such people, as did the misanthropes among his chorus, you would be very glad to meet with Eurybatus and Phrynondas,\nand would bewail yourself with longing for the wickedness of the people here.  Instead of that you give yourself dainty airs, Socrates, because everyone is a teacher of virtue to the extent of his powers, and you think there is no teacher.  Why, you might as well ask who is a teacher of Greek;\nyou would find none anywhere;  and I suppose you might ask, who can teach the sons of our artisans the very crafts which of course they have learnt from their fathers, as far as the father was competent in each case, and his friends who followed the same trade,I say if you asked who is to give these further instruction, I imagine it would be hard, Socrates, to find them a teacher, but easy enough in the case of those starting with no skill at all.  And so it must be with virtue and everything else;  if there is somebody who excels us ever so little\nin showing the way to virtue, we must be thankful.  Such an one I take myself to be, excelling all other men in the gift of assisting people to become good and true, and giving full value for the fee that I chargenay, so much more than full, that the learner himself admits it.  For this reason I have arranged my charges on a particular plan:  when anyone has had lessons from me, if he likes he pays the sum that I ask;  if not,\nhe goes to a temple, states on oath the value he sets on what he has learnt, and disburses that amount.  So now, Socrates, I have shown you by both fable and argument that virtue is teachable and is so deemed by the Athenians, and that it is no wonder that bad sons are born of good fathers and good of bad, since even the sons of Polycleitus, companions of Paralus and Xanthippus here, are not to be compared with their father, and the same is the case in other craftsmen's families.  As for these two, it is not fair to make this complaint of them yet;\nthere is still hope in their case, for they are young.After this great and fine performance Protagoras ceased from speaking.  As for me, for a good while I was still under his spell and kept on looking at him as though he were going to say more, such was my eagerness to hear:  but when I perceived that he had really come to a stop, I pulled myself together, as it were, with an effort, and looking at Hippocrates I said:  Son of Apollodorus, I am very grateful to you for inducing me to come hither;\nfor it is a great treat to have heard what I have heard from Protagoras.  I used formerly to think that there was no human treatment by which the good were made good, but now I am convinced that there is.  Only I find one slight difficulty, which Protagoras will of course easily explain away, since he has explained so many puzzles already.  If one should be present when any of the public speakers were dealing with\nthese same subjects, one could probably hear similar discourses from Pericles or some other able speaker:  but suppose you put a question to one of themthey are just like books, incapable of either answering you or putting a question of their own;  if you question even a small point in what has been said, just as brazen vessels ring a long time after they have been struck and prolong the note unless you put your hand on them, these orators too, on being asked a little question,\nextend their speech over a full-length course.  But Protagoras here, while able to deliver, as events have shown, a long and excellent speech, is also able when questioned to reply briefly, and after asking a question to await and accept the answeraccomplishments that few can claim.  And now, Protagoras, there is one little thing wanting to the completeness of what I have got, so please answer me this.  You say that virtue may be taught, and if there is anybody in the world who could convince me, you are the man:  but there was a point in your speech\nat which I wondered, and on which my spirit would fain be satisfied.  You said that Zeus had sent justice and respect to mankind, and furthermore it was frequently stated in your discourse that justice, temperance, holiness and the rest were all but one single thing, virtue:  pray, now proceed to deal with these in more precise exposition, stating whether virtue is a single thing, of which justice and temperance and holiness are parts,\nor whether the qualities I have just mentioned are all names of the same single thing.  This is what I am still hankering after.Why, the answer to that is easy, Socrates, he replied:  it is that virtue is a single thing and the qualities in question are parts of it.Do you mean parts, I asked, in the sense of the parts of a face, as mouth, nose, eyes, and ears;  or, as in the parts of gold, is there no difference among the pieces, either between the parts or between a part and the whole, except in greatness and smallness?In the former sense, I think, Socrates;  as the parts of the face\nare to the whole face.Well then, I continued, when men partake of these portions of virtue, do some have one, and some another, or if you get one, must you have them all?By no means, he replied, since many are brave but unjust, and many again are just but not wise.Then are these also parts of virtue,\nI askedwisdom and courage?Most certainly, I should say, he replied and of the parts, wisdom is the greatest.Each of them, I proceeded, is distinct from any other?Yes.Does each also have its particular function?  Just as, in the parts of the face, the eye is not like the ears, nor is its function the same;  nor is any of the other parts like another, in its function or in any other respect:  in the same way, are the parts of virtue unlike each other,\nboth in themselves and in their functions?  Are they not evidently so, if the analogy holds?Yes, they are so, Socrates, he said.So then, I went on, among the parts of virtue, no other part is like knowledge, or like justice, or like courage, or like temperance, or like holiness.He agreed.Come now, I said, let us consider together what sort of thing is each of these parts.  First let us ask,\nis justice something, or not a thing at all?  I think it is; what do you say?So do I, he replied.Well then, suppose someone should ask you and me:  Protagoras and Socrates, pray tell me thisthe thing you named just now, justice, is that itself just or unjust?  I should reply, it is just:  what would your verdict be?  The same as mine or different?The same, he said.Then justice,\nI should say in reply to our questioner, is of a kind that is just:  would you also?Yes, he said.Now suppose he proceeded to ask us:  Do you also speak of a holiness?  We should say we do, I fancy.Yes, he said.Then do you call this a thing also?  We should say we do, should we not?He assented again.Do you say this thing itself is of such nature as to be unholy, or holy?  For my part I should be annoyed at this question, I said, and should answer:  Hush, my good sir!\nIt is hard to see how anything could be holy, if holiness itself is not to be holy!  And youwould you not make the same reply?Certainly I would, he said.Now suppose he went on to ask us:  Well, and what of your statement a little while since?  Perhaps I did not hear you aright, but I understood you two to say that the parts of virtue are in such a relation to each other that one of them is not like another.  Here my answer would be:  As to the substance of it, you heard aright, but you made a mistake in thinking that I had any share in that statement.\nIt was Protagoras here who made that answer;  I was only the questioner.  Then suppose he were to ask:  Is our friend telling the truth, Protagoras?  Is it you who say that one part of virtue is not like another?  Is this statement yours?  What answer would you give him?I must needs admit it, Socrates, he said.Well now, Protagoras, after that admission, what answer shall we give him, if he goes on to ask this question:  Is not holiness something of such nature as to be just, and justice such as to be holy, or can it be unholy?  Can holiness be not just, and therefore unjust, and justice unholy?\nWhat is to be our reply?  I should say myself, on my own behalf, that both justice is holy and holiness just, and with your permission I would make this same reply for you also;  since justness is either the same thing as holiness or extremely like it, and above all, justice is of the same kind as holiness, and holiness as justice.  Are you minded to forbid this answer, or are you in agreement with it?I do not take quite so simple a view of it, Socrates,\nas to grant that justice is holy and holiness just.  I think we have to make a distinction here.  Yet what difference does it make?  he said:  if you like, let us assume that justice is holy and holiness just.No, no, I said;  I do not want this if you like or if you agree sort of thing to be put to the proof, but you and me together;  and when I say you and me I mean that our statement will be most properly tested\nif we take away the if.Well, at any rate, he said, justice has some resemblance to holiness;  for anything in the world has some sort of resemblance to any other thing.  Thus there is a point in which white resembles black, and hard soft, and so with all the other things which are regarded as most opposed to each other;  and the things which we spoke of before as having different faculties and not being of the same kind as each otherthe parts of the facethese in some sense resemble one another and are of like sort.  In this way therefore you could prove, if you chose,\nthat even these things are all like one another.  But it is not fair to describe things as like which have some point alike, however small, or ash unlike that have some point unlike.This surprised me, and I said to him:  What, do you regard just and holy as so related to each other that they have only some small point of likeness?Not so, he replied, at all, nor yet,\non the other hand, as I believe you regard them.Well then, I said, since I find you chafe at this suggestion, we will let it pass, and consider another instance that you gave.  Is there a thing you call folly?Yes, he said.Is not the direct opposite to that thing wisdom?I think so, he said.And when men behave rightly and usefully, do you consider them temperate in so behaving, or the opposite?Temperate, he said.\nThen is it by temperance that they are temperate?Necessarily.Now those who do not behave rightly behave foolishly, and are not temperate in so behaving?I agree, he said.And behaving foolishly is the opposite to behaving temperately?Yes, he said.Now foolish behavior is due to folly, and temperate behavior to temperance?He assented.And whatever is done by strength is done strongly, and whatever by weakness, weakly?He agreed.And whatever with swiftness, swiftly, and whatever with slowness, slowly ?\nYes, he said.And so whatever is done in a certain way is done by that kind of faculty, and whatever in an opposite way, by the opposite kind?He agreed.Pray now, I proceeded, is there such a thing as the beautiful?He granted it.Has this any opposite except the ugly?None.Well, is there such a thing as the good?There is.Has it any opposite but the evil?None.Tell me, is there such a thing as shrill in the voice?Yes, he said.Has it any other opposite than deep.No, he said.Now, I went on, each single opposite has but one opposite,\nnot many?He admitted this.Come now, I said, let us reckon up our points of agreement.  We have agreed that one thing has but one opposite, and no more?We have.And that what is done in an opposite way is done by opposites?Yes, he said.And we have agreed that what is done foolishly is done in an opposite way to what is done temperately?Yes, he said.And that what is done temperately is done by temperance, and what foolishly by folly?\nHe assented.Now if it is done in an opposite way, it must be done by an opposite?Yes?And one is done by temperance, and the other by folly?Yes.In an opposite way?Certainly.And by opposite faculties?Yes.Then folly is opposite to temperanceApparently.Now do you recollect that in the previous stage we have agreed that folly is opposite to wisdom?He admitted this.And that one thing has but one opposite?Yes.\nThen which, Protagoras, of our propositions are we to rejectthe statement that one thing has but one opposite;  or the other, that wisdom is different from temperance, and each is a part of virtue, and moreover, a different part, and that the two are as unlike, both in themselves and in their faculties, as the parts of the face?  Which are we to upset?  The two of them together are not quite in tune;  they do not chime in harmony.  How could they,\nif one thing must needs have but one opposite and no more, while wisdom, and temperance likewise, appear both to be opposite to folly, which is a single thing?  Such is the position, Protagoras, I said or is it otherwise?He admitted it was so, much against his will.Then temperance and wisdom must be one thing?  And indeed we found before that justice and holiness were almost the same thing.  Come, Protagoras, I said, let us not falter, but carry out our inquiry to the end.  Tell me, does a man who acts unjustly seem to you to be temperate\nin so acting?I should be ashamed, Socrates, he replied, to admit that, in spite of what many people say.Then shall I address my argument to them, I asked, or to you?If you please, he answered, debate first against that popular theory.It is all the same to me, I said, so long as you make answer, whether it be your own opinion or not.  For although my first object is to test the argument, the result perhaps will be that both I, the questioner, and my respondent are brought to the test.\nAt first Protagoras appeared to be coy, alleging that the argument was too disconcerting:  however he consented at length to make answer.  Well now, I said, begin at the beginning, and tell me, do you consider people to be temperate when they are unjust?Let us suppose so, he said.And by being temperate you mean being sensible?Yes.And being sensible is being well-advised in their injustice?Let us grant it, he said.Does this mean, I asked, if they fare well by their injustice, or if they fare ill?If they fare well.Now do you say there are things that are good?I do.Then, I asked, are those things good which are profitable to men?\nOh yes, to be sure, he replied, and also when they are not profitable to men I call them good.Here Protagoras seemed to me to be in a thoroughly provoked and harassed state, and to have set his face against answering:  so when I saw him in this mood I grew wary and went gently with my questions.  Do you mean, Protagoras, I asked,\nthings that are profitable to no human being, or things not profitable in any way at all?  Can you call such things as these good?By no means, he replied;  but I know a number of things that are unprofitable to men, namely, foods, drinks, drugs, and countless others, and some that are profitable;  some that are neither one nor the other to men, but are one or the other to horses;  and some that are profitable only to cattle, or again to dogs;  some also that are not profitable to any of those, but are to trees;  and some that are good for the roots of a tree, but bad for its shootssuch as dung,\nwhich is a good thing when applied to the roots of all plants, whereas if you chose to cast it on the young twigs and branches, it will ruin all.  And oil too is utterly bad for all plants, and most deadly for the hair of all animals save that of man, while to the hair of man it is helpful, as also to the rest of his body.  The good is such an elusive and diverse thing that in this instance it is good for the outward parts of man's body,\nbut at the same time as bad as can be for the inward;  and for this reason all doctors forbid the sick to take oil, except the smallest possible quantity, in what one is going to eatjust enough to quench the loathing that arises in the sensations of one's nostrils from food and its dressings.When he had thus spoken, the company acclaimed it as an excellent answer;  and then I remarked:  Protagoras, I find I am a forgetful sort of person,\nand if someone addresses me at any length I forget the subject on which he is talking.  So, just as you, in entering on a discussion with me, would think fit to speak louder to me than to others if I happened to be hard of hearing, please bear in mind now that you have to deal with a forgetful person, and therefore cut up your answers into shorter pieces, that I may be able to follow you.Well, what do you mean by short answers?  he asked:  do you want me to make them shorter than they should be?Not at all, I said.   As long as they should be?  he asked.   Yes, I said.\nThen are my answers to be as long as I think they should be, or as you think they should be?Well, for instance, I have heard, I said, that you yourself are able, in treating one and the same subject, not only to instruct another person in it but to speak on it at length, if you choose, without ever being at a loss for matter;  or again briefly,\nso as to yield to no one in brevity of expression. So, if you are going to argue with me, employ with me the latter method, that of brevity.Socrates, he said, I have undertaken in my time many contests of speech, and if I were to do what you demand, and argue just in the way that my opponent demanded, I should not be held superior to anyone nor would Protagoras have made a name among the Greeks.Then, as I saw that he had not been quite satisfied with himself in making his former answers, and that he would not readily\naccept the part of answerer in debate, I considered it was not my business to attend his meetings further, and remarked:  But you know, Protagoras, I too feel uncomfortable about our having this discussion against your inclination;  but when you agree to argue in such a way that I can follow, then I will argue with you. For youas people relate of you, and you yourself assertare able to hold a discussion in the form of either long or short speeches;  you are a man of knowledge:\nbut I have no ability for these long speeches, though I could wish that I had it.  Surely you, who are proficient in both ways, ought to have made us this concession, that so we might have had our debate.  But now that you refuse, and I am somewhat pressed for time and could not stay to hear you expatiate at any lengthfor I have an appointmentI will be off;  though I daresay I should be happy enough to hear your views.With these words I rose as if to go away;  but, as I was getting up,\nCallias laid hold of my arm with his right hand, and grasped this cloak of mine with his left, and said:  We will not let you go, Socrates;  for if you leave us our discussions will not go so well. I beg you therefore to stay with us, for there is nothing I would rather hear than an argument between you and Protagoras.  Come, you must oblige us all.  Then I said (I was now standing up as though to go out):  Son of Hipponicus, I always admire your love of knowledge, but especially do I commend and love it now,\nso that I should be very glad to oblige you if you asked of me something that I could do:  but I am afraid it is as though you asked me to keep pace with Criso the runner of Himera in his prime, or to keep up in a match with one of the long-distance or day-course racers, and I could only tell you that\nI wish that of myself, without your asking, I could keep pace with such runners, but of course I cannot.  If you want to have the spectacle of Criso and me running together, you must ask him to adapt his pace;  for whereas I cannot run fast, he can run slowly.  So if you desire to hear Protagoras and me, ask him to resume the method of answering which he used at firstin short sentences and keeping to the point raised.  Otherwise\nwhat is to be our mode of discussion?  For I thought that to hold a joint discussion and to make a harangue were two distinct things.Ah, but you see, Socrates, he said, Protagoras thinks it only fair to claim that he be allowed to discuss in his chosen style, in return for your claim that it should be in yours.At this Alcibiades intervened, saying:  You do not state it quite philosophically, Callias, for Socrates here confesses he is no hand at long discourses, and yields therein to Protagoras;\nbut I should be surprised if he yields to any man in ability to argue, or in understanding the interchange of reason.  Now if Protagoras confesses himself inferior to Socrates in argumentation, Socrates has no more to ask:  but if he challenges him, let him discuss by question and answer;  not spinning out a lecture on each questionbeating off the arguments, refusing to give a reason, and so dilating\nuntil most of his hearers have forgotten the point at issue.  For Socrates, I warrant you, will not forget, despite his jesting way of calling himself forgetful.  Now I think Socrates' proposal is the more equitablefor each of us should declare his personal opinion.After Alcibiades, the next, I believe, to speak was Critias:  Prodicus and Hippias, he said, it seems to me that Callias is all for supporting Protagoras, while Alcibiades is always for a contest\nin anything he takes up.  It is not for us to contend on either side for Socrates or for Protagoras, but jointly to request them both not to break off\nour conference unconcluded.When he had said this, Prodicus remarked:  I think you are right, Critias:  those who attend this sort of discussion ought to be joint, but not equal, hearers of both disputants.  For there is a difference:  we should listen jointly to them both, yet not give equal heed to each, but more to the wiser and less to the less intelligent.  I on my part also, Protagoras and Socrates, call upon you to accede to our request, and to dispute,\nbut not wrangle, with each other over your arguments:  for friends dispute with friends, just from good feeling;  whereas wrangling is between those who are at variance and enmity with one another.  In this way our meeting will have highest success, since you the speakers will thus earn the greatest measure of good repute, not praise, from us who hear you.  For good repute is present in the hearers' souls without deception, but praise is too often in the words of liars who hide what they really think.\nAgain, we listeners would thus be most comforted, not pleased;  for he is comforted who learns something and gets a share of good sense in his mind alone, whereas he is pleased who eats something or has some other pleasant sensation only in his body.When Prodicus had thus spoken, quite a number of the company showed their approval then after Prodicus the learned Hippias spoke:  Gentlemen, he said, who are here present, I regard you all as kinsmen and intimates and fellow-citizens by nature, not by law:\nfor like is akin to like by nature, whereas law, despot of mankind, often constrains us against nature.  Hence it would be shameful if we, while knowing the nature of things, should yetbeing the wisest of the Greeks, and having met together for the very purpose in the very sanctuary of the wisdom of , and in this the greatest and most auspicious house of the city of citiesdisplay no worthy sign of this dignity,\nbut should quarrel with each other like low churls.  Now let me beg and advise you, Protagoras and Socrates, to come to terms arranged, as it were, under our arbitration:  you, Socrates, must, not require that precise form\nof discussion with its extreme brevity, if it is disagreeable to Protagoras, but let the speeches have their head with a loose rein, that they may give us a more splendid and elegant impression;  nor must you, Protagoras, let out full sail, as you run before the breeze, and so escape into the ocean of speech leaving the land nowhere in sight;  rather, both of you must take a middle course.  So you shall do as I say, and I strongly urge you to choose an umpire or supervisor or chairman\nwho will keep watch for you over the due measure of either's speeches.His proposal was approved by the company, and they all applauded it:  Callias said he would not let me go, and they requested me to choose a supervisor.  To this I replied that it would be a shame to choose an arbiter for our discussion;  for if he who is chosen, said I, is to be our inferior, it would not be right to have the inferior overseeing the superior;  while if he is our equal, that will be just as wrong, for our equal will only do very much as we do, and it will be superfluous to choose him.\nYou may say you will choose one who is our superior.  This, in very truth, I hold to be impossibleto choose someone who is wiser than our friend Protagoras;  and if you choose one who is not his superior, though you may say he is, that again would cast a slur on him, as if he were some paltry fellow requiring a supervisor;  for, as far as I am concerned, the matter is indifferent.  But let me tell you how I would have the thing done, so that your eagerness for a conference and a discussion may be satisfied. If Protagoras does not wish to answer,\nlet him ask questions, and I will answer:  at the same time I will try to show him how the answerer, in my view, ought to answer;  and when I have answered all the questions that he wishes to ask, in his turn he shall render account in like manner to me.  So if he does not seem very ready to answer the particular question put to him, you and I will join in beseeching him, as you have besought me, not to upset our conference.  And for this plan there is no need to have one man as supervisor;\nyou will all supervise it together.They all resolved that it should be done in this way:  Protagoras, though very unwilling, was obliged after all to agree to ask questions and then, when he had asked a sufficient number, to take his turn at making due response in short answers.And so he began to put questions in this sort of way:  I consider, Socrates, that the greatest part\nof a man's education is to be skilled in the matter of verses;  that is, to be able to apprehend, in the utterances of the poets, what has been rightly and what wrongly composed, and to know how to distinguish them and account for them when questioned.  Accordingly my question now will be on the same subject that you and I are now debating, namely virtue, but taken in connexion with poetry:  that will be the only difference.  Now, Simonides, I think, somewhere remarks to Scopas, the son of Creon of \nDo you know the ode, or shall I recite the whole?To this I replied:  There is no need, for I know it it happens that I have especially studied that ode.I am glad to hear it, he said.  Now do you regard it as finely and correctly composed or not?Very finely and correctly, I replied.And do you regard it as finely composed, if the poet contradicts himself?No, I replied.Then observe it more closely, he said.\nMy good sir, I have given it ample attention.Are you aware, then, he asked, that as the ode proceeds he says at one pointDo you note that this and the former are statements of the same person?I know that, I said.Then do you think the second agrees with the first?So far as I can see, it does, I replied (at the same time, though, I was afraid there was something in what he said).  Why, I asked, does it not seem so to you?\nHow can anyone, he replied, be thought consistent, who says both of these things?  First he laid it down himself that it is hard for a man to become good in truth, and then a little further on in his poem he forgot, and he proceeds to blame Pittacus for saying the same as he didthat it is hard to be good, and refuses to accept from him the same statement that he made himself.  Yet, as often as he blames the man for saying the same as himself he obviously blames himself too, so that in either the former or the latter place his statement is wrong.This speech of his won a clamorous approval\nfrom many of his hearers;  and at first I felt as though I had been struck by a skilful boxer, and was quite blind and dizzy with the effect of his words and the noise of their applause.  Thento tell you the honest truthin order to gain time for considering the poet's meaning, I turned to Prodicus and calling himProdicus, I said, surely Simonides was your townsman:  it behoves you to come to the man's rescue.  Accordingly I allow myself to call for your assistance\n    just as Scamander, in Homer, when besieged by Achilles, called Simois to his aid, sayingIn the same way I call upon you, lest Protagoras lay Simonides in ruins.  For indeed to rehabilitate Simonides requires your artistry,\nby which you can discriminate between wishing and desiring as two distinct things in the fine and ample manner of your statement just now.  So please consider if you agree with my view.  For it is not clear that Simonides does contradict himself.  Now you, Prodicus, shall declare your verdict first:  do you consider becoming and being to be the same or different?Different, to be sure, said Prodicus.Now in the first passage, I said, Simonides gave it as his own opinion that it is hard for a man\nto become good in truth.Quite true, said Prodicus.And he blames Pittacus, I went on, for saying not, as Protagoras holds, the same as himself, but something different.  For what Pittacus said was not, as Simonides said, that it is hard to become but to be good.  Now being and becoming, Protagoras, as our friend Prodicus says, are not the same thing;  and if being and becoming are not the same thing, Simonides does not contradict himself.  Perhaps Prodicus\n    and many others might say with Hesiod that to become good is hard, When Prodicus heard this he gave me his approval:  but Protagoras observed:  Your correction, Socrates, contains an error greater than that which you are correcting.To which I answered:  then it is a bad piece of work I have done, it would seem, Protagoras, and I am an absurd sort of physician;\nmy treatment increases the malady.Just so, he said.How is that?  I asked.Great, he replied, would be the ignorance of the poet, if he calls it such a slight matter to possess virtue, which is the hardest thing in the world, as all men agree.Then I remarked:  Upon my word, how opportunely it has happened that Prodicus is here to join in our discussion!  For it is very likely, Protagoras, that Prodicus' wisdom is a gift of long ago from heaven,\nbeginning either in the time of Simonides or even earlier.  But you, so skilled in many other things, appear to be unskilled in this, and lack the skill that I can boast because I am a disciple of the great Prodicus;  and so now I find you do not understand that perhaps Simonides did not conceive hard in the way that you conceive itjust as, in the case of awful, Prodicus here corrects me each time I use the word in praising you or someone else;  when I say, for instance, that\nProtagoras is an awfully wise man, he asks if I am not ashamed to call good things awful.  For awful, he says, is bad;  thus no one on this or that occasion speaks of awful wealth or awful peace or awful health, but we say awful disease, awful war or awful poverty, taking awful to be bad.  So perhaps hard also was intended by the Ceans and Simonides as either bad or something else that you do not understand:  let us therefore ask Prodicus, for it is fair to question him on the dialect of Simonides.\nWhat did Simonides mean, Prodicus, by hard?Bad, he replied.Then it is on this account, Prodicus, I said, that he blames Pittacus for saying it is hard to be good, just as though he heard him say it is bad to be good.Well, Socrates, he said, what else do you think Simonides meant?  Was he not reproaching Pittacus for not knowing how to distinguish words correctly, Lesbian as he was, and nurtured in a foreign tongue?You hear, Protagoras, I said,\nwhat Prodicus here suggests:  have you anything to say upon it?The case, said Protagoras, is far otherwise, Prodicus:  I am quite sure that Simonides meant by hard the same as we generally donot bad, but whatever is not easy and involves a great amount of trouble.Ah, I agree with you, Protagoras, I said, that this is Simonides' meaning, and that our friend Prodicus knows it, but is joking and chooses to experiment on you to see if you will be able to support your own statement.  For that Simonides does not mean\nthat hard is bad we have clear proof forthwith in the next phrase, where he saysSurely he cannot mean that it is bad to be good, if he proceeds here to say that God alone can have this thing, and attributes this privilege to God only; otherwise Prodicus would call Simonides a rake, and no true Cean.  But I should like to tell you what I take to be Simonides' intention in this ode, if you care to test my powers,\nas you put it, in the matter of verses;  though if you would rather, I will hear your account.When Protagoras heard me say thisAs you please, Socrates, he said;  then Prodicus and Hippias strongly urged me, and the rest of them also.Well then, I said, I will try to explain to you my own feeling about this poem.  Now philosophy is of more ancient and abundant growth in  and  than in any other part of ,\nand sophists are more numerous in those regions:  but the people there deny it and make pretence of ignorance, in order to prevent the discovery that it is by wisdom that they have ascendancy over the rest of the Greeks, like those sophists of whom Protagoras was speaking;  they prefer it to be thought that they owe their superiority to fighting and valor, conceiving that the revelation of its real cause would lead everyone to practise this wisdom. So well have they kept their secret that they have deceived the followers of the Spartan cult in our cities, with the result that some get broken ears\nby imitating them, bind their knuckles with thongs, go in for muscular exercises, and wear dashing little cloaks, as though it were by these means that the Spartans were the masters of .  And when the Spartans wish to converse unrestrainedly with their sophists, and begin to chafe at the secrecy of their meetings, they pass alien acts against the laconizing set and any other strangers within their gates, and have meetings with the sophists unknown to the foreigners;  while on their part they do not permit any of their young men\nto travel abroad to the other citiesin this rule they resemble the Cretanslest they unlearn what they are taught at home.  In those two states there are not only men but women also who pride themselves on their education;  and you can tell that what I say is true and that the Spartans have the best education in philosophy and argument by this:  if you choose to consort with the meanest of Spartans,\nat first you will find him making a poor show in the conversation;  but soon, at some point or other in the discussion, he gets home with a notable remark, short and compresseda deadly shot that makes his interlocutor seem like a helpless child.  Hence this very truth has been observed by certain persons both in our day and in former timesthat the Spartan cult is much more the pursuit of wisdom than of athletics;  for they know that a man's ability\nto utter such remarks is to be ascribed to his perfect education.  Such men were Thales of , Pittacus of , Bias of , Solon of our city, Cleobulus of , Myson of Chen, and, last of the traditional seven, Chilon of .  All these were enthusiasts, lovers and disciples of the Spartan culture;  and you can recognize that character in their wisdom by the short, memorable sayings that fell from each of them they assembled together\nand dedicated these as the first-fruits of their lore to Apollo in his Delphic temple, inscribing there those maxims which are on every tongueKnow thyself and Nothing overmuch.  To what intent do I say this?  To show how the ancient philosophy had this style of laconic brevity;  and so it was that the saying of Pittacus was privately handed about with high approbation among the sagesthat it is hard to be good.\nThen Simonides, ambitious to get a name for wisdom, perceived that if he could overthrow this saying, as one might some famous athlete, and become its conqueror, he would win fame himself amongst men of that day.  Accordingly it was against this saying, and with this aim, that he composed the whole poem as a means of covertly assailing and abasing this maxim, as it seems to me.Now let us all combine in considering whether my account is really true.  The opening of the ode must at once appear crazy if, while intending to say that\nit is hard for a man to become good, he inserted indeed.  There is no sort of sense, I imagine, in this insertion, unless we suppose that Simonides is addressing himself to the saying of Pittacus as a disputant:  Pittacus saysIt is hard to be good;  and the poet controverts this by observingNo, but to become good, indeed, is hard for a man, Pittacus, trulynot truly good;  he does not mention truth in this connexion,\nor imply that some things are truly good, while others are good but not truly so:  this would seem silly and unlike Simonides.  We must rather take the truly as a poetical transposition, and first quote the saying of Pittacus in some such way as this:  let us suppose Pittacus himself to be speaking and Simonides replying, as thusGood people, he says, it is hard to be good;  and the poet answersPittacus,\nwhat you say is not true, for it is not being but becoming good, indeedin hands and feet and mind foursquare, fashioned without reproachthat is truly hard.  In this way we see a purpose in the insertion of indeed, and that the truly is correctly placed at the end;  and all that comes after corroborates this view of his meaning.  There are many points in the various expressions of the poem\nwhich might be instanced to show its fine composition, for it is a work of very elegant and elaborate art;  but it would take too long to detail all its beauties.  However, let us go over its general outline and intention, which is assuredly to refute Pittacus' saying, throughout the ode.Proceeding a little way on from our passage, just as though he were making a speech, he says to become, indeed, a good man is truly hard (not but what it is possible for a certain space of time);  but to continue in this state of what one has become,\nand to be a good man is, as you say, Pittacus, impossible, superhuman:  God alone can have this privilegeNow who is it that an irresistible mischance overthrows in the command of a ship?  Clearly not the ordinary man, for he may be overcome at any time;  just as you cannot knock over one who is lying down, but one who is standing;  you might knock over a standing man so as to make him lie down,\nnot one who is lying down already.  So it is a man apt to resist that an irresistible mischance would overthrow, and not one who could never resist anything.  A great storm breaking over a steersman will render him helpless, and a severe season will leave a farmer helpless, and a doctor will be in the same case.  For the good has the capacity of becoming bad, as we have witness in another poet who saidwhereas the bad man has no capacity for becoming, but must ever be, what he is;\nso that when an irresistible mischance overthrows him who is resourceful, wise, and good, he cannot but be bad;  and you say, Pittacus, that it is hard to be goodthat is, to become good, indeed, is hard, though possible, but to be good is impossible:  forNow what is good faring in lettersthe thing\nthat makes a man good at them?  Clearly, the study of letters.  What welfare makes a good doctor? Clearly, the study of the cure of the ailing.  Bad, if ill:  who could become a bad doctor?  Clearly, he who in the first place is a doctor, and in the second, a good doctor;  for he could become a bad one also:  whereas we, who are laymen in respect of medicine, could never by faring ill become either doctors or joiners or anything else of that sort;\nand if one cannot become a doctor by faring ill, clearly one cannot become a bad one either.  In the same way the good man may one day become bad through the effect either of time or work or illness or some other accident;  for there is only one sort of ill farethe deprivation of knowledge.  But the bad man can never become bad:  he is that always.  If he is to become bad, he must previously become good.  Hence the upshot of this part of the poem\nis that it is impossible to be a good man, continuing to be good, but possible to become good, and bad also, in the case of the same person.  And thenAll this has been said with reference to Pittacus, as is made still plainer by the ensuing verses, in which he sayssays he;\nand in this vehement tone he pursues the saying of Pittacus all through the poem: This also is spoken with the same intent.  For Simonides was not so ill-educated as to say that he praised a person who willingly did no evil, as though there were some who did evil willingly.  I am fairly sure of thisthat none of the wise men considers that anybody ever willingly errs\nor willingly does base and evil deeds;  they are well aware that all who do base and evil things do them unwillingly;  and so Simonides does not say he gives his praise to the person who willingly does no evil, but uses the word willingly of himself.  For he considered that a man of sense and honor often constrains himself\nto become a friend and approver of some person, as when a man chances to have an uncongenial mother or father or country or other such connexion.  Now when this sort of thing befalls the wicked, they seem glad to see their parents' or country's faults, and complainingly point them out and inveigh against them, in order that their own neglect of them may not be denounced by their neighbors, who might otherwise reproach them for being so neglectful;  and hence they multiply\ntheir complaints and add voluntary to unavoidable feuds.  But good men, he knew, conceal the trouble and constrain themselves to praise, and if they have any reason to be angered against their parents or country for some wrong done to them they pacify and conciliate their feelings, compelling themselves to love and praise their own people.  And many a time, I think, Simonides was conscious that he had praised and eulogized some tyrant or other such person, not willingly,\nbut under compulsion.  So he proceeds to tell PittacusI, Pittacus, do not reproach you merely because I am apt to reproach, since for to blame I am not apt.  By this he does not mean to say, as it were, that all things are white\nthat have no admixture of black;  that would be ridiculous in many ways;  but that he himself accepts the average sort without reproaching them.  I do not seek, said he, a man wholly blameless amongst us who partake of the fruit of the broad-based earth:  if I light upon him, be sure I will report itmeaning, If I wait for that, I shall never find anyone to praise.  No, I am content if a man be average and do nothing evil, since I love and praise alland there he has used a Mytilenaean word, for his\nI praise and love all willingly is addressed to Pittacus (here at willingly one should make a pause);all who commit nothing base, but some there are whom I praise and love unwillingly.  Hence I should never reproach you, Pittacus, if you would only speak what is moderately reasonable and true.\nBut as it is, since you lie so grievously about the greatest matters with an air of speaking the truth, on this score I reproach you.Such is my view, Prodicus and Protagoras, I said, of Simonides' intention in composing this ode.Then Hippias remarked:  It certainly seems to me, Socrates, that you have given a good exposition of the poem:  but I also have an elegant discourse upon it,\nwhich I will perform for you if you wish.Yes, Hippias, said Alcibiades, but some other time:  for the moment the proper thing, according to the agreement which Protagoras and Socrates made between them, will be for Socrates to answer any questions that Protagoras may still wish to put to him, but if he prefers to answer Socrates, then it will be for Socrates to ask.On this I remarked:  For my part I place it in Protagoras's hands to do whichever he likes best.\nBut if he does not mind, let us talk no more of poems and verses, but consider the points on which I questioned you at first, Protagoras, and on which I should be glad to reach, with your help, a conclusion.  For it seems to me that arguing about poetry is comparable to the wine-parties of common market-folk.  These people, owing to their inability to carry on a familiar conversation over their wine by means of their own voices and discussions\nsuch is their lack of educationput a premium on flute-girls by hiring the extraneous voice of the flute at a high price, and carry on their intercourse by means of its utterance.  But where the party consists of thorough gentlemen who have had a proper education, you will see neither flute-girls nor dancing-girls nor harp-girls, but only the company contenting themselves with their own conversation, and none of these fooleries and frolicseach speaking and listening decently in his turn,\neven though they may drink a great deal of wine.  And so a gathering like this of ours, when it includes such men as most of us claim to be, requires no extraneous voices, not even of the poets, whom one cannot question on the sense of what they say;  when they are adduced in discussion we are generally told by some that the poet thought so and so, and by others, something different, and they go on arguing about a matter which they are powerless to determine.  No, this sort of meeting is avoided by men of culture,\nwho prefer to converse directly with each other, and to use their own way of speech in putting one another by turns to the test.  It is this sort of person that I think you and I ought rather to imitate;  putting the poets aside, let us hold our discussion together in our own persons, making trial of the truth and of ourselves.  So if you wish to question me further, I am at your service as answerer;  but if you like, put yourself at my service, so that we may clear up the several points of the inquiry in which we stopped half-way.\nOn my saying this and something more of the sort, Protagoras gave no indication as to which course he would take.  So Alcibiades, looking at Callias, said:  Do you consider, Callias, that Protagoras is behaving properly now in refusing to signify whether he will or will not answer?  I do not think he is.  Let him either debate or say that he does not want to debate, so that we may have this understanding with him;  then Socrates can debate with someone else, or another of us with some other,\nas may be agreed.Then Protagoras was ashamed, as it seemed to me, at these words of Alcibiades, and the more so when Callias requested him, together with almost the whole of the company;  and so he reluctantly prevailed on himself to take up the debate, and asked to have questions put to him, since he was ready to answer.So I proceeded to sayProtagoras, do not suppose that I have any other desire in debating with you than to examine the difficulties which occur to myself at each point.  For I hold that there is a good deal in what Homer says\nfor somehow it makes all of us human beings more resourceful in every deed or word or thought;  but if one observes something alone, forthwith one has to go about searching until one discovers somebody to whom one can show it off and who can corroborate it. And I also have my reason for being glad to debate with you rather than with anyone else;  it is that I regard you as the best person to investigate in general any matters\nthat a sensible man may be expected to examine, and virtue in particular.  Whom else should I choose but you?  Not only do you consider yourself a worthy gentleman, like sundry other people, who are sensible enough themselves, but cannot make others so;  but you are both good yourself and have the gift of making others good.  And you are so confident of yourself that, while others make a secret of this art, you have had yourself\npublicly proclaimed to all the Greeks with the title of sophist, and have appointed yourself preceptor of culture and virtue, and are the first who has ever demanded a regular fee for such work.  What then could I do but call upon you to deal with our problem both by question and communication?  I had no other course.  So now with regard to those points which I have raised on the subject in my opening questions, I desire to be reminded of some\nby you and to have your help in investigating others.  The question, I believe, was this:  Are the five names of wisdom, temperance, courage, justice, and holiness attached to one thing, or underlying each of these names is there a distinct existence or thing that has its own particular function, each thing being different from the others?  And your answer was that they are not names attached to one thing,\nbut that each of these names applies to a distinct thing, and that all these are parts of virtue;  not like the parts of gold, which are similar to each other and to the whole of which they are parts, but like the parts of the face, dissimilar to the whole of which they are parts and to each other, and each having a distinct function.  If you still hold the same opinion of them, say so;  if you have a new one, define what it is, for I make no objection to your replying now on other lines.  Indeed I should not be surprised\nif you were merely experimenting upon me when you spoke before.Well, Socrates, he replied, I say that all these are parts of virtue, and that while four of them are fairly on a par with each other, courage is something vastly different from all the rest.  You may perceive the truth of what I say from this:  you will find many people extremely unjust, unholy, dissolute, and ignorant, and yet pre-eminently courageous.\nStop now, I said:  we must duly examine what you say.  Do you call courageous men bold, or something else?Yes, and impetuous also, he replied, where most men fear to tread.Well now, do you say that virtue is a good thing, and of this good thing offer yourself as teacher?Nay, it is the best of things, he said, unless I am out of my senses.Then is one part of it base and another good, or is the whole good?Surely the whole is good in the highest possible degree.Now do you know who\ndive boldly into wells?   I do;  divers.Is this because they have knowledge, or for some other reason?Because they have knowledge.And who are bold in going to war on horsebackthose who are practised horsemen, or those who are not?Practised horsemen.And who with bucklersbuckler-men, or those who are not?Buckler-men:  and so with all other cases, he went on, if that is your point;  those who have knowledge are bolder than those who lack it, and individually they are bolder when they have learnt\nthan before learning.But you must have seen at times, I said, persons who are without knowledge of any of these affairs, yet behaving boldly in each of them.I have, he said, and very boldly too.   Then are these bold ones courageous also?Nay, that would make courage a base thing, he replied;  for those you speak of are out of their senses.What then, I asked, do you mean by courageous men?  Surely the same as bold men?\nYes, I do still, he said.Then these men, I went on, who are so brave, are found to be not courageous but mad?  And in those former cases our wisest men are boldest too, and being boldest are most courageous?  And on this reasoning, wisdom will be courage?You do not rightly recall, Socrates, what I stated in replying to you.  When you asked me whether courageous men are bold, I admitted it:  I was not asked whether bold men are courageous.  Had you asked me this before, I should have said\nNot all.  And as to proving that courageous men are not bold, you have nowhere pointed out that I was wrong in my admission that they are.  Next you show that such persons individually are bolder when they have knowledge, and bolder than others who lack it, and therewith you take courage and wisdom to be the same:  proceeding in this manner you might even take strength to be wisdom.  On this method you might begin by asking me whether the strong are powerful, and I should say Yes;\nand then, whether those who know how to wrestle are more powerful than those who do not know how to wrestle, and whether individually they are more powerful when they have learnt than before learning, and I should say Yes.  And on my admitting these points it would be open to you to say, by the same token, that according to my admission wisdom is strength.  But neither there nor elsewhere do I admit that the powerful are strong, only that the strong are powerful;  for I hold that power and strength\nare not the same, but that one of them, power, comes from knowledge, or from madness or rage, whereas strength comes from constitution and fit nurture of the body.  So, in the other instance, boldness and courage are not the same, and therefore it results that the courageous are bold, but not that the bold are courageous;  for boldness comes to a man from art, or\nfrom rage or madness, like power, whereas courage comes from constitution and fit nurture of the soul.Do you speak of some men, Protagoras, I asked, as living well, and others ill?Yes.Then do you consider that a man would live well if he lived in distress and anguish?No, he said.Well now, if he lived pleasantly and so ended his life, would you not consider he had thus contrived to live well?I would, he said.And, I suppose, to live pleasantly is good,\nand unpleasantly, bad?Yes, he said, if one lived in the enjoyment of honorable things.But, Protagoras, will you tell me you agree with the majority in calling some pleasant things bad and some painful ones good?  I mean to sayAre not things good in so far as they are pleasant, putting aside any other result they may have;  and again, are not painful things in just the same sense badin so far as they are painful?I cannot tell, Socrates, he replied, whether I am to answer, in such absolute fashion as that of your question,\nthat all pleasant things are good and painful things bad:  I rather think it safer for me to reply, with a view not merely to my present answer but to all the rest of my life, that some pleasant things are not good, and also that some painful things are not bad, and some are, while a third class of them are indifferentneither bad nor good.You call pleasant, do you not, I asked, things that partake of pleasure or\ncause pleasure?Certainly, he said.So when I put it to you, whether things are not good in so far as they are pleasant, I am asking whether pleasure itself is not a good thing.Let us examine the matter, Socrates, he said, in the form in which you put it at each point, and if the proposition seems to be reasonable, and pleasant and good are found to be the same, we shall agree upon it;  if not, we shall dispute it there and then.And would you like, I asked, to be leader in the inquiry, or am I to lead?You ought to lead, he replied, since you are the inaugurator of this discussion.Well then,\nI proceeded, will the following example give us the light we need?  Just as, in estimating a man's health or bodily efficiency by his appearance, one might look at his face and the lower part of his arms and say:  Come now, uncover your chest too and your back and show them, that I may examine you thoroughlyso the same sort of desire comes over me in regard to our inquiry.  Observing your condition to be as you describe in respect of the good and the pleasant, I am fain to say something like this:  Come, my good Protagoras, uncover some more of your thoughts:\nhow are you in regard to knowledge?  Do you share the view that most people take of this, or have you some other?  The opinion generally held of knowledge is something of this sortthat it is no strong or guiding or governing thing;  it is not regarded as anything of that kind, but people think that, while a man often has knowledge in him, he is not governed by it, but by something elsenow by passion, now by pleasure, now by pain, at times by love, and often by fear;  their feeling about knowledge\nis just what they have about a slave, that it may be dragged about by any other force.  Now do you agree with this view of it, or do you consider that knowledge is something noble and able to govern man, and that whoever learns what is good and what is bad will never be swayed by anything to act otherwise than as knowledge bids, and that intelligence is a sufficient succor for mankind?My view, Socrates, he replied, is precisely that which you express,\nand what is more, it would be a disgrace for me above all men to assert that wisdom and knowledge were aught but the highest of all human things.Well and truly spoken, I said.  Now you know that most people will not listen to you and me, but say that many, while knowing what is best, refuse to perform it, though they have the power, and do other things instead.  And whenever I have asked them to tell me what can be the reason of this, they say that those who act so are acting under the influence of pleasure or pain,\nor under the control of one of the things I have just mentioned.Yes, Socrates, he replied, I regard this as but one of the many erroneous sayings of mankind.Come then, and join me in the endeavor to persuade the world and explain what is this experience of theirs, which they call being overcome by pleasure, and which they give as the reason why they fail to do what is best though they have knowledge of it.  For perhaps if we said to them:  What you assert, good people, is not correct, but quite untruethey might ask us:  Protagoras and Socrates, if this experience is not being overcome by pleasure\nwhat on earth is it, and what do you call it?  Tell us that.Why, Socrates, must we consider the opinion of the mass of mankind,\nwho say just what occurs to them?I fancy, I replied, that this will be a step towards discovering how courage is related to the other parts of virtue.  So if you think fit to abide by the arrangement we made a while agothat I should lead in the direction which seems best for elucidating the matteryou must now follow;  but if you would rather not, to suit your wishes I will let it pass.No, he said, your plan is quite right:  go on to the end as you began.\nOnce more then, I proceeded, suppose they should ask us:  Then what do you call this thing which we described as being overcome by pleasures?  The answer I should give them would be this:  Please attend;  Protagoras and I will try to explain it to you.  Do you not say that this thing occurs, good people, in the common case of a man being overpowered by the pleasantness of food or drink or sexual acts, and doing what he does though he knows it to be wicked?  They would admit it.  Then you and I would ask them again:  In what sense do you call such deeds wicked?\nIs it that they produce those pleasures and are themselves pleasant at the moment, or that later on they cause diseases and poverty, and have many more such ills in store for us?  Or, even though they have none of these things in store for a later day, and cause us only enjoyment, would they still be evil just because, forsooth, they cause enjoyment in some way or other?  Can we suppose, Protagoras, that they will make any other answer than that these things are evil, not according to the operation of the actual pleasure\nof the moment, but owing to the later results in disease and those other ills?I think, said Protagoras, that most people would answer thus.Then in causing diseases they cause pains?  And in causing poverty they cause pains?\nThey would admit this, I imagine.Protagoras agreed.Then does it seem to you, my friends, as Protagoras and I assert, that the only reason why these things are evil is that they end at last in pains, and deprive us of other pleasures?  Would they admit this?We both agreed that they would.Then again, suppose we should ask them the opposite:  You, sirs, who tell us on the other hand that good things are painfuldo you not give such instances as physical training, military service, and medical treatment conducted by cautery, incision, drugs, or starvation, and say that these are good, but painful?  Would they not grant it?\nHe agreed that they would.Then do you call them good because they produce extreme pangs and anguish for the moment, or because later on they result in health and good bodily condition, the deliverance of cities, dominion over others, and wealth?  They would assent to this, I suppose.He agreed.And are these things good for any other reason than that they end at last in pleasures and relief and riddance of pains?  Or have you some other end to mention,\nwith respect to which you call them good, apart from pleasures and pains?  They could not find one, I fancy.I too think they could not, said Protagoras.Then do you pursue pleasure as being a good thing, and shun pain as being a bad one?He agreed that we do.So one thing you hold to be badpain;  and pleasure you hold to be good, since the very act of enjoying you call bad as soon as it deprives us of greater pleasures than it has in itself, or leads to greater pains than the pleasures it contains.\nFor if it is with reference to something else that you call the act of enjoyment bad, and with a view to some other end, you might be able to tell it us but this you will be unable to do.I too think that they cannot, said Protagoras.Then is not the same thing repeated in regard to the state of being pained?  You call being pained a good thing as soon as it either rids us of greater pains than those it comprises, or leads to greater pleasures than its pains.  Now if you have in view some other end\nthan those which I mention when you call being pained good, you can tell it us;  but you never can.Truly spoken, said Protagoras.Once more then, I proceeded;  if you were to ask me, my friends, Now why on earth do you speak at such length on this point, and in so many ways?  I should reply, Forgive me:  in the first place, it is not easy to conclude what it is that you mean when you say overcome by pleasures;  and secondly, on this point hang all our conclusions.  But it is still quite possible to retract, if you can somehow contrive to say that\nthe good is different from pleasure, or the bad from pain.  Is it enough for you to live out your life pleasantly, without pain?  If it is, and you are unable to tell us of any other good or evil that does not end in pleasure or pain, listen to what I have to say next.  I tell you that if this is so, the argument becomes absurd, when you say that it is often the case that a man, knowing the evil to be evil, nevertheless commits it, when he might avoid it, because he is driven and dazed\nby his pleasures;  while on the other hand you say that a man, knowing the good, refuses to do good because of the momentary pleasures by which he is overcome.The absurdity of all this will be manifest if we refrain from using a number of terms at once, such as pleasant, painful, good, and bad;  and as there appeared to be two things, let us call them by two namesfirst, good and evil, and then later on, pleasant and painful.  Let us then lay it down as our statement,\nthat a man does evil in spite of knowing the evil of it.  Now if someone asks us:  Why? we shall answer:  Because he is overcome.  By what? the questioner will ask us and this time we shall be unable to reply:  By pleasurefor this has exchanged its name for the good.  So we must answer only with the words:  Because he is overcome.  By what? says the questioner.  The goodmust surely be our reply.  Now if our questioner chance to be an arrogant person he will laugh and exclaim:  What a ridiculous statement,\nthat a man does evil, knowing it to be evil, and not having to do it, because he is overcome by the good!  Is this, he will ask, because the good is not worthy of conquering the evil in you, or because it is worthy? Clearly we must reply:  Because it is not worthy;  otherwise he whom we speak of as overcome by pleasures would not have offended.  But in what sense, he might ask us, is the good unworthy of the bad, or the bad of the good?  This can only be when the one is greater and the other smaller, or when there are more on the one side and fewer on the other.  We shall not find\nany other reason to give; So it is clear, he will say, that by being overcome you mean getting the greater evil in exchange for the lesser good.  That must be agreed.  Then let us apply the terms pleasant and painfulto these things instead, and say that a man does what we previously called evil, but now call painful, knowing it to be painful, because he is overcome by the pleasant, which is obviously\nunworthy to conquer.  What unworthiness can there be in pleasure as against pain, save an excess or defect of one compared with the other?  That is, when one becomes greater and the other smaller, or when there are more on one side and fewer on the other, or here a greater degree and there a less.  For if you should say:  But, Socrates, the immediately pleasant differs widely from the subsequently pleasant or painful, I should reply:  Do they differ in anything but pleasure and pain?\nThat is the only distinction.  Like a practised weigher, put pleasant things and painful in the scales, and with them the nearness and the remoteness, and tell me which count for more.  For if you weigh pleasant things against pleasant, the greater and the more are always to be preferred:  if painful against painful, then always the fewer and smaller.  If you weigh pleasant against painful, and find that the painful are outbalanced by the pleasantwhether the near by the remote or the remote by the nearyou must take that course of action to which the pleasant are attached;\nbut not that course if the pleasant are outweighed by the painful.  Can the case be otherwise, I should ask, than thus, my friends?  I am certain they could state no alternative.To this he too assented.Since that is the case, then, I shall say, please answer me this:  Does not the same size appear larger to your sight when near, and smaller when distant?  They will admit this.  And it is the same with thickness and number?  And sounds of equal strength are greater when near, and smaller when distant?\nThey would agree to this.  Now if our welfare consisted in doing and choosing things of large dimensions, and avoiding and not doing those of small, what would be our salvation in life?  Would it be the art of measurement, or the power of appearance?  Is it not the latter that leads us astray, as we saw, and many a time causes us to take things topsy-turvy and to have to change our minds both in our conduct and in our choice of great or small? Whereas the art of measurement would have made this appearance ineffective,\nand by showing us the truth would have brought our soul into the repose of abiding by the truth, and so would have saved our life.  Would men acknowledge, in view of all this, that the art which saves our life is measurement, or some other?It is measurement, he agreed.Well now, if the saving of our life depended on the choice of odd or even, and on knowing when to make a right choice of the greater and when of the lesstaking each by itself or comparing it with the other, and whether near\nor distantwhat would save our life?  Would it not be knowledge;  a knowledge of measurement, since the art here is concerned with excess and defect, and of numeration, as it has to do with odd and even?  People would admit this, would they not?Protagoras agreed that they would.Well then, my friends, since we have found that the salvation of our life depends on making a right choice of pleasure and painof the more and the fewer,\nthe greater and the smaller, and the nearer and the remoteris it not evident, in the first place, that measurement is a study of their excess and defect and equality in relation to each other?This must needs be so.And being measurement, I presume it must be an art or science?They will assent to this.Well, the nature of this art or science we shall consider some other time;  but the mere fact of its being a science will suffice for the proof which Protagoras and I\nare required to give in answer to the question you have put to us.  You asked it, if you remember, when we were agreeing that there is nothing stronger than knowledge, and that knowledge, wherever it may be found, has always the upper hand of pleasure or anything else;  and then you said that pleasure often masters even the man of knowledge, and on our refusing to agree with you, you went on to ask us:  Protagoras and Socrates, if this experience is not being overcome by pleasure,\nwhatever can it be, and what do you call it?  Tell us.  If on the spur of the moment we had replied, Ignorance, you would have laughed us to scorn:  but now if you laugh at us you will be laughing at yourselves as well.  For you have admitted that it is from defect of knowledge that men err, when they do err, in their choice of pleasures and painsthat is, in the choice of good and evil;  and from defect not merely of knowledge but of the knowledge which you have now admitted also to be that of measurement.  And surely you know well enough for yourselves\nthat the erring act committed without knowledge is done through ignorance. Accordingly to be overcome by pleasure means just thisignorance in the highest degree, which Protagoras here and Prodicus and Hippias profess to cure.  But you, through supposing it to be something else than ignorance, will neither go yourselves nor send your children to these sophists, who are the teachers of those thingsyou say it cannot be taught;  you are chary of your money and will give them none,\nand so you fare badly both in private and in public life.Such would have been our answer to the world at large.  And I ask you now, Hippias and Prodicus, as well as Protagorasfor I would have you make a joint replywhether you think what I say is true or false.They all thought what I had said was absolutely true.Then you agree, I continued, that the pleasant is good and the painful bad.  And let me entreat my friend Prodicus to spare me his distinction of terms:\nfor whether you say pleasant or delightful or enjoyable, my excellent Prodicus, or in whatever style or manner you may be pleased to name these things, pray reply to the sense of my question.At this Prodicus laughed and consented, as did the rest.Well now, my friends, I said, what of this?  All actions aimed at living painlessly and pleasantly are honorable, are they not?  And the honorable work is both good and useful?They agreed.Then if, I proceeded, the pleasant is good, no one who has knowledge\nor thought of other actions as better than those he is doing, and as possible, will do as he proposes if he is free to do the better ones;  and this yielding to oneself is nothing but ignorance, and mastery of oneself is as certainly wisdom.They all agreed.Well then, by ignorance do you mean having a false opinion and being deceived about matters of importance?They all agreed to this also.Then surely, I went on, no one willingly goes after evil or what he thinks to be evil;\nit is not in human nature, apparently, to do soto wish to go after what one thinks to be evil in preference to the good;  and when compelled to choose one of two evils, nobody will choose the greater when he may the lesser.All this met with the assent of everyone.Well, I said, is there something you call dread, or fear?  And is itI address myself to you, Prodicus the same as I have in mindsomething I describe as an expectation of evil, whether you call it fear or dread?Protagoras and Hippias agreed\nto this description of dread or fear;  but Prodicus thought this was dread, not fear.No matter, Prodicus, I said, but my point is this:  if our former statements are true, will any man wish to go after what he dreads, when he may pursue what he does not?  Surely this is impossible after what we have admittedthat he regards as evil that which he dreads?  And what is regarded as evil is neither pursued nor accepted willingly, we saw, by anyone.\nHere also they were all in agreement.So much, then, being granted, Prodicus and Hippias, I said, let our friend Protagoras vindicate the correctness of the answer he made at firstnot that which he made at the very beginning, when he said that, while there were five parts of virtue, none of them was like any other, but each had its particular function:  I do not refer to that, but the statement he made afterwards, when he proceeded to say that four of them had a considerable resemblance to each other,\nbut one was quite different from the restcourage;  and he told me I should perceive this by the following token:  You will find, Socrates, said he, that men may be most unholy, most unjust, most dissolute, and most ignorant, yet most courageous;  whence you may judge that courage is very different from the other parts of virtue.  His answer caused me great surprise at the moment, and still more when I went into the matter with your help.  But anyhow, I asked him whether by the brave he meant bold.  Yes, he replied, and impetuous.\nProtagoras, I said, do you remember making this answer?He admitted he did.Well now, I said, tell us, towards what do you mean they are impetuous when they are courageous?  Towards the same things as cowards?No, he said.Then towards other things?Yes, he said.Do cowards go after things that allow boldness, and the courageous after dreadful things?So people say, Socrates.Quite true, I said.  But my point is rather,\ntowards what, according to you, are the brave impetuous?  Dreadful things, in the belief that they are dreadful, or towards what is not dreadful?No, he said;  the former has just been shown, by the arguments you put forward, to be impossible.Quite true again, I said;  so that if this proof was correct, no one goes to meet what he regards as dreadful, since to be overcome by oneself was found to be ignorance.He admitted this.And yet all men go also to meet what they can face boldly, whether cowardly or brave, and in this respect cowardly and brave\ngo to meet the same things.But still, Socrates, he said, what cowards go to meet is the very opposite of what the courageous go to meet.  For instance, the latter are willing to go to war, but the former are not.Is going to war an honorable thing, I asked, or a base thing?Honorable, he replied.Then if it is honorable, we have admitted, by our former argument, that it is also good for we agreed that all honorable actions were good.True, and I abide by that decision.You are right to do so, I said.\nBut which sort of men do you say are not willing to go to war, that being an honorable and good thing to do?The cowardly, he replied.Then, I went on, if it is honorable and good, is it also pleasant?That certainly has been admitted, he said.Now do the cowards wittingly refuse to go to what is more honorable, better, and pleasanter?Well, if we admit that too, he replied, we shall undo our previous admissions.But what of the courageous man?  Does he not go to the more honorable and better and pleasanter?\nI am forced to admit that, he said.Now, in general, courageous men do not feel base fears, when they fear, nor is there anything base in their boldness?True, he said.And if not base, then it must be honorable?He admitted this.And if honorable, then good?Yes.And the cowardly and the bold and the mad, on the contrary, feel base fears and base boldness?He agreed.Do they feel base and evil boldness solely through stupidity and ignorance?\nJust so, he said.Well now, the cause of cowards being cowardly, do you call this cowardice or courage?Cowardice, I call it, he replied.And were they not found to be cowards through ignorance of what is dreadful?Certainly, he said.And so they are cowards because of that ignorance? He agreed.And the cause of their being cowards is admitted by you to be cowardice?He assented.Then ignorance of what is dreadful and not dreadful will be cowardice?He nodded assent.But surely courage, I went on,\nis the opposite of cowardice.Yes.Then the wisdom that knows what is and what is not dreadful is opposed to the ignorance of these things?To this he could still nod assent.   And the ignorance of them is cowardice?   To this he nodded very reluctantly.So the wisdom that knows what is and what is not dreadful is courage, being opposed to the ignorance of these things?Here he could no longer bring himself to nod agreement, and remained silent.  Then I proceeded:  Why is it, Protagoras, that you neither affirm nor deny what I ask you?Finish it, he said, by yourself.\nI must first ask you, I said, just one more question:  Do you still think, as at the beginning, that there are any people who are most ignorant and yet most courageous?I see, Socrates, you have set your heart on making me your answerer;  so, to oblige you, I will say that by what we have admitted I consider it impossible.My only motive, I then said, in asking all these questions has been a desire to examine the various relations of virtue and its own special nature.\nFor I know that, were it once made plain, that other question on which you and I have argued at such length on either sideyou maintaining and I denying that virtue can be taughtwould be cleared up satisfactorily.  Our discussion, in its present result, seems to me as though it accused and mocked us like some human person;  if it were given a voice it would say:  What strange creatures you are, Socrates and Protagoras!  You on the one hand, after having said at first that virtue cannot be taught,\nare now hot in opposition to yourself, endeavoring to prove that all things are knowledgejustice, temperance, and couragewhich is the best way to make virtue appear teachable:  for if virtue were anything else than knowledge, as Protagoras tried to make out, obviously it would not be teachable;  but if as a matter of fact it turns out to be entirely knowledge, as you urge, Socrates, I shall be surprised if it is not teachable.  Protagoras, on the other hand, though at first he claimed that it was teachable,\nnow seems as eager for the opposite, declaring that it has been found to be almost anything but knowledge, which would make it quite unteachable!  Now I, Protagoras, observing the extraordinary tangle into which we have managed to get the whole matter, am most anxious to have it thoroughly cleared up.  And I should like to work our way through it until at last we reach what virtue is, and then go back and consider whether it is teachable or not, lest perchance your Epimetheus beguile and trip us up in our investigation\nas he overlooked us in your account of his distribution.  I like the Prometheus of your fable better than the Epimetheus;  for he is of use to me, and I take Promethean thought continually for my own life when I am occupied with all these questions;  so, with your consent, as I said at the beginning, I should be delighted to have your aid in the inquiry.I approve your zeal, Socrates, said Protagoras, and the way you develop your arguments;\nfor I think I am not ill-natured, and I am the last person on earth to be envious.  Indeed I have told many people how I regard youas the man I admire far above any that I meet, and as quite an exception to men of your age;  and I say I should not be surprised if you won high repute for wisdom.  We shall pursue the subject on some other occasion, at your pleasure:  for the present,\nit is time to turn to another affair.I quite agree, said I, if you think so:  for I was long ago due to be where I told you I was going;  I stayed merely to oblige our excellent Callias.Here our colloquy ended, and each went his way."}}]}}, {"@n": "Gorg.", "body": {"head": "Gorgias", "castList": {"castItem": [{"@type": "role", "role": "Callicles"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Socrates"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Chaerephon"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Gorgias"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Polus"}]}, "milestone": [{"@unit": "page", "@n": "447"}, {"@n": "447a", "@unit": "section"}], "sp": [{"speaker": "Callicles", "p": "To join in a fight or a fray, as the saying is, Socrates, you have chosen your time well enough."}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": "Do you mean, according to the proverb, we have come too late for a feast?"}, {"speaker": "Callicles", "p": "Yes, a most elegant feast;  for Gorgias gave us a fine and varied display but a moment ago."}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": {"milestone": {"@n": "447b", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "But indeed, Callicles, it is Chaerephon here who must take the blame for this; \nhe forced us to spend our time in the market-place."}}, {"speaker": "Chaerephon", "p": "No matter, Socrates I will take the curing of it too for Gorgias is a friend of mine, so that he will give us a display now, if you think fit, or if you prefer, on another occasion."}, {"speaker": "Callicles", "p": "What, Chaerephon?

And I further declare that, if a rhetorician and a doctor were to enter any city you please, and there had to contend in speech before the Assembly or some other meeting as to which of the two should be appointed physician, you would find the physician was nowhere,\nwhile the master of speech would be appointed if he wished.  And if he had to contend with a member of any other profession whatsoever, the rhetorician would persuade the meeting to appoint him before anyone else in the place:  for there is no subject on which the rhetorician could not speak more persuasively than a member of any other profession whatsoever, before a multitude.  So great, so strange, is the power of this art.  At the same time, Socrates, our use of rhetoric should be like our use of any other sort of exercise. \nFor other exercises are not to be used against all and sundry, just because one has learnt boxing or wrestling or fighting in armour so well as to vanquish friend and foe alike:  this gives one no right to strike one's friends, or stab them to death.  Nor, in all conscience, if a man took lessons at a wrestling-school, and having got himself into good condition and learnt boxing he proceeded to strike his father and mother, or some other of his relations or friends, should that be a reason for\nhating athletic trainers and teachers of fighting in armour, and expelling them from our cities.  For they imparted their skill with a view to its rightful use against enemies and wrongdoers,\nin self-defence, not provocation;  whereas the others have perverted their strength and art to an improper use.  So it is not the teachers who are wicked, nor is the art either guilty or wicked on this account, but rather, to my thinking, those who do not use it properly.  Now the same argument applies also to rhetoric:  for the orator is able, indeed, to speak against every one and on every question in such a way as to win over the votes of the multitude, practically in any matter he may choose to take up: \nbut he is no whit the more entitled to deprive the doctors of their credit, just because he could do so, or other professionals of theirs;  he must use his rhetoric fairly, as in the case of athletic exercise.  And, in my opinion, if a man becomes a rhetorician and then uses this power and this art unfairly, we ought not to hate his teacher and cast him out of our cities.  For he imparted\nthat skill to be used in all fairness, whilst this man puts it to an opposite use.

There are two different affairs to which I assign two different arts:  the one, which has to do with the soul, I call politics;  the other, which concerns the body, though I cannot give you a single name for it offhand, is all one business, the tendance of the body, which I can designate in two branches as gymnastic and medicine.  Under politics I set legislation in the place of gymnastic, and justice to match medicine. \nIn each of these pairs, of coursemedicine and gymnastic, justice and legislationthere is some intercommunication, as both deal with the same thing;  at the same time they have certain differences.  Now these four, which always bestow their care for the best advantage respectively of the body and the soul, are noticed by the art of flattery which, I do not say with knowledge, but by speculation, divides herself into four parts, and then, insinuating herself into each of those branches,\npretends to be that into which she has crept, and cares nothing for what is the best, but dangles what is most pleasant for the moment as a bait for folly, and deceives it into thinking that she is of the highest value.  Thus cookery assumes the form of medicine, and pretends to know what foods are best for the body;  so that if a cook and a doctor had to contend before boys, or before men as foolish as boys, as to which of the two, the doctor or the cook, understands the question of sound and noxious foods,\nthe doctor would starve to death.  Flattery, however, is what I call it,\nand I say that this sort of thing is a disgrace, Polusfor here I address youbecause it aims at the pleasant and ignores the best;  and I say it is not an art, but a habitude, since it has no account to give of the real nature of the things it applies, and so cannot tell the cause of any of them.  I refuse to give the name of art to anything that is irrational:  if you dispute my views, I am ready to give my reasons. \nHowever, as I put it, cookery is flattery disguised as medicine;  and in just the same manner self-adornment personates gymnastic:  with its rascally, deceitful, ignoble, and illiberal nature it deceives men by forms and colors, polish and dress so as to make them, in the effort of assuming an extraneous beauty, neglect the native sort that comes through gymnastic.  Well, to avoid prolixity, I am willing to put it to you like a geometerfor by this time I expect you can follow me: \nas self-adornment is to gymnastic, so is sophistry to legislation;  and as cookery is to medicine, so is rhetoric to justice.  But although, as I say, there is this natural distinction between them, they are so nearly related that sophists and orators are jumbled up as having the same field and dealing with the same subjects, and neither can they tell what to make of each other, nor the world at large what to make of them.  For indeed, if the soul were not in command of the body, but the latter had charge of itself, and so cookery and medicine were not surveyed\nand distinguished by the soul, but the body itself were the judge, forming its own estimate of them by the gratifications they gave it, we should have a fine instance of what Anaxagoras described, my dear Polus,for you are versed in these matters:  everything would be jumbled together, without distinction as between medicinal and healthful and tasty concoctions.  Well now, you have heard what I state rhetoric to bethe counterpart of cookery in the soul, acting here as that does on the body.  It may, indeed, be absurd of me,\nwhen I do not allow you to make long speeches, to have extended mine to so considerable a length.  However, I can fairly claim indulgence:  for when I spoke briefly you did not understand me;  you were unable to make any use of the answer I gave you, but required a full exposition.  Now if I on my part cannot tell what use to make of any answers you may give me, you shall extend your speech also; \nbut if I can make some use of them, allow me to do it;  that will only be fair.

For he said, I think, when you asked Gorgias whether, supposing a man came to him with no knowledge of justice but a desire to learn rhetoric, he would instruct the man,\nGorgias showed some shame and said he would, because of the habit of mind in people which would make them indignant if refusedand  so, because of this admission, he was forced to contradict himself, and that was just what suited youand Polus was right, to my thinking, in mocking at you as he did then;  but this time he has got into the very same plight himself.  For my own part, where I am not satisfied with Polus is just that concession he made to youthat doing wrong\nis fouler than suffering it;  for owing to this admission he too in his turn got entangled in your argument and had his mouth stopped, being ashamed to say what he thought.  For you, Socrates, really turn the talk into such low, popular clap-trap, while you give out that you are pursuing the truthinto stuff that is fair, not by nature, but by convention.  Yet for the most part these twonature and conventionare opposed to each other, so that if a man is ashamed and dares not say what he thinks, he is forced\n\nto contradict himself.  And this, look you, is the clever trick you have devised for our undoing in your discussions:  when a man states anything according to convention you slip according to nature into your questions;  and again, if he means nature, you imply convention.  In the present case, for instance, of doing and suffering wrong, when Polus was speaking of what is conventionally fouler, you followed it up in the sense of what is naturally so.  For by nature everything is fouler that is more evil, such as suffering wrong:  doing it is fouler only by convention.  Indeed this endurance of wrong done is not a man's part at all, but a poor slave's,\nfor whom it is better to be dead than alive, as it is for anybody who, when wronged or insulted, is unable to protect himself or anyone else for whom he cares.  But I suppose the makers of the laws are the weaker sort of men, and the more numerous.  So it is with a view to themselves and their own interest that they make their laws and distribute their praises and censures; \nand to terrorize the stronger sort of folk who are able to get an advantage, and to prevent them from getting one over them, they tell them, that such aggrandizement is foul and unjust, and that wrongdoing is just this endeavor to get the advantage of one's neighbors:  for I expect they are well content to see themselves on an equality, when they are so inferior.  So this is why by convention it is termed unjust and foul to aim at an advantage over the majority,\nand why they call it wrongdoing:  but nature, in my opinion, herself proclaims the fact that it is right for the better to have advantage of the worse, and the abler of the feebler.  It is obvious in many cases that this is so, not only in the animal world, but in the states and races, collectively, of menthat right has been decided to consist in the sway and advantage of the stronger over the weaker.  For by what manner of right did Xerxes\nmarch against , or his father against ?  Or take the countless other cases of the sort that one might mention.  Why, surely these men follow naturethe nature of rightin acting thus;  yes, on my soul, and follow the law of naturethough not that, I dare say, which is made by us;  we mold the best and strongest amongst us, taking them from their infancy like young lions, and utterly enthral them by our spells\nand witchcraft, telling them the while that they must have but their equal share, and that this is what is fair and just.  But, I fancy, when some man arises with a nature of sufficient force, he shakes off all that we have taught him, bursts his bonds, and breaks free;  he tramples underfoot our codes and juggleries, our charms and laws, which are all against nature;  our slave rises in revolt and shows himself our master, and there\ndawns the full light of natural justice.  And it seems to me that Pindar adds his evidence to what I say, in the ode where he sayswhich, so he continues,the words are something like thatI do not know the poem wellbut it tells how he drove off the cows\nas neither a purchase nor a gift from Geryones;  taking it as a natural right that cows ar any other possessions of the inferior and weaker should all belong to the superior and stronger. Well, that is the truth of the matter;  and you will grasp it if you will now put philosophy aside and pass to greater things.  For philosophy, you know, Socrates, is a charming thing, if a man has to do with it moderately in his younger days;  but if he continues to spend his time on it too long, it is ruin to any man.  However well endowed one may be, if one philosophizes far on into life, one must needs find oneself\nignorant of everything that ought to be familiar to the man who would be a thorough gentleman and make a good figure in the world.  For such people are shown to be ignorant of the laws of their city, and of the terms which have to be used in negotiating agreements with their fellows in private or in public affairs, and of human pleasures and desires;  and, in short, to be utterly inexperienced in men's characters.  So when they enter upon any private or public business they make themselves ridiculous, just as on the other hand, I suppose, when public men\nengage in your studies and discussions, they are quite ridiculous.  The fact is, as Euripides has it\nwhereas that in which he is weak he shuns and vilifies;  but the other he praises, in kindness to himself, thinking in this way to praise himself also.  But the most proper course, I consider, is to take a share of both.  It is a fine thing to partake of philosophy just for the sake of education, and it is no disgrace for a lad to follow it:  but when a man already advancing in years continues in its pursuit, the affair, Socrates, becomes ridiculous;  and for my part I have much the same feeling\ntowards students af philosophy as towards those who lisp or play tricks.  For when I see a little child, to whom it is still natural to talk in that way, lisping or playing some trick, I enjoy it, and it strikes me as pretty and ingenuous and suitable to the infant's age;  whereas if I hear a small child talk distinctly, I find it a disagreeable thing, and it offends my ears and seems to me more befitting a slave.  But when one hears a grown man lisp,\nor sees him play tricks, it strikes one as something ridiculous and unmanly, that deserves a whipping.  Just the same, then, is my feeling towards the followers of philosophy.  For when I see philosophy in a young lad I approve of it;  I consider it suitable, and I regard him as a person of liberal mind:  whereas one who does not follow it I account illiberal and never likely to expect of himself any fine or generous action. \nBut when I see an elderly man still going on with philosophy and not getting rid of it, that is the gentleman, Socrates, whom I think in need of a whipping.  For as I said just now, this person, however well endowed he may be, is bound to become unmanly through shunning the centers and marts of the city, in which, as the poet said, men get them note and glory;  he must cower down and spend the rest of his days whispering in a corner with three or four lads, and never utter anything free or high or spirited. \nNow I, Socrates, am quite fairly friendly to you, and so I feel very much at this moment as Zethus did, whom I have mentioned, towards Amphion in Euripides.  Indeed I am prompted to address you in the same sort of words as he did his brother:  You neglect, Socrates, what you ought to mind;  you distort with a kind of boyish travesty a soul of such noble nature; \nand neither will you bring to the counsels of justice any rightly spoken word, nor will you accept any as probable or convincing, nor advise any gallant plan for your fellow.  And yet, my dear Socratesnow do not be annoyed with me, for I am going to say this from goodwill to youdoes it not seem to you disgraceful to be in the state I consider you are in, along with the rest of those who are ever pushing further into philosophy?  For as it is, if somebody should seize hold of you or anyone else at all of your sort, and drag you off to prison, asserting that you were guilty of a wrong you had never done, you know you would be at a loss what to do with yourself, and would be all dizzy\nand agape without a word to say;  and when you came up in court, though your accuser might be ever so paltry a rascal, you would have to die if he chose to claim death as your penalty.  And yet what wisdom is there, Socrates, in an art that found a man of goodly parts and made him worse, unable either to succor himself, or to deliver himself or anyone else from the greatest dangers, but like\nto be stripped by his enemies of all his substance, and to live in his city as an absolute outcast?  Such a person, if one may use a rather low expression, can be given a box on the ear with impunity.  No, take my advice, my good sir, and cease refuting;  some practical proficiency induce,something that will give you credit for sense:  to others leave these pretty toys,call them vaporings or fooleries as you will,\nwhich will bring you to inhabit empty halls;  and emulate, not men who probe these trifles, but who have means and repute and other good things in plenty."}}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": {"milestone": {"@n": "486e", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "If my soul had happened to be made of gold, Callicles, do you not think I should have been delighted to find one of those stones with which they test gold, and the best one;  which, if I applied it, and it confirmed to me that my soul had been properly tended, would give me full assurance that I am in a satisfactory state and\nhave no need of other testing?"}}, {"speaker": "Callicles", "p": "What is the point of that question, Socrates?"}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": "I will tell you.

I meet with many people who are unable to test me, because they are not wise as you are;  while others, though wise, are unwilling to tell me the truth, because they do not care for me as you do;  and our two visitors here,\nGorgias and Polus, though wise and friendly to me, are more lacking in frankness and inclined to bashfulness than they should be:  nay, it must be so, when they have carried modesty to such a point that each of them can bring himself, out of sheer modesty, to contradict himself in face of a large company, and that on questions of the greatest importance.  But you have all these qualities which the rest of them lack:  you have had a sound education, as many here in  will agree;  and you are well disposed to me.  You ask what proof I have?  I will tell you. \nI know, Callicles, that four of you have formed a partnership in wisdomyou, Tisander of Aphidnae, , son of Androtion, and Nausicydes of Cholarges; and I once overheard you debating how far the cultivation of wisdom should be carried, and I know you were deciding in favor of some such view as thisthat one should not be carried away into the minuter points of philosophy, but you exhorted one another\nto beware of making yourselves overwise, lest you should unwittingly work your own ruin.

And further, as to your ability to speak out frankly and not be bashful, you not only claim this yourself, but you are borne out too by the speech that you made a short while ago.  Well, this is clearly the position of our question at present: \nif you can bear me out in any point arising in our argument, that point can at once be taken as having been amply tested by both you and me, and there will be no more need of referring it to a further test;  for no defect of wisdom or access of modesty could ever have been your motive in making this concession, nor again could you make it to deceive me:  for you are my friend, as you say yourself.  Hence any agreement between you and me must really have attained the perfection of truth.  And on no themes could one make more honorable inquiry, Callicles, than on those which you have reproached me withwhat character one should have,\nand what should be one's pursuits and up to what point, in later as in earlier years.  For I assure you that if there is any fault of conduct to be found in my own life it is not an intentional error, but due to my ignorance:  so I ask you not to break off in the middle of your task of admonishing me, but to make fully clear to me what it is that I ought to pursue and by what means I may attain it;  and if you find me in agreement with you now, and afterwards failing to do what I agreed to,\nregard me as a regular dunce and never trouble any more to admonish me againa mere good-for-nothing.

And again, when he does what is fitting\nas regards men, his actions will be just, and as regards the gods, pious;  and he who does what is just and pious must needs be a just and pious man.  That is so.  And surely he must be brave also:  for you know a sound or temperate mind is shown, not by pursuing and shunning what one ought not, but by shunning and pursuing what one ought, whether they be things or people or pleasures or pains, and by steadfastly persevering in one's duty;  so that it follows of strict necessity,\nCallicles, that the temperate man, as shown in our exposition, being just and brave and pious, is the perfection of a good man;  and that the good man does well and fairly whatever he does and that he who does well is blessed and happy, while the wicked man or evil-doer is wretched.  And this must be the man who is in an opposite case to the temperate,the licentious man whom you were commending.So there is my account of the matter, and I say that this is the truth;  and that, if this is true, anyone, as it seems,\nwho desires to be happy must ensue and practice temperance, and flee from licentiousness, each of us as fast as his feet will carry him, and must contrive, if possible, to need no correction;  but if he have need of it, either himself or anyone belonging to him, either an individual or a city, then right must be applied and they must be corrected, if they are to be happy.  This, in my opinion, is the mark on which a man should fix his eyes throughout life;  he should concentrate all his own and his city's efforts on this one business of providing\na man who would be blessed with the needful justice and temperance;  not letting one's desires go unrestrained and in one's attempts to satisfy theman interminable troubleleading the life of a robber.  For neither to any of his fellow-men can such a one be dear, nor to God;  since he cannot commune with any, and where there is no communion, there can be no friendship.  And wise men tell us, Callicles, that heaven and earth\nand gods and men are held together by communion and friendship, by orderliness, temperance, and justice;  and that is the reason, my friend, why they call the whole of this world by the name of order, not of disorder or dissoluteness.  Now you, as it seems to me, do not give proper attention to this, for all your cleverness, but have failed to observe the great power of geometrical equality amongst both gods and men:  you hold that self-advantage is what one ought to practice, because you neglect geometry.  Very well:  either we must refute this statement, that it is by the possession\nof justice and temperance that the happy are happy and by that of vice the wretched are wretched;  or if this is true, we must investigate its consequences.  Those former results, Callicles, must all follow, on which you asked me if I was speaking in earnest when I said that a man must accuse himself or his son or his comrade if he do any wrong, and that this is what rhetoric must be used for;  and what you supposed Polus to be conceding from shame is after all true\nthat to do wrong is worse, in the same degree as it is baser, than to suffer it, and that whoever means to be the right sort of rhetorician must really be just and well-informed of the ways of justice, which again Polus said that Gorgias was only shamed into admitting.This being the case, let us consider what weight, if any, there is in the reproaches you cast upon me: is it fairly alleged or not that I am unable to stand up for myself or any of my friends and relations, or to deliver them from the sorest perils, but am exposed like an outcast to the whim of anyone who chooses to give me\nthe dashing phrase is yoursa box on the ear;  or strip me of my substance or expel me from the city;  or, worst of all, put me to death;  and that to be in such a case is the lowest depth of shame, as your account has it?  But minethough it has been frequently stated already, there can be no objection to my stating it once againis this:  I deny, Callicles, that to be wrongfully boxed on the ear\nis the deepest disgrace, or to have either my person cut or my purse;  I hold that to strike or cut me or mine wrongfully is yet more of a disgrace and an evil, and likewise stealing and kidnapping and housebreaking, and in short any wrong whatsoever done to me or mine, are both worse and more shameful to the wrongdoer than to me the wronged.  All this, which has been made evident in the form I have stated some way back in our foregoing discussion,\nis held firm and fastenedif I may put it rather bluntlywith reasons of steel and adamant (so it would seem, at least, on the face of it) which you or somebody more gallant than yourself must undo, or else accept this present statement of mine as the only possible one.  For my story is ever the same, that I cannot tell how the matter stands, and yet of all whom I have encountered, before as now, no one has been able to state it otherwise without making himself ridiculous.  Well now, once more I assume it to be so; \nbut if it is so, and injustice is the greatest of evils to the wrongdoer, and still greater than this greatest, if such can be, when the wrongdoer pays no penalty, what rescue is it that a man must be able to effect for himself if he is not to be ridiculous in very truth?  Is it not one which will avert from us the greatest harm?  Nay, rescue must needs be at its shamefullest, if one is unable to rescue either oneself or one's own friends and relations,\nand second to it is inability in face of the second sort of evil, and third in face of the third, and so on with the rest;  according to the gravity attaching to each evil is either the glory of being able to effect a rescue from each sort, or the shame of being unable.

But if this seems to you too small a thing, I will tell you of a more important one,\nthe art of piloting, which saves not only our lives but also our bodies and our goods from extreme perils, as rhetoric does.  And at the same time it is plain-fashioned and orderly, not giving itself grand airs in a pretence of performing some transcendent feat;  but in return for performing the same as the forensic artbringing one safely over, it may be, from Aeginait charges a fee, I believe, of two obols;  or if it be from Egypt or the Pontus, at the very mostfor this great service\nof bringing safe home, as I said just now, oneself and children and goods and womenfolkon landing charges a couple of drachmae;  the actual possessor of the art, after performing all this, goes ashore and strolls on the quay by his vessel's side, with an unobtrusive demeanor.  For he knows, I expect, how to estimate the uncertainty as to which of his passengers he has benefited by not letting them be lost at sea, and which he has injured, being aware that he has put them ashore not a whit better than when they came aboard,\neither in body or in soul.  And so he reckons out how wrong it is that, whereas a victim of severe and incurable diseases of the body who has escaped drowning is miserable in not having died, and has got no benefit at his hands, yet, if a man has many incurable diseases in that part of him so much more precious than the body, his soul, that such a person is to live, and that he will be doing him the service of saving him either from the sea or from a law court or from any other peril whatsoever:  no,\nhe knows it cannot be better for a man who is vicious to live, since he must needs live ill.This is why it is not the custom for the pilot to give himself grand airs, though he does save our lives;  nor for the engineer either, my admirable friend, who sometimes has the power of saving lives in no less degree than a generalto say nothing of a pilotor anyone else:  for at times he saves whole cities.  Can you regard him as comparable with the lawyer?  And yet, if he chose to speak as you people do, Callicles, magnifying his business, he would bury you in a heap of words,\npleading and urging the duty of becoming engineers, as the only thing;  for he would find reasons in plenty.  But you none the less despise him and his special art, and you would call him engineer in a taunting sense, and would refuse either to bestow your daughter on his son or let your own son marry his daughter.  And yet after the praises you sing of your own pursuits what fair ground have you for despising the engineer and the others whom I was mentioning just now?  I know\nyou would claim to be a better man and of better birth.  But if better has not the meaning I give it, but virtue means just saving oneself and one's belongings, whatever one's character may be, you are merely ridiculous in cavilling at the engineer and the doctor and every other art that has been produced for our safety.  No, my gifted friend, just see if the noble and the good are not something different from saving and being saved.  For as to living any particular length of time, this is surely a thing that any true man\nshould ignore, and not set his heart on mere life;  but having resigned all this to Heaven and believing what the women saythat not one of us can escape his destinyhe should then proceed to consider in what way he will best live out his allotted span of life;  whether in assimilating himself to the constitution of the state in which he may be dwelling\nand so therefore now, whether it is your duty to make yourself as like as possible to the Athenian people, if you intend to win its affection and have great influence in the city:  see if this is to your advantage and mine, so that we may not suffer, my distinguished friend, the fate that they say befalls the creatures who would draw down the moonthe hags of Thessaly; that our choice of this power in the city may not cost us all that we hold most dear.  But if you suppose that anyone in the world can transmit to you such an art as will cause you\nto have great power in this state without conforming to its government either for better or for worse, in my opinion you are ill-advised, Callicles;  for you must be no mere imitator, but essentially like them, if you mean to achieve any genuine sort of friendship with Demus the Athenian people, ay, and I dare swear, with Demus son of Pyrilampes as well.  So whoever can render you most like them is the person to make you a statesman in the way that you desire to be a statesman, and a rhetorician; \nfor everybody is delighted with words that are designed for his special temper, but is annoyed by what is spoken to suit aliensunless you have some other view, dear creature.

But in diverting her desires another way instead of complying with themin persuading or compelling her people to what would help them to be better\nthey were scarcely, if at all, superior to their  successors;  and that is the only business of a good citizen.  But in providing ships and walls and arsenals, and various other things of the sort, I do grant you that they were cleverer than our leaders.  Thus you and I are doing an absurd thing in this discussion:  for during all the time that we have been debating we have never ceased circling round to the same point and misunderstanding each other.  I at all events believe you have more than once admitted and decided that this management\nof either body or soul is a twofold affair, and that on one side it is a menial service, whereby it is possible to provide meat for our bodies when they are hungry, drink when thirsty, and when they are cold, clothing,  bedding, shoes, or anything else that bodies are apt to desire:  I purposely give you the same illustrations, in order that you may the more easily comprehend.  For as to being able to supply these things, either as a tradesman or a merchant or a  manufacturer of any such actual thingsbaker or cook\nor weaver or shoemaker or tannerit is no wonder that a man in such capacity should appear to himself and his neighbors to be a minister of the body;  to every one, in fact, who is not aware that there is besides all these an art of gymnastics and medicine which really is, of course, ministration to the body, and which actually has a proper claim to rule over all those arts and to make use of their works, because it knows what is wholesome or harmful in meat and drink\nto bodily excellence, whereas all those others know it not;  and hence it is that, while those other arts are slavish and menial and illiberal in dealing with the body, gymnastics and medicine can fairly claim to be their mistresses.  Now, that the very same is the case as regards the soul you appear to me at one time to understand to be my meaning, and you admit it as though you knew what I meant;  but a little later you come and tell me that men have shown themselves upright and honorable citizens in our city, and when I ask you\nwho, you seem to me to be putting forward men of exactly the same sort in public affairs;  as if, on my asking you who in gymnastics have ever been or now are good trainers of the body, you were to tell me, in all seriousness, Thearion, the baker, Mithaecus, the author of the book on Sicilian cookery, Sarambus, the vintnerthese have shown themselves wonderful ministers of the body; \nthe first providing admirable loaves, the second tasty dishes, and the third wine.  Now perhaps you would be indignant should I then say to you:  Sir, you know nothing about gymnastics;  servants you tell me of, and caterers to appetites, fellows who have no proper and respectable knowledge of them, and who peradventure will first stuff and fatten men's bodies to the tune of their praises, and then cause them to lose even the flesh they had to start with; \nand these in their turn will be too ignorant to cast the blame of their maladies and of their loss of original weight upon their regalers, but any people who chance to be by at the time and offer them some advicejust when the previous stuffing has brought, after the lapse of some time, its train of disease, since it was done without regard to what is wholesomethese are the people they will accuse and chide and harm as far as they can, while they will sing the praises of that former crew who caused the mischief. \nAnd you now, Callicles, are doing something very similar to this:  you belaud men who have regaled the citizens with all the good cheer they desired.  People do say they have made the city great;  but that it is with the swelling of an imposthume, due to those men of the former time, this they do not perceive. \nFor with no regard for temperance and justice they have stuffed the city with harbors and arsenals and walls and tribute and suchlike trash;  and so whenever that access of debility comes they will lay the blame on the advisers who are with them at the time, and belaud Themistocles and Cimon and Pericles, who caused all the trouble;  and belike they will lay hold of you, if you are not on your guard, and my good friend Alcibiades, when they are losing what they had originally\nas well as what they have acquired, though you are not the authors, except perhaps part-authors, of the mischief.  And yet there is a senseless thing which I see happening now, and hear of, in connection with the men of former times.  For I observe that whenever the state proceeds against one of her statesmen as a wrongdoer, they are indignant and protest loudly against such monstrous treatment:  after all their long and valuable services to the state they are unjustly ruined at her hands, so they protest.  But the whole thing is a lie;  since there is not a single case\nin which a ruler of a city could ever be unjustly ruined by the very city that he rules.  For it is very much the same with pretenders to statesmanship as with professors of sophistry.  The sophists, in fact, with all their other accomplishments, act absurdly in one point:  claiming to be teachers of virtue, they often accuse their pupils of doing them an injury by cheating them of their fees and otherwise showing no recognition of the good they have done them. \nNow what can be more unreasonable than this plea?  That men, after they have been made good and just, after all their injustice has been rooted out by their teacher and replaced by justice, should be unjust through something that they have not!

Od. 11.569"}, "#text": "Give ear then, as they say, to a right fine story, which you will regard as a fable, I fancy, but I as an actual account;  for what I am about to tell you I mean to offer as the truth.  By Homer's account, Zeus, Poseidon, and Pluto divided the sovereignty amongst them when they took it over from their father.  Now in the time of Cronos there was a law concerning mankind, and it holds to this very day amongst the gods, that every man who has passed a just and holy life departs after his decease\nto the Isles of the Blest, and dwells in all happiness apart from ill;  but whoever has lived unjustly and impiously goes to the dungeon of requital and penance which, you know, they call Tartarus.  Of these men there were judges in Cronos' time, and still of late in the reign of Zeusliving men to judge the living upon the day when each was to breathe his last;  and thus the cases were being decided amiss.  So Pluto and the overseers from the Isles of the Blest came before Zeus with the report that they found men passing over to either abode undeserving. \nThen spake Zeus:  Nay, said he, I will put a stop to these proceedings.  The cases are now indeed judged ill and it is because they who are on trial are tried in their clothing, for they are tried alive.  Now many, said he, who have wicked souls are clad in fair bodies and ancestry and wealth, and at their judgement appear many witnesses to testify that their lives have been just.  Now, the judges are confounded not only by their evidence\nbut at the same time by being clothed themselves while they sit in judgement, having their own soul muffled in the veil of eyes and ears and the whole body.  Thus all these are a hindrance to them, their own habiliments no less than those of the judged.  Well, first of all, he said, we must put a stop to their foreknowledge of their death;  for this they at present foreknow.  However, Prometheus has already been given the word\nto stop this in them.  Next they must be stripped bare of all those things before they are tried;  for they must stand their trial dead.  Their judge also must be naked, dead, beholding with very soul the very soul of each immediately upon his death, bereft of all his kin and having left behind on earth all that fine array, to the end that the judgement may be just.  Now I, knowing all this before you, have appointed sons of my own to be judges;  two from Asia, Minos and Rhadamanthus,\nand one from Europe, Aeacus.  These, when their life is ended, shall give judgement in the meadow at the dividing of the road, whence are the two ways leading, one to the Isles of the Blest, and the other to Tartarus.  And those who come from Asia shall Rhadamanthus try, and those from Europe, Aeacus;  and to Minos I will give the privilege of the final decision, if the other two be in any doubt;  that the judgement upon this journey of mankind may be supremely just.This, Callicles, is what I have heard and believe to be true; \nand from these stories, on my reckoning, we must draw some such moral as this:  death, as it seems to me, is actually nothing but the disconnection of two things, the soul and the body, from each other.  And so when they are disconnected from one another, each of them keeps its own condition very much as it was when the man was alive, the body having its own nature, with its treatments and experiences all manifest upon it.  For instance,\nif anyone's body was large by nature or by feeding or by both when he was alive, his corpse will be large also when he is dead;  and if he was fat, it will be fat too after his death, and so on for the rest;  or again, if he used to follow the fashion  of long hair, long-haired also will be his corpse. Again, if anyone had been a sturdy rogue, and bore traces of his stripes in scars on his body, either from the whip or from other wounds, while yet alive, then after death too his body has these marks visible upon it;  or if anyone's limbs were broken or distorted in life, these same effects are manifest in death. \nIn a word, whatever sort of bodily appearance a man had acquired in life, that is manifest also after his death either wholly or in the main for some time.  And so it seems to me that the same is the case with the soul too, Callicles:  when a man's soul is stripped bare of the body, all its natural gifts, and the experiences added to that soul as the result of his various pursuits, are manifest in it.   So when they have arrived\nin presence of their judge, they of Asia before Rhadamanthus, these Rhadamanthus sets before him and surveys the soul of each, not knowing whose it is;  nay, often when he has laid hold of the Great King or some other prince or potentate, he perceives the utter unhealthiness of his soul, striped all over with the scourge, and a mass of wounds, the work of perjuries and injustice; \nwhere every act has left its smirch upon his soul, where all is awry through falsehood and imposture, and nothing straight because of a nurture that knew not truth:  or, as the result of an unbridled course of fastidiousness, insolence, and incontinence, he finds the soul full fraught with disproportion and ugliness.  Beholding this he sends it away in dishonor straight to the place of custody, where on its arrival it is to endure the sufferings that are fitting. \nAnd it is fitting that every one under punishment rightly inflicted on him by another should either be made better and profit thereby, or serve as an example to the rest, that others seeing the sufferings he endures may in fear amend themselves.  Those who are benefited by the punishment they get from gods and men are they who have committed remediable offences;  but still it is through bitter throes of pain that they receive their benefit both here and in the nether world; \nfor in no other way can there be riddance of iniquity.  But of those who have done extreme wrong and, as a result of such crimes, have become incurable, of those are the examples made;  no longer are they profited at all themselves, since they are incurable, but others are profited who behold them undergoing for their transgressions the greatest, sharpest, and most fearful sufferings evermore, actually hung up as examples there in the infernal dungeon, a spectacle and a lesson to such of the wrongdoers\nas arrive from time to time.  Among them I say Archelaus also will be found, if what Polus tells us is true, and every other despot of his sort.  And I think, moreover, that most of these examples have come from despots and kings and potentates and public administrators;  for these, since they have a free hand, commit the greatest and most impious offences.  Homer also testifies to this;  for he has represented kings and potentates\nas those who are punished everlastingly in the nether worldTantalus and Sisyphus and Tityus;  but Thersites, or any other private person who was wicked, has been portrayed by none as incurable and therefore subjected to heavy punishment;  no doubt because he had not a free hand, and therefore was in fact happier than those who had.  For in fact, Callicles, it is among the powerful\nthat we find the specially wicked men.  Still there is nothing to prevent good men being found even among these, and it deserves our special admiration when they are; for it is hard, Callicles, and deserving of no slight praise, when a man with a perfectly free hand for injustice lives always a just life.  The men of this sort are but few;  for indeed there have been, and I expect there yet will be, both here and elsewhere, men of honor and excellence\nin this virtue of administering justly what is committed to their charge.  One in fact there has been whose fame stands high among us and throughout the rest of Greece, Aristeides, son of Lysimachus;  but most of those in power, my excellent friend, prove to be bad.  So, as I was saying, whenever the judge Rhadamanthus has to deal with such a one, he knows nothing else of him at all, neither who he is nor of what descent, but only that he is a wicked person and on perceiving this he sends him away to Tartarus, first setting a mark on him to show whether he deems it a curable or an incurable case; \nand when the man arrives there he suffers what is fitting.  Sometimes, when he discerns another soul that has lived a holy life in company with truth, a private man's or any othersespecially, as I claim, Callicles, a philosopher's who has minded his own business and not been a busybody in his lifetimehe is struck with admiration and sends it off to the Isles of the Blest.  And exactly the same is the procedure of Aeacus:  each of these two holds a rod in his hand as he gives judgement;  but Minor sits as supervisor, distinguished by the golden scepter that he holds,\nas Odysseus in Homer tells how he saw himNow for my part, Callicles, I am convinced by these accounts, and I consider how I may be able to show my judge that my soul is in the best of health.  So giving the go-by to the honors that most men seek I shall try, by inquiry into the truth, to be really good in as high a degree as I am able, both in my life and, when I come to die, in my death. \nAnd I invite all other men likewise, to the best of my power, and you particularly I invite in return, to this life and this contest, which I say is worth all other contests on this earth;  and I make it a reproach to you, that you will not be able to deliver yourself when your trial comes and the judgement of which I told you just now;  but when you go before your judge, the son of Aegina,\nand he grips you and drags you up, you will gape and feel dizzy there no less than I do here, and some one perhaps will give you, yes, a degrading box on the ear, and will treat you with every kind of contumely.Possibly, however, you regard this as an old wife's tale, and despise it;  and there would be no wonder in our despising it if with all our searching we could somewhere find anything better and truer than this:  but as it is, you observe that you three, who are the wisest of the Greeks in our dayyou and Polus and Gorgias\nare unable to prove that we ought to live any other life than this, which is evidently advantageous also in the other world.  But among the many statements we have made, while all the rest are refuted this one alone is unshakenthat doing wrong is to be more carefully shunned than suffering it;  that above all things a man should study not to seem but to be good both in private and in public;  that if one becomes bad in any respect one must be corrected;  that this is good in the second place,\nnext to being just, to become so and to be corrected by paying the penalty;  and that every kind of flattery, with regard either to oneself or to others, to few or to many, must be avoided;  and that rhetoric is to be used for this one purpose always, of pointing to what is just, and so in every other activity.  Take my advice, therefore, and follow me where, if you once arrive, you will be happy both in life and after life's end, as this account declares.  And allow anyone to contemn you as a fool and foully maltreat you if he chooses;  yes, by Heaven,\nand suffer undaunted the shock of that ignominious cuff;  for you will come to no harm if you be really a good and upright man, practicing virtue.  And afterwards, having practiced it together, we shall in due course, if we deem it right, embark on politics, or proceed to consult on whatever we may think fit, being then better equipped for such counsel than we are now.  For it is disgraceful that men in such a condition as we now appear to be in should put on a swaggering, important air when we never continue to be of the same mind upon the same questions,\nand those the greatest of allwe are so sadly uneducated.  Let us therefore take as our guide the doctrine now disclosed, which indicates to us that this way of life is bestto live and die in the practice alike of justice and of all other virtue.  This then let us follow, and to this invite every one else;  not that to which you trust yourself and invite me, for it is nothing worth, Callicles."}}]}}, {"@n": "Meno", "body": {"head": "Meno", "castList": {"castItem": [{"@type": "role", "role": "Meno"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Socrates"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Meno's Boy"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Anytus"}]}, "milestone": [{"@unit": "page", "@n": "70"}, {"@n": "70a", "@unit": "section"}], "sp": [{"speaker": "Meno", "p": "Can you tell me, Socrates, whether virtue can be taught, or is acquired by practice, not teaching?
