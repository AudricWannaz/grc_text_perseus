For, as I was saying just now, this is not an art in you, whereby you speak well on Homer, but a divine power, which moves you like that in the stone which Euripides named a magnet, but most people call  stone.  For this stone not only attracts iron rings, but also imparts to them a power whereby they in turn are able to do the very same thing as the stone,\nand attract other rings;  so that sometimes there is formed quite a long chain of bits of iron and rings, suspended one from another;  and they all depend for this power on that one stone.  In the same manner also the Muse inspires men herself, and then by means of these inspired persons the inspiration spreads to others, and holds them in a connected chain.  For all the good epic poets utter all those fine poems not from art, but as inspired and possessed, and the good lyric poets likewise; \njust as the Corybantian worshippers do not dance when in their senses, so the lyric poets do not indite those fine songs in their senses, but when they have started on the melody and rhythm they begin to be frantic, and it is under possessionas the bacchants are possessed, and not in their senses, when they draw honey and milk from the riversthat the soul of the lyric poets does the same thing, by their own report.  For the poets tell us, I believe, that the songs they bring us are the sweets they cull from honey-dropping founts\nin certain gardens and glades of the Museslike the bees, and winging the air as these do. And what they tell is true.  For a poet is a light and winged and sacred thing, and is unable ever to indite until he has been inspired and put out of his senses, and his mind is no longer in him:  every man, whilst he retains possession of that, is powerless to indite a verse or chant an oracle.  Seeing then that it is not by art that they compose and utter so many fine things about the deeds of men\nas you do about Homerbut by a divine dispensation, each is able only to compose that to which the Muse has stirred him, this man dithyrambs, another laudatory odes, another dance-songs, another epic or else iambic verse;  but each is at fault in any other kind.  For not by art do they utter these things, but by divine influence;  since, if they had fully learnt by art to speak on one kind of theme, they would know how to speak on all.  And for this reason God takes away the mind of these men and uses them as his ministers, just as he does soothsayers and godly seers,\nin order that we who hear them may know that it is not they who utter these words of great price, when they are out of their wits, but that it is God himself who speaks and addresses us through them.  A convincing proof of what I say is the case of Tynnichus, the Chalcidian, who had never composed a single poem in his life that could deserve any mention, and then produced the paean which is in everyone's mouth, almost the finest song we have, simplyas he says himselfan invention of the Muses.  For the god, as it seems to me,\nintended him to be a sign to us that we should not waver or doubt that these fine poems are not human or the work of men, but divine and the work of gods;  and that the poets are merely the interpreters of the gods, according as each is possessed by one of the heavenly powers.

One poet is suspended from one Muse, another from another: \nthe word we use for it is possessed, but it is much the same thing, for he is held.

Listen then.  In her speech, I believe, she began by making mention of the dead men themselves in this wise:In respect of deeds, these men have received at our hands what is due unto them, endowed wherewith they travel their predestined road;  for they have been escorted forth in solemn procession publicly by the City and privately by their kinsfolk.  But in respect of words, the honor that remains still due to these heroes the law enjoins us, and it is right, to pay in full. \nFor it is by means of speech finely spoken that deeds nobly done gain for their doers from the hearers the meed of memory and renown.  And the speech required is one which will adequately eulogize the dead and give kindly exhortation to the living, appealing to their children and their brethren to copy the virtues of these heroes, and to their fathers and mothers and any still surviving ancestors offering consolation. \nWhere then could we discover a speech like that?  Or how could we rightly commence our laudation of these valiant men, who in their lifetime delighted their friends by their virtue, and purchased the safety of the living by their deaths?  We ought, in my judgement, to adopt the natural order in our praise, even as the men themselves were natural in their virtue.  And virtuous they were because they were sprung from men of virtue.  Firstly, then, let us eulogize their nobility of birth, and secondly their nurture and training: \nthereafter we shall exhibit the character of their exploits, how nobly and worthily they wrought them.  Now as regards nobility of birth, their first claim thereto is thisthat the forefathers of these men were not of immigrant stock, nor were these their sons declared by their origin to be strangers in the land sprung from immigrants, but natives sprung from the soil living and dwelling in their own true fatherland;  and nurtured also by no stepmother, like other folk, but by that mother-country\nwherein they dwelt, which bare them and reared them and now at their death receives them again to rest in their own abodes.  Most meet it is that first we should celebrate that Mother herself;  for by so doing we shall also celebrate therewith the noble birth of these heroes.Our country is deserving of praise, not only from us but from all men, on many grounds, but first and foremost because she is god-beloved.  The strife of the gods who contended over her and their judgement testify to the truth of our statement. \nAnd how should not she whom the gods praised deserve to be praised by all mankind?  And a second just ground of praise would be this,that during that period in which the whole earth was putting forth and producing animals of every kind, wild and tame, our country showed herself barren and void of wild animals, but chose for herself and gave birth to man, who surpasses all other animals in intelligence and alone of animals regards justice and the gods. \nAnd we have a signal proof of this statement in that this land of ours has given birth to the forefathers both of these men and of ourselves.  For every creature that brings forth possesses a suitable supply of nourishment for its offspring;  and by this test it is manifest also whether a woman be truly a mother or no, if she possesses no founts of nourishment for her child.  Now our land, which is also our mother, furnishes to the full this proof of her having brought forth men;  for, of all the lands that then existed, she was the first and the only one to produce human nourishment,\nnamely the grain of wheat and barley, whereby the race of mankind is most richly and well nourished, inasmuch as she herself was the true mother of this creature.  And proofs such as this one ought to accept more readily on behalf of a country than on behalf of a woman;  for it is not the country that imitates the woman in the matter of conception and birth, but the woman the country.  But this her produce of grain she did not begrudge to the rest of men, but dispensed it to them also.  And after it she brought to birth for her children the olive, sore labor's balm.  And when she had nurtured and reared them up to man's estate,\nshe introduced gods to be their governors and tutors;  the names of whom it behoves us to pass over in this discourse, since we know them;  and they set in order our mode of life, not only in respect of daily business, by instructing us before all others in the arts, but also in respect of the guardianship of our country, by teaching us how to acquire and handle arms.Such being the manner of their birth and of their education, the ancestors of these men framed for themselves and lived under a civic polity\nwhich it is right for us briefly to describe.  For a polity is a thing which nurtures men, good men when it is noble, bad men when it is base.  It is necessary, then, to demonstrate that the polity wherein our forefathers were nurtured was a noble one, such as caused goodness not only in them but also in their descendants of the present age, amongst whom we number these men who are fallen.  For it is the same polity which existed then and exists now, under which polity we are living now and have been living ever since that age with hardly a break.  One man calls it democracy, another man, according to his fancy, gives it some other name;  but it is, in very truth,\nan aristocracy backed by popular approbation.  Kings we always have;  but these are at one time hereditary, at another selected by vote.  And while the most part of civic affairs are in the control of the populace, they hand over the posts of government and the power to those who from time to time are deemed to be the best men;  and no man is debarred by his weakness or poverty or by the obscurity of his parentage, or promoted because of the opposite qualities, as is the case in other States.  On the contrary, the one principle of selection is this:  the man that is deemed to be wise or good rules and governs.  And the cause of this\nour polity lies in our equality of birth.  For whereas all other States are composed of a heterogeneous collection of all sorts of people, so that their polities also are heterogeneous, tyrannies as well as oligarchies, some of them regarding one another as slaves, others as masters;  we and our people,\non the contrary, being all born of one mother, claim to be neither the slaves of one another nor the masters;  rather does our natural birth-equality drive us to seek lawfully legal equality, and to yield to one another in no respect save in reputation for virtue and understanding.Wherefore the forefathers of these men and of us, and these men themselves, having been reared up thus in complete freedom, and being nobly born, achieved before all men many noble deeds both individual and national,\ndeeming it their duty to fight in the cause of freedom alike with Greeks on behalf of Greeks and with barbarians on behalf of the whole of .  The story of how they repulsed Eumolpus and the Amazons, and still earlier invaders, when they marched upon our country, and how they defended the Argives against the Cadmeians and the Heracleidae against the Argives, is a story which our time is too short to relate as it deserves, and already their valor has been adequately celebrated in song by poets who have made it known throughout the world; \nconsequently, if we should attempt to magnify the same achievements in plain prose, we should probably find ourselves outmatched.  These exploits, therefore, for these reasons I judge that we should pass over, seeing also that they have their due meed of praise;  but those exploits for which as yet no poet has received worthy renown for worthy cause, and which lie still buried in oblivion, I ought, as I think, to celebrate, not only praising them myself but providing material also for others to build up into odes and other forms of poetry in a manner worthy of the doers of those deeds.  And of the deeds whereof I speak the first were these:\nThe Persians were in command of , and were enslaving , when they came in contact with the children of this land, our own parents, of whom it is right and proper that we should make mention first and celebrate their valor.  But if we are to celebrate it fitly, in order to visualize it we must place ourselves, in thought, at that epoch when the whole of  was already in bondage to the third of the Persian kings.  Cyrus, the first of these kings, had by his own spirited action set free his fellow-countrymen, the Persians, and not only enslaved the Medes, their masters,\nbut also gained command of the rest of , as far as to .  His son ruled over  and as much of  as he could traverse;  while the third king, Darius, extended his empire by land as far as to the Scythians, and by his navy controlled the sea and the islands,\nso that none so much as thought of disputing his sway.  Thus the minds of all men were enslaved;  so many were the mighty and warlike nations which had fallen under the yoke of the Persian Empire.  Then Darius, accusing us and the Eretrians of having plotted against , dispatched fifty myriads of men in transports and warships, together with three hundred ships of war, and Datis as their commander; \nand him the king ordered to bring back the Eretrians and Athenians in captivity, if he wished to keep his own head.  He then sailed to  against men who were amongst the most famous warriors in  at that time, and by no means few in number;  them he overpowered within three days, and lest any should escape he made a thorough search of the whole of their country and his method was this.  His soldiers marched to the limits of  and posted themselves at intervals from sea to sea; \nthen they joined hands and passed through the whole of the country, in order that they might be able to report to the king that not a man had escaped out of their hands. With the same design they sailed off from  to Marathon, supposing that they would have an easy task in leading the Athenians captive under the same yoke of bondage as the Eretrians.  And while these actions were being accomplished in part, and in part attempted, not one of the Greeks lent aid to the Eretrians nor yet to the Athenians, save only the Lacedaemonians (and they arrived on the day after the battle);  all the rest were terrorstricken, and, hugging their present security,\nmade no move.  It is by realizing this position of affairs that we can appreciate what manner of men those were, in point of valor, who awaited the onset of the barbarians' power, chastised all 's insolent pride, and were the first to rear trophies of victory over the barbarians;  whereby they pointed the way to the others and taught them to know that the Persian power was not invincible, since there is no multitude of men or money but courage conquers it. \nI, therefore, affirm that those men were the begetters not merely of our bodies but of our freedom also, and the freedom of all the dwellers in this continent;  for it was the example of that exploit of theirs which fired the Greeks with courage to risk the later battles in the cause of salvation, learning their lesson from the men of Marathon.  To them, therefore, we award in this our speech the first prize for valor, and the second to those who fought and won the sea-fights off \nand at . And truly concerning these men also one might have much to relate, regarding the manner of onsets they endured both by land and sea, and how they repelled them;  but the achievement I shall mention is that which was, in my judgement, the noblest that they performed, in that it followed up the achievement of the men of Marathon.  For whereas the men of Marathon had only proved to the Greeks thus much,that it was possible to repel\nthe barbarians by land though few against many, yet the prospect in a sea-fight remained still doubtful, and the Persians still retained the reputation of being invincible by sea, in virtue of their numbers and their wealth, their naval skill and strength.  For this, then, the men who fought those sea-fights merit our praise, that they delivered the Greeks from the second of their fears, and put an end to the terrors inspired by multitudes of ships and men.  So it came about, by the action of boththe soldiers who fought at Marathon and the sailors who fought at ,\nthat the rest of the Greeks were trained and accustomed to have no fear of the barbarians, neither by land, as our soldiers taught them, nor yet, as our sailors taught them, by sea.  The exploit at  I put third both in order and in merit of those which secured the salvation of ;  and in this exploit, at last, the Lacedaemonians cooperated with the Athenians.  By the action of all these men the greatest and most formidable danger was warded off, and because of this their valor\nwe pronounce their eulogy now, as our successors will in the time to come.  But, in the period that followed, many cities of the Greeks were still in league with the barbarian, and of the king himself it was reported that he was purposing to renew his attempt against the Greeks.  Wherefore it is right that we should make mention also of those men who put the finishing touch to the work of salvation executed by their predecessors by sweeping away the whole of the barbarian power and driving it clean off the seas.  These were the men who fought\nthe sea-fight at the Eurymedon, the men who served in the expedition against , the men who voyaged to  and to many another quarter,men whom we ought to hold in memory and render them thanks, seeing that they put the king in fear and caused him to give his whole mind to his own safety in place of plotting the destruction of .Now this war was endured to the end by all our citizens who warred against the barbarians\nin defence of all the other Greek-speaking peoples as well as themselves.  But when peace was secured and our city was held in honor, there followed the usual consequence which the successful suffer at the hands of men;  for it was assailed by jealousy first, and after jealousy by envy;  and thereby our city was plunged against its will into war with the Greeks.  Thereupon, when war had broken out, they encountered the Lacedaemonians at  while fighting in defence of\nthe liberties of the Boeotians;  and though the battle itself was indecisive, it was decided by the subsequent result.  For whereas the enemy retired and made off, deserting those whom they had come to assist, our men won a victory after a two days' battle at Oenophyta, and rightfully restored those who were wrongfully exiled.  These were the first of our men who, after the Persian war and now helping Greeks against Greeks in the cause of freedom, proved themselves men of valor and delivered those whom they were aiding; \nand they were the first to be honored by the State and laid to rest in this tomb.  Later on, when there was widespread war, and all the Greeks had marched against us and ravaged our country, most evilly requiting our city, and our men had defeated them by sea and had captured their Lacedaemonian leaders in Sphagia, although they had it in their power to destroy them, yet they spared their lives and gave them back\nand made peace, since they deemed that against their fellow Greeks it was right to wage war only up to the point of victory, and not to wreck the whole Greek community for the sake of a city's private grudge, but to wage war to the death against the barbarians.  It is meet, indeed, that we should praise these men who were warriors in this war and now lie here, inasmuch as they demonstrated that if any contended that in the former war, against the barbarians, others were superior to the Athenians, their contention was false. \nThis they now proved by their triumph in the war when the Greeks were at feud, and by their conquest of those who were the leaders of the rest of , when, alone by themselves, they defeated that city by whose allied aid they had formerly defeated the barbarians.  This peace was followed by a third war, as formidable as it was unexpected, wherein many brave men lost their lives and now lie here.  Many of these reared up numerous trophies of victory in , fighting for the freedom\nof Leontini, to succour which city, and to honor their pledges, they sailed to those regions;  but inasmuch as our city was in a helpless, situation and unable to reinforce them owing to the length of the voyage, fortune was against them and they renounced their design;  yet for their prudence and their valor they have received more praise from their foes of the opposite army than the rest of men am their friends.  Many others of them fought in the sea-fights in the , where in one single day they captured all the enemy's ships,\nbesides winning many other engagements.  But what I have termed the formidable and unexpected character of the war lay in this, that the rest of the Greeks had arrived at such a pitch of jealousy towards this city that they even brought themselves to solicit privately the aid of their deadliest foe, the very king whom they had publicly expelled with our assistance, inviting a barbarian as their ally against Greeks;  and dared to range against our city the united forces of all the Greeks\nand barbarians. And then it was that the strength and valor of our State shone out conspicuously.  For when men fancied that she was already reduced by war, with her ships cut off at , her citizens sent sixty ships to the rescue, manning the ships themselves and proving themselves disputably to be men of valor by conquering their foes and setting free their friends; albeit they met with undeserved misfortune, and were not recovered from the sea to find their burial here. And for these reasons it behoves us to have them in remembrance\nand to praise them always;  for it was owing to their valor that we were conquerors not only in the sea-fight on that day but in all the rest of the war;  and it was due to them that men formed the conviction regarding our city (and it was a true conviction) that she could never be warred down, not even by all the world.  And in truth it was by our own dissensions that we were brought down and not by the hands of other men;  for by them we are still to this day undefeated, and it is we ourselves who have both defeated and been defeated by ourselves.\nAfter these happenings, when we were at peace and amity with other States, our civil war at home was waged in such a way thatif men are fated to engage in civil strifethere is no man but would pray for his own State that its sickness might resemble ours.  So kindly and so friendly was the way in which the citizens from the Peiraeus and from the city consorted with one another, and alsobeyond men's hopeswith the other Greeks;  and such moderation did they show in their settlement\nof the war against the men at . And the cause of all these actions was nothing else than that genuine kinship which produces, not in word only but in deed, a firm friendship founded on community of race.  And of those who fell in this war also it is meet to make mention and to reconcile them by such means as we can under present conditions,by prayer, that is, and by sacrifice,praying for them to those that have them in their keeping, seeing that we ourselves also have been reconciled. \nFor it was not through wickedness that they set upon one another, nor yet through hatred, but through misfortune.  And to this we ourselves, who now live, can testify;  for we who are of the same stock as they grant forgiveness to one another both for what we have done and what we have suffered.  After this, when peace was completely re-established, the city remained quiet, granting forgiveness to the barbarians for the vigorous defence they had offered when she had done them injury, but feeling aggrieved with the Greeks at the thought of the return they had made for the benefits she had done them,\nin that they joined themselves to the barbarians, and stripped her of those ships which had once been the means of their own salvation, and demolished her walls as a recompense for our saving their walls from ruin. Our city, therefore, resolved that never again would she succour Greeks when in danger of enslavement either by one another or at the hands of barbarians;  and in this mind she abode.  Such then being our policy, the Lacedaemonians supposed that we, the champions of liberty, were laid low, and that it was now open to them to enslave the rest, and this\nthey proceeded to do.  But why should I prolong the story?  For what followed next is no tale of ancient history about men of long ago.  Nay, we ourselves know how the Argives, the Boeotians and the Corinthiansthe leading States of Greececame to need our city, being stricken with terror, and how even the Persian king himselfmost marvellous fact of allwas reduced to such a state of distress that eventually he could hope for salvation from no other quarter save this city of ours\nwhich he had been so eager to destroy.  And in truth, if one desired to frame a just accusation against the city, the only true accusation one could bring would be this,that she has always been compassionate to excess and the handmaid of the weak.  And in fact, on that occasion, she proved unable to harden her heart and adhere firmly to her resolved policy of refusing to assist any in danger of enslavement against those who wronged them; \non the contrary she gave way and lent assistance.  The Greeks she aided herself and rescued them from slavery, so that they remained free until such time as they enslaved each other once more;  but to the King she could not bring herself to lend official aid for fear of disgracing the trophies of Marathon,  and , but she permitted exiles only and volunteers to assist him, and thereby, beyond a doubt, she saved him. Having, then, restored her walls\nand rebuilt her navy, she entered upon the war, since war was forced upon her, and in defence of the Persians warred against the Lacedaemonians.  But the King, becoming afraid of our city when he saw that the Lacedaemonians were desisting from the naval struggle, wished to desert us;  so he demanded the surrender of the Greeks in the Continent, whom the Lacedaemonians had formerly given over to him, as the price of his continuing his alliance with us and the other allies,\nthinking that we would refuse and thus furnish him with a pretext for his desertion.  Now in the case of the rest of his allies he was mistaken;  for they all including the Corinthians, Argives, Boeotians, and the restconsented to hand them over to him, making a sworn agreement that if he would supply them with money they would hand over the Greeks in the Continent;  but we, and we alone, could not bring ourselves either to hand them over or to join in the agreement.  So firmly-rooted and so sound is the noble and liberal character of our city, and endowed also\nwith such a hatred of the barbarian, because we are pure-blooded Greeks, unadulterated by barbarian stock.  For there cohabit with us none of the type of Pelops, or Cadmus, or  or Danaus, and numerous others of the kind, who are naturally barbarians though nominally Greeks;  but our people are pure Greeks and not a barbarian blend;  whence it comes that our city is imbued with a whole-hearted hatred of alien races.  None the less, we were isolated once again because of our refusal to perform the dishonorable and unholy act of surrendering Greeks to barbarians. \nAnd thus we found ourselves in the same position which had previously led to our military overthrow;  but, by the help of God, we brought the war to a more favorable conclusion than on that occasion.  For we still retained our ships, our walls, and our own colonies, when we ceased from the war,so welcome to our enemies also was its cessation.  Yet truly in this war also we suffered the loss of valiant men,the men who had difficult ground to cope with at  and treachery at Lechaeum; \nvaliant, too, were the men who rescued the King and drove the Lacedaemonians off the seas.  These men I recall to your memory, and you it becomes to join in praising and celebrating men such as these.And now we have related many of the noble deeds done by the men who are lying here, and by all the others who have died in defence of their city;  yet far more numerous and more noble are those that remain unmentioned; \nfor many days and nights would not suffice were one to relate them all in full.  Wherefore it is right that every man, bearing these men in mind, should exhort these men's children, just as in time of war, not to fall out of rank with their fathers nor to give way to cowardice and beat a retreat.  And I myself for my own part, o ye children of valiant men, am now exhorting you and in the future, wheresoever I shall encounter any of you,\nI shall continue to remind you and admonish you to be zealous to show yourselves supremely valiant.  But on this occasion it is my duty to record the message which your fathers, at the time when they were about to risk their lives, enjoined us, in case any ill befell them, to give to those who survived them.  I will repeat to you both the words which I heard from their lips and those which they would now desire to say to you, if they had the power, judging from what they actually said on that occasion.  You must, however, imagine that you are hearing from their own lips the message which I shall deliver.  This, then, is what they said:\nO  children, that ye are born of valiant sires is clearly shown by the facts now before you:  we, who might have ignobly lived choose rather to die nobly, before we bring you and those after you to disgrace, and before we bring shame upon our own fathers and all our earlier forebears, since we deem that life is unworthy to be lived for the man who brings shame upon his own, and that such an one has no friend amongst gods or man, either here on earth, or under the earth when he is dead.  Wherefore ye must bear in mind our words,\nand whatsoever else ye practice ye must practice it in union with valor, being well assured that when divorced from this all possessions and pursuits are base and ignoble.  For neither does wealth bring honor to its possessor if combined with cowardicefor such an one is rich for another rather than for himself,nor do beauty and strength appear comely, but rather uncomely, when they are attached to one that is cowardly and base, since they make their possessor more conspicuous and show up his cowardice;  and every form of knowledge\nwhen sundered from justice and the rest of virtue is seen to be plain roguery rather than wisdom.  For these reasons do ye make it your endeavor, first and last and always, in every way to show all zeal that ye may exceed, if possible, both us and those who went before us in renown;  but if not, be ye well assured that if we vanquish you in virtue our victory brings us shame, whereas, if we are defeated, our defeat brings happiness.  And most of all would we be the vanquished, you the victors, if ye are careful in your conduct not to trade upon the glory of your ancestors\nnor yet to squander it, believing that for a man who holds himself of some account there is nothing more shameful than to find himself held in honor not for his own sake but because of the glory of his ancestors.  In the honors which belong to their parents, the children truly possess a noble and splendid treasure;  but to use up one's treasure, whether of wealth or of honor, and bequeath none to one's children, is the base and unmanly act of one who lacks all wealth and distinctions of his own.  And if ye practise these precepts\nye will come unto us as friends unto friends whensoever the appointed doom shall convey you hither;  but if ye neglect them and play the coward, ye will be welcomed graciously by none.  Let such, then, be the words we address to our children.Those of us who have fathers or mothers must counsel them always to bear their calamityif so be that such has befallen themas cheerfully as possible, and not join in their lamentations;  for in sooth they will need no further cause of grief; \nthe present misfortune will provide grief in plenty.  Rather should we mollify and assuage their sorrow by reminding them that in the greatest matters the gods have already hearkened unto their prayers.  For they prayed not that their sons should become immortal, but valiant and renowned;  and these, which are the greatest of boons, they obtained.  But that all things should turn out thus according to his mind, in respect of his own life, is for a mortal man no easy matter.  Moreover, by bearing their calamities thus bravely they will clearly show that they are in truth the fathers of brave sons\nand of a like bravery themselves;  whereas if they give way they will afford grounds for suspecting either that they are no fathers of ours or that we have been falsely belauded.  But neither of these should they allow;  rather should they belaud us most by their actions, showing themselves plainly to be in very truth the manly fathers of us men.  That ancient saying, 'Nothing overmuch' is judged to be a noble saying;  and in truth it is well said.  For that man is best prepared for life who makes all that concerns his welfare depend upon himself, or nearly so,\ninstead of hanging his hopes on other men, whereby with their rise or fall his own fortunes also inevitably sway up or down:  he it is that is temperate, he it is that is courageous and wise he it is that, when gaining or losing riches or children, will best exemplify the proverb;  for, because he puts his trust in himself, he will neither be seen rejoicing nor yet grieving overmuch.  Of such a character we request our friends to be,\nand desire them to appear, even as we now display ourselves as such, being neither aggrieved nor alarmed overmuch if so be that at this present crisis we must die.  We beseech both fathers and mothers to pass the rest of their lives holding to this same conviction, and to be well assured that it is not by mourning and lamenting us that they will gratify us most;  nay, if the dead\nhave any perception of the living, it is thus that they would gratify us least, by debasing themselves and bearing their sorrows with a heavy heart;  whereas by a light-hearted and temperate demeanor they would gratify us most.  As for our own fortunes, they have already reached that climax which is the noblest of all for mortal men;  wherefore it is more fitting to magnify than to mourn them.  But to our wives and children let them give care and nurture and devote their mind to them;  for thus they will best forget their ill fortune and live a life that is nobler and truer and\nmore pleasing in our eyes.Let this, then, suffice as our message to our kinsfolk.  To the City we would add an exhortation that on our behalf they care for our parents and our sons, bestowing on the latter an orderly training, and on the former the fitting nurture of old age;  and, as it is, we are well assured that even without our exhortation the city will bestow upon them ample care.Such is the message, o ye children and parents of the fallen,\nwhich they enjoined upon us to deliver, and which I, with all the earnestness in my power, have now delivered;  and I myself, on their behalf, entreat the children to imitate their fathers, and the parents to have no fear for themselves, seeing that we, both privately and publicly, will give nurture to your age and bestow care upon you, wheresoever one of us meets with one of you.  And as regards the care bestowed by the City, of your own selves ye know well that she has made laws regarding both the children and the begetters of those who have fallen in the war, to ensure their care;  and that the highest authority in the State is instructed to watch over them\nbeyond all other citizens, that the fathers and mothers of these men may suffer no wrong.  And the City herself helps in the bringing up of their children, endeavoring to render them as little conscious as possible of their orphaned condition;  while they are yet children she stands towards them as a father, and when they arrive at man's estate she presents them with full military equipment and sends them back to their own place, thereby exhibiting and putting them in mind of their fathers' profession by bestowing on each of them the instruments\nof his father prowess, while at the same time desiring that he should be auspiciously equipped with arms on commencing his journey to his ancestral hearth, there to rule with power.  Nor does the City ever omit to pay honor to the dead heroes themselves, seeing that she herself year by year performs publicly, on behalf of all, those customary rites which are privately performed for each;  and moreover, she institutes contests in athletics and horse-racing and music of every kind.  And thus, in simple fact, she stands towards the fallen in the position of son and heir,\ntowards the sons in that of father, and towards the parents of the dead in that of guardian, thus exercising towards all all manner of care throughout all time.  Laying which to heart it behoves you to bear your sorrow with the greater calm;  for thus will ye best content both the dead and the living, and tend and be tended with the greatest ease.  And now that you and all the rest have already made public lamentation for the dead as the law ordains, go you your ways.There, Menexenus, you have the oration of Aspasia,\nthe Milesian."}}, {"speaker": "Menexenus", "p": "And by Zeus, Socrates, Aspasia, by your account, deserves to be congratulated if she is really capable of composing a speech like that, woman though she is."}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": "Nay, then, if you are incredulous, come along with me and listen to a speech from her own lips."}, {"speaker": "Menexenus", "p": "I have met with Aspasia many a time, Socrates, and I know well what she is like."}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": "Well, then, don't you admire her, and are you not grateful to her now for her oration?"}, {"speaker": "Menexenus", "p": {"milestone": {"@n": "249e", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "Yes, I am exceedingly grateful, Socrates, for the oration\nto her or to himwhoever it was that repeated it to you;  and what is more, I owe many other debts of gratitude to him that repeated it."}}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": "That will be fine!

When I was attending your lectures, Socrates, I was oftentimes amazed at what I heard, and you seemed to me to surpass all other men in the nobleness of your discourse, when you rebuked mankind and chanted these words like a God on the tragic stage: \nWhither haste ye, 0 men?  Yea, verily ye know not that ye are doing none of the things ye ought, seeing that ye spend your whole energy on wealth and the acquiring of it;  while as to your sons to whom ye will bequeath it, ye neglect to ensure that they shall understand how to use it justly, and ye find for them no teachers of justice, if so be that it is teachableor if it be a matter of training and practice, instructors who can efficiently practice and train themnor have ye even begun by reforming yourselves in this respect.  Yet when ye perceive that ye yourselves and your children, though adequately instructed in letters and music and gymnastic\nwhich ye, forsooth, regard as a complete education in virtueare in consequence none the less vicious in respect of wealth, how is it that ye do not contemn this present mode of education nor search for teachers who will put an end to this your lack of culture?  Yet truly it is because of this dissonance and sloth, and not because of failure to keep in step with the lyre that brother with brother and city with city clash together without measure or harmony\nand are at strife, and in their warring perpetrate and suffer the uttermost horrors.  But ye assert that the unjust are unjust not because of their lack of education and lack of knowledge but voluntarily, while on the other hand ye have the face to affirm that injustice is a foul thing, and hateful to Heaven.  Then how, pray, could any man voluntarily choose an evil of such a kind?  Any man, you reply, who is mastered by his pleasures.  But is not this condition also involuntary, if the act of mastering be voluntary?  Thus in every way the argument proves that unjust action is involuntary, and that every man privately\nand all the cities publicly ought to pay more attention than they do now to this matter.So then, Socrates, when I hear you constantly making these speeches I admire you immensely and praise you to the skies.  So too when you state the next point in your argument, that those who train their bodies but neglect their souls are guilty of another action of the same sortneglecting the part that should rule, and attending to that which should be ruled.  Also when you declare that whatsoever object a man knows not how to make use of, it is better for him to refrain from making use thereof;  thus, suppose a man knows not how to use his eyes or his ears or the whole of his body, it is better for such a man not to hear nor to see nor to employ his body for any other use rather than to use it in any way whatsoever. \nSo too, likewise, with respect to art:  it is surely plain that a man who does not know how to use his own lyre does not know either how to use his neighbor's, and that one who does not know how to use the lyre of others does not know how to use his own either,nor yet any other instrument or chattel.  Moreover, the conclusion of this argument of yours is a fine one,how that for every man who knows not how to make use of his soul it is better to have his soul at rest and not to live, than to live acting according to his own caprice;  but if it is necessary for him to live,\nit is better after all for such an one to spend his life as a slave rather than a free man, handing over the rudder of his will, as it were of a ship, to another man who has learnt the art of steering menwhich is the name that you, Socrates, frequently give to politics, when you declare that this very same art is that of judging and justice.Against these arguments and others of a like kind, exceedingly numerous and couched in exceedingly noble language, showing that virtue can be taught and that a man should care above all else for himself, I have hardly uttered a word up till now, nor do I suppose that I ever shall utter a word against them\nin the future, for I regard them as most valuable admonitions and most useful, literally capable of waking us up, as it were, out of our slumber.  So I gave my attention with a view to hear what was to follow next, although I did not at first question you yourself, Socrates, but some of your contemporaries and fellow-students or companionsor whatever name one ought to give to the relation in which they stand towards you.  Of these I questioned first those who are specially held in regard by yourself,\nasking them what was your next argument, and propounding the matter to them somewhat after your own fashion:  I ask you, my very good Sirs, in what sense do we now accept the exhortation to virtue which Socrates has given us.  Are we to regard it as all there is, and suppose it to be impossible to pursue the object further and grasp it fully;  and is this to be our lifelong task, just to exhort those who have not as yet been exhorted, and that they in turn should exhort others?  Or, when we have agreed that this is exactly what a man should do, ought we to ask Socrates, and one another,\nthe further questionWhat is the next step?  What do we say is the way in which we ought to begin the study of justice?  Just as if a man were exhorting us to devote care to our bodies, observing that we like children had as yet no notion of the existence of the arts of gymnastics and medicine;  and were then to reproach us and say that it is disgraceful to spend all one's care on wheat and barley and vines and all the goods which we labor to acquire for the sake of the body, and yet make no effort to discover some art or device for securing that the body itself shall be in the best possible conditionand that in spite of the fact that such an art exists.  Suppose then that we had put to the man who was thus exhorting us this further question\nWhat arts do you say these are?  His answer, no doubt, would beGymnastics and medicine.  So now, in the case before us, what do we say is the art which deals with the virtue of the soul?  Let it be stated.  Then he who was reputed to be their most powerful exponent of these matters answered me and said that this art is precisely that which, said he, you hear Socrates describing,nothing else than justice.  I then repliedDo not explain to me merely its name, but like this:There is an art called medicine;  and of this the effects are two-fold, the one being\nto produce constantly new doctors in addition to those already existing, and the other to produce health.  And of these the latter result is no longer in itself an art but an effect of that art which both teaches and is taught, which effect we term health.  So likewise the operations of the joiner's art are a house and joinery, of which the one is an effect, the other a doctrine.  In like manner let it be granted that the one effect of justice is to produce just men, as of the other arts their several artists;  but as to the other, the operation which the just man is capable of performing for us, what do we say that is?  Tell us. \nThe reply of your exponent was, I think, The beneficial;  while another said The right;  a third The useful;  and yet another The profitable.  So I resumed my inquiry and said:  In the former case also we find these names in each one of the artsdoing the right, the profitable, the useful, and the rest of such terms;  but as regards the object at which all these operations aim, each art will declare that which is peculiar to itself;  for example, the art of joinery will assert that the result of good, beautiful, and right action is the production of wooden vessels, which in themselves are not an art.  So let the operation of justice\nbe stated in the same way.  Finally, Socrates, one of your companions, who was reputed to be a most accomplished speaker, made answer that the peculiar effect of justice, which was effected by no other art, was to produce friendship in States. And he, in turn, when questioned declared that friendship is a good thing and never an evil;  while as to the friendships of children and those of wild beasts, which we call by this name, he refused to admitwhen questioned upon the pointthat they were friendships;  since, as a result of the argument, he was forced to say that such relations were for the most part harmful\nrather than good.  So to avoid such an admission he denied that such relations were friendships at all, and said that those who give them this name name them falsely;  and real and true friendship, he said, is most exactly described as unanimity.  And when asked about unanimity, whether he declared it to be unity of opinion or knowledge, he rejected the expression unity of opinion, for of necessity many cases of unity of opinion occurred amongst men that were harmful, whereas he had agreed that friendship was wholly a good thing and an effect of justice;  consequently he affirmed that unanimity was the same, and was not opinion, but knowledge.Now when we were at this point in the argument and at our wits' end,\nthe bystanders were ready to fall upon the man and to cry that the argument had circled round to the same point as at first;  and they declared that:  Medicine also is a kind of unanimity, as are all the arts, and they are able to explain what it is they deal with;  but as for the justice or unanimity which you talk of, it has no comprehension of what its own aim is, and what the effect of it is remains quite obscure.Finally, Socrates, I put these questions to you yourself also, and you told me that it belonged to justice\nto injure one's enemies and to do well to one's friends.  But later on it appeared that the just man never injures anyone, for in all his acts he aims at benefiting all.  So after repeated questioningsnot once only or twice but spending quite a long time at itI gave it up, concluding that though you were better than any man at the task of exhorting men to devote themselves to virtue, yet of these two alternatives one must be true:  either you are capable of effecting thus much only and nothing more,a thing which might happen also in respect of any other art whatsoever, as for example a man who was no steersman might practice composing an eulogy of that art\nas one of high value to mankind, and so too with all the other arts;  so against you too one might perhaps bring the same charge in regard to justice, that you are none the more an expert about justice because you eulogize it finely.  Not that this is the complaint I make myself;  but it must be one or other of these two alternatives,either you do not possess the knowledge or else you refuse to let me share it.  Consequently, methinks I will betake myself, in my perplexity, to Thrasymachus and to everyone else I can.  However, if you are really willing\nto refrain at last from addressing to me these hortatory discourses, and just as you would have followed up the hortatory discourse, suppose you had been exhorting me in respect of gymnastics that I should not neglect my body, by explaining the nature of the body and the nature of the treatment it requiresso let the same course be followed in the present case.  Assume that Cleitophon agrees that it is ridiculous to expend care on everything else and to neglect the soul, for the sake of which all the other labour is incurred; \nand suppose also that I have made all the other subsequent statements which I rehearsed just now.  And I entreat you, as I speak, by no means to act otherwise, lest I should do, as I do now, praise you in part to Lysias and to the others, and also in part blame you.  For I shall maintain, Socrates, that while you are of untold value to a man who has not been exhorted, to him who has been exhorted you are almost an actual hindrance in the way of his attaining the goal of virtue and becoming a happy man."}}]}}, {"@n": "Tim.", "body": {"head": "Timaeus", "castList": {"castItem": [{"@type": "role", "role": "Socrates"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Timaeus"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Hermocrates"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Critias"}]}, "milestone": [{"@unit": "page", "@n": "17"}, {"@n": "17a", "@unit": "section"}], "sp": [{"speaker": "Socrates", "p": {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "Loeb", "#text": "This fourth guest cannot be identified.

Gladly would I listen to anyone who should depict in words our State contending against others in those struggles which States wage;  in how proper a spirit it enters upon war, and how in its warring it exhibits qualities such as befit its education and training in its dealings with each several State whether in respect of military actions or in respect of verbal negotiations.  And herein, Critias and Hermocrates,\nI am conscious of my own inability ever to magnify sufficiently our citizens and our State.  Now in this inability of mine there is nothing surprising;  but I have formed the same opinion about the poets also, those of the present as well as those of the past;  not that I disparage in any way the poetic clan, but it is plain to all that the imitative tribe will imitate with most ease and success the things amidst which it has been reared, whereas it is hard for any man to imitate well in action what lies outside the range of his rearing,\nand still harder in speech.  Again, as to the class of Sophists, although I esteem them highly versed in many fine discourses of other kinds, yet I fear lest haply, seeing they are a class which roams from city to city and has no settled habitations of its own, they may go wide of the mark in regard to men who are at once philosophers and statesmen, and what they would be likely to do and say, in their several dealings with foemen in war and battle, both by word and deed.  Thus there remains only that class which is of your complexion\na class which, alike by nature and nurture, shares the qualities of both the others.  For our friend  is a native of a most well-governed State, Italian Locris, and inferior to none of its citizens either in property or in rank;  and not only has he occupied the highest offices and posts of honor in his State, but he has also attained, in my opinion, the very summit of eminence in all branches of philosophy.  As to Critias, all of us here know that he is no novice in any of the subjects we are discussing.  As regards Hermocrates, we must believe the many witnesses who assert that both by nature and by nurture\nhe is competent for all these inquiries.  So, with this in my mind, when you requested me yesterday to expound my views of the polity I gratified you most willingly, since I knew that none could deal more adequately than you (if you were willing) with the next subject of discourse;  for you alone, of men now living, could show our State engaged in a suitable war and exhibiting all the qualities which belong to it.  Accordingly, when I had spoken upon my prescribed theme, I in turn prescribed for you this theme which I am now explaining.  And you, after consulting together among yourselves,\nagreed to pay me back today with a feast of words;  so here I am, ready for that feast in festal garb, and eager above all men to begin."}}, {"speaker": "Hermocrates", "p": {"milestone": {"@n": "20d", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "Of a truth, Socrates, as our friend has said, we will show no lack of zeal, nor have we any excuse for refusing to do as you say.

For indeed at that time, as he said himself,\nCritias was already close upon ninety years of age, while I was somewhere about ten;  and it chanced to be that day of the Apaturia which is called Cureotis. The ceremony for boys which was always customary at the feast was held also on that occasion, our fathers arranging contests in recitation.  So while many poems of many poets were declaimed, since the poems of Solon were at that time new, many of us children chanted them.  And one of our fellow tribesmenwhether he really thought so at the time or whether he was paying a compliment\nto Critiasdeclared that in his opinion Solon was not only the wisest of men in all else, but in poetry also he was of all poets the noblest.  Whereat the old man (I remember the scene well) was highly pleased and said with a smile, If only, Amynander, he had not taken up poetry as a by-play but had worked hard at it like others, and if he had completed the story he brought here from , instead of being forced to lay it aside owing to the seditions and all the other evils he found here on his return,\nwhy then, I say, neither Hesiod nor Homer nor any other poet would ever have proved more famous than  he.  And what was the story, Critias? said the other.  Its subject, replied Critias, was a very great exploit, worthy indeed to be accounted the most notable of all exploits, which was performed by this city, although the record of it has not endured until now owing to lapse of time and the destruction of those who wrought it.  Tell us from the beginning, said Amynander, what Solon related and how, and who were the informants who vouched for its truth.\nIn the Delta of , said Critias, where, at its head, the stream of the  parts in two, there is a certain district called the Saitic.  The chief city in this district is Saisthe home of King Amasis,the founder of which, they say, is a goddess whose Egyptian name is Neith, and in Greek, as they assert, Athena.  These people profess to be great lovers of  and in a measure akin to our people here.  And Solon said that when he travelled there he was held in great esteem amongst them;  moreover, when he was questioning such of their priests\nas were most versed in ancient lore about their early history, he discovered that neither he himself nor any other Greek knew anything at all, one might say, about such matters.  And on one occasion, when he wished to draw them on to discourse on ancient history, he attempted to tell them the most ancient of our traditions, concerning Phoroneus, who was said to be the first man, and Niobe;  and he went on to tell the legend about Deucalion and  after the Flood, and how they survived it, and to give the geneology of their descendants;\nand by recounting the number of years occupied by the events mentioned he tried to calculate the periods of time.  Whereupon one of the priests, a prodigiously old man, said, O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always children:  there is not such a thing as an old Greek. And on hearing this he asked, What mean you by this saying?  And the priest replied, You are young in soul, every one of you. For therein you possess not a single belief that is ancient and derived from old tradition, nor yet one science that is hoary with age.\nAnd this is the cause thereof:  There have been and there will be many and divers destructions of mankind, of which the greatest are by fire and water, and lesser ones by countless other means.  For in truth the story that is told in your country as well as ours, how once upon a time Phaethon, son of Helios, yoked his father's chariot, and, because he was unable to drive it along the course taken by his father, burnt up all that was upon the earth and himself perished by a thunderbolt,that story, as it is told, has the fashion of a legend, but the truth of it lies in\nthe occurrence of a shifting of the bodies in the heavens which move round the earth, and a destruction of the things on the earth by fierce fire, which recurs at long intervals.  At such times all they that dwell on the mountains and in high and dry places suffer destruction more than those who dwell near to rivers or the sea;  and in our case the , our Saviour in other ways, saves us also at such times from this calamity by rising high.  And when, on the other hand, the Gods purge the earth with a flood of waters, all the herdsmen and shepherds that are in the mountains are saved,\nbut those in the cities of your land are swept into the sea by the streams;  whereas In our country neither then nor at any other time does the water pour down over our fields from above, on the contrary it all tends naturally to well up from below.  Hence it is, for these reasons, that what is here preserved is reckoned to be most ancient;  the truth being that in every place where there is no excessive heat or cold to prevent it there always exists some human stock, now more, now less in number.\nAnd if any event has occurred that is noble or great or in any way conspicuous, whether it be in your country or in ours or in some other place of which we know by report, all such events are recorded from of old and preserved here in our temples;  whereas your people and the others are but newly equipped, every time, with letters and all such arts as civilized States require  and when, after the usual interval of years, like a plague, the flood from heaven comes sweeping down afresh upon your people,\nit leaves none of you but the unlettered and uncultured, so that you become young as ever, with no knowledge of all that happened in old times in this land or in your own.  Certainly the genealogies which you related just now, Solon, concerning the people of your country, are little better than children's tales;  for, in the first place, you remember but one deluge, though many had occurred previously;  and next, you are ignorant of the fact that the noblest and most perfect race amongst men were born in the land where you now dwell, and from them both you yourself are sprung and the whole\nof your existing city, out of some little seed that chanced to be left over;  but this has escaped your notice because for many generations the survivors died with no power to express themselves in writing.  For verily at one time, Solon, before the greatest destruction by water, what is now the Athenian State was the bravest in war and supremely well organized also in all other respects.  It is said that it possessed the most splendid works of art and the noblest polity of any nation under heaven of which we have heard tell.\nUpon hearing this, Solon said that he marvelled, and with the utmost eagerness requested the priest to recount for him in order and exactly all the facts about those citizens of old.  The priest then said:  I begrudge you not the story, Solon;  nay, I will tell it, both for your own sake and that of your city, and most of all for the sake of the Goddess who has adopted for her own both your land and this of ours, and has nurtured and trained them,yours first by the space of a thousand years, when she had received  the seed of you from Ge\nand Hephaestus, and after that ours.  And the duration of our civilization as set down in our sacred writings is 8000 years.  Of the citizens, then, who lived 9000 years ago, I will declare to you briefly certain of their laws and the noblest of the deeds they performed:\nthe full account in precise order and detail we shall go through later at our leisure, taking the actual writings.  To get a view of their laws, look at the laws here;  for you will find existing here at the present time many examples of the laws which then existed in your city.  You see, first, how the priestly class is separated off from the rest;  next, the class of craftsmen, of which each sort works by itself without mixing with any other;  then the classes of shepherds, hunters, and farmers, each distinct and separate.  Moreover, the military class here,\nas no doubt you have noticed, is kept apart from all the other classes, being enjoined by the law to devote itself solely to the work of training for war.  A further feature is the character of their equipment with shields and  spears;  for we were the first of the peoples of  to adopt these weapons, it being the Goddess who instructed us, even as she instructed you first of all the dwellers in yonder lands.  Again, with regard to wisdom, you perceive, no doubt, the law herehow much attention\nit has devoted from the very beginning to the Cosmic Order, by discovering all the effects which the divine causes produce upon human life, down to divination and the art of medicine which aims at health, and by its mastery also of all the other subsidiary studies.  So when, at that time, the Goddess had furnished you, before all others, with all this orderly and regular system, she established your State, choosing the spot wherein you were born since she perceived therein a climate duly blended, and how that it would bring forth men of supreme wisdom.\nSo it was that the Goddess, being herself both a lover of war and a lover of wisdom, chose the spot which was likely to bring forth men most like unto herself, and this first she established.  Wherefore you lived under the rule of such laws as these,yea, and laws still better,and you surpassed all men in every virtue, as became those who were the offspring and nurslings of gods.  Many, in truth, and great are the achievements of your State, which are a marvel to men as they are here recorded;  but there is one which stands out above all\nboth for magnitude and for nobleness.  For it is related in our records how once upon a time your State stayed the course of a mighty host, which, starting from a distant point in the Atlantic ocean, was insolently advancing to attack the whole of , and  to boot.  For the ocean there was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an island which was larger than  and  together;  and it was possible for the travellers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from the islands to the whole of the continent\nover against them which encompasses that veritable ocean.  For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance;  but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent.  Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvellous power, which held sway over all the island,  and over many other islands also and parts of the continent;  and, moreover,\nof the lands here within the Straits they ruled over  as far as , and over  as far as .  So this host, being all gathered together, made an attempt one time to enslave by one single onslaught both your country and ours and the whole of the territory within the Straits.  And then it was, Solon, that the manhood of your State showed itself conspicuous for valor and might in the sight of all the world.  For it stood pre-eminent above all\nin gallantry and all warlike arts, and acting partly as leader of the Greeks, and partly standing alone by itself when deserted  by  all others, after encountering the deadliest perils, it defeated the invaders and reared a trophy;  whereby it saved from slavery such as were not as yet enslaved, and all the rest of us who dwell within the bounds of Heracles it ungrudgingly set free.  But at a later time there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods,\nand one grievous day and night befell them, when the whole body of your warriors was swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner was swallowed up by the sea and vanished;  wherefore also the ocean at that spot has now become impassable and unsearchable, being blocked up by the shoal mud which the island created as it settled down.You have now heard, Socrates, in brief outline, the account given by the elder Critias of what he heard from Solon;\nand when you were speaking yesterday about the State and the citizens you were describing, I marvelled as I called to mind the facts I am now relating, reflecting what a strange piece of fortune it was that your description coincided so exactly for the most part with Solon's account.  I was loth, however,\nto speak on the instant;  for owing to lapse of time my recollection of his account was not sufficiently clear.  So I decided that I ought not to relate it until I had first gone over it all carefully in my own mind.  Consequently, I readily consented to the theme you proposed yesterday, since I thought that we should be reasonably well provided for the task of furnishing a satisfactory discoursewhich in all such cases is the greatest task.  So it was that, as Hermocrates has said, the moment I left your place yesterday I began to relate to them the story as I recollected it,\nand after I parted from them I pondered it over during the night and recovered, as I may say, the whole story.  Marvellous, indeed, is the way in which the lessons of one's childhood grip the mind, as the saying is.  For myself, I know not whether I could recall to mind all that I heard yesterday;  but as to the account I heard such a great time ago, I should be immensely surprised if a single detail of it has escaped me.  I had then the greatest pleasure and amusement in hearing it,\nand the old man was eager to tell me, since I kept questioning him repeatedly, so that the story is stamped firmly on my mind like the encaustic designs of an indelible painting.  Moreover, immediately after daybreak I related this same story to our friends here, so that they might share in my rich provision of discourse.Now, therefore,and this is the purpose of all that I have been saying,I am ready to tell my tale, not in summary outline only but in full detail just as I heard it.  And the city with its citizens which you described to us yesterday, as it were in a fable,\nwe will now transport hither into the realm of fact;  for we will assume that the city is that ancient city of ours, and declare that the citizens you conceived are in truth those actual progenitors of ours, of whom the priest told.  In all ways they will correspond, nor shall we be out of tune if we affirm that those citizens of yours are the very men who lived in that age.  Thus, with united effort, each taking his part, we will endeavor to the best of our powers to do justice to the theme you have prescribed.  Wherefore, Socrates, we must consider whether this story is to our mind, or\nwe have still to look for some other to take its place."}}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "page", "@n": "27"}, {"@n": "27a", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "What story should we adopt, Critias, in preference to this?

Grant, then, that we have thus duly invoked the deities;\nourselves we must also invoke so to proceed, that you may most easily learn and I may most clearly expound my views regarding the subject before us.Now first of all we must, in my judgement, make the following distinction.  What is that which is Existent always\nand has no Becoming?  And what is that which is Becoming always and never is Existent?  Now the one of these is apprehensible by thought with the aid of reasoning, since it is ever uniformly existent;  whereas the other is an object of opinion with the aid of unreasoning sensation, since it becomes and perishes and is never really existent.  Again, everything which becomes must of necessity become owing to some Cause; for without a cause it is impossible for anything to attain becoming.  But when the artificer of any object, in forming its shape and quality, keeps his gaze fixed on that which is uniform, using a model of this kind, that object, executed in this way, must of necessity\nbe beautiful;  but whenever he gazes at that which has come into existence and uses a created model, the object thus executed is not beautiful.  Now the whole Heaven, or Cosmos, or if there is any other name which it specially prefers, by that let us call it,so, be its name what it may, we must first investigate concerning it that primary question which has to be investigated at the outset in every case,namely, whether it has existed always, having no beginning of generation, or whether it has come into existence, having begun from some beginning.  It has come into existence;  for it is visible and tangible and possessed of a body;  and all such things are sensible,\nand things sensible, being apprehensible by opinion with the aid of sensation, come into existence, as we saw, and are generated.  And that which has come into existence must necessarily, as we say, have come into existence by reason of some Cause.  Now to discover the Maker and Father of this Universe were a task indeed;  and having discovered Him, to declare Him unto all men were a thing impossible.  However, let us return and inquire further concerning the Cosmos,after which of the Models did its Architect construct it?\nWas it after that which is self-identical and uniform, or after that which has come into existence;  Now if so be that this Cosmos is beautiful and its Constructor good, it is plain that he fixed his gaze on the Eternal;  but if otherwise (which is an impious supposition), his gaze was on that which has come into existence.  But it is clear to everyone that his gaze was on the Eternal;  for the Cosmos is the fairest of all that has come into existence, and He the best of all the Causes.  So having in this wise come into existence, it has been constructed after the pattern of that which is apprehensible by reason and thought and is self-identical.\nAgain, if these premisses be granted, it is wholly necessary that this Cosmos should be a Copy of something.  Now in regard to every matter it is most important to begin at the natural beginning.  Accordingly, in dealing with a copy and its model, we must affirm that the accounts given will themselves be akin to the diverse objects which they serve to explain;  those which deal with what is abiding and firm and discernible by the aid of thought will be abiding and unshakable;  and in so far as it is possible and fitting for statements to be irrefutable and invincible,\nthey must in no wise fall short thereof;  whereas the accounts of that which is copied after the likeness of that Model, and is itself a likeness, will be analogous thereto and possess likelihood;  for I as Being is to Becoming, so is Truth to Belief.  Wherefore, Socrates, if in our treatment of a great host of matters regarding the Gods and the generation of the Universe we prove unable to give accounts that are always in all respects self-consistent and perfectly exact, be not thou surprised;  rather we should be content if we can furnish accounts that are inferior to none in likelihood, remembering that both I who speak\nand you who judge are but human creatures, so that it becomes us to accept the likely account of these matters and forbear to search beyond it."}}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": "Excellent, Timaeus!

He was good, and in him that is good no envy ariseth ever concerning anything;  and being devoid of envy He desired that all should be, so far as possible, like unto Himself.  This principle, then, we shall be wholly right in accepting from men of wisdom as being above all the supreme originating principle of Becoming and the Cosmos.\nFor God desired that, so far as possible, all things should be good and nothing evil;  wherefore, when He took over all that was visible, seeing that it was not in a state of rest but in a state of discordant and disorderly motion, He brought it into order out of disorder, deeming that the former state is in all ways better than the latter.  For Him who is most good it neither was nor is permissible to perform any action save what is most fair.  As He reflected, therefore, He perceived that of such creatures as are by nature visible,\nnone that is irrational will be fairer, comparing wholes with wholes, than the rational;  and further, that reason cannot possibly belong to any apart from Soul.  So because of this reflection He constructed reason within soul and soul within body as He fashioned the All, that so the work He was executing might be of its nature most fair and most good.  Thus, then, in accordance with the likely account, we must declare that this Cosmos has verily come into existence as a Living Creature endowed with soul and reason owing to the providence of God.\nThis being established, we must declare that which comes next in order.  In the semblance of which of the living Creatures did the Constructor of the cosmos construct it?  We shall not deign to accept any of those which belong by nature to the category of parts;  for nothing that resembles the imperfect would ever become fair.  But we shall affirm that the Cosmos, more than aught else, resembles most closely that Living Creature of which all other living creatures, severally and generically, are portions.  For that Living Creature embraces and contains within itself all the intelligible Living Creatures, just as this Universe contains us and all the other visible living creatures\nthat have been fashioned.  For since God desired to make it resemble most closely that intelligible Creature which is fairest of all and in all ways most perfect, He constructed it as a Living Creature, one and visible, containing within itself all the living creatures which are by nature akin to itself.\nAre we right, then, in describing the Heaven as one, or would it be more correct to speak of heavens as many or infinite in number?  One it must be termed, if it is to be framed after its Pattern.  For that which embraces all intelligible Living Creatures could never be second, with another beside it;  for if so, there must needs exist yet another Living Creature, which should embrace them both, and of which they two would each be a part; in which case this Universe could no longer be rightly described as modelled on these two, but rather on that third Creature which contains them both.\nWherefore, in order that this Creature might resemble the all perfect Living Creature in respect of its uniqueness, for this reason its Maker made neither two Universes nor an infinite number, but there is and will continue to be this one generated Heaven, unique of its kind.Now that which has come into existence must needs be of bodily form, visible and tangible;  yet without fire nothing could ever become visible, nor tangible without some solidity, nor solid without earth.  Hence, in beginning to construct the body of the All, God was making it of fire and earth.  But it is not possible that two things alone should be conjoined without a third;\nfor there must needs be some intermediary bond to connect the two.  And the fairest of bonds is that which most perfectly unites into one both itself and the things which it binds together;  and to effect this in the fairest manner is the natural property of proportion.  For whenever the middle term of any three numbers, cubic or square,\nis such that as the first term is to it, so is it to the last term, and again, conversely, as the last term is to the middle, so is the middle to the first,then the middle term becomes in turn the first and the last, while the first and last become in turn middle terms, and the necessary consequence will be that all the terms are interchangeable, and being interchangeable they all form a unity.  Now if the body of the All\nhad had to come into existence as a plane surface, having no depth, one middle term would have sufficed to bind together both itself and its fellow-terms;  but now it is otherwise:  for it behoved it to be solid of shape, and what brings solids into unison is never one middle term alone but always two. Thus it was that in the midst between fire and earth God set water and air, and having bestowed upon them so far as possible a like ratio one towards anotherair being to water as fire to air, and water being to earth as air to water, he joined together and constructed a Heaven visible and tangible.  For these reasons\nand out of these materials, such in kind and four in number, the body of the Cosmos was harmonized by proportion and brought into existence.  These conditions secured for it Amity, so that being united in identity with itself it became indissoluble by any agent other than Him who had bound it together.Now of the four elements the construction of the Cosmos had taken up the whole of every one.  For its Constructor had constructed it of all the fire and water and air and earth that existed, leaving over, outside it, no single particle or potency of any one of these elements.  And these were his intentions:\nfirst, that it might be, so far as possible, a Living Creature, perfect and whole, with all its parts perfect;  and next, that it might be One,\ninasmuch as there was nothing left over out of which another like Creature might come into existence;  and further, that it might be secure from age and ailment, since He perceived that when heat and cold, and all things which have violent potencies, surround a composite body from without and collide with it they dissolve it unduly and make it to waste away by bringing upon it ailments and age.  Wherefore, because of this reasoning, He fashioned it to be One single Whole, compounded of all wholes, perfect and ageless and unailing.\nAnd he bestowed on it the shape which was befitting and akin.  Now for that Living Creature which is designed to embrace within itself all living creatures the fitting shape will be that which comprises within itself all the shapes there are;  wherefore He wrought it into a round, in the shape of a sphere, equidistant in all directions from the center to the extremities, which of all shapes is the most perfect and the most self-similar, since He deemed that the similar is infinitely fairer than the dissimilar.  And on the outside round about, it was all made smooth with great exactness, and that for many reasons.\nFor of eyes it had no need, since outside of it there was nothing visible left over;  nor yet of hearing, since neither was there anything audible;  nor was there any air surrounding it which called for respiration;  nor, again, did it need any organ whereby it might receive the food that entered and evacuate what remained undigested.  For nothing went out from it or came into it from any side, since nothing existed;  for it was so designed as to supply its own wastage as food for itself,\nand to experience by its own agency and within itself all actions and passions, since He that had constructed it deemed that it would be better if it were self-sufficing rather than in need of other things.  Hands, too, He thought He ought not to attach unto it uselessly, seeing they were not required either for grasping or for repelling anyone;  nor yet feet, nor any instruments of locomotion whatsoever.\nFor movement He assigned unto it that which is proper to its body, namely, that one of the seven motions which specially belongs to reason and intelligence;  wherefore He spun it round uniformly in the same spot and within itself and made it move revolving in a circle;  and all the other six motions He took away and fashioned it free from their aberrations.  And seeing that for this revolving motion it had no need of feet, He begat it legless and footless.Such, then, was the sum of the reasoning of the ever-existing God concerning the god\nwhich was one day to be existent, whereby He made it smooth and even and equal on all sides from the center, a whole and perfect body compounded of perfect bodies, And in the midst thereof He set Soul, which He stretched throughout the whole of it, and therewith He enveloped also the exterior of its body;  and as a Circle revolving in a circle He established one sole and solitary Heaven, able of itself because of its excellence to company with itself and needing none other beside, sufficing unto itself as acquaintance and friend.  And because of all this He generated it to be a blessed God.Now as regards the Soul, although we are essaying to describe it after the body,\nGod did not likewise plan it to be younger than the body; for, when uniting them, He would not have permitted the elder to be ruled by the younger;  but as for us men, even as we ourselves partake largely of the accidental and casual, so also do our words.  God, however, constructed Soul to be older than Body and prior in birth and excellence, since she was to be the mistress and ruler and it the ruled;  and, He made her of the materials\nand in the fashion which I shall now describe.Midway between the Being which is indivisible and remains always the same and the Being which is transient and divisible in bodies, He blended a third form of Being compounded out of the twain, that is to say, out of the Same and the Other;  and in like manner He compounded it midway between that one of them which is indivisible and that one which is divisible in bodies.  And He took the three of them, and blent them all together into one form, by forcing the Other into union with the Same, in spite of its being naturally difficult to mix.\nAnd when with the aid of Being He had mixed them, and had made of them one out of three, straightway He began to distribute the whole thereof into so many portions as was meet;  and each portion was a mixture of the Same, of the Other, and of Being. And He began making the division thus: First He took one portion from the whole; then He took a portion double of this; then a third portion, half as  much again as the second portion, that is, three times as much as the first; he fourth portion He took was twice as much as the second; the fifth three times as much as the third;\nthe sixth eight times as much as the first; and the seventh twenty-seven times as much as the first.\nAfter that He went on to fill up the intervals in the series of the powers of 2 and the intervals in the series of powers of 3 in the following manner:  He cut off yet further portions from the original mixture, and set them in between the portions above rehearsed, so as to place two Means in each interval, one a Mean which exceeded its Extremes and was by them exceeded by the same proportional part or fraction of each of the Extremes respectively;  the other a Mean which exceeded one Extreme by the same number or integer as it was exceeded by its other Extreme. And whereas the insertion of these links formed fresh intervals in the former intervals, that is to say, intervals of 3:2 and 4:3 and 9:8, He went on to fill up the 4:3 intervals with 9:8 intervals.\nThis still left over in each case a fraction, which is represented by the terms of the numerical ratio 256:243. And thus the mixture, from which He had been cutting these portions off, was now all spent.Next, He split all this that He had put together into two parts lengthwise;  and then He laid the twain one against the other, the middle of one to the middle of the other, like a great cross;\nand bent either of them into a circle, and join them, each to itself and also to the other, at a point opposite to where they had first been laid together. And He compassed them about with the motion that revolves in the same spot continually, and He made the one circle outer and the other inner.  And the outer motion He ordained to be the Motion of the Same, and the inner motion the Motion of the Other.  And He made the Motion of the Same to be toward the right along the side, and the Motion of the Other to be toward the left along the diagonal;  and He gave the sovranty\nto the Revolution of the Same and of the Uniform.  For this alone He suffered to remain uncloven, whereas He split the inner Revolution in six places into seven unequal circles, according to each of the intervals of the double and triple intervals, three double and three triple.  These two circles then He appointed to go in contrary directions;  and of the seven circles into which He split the inner circle, He appointed three to revolve at an equal speed, the other four to go at speeds equal neither with each other nor with the speed of the aforesaid three, yet moving at speeds the ratios of which one to another are those of natural integers.And when the construction of the Soul had all been completed to the satisfaction of its Constructor, then He fabricated within it all the Corporeal,\nand uniting them center to center He made them fit together.  And the Soul, being woven throughout the Heaven every way from the center to the extremity, and enveloping it in a circle from without, and herself revolving within herself, began a divine beginning of unceasing and intelligent life lasting throughout all time.  And whereas the body of the Heaven is visible, the Soul is herself invisible but partakes in reasoning and in harmony,\nhaving come into existence by the agency of the best of things intelligible and ever-existing as the best of things generated.  Inasmuch, then, as she is a compound, blended of the natures of the Same and the Other and Being, these three portions, and is proportionately divided and bound together, and revolves back upon herself, whenever she touches anything which has its substance dispersed or anything which has its substance undivided she is moved throughout her whole being and announces what the object is identical with\nand from what it is different, and in what relation, where and how and when, it comes about that each thing exists and is acted upon by others both in the sphere of the Becoming and in that of the ever-uniform.  And her announcement, being identically true concerning both the Other and the Same, is borne through the self-moved without speech or sound;  and whenever it is concerned with the sensible, and the circle of the Other moving in straight course proclaims it to the whole of its Soul, opinions and beliefs arise which are firm and true;  and again, when it is concerned with the rational,\nand the circle of the Same, spinning truly, declares the facts, reason and knowledge of necessity result.  But should anyone assert that the substance in which these two states arise is something other than Soul, his assertion will be anything rather than the truth.And when the Father that engendered it perceived it in motion and alive, a thing of joy to the eternal gods, He too rejoiced; and being well-pleased He designed to make it resemble its Model\nstill more closely.  Accordingly, seeing that that Model is an eternal Living Creature, He set about making this Universe, so far as He could, of a like kind.  But inasmuch as the nature of the Living Creature was eternal, this quality it was impossible to attach in its entirety to what is generated;  wherefore He planned to make a movable image of Eternity, and, as He set in order the Heaven, of that Eternity which abides in unity He made an eternal image, moving according to number, even that which we have named Time.\nFor simultaneously with the construction of the Heaven He contrived the production of days and nights and months and years, which existed not before the Heaven came into being.  And these are all portions of Time; even as Was and Shall be are generated forms of Time, although we apply them wrongly, without noticing, to Eternal Being.  For we say that it is or was or will be, whereas, in truth of speech, is alone\nis the appropriate term; was and will be, on the other hand, are terms properly applicable to the Becoming which proceeds in Time, since both of these are motions;  but it belongs not to that which is ever changeless in its uniformity to become either older or younger through time, nor ever to have become so, nor to be so now, nor to be about to be so hereafter, nor in general to be subject to any of the conditions which Becoming has attached to the things which move in the world of Sense, these being generated forms of Time, which imitates Eternity and circles round according to number.  And besides these we make use of the following expressions,\nthat what is become is become, and what is becoming is becoming, and what is about to become is about to become, and what is non-existent is< non-existent;  but none of these expressions is accurate. But the present is not, perhaps, a fitting occasion for an exact discussion of these matters.Time, then, came into existence along with the Heaven, to the end that having been generated together they might also be dissolved together, if ever a dissolution of them should take place;  and it was made after the pattern of the Eternal Nature, to the end that it might be as like thereto as possible; for whereas the pattern is existent through all eternity,\nthe copy, on the other hand, is through all time, continually having existed, existing, and being about to exist.  Wherefore, as a consequence of this reasoning and design on the part of God, with a view to the generation of Time, the sun and moon and five other stars, which bear the appellation of planets, came into existence for the determining and preserving of the numbers of Time.  And when God had made the bodies of each of them He placed them in the orbits along which the revolution of the Other was moving, seven orbits for the seven bodies..\nThe Moon He placed in the first circle around the Earth, the Sun in the second above the Earth; and the  and the Star called Sacred to Hermes He placed in those circles which move in an orbit equal to the Sun in velocity, but endowed with a power contrary thereto;  whence it is that the Sun and the Star of Hermes and the  regularly overtake and are overtaken by one another.  As to the rest of the stars, were one to describe in detail the positions in which He set them, and all the reasons therefor,\nthe description, though but subsidiary, would prove a heavier task than the main argument which it subserves.  Later on, perhaps, at our leisure these points may receive the attention they merit.  So when each of the bodies whose co-operation was required for the making of Time had arrived in its proper orbit;  and when they had been generated as living creatures, having their bodies bound with living bonds,\nand had learnt their appointed duties; then they kept revolving around the circuit of the Other, which is transverse and passes through the circuit of the Same and is dominated thereby;  and part of them moved in a greater, part in a smaller circle, those in the smaller moving more quickly and those in the greater more slowly.  And because of the motion of the Same, the stars which revolved most quickly appeared to be overtaken by those which moved most slowly, although in truth they overtook them;\nfor, because of their simultaneous progress in two opposite directions, the motion of the Same, which is the swiftest of all motions, twisted all their circles into spirals and thus caused the body which moves away from it most slowly to appear the nearest. And in order that there might be a clear measure of the relative speeds, slow and quick, with which they travelled round their eight orbits, in that circle which is second from the earth God kindled a light which now we call the Sun, to the end that it might shine, so far as possible, throughout the whole Heaven, and that all the living creatures entitled thereto might participate in number, learning it from the revolution of the Same and Similar.\nIn this wise and for these reasons were generated Night and Day, which are the revolution of the one and most intelligent circuit;  and Month, every time that the  having completed her own orbit overtakes the Sun;  and Year, as often as the Sun has completed his own orbit.  Of the other stars the revolutions have not been discovered by men (save for a few out of the many);  wherefore they have no names for them, nor do they compute and compare their relative measurements, so that they are not aware, as a rule,\nthat the wanderings of these bodies, which are hard to calculate and of wondrous complexity, constitute Time.  Nevertheless, it is still quite possible to perceive that the complete number of Time fulfils the Complete Year when all the eight circuits, with their relative speeds, finish together and come to a head, when measured by the revolution of the Same and Similarly-moving.  In this wise and for these reasons were generated all those stars which turn themselves about as they travel through Heaven, to the end that this Universe might be as similar as possible to the perfect and intelligible Living Creature in respect of its imitation of the Eternal\nNature thereof.Now in all other respects this World had already, with the birth of Time, been wrought in the similitude of that whereunto it was being likened, but inasmuch as it did not as yet contain generated within it the whole range of living creatures, therein it was still dissimilar.  So this part of the work which was still undone He completed by molding it after the nature of the Model.  According, then, as Reason perceives Forms existing in the Absolute Living Creature, such and so many as exist therein did He deem that this World also should possess.  And these Forms are four,one the heavenly kind of gods;\nanother the winged kind which traverses the air;  thirdly, the class which inhabits the waters;  and fourthly, that which goes on foot on dry land.  The form of the divine class He wrought for the most part out of fire, that this kind might be as bright as possible to behold and as fair;  and likening it to the All He made it truly spherical;  and He placed it in the intelligence of the Supreme to follow therewith, distributing it round about over all the Heaven, to be unto it a veritable adornment cunningly traced over the whole.  And each member of this class He endowed with two motions, whereof the one is uniform motion in the same spot, whereby it conceives always identical thoughts about the same objects,\nand the other is a forward motion due to its being dominated by the revolution of the Same and Similar;  but in respect of the other five motions they are at rest and move not, so that each of them may attain the greatest possible perfection.  From this cause, then, came into existence all those unwandering stars which are living creatures divine and eternal and abide for ever revolving uniformly in the same spot;  and those which keep swerving and wandering have been generated in the fashion previously described.  And Earth, our nurse, which is globed around the pole that stretches through all,\nHe framed to be the wardress and fashioner of night and day, she being the first and eldest of all the gods which have come into existence within the Heaven.  But the choric dances of these same stars and their crossings one of another, and the relative reversals and progressions of their orbits, and which of the gods meet in their conjunctions, and how many are in opposition, and behind which and at what times they severally pass before one another and are hidden from our view, and again re-appearing\nsend upon men unable to calculate alarming portents of the things which shall come to pass hereafter,to describe all this without an inspection of models of these movements would be labor in vain.  Wherefore, let this account suffice us, and let our discourse concerning the nature of the visible and generated gods have an end.Concerning the other divinities, to discover and declare their origin is too great a task for us, and we must trust to those who have declared it aforetime, they being, as they affirmed, descendants of gods and knowing well, no doubt, their own forefathers.\nIt is, as I say, impossible to disbelieve the children of gods, even though their statements lack either probable or necessary demonstration;  and inasmuch as they profess to speak of family matters, we must follow custom and believe them.  Therefore let the generation of these gods be stated by us, following their account, in this wise:  Of Ge and Uranus were born the children Oceanus and Tethys;  and of these, Phorkys, Cronos, Rhea, and all that go with them;\nand of Cronos and Rhea were born Zeus and Hera and all those who are, as we know, called their brethren;  and of these again, other descendants.Now when all the gods, both those who revolve manifestly and those who manifest themselves so far as they choose, had come to birth, He that generated this All addressed them thus:Gods of gods, those works whereof I am framer and father are indissoluble save by my will.  For though all that is bound may be dissolved,\nyet to will to dissolve that which is fairly joined together and in good case were the deed of a wicked one.  Wherefore ye also, seeing that ye were generated, are not wholly immortal or indissoluble, yet in no wise shall ye be dissolved nor incur the doom of death, seeing that in my will ye possess a bond greater and more sovereign than the bonds wherewith, at your birth, ye were bound together.  Now, therefore, what I manifest and declare unto you do ye learn.  Three mortal kinds still remain ungenerated;  but if these come not into being the Heaven will be imperfect;  for it will not contain within itself the whole sum of the hinds of living creatures, yet contain them it must if\nit is to be fully perfect.  But if by my doing these creatures came into existence and partook of life, they would be made equal unto gods;  in order, therefore, that they may be mortal and that this World-all may be truly All, do ye turn yourselves, as Nature directs, to the work of fashioning these living creatures, imitating the power showed by me in my generating of you.  Now so much of them as it is proper to designate 'immortal,' the part we call divine which rules supreme in those who are fain to follow justice always and yourselves, that part I will deliver unto you when I have sown it and given it origin.\nFor the rest, do ye weave together the mortal with the immortal, and thereby fashion and generate living creatures, and give them food that they may grow, and when they waste away receive them to yourselves again.Thus He spake, and once more into the former bowl, wherein He had blended and mixed the Soul of the Universe, He poured the residue of the previous material, mixing it in somewhat the same manner, yet no longer with a uniform and invariable purity, but second and third in degree of purity.  And when He had compounded the whole He divided it into souls equal in number to the stars, and each several soul He assigned to one star,\nand setting them each as it were in a chariot He showed them the nature of the Universe, and declared unto them the laws of destiny,namely, how that the first birth should be one and the same ordained for all, in order that none might be slighted by Him;  and how it was needful that they, when sown each into his own proper organ of time, should grow into the most god-fearing of living creatures;\nand that, since human nature is two-fold, the superior sex is that which hereafter should be designated man.  And when, by virtue of Necessity, they should be implanted in bodies, and their bodies are subject to influx and efflux, these results would necessarily follow,firstly, sensation that is innate and common to all proceeding from violent affections;  secondly, desire mingled with pleasure and pain;  and besides these, fear and anger\nand all such emotions as are naturally allied thereto, and all such as are of a different and opposite character.  And if they shall master these they will live justly, but if they are mastered, unjustly.  And he that has lived his appointed time well shall return again to his abode in his native star, and shall gain a life that is blessed and congenial but whoso has failed therein shall be changed into woman's nature at the second birth; and if, in that shape, he still refraineth not from wickedness\nhe shall be changed every time, according to the nature of his wickedness, into some bestial form after the similitude of his own nature;  nor in his changings shall he cease from woes until he yields himself to the revolution of the Same and Similar that is within him, and dominating by force of reason that burdensome mass which afterwards adhered to him of fire and water\nand earth and air, a mass tumultuous and irrational, returns again to the semblance of his first and best state.When He had fully declared unto them all these ordinances, to the end that He might be blameless in respect of the future wickedness of any one of them, He proceeded to sow them, some in the Earth, some in the , others in the rest of the organs of Time.  Following upon this sowing, He delivered over to the young gods the task of molding mortal bodies, and of framing and controlling all the rest of the human soul which it was still necessary to add, together with all that belonged thereto,\nand of governing this mortal creature in the fairest and best way possible, to the utmost of their power, except in so far as it might itself become the cause of its own evils.So He, then, having given all these commands, was abiding in His own proper and wonted state.  And as He thus abode, His children gave heed to their Father's command and obeyed it.  They took the immortal principle of the mortal living creature, and imitating their own Maker, they borrowed from the Cosmos portions of fire and earth and water and air,\nas if meaning to pay them back, and the portions so taken they cemented together;  but it was not with those indissoluble bonds wherewith they themselves were joined that they fastened together the portions but with numerous pegs, invisible for smallness;  and thus they constructed out of them all each several body, and within bodies subject to inflow and outflow they bound the revolutions of the immortal Soul.  The souls, then, being thus bound within a mighty river neither mastered it nor were mastered, but with violence they rolled along and were rolled along themselves,\nso that the whole of the living creature was moved, but in such a random way that its progress was disorderly and irrational, since it partook of all the six motions:  for it progressed forwards and backwards, and again to right and to left, and upwards and downwards, wandering every way in all the six directions.  For while the flood which foamed in and streamed out, as it supplied the food, was immense, still greater was the tumult produced\nwithin each creature as a result of the colliding bodies, when the body of a creature happened to meet and collide with alien fire from without, or with a solid lump of earth or liquid glidings of waters, or when it was overtaken by a tempest of winds driven by air, and when the motions due to all these causes rushing through the body impinged upon the Soul.  And for these reasons all such motions were then termed Sensations, and are still so termed today.  Moreover, since at that time they were causing, for the moment, constant and widespread motion, joining with the perpetually flowing stream\nin moving and violently shaking the revolutions of the Soul, they totally blocked the course of the Same by flowing contrary thereto, and hindered it thereby in its ruling and its going;  while, on the other hand, they so shook up the course of the Other that in the three several intervals of the double and the triple, and in the mean terms and binding links of the 3/2, 4/3 and 9/8,these being not wholly dissoluble save by Him who had bound them together,they produced all manner of twistings, and caused\nin their circles fractures and disruptions of every possible kind, with the result that, as they barely held together one with another, they moved indeed but moved irrationally, being at one time reversed, at another oblique, and again upside down.  Suppose, for example, that a man is in an upside down position, with his head resting on the earth and his feet touching something above, then, in this position of the man relative to that of the onlookers, his right will appear left to them, and his left right, and so will theirs to him.  This, and such like, are just what the revolutions of the Soul experience with intensity;\nand every time they happen upon any external object, whether it be of the class of the Same or of the Other, they proclaim it to be the same as something or other than something contrary to the truth, and thereby prove themselves false and foolish, and devoid, at such times, of any revolution that rules and guides.  And whenever external sensations in their movement collide with these revolutions and sweep along with them also the whole vessel of the Soul, then the revolutions, though actually mastered, appear to have the mastery.  Hence it comes about that, because of all these affections, now as in the beginning,\nso often as the Soul is bound within a mortal body it becomes at the first irrational. But as soon as the stream of increase and nutriment enters in less volume, and the revolutions calm down and pursue their own path, becoming more stable as time proceeds, then at length, as the several circles move each according to its natural track, their revolutions are straightened out and they announce the Same and the Other aright, and thereby they render their possessor intelligent.  And if so be\nthat this state of his soul be reinforced by right educational training, the man becomes wholly sound and faultless, having escaped the worst of maladies; but if he has been wholly negligent therein, after passing a lame existence in life he returns again unperfected and unreasoning to Hades.  These results, however, come about at a later time. Regarding the subjects now before us, we must give a more exact exposition;  and also regarding the subjects anterior to these, namely, the generation of bodies in their several parts, and the causes and divine counsels whereby the Soul has come into existence, we must hold fast to the most probable account,\nand proceed accordingly, in the exposition now to be given.The divine revolutions, which are two, they bound within a sphere-shaped body, in imitation of the spherical form of the All, which body we now call the head, it being the most divine part and reigning over all the parts within us.  To it the gods delivered over the whole of the body they had assembled to be its servant, having formed the notion that it should partake in all the motions which were to be.\nIn order, then, that it should not go rolling upon the earth, which has all manner of heights and hollows, and be at a loss how to climb over the one and climb out of the other, they bestowed upon it the body as a vehicle and means of transport.  And for this reason the body acquired length, and, by God's contriving, shot forth four limbs, extensible and flexible,\nto serve as instruments of transport, so that grasping with these and' supported thereon it was enabled to travel through all places, bearing aloft the chamber of our most divine and holy part.  In this wise and for these reasons were legs and hands attached to all men;  and inasmuch as they demand the forepart superior to the hinder part in honor and dignity, the Gods gave us the most part of our going in this direction.  Thus it was necessary that man should have the forepart of his body distinct and dissimilar.  Wherefore, dealing first with the vessel of the head, they set the face in the front thereof\nand bound within it organs for all the forethought of the Soul;  and they ordained that this, which is the natural front, should be the leading part.  And of the organs they constructed first light-bearing eyes, and these they fixed in the face for the reason following.  They contrived that all such fire as had the property not of burning but of giving a mild light should form a body akin to the light of every day. For they caused the pure fire within us, which is akin to that of day, to flow through the eyes in a smooth and dense stream;\nand they compressed the whole substance, and especially the center, of the eyes, so that they occluded all other fire that was coarser and allowed only this pure kind of fire to filter through.  So whenever the stream of vision is surrounded by midday light, it flows out like unto like, and coalescing therewith it forms one kindred substance along the path of the eyes' vision, wheresoever the fire which streams from within collides with an obstructing object without.  And this substance, having all become similar in its properties because of its similar nature,\ndistributes the motions of every object it touches, or whereby it is touched, throughout all the body even unto the Soul, and brings about that sensation which we now term seeing.  But when the kindred fire vanishes into night, the inner fire is cut off;  for when it issues forth into what is dissimilar it becomes altered in itself and is quenched, seeing that it is no longer of like nature with the adjoining air, since that air is devoid of fire.  Wherefore it leaves off seeing, and becomes also an inducement to sleep.  For the eyelids whose structure the Gods devised\nas a safeguard for the vision,when they are shut close, curb the power of the inner fire;  which power dissipates and allays the inward motions, and upon their allaying quiet ensues;  and when this quiet has become intense there falls upon us a sleep that is well-nigh dreamless;  but when some greater motions are still left behind, according to their nature and the positions they occupy\nsuch and so great are the images they produce, which images are copied within and are remembered by the sleepers when they awake out of the dream.  And it is no longer difficult to perceive the truth about the formation of images in mirrors and in bright and smooth surfaces of every kind.  It is from the combination with each other of the inner and the outer fires, every time that they unite on the smooth surface and are variously deflected,\nthat all such reflections necessarily result, owing to the fire of the reflected face coalescing with the fire of the vision on the smooth and bright surface. And left appears as right, because contact takes place between opposite portions of the visual stream and opposite portions of the object, contrary to the regular mode of collision.  Contrariwise, right appears as right and left as left whenever the fire changes sides on coalescing with the object\nwherewith it coalesces;  and this occurs whenever the smooth surface of the mirrors, being elevated on this side and on that, repels the right portion of the visual stream to the left and the left to the right.  And when this same mirror is turned lengthwise to the face it makes the whole face appear upside down, since it repels the bottom of the ray to the top, and conversely the top to the bottom.Now all these are among the auxiliary Causes which God employs as his ministers in perfecting, so far as possible,\nthe Form of the Most Good;  but by the most of men they are supposed to be not auxiliary but primary causes of all thingscooling and heating, solidifying and dissolving, and producing all such effects.  Yet they are incapable of possessing reason and thought for any purpose.  For, as we must affirm, the one and only existing thing which has the property of acquiring thought is Soul;  and Soul is invisible, whereas fire and water and earth and air are all visible bodies;   and the lover of thought and knowledge must needs pursue first\nthe causes which belong to the Intelligent Nature, and put second all such as are of the class of things which are moved by others, and themselves, in turn, move others because they cannot help it.  And we also must act likewise.  We must declare both kinds of Causes, but keep distinct those which, with the aid of thought, are artificers of things fair and good, and all those which are devoid of intelligence and produce always accidental and irregular effects.Now regarding the auxiliary causes which have helped the eyes to acquire the power which they now possess, let this statement suffice.  Next we must declare the most important\nbenefit effected by them, for the sake of which God bestowed them upon us.  Vision, in my view, is the cause of the greatest benefit to us, inasmuch as none of the accounts now given concerning the Universe would ever have been given if men had not seen the stars or the sun or the heaven.  But as it is, the vision of day and night and of months and circling years has created the art of number and has given us not only the notion of Time but also means of research into the nature of the Universe.  From these we have procured Philosophy in all its range,\nthan which no greater boon ever has come or will come, by divine bestowal, unto the race of mortals. This I affirm to be the greatest good of eyesight.  As for all the lesser goods, why should we celebrate them?  He that is no philosopher when deprived of the sight thereof may utter vain lamentations! But the cause and purpose of that best good, as we must maintain, is this,that God devised and bestowed upon us vision to the end that we might behold the revolutions of Reason in the Heaven and use them for the revolvings of the reasoning that is within us, these being akin to those,\nthe perturbable to the imperturbable;  and that, through learning and sharing in calculations which are correct by their nature, by imitation of the absolutely unvarying revolutions of the God we might stabilize the variable revolutions within ourselves.Concerning sound also and hearing, once more we make the same declaration, that they were bestowed by the Gods with the same object and for the same reasons;  for it was for these same purposes that speech was ordained, and it makes the greatest contribution thereto;  music too, in so far as it uses audible sound,\nwas bestowed for the sake of harmony. And harmony, which has motions akin to the revolutions of the Soul within us, was given by the Muses to him who makes intelligent use of the Muses, not as an aid to irrational pleasure, as is now supposed, but as an auxiliary to the inner revolution of the Soul, when it has lost its harmony, to assist in restoring it to order and concord with itself.  And because of the unmodulated condition,\ndeficient in grace, which exists in most of us, Rhythm also was bestowed upon us to be our helper by the same deities and for the same ends.The foregoing part of our discourse, save for a small portion, has been an exposition of the operations of Reason;  but we must also furnish an account of what comes into existence through Necessity.\nFor, in truth, this Cosmos in its origin was generated as a compound, from the combination of Necessity and Reason.  And inasmuch as Reason was controlling Necessity by persuading her to conduct to the best end the most part of the things coming into existence, thus and thereby it came about, through Necessity yielding to intelligent persuasion, that this Universe of ours was being in this wise constructed at the beginning.  Wherefore if one is to declare how it actually came into being on this wise, he must include also the form of the Errant Cause, in the way that it really acts.  To this point, therefore, we must return,\nand taking once again a fresh starting point suitable to the matter we must make a fresh start in dealing therewith, just as we did with our previous subjects.  We must gain a view of the real nature of fire and water, air and earth, as it was before the birth of Heaven, and the properties they had before that time;  for at present no one has as yet declared their generation, but we assume that men know what fire is, and each of these things, and we call them principles and presume that they are elements of the Universe, although in truth they do not so much as deserve to be likened with any likelihood,\nby the man who has even a grain of sense, to the class of syllables.  For the present, however, let our procedure be as follows.  We shall not now expound the principle of all thingsor their principles, or whatever term we use concerning them;  and that solely for this reason, that it is difficult for us to explain our views while keeping to our present method of exposition. You, therefore, ought not to suppose that I should expound them, while as for meI should never be able to convince myself that I should be right in attempting to undertake so great a task.  Strictly adhering, then,\nto what we previously affirmed, the import of the likely account, I will essay (as I did before) to give as likely an exposition as any other (nay, more so), regarding both particular things and the totality of things from the very beginning.  And as before, so now, at the commencement of our account, we must call upon God the Saviour to bring us safe through a novel and unwonted exposition\nto a conclusion based on likelihood, and thus begin our account once more.We must, however, in beginning our fresh account of the Universe make more distinctions than we did before;  for whereas then we distinguished two Forms, we must now declare another third kind.  For our former exposition those two were sufficient, one of them being assumed as a Model Form, intelligible and ever uniformly existent,\nand the second as the model's Copy, subject to becoming and visible.  A third kind we did not at that time distinguish, considering that those two were sufficient;  but now the argument seems to compel us to try to reveal by words a Form that is baffling and obscure.  What essential property, then, are we to conceive it to possess?  This in particular,that it should be the receptacle, and as it were the nurse, of all Becoming.  Yet true though this statement is, we must needs describe it more plainly.\nThat, however, is a difficult task, especially because it is necessary, for its sake, to discuss first the problem of fire and its fellow elements.  For in regard to these it is hard to say which particular element we ought really to term water rather than fire, and which we ought to term any one element rather than each and all of them, while still employing a terminology that is reliable and stable.  How, then, shall we handle this problem, and what likely solution can we offer?  First of all, we see that which we now call water becoming by condensation,\nas we believe, stones and earth;  and again, this same substance, by dissolving and dilating, becoming breath and air;  and air through combustion becoming fire;  and conversely, fire when contracted and quenched returning back to the form of air and air once more uniting and condensing into cloud and mist;  and issuing from these, when still further compressed, flowing water; and from water earth and stones again: thus we see the elements passing on to one another, as it would seem,\nin an unbroken circle the gift of birth.  Accordingly, since no one of these ever remains identical in appearance, which of them shall a man definitely affirm to be any one particular element and no other without incurring ridicule?  None such exists.  On the contrary, by far the safest plan in treating of these elements is to proceed thus:  Whatsoever object we perceive to be constantly changing from one state to another, like fire, that object, be it fire, we must never describe as this but as suchlike, nor should we ever call water this but suchlike nor should we describe any other element, as though it possessed stability,\nof all those which we indicate by using the terms this and that and suppose ourselves to refer to a definite object.  For such an object shuns and eludes the names this and that and every name which indicates that they are stable.  Thus we must not call the several elements these, but in regard to each of them and all together we must apply the term suchlike to represent what is always circling round:  thus we shall call that which is constantly suchlike by the name of fire, and so with everything else that is generated.  But that wherein they are always, in appearance,\ncoming severally into existence, and wherefrom in turn they perish, in describing that and that alone should we employ the terms this and that;  whereas, in describing what is suchlikehot, for instance, or white, or any of the opposite qualities, or any compounds thereofwe ought never to apply to it any of these terms.But we must bestir ourselves to explain this matter again yet more clearly.  Now imagine that a man were to model all possible figures out of gold, and were then to proceed without cessation to remodel each of these into every other, then, if someone were to point to one of the figures and ask what it is,\nby far the safest reply, in point of truth, would be that it is gold;  but as for the triangle and all the other figures which were formed in it, one should never describe them as being seeing that they change even while one is mentioning them;  rather one should be content if the figure admits of even the title suchlike being applied to it with any safety.  And of the substance which receives all bodies\nthe same account must be given.  It must be called always by the same name;  for from its own proper quality it never departs at all for while it is always receiving all things, nowhere and in no wise does it assume any shape similar to any of the things that enter into it.  For it is laid down by nature as a molding-stuff for everything, being moved and marked by the entering figures, and because of them it appears different at different times.  And the figures that enter and depart are copies of those that are always existent, being stamped from them in a fashion marvellous and hard to describe, which we shall investigate hereafter.For the present, then, we must conceive of three kinds,the Becoming, that Wherein it becomes, and the source Wherefrom the Becoming\nis copied and produced.  Moreover, it is proper to liken the Recipient to the Mother, the Source to the Father, and what is engendered between these two to the Offspring;  and also to perceive that, if the stamped copy is to assume diverse appearances of all sorts, that substance wherein it is set and stamped could not possibly be suited to its purpose unless it were itself devoid of all those forms which it is about to receive from any quarter.\nFor were it similar to any of the entering forms, on receiving forms of an opposite or wholly different kind, as they arrived, it would copy them badly, through obtruding its own visible shape.  Wherefore it is right that the substance which is to receive within itself all the kinds should be void of all forms;  just as with all fragrant ointments, men bring about this condition by artistic contrivance and make the liquids which are to receive the odors as odorless as possible;  and all who essay to mold figures in any soft material utterly refuse to allow any previous figure to remain visible therein, and begin by making it even and as smooth as possible before they execute the work.\nSo likewise it is right that the substance which is to be fitted to receive frequently over its whole extent the copies of all things intelligible and eternal should itself, of its own nature, be void of all the forms.  Wherefore, let us not speak of her that is the Mother and Receptacle of this generated world, which is perceptible by sight and all the senses, by the name of earth or air or fire or water, or any aggregates or constituents thereof:  rather, if we describe her as a Kind invisible and unshaped, all-receptive, and in some most perplexing and most baffling way partaking of the intelligible,\nwe shall describe her truly.In so far as it is possible to arrive at the nature of this kind from the foregoing account, one may state it most correctly in this way.  That part of it which is made fiery appears each time as fire, that which has been liquefied as water;  and it appears as earth and air in so far as it receives copies of these.  But let us investigate the matter by more exact reasoning, and consider this question.  Does there exist any self-subsisting fire\nor any of those other objects which we likewise term self-subsisting realities?   Or is it only these things which we see, or otherwise perceive by means of bodily senses, that exist, possessed of sensible reality;  beside which no other things exist anywhere or anyhow, and it is merely an idle assertion of ours that there always exists an intelligible Form of every object, whereas it is really nothing more than a verbal phrase?  Now, on the one hand, it would be improper to dismiss the question before us without a trial and a verdict, and simply to asseverate that the fact is so;  while, on the other hand, we ought not to burden a lengthy discourse with another subsidiary argument.\nIf, however, it were possible to disclose briefly some main determining principle, that would best serve our purpose.This, then, is the view for which I, for my part, cast my vote.  If Reason and True Opinion are two distinct Kinds, most certainly these self-subsisting Forms do exist, imperceptible by our senses, and objects of Reason only;  whereas if, as appears to some, True Opinion differs in naught from Reason, then, on the contrary, all the things which we perceive by our bodily senses must be judged to be most stable.\nNow these two Kinds must be declared to be two, because they have come into existence separately and are unlike in condition.  For the one of them arises in us by teaching, the other by persuasion;  and the one is always in company with true reasoning, whereas the other is irrational;  and the one is immovable by persuasion, whereas the other is alterable by persuasion;  and of the one we must assert that every man partakes, but of Reason only the gods and but a small class of men.  This being so, we must agree that One Kind\nis the self-identical Form, ungenerated and indestructible, neither receiving into itself any other from any quarter nor itself passing anywhither into another, invisible and in all ways imperceptible by sense, it being the object which it is the province of Reason to contemplate;  and a second Kind is that which is named after the former and similar thereto, an object perceptible by sense, generated, ever carried about, becoming in a place and out of it again perishing, apprehensible by Opinion with the aid of Sensation;  and a third Kind is ever-existing Place,\nwhich admits not of destruction, and provides room for all things that have birth, itself being apprehensible by a kind of bastard reasoning by the aid of non-sensation, barely an object of belief;  for when we regard this we dimly dream and affirm that it is somehow necessary that all that exists should exist  some spot and occupying some , and that that which is neither on earth nor anywhere in the Heaven is nothing.  So because of all these and other kindred notions, we are unable also on waking up to distinguish clearly the unsleeping and truly subsisting substance, owing to our dreamy condition,\nor to state the truthhow that it belongs to a copyseeing that it has not for its own even that substance for which it came into being, but fleets ever as a phantom of something elseto come into existence  some other thing, clinging to existence as best it may, on pain of being nothing at all;  whereas to the aid of the really existent there comes the accurately true argument, that so long as one thing is one thing, and another something different, neither of the two will ever come to exist in the other so that the same thing becomes simultaneously\nboth one and two.Let this, then, be, according to my verdict, a reasoned account of the matter summarily stated,that Being and Place and Becoming were existing, three distinct things, even before the Heaven came into existence;  and that the Nurse of Becoming, being liquefied and ignified and receiving also the forms of earth and of air, and submitting to all the other affections which accompany these,\nexhibits every variety of appearance;  but owing to being filled with potencies that are neither similar nor balanced, in no part of herself is she equally balanced, but sways unevenly in every part, and is herself shaken by these forms and shakes them in turn as she is moved.  And the forms, as they are moved, fly continually in various directions and are dissipated;  just as the particles that are shaken and winnowed by the sieves and other instruments used for the cleansing of corn fall in one place if they are solid and heavy,\nbut fly off and settle elsewhere if they are spongy and light.  So it was also with the Four Kinds when shaken by the Recipient:  her motion, like an instrument which causes shaking, was separating farthest from one another the dissimilar, and pushing most closely together the similar;  wherefore also these Kinds occupied different places even before that the Universe was organized and generated out of them.Before that time, in truth, all these things were in a state devoid of reason or measure, but when the work of setting in order this Universe was being undertaken,\nfire and water and earth and air, although possessing some traces of their own nature, were yet so disposed as everything is likely to be in the absence of God;  and inasmuch as this was then their natural condition, God began by first marking them out into shapes by means of forms and numbers.  And that God constructed them, so far as He could, to be as fair and good as possible, whereas they had been otherwise,this above all else must always be postulated in our account.  Now, however, it is the disposition and origin\nof each of these Kinds which I must endeavor to explain to you in an exposition of an unusual type;  yet, inasmuch as you have some acquaintance with the technical method which I must necessarily employ in my exposition, you will follow me.In the first place, then, it is plain I presume to everyone that fire and earth and water and air are solid bodies;  and the form of a body, in every case, possesses depth also.  Further, it is absolutely necessary that depth should be bounded by a plane surface;  and the rectilinear plane is composed of triangles.\nNow all triangles derive their origin from two triangles, each having one angle right and the others acute;  and the one of these triangles has on each side half a right angle marked off by equal sides, while the other has the right angle divided into unequal parts by unequal sides.  These we lay down as the principles of fire and all the other bodies, proceeding according to a method in which the probable is combined with the necessary;  but the principles which are still higher than these are known only to God and the man who is dear to God.\nWe must now declare what will be the four fairest bodies, dissimilar to one another, but capable in part of being produced out of one another by means of dissolution; for if we succeed herein we shall grasp the truth concerning the generation of earth and fire and the mean proportionals.  For to no one will we concede that fairer bodies than these, each distinct of its kind, are anywhere to be seen.  Wherefore we must earnestly endeavor to frame together these four kinds of bodies which excel in beauty, and to maintain that we have apprehended\ntheir nature adequately.  Now of the two triangles, the isosceles possesses one single nature, but the scalene an infinite number;  and of these infinite natures we must select the fairest, if we mean to make a suitable beginning.  If, then, anyone can claim that he has chosen one that is fairer for the construction of these bodies, he, as friend rather than foe, is the victor.  We, however, shall pass over all the rest and postulate as the fairest of the triangles that triangle out of which, when two are conjoined,\nthe equilateral triangle is constructed as a third.  The reason why is a longer story;  but should anyone refute us and discover that it is not so, we begrudge him not the prize.  Accordingly, let these two triangles be selected as those wherefrom are contrived the bodies of fire and of the other elements, one being the isosceles, and the other that which always has the square on its greater side three times the square on the lesser side.Moreover, a point about which our previous statement was obscure must now be defined more clearly.  It appeared as if the four Kinds,\nin being generated, all passed through one another into one another, but this appearance was deceptive.  For out of the triangles which we have selected four Kinds are generated, three of them out of that one triangle which has its sides unequal, and the fourth Kind alone composed of the isosceles triangle.  Consequently, they are not all capable of being dissolved into one another so as to form a few large bodies composed of many small ones, or the converse;  but three of them do admit of this process.  For these three are all naturally compounded of one triangle, so that when the larger bodies are dissolved many small ones will form themselves from these same bodies, receiving the shapes that befit them;\nand conversely, when many small bodies are resolved into their triangles they will produce, when unified, one single large mass of another Kind.  So let thus much be declared concerning their generation into one another.In the next place we have to explain the form in which each Kind has come to exist and the numbers from which it is compounded.  First will come that form which is primary and has the smallest components, and the element thereof is that triangle which has its hypotenuse twice as long as its lesser side.  And when a pair of such triangles are joined along the line of the hypotenuse, and this is done thrice, by drawing the hypotenuses\nand the short sides together as to a center, there is produced from those triangles, six in number, one equilateral triangle. And when four equilateral triangles are combined so that three plane angles\nmeet in a point, they form one solid angle, which comes next in order to the most obtuse of the plane angles.  And when four such angles are produced, the first solid figure is constructed, which divides the whole of the circumscribed sphere into equal and similar parts.  And the second solid is formed from the same triangles, but constructed out of eight equilateral triangles, which produce one solid angle out of four planes;  and when six such solid angles have been formed, the second body in turn is completed.\nAnd the third solid is composed of twice sixty of the elemental triangles conjoined, and of twelve solid angles, each contained by five plane equilateral triangles, and it has, by its production, twenty equilateral triangular bases.Now the first of the elemental triangles ceased acting when it had generated these three solids, the substance of the fourth Kind being generated by the isosceles triangle.  Four of these combined, with their right angles drawn together to the center, produced one equilateral quadrangle;  and six such quadrangles,\nwhen joined together, formed eight solid angles, each composed of three plane right angles;  and the shape of the body thus constructed was cubic, having six plane equilateral quadrangular bases.  And seeing that there still remained one other compound figure, the fifth, God used it up for the Universe in his decoration thereof.Now in reasoning about all these things, a man might question whether he ought to affirm the existence of an infinite diversity of Universes or a limited number;  and if he questioned aright he would conclude that the doctrine of an infinite diversity is that of a man unversed\nin matters wherein he ought to be versed;  but the question whether they ought really to be described as one Universe or five is one which might with more reason give us pause.  Now our view declares the Universe to be essentially one, in accordance with the probable account;  but another man, considering other facts, will hold a different opinion.  Him, however, we must let pass.  But as for the Kinds which have now been generated by our argument, let us assign them severally to fire and earth and water and air.  To earth let us give the cubic form;  for of the four Kinds earth is the most immobile\nand the most plastic body, and of necessity the body which has the most stable bases must be pre-eminently of this character.  Now of the triangles we originally assumed, the basis formed by equal sides is of its nature more stable than that formed by unequal sides;  and of the plane surfaces which are compounded of these several triangles, the equilateral quadrangle, both in its parts and as a whole, has a more stable base than the equilateral triangle.\nWherefore, we are preserving the probable account when we assign this figure to earth, and of the remaining figures the least mobile to water, and the most mobile to fire, and the intermediate figure to air;  and, further, when we assign the smallest body to fire, and the greatest to water, and the intermediate to air;  and again, the first in point of sharpness to fire, the second to air, and the third to water.  As regards all these forms, that which has the fewest bases must necessarily be the most mobile,\nsince it is in all ways the sharpest and most acute of all;  and it must also be the lightest, since it is composed of the fewest identical parts;  and the second comes second in point of these same qualities, and the third third.Thus, in accordance with the right account and the probable, that solid which has taken the form of a pyramid shall be the element and seed of fire;  the second in order of generation we shall affirm to be air, and the third water.  Now one must conceive all these to be so small that none of them,\nwhen taken singly each in its several kind, is seen by us, but when many are collected together their masses are seen.  And, moreover, as regards the numerical proportions which govern their masses and motions and their other qualities, we must conceive that God realized these everywhere with exactness, in so far as the nature of Necessity submitted voluntarily or under persuasion, and thus ordered all in harmonious proportion.From all that we have hitherto said about these Kinds,\nthey will, in all likelihood, behave themselves as follows.  Earth will keep moving when it happens to meet with fire and has been dissolved by its acuteness, whether this dissolution takes place in pure fire or in a mass of air or of water;  and this motion will continue until the particles of earth happen to meet together somewhere and reunite one with another, when they become earth again;  for assuredly earth will never change into another form.  But water, when broken up by fire or even by air, is capable of becoming a compound of one corpuscle of fire with two of air;\nand the fractions of air which come from the dissolving of one particle will form two corpuscles of fire.  And again, when a small quantity of fire is enclosed by a large quantity of air and water, or of earth, and moves within them as they rush along, and is defeated in its struggle and broken up, then two corpuscles of fire unite to make one form of air.  And when air is defeated and disintegrated, from two whole forms of air and a half, one whole form of water will be compounded.\nOnce again let us reason out their character in this way.  Whenever any of the other Kinds is caught within fire it is cut up thereby, owing to the acuteness of its angles and of the line of its sides, but when it has been re-composed into the substance of fire it ceases to be cut;  for the Kind that is similar and uniform is in no case able either to cause any change in, or to suffer any affection from, a Kind which is in a uniform and similar state;  but so long as, in the course of its passage into another form, it is a weaker body fighting against a stronger, it is continually being dissolved.  And again,\nwhenever a few of the smaller corpuscles, being caught within a great number of larger corpuscles, are broken up and quenched, then, if they consent to be re-compounded into the shape of the victorious Kind, they cease to be quenched, and air is produced out of fire, and out of air water;  but if they fight against combining with these or with any of the other Kinds, they do not cease from dissolution until either they are driven out to their own kindred, by means of this impact and dissolution, or else they are defeated and, instead of many forms, assume one form similar to the victorious Kind, and continue dwelling therewith as a united family.  Moreover, it is owing to these affections\nthat they all interchange their places;  for while the bulk of each Kind keeps apart in a region of its own because of the motion of the Recipient, yet those corpuscles which from time to time become dissimilar to themselves and similar to others are carried, because of the shaking, towards the region which belongs to those corpuscles whereto they have been assimilated.Such are the causes which account for the generation of all the unmixed and primary bodies.  But within these four Kinds other classes exist, whereof the cause must be sought in the construction of each of the two elemental triangles, each such construction having originally produced\nnot merely a triangle of one definite size, but larger and smaller triangles of sizes as numerous as are the classes within the Kinds.  Consequently, when these are combined amongst themselves and with one another they are infinite in their variety;  and this variety must be kept in view by those who purpose to employ probable reasoning concerning Nature.Now, unless we can arrive at some agreed conclusion concerning Motion and Rest, as to how and under what conditions they come about,\nour subsequent argument will be greatly hampered.  The facts about them have already been stated in part;  but in addition thereto we must state further that motion never consents to exist within uniformity.  For it is difficult, or rather impossible, for that which is to be moved to exist without that which is to move, or that which is to move without that which is to be moved;  but in the absence of these there is no motion, and that these should ever be uniform is a thing impossible.  Accordingly, we must always place rest in uniformity,\nand motion in non-uniformity;  and the cause of the non-uniform nature lies in inequality.  Now we have explained the origin of inequality; but we have not declared how it is that these bodies are not separated according to their several Kinds, and cease not from their motion and passage one through another.  Wherefore, we shall once more expound the matter as follows.  The revolution of the All, since it comprehends the Kinds, compresses them all, seeing that it is circular and tends naturally to come together to itself;  and thus it suffers no void place to be left.\nWherefore, fire most of all has permeated all things, and in a second degree air, as it is by nature second in fineness;  and so with the rest;  for those that have the largest constituent parts have the largest void left in their construction, and those that have the smallest the least.  Thus the tightening of the compression forces together the small bodies into the void intervals of the large.  Therefore, when small bodies are placed beside large, and the smaller disintegrate the larger while the larger unite the smaller, they all shift up and down\ntowards their own proper regions;  for the change in their several sizes causes their position in space also to change.  And since in this way and for these reasons the production of non-uniformity is perpetually maintained, it brings about unceasingly, both now and for the future, the perpetual motion of these bodies.In the next place, we must observe that there are many kinds of fire:  for example, there is flame;  and the kind issuing from flame, which does not burn but supplies light to the eyes;  and the kind which, when the flame is quenched, is left behind among the embers.\nSo likewise of air, there is the most translucent kind which is called by the name of aether, and the most opaque which is mist and darkness, and other species without a name, which are produced by reason of the inequality of the triangles.  The kinds of water are, primarily, two, the one being the liquid, the other the fusible kind.  Now the liquid kind, inasmuch as it partakes of those small particles of water which are unequal, is mobile both in itself and by external force owing to its non-uniformity and the shape of its figure.  But the other kind, which is composed of large\nand uniform particles, is more stable than the first and is heavy, being solidified by its uniformity;  but when fire enters and dissolves it, this causes it to abandon its uniformity, and this being lost it partakes more largely in motion;  and when it has become mobile it is pushed by the adjacent air and extended upon the earth;  and for each of these modifications it has received a descriptive namemelting for the disintegration of its masses, and for its extension over the earth fluidity.  Again, since the fire on issuing from the water\ndoes not pass into a void but presses on the adjacent air, this in turn compresses the liquid mass which is still mobile into the abodes of the fire and combines it with itself;  and the mass, being this, is compressed and recovering again its uniformity, because of the departure of the fire, the author of its non-uniformity, returns to its state of self-identity.  And this cessation of the fire is termed cooling, and the combination which follows on its departure solidification.\nOf all the kinds of water which we have termed fusible, the densest is produced from the finest and most uniform particles:  this is a kind of unique form, tinged with a glittering and yellow hue, even that most precious of possessions, gold, which has been strained through stones and solidified.  And the off-shoot of gold, which is very hard because of its density and black in color, is called adamant. And the kind which closely resembles gold in its particles but has more forms than one, and in density is more dense than gold, and partakes of small and fine portions of earth so that it is harder, while it is also lighter\nowing to its having large interstices within it,this particular kind of the bright and solid waters, being compounded thus, is termed bronze.  And the portion of earth that is mixed therewith becomes distinct by itself, when both grow old and separate again-each from the other;  and then it is named rust.And the rest of such phenomena it is no longer difficult to explain in full, if one aims at framing a description that is probable. For as regards this, whenever for the sake of recreation a man lays aside arguments concerning eternal Realities and considers probable accounts of Becoming,\ngaining thereby a pleasure not to be repented of, he provides for his life a pastime that is both moderate and sensible.  To this pastime let us now give free play, and proceed to expound in order the subsequent probabilities concerning these same phenomena in the following way.The water that is mixed with fire, which is fine and fluid, is termed fluid, owing to its motion and the way it rolls over the earth. Also it is soft owing to the fact that its bases, being less stable than those of earth, give way.  When this kind is separated off from fire and air and isolated it becomes more uniform,\nbut because of their outflow it is compressed upon itself;  and when it is thus solidified, the part of it above the earth which is most affected by this process is termed hail, and the part upon the earth ice and the part which is less affected and is still only half-solid is called snow when it is above the earth, but when it is upon the earth and solidified out of dew it is called hoar-frost.Now as regards most forms of water that are intermingled one with another, the kind as a whole, consisting of water that has been strained through earth-grown plants,\nis called sap;  but inasmuch as the several sorts have become dissimilar owing to intermixture, most of the kinds thus produced are unnamed.  Four of these kinds, however, being fiery and specially conspicuous, have received names.  Of these, that which is heating to the soul as well as the body is called wine;  that which is smooth and divisive of the vision, and therefore bright to look upon and gleaming and glistening in appearance, is the species oil, including pitch and castor oil and olive oil itself and all the others that are of the same character;\nand all that kind which tends to expand the contracted parts of the mouth, so far as their nature allows, and by this property produces sweetness, has received as a general designation the name of honey;  and the foamy kind, which tends to dissolve the flesh by burning, and is secreted from all the saps, is named verjuice.Of the species of earth, that which is strained through water becomes a stony substance in the following way.  When the water commingled therewith is divided in the process of mingling, it changes into the form of air;  and when it has become air it rushes up to its own region;\nbut because there was no void space above them, therefore it pressed against the adjacent air;  and it, being heavy, when pressed and poured round the mass of earth, crushed it forcibly and compressed it into the spaces from which the new air was ascending.  But when earth is thus compressed by the air so as to be indissoluble by water it forms stone;  of which the fairer sort is that composed of equal and uniform parts and transparent, and the coarser sort the opposite.  That kind from which all the moisture has been carried off by the rapidity of fire, and which is more brittle\nin its composition than the first kind, is the kind to which we have given the name of earthenware.  But sometimes, when moisture is still left in the earth and it has been fused by fire and has cooled again, it forms the species which is black in hue.  On the other hand there are two kinds, which, in exactly the same manner, are isolated after the mixture from much of their water, but are composed of finer parts of earth, and are saline:  when these have become semi-solid and soluble again by water, one of them is purgative of oil and earth and forms the species called lye;  and the other, which blends well with the combinations which affect the sensation of the mouth,\nis that substance which is customarily termed beloved of the gods, namely salt.As regards the kinds which are a blend of these two, and are dissoluble by fire and not by water, their composition is due to the following cause.  Fire and air do not melt masses of earth;  for, inasmuch as their particles are smaller then the interstices of its structure, they have room to pass through without forcible effort and leave the earth undissolved, with the result that it remains unmelted;  whereas the particles of water, being larger, must use force to make their way out, and consequently dissolve and melt the earth.\nThus earth when it is not forcibly condensed is dissolved only by water;  and when it is condensed it is dissolved by fire only, since no entrance is left for anything save fire.  Water, again, when most forcibly massed together is dissolved by fire only, but when massed less forcibly both by fire and air, the latter acting by way of the interstices, and the former by way of the triangles;  but air when forcibly condensed is dissolved by nothing save by way of its elemental triangles, and when unforced it is melted down by fire only.As regards the classes of bodies which are compounds of earth and water,\nso long as the water occupies the interspaces of earth which are forcibly contracted, the portions of water which approach from without find no entrance, but flow round the whole mass and leave it undissolved.  But when portions of fire enter into the interspaces of the water they produce the same effects on water as water does on earth;  consequently, they are the sole causes why the compound substance is dissolved and flows.  And of these substances those which contain less water than earth form the whole kind known as glass,\nand all the species of stone called fusible;  while those which contain more water include all the solidified substances of the type of wax and frankincense.And now we have explained with some fullness the Four Kinds, which are thus variegated in their shapes and combinations and permutations;  but we have still to try to elucidate the Causes which account for their affective qualities.  Now, first of all, the quality of sense-perceptibility must always belong to the objects under discussion;  but we have not as yet described the generation of flesh and the appurtenances of flesh, nor of that portion of Soul which is mortal.  But, in truth, these last cannot be adequately explained\napart from the subject of the sensible affections, nor the latter without the former;  while to explain both simultaneously is hardly possible.  Therefore, we must assume one of the two, to begin with, and return later to discuss our assumptions.  In order, then, that the affective properties may be treated next after the kinds, let us presuppose the facts about body and soul.Firstly, then, let us consider how it is that we call fire hot by noticing the way it acts\nupon our bodies by dividing and cutting.  That its property is one of sharpness we all, I suppose, perceive;  but as regards the thinness of its sides and the acuteness of its angles and the smallness of its particles and the rapidity of its motionowing to all which properties fire is intense and keen and sharply cuts whatever it encounters,these properties we must explain by recalling\nthe origin of its form, how that it above all others is the one substance which so divides our bodies and minces them up as to produce naturally both that affection which we call heat and its very name.The opposite affection is evident, but none the less it must not lack description.  When liquids with larger particles, which surround the body, enter into it they drive out the smaller particles;  but as they cannot pass into their room they compress the moisture within us, so that in place of non-uniformity and motion they produce immobility and density,\nas a result of the uniformity and compression.  But that which is being contracted contrary to nature fights, and, in accordance with its nature, thrusts itself away in the contrary direction.  And to this fighting and shaking we give the names of trembling and shivering;  while this affection as a whole, as well as the cause thereof, is termed cold.By the term hard we indicate all the things to which our flesh gives way;  and by the term soft all those which give way to our flesh;  and these terms are similarly used relatively to each other.  Now a substance gives way when it has its base small;  but when it is constructed\nof quadrangular bases, being very firmly based, it is a most inelastic form;  and so too is everything which is of very dense composition and most rigid.The nature of heavy and light would be shown most clearly if, along with them, we examined also the nature of above and below, as they are called.  That there really exist two distinct and totally opposite regions, each of which occupies one-half of the Universethe one termed below, towards which move all things possessing any bodily mass, and the other above, towards which everything goes against its will,\nthis is a wholly erroneous supposition For inasmuch as the whole Heaven is spherical, all its outermost parts, being equally distant from the center, must really be outermost in a similar degree;  and one must conceive of the center, which is distant from all the outermost parts by the same measures, as being opposite to them all.  Seeing, then, that the Cosmos is actually of this nature, which of the bodies mentioned can one set above or below without incurring justly the charge of applying a wholly unsuitable name?  For its central region cannot rightly be termed either above or below, but just central;  while its circumference neither is central nor has it any one part more divergent than another from the center or any of its opposite parts.  But to that which is in all ways uniform, what opposite names can we suppose are rightly applicable, or in what sense?  For suppose there were a solid body evenly-balanced at the center of the universe,\nit would never be carried away to the extremities because of their uniformity in all respects;  nay, even were a man to travel round it in a circle he would often call the same part of it both above and below, according as he stood now at one pole, now at the opposite. For seeing that the Whole is, as we said just now, spherical, the assertion that it has one region above and one below does not become a man of sense.Now the origin of these names and their true meaning which accounts for our habit of making these verbal distinctions even about the whole Heaven,\nwe must determine on the basis of the following principles.  Suppose that a man were to take his stand in that region of the Universe in which the substance of fire has its special abode, and where also that substance to which it flies is collected in largest bulk;  and suppose that, having the power to do so, he were to separate portions of the fire and weigh them, putting them on scales and lifting the balance and pulling the fire by force into the dissimilar air, it is obvious that he will force the smaller mass more easily than the larger.\nFor if two masses are lifted up simultaneously by a single effort, the smaller will necessarily yield more and the larger less, owing to its resistance, to the force exerted;  and the large mass will be said to be heavy and moving down, the small light and moving up.  Now this is just what we ought to detect ourselves doing in our region here.  Standing on the earth and detaching various earthy substances, and sometimes pure earth, we pull them into the dissimilar air by force and against nature, since both these kinds cleave to their own kindred;\nand the smaller mass yields more easily, and follows first, as we force it into the dissimilar kind;  wherefore we name it light, and the region to which we force it above;  and the conditions opposite thereto we name heavy and below.  Thus, these must necessarily differ in their mutual relations, because the main masses of the Kinds occupy regions opposite to one another;  for when we compare what is light in one region with what is light in the opposite region, and the heavy with the heavy, the below with the below,\nand the above with the above, we shall discover that these all become and are opposite and oblique and in every way different in their mutual relations.  There is, however, this one fact to be noticed about them all, that it is the passage of each kind to its kindred mass which makes the moving body heavy, and the region to which such a body moves below;  while the opposite conditions produce the contrary results. Let this, then, stand as our account of the causes of these conditions.Of smoothness and roughness anyone might be able to discern the causes and explain them also to others.  For the cause of the latter is hardness combined with irregularity, and of the former\nregularity combined with density.In respect of the affections common to the whole body a very important point, which still remains, is the cause of the pleasures and pains attaching to the sense-affections we have been discussing;  and the cause also of those affections which have become perceptible by means of the bodily parts and involve in themselves concomitant pains and pleasures.  Let us, then, try to grasp the causes in connection with every perceptible and imperceptible affection in the following way,\nbearing in mind the distinction we previously drew between mobile and immobile substances;  for it is in this way that we must track down all those facts that we intend to grasp.  Whenever what is naturally mobile is impressed by even a small affection, it transmits it in a circle, the particles passing on to one another this identical impression until they reach the organ of intelligence and announce the quality of the agent.  But a substance of the opposite kind, being stable and having no circular movement, is only affected in itself and does not move any other adjacent particle;  consequently,\nsince the particles do not transmit to one another the original affection, it fails to act  upon the living creature as a whole, and the result is that the affected body is non-percipient.  This is the case with the bones and the hair and all our other parts that are mainly earthy whereas the former character belongs especially to the organs of sight and of hearing, owing to the fact that they contain a very large quantity of fire and air.Now the nature of pleasure and pain we must conceive of in this way.\nWhen an affection which is against nature and violent occurs within us with intensity it is painful, whereas the return back to the natural condition, when intense, is pleasant;  and an affection which is mild and gradual is imperceptible, while the converse is of a contrary character.  And the affection which, in its entirety, takes place with ease is eminently perceptible, but it does not involve pain or pleasure;  such, for example, are the affections of the visual stream itself, which, as we said before, becomes in the daylight a body substantially one with our own.  For no pains are produced therein by cuttings or burnings\nor any other affections, nor does its reversion to its original form produce pleasures;  but it has most intense and clear perceptions concerning every object that affects it, and every object also which it strikes against or touches;  for force is wholly absent both from its dilation and from its contraction.  But those bodied which are composed of larger particles, since they yield with difficulty to the agent and transmit their motions to the whole, feel pleasures and pains\npains when they suffer alteration, and pleasures when they are restored to their original state.  And all those bodies which undergo losses of substance and emptyings that are gradual, but replenishings that are intense and abundant, become insensitive to the emptyings but sensitive to the replenishings;  consequently, they furnish no pains to the mortal part of the soul, but the greatest pleasuresa result which is obvious in the case of perfumes.  But all those parts which undergo violent alterations, and are restored gradually and with difficulty\nto their original condition, produce results the opposite of those last mentioned;  and it is evident that this is what occurs in the case of burnings and cuttings of the body.And now we have given a fairly complete statement of the affections which are common to the body as a whole, and of all the names which belong to the agents which produce them.  Next we must try, if haply we are able, to describe what takes place in the several parts of our bodies, both the affections themselves and the agents to which they are ascribed.\nFirstly, then, we must endeavor to elucidate so far as possible those affections which we omitted in our previous account of the flavors, they being affections peculiar to the tongue.  It is evident that these also, like most others, are brought about by means of certain contractions and dilations;  and, more than other affections, they involve also conditions of roughness and smoothness.  For all the earthy particles which enter in by the small veinswhich, extending as far as to the heart, serve as it were\nfor testing-instruments of the tongue,when they strike upon the moist and soft parts of the flesh and are melted down, contract the small veins and dry them up;  and these particles when more rough appear to be astringent, when less rough harsh. And such as act on these veins as detergents and wash out all the surface of the tongue, when they do this excessively and lay such hold on the tongue as to dissolve part of its substanceand such, for example, is the property of alkalies,\nare all termed bitter;  while those which have a property less strong than the alkaline, being detergent in a moderate degree, seem to us to be saline, and more agreeable, as being devoid of the rough bitterness.  And those which share in the heat of the mouth and are made smooth thereby, when they are fully inflamed and are themselves in turn burning the part which heated them, fly upwards because of their lightness towards the senses of the head and cut all the parts on which they impinge;\nand because of these properties all such are called pungent.  Again, when particles already refined by putrefaction, entering into the narrow veins, are symmetrical with the particles of earth and air contained therein, so that they cause them to circulate round one another and ferment, then, in thus fermenting they change round and pass into fresh places, and thereby create fresh hollows which envelop the entering particles.  By this means, the air being veiled in a moist film,\nsometimes of earth, sometimes of pure moisture, moist and hollow and globular vessels of air are formed;  and those formed of pure moisture are the transparent globules called by the name of bubbles, while those of the earthy formation which moves throughout its mass and seethes are designated boiling and fermenting;  and the cause of these processes is termed acid.An affection which is the opposite of all those last described\nresults from an opposite condition.  Whenever the composition of the particles which enter into the moist parts is naturally akin to the state of the tongue, they oil its roughened parts and smooth it, contracting the parts that are unnaturally dilated or dilating those that are contracted, and thus settling them all, so far as possible, in their natural condition;  and every such remedy of the forcible affections, being pleasant and welcome to everyone, is called sweet.\nFor this subject, then, let this account suffice.  Next, as regards the property of the nostrils, it does not contain fixed kinds.  For the whole range of smells is a half-formed class, and no kind possesses the symmetry requisite for containing any smell;  for our veins in these organs are of too narrow a construction for the kinds of earth and of water and too wide for those of fire and air, so that no one has ever yet perceived any smell from any of these, but only from substances which are in process of being moistened or putrefied or melted or vaporized.\nFor smells arise in the intermediate state, when water is changing into air or air into water, and they are all smoke or mist;  and of these, the passage from air to water is mist, and the passage from water to air is smoke whence it is that all the smells are thinner than water and thicker than air.  Their nature is made clear whenever there is some block in the respiration and a man draws in his breath forcibly;  for then no accompanying smell is strained through, but the breath passes in alone by itself isolated from the smells.  So for these reasons the varieties of these smells have no name,\nnot being derived either from many or from simple forms, but are indicated by two distinctive terms only, pleasant and painful of which the one kind roughens and violently affects the whole of our bodily cavity which lies between the head and the navel, whereas the other mollifies this same region and restores it agreeably to its natural condition.The third organ of perception within us which we have to describe in our survey is that of hearing,\nand the causes whereby its affections are produced.  In general, then, let us lay it down that sound is a stroke transmitted through the ears, by the action of the air upon the brain and the blood, and reaching to the soul;  and that the motion caused thereby, which begins in the head and ends about the seat of the liver, is hearing;  and that every rapid motion produces a shrill sound, and every slower motion a more deep sound;  and that uniform motion produces an even and smooth sound and the opposite kind of motion a harsh sound;\nand that large motion produces loud sound, and motion of the opposite kind soft sound.  The subject of concords of sounds must necessarily be treated in a later part of our exposition.We have still remaining a fourth kind of sensation, which we must divide up seeing that it embraces numerous varieties, which, as a whole, we call  colors. This consists of a flame which issues from the several bodies, and possesses particles so proportioned to the visual stream as to produce sensation;  and as regards the visual stream, we have already stated merely the causes which produced it.\nConcerning colors, then, the following explanation will be the most probable and worthy af a judicious account.  Of the particles which fly off from the rest and strike into the visual stream some are smaller, some larger, and some equal to the particles of the stream itself;  those, then, that are equal are imperceptible, and we term them transparent;  while the larger and smaller particlesof which the one kind contracts, the other dilates the visual streamare akin to the particles of heat and cold which affect the flesh,\nand to the astringent particles which affect the tongue, and to all the heating particles which we call bitter with these white and black are really identical affections, occurring in a separate class of sensation, although they appear different for the causes stated.  These, therefore, are the names we must assign to them:  that which dilates the visual stream is white and the opposite thereof black;  and the more rapid motion, being that of a different species of fire, which strikes upon the visual stream and dilates it as far as to the eyes, and penetrating\nand dissolving the very passages of the eyes causes a volume of fire and water to pour from them, which we call tears.  And this moving body, being itself fire, meets fire from the opposite direction; and as the one firestream is leaping out like a flash, and the other passing in and being quenched in the moisture, in the resultant mixture colors of all kinds are produced.  This sensation we term dazzling and the object which causes it bright or brilliant.  Again, when the kind of fire\nwhich is midway between these reaches to the liquid of the eyes and is mingled therewith, it is not brilliant but, owing to the blending of the fire's ray through the moisture, it gives off a sanguine color, and we give it the name of red.  And bright color when blended with red and white becomes yellow.  But in what proportions the colors are blended it were foolish to declare, even if one knew, seeing that in such matters one could not properly adduce any necessary ground or probable reason.  Red blended with black and white makes purple;\nbut when these colors are mixed and more completely burned, and black is blended therewith, the result is violet.  Chestnut comes from the blending of yellow and grey;  and grey from white and black;  and ochre from white mixed with yellow.  And when white is combined with bright and is steeped in deep black it turns into a dark blue color;  and dark blue mixed with white becomes  light blue;  and chestnut with black becomes green.  As to the rest, it is fairly clear from these examples\nwhat are the mixtures with which we ought to identify them if we would preserve probability in our account.  But should any inquirer make an experimental test of these facts, he would evince his ignorance of the difference between man's nature and Godshow that, whereas God is sufficiently wise and powerful to blend the many into one and to dissolve again the one into many, there exists not now, nor ever will exist hereafter, a child of man sufficient for either of these tasks.\nSuch, then, being the necessary nature of all these things, the Artificer of the most fair and good took them over at that time amongst things generated when He was engendering the self-sufficing and most perfect God;  and their inherent properties he used as subservient causes, but Himself designed the Good in all that was being generated.  Wherefore one ought to distinguish two kinds of causes, the necessary and the divine, and in all things to seek after the divine for the sake of gaining a life of blessedness, so far as our nature admits thereof,\nand to seek the necessary for the sake of the divine, reckoning that without the former it is impossible to discern by themselves alone the divine objects after which we strive, or to apprehend them or in any way partake thereof.Seeing, then, that we have now lying before us and thoroughly siftedlike wood ready for the joiner, the various kinds of causes, out of which the rest of our account must be woven together, let us once more for a moment revert to our starting-point, and thence proceed rapidly to the point\nfrom which we arrived hither.  In this way we shall endeavor now to supplement our story with a conclusion and a crown in harmony with what has gone before.As we stated at the commencement, all these things were in a state of disorder, when God implanted in them proportions both severally in relation to themselves and in their relations to one another, so far as it was in any way possible for them to be in harmony and proportion.  For at that time nothing partook thereof, save by accident, nor was it possible to name anything worth mentioning which bore the names we now give them, such as fire and water,\nor any of the other elements;  but He, in the first place, set all these in order, and then out of these He constructed this present Universe, one single Living Creature containing within itself all living creatures both mortal and immortal.  And He Himself acts as the Constructor of things divine, but the structure of the mortal things He commanded His own engendered sons to execute.  And they, imitating Him, on receiving the immortal principle of soul, framed around it a mortal body, and gave it all the body to be its vehicle, and housed therein besides another form of soul, even the mortal form,\nwhich has within it passions both fearful and unavoidablefirstly, pleasure, a most mighty lure to evil;  next, pains, which put good to rout;  and besides these, rashness and fear, foolish counsellors both and anger, hard to dissuade;  and hope, ready to seduce.  And blending these with irrational sensation and with all-daring lust, they thus compounded in necessary fashion the mortal kind of soul.  Wherefore, since they scrupled to pollute the divine, unless through absolute necessity,\nthey planted the mortal kind apart therefrom in another chamber of the body, building an isthmus and boundary for the head and chest by setting between them the neck, to the end that they might remain apart.  And within the chestor thorax, as it is calledthey fastened the mortal kind of soul.  And inasmuch as one part thereof is better, and one worse, they built a division within the cavity of the thorax\nas if to fence off two separate chambers, for men and for womenby placing the midriff between them as a screen.  That part of the soul, then, which partakes of courage and spirit, since it is a lover of victory, they planted more near to the head, between the midriff and the neck, in order that it might hearken to the reason, and, in conjunction therewith, might forcibly subdue the tribe of the desires whensoever they should utterly refuse to yield willing obedience to the word of command from the citadel of reason.  And the heart,\nwhich is the junction of the veins and the fount of the blood which circulates vigorously through all the limbs, they appointed to be the chamber of the bodyguard, to the end that when the heat of the passion boils up, as soon as reason passes the word round that some unjust action is being done which affects them, either from without or possibly even from the interior desires, every organ of sense in the body might quickly perceive through all the channels both the injunctions and the threats and in all ways obey and follow them, thus allowing their best part\nto be the leader of them all.  And as a means of relief for the leaping of the heart, in times when dangers are expected and passion is excitedsince they knew that all such swelling of the passionate parts would arise from the action of fire,they contrived and implanted the form of the lungs.  This is, in the first place, soft and bloodless;  and, moreover, it contains within it perforated cavities like those of a sponge, so that, when it receives the breath and the drink, it might have a cooling effect and furnish relief and comfort\nin the burning heat.  To this end they drew the channels of the windpipe to the lungs, and placed the lungs as a kind of padding round the heart, in order that, when the passion therein should be at its height, by leaping upon a yielding substance and becoming cool, the heart might suffer less and thereby be enabled the more to be subservient to the reason in time of passion.And all that part of the Soul which is subject to appetites for foods and drinks, and all the other wants that are due to the nature of the body, they planted in the parts midway between the midriff and the boundary\nat the navel, fashioning as it were a manger in all this region for the feeding of the body;  and there they tied up this part of the Soul, as though it were a creature which, though savage, they must necessarily keep joined to the rest and feed, if the mortal stock were to exist at all.  In order, then, that this part, feeding thus at its manger and housed as far away as possible from the counselling part, and creating the least possible turmoil and din, should allow the Supreme part to take counsel in peace\nconcerning what benefits all, both individually and in the mass,for these reasons they stationed it in that position.  And inasmuch as they knew that it would not understand reason, and that, even if it did have some share in the perception of reasons, it would have no natural instinct to pay heed to any of them but would be bewitched for the most part both day and night by images and phantasms,to guard against this God devised and constructed the form of the liver and placed it in that part's abode;\nand He fashioned it dense and smooth and bright and sweet, yet containing bitterness, that the power of thoughts which proceed from the mind, moving in the liver as in a mirror which receives impressions and provides visible images, should frighten this part of the soul;  for when the mental power bears down upon it with stern threats, it uses a kindred portion of the liver's bitterness and makes it swiftly suffuse the whole liver, so that it exhibits bilious colors, and by contraction makes it\nall wrinkled and rough;  moreover, as regards the lobe and passages and gates of the liver, the first of these it bends back from the straight and compresses, while it blocks the others and closes them up, and thus it produces pains and nausea.  On the other hand, when a breath of mildless from the intellect paints on the liver appearances of the opposite kind, and calms down its bitterness by refusing to move or touch the nature opposite to itself, and using upon the liver the sweetness inherent therein\nrectifies all its parts so as to make them straight and smooth and free, it causes the part of the soul planted round the liver to be cheerful and serene, so that in the night it passes its time sensibly, being occupied in its slumbers with divination, seeing that in reason and intelligence it has no share.For they who constructed us, remembering the injunction of their Father, when He enjoined upon them to make the mortal kind\nas good as they possibly could, rectified the vile part of us by thus establishing therein the organ of divination, that it might in some degree lay hold on truth.  And that God gave unto man's foolishness the gift of divination a sufficient token is this:  no man achieves true and inspired divination when in his rational mind, but only when the power of his intelligence is fettered in sleep or when it is distraught by disease or by reason of some divine inspiration.  But it belongs to a man when in his right mind to recollect and ponder both the things spoken in dream or waking vision by the divining and inspired nature, and all the visionary forms that were seen, and by means of reasoning to discern about them all\nwherein they are significant and for whom they portend evil or good in the future, the past, or the present.  But it is not the task of him who has been in a state of frenzy, and still continues therein, to judge the apparitions and voices seen or uttered by himself;  for it was well said of old that to do and to know one's own and oneself belongs only to him who is sound of mind.  Wherefore also it is customary to set the tribe of prophets to pass judgement\nupon these inspired divinations;  and they, indeed, themselves are named diviners by certain who are wholly ignorant of the truth that they are not diviners but interpreters of the mysterious voice and apparition, for whom the most fitting name would be prophets of things divined.For these reasons, then, the nature of the liver is such as we have stated and situated in the region we have described, for the sake of divination.  Moreover, when the individual creature is alive this organ affords signs that are fairly manifest, but when deprived of life it becomes blind and the divinations it presents are too much obscured to have any\nclear significance.The structure of the organ which adjoins it, with its seat on the left, is for the sake of the liver, to keep it always bright and clean, as a wiper that is laid beside a mirror always prepared and ready to hand.  Wherefore also, whenever any impurities due to ailments of the body occur round about the liver, the loose texture of the spleen cleanses and absorbs them all, seeing that it is woven of a stuff that is porous and bloodless:  hence, when it is filled with the offscourings, the spleen grows to be large and festered;\nand conversely, when the body is cleansed, it is reduced and shrinks back to its primal state.Concerning the soul, then, what part of it is mortal, what part immortal, and where and with what companions and for what reasons these have been housed apart, only if God concurred could we dare to affirm that our account is true;  but that our account is probable we must dare to affirm now, and to affirm still more positively as our inquiry proceeds:  affirmed, therefore, let it be.\nThe subject which comes next to this we must investigate on the same lines;  and that subject is the way in which the remainder of the body has been generated. Its construction would most fittingly be ascribed to reasoning such as this.  Those who were constructing our kind were aware of the incontinence that would reside in us in respect of drinks and meats, and how that because of our greed we would consume far more than what was moderate and necessary;  wherefore, lest owing to maladies swift destruction should overtake them,\nand the mortal kind, while still incomplete, come straightway to a complete end,foreseeing this, the Gods set the abdomen, as it is called, to serve as a receptacle for the holding of the superfluous meat and drink;  and round about therein they coiled the structure of the entrails, to prevent the food from passing through quickly and thereby compelling the body to require more food quickly, and causing insatiate appetite, whereby the whole kind by reason of its gluttony would be rendered devoid of philosophy and of culture, and disobedient to the most divine part we possess.As regards the bones and the flesh and all such substances\nthe position was this.  All these had their origin in the generation of the marrow.  For it was in this that the bonds of life by which the Soul is bound to the body were fastened, and implanted the roots of the mortal kind;  but the marrow itself was generated out of other elements.  Taking all these primary triangles which, being unwarped and smooth, were best able to produce with exactness fire and water and air and earth, God separated them, each apart from his own kind,\nand mixing them one with another in due proportion, He fashioned therefrom the marrow, devising it as a universal seed-stuff for every mortal kind.  Next, He engendered therein the various kinds of Soul and bound them down;  and He straightway divided the marrow itself, in His original division, into shapes corresponding in their number and their nature to the number and the nature of the shapes which should belong to the several kinds of Soul.  And that portion of the marrow which was intended to receive within itself, as it were into a field, the divine seed He molded\nin the shape of a perfect globe and bestowed on it the name of brain, purposing that, when each living creature should be completed, the vessel surrounding this should be called the head.  But that portion which was to contain the other and mortal part of the Soul He divided into shapes that were at once rounded and elongated, and all these He designated marrow;  and from these, as from anchors, He cast out bands of the Whole Soul, and around this He finally wrought the whole of this body of ours, when He had first built round about it for a shelter a framework\nall of bone.And bone He compounded in this wise.  Having sifted earth till it was pure and smooth, He kneaded it and moistened it with marrow;  then He placed it in fire, and after that dipped it in water, and from this back to fire, and once again in water;  and by thus transferring it many times from the one element to the other He made it so that it was soluble by neither.  This, then, He used, and fashioned thereof, by turning, a bony sphere round about the brain;  and therein he left a narrow opening;  and around the marrow\nof both neck and back He molded vertebrae of bone, and set them, like pivots, in a vertical row, throughout all the trunk, beginning from the head.  And thus for preserving the whole seed He closed it in with a ring-fence of stony substance;  and therein He made joints, using as an aid the power of the Other as an intermediary between them, for the sake of movement and bending.\nAnd inasmuch as He deemed that the texture of the bony substance was too hard and inflexible, and that if it were fired and cooled again it would decay and speedily destroy the seed within it, for these reasons He contrived the species known as sinew and flesh.  He designed to bind all the limbs together by means of the former, which tightens and relaxes itself around the pivots, and thus cause the body to bend and stretch itself.  And the flesh He designed to be a shield against the heat and a shelter against the cold;  and, moreover, that in case of falls it should yield to the body softly and gently, like padded garments;\nand, inasmuch as it contains within it warm moisture, that it should supply in summer, by its perspiration and dampness, a congenial coolness over the exterior of the whole body, and contrariwise in winter defend the body sufficiently, by means of its fire, from the frost which attacks and surrounds it from without.  Wherefore, with this intent, our Modeller mixed and blended together water and fire and earth, and compounding a ferment of acid and salt\nmixed it in therewith, and thus molded flesh full of sap and soft.  And the substance of the sinews He compounded of a mixture of bone and unfermented flesh, forming a single substance blended of both and intermediate in quality, and he used yellow also for its coloring.  Hence it is that the sinews have acquired a quality that is firmer and more rigid than flesh, but softer and more elastic than bone.  With these, then, God enclosed the bones and marrow, first binding them one to another with the sinews, and then shrouding them all over with flesh.\nAll the bones, then, that possessed most soul He enclosed in least flesh, but the bones which contained least soul with most and most dense flesh;  moreover, at the junctions of the bones, except where reason revealed some necessity for its existence, He made but little flesh to grow, lest by hindering the flexions it should make the bodies unwieldy, because stiff in movement, or else through its size and density, when thickly massed together, it should produce insensitiveness, owing to its rigidity, and thereby cause the intellectual parts to be more forgetful and more obtuse.  Wherefore\nthe thighs and the shins and the region of the loins and the bones of the upper and lower arm, and all our other parts which are jointless, and all those bones which are void of intelligence within, owing to the small quantity of soul in the marrowall these are abundantly supplied with flesh;  but those parts which are intelligent are supplied less abundantlyexcept possibly where He so fashioned the flesh that it can of itself convey sensations, as is the case with the tongue;  but most of these parts He made in the way described above.  For the substance which is generated by necessity and grows up with us\nin no wise admits of quick perception coexisting with dense bone and abundant flesh.  For if these characteristics were willing to consort together, then the structure of the head would have acquired them most of all, and mankind, crowned with a head that was fleshy and sinewy and strong, would have enjoyed a life that was twice (nay, many times) as long as our present life, and healthier, to boot, and more free from pain.  But as it is, when the Constructors of our being were cogitating\nwhether they should make a kind that was more long-lived and worse or more short-lived and better, they agreed that the shorter and superior life should by all means be chosen by all rather than the longer and inferior.  Wherefore they covered the head closely with thin bone, but not with flesh and sinews, since it was also without flexions.  For all these reasons, then, the head that was joined to the body in every man was more perceptive and more intelligent but less strong.It was on these grounds and in this way that God set the sinews at the bottom of the head\nround about the neck and glued them there symmetrically;  and with these He fastened the extremities of the jaws below the substance of the face;  and the rest of the sinews He distributed amongst all the limbs, attaching joint to joint.And those who fashioned the features of our mouth fashioned it with teeth and tongue and lips, even as it is fashioned now,\nfor ends both necessary and most good, contriving it as an entrance with a view to necessary ends, and as an outlet with a view to the ends most good.  For all that enters in and supplies food to the body is necessary;  while the stream of speech which flows out and ministers to intelligence is of all streams the fairest and most good.Moreover, it was not possible to leave the head to consist of bare bone only, because of the excessive variations of temperature in either direction, due to the seasons;  nor yet was it possible to allow it to be shrouded up, and to become, in consequence, stupid and insensitive owing to its burdensome mass of flesh.\nAccordingly, of the fleshy substance which was not being fully dried up a larger enveloping film was separated off, forming what is now called skin. And this, having united with itself because of the moisture round the brain and spreading, formed a vesture round about the head;  and this was damped by the moisture ascending under the seams and closed down over the crown, being drawn together as it were in a knot;  and the seams had all kinds of shapes owing to the force of the soul's revolutions and of her food, being more in number when these are more in conflict with one another, and less when they are less in conflict.\nAnd the Deity kept puncturing all this skin round about with fire;  and when the skin was pierced and the moisture flew out through it, all the liquid and heat that was pure went away, but such as was mixed with the substance whereof the skin also was composed was lifted up by the motion and extended far beyond the skin, being of a fineness to match the puncture;  but since it was thrust back, because of its slowness, by the external air that surrounded it, it coiled itself round inside and rooted itself under the skin.\nSuch, then, were the processes by which hair grew in the skin, it being a cord-like species akin to the skin but harder and denser owing to the constriction of the cold, whereby each hair as it separated off from the skin was chilled and constricted.  Making use, then, of the causes mentioned our Maker fashioned the head shaggy with hair, purposing that, in place of flesh, the hair should serve as a light roofing for the part about the brain for safety's sake,\nproviding a sufficient shade and screen alike in summer and in winter, while proving no obstacle in the way of easy perception.And at the place in the fingers where sinew and skin and bone were interlaced there was formed a material blended of these three;  and this when it was dried off became a single hard skin compounded of them all and whereas these were the auxiliary causes whereby it was fashioned, it was wrought by the greatest of causes, divine Purpose, for the sake of what should come to pass hereafter.  For those who were constructing us knew that out of men women should one day spring\nand all other animals; and they understood, moreover, that many of these creatures would need for many purposes the help of nails;  wherefore they impressed upon men at their very birth the rudimentary structure of finger-nails.  Upon this account and with these designs they caused skin to grow into hair and nails upon the extremities of the limbs.And when all the limbs and parts of the mortal living creature had been naturally joined together,\nit was so that of necessity its life consisted in fire and air;  and because of this it wasted away when dissolved by these elements or left empty thereby;  wherefore the Gods contrived succour for the creature.  Blending it with other shapes and senses they engendered a substance akin to that of man, so as to form another living creature:  such are the cultivated trees and plants and seeds which have been trained by husbandry and are now domesticated amongst us;  but formerly the wild kinds only existed,\nthese being older than the cultivated kinds.  For everything, in fact, which partakes of life may justly and with perfect truth be termed a living creature.  Certainly that creature which we are now describing partakes of the third kind of soul, which is seated, as we affirm, between the midriff and the navel, and which shares not at all in opinion and reasoning and mind but in sensation, pleasant and painful, together with desires.  For inasmuch as it continues wholly passive and does not turn within itself around itself, repelling motion from without\nand using its own native motion, it is not endowed by its original constitution with a natural capacity for discerning or reflecting upon any of its own experiences.  Wherefore it lives indeed and is not other than a living creature, but it remains stationary and rooted down owing to its being deprived of the power of self-movement.And when our Superiors had generated all these kinds as nutriment for us inferior beings, they channelled out our body itself, like as if they were cutting channels in gardens, to the end that it might be irrigated as it were by an inflowing stream.  And firstly, beneath the junction\nof the skin and flesh they cut for hidden channels two veins along the back, seeing that the body was in fact double, with right side and left;  and these they drew down along by the spine, keeping between them the spermatic marrow, in order that this might thrive as much as possible, and that the stream of moisture from there, being in a downward course, might flow easily to the other parts and cause the irrigation to be uniform.  After this\nthey clave the veins round the head and interlaced them, and drew them opposite ways, bending those from the right of the head to the left and those from the left to the right, in order that they, together with the skin, might serve as a bond between the head and the body, seeing that the head was not encircled by sinews at the crown;  and in order, also, that the sense-impressions derived from the parts on either side might be manifest to the whole body.\nThereupon they arranged the irrigation on some such plan as thisa plan which we shall perceive more easily when we have first agreed upon the following postulates.  All bodies composed of smaller particles shut in the larger, but those composed of larger particles cannot shut in the smaller;  and fire, because of all the elements it has the smallest particles, passes through water and earth and air and all things composed thereof, and nothing can shut it in.  We must conceive that the same law holds good of the action of our belly.  Whenever foods and drinks flow into it\nit shuts them in, but air and fire, being of smaller particles than its own structure, it cannot shut in.  These elements, therefore, God employed to provide irrigation from the belly to the veins, weaving out of air and fire a veil of mesh-work like unto a fish-weel, having two innerweels at its entrance;  and one of these inner-weels He wove over again so as to make it bifurcated;  and from the inner-weels He stretched as it were ropes all over it in a circle up to the extremities of the veil. Now the inward parts of the veil\nHe constructed wholly of fire, but the inner-weels and the envelope of air;  and taking this He placed it round about the living creature that was molded in the following manner.  The part consisting of the inner-weels He let down into the mouth;  and since this part was twofold, He let down one inner-weel by way of the windpipe into the lungs, and the other into the belly alongside the windpipe.  And cleaving the former of these weels in two He gave to both sections a common outlet by way of the channels of the nose, so that when the first conduit by way of the mouth failed to act,\nits streams as well should be plenished from this.  The rest of the enveloping mesh-work He made to grow round all the hollow part of our body;  and He caused all this at one time to flow gently into the inner-weels, seeing they were of air, and at another time the weels to flow back into it.  And inasmuch as the body was porous, He caused the veil to pass in through it and out again;  and the inner rays of fire that were enclosed within it He made to follow the air as it moved in either direction;  whence it comes that, so long as the mortal living creature preserves its structure, this process goes on unceasingly.\nAnd to this kind of process the Giver of Titles gave, as we say, the names of inspiration and expiration.  And the whole of this mechanism and its effects have been created in order to secure nourishment and life for our body, by means of moistening and cooling.  For as the respiration goes in and out the inward fire attached thereto follows it;  and whenever in its constant oscillations this fire enters in through the belly\nand lays hold on the meats and drinks, it dissolves them, and dividing them into small particles it disperses them through the outlets by which it passes and draws them off to the veins, like water drawn into channels from a spring;  and thus it causes the streams of the veins to flow through the body as through a pipe.Once again let us consider the process of respiration, and the causes in virtue of which it has come to be such as it now is.\nThis, then, is the way of it.  Inasmuch as no void exists into which any of the moving bodies could enter, while the breath from us moves outwards, what follows is plain to everyone namely, that the breath does not enter a void but pushes the adjacent body from its seat;  and the body thus displaced drives out in turn the next;  and by this law of necessity every such body is driven round towards the seat from which the breath went out and enters therein, filling it up and following the breath;  and all this takes place as one simultaneous process, like a revolving wheel, because that no void exists.\nWherefore the region of the chest and that of the lungs when they let out the breath become filled again by the air surrounding the body, which filters in through the porous flesh and circulates round.  And again, when the air is repelled and passes out through the body it pushes the inspired air round and in by way of the passages of the mouth and of the nostrils.  The originating cause\nof these processes we must assume to be this.  Every living creature has its inward parts round the blood and the veins extremely hot, as it were a fount of fire residing within it;  and this region we have, in fact, likened to the envelope of the fish-weel, saying that all that was extended at its middle was woven of fire, whereas all the other and outward parts were of air.  Now we must agree that heat, by Nature's law, goes out into its own region to its kindred substance;  and inasmuch as there are two outlets, the one out by way of the body,\nthe other by way of the mouth and the nose, whenever the fire rushes in one direction it propels the air round to the other, and the air which is thus propelled round becomes heated by streaming into the fire, whereas the air which passes out becomes cooled.  And as the heat changes its situation and the particles about the other outlet become hotter, the hotter body in its turn tends in that direction, and moving towards its own substance propels round the air which is at the former outlet;  and thus the air, by continually undergoing and transmitting the same affections, causes inspiration and expiration to come about as a result of this double process, as it were a wheel that oscillates backwards and forwards.Moreover, we must trace out in this way the causes of the phenomena connected with medical cupping-glasses,\nand the causes of deglutition, and of projectiles, whether discharged aloft or flying over the surface of the earth;  and the causes also of all the sounds which because of their quickness or slowness seem shrill or deep, and the movement of which is at one time discordant because of the irregularity of the motion they cause within us, and at another time concordant because of its regularity.  For the slower sounds overtake the motions of the earlier and quicker sounds when the latter begin to stop\nand have already fallen to a speed similar to that with which the slower sounds collide with them afterwards and move them;  and when the slower overtake the quicker sounds they do not perturb them by imposing upon them a different motion, but they attach to them the beginning of a slower motion in accord with that which was quicker but is tending to cease;  and thus from shrill and deep they blend one single sensation, furnishing pleasure thereby to the unintelligent, and to the intelligent that intellectual delight which is caused by the imitation of the divine harmony manifested in mortal motions.Furthermore, as regards all flowings of waters, and fallings\nof thunderbolts, and the marvels concerning the attraction of electron and of the Heraclean stonenot one of all these ever possesses any real power of attraction;  but the fact that there is no void, and that these bodies propel themselves round one into another, and that according as they separate or unite they all exchange places and proceed severally each to its own region,it is by means of these complex and reciprocal processes that such marvels are wrought, as will be evident to him who investigates them properly.\nMoreover, the process of respirationwith which our account commencedcame about, as we previously stated, in this manner and by these means.  The fire divides the foods, and rises through the body following after the breath;  and as it rises, with the breath it fills the veins from the belly by drawing into them from thence the divided particles.  And it is owing to this that in all living creatures the streams of nutriment course in this way through the whole body.  And inasmuch as these nutritive particles are freshly divided\nand derived from kindred substances,some from fruits, and some from cereals, which God planted for us for the express purpose of serving as food,they get all varieties of colors because of their commingling, but red is the color that runs through them most of all, it being a natural product of the action of the fire in dividing the liquid food and imprinting itself thereon. Wherefore the color of the stream which flows through the body acquired an appearance such as we have described;  and this stream we call blood, which is the nutriment of the flesh\nand of the whole body, each part drawing therefrom supplies of fluid and filling up the room of the evacuated matter.  And the processes of filling and evacuating take place just as the motion of everything in the Universe takes place, namely, according to the law that every kindred substance moves towards its kind.  For the bodies which surround us without are always dissolving us and sending off and distributing to each species of substance what is akin thereto;  while the blood-particles, again, being minced up within us and surrounded by the structure of each creature as by a Heaven, are compelled to copy the motion of the whole;\nhence, when each of the particles that are divided up inside moves towards its kin, it fills up again the emptied place.  And when what passes out is more than the inflow every creature decays, but when less, it increases.  Now when the structure of the whole creature is new, inasmuch as the triangles which form its elements are still fresh, and as it were straight from the stocks, it keeps them firmly interlocked one with another, and the whole mass of it is of a soft composition,\nseeing that it is newly produced from marrow and nourished on milk;  and as the triangles contained therein, which have invaded it from without and go to form the meats and drinks, are older and weaker than its own, it divides and overcomes them with its own new triangles, and thus renders the creature large by feeding it on many similar substances.  But when the root of the triangles grows slack owing to their having fought many fights during long periods,\nthey are no longer able to divide the entering triangles of the food and assimilate them to themselves, but are themselves easily divided by those which enter from without;  and in this condition every animal is overpowered and decays; and this process is named old age.  And finally, when the bonds of the triangles in the marrow which have been fitly framed together no longer resist the strain but fall asunder, they let slip in turn the bonds of the soul, and it, when thus naturally set loose, flies out gladly;\nfor whereas every process which is contrary to nature is painful, that which takes place naturally is pleasurable.  So too, in like manner, the death which occurs in consequence of disease or by wounds is painful and violent, but that which follows on old age and constitutes a natural end is the least grievous of deaths and is accompanied by more of pleasure than of pain.The origin of disease is plain, of course, to everybody.\nFor seeing that there are four elements of which the body is compacted,earth, fire, water and air,when, contrary to nature, there occurs either an excess or a deficiency of these elements, or a transference thereof from their native region to an alien region;  or again, seeing that fire and the rest have each more than one variety, every time that the body admits an inappropriate variety, then these and all similar occurrences bring about internal disorders and disease.  For when any one element suffers a change of condition that is contrary to nature, all its particles that formerly were being cooled\nbecome heated, and the dry presently become moist, and the light heavy, and they undergo every variety of change in every respect.  For, as we maintain, it is only the addition or subtraction of the same substance from the same substance in the same order and in the same manner and in due proportion which will allow the latter to remain safe and sound in its sameness with itself.  But whatsoever oversteps any of these conditions in its going out or its coming in will produce alterations of every variety and countless diseases and corruptions.\nAgain, in the structures which are naturally secondary in order of construction, there is a second class of diseases to be noted by him who has a mind to take cognizance of them.  For inasmuch as marrow and bone and flesh and sinew are compacted from the elements,and blood also is formed from the same constituents, although in a different way, most of the other maladies come about like those previously described, but the most severe of them have dangerous results for the reason following:  whenever the production of these secondary substances proceeds in the reverse direction, then they are corrupted.  For in the order of nature flesh and sinews arise from blood,\nthe sinew from the fibrine because of its kindred quality, and flesh from the coagulated substance which coagulates on its separation from the fibrine;  and further, the substance which is derived from the sinews and flesh, being viscid and oily, not only glues the flesh to the substance of the bones but also feeds and increases the bone itself which encloses the marrow, while that which is formed of the purest kind of triangles, very smooth and very oily, filters through\nthe density of the bones, and, as it oozes and drips from the bones, moistens the marrow.  Now when each of these substances is produced in this order, health as a rule results;  but if in the reverse order, disease.  For whenever the flesh is decomposed and sends its decomposed matter back again into the veins, then, uniting with the air, the blood in the veins, which is large in volume and of every variety, is diversified by colors and bitter flavors, as well as by sharp and saline properties, and contains bile and serum and phlegm of every sort.  For when all the substances become reversed and corrupted, they begin by destroying the blood itself, and then they themselves cease to supply\nany nourishment to the body;  for they move through the veins in all directions and no longer preserve the order of their natural revolutions, being at enmity with themselves because they have no enjoyment of themselves, and being at war also with the established and regular constitution of the body, which they corrupt and dissolve.  Therefore all the oldest part of the flesh that is decomposed becomes tough and is blackened by the continued combustion;  and because it is eaten away on every side it is bitter, and therefore dangerous\nin its attack on any part of the body that is not as yet corrupted.  And at one time the black matter acquires a sharpness in place of its bitterness, when the bitter substance becomes more diluted;  and at another time the bitter substance acquires a redder color through being dipped in blood, while if the black matter is blended with this it turns greenish;  and again, whenever new flesh also is decomposed by the fire of the inflammation, a yellow matter is commingled with the bitter substance.\nTo all these humors the general designation bile has been given, either by certain physicians or by someone who was capable of surveying a number of dissimilar cases and discerning amongst them one single type worthy to give its name to them all.  All the rest that are counted as species of bile have gained their special descriptions in each case from their colors.Serum is of two kinds:  one is the mild whey of the blood;  the other, being derived from black and acid bile, is malignant whenever it is imbued with a saline quality through the action of heat;  and this kind is termed acid phlegm.  Another kind involves air and is produced by dissolution from new and tender flesh.  And when this is inflated\nand enclosed by a fluid, and when as a result of this process bubbles are formed which individually are invisible because of their small size but in the aggregate form a mass which is visible, and which possess a color which appears white owing to the foam created,then we describe all this decomposition of tender flesh intermixed with air as white phlegm.And the whey of phlegm that is newly formed is sweat and tears,\nand all other such humors as pour forth in the daily purgings of the body.  And all these are factors in disease, whenever the blood is not replenished naturally from meats and drinks but receives its mass from opposite substances contrary to Nature's laws.Now, when the flesh in any part is being decomposed by disease, but the bases thereof still remain firm, the force of the attack is reduced by half, for it still admits of easy recovery;\nbut whenever the substance which binds the flesh to the bones becomes diseased and no longer separates itself at once from them and from the sinews, so as to provide food for the bone and to serve as a bond between flesh and bone, but becomes rough and saline instead of being oily and smooth and viscid, owing to its being starved by a bad regimen,then, every such substance, as it undergoes these affections, molders away beneath the flesh and the sinews\nand withdraws from the bones;  while the flesh falls away with it from the roots and leaves the sinews bare and full of saline matter, and by falling back itself into the stream of the blood it augments the maladies previously described.But although these bodily ailments are severe, still more grave are those which precede them, whenever the bone by reason of the density of the flesh fails to receive sufficient inspiration, and becoming heated because of its moldiness decays and does not admit its nutriment, but, on the contrary, falls back itself,\nas it crumbles, into its nutriment which then passes into flesh, and this flesh falling into, the blood causes all such maladies to be more violent than those previously described.  And the most extreme case of all occurs whenever the substance of the marrow becomes diseased either from deficiency or from excess;  for this results in the gravest of diseases and the most potent in causing death, inasmuch as the whole substance of the body, by the force of necessity, streams in the reverse direction.A third class of diseases takes place, as we must conceive, in three ways,\nbeing due partly to air, partly to phlegm, and partly to bile.  Whenever the lungs, which are the dispensers of air to the body, fail to keep their outlets clean through being blocked up with rheums, then the air, being unable to pass one way while entering by another way in more than its proper volume, causes the parts deprived of respiration to rot, but forces and distorts the vessels of the veins, and as it thus dissolves the body it is itself shut off within the center thereof which contains the midriff;  and as a result of this\ncountless diseases of a painful kind are produced, accompanied by much sweating.  And often, when the flesh is disintegrated, air which is enclosed in the body and is unable to pass out brings about the same pangs as those caused by the air that enters from without;  and these pangs are most severe when the air surrounds the sinews and the adjacent veins and by its swelling up strains backwards the tendons and the sinews attached to them;  hence it is actually from this process of intense strain that these maladies have derived their names of tetanus and opisthotonus.  Of these maladies the cure also is severe for what does most to relieve them is, in fact, an attack of fever.\nWhite phlegm, also, is dangerous when it is blocked inside because of the air in its bubbles;  but when it has air-vents outside the body it is milder, although it marks the body with spots by breeding white scabs and tetters and the maladies akin thereto.  And when this phlegm is blended with black bile and spreads over the revolutions of the head, which are the most divine, and perturbs them,\nits action is more gentle during sleep, but when it attacks persons who are awake it is harder to shake off;  and because it is a disease of the sacred substance it is most justly termed the sacred disease. Phlegm that is sharp and saline is the fount of all the maladies which are of the nature of catarrhs;  and these have received all kinds of names because the regions into which they flow are of all varieties.All those diseases which are called inflammations, owing to the burning and inflaming of the body which they involve, are caused by bile.  This, when it gains an external outlet,\nboils and sends up all kinds of eruptions;  but when it is confined inside it produces many burning diseases;  and of these the gravest occurs when the bile, being mixed with pure blood, displaces the matter of the fibrine from its proper position.  For this fibrine is dispersed through the blood in order that the blood may have a due proportion of both rarity and density, and may neither flow out from the porous body through being liquefied by heat, nor yet prove immobile\nthrough its density and circulate with difficulty in the veins.  Of these qualities the fibrine preserves the due amount owing to the nature of its formation. Even when anyone collects together the fibrine of blood that is dead and in process of cooling, all the rest of the blood turns liquid;  but if the fibrine is left alone as it is, it acts in combination with the surrounding cold and rapidly congeals the blood.  As the fibrine, then, has this property, bile, which is naturally formed of old blood and dissolved again into blood from flesh, penetrates the blood gradually at first, while it is hot and moist,\nand is congealed by this property of the fibrine;  and as it becomes congealed and forcibly chilled it causes internal cold and shivering.  But when the bile flows in with more volume, it overpowers the fibrine by the heat it contains, and shakes it into disorder by its boiling up;  and should it be capable of thus overpowering the fibrine continuously, it penetrates to the substance of the marrow and loosens from thence, by burning, the mooring-ropes of the soul, as it were of a ship, and sets it free.  But when the bile is in smaller quantity and the body resists dissolution, then the bile itself is overpowered, and either it is ejected over the whole surface of the body, or else it is forced through the veins into the lower or the upper belly, being ejected from the body like fugitives from a city in revolt;\nand it produces diarrhoea and dysentery and all suchlike maladies.When a body has become diseased mainly from an excess of fire, it produces constant inflammations and fevers;  when from air, quotidian fevers;  when from water, tertian fevers, because that element is more sluggish than air or fire;  and when from earth, which is the fourth and most sluggish of the elements and is purged in four-fold periods of time, it causes quartan fevers and is cured with difficulty.\nSuch is the manner in which diseases of the body come about;  and those of the soul which are due to the condition of the body arise in the following way.  We must agree that folly is a disease of the soul;  and of folly there are two kinds, the one of which is madness, the other ignorance.  Whatever affection a man suffers from, if it involves either of these conditions it must be termed disease;   and we must maintain that pleasures and pains in excess are the greatest of the soul's diseases.  For when a man is overjoyed or contrariwise suffering excessively\nfrom pain, being in haste to seize on the one and avoid the other beyond measure, he is unable either to see or to hear anything correctly, and he is at such a time distraught and wholly incapable of exercising reason.  And whenever a man's seed grows to abundant volume in his marrow, as it were a tree that is overladen beyond measure with fruit, he brings on himself time after time many pangs and many pleasures owing to his desires and the issue thereof, and comes to be in a state of madness\nfor the most part of his life because of those greatest of pleasures and pains, and keeps his soul diseased and senseless by reason of the action of his body.  Yet such a man is reputed to be voluntarily wicked and not diseased;  although, in truth, this sexual incontinence, which is due for the most part to the abundance and fluidity of one substance because of the porosity of the bones, constitutes a disease of the soul.  And indeed almost all those affections which are called by way of reproach incontinence in pleasure, as though the wicked acted voluntarily, are wrongly so reproached;  for no one is voluntarily wicked,\nbut the wicked man becomes wicked by reason of some evil condition of body and unskilled nurture, and these are experiences which are hateful to everyone and involuntary.  And again, in respect of pains likewise the soul acquires much evil because of the body.For whenever the humors which arise from acid and saline phlegms, and all humors that are bitter and bilious wander through the body and find no external vent\nbut are confined within, and mingle their vapor with the movement of the soul and are blended therewith, they implant diseases of the soul of all kinds, varying in intensity and in extent;  and as these humors penetrate to the three regions of the Soul, according to the region which they severally attack, they give rise to all varieties of bad temper and bad spirits, and they give rise to all manner of rashness and cowardice, and of forgetfulness also, as well as of stupidity.  Furthermore, when, with men in such an evil condition,\nthe political administration also is evil, and the speech in the cities, both public and private, is evil;  and when, moreover, no lessons that would cure these evils are anywhere learnt from childhood,thus it comes to pass that all of us who are wicked become wicked owing to two quite involuntary causes.  And for these we must always blame the begetters more than the begotten, and the nurses more than the nurslings;  yet each man must endeavor, as best he can, by means of nurture and by his pursuits and studies to flee the evil and to pursue the good.  This, however, forms a separate subject of discussion.\nAgain, it is reasonable and proper to set forth in turn the subject complementary to the foregoing, namely the remedial treatment of body and mind, and the causes which conserve this.  For what is good merits description more than what is evil.  All that is good is fair, and the fair is not void of due measure;  wherefore also the living creature that is to be fair must be symmetrical.  Of symmetries we distinguish and reason about such as are small, but of the most important and the greatest we have no rational comprehension.  For with respect to health and disease,\nvirtue and vice, there is no symmetry or want of symmetry greater than that which exists between the soul itself and the body itself.  But as regards these, we wholly fail to perceive or reflect that, whenever a weaker and inferior type of body is the vehicle of a soul that is strong and in all ways great,or conversely, when each of these two is of the opposite kind,then the creature as a whole is not fair, seeing that it is unsymmetrical in respect of the greatest of symmetries;  whereas a creature in the opposite condition is of all sights, for him who has eyes to see,\nthe fairest and most admirable.  A body, for example, which is too long in the legs, or otherwise disproportioned owing to some excess, is not only ugly, but, when joint effort is required, it is also the source of much fatigue and many sprains and falls by reason of its clumsy motion, whereby it causes itself countless evils.  So likewise we must conceive of that compound of soul and body which we call the living creature.  Whenever the soul within it is stronger than the body\nand is in a very passionate state, it shakes up the whole body from within and fills it with maladies;  and whenever the soul ardently pursues some study or investigation, it wastes the body;  and again, when the soul engages, in public or in private, in teachings and battles of words carried on with controversy and contention, it makes the body inflamed and shakes it to pieces, and induces catarrhs;  and thereby it deceives the majority of so-called physicians and makes them ascribe the malady to the wrong cause.And, on the other hand, when a large and overbearing body is united to a small\nand weak intellect, inasmuch as two desires naturally exist amongst men, the desire of food for the body's sake, and the desire of wisdom for the sake of the most divine part we have,the motions of the stronger part prevail and augment their own power, but they make that of the soul obtuse and dull of wit and forgetful, and thereby they produce within it that greatest of diseases, ignorance.From both these evils the one means of salvation is thisneither to exercise the soul without the body nor the body without the soul, so that they may be evenly matched and sound of health.  Thus the student of mathematics,\nor of any other subject, who works very hard with his intellect must also provide his body with exercise by practising gymnastics;  while he who is diligent in molding his body must, in turn, provide his soul with motion by cultivating music and philosophy in general, if either is to deserve to be called truly both fair and good.The various parts, likewise, must be treated in the same manner, in imitation of the form of the Universe.  For as the body\nis inflamed or chilled within by the particles that enter it, and again is dried or moistened by those without, and suffers the affections consequent on both these motions, whenever a man delivers his body, in a state of rest, to these motions, it is overpowered and utterly perishes;  whereas if a man imitates that which we have called the nurturer and nurse of the Universe, and never, if possible, allows the body to be at rest but keeps it moving, and by continually producing internal vibrations defends it in nature's way against the inward and outward motions, and by means of moderate vibrations\narranges the affections and particles which stray about in the body in their due reciprocal order, according to their affinities,as described in the previous account which we have given of the Universethen he will not suffer foe set beside foe to breed war in the body and disease, but he will cause friend to be set beside friend so as to produce sound health.\nFurther, as concerns the motions, the best motion of a body is that caused by itself in itself;  for this is most nearly akin to the motion of intelligence and the motion of the Universe.  Motion due to the agency of another is less good;  and the least good motion is that which is imparted to a body lying in a state of rest and which moves it piecemeal and by means of others.  Wherefore the motion that is best for purgings and renovations of the body consists in gymnastic exercises;  and second-best is the motion provided by swaying vehicles, such as boats or any conveyances that produce no fatigue;  while the third kind of motion, although useful for one who is absolutely driven to it,\nis by no means acceptable, under any other conditions, to a man of sense, it being the medical kind of purging by means of drugs.  For no diseases which do not involve great danger ought to be irritated by drugging.  For in its structure every disease resembles in some sort the nature of the living creature.  For, in truth, the constitution of these creatures has prescribed periods of life for the species as a whole, and each individual creature likewise has a naturally predestined term of life,\napart from the accidents due to necessity.  For from the very beginning the triangles of each creature are constructed with a capacity for lasting until a certain time, beyond which no one could ever continue to live.  With respect to the structure of diseases also the same rule holds good:  whenever anyone does violence thereto by drugging, in despite of the predestined period of time, diseases many and grave, in place of few and slight, are wont to occur.  Wherefore one ought to control all such diseases, so far as\none has the time to spare, by means of dieting rather than irritate a fractious evil by drugging.Concerning both the composite living creature and the bodily part of it, how a man should both guide and be guided by himself so as to live a most rational life, let our statement stand thus.  But first and with special care we must make ready the part which is to be the guide to the best of our power, so that it may be as fair and good as possible for the work of guidance.  Now to expound this subject alone in accurate detail would in itself be\na sufficient task. But treating it merely as a side-issue, if we follow on the lines of our previous exposition, we may consider the matter and state our conclusions not inaptly in the following terms.  We have frequently asserted that there are housed within us in three regions three kinds of soul, and that each of these has its own motions; so now likewise we must repeat, as briefly as possible, that the kind which remains in idleness and stays with its own motions;  in repose necessarily becomes weakest, whereas the kind which exercises itself becomes strongest;\nwherefore care must be taken that they have their motions relatively to one another in due proportion.  And as regards the most lordly kind of our soul, we must conceive of it in this wise:  we declare that God has given to each of us, as his daemon, that kind of soul which is housed in the top of our body and which raises usseeing that we are not an earthly but a heavenly plant up from earth towards our kindred in the heaven.  And herein we speak most truly;  for it is by suspending our head and root from that region whence the substance of our soul first came that the Divine Power\nkeeps upright our whole body.Whoso, then, indulges in lusts or in contentions and devotes himself overmuch thereto must of necessity be filled with opinions that are wholly mortal, and altogether, so far as it is possible to become mortal, fall not short of this in even a small degree, inasmuch as he has made great his mortal part.  But he who has seriously devoted himself to learning and to true thoughts, and has exercised these qualities above all his others,\nmust necessarily and inevitably think thoughts that are immortal and divine, if so be that he lays hold on truth, and in so far as it is possible for human nature to partake of immortality, he must fall short thereof in no degree;  and inasmuch as he is for ever tending his divine part and duly magnifying that daemon who dwells along with him, he must be supremely blessed. And the way of tendance of every part by every man is onenamely, to supply each with its own congenial food and motion;  and for the divine part within us the congenial motions\nare the intellections and revolutions of the Universe. These each one of us should follow, rectifying the revolutions within our head, which were distorted at our birth, by learning the harmonies and revolutions of the Universe, and thereby making the part that thinks like unto the object of its thought, in accordance with its original nature, and having achieved this likeness attain finally to that goal of life which is set before men by the gods as the most good both for the present and for the time to come.\nAnd now the task prescribed for us at the beginning to give a description of the Universe up to the production of mankind, would appear to be wellnigh completed.  For as regards the mode in which the rest of living creatures have been produced we must make but a brief statement, seeing that there is no need to speak at length;  for by such brevity we will feel ourselves to be preserving a right proportion in our handling of these subjects.  Wherefore let this matter be treated as follows.According to the probable account, all those creatures generated as men who proved themselves cowardly and spent their lives in wrong-doing were transformed,\nat their second incarnation, into women.  And it was for this reason that the gods at that time contrived the love of sexual intercourse by constructing an animate creature of one kind in us men, and of another kind in women;  and they made these severally in the following fashion.  From the passage of egress for the drink, where it receives and joins in discharging the fluid which has come through the lungs beneath the kidneys into the bladder and has been compressed by the air, they bored a hole into the condensed marrow which comes from the head down by the neck and along the spine\nwhich marrow, in our previous account, we termed seed.  And the marrow, inasmuch as it is animate and has been granted an outlet, has endowed the part where its outlet lies with a love for generating by implanting therein a lively desire for emission.  Wherefore in men the nature of the genital organs is disobedient and self-willed, like a creature that is deaf to reason, and it attempts to dominate all because of its frenzied lusts.\nAnd in women again, owing to the same causes, whenever the matrix or womb, as it is called,which is an indwelling creature desirous of child-bearing,remains without fruit long beyond the due season, it is vexed and takes it ill;  and by straying all ways through the body and blocking up the passages of the breath and preventing respiration it casts the body into the uttermost distress, and causes, moreover, all kinds of maladies;  until the desire and love of the two sexes unite them.  Then, culling as it were the fruit from trees,\nthey sow upon the womb, as upon ploughed soil, animalcules that are invisible for smallness and unshapen;  and these, again, they mold into shape and nourish to a great size within the body;  after which they bring them forth into the light and thus complete the generation of the living creature.In this fashion, then, women and the whole female sex have come into existence.And the tribe of birds are derived by transformation, growing feathers in place of hair, from men who are harmless but light-mindedmen, too, who, being students of the worlds above, suppose in their simplicity that the most solid proofs about such matters are obtained by the sense of sight.\nAnd the wild species of animal that goes on foot is derived from those men who have paid no attention at all to philosophy nor studied at all the nature of the heavens, because they ceased to make use of the revolutions within the head and followed the lead of those parts of the soul which are in the breast. Owing to these practices they have dragged their front limbs and their head down to the earth, and there planted them, because of their kinship therewith;  and they have acquired elongated heads of every shape, according as their several revolutions have been distorted by disuse.\nOn this account also their race was made four-footed and many-footed, since God set more supports under the more foolish ones, so that they might be dragged down still more to the earth.  And inasmuch as there was no longer any need of feet for the most foolish of these same creatures, which stretched with their whole body along the earth, the gods generated these footless and wriggling upon the earth.\nAnd the fourth kind, which lives in the water, came from the most utterly thoughtless and stupid of men, whom those that remolded them deemed no longer worthy even of pure respiration, seeing that they were unclean of soul through utter wickedness;  wherefore in place of air, for refined and pure respiring, they thrust them into water, there to respire its turbid depths.  Thence have come into being the tribe of fishes and of shellfish and all creatures of the waters, which have for their portion the extremest of all abodes in requital for the extremity of their witlessness.  Thus, both then and now, living creatures keep passing\ninto one another in all these ways, as they undergo transformation by the loss or by the gain of reason and unreason.And now at length we may say that our discourse concerning the Universe has reached its termination.  For this our Cosmos has received the living creatures both mortal and immortal and been thereby fulfilled;  it being itself a visible Living Creature embracing the visible creatures, a perceptible God made in the image of the Intelligible, most great and good and fair and perfect in its generationeven this one Heaven sole of its kind."}}]}}, {"@n": "Criti.", "body": {"head": "Critias", "castList": {"castItem": [{"@type": "role", "role": "Timaeus"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Critias"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Socrates"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Hermocrates"}]}, "milestone": [{"@unit": "page", "@n": "106"}, {"@n": "106a", "@unit": "section"}], "sp": [{"speaker": "Timaeus", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "Loeb", "title": "Tim", "#text": "i.e., the Universe, cf.. 92 c, 27 c."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "Loeb", "title": "Tim", "#text": "See . 27 A, B."}], "milestone": {"@n": "106b", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "How gladly do I now welcome my release, Socrates, from my protracted discourse, even as a traveller who takes his rest after a long journey!

I am sufficiently aware that the request I am about to make is decidedly presumptuous and less civil than is proper, but none the less it must be uttered.  For as regards the exposition you gave, what man in his senses would attempt to deny its excellence?  But what I must somehow endeavor to show is that the discourse now to be delivered calls for greater indulgence because of its greater difficulty.  For it is easier, Timaeus, to appear to speak satisfactorily to men about the gods,\nthan to us about mortals.  For when the listeners are in a state of inexperience and complete ignorance about a matter, such a state of mind affords great opportunities to the person who is going to discourse on that matter;  and we know what our state is concerning knowledge of the gods. But in order that I may explain my meaning more clearly, pray follow me further.  The accounts given by us all must be, of course, of the nature of imitations and representations;  and if we look at the portraiture of divine and of human bodies as executed by painters,\nin respect of the ease or difficulty with which they succeed in imitating their subjects in the opinion of onlookers, we shall notice in the first place that as regards the earth and mountains and rivers and woods and the whole of heaven, with the things that exist and move therein, we are content if a man is able to represent them with even a small degree of likeness;  and further, that, inasmuch as we have no exact knowledge about such objects, we do not examine closely or criticize the paintings, but tolerate, in such cases, an inexact\nand deceptive sketch.  On the other hand, whenever a painter tries to render a likeness of our own bodies, we quickly perceive what is defective because of our constant familiar acquaintance with them, and become severe critics of him who fails to bring out to the full all the points of similarity.  And precisely the same thing happens, as we should notice, in the case of discourses:  in respect of what is celestial and divine we are satisfied if the account pocesses even a small degree of likelihood, but we examine with precision\nwhat is mortal and human.  To an account given now on the spur of the moment indulgence must be granted, should we fail to make it a wholly fitting representation;  for one must conceive of mortal objects as being difficult, and not easy, to represent satisfactorily.  It is because I wish to remind you of these facts,\nand crave a greater rather than a less measure of indulgence for what I am about to say, that I have made all these observations, Socrates.  If, therefore, I seem justified in craving this boon, pray grant it willingly."}}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": {"milestone": {"@n": "108b", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "And why should we hesitate to grant it, Critias?

But experience of our task will of itself speedily enlighten you as to its character.  However, I must trust to your consolation\nand encouragement, and in addition to  the gods you mentioned I must call upon all the rest and especially upon Mnemosyne. For practically all the most important part of our speech depends upon this goddess;  for if I can sufficiently remember and report the tale once told by the priests and brought hither by Solon, I am wellnigh convinced that I shall appear to the present audience to have fulfilled my task adequately.  This, then, I must at once proceed to do, and procrastinate no longer.\n Now first of all we must recall the fact that 9000 is the sum of years since the war occurred, as is recorded, between the dwellers beyond the pillars of Heracles and all that dwelt within them;  which war we have now to relate in detail.  It was stated that this city of ours was in command of the one side and fought through the whole of the war, and in command of the other side were the kings of the island of , which we said was an island larger than  and  once upon a time, but now lies sunk by earthquakes and has created a barrier of impassable mud\nwhich prevents those who are sailing out from here to the ocean beyond from proceeding further. Now as regards the numerous barbaric tribes and all the Hellenic nations that then existed, the sequel of our story, when it is, as it were, unrolled, will disclose what happened in each locality;  but the facts about the Athenians of that age and the enemies with whom they fought we must necessarily describe first, at the outset,the military power, that is to say, of each and their forms of government.  And of these two we must give the priority in our account to the state of .\n Once upon a time the gods were taking over by lot the whole earth according to its regions,not according to the results of strife:  for it would not be reasonable to suppose that the gods were ignorant of their own several rights, nor yet that they attempted to obtain for themselves by means of strife a possession to which others, as they knew, had a better claim.  So by just allotments they received each one his own, and they settled their countries;  and when they had thus settled them, they reared us up, even as herdsmen\nrear their flocks, to be their cattle and nurslings;  only it was not our bodies that they constrained by bodily force, like shepherds guiding their flocks with stroke of staff, but they directed from the stern where the living creature is easiest to turn about, laying hold on the soul by persuasion, as by a rudder, according to their own disposition;  and thus they drove and steered all the mortal kind.  Now in other regions others of the gods had their allotments and ordered the affairs, but inasmuch as Hephaestus and Athena were of a like nature, being born of the same father, and agreeing, moreover, in their love of wisdom and of craftsmanship, they both took for their joint portion this land of ours as being naturally congenial and adapted for virtue\nand for wisdom, and therein they planted as native to the soil men of virtue and ordained to their mind the mode of government.  And of these citizens the names are preserved, but their works have vanished owing to the repeated destruction of their successors and the length of the intervening periods.  For, as was said before, the stock that survived on each occasion was a remnant of unlettered mountaineers which had heard the names only of the rulers, and but little besides of their works.  So though they gladly passed on these names\nto their descendants, concerning the mighty deeds and the laws of their predecessors they had no knowledge, save for some invariably obscure reports;  and since, moreover, they and their children for many generations were themselves in want of the necessaries of life, their attention was given to their own needs\nand all their talk was about them;  and in consequence they paid no regard to the happenings of bygone ages.  For legendary lore and the investigation of antiquity are visitants that come to cities in company with leisure, when they see that men are already furnished with the necessaries of life, and not before.In this way, then, the names of the ancients, without their works, have been preserved.  And for evidence of what I say I point to the statement of Solon, that the Egyptian priests, in describing the war of that period, mentioned most of those namessuch as those of Cecrops and Erechtheus and Erichthonius and Erysichthon and most of the other names\nwhich are recorded of the various heroes before Theseusand in like manner also the names of the women.  Moreover, the habit and figure of the goddess indicate that in the case of all animals,\nmale and female, that herd together, every species is naturally capable of practising as a whole and in common its own proper excellence.Now at that time there dwelt in this country not only the other classes of the citizens who were occupied in the handicrafts and in the raising of food from the soil, but also the military class, which had been separated off at the commencement by divine heroes and dwelt apart. It was supplied with all that was required for its sustenance and training, and none of its members possessed any private property, but they regarded all they had\nas the common property of all;  and from the rest of the citizens they claimed to receive nothing beyond a sufficiency of sustenance;  and they practised all those pursuits which were mentioned yesterday, in the description of our proposed Guardians.  Moreover, what was related about our country was plausible and true, namely, that, in the first place, it had its boundaries at that time marked off by the Isthmus, and on the inland side reaching to the heights of Cithaeron and Parnes;\nand that the boundaries ran down with Oropia on the right, and on the seaward side they shut off the Asopus on the left;  and that all other lands were surpassed by ours in goodness of soil, so that it was actually able at that period to support a large host which was exempt from the labors of husbandry.  And of its goodness a strong proof is this:  what is now left of our soil rivals any other in being all-productive and abundant in crops and rich in pasturage for all kinds of cattle;\nand at that period, in addition to their fine quality it produced these things in vast quantity.  How, then, is this statement plausible, and what residue of the land then existing serves to confirm its truth?  The whole of the land lies like a promontory jutting out from the rest of the continent far into the sea and all the cup of the sea;  round about it is, as it happens, of a great depth.  Consequently, since many great convulsions took place during the 9000 yearsfor such was the number of years\nfrom that time to thisthe soil which has kept breaking away from the high lands during these ages and these disasters, forms no pile of sediment worth mentioning, as in other regions, but keeps sliding away ceaselessly and disappearing in the deep.  And, just as happens in small islands, what now remains compared with what then existed is like the skeleton of a sick man, all the fat and soft earth having wasted away, and only the bare framework of the land being left.  But at that epoch the country was unimpaired, and for its mountains it had\nhigh arable hills, and in place of the moorlands, as they are now called, it contained plains full of rich soil;  and it had much forestland in its mountains, of which there are visible signs even to this day;  for there are some mountains which now have nothing but food for bees, but they had trees no very long time ago, and the rafters from those felled there to roof the largest buildings are still sound.  And besides, there were many lofty trees of cultivated species;  and it produced boundless pasturage for flocks.  Moreover, it was enriched by the yearly rains from Zeus,\nwhich were not lost to it, as now, by flowing from the bare land into the sea;  but the soil;  it had was deep, and therein it received the water, storing it up in the retentive loamy soil and by drawing off into the hollows from the heights the water that was there absorbed, it provided all the various districts with abundant supplies of springwaters and streams, whereof the shrines which still remain even now, at the spots where the fountains formerly existed, are signs which testify that our present description of the land is true.\n Such, then, was the natural condition of the rest of the country, and it was ornamented as you would expect from genuine husbandmen who made husbandry their sole task, and who were also men of taste and of native talent, and possessed of most excellent land and a great abundance of water, and also, above the land, a climate of most happily tempered seasons.  And as to the city, this is the way in which it was laid out at that time.  In the first place, the acropolis, as it existed then, was different from\nwhat it is now.  For as it is now, the action of a single night of extraordinary rain has crumbled it away and made it bare of soil, when earthquakes occurred simultaneously with the third of the disastrous floods which preceded the destructive deluge in the time of Deucalion. But in its former extent, at an earlier period, it went down towards the  and the , and embraced within it the Pnyx;  and had the Lycabettus as its boundary over against the Pnyx;  and it was all rich in soil and, save for a small space, level on the top.\nAnd its outer parts, under its slopes, were inhabited by the craftsmen and by such of the husbandmen as had their farms close by;  but on the topmost part only the military class by itself had its dwellings round about the temple of Athene and Hephaestus, surrounding themselves with a single ring-fence, which formed, as it were, the enclosure of a single dwelling.  On the northward side of it they had established their public dwellings and winter mess-rooms, and all the arrangements in the way of buildings which were required for the community life\nof themselves and the priests;  but all was devoid of gold or silver, of which they made no use anywhere; on the contrary, they aimed at the mean between luxurious display and meanness, and built themselves tasteful houses, wherein they and their children's children grew old and handed them on in succession unaltered to others like themselves.  As for the southward parts, when they vacated their gardens and gymnasia and mess-rooms as was natural in summer, they used them for these purposes.  And near the place of the present Acropolis\nthere was one spring which was choked up by the earthquakes so that but small tricklings of it are now left round about;  but to the men of that time it afforded a plentiful stream for them all, being well tempered both for winter and summer.  In this fashion, then, they dwelt, acting as guardians of their own citizens and as leaders, by their own consent, of the rest of the Greeks and they watched carefully that their own numbers, of both men and women, who were neither too young nor too old to fight, should remain for all time as nearly as possible the same, namely, about 20,000.\n So it was that these men, being themselves of the character described and always justly administering in some such fashion both their own land and , were famous throughout all  and  both for their bodily beauty and for the perfection of their moral excellence, and were of all men then living the most renowned.  And now, if we have not lost recollection of what we heard when we were still children, we will frankly impart to you all, as friends, our story of the men who warred against our Athenians, what their state was and how it originally came about.\n But before I begin my account, there is still a small point which I ought to explain, lest you should be surprised at frequently hearing Greek names given to barbarians.  The reason of this you shall now learn.  Since Solon was planning to make use of the story for his own poetry, he had found, on investigating the meaning of the names, that those Egyptians who had first written them down had translated them into their own tongue.  So he himself in turn recovered the original sense of each name and, rendering it into our tongue,\nwrote it down so.  And these very writings were in the possession of my grandfather and are actually now in mine, and when I was a child I learnt them all by heart.  Therefore if the names you hear are just like our local names, do not be at all astonished;  for now you know the reason for them.  The story then told was a long one, and it began something like this.Like as we previously stated concerning the allotments of the Gods, that they portioned out the whole earth, here into larger allotments and there into smaller, and provided for themselves\nshrines and sacrifices, even so Poseidon took for his allotment the island of Atlantis and settled therein the children whom he had begotten of a mortal woman in a region of the island of the following description.  Bordering on the sea and extending through the center of the whole island there was a plain, which is said to have been the fairest of all plains and highly fertile;  and, moreover, near the plain, over against its center, at a distance of about 50 stades, there stood a mountain that was low on all sides.  Thereon dwelt one of the natives originally sprung from the earth, Evenor by name,\nwith his wife Leucippe;  and they had for offspring an only-begotten daughter, Cleito.  And when this damsel was now come to marriageable age, her mother died and also her father;  and Poseidon, being smitten with desire for her, wedded her;  and to make the hill whereon she dwelt impregnable he broke it off all round about;  and he made circular belts of sea and land enclosing one another alternately, some greater, some smaller, two being of land and three of sea, which he carved as it were out of the midst of the island;  and these belts were at even distances on all sides, so as to be impassable for man;\nfor at that time neither ships nor sailing were as yet in existence.  And Poseidon himself set in order with ease, as a god would, the central island, bringing up from beneath the earth two springs of waters, the one flowing warm from its source, the other cold, and producing out of the earth all kinds of food in plenty.  And he begat five pairs of twin sons and reared them up;  and when he had divided all the island of Atlantis into ten portions, he assigned to the first-born of the eldest sons\nhis mother's dwelling and the allotment surrounding it, which was the largest and best;  and him he appointed to be king over the rest, and the others to be rulers, granting to each the rule over many men and a large tract of country.  And to all of them he gave names, giving to him that was eldest and king the name after which the whole island was called and the sea spoken of as the Atlantic, because the first king who then reigned had the name of Atlas.  And the name of his younger twin-brother,\nwho had for his portion the extremity of the island near the pillars of Heracles up to the part of the country now called Gadeira after the name of that region, was Eumelus in Greek, but in the native tongue Gadeirus,which fact may have given its title to the country.  And of the pair that were born next he called the one Ampheres and the other Evaemon;  and of the third pair the elder was named Mneseus\nand the younger Autochthon;  and of the fourth pair, he called the first Elasippus and the second Mestor;  and of the fifth pair, Azaes was the name given to the elder, and Diaprepes to the second.  So all these, themselves and their descendants, dwelt for many generations bearing rule over many other islands throughout the sea, and holding sway besides, as was previously stated, over the Mediterranean peoples as far as  and .Now a large family of distinguished sons sprang from Atlas;\nbut it was the eldest, who, as king, always passed on the scepter to the eldest of his sons, and thus they preserved the sovereignty for many generations;  and the wealth they possessed was so immense that the like had never been seen before in any royal house nor will ever easily be seen again;  and they were provided with everything of which provision was needed either in the city or throughout the rest of the country.  For because of their headship they had a large supply of imports from abroad,\nand the island itself furnished most of the requirements of daily life,metals, to begin with, both the hard kind and the fusible kind, which are extracted by mining, and also that kind which is now known only by name but was more than a name then, there being mines of it in many places of the island,I mean orichalcum, which was the most precious of the metals then known, except gold.  It brought forth also in abundance all the timbers that a forest provides for the labors of carpenters;  and of animals it produced a sufficiency, both of tame and wild.  Moreover, it contained a very large stock of elephants;  for there was an ample food-supply not only for all the other animals which haunt the marshes and lakes and rivers,\nor the mountains or the plains, but likewise also for this animal, which of its nature is the largest and most voracious.  And in addition to all this, it produced and brought to perfection all those sweet-scented stuffs which the earth produces now, whether made of roots or herbs or trees, or of liquid gums derived from flowers or fruits.  The cultivated fruit also, and the dry, which serves us for nutriment, and all the other kinds that we use for our mealsthe various species of which are comprehended under the name vegetables\nand all the produce of trees which affords liquid and solid food and unguents, and the fruit of the orchard-trees, so hard to store, which is grown for the sake of amusement and pleasure, and all the after-dinner fruits that we serve up as welcome remedies for the sufferer from repletion,all these that hallowed island, as it lay then beneath the sun, produced in marvellous beauty and endless abundance.  And thus, receiving from the earth all these products, they furnished forth\ntheir temples and royal dwellings, their harbors and their docks, and all the rest of their country, ordering all in the fashion following.First of all they bridged over the circles of sea which surrounded the ancient metropolis, making thereby a road towards and from the royal palace.  And they had built the palace at the very beginning where the settlement was first made by their God and their ancestors;  and as each king received it from his predecessor, he added to its adornment\nand did all he could to surpass the king before him, until finally they made of it an abode amazing to behold for the magnitude and beauty of its workmanship.  For, beginning at the sea, they bored a channel right through to the outermost circle, which was three plethra in breadth, one hundred feet in depth, and fifty stades in length;  and thus they made the entrance to it from the sea like that to a harbor by opening out a mouth large enough for the greatest ships to sail through. Moreover, through the circles of land,\nwhich divided those of sea, over against the bridges they opened out a channel leading from circle to circle, large enough to give passage to a single trireme;  and this they roofed over above so that the sea-way was subterranean;  for the lips of the landcircles were raised a sufficient height above the level of the sea.  The greatest of the circles into which a boring was made for the sea was three stades in breadth, and the circle of land next to it was of equal breadth;  and of the second pair of circles that of water was two stades in breadth and that of dry land equal again to the preceding one of water;  and the circle which ran round the central island itself was of a stade's breadth.  And this island,\nwherein stood the royal palace, was of five stades in diameter.  Now the island and the circles and the bridge, which was a plethrum in breadth, they encompassed round about, on this side and on that, with a wall of stone;  and upon the bridges on each side, over against the passages for the sea, they erected towers and gates.  And the stone they quarried beneath the central island all round, and from beneath the outer and inner circles, some of it being white, some black\nand some red;  and while quarrying it they constructed two inner docks, hollowed out and roofed over by the native rock.  And of the buildings some they framed of one simple color, in others they wove a pattern of many colors by blending the stones for the sake of ornament so as to confer upon the buildings a natural charm.  And they covered with brass, as though with plaster, all the circumference of the wall which surrounded the outermost circle;  and that of the inner one they coated with tin;  and that which encompassed the acropolis itself\nwith orichalcum which sparkled like fire.The royal palace within the acropolis was arranged in this manner.  In the center there stood a temple sacred to Cleito and Poseidon, which was reserved as holy ground, and encircled with a wall of gold;  this being the very spot where at the beginning they had generated and brought to birth the family of the ten royal lines.  Thither also they brought year by year from all the ten allotments their seasonable offerings to do sacrifice to each of those princes.\nAnd the temple of Poseidon himself was a stade in length, three plethra in breadth, and of a height which appeared symmetrical therewith;  and there was something of the barbaric in its appearance.  All the exterior of the temple they coated with silver, save only the pinnacles, and these they coated with gold.  As to the interior, they made the roof all of ivory in appearance, variegated with gold and silver and orichalcum, and all the rest of the walls and pillars and floors they covered with orichalcum.  And they placed therein golden statues, one being that of the God standing on a chariot and driving six\nwinged steeds, his own figure so tall as to touch the ridge of the roof, and round about him a hundred Nereids on dolphins (for that was the number of them as men then believed);  and it contained also many other images, the votive offerings of private men.  And outside, round about the temple, there stood images in gold of all the princes, both themselves and their wives, as many as were descended from the ten kings, together with many other votive offerings both of the kings and of private persons not only from the State itself but also from all the foreign peoples over whom they ruled.  And the altar,\nin respect of its size and its workmanship, harmonized with its surroundings;  and the royal palace likewise was such as befitted the greatness of the kingdom, and equally befitted the splendor of the temples.The springs they made use of, one kind being of cold, another of warm water, were of abundant volume, and each kind was wonderfully well adapted for use because of the natural taste and excellence of its waters;  and these they surrounded with buildings and with plantations of trees such as suited the waters;\nand, moreover, they set reservoirs round about, some under the open sky, and others under cover to supply hot baths in the winter;  they put separate baths for the kings and for the private citizens, besides others for women, and others again for horses and all other beasts of burden, fitting out each in an appropriate manner. And the outflowing water they conducted to the sacred grove of Poseidon, which contained trees of all kinds that were of marvellous beauty and height because of the richness of the soil;  and by means of channels they led the water to the outer circles over against the bridges.\nAnd there they had constructed many temples for gods, and many gardens and many exercising grounds, some for men and some set apart for horses, in each of the circular belts of island;  and besides the rest they had in the center of the large island a racecourse laid out for horses, which was a stade in width, while as to length, a strip which ran round the whole circumference was reserved for equestrian contests.  And round about it, on this side and on that, were barracks for the greater part of the spearmen;  but the guard-house of the more trusty\nof them was posted in the smaller circle, which was nearer the acropolis;  while those who were the most trustworthy of all had dwellings granted to them within the acropolis round about the persons of the kings.And the shipyards were full of triremes and all the tackling that belongs to triremes, and they were all amply equipped.Such then was the state of things round about the abode of the kings.  And after crossing the three outer harbors,\none found a wall which began at the sea and ran round in a circle, at a uniform distance of fifty stades from the largest circle and harbor, and its ends converged at the seaward mouth of the channel.  The whole of this wall had numerous houses built on to it, set close together;  while the sea-way and the largest harbor were filled with ships and merchants coming from all quarters, which by reason of their multitude caused clamor and tumult of every description and an unceasing din night and day.Now as regards the city and the environs of the ancient dwelling we have now wellnigh completed the description as it was originally given.  We must endeavor next to repeat the account of the rest of the country,\nwhat its natural character was, and in what fashion it was ordered.  In the first place, then, according to the account, the whole region rose sheer out of the sea to a great height, but the part about the city was all a smooth plain, enclosing it round about, and being itself encircled by mountains which stretched as far as to the sea;  and this plain had a level surface and was as a whole rectangular in shape, being 3000 stades long on either side and 2000 stades wide at its center, reckoning upwards from the sea.  And this region,\nall along the island, faced towards the South and was sheltered from the Northern blasts.  And the mountains which surrounded it were at that time celebrated as surpassing all that now exist in number, magnitude and beauty;  for they had upon them many rich villages of country folk, and streams and lakes and meadows which furnished ample nutriment to all the animals both tame and wild, and timber of various sizes and descriptions, abundantly sufficient for the needs of all and every craft.\n Now as a result of natural forces, together with the labors of many kings which extended over many ages, the condition of the plain was this.  It was originally a quadrangle, rectilinear for the most part, and elongated;  and what it lacked of this shape they made right by means of a trench dug round about it.  Now, as regards the depth of this trench and its breadth and length, it seems incredible that it should be so large as the account states, considering that it was made by hand, and in addition to all the other operations, but none the less we must report what we heard:  it was dug out to the depth of a plethrum and to a uniform breadth of a stade, and since it was dug round the whole plain\nits consequent length was 10,000 stades. It received the streams which came down from the mountains and after circling round the plain, and coming towards the city on this side and on that, it discharged them thereabouts into the sea.  And on the inland side of the city channels were cut in straight lines, of about 100 feet in width, across the plain, and these discharged themselves into the trench on the seaward side, the distance between each being 100 stades.  It was in this way that they conveyed to the city\nthe timber from the mountains and transported also on boats the seasons' products, by cutting transverse passages from one channel to the next and also to the city.  And they cropped the land twice a year, making use of the rains from Heaven in the winter, and the waters that issue from the earth in summer, by conducting the streams from the trenches.As regards their manpower, it was ordained that each allotment should furnish one man as leader of all the men in the plain who were fit to bear arms;\nand the size of the allotment was about ten times ten stades, and the total number of all the allotments was 60,000;  and the number of the men in the mountains and in the rest of the country was countless, according to the report, and according to their districts and villages they were all assigned to these allotments under their leaders.  So it was ordained that each such leader should provide for war the sixth part of a war-chariots equipment, so as to make up 10,000 chariots in all, together with two horses and mounted men;\nalso a pair of horses without a car, and attached thereto a combatant with a small shield and for charioteer the rider who springs from horse to horse;  and two hoplites;  and archers and slingers, two of each;  and light-armed slingers and javelin-men, three of each;  and four sailors towards the manning of twelve hundred ships.  Such then were the military dispositions of the royal City;  and those of the other nine varied in various ways, which it would take a long time to tell.\n Of the magistracies and posts of honor the disposition, ever since the beginning, was this.  Each of the ten kings ruled over the men and most of the laws in his own particular portion and throughout his own city, punishing and putting to death whomsoever he willed.  But their authority over one another and their mutual relations were governed by the precepts of Poseidon, as handed down to them by the law and by the records inscribed by the first princes on a pillar of orichalcum, which was placed within the temple of Poseidon in the center of the island;\nand thither they assembled every fifth year, and then alternately every sixth yeargiving equal honor to both the even and the oddand when thus assembled they took counsel about public affairs and inquired if any had in any way transgressed and gave judgement.  And when they were about to give judgement they first gave pledges one to another of the following description.  In the sacred precincts of Poseidon there were bulls at large;  and the ten princes, being alone by themselves, after praying to the God that they might capture a victim well-pleasing unto him,\nhunted after the bulls with staves and nooses but with no weapon of iron;  and whatsoever bull they captured they led up to the pillar and cut its throat over the top of the pillar, raining down blood on the inscription.  And inscribed upon the pillar, besides the laws, was an oath which invoked mighty curses upon them that disobeyed.  When, then, they had done sacrifice according to their laws and were consecrating\nall the limbs of the bull, they mixed a bowl of wine and poured in on behalf of each one a gout of blood, and the rest they carried to the fire, when they had first purged the pillars round about.  And after this they drew out from the bowl with golden ladles, and making libation over the fire swore to give judgement according to the laws upon the pillar and to punish whosoever had committed any previous transgression;  and, moreover, that henceforth they would not transgress any of the writings willingly, nor govern nor submit to any governor's edict\nsave in accordance with their father's laws.  And when each of them had made this invocation both for himself and for his seed after him, he drank of the cup and offered it up as a gift in the temple of the God;  and after spending the interval in supping and necessary business, when darkness came on and the sacrificial fire had died down, all the princes robed themselves in most beautiful sable vestments, and sate on the ground beside the cinders of the sacramental victims throughout the night, extinguishing all the fire that was round about the sanctuary;\nand there they gave and received judgement, if any of them accused any of committing any transgression.  And when they had given judgement, they wrote the judgements, when it was light, upon a golden tablet, and dedicated them together with their robes as memorials.  And there were many other special laws concerning the peculiar rights of the several princes, whereof the most important were these:  that they should never take up arms against one another, and that, should anyone attempt to overthrow in any city their royal house, they should all lend aid, taking counsel in common, like their forerunners,\nconcerning their policy in war and other matters, while conceding the leadership to the royal branch of Atlas;  and that the king had no authority to put to death any of his brother-princes save with the consent of more than half of the ten.Such was the magnitude and character of the power which existed in those regions at that time;  and this power the God set in array and brought against these regions of ours on some such pretext as the following, according to the story.  For many generations,\nso long as the inherited nature of the God remained strong in them, they were submissive to the laws and kindly disposed to their divine kindred.  For the intents of their hearts were true and in all ways noble, and they showed gentleness joined with wisdom in dealing with the changes and chances of life and in their dealings one with another.  Consequently they thought scorn of everything save virtue and lightly esteemed their rich possessions, bearing with ease\nthe burden, as it were, of the vast volume of their gold and other goods;  and thus their wealth did not make them drunk with pride so that they lost control of themselves and went to ruin;  rather, in their soberness of mind they clearly saw that all these good things are increased by general amity combined with virtue, whereas the eager pursuit and worship of these goods not only causes the goods themselves to diminish but makes virtue also to perish with them.  As a result, then, of such reasoning and of the continuance of their divine nature all their wealth had grown to such a greatness as we previously described.  But when the portion of divinity within them was now becoming faint and weak through being ofttimes blended with a large measure of mortality,\nwhereas the human temper was becoming dominant, then at length they lost their comeliness, through being unable to bear the burden of their possessions, and became ugly to look upon, in the eyes of him who has the gift of sight;  for they had lost the fairest of their goods from the most precious of their parts;  but in the eyes of those who have no gift of perceiving what is the truly happy life, it was then above all that they appeared to be superlatively fair and blessed, filled as they were with lawless ambition and power.  And Zeus, the God of gods, who reigns by Law, inasmuch as he has the gift of perceiving such things, marked how this righteous race was in evil plight, and desired to inflict punishment upon them, to the end that when chastised they might strike a truer note.\nWherefore he assembled together all the gods into that abode which they honor most, standing as it does at the center of all the Universe, and beholding all things that partake of generation and when he had assembled them, he spake thus:"}}]}}, {"@n": "Minos", "body": {"head": "Minos", "castList": {"castItem": [{"@type": "role", "role": "Socrates"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Companion"}]}, "milestone": [{"@unit": "page", "@n": "313"}, {"@n": "313a", "@unit": "section"}], "sp": [{"speaker": "Socrates", "p": "Tell me, what is law?"}, {"speaker": "Companion", "p": "To what kind of law does your question refer?"}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": {"milestone": {"@n": "313b", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "What!

For this reason you must learn to distinguish honest and dishonest men:  for God feels resentment when one blames a man who is like himself, or praises a man who is the opposite;  and the former is the good man.  For you must not suppose that while stocks and stones and birds and snakes are sacred, men are not;  nay, the good man is the most sacred of all these things, and the wicked man is the most defiled.So if I now proceed to relate how Minos is eulogized by Homer\nand Hesiod, my purpose is to prevent you, a man sprung from a man, from making a mistake in regard to a hero who was the son of Zeus. For Homer, in telling of  that there were in it many men and ninety cities, says:\nNow here in Homer we have a eulogy of Minos, briefly expressed, such as the poet never composed for a single one of the heroes.  For that Zeus is a sophist, and that sophistry is a highly honorable art, he makes plain in many other places, and particularly here.  For he says that Minos consorted and discoursed with Zeus in the ninth year, and went regularly to be educated by Zeus as though he were a sophist.  And the fact that Homer assigned this privilege of having been educated by Zeus to no one among the heroes but Minos makes this a marvellous piece of praise. \nAnd in the Ghost-raising in the  he has described Minos as judging with a golden scepter in his hand, but not Rhadamanthus:  Rhadamanthus he has neither described here as judging nor anywhere as consorting with Zeus;  wherefore I say that Minos above all persons has been eulogized by Homer.  For to have been the son of Zeus, and to have been the only one who was educated by Zeus, is praise unsurpassable.For the meaning of the verse \nis that Minos was a disciple of Zeus.  For colloquies are discourses, and he who has colloquy is a disciple by means of discourse.  So every ninth year Minos repaired to the cave of Zeus, to learn some things, and to show his knowledge of others that he had learnt from Zeus in the preceding nine years.  Some there are who suppose that he who has colloquy is a cup-companion and fellow-jester of Zeus:  but one may take the following as a proof that\nthey who suppose so are babblers.  For of all the many nations of men, both Greek and foreign, the only people who refrain from drinking-bouts and the jesting that occurs where there is wine, are the Cretans, and after them the Spartans, who learnt it from the Cretans.  In  it is one of their laws which Minos ordained that they are not to drink with each other to intoxication.  And yet it is evident that the things he thought honorable were what he ordained as lawful for his people as well.  For surely Minos did not, like an inferior person,\nthink one thing and do another, different from what he thought:  no, this intercourse, as I say, was held by means of discussion for education in virtue.  Wherefore he ordained for his people these very laws, which have made  happy through the length of time, and  happy also, since she began to use them;  for they are divine.Rhadamanthus was a good man indeed, for he had been educated by Minos;  he had, however, been educated,\nnot in the whole of the kingly art, but in one subsidiary to the kingly, enough for presiding in law courts;  so that he was spoken of as a good judge.  For Minos used him as guardian of the law in the city, and Talos as the same for the rest of .

So follow me now and apprehend if you conceive me, as well as them, to be giving a proper account of this matter.  I say it is impossible for men to be blessed and happy, except a few;  that is, so long as we are living:  I limit it to that.  But one may rightly hope to attain after death all the things for whose sake one may strive both in life to live as nobly as one can and in death to find a noble end. What I say is\nno subtle doctrine, but a thing that all of us, Greeks and foreigners alike, in some way perceivethat from the beginning existence is difficult for every live creature:  first, partaking of the state of things conceived, then again, being born, and further, being reared and educatedall these processes involve a vast amount of toil,\nwe all agree.  And our time must be a short one, I do not say in the reckoning of the wretched, but on any supposition of what is tolerable.  It does seem to give just a breathing-space about the middle of human life:  yet swiftly old age is upon us, and must make any of us loth ever to live our life again, when one reckons over the life one has livedunless one happens to be a bundle of childish notions.

Yet the soul firmly believes and divines that in some fashion she has it,\nbut what it is that she has, or when, or how, she is quite unable to discover.  Is not this a fair picture of our puzzle about wisdom and the inquiry that we have to makea greater one than any of us could expect who are found able to examine ourselves and others intelligently and consistently by every kind and manner of argument?

Now we must mention what they are, and that almost everyone who makes it his aim to be thought likely to prove himself in the end as good a man as possible avoids them, in order to gain the acquirements of understanding and study.  So first let us take the practice among animate beings of eating each other, which, as the story goes, has made us refrain entirely from some, while it has settled us in the lawful eating of others. May the men of old time be gracious to us, as they are:  for we must take our leave of whatever men were the first of those we were just mentioning;  but at any rate\nthe making of barley-meal and flour, with the sustenance thereof, is noble and good indeed, yet it is never like to produce a perfectly wise man.  For this very name of making must produce an irksomeness in the actual things that are made.  Nor can it well be husbandry of land in general:  for it is not by art but by a natural gift from Heaven, it seems, that we all have the earth put into our hands.  Nor again is it the fabrication of dwellings and building in general, nor the production of all sorts of appliancessmiths' work,\nand the supply of carpenters', moulders', plaiters', and, in fine, all kinds of implements;  for this is of advantage to the public, but is not accounted for virtue.  Nor again the whole practice of hunting, which although grown extensive and a matter of skilled art, gives no return of magnificence with its wisdom.  Nor surely can it be divination or interpretation as a whole;  for these only know what is said, but have not learnt whether it be true.And now that we see that the acquisition of necessaries\nis achieved by means of art, but that no such art makes any man wise, there may be some diversion remaining after thisimitative for the most part, but in no way serious.  For they imitate with many instruments, and with many imitative acts, not altogether seemly, of their very bodies, in performances both of speech and of every Muse, and in those whereof painting is mother, and whereby many and most various designs are elaborated in many sorts, moist and dry;  and though a man ply his craft in these with the greatest zeal, in nothing is he rendered wise by imitation.\n And when all these have been performed, there may yet remain assistance, in countless forms and countless cases:  the greatest and most useful is called warfare, the art of generalship;  most glorified in time of need, requiring most good fortune, and assigned rather to a natural valor than to wisdom. \nAnd that which they call medicine is likewise, of course, an assistance in almost every case towards things of which animal nature is deprived by seasons of untimely cold and heat and all such visitations.  But none of these is of high repute for the truest wisdom:  for they are borne along by opinion, as inaccurate matter of conjecture.  We may, I suppose, speak of pilots and sailors alike as giving assistance:  yet you shall not report, to appease us, a single wise man from amongst them all;  for a man cannot know\nthe wrath or amity of the wind, a desirable thing for all piloting.  Nor again all those who say they can give assistance in law suits by their powers of speech, men who by memory and exercise of opinion pay attention to human character, but are far astray from the truth of what is really just.There still remains, as a claimant to the name of wisdom, a certain strange power, which most people would call a natural gift rather than wisdom, appearing when one perceives someone learning this or that lesson with ease, or remembering a great many things\nsecurely;  or when one recalls what is suitable to each person, what should properly be done, and does it quickly.  Some people will describe all this as nature, others as wisdom, and others as a natural readiness of mind:  but no sensible person will ever call a man really wise for any of these gifts.But surely there must be found some science, the possession of which will cause the wisdom of him who is really wise and not wise merely in men's opinion.  Well, let us see:  for in this laborious discussion we are trying our hardest to find some other science,\napart from those we have mentioned, which can really and reasonably be termed wisdom;  such an acquirement as will not make one a mean and witless drudge, but will enable one to be a wise and good citizen, at once a just ruler and subject of his city, and decorous. So let us examine this one first, and see what single science it is of those that we now have which, by removing itself or being absent from human nature, must render mankind the most thoughtless and senseless of creatures. \nWell, there is no great difficulty in making that out.  For if there is one more than another, so to speak, which will do this, it is the science which gave number to the whole race of mortals;  and I believe God rather than some chance gave it to us, and so preserves us.  And I must explain who it is that I believe to be God, though he be a strange one, and somehow not strange either:  for why should we not believe\nthe cause of all the good things that are ours to have been the cause also of what is far the greatest, understanding?  And who is it that I magnify with the name of God, Megillus and Cleinias?  Merely Heaven, which it is most our duty to honor and pray to especially, as do all other spirits and gods.  That it has been the cause of all the other good things we have, we shall all admit;  that it likewise gave us number we do really say, and that it will give us this hereafter, if we will but follow its lead. \nFor if one enters on the right theory about it, whether one be pleased to call it World-order or  or Heavenlet one call it this or that, but follow where, in bespangling itself and turning the stars that it contains, it produces all their courses and the seasons and food for all.  And thence, accordingly, we have understanding in general, we may say, and therewith all number, and all other good things:  but the greatest of these is when, after receiving its gift of numbers, one has covered the whole circuit.Moreover, let us turn back some little way in our discussion\nand recall how entirely right we were in conceiving that if we should deprive human nature of number we should never attain to any understanding.  For then the soul of that creature which could not tell things would never any more be able, one may say, to attain virtue in general;  and the creature that did not know two and three, or odd or even, and was completely ignorant of number, could never clearly tell of things about which it had only acquired sensations and memories.  From the attainment of ordinary virtue\ncourage and temperanceit is certainly not debarred:  but if a man is deprived of true telling he can never become wise, and he who has not the acquirement of wisdomthe greatest part of virtue as a wholecan no more achieve the perfect goodness which may make him happy.  Thus it is absolutely necessary to postulate number;  and why this is necessary can be shown by a still fuller argument than any that has been advanced.  But here is one that will be particularly correctthat of the properties of the other arts, which we recounted just now in granting the existence of all the arts,\nnot a single one can remain, but all of them are utterly defective, when once you remove numeration.And one may judge, perhaps, for brevity's sake how the human race needs number, by glancing at the artsand yet that too is a great matterbut if you note the divinity of birth, and its mortality, in which awe of the divine must be acknowledged, and real number,\nit is not anybody who can tell how great is the power which we owe to the accompaniment of number as a wholefor it is clear that everything in music needs a distinct numeration of movement and notesand above all, how it is the cause of all good things;  and that it is the cause of no evil thing is a point that must be well understood, as it may be quickly enough.  Nay, the motion that we may call unreasoned and unordered, lacking shape and rhythm and harmony, and everything that has a share of some evil,\nis deficient in number altogether;  and in this light must the matter be regarded by him who means to end his life in happiness.  And no one who does not know the just, the good, the honorable and all the rest of such qualities, with a hold on true opinion, will number them off so as fully to persuade both himself and his neighbor.Now let us go on to inquire into the actual question of how we learnt to count in numbers.  Tell me, whence have we got the conception of one and two, a natural gift that\nwe have from the All to enable us to conceive of their existence?  Then again, many other living creatures are not endowed by nature even to the actual point of being able to learn from their father to count;  whereas in us, in the first place, God implanted this very conception, so that we might be equal to comprehending it when shown to us, and in the second place, he showed it and shows it.  Among such things, what one more singularly beautiful can a man behold than the world of day?  Then he comes to the province of night, and views it;  and there quite another sight\nlies before him.  And so the heaven, revolving these very objects for many nights and many days, never ceases to teach men one and two, until even the most unintelligent have learnt sufficiently to number;  for that there are also three and four and many, each of us must further conceive on seeing those objects.  And God made one thing that he wrought from them, the moon, which shows herself at one time larger, at another smaller, and runs her course,\nshowing ever a new shape, until fifteen days and nights are passed:  this is her circuit, if one chooses to sum her orbit, as one and entire, in one;  so that, we may say, even the least intelligent creature must learn it, among those on whom God has bestowed the natural gift of being able to learn.  Within certain limits, and in certain cases, every creature so enabled has been made fully apt for numeration,\nwhen it considers any unit in itself.  But as to reckoning number generally in the relations of things to each other, I think that God, if not for a greater reason, to this end interposed, as we mentioned, the waxing and waning of the moon, and arranged the months to make up the year, and all things began to comprehend number in relation to number by a happy fortune.  Hence it is that we have fruits and the teeming of the earth, so that there may be food for all creatures, with no inordinate or immoderate occurrences of winds and rains: \nbut if in spite of this something does occur in an evil way, we ought not to charge it upon the divine but upon the human nature, for not disposing our own lives aright.Now in our inquiry about laws, you know we decided that all other things that are best for men are easy to discover, and that everyone may become competent both to understand and to perform what he is told, if he discovers what is that which is likely to profit him, and what is not profitable:  well, we decided, and we are still of the same mind, that all other studies\nare not very difficult, but that this of learning in what way we should become good men is one of the utmost difficulty.  Everything else, again, that is good, as they say, is both possible and not difficult to acquire, and the amount of property that is wanted or not wanted, and the kind of body that is wanted or not:  everyone agrees that a good soul is wanted, and agrees, moreover, as to the manner of its goodness, that for this again it must be just and temperate and brave;  but whereas everyone says it must be wise, no one any longer agrees at all with anyone else, in most caseswe have just now\nexplainedas to what its wisdom should be.  So now we are discovering, besides all those former kinds, a wisdom of no mean worth for this very purpose of showing how he is wise who has learnt the things that we have explained.  And if he is wise who has knowledge of these things and is good at them, we must now take account of him."}}, {"speaker": "Cleinias", "p": {"milestone": {"@n": "979e", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "Good sir, how properly you said that you are undertaking to express great thoughts on great subjects!"}}, {"speaker": "Athenian", "p": "Yes, for they are not small, Cleinias:  but what is more difficult is to show that they are entirely and in every sense true."}, {"speaker": "Cleinias", "p": "Very much so, good sir:  but still, do not weary of the task of stating your views."}, {"speaker": "Athenian", "p": "I will not, and therefore you two must not weary either of listening to me."}, {"speaker": "Cleinias", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "page", "@n": "980"}, {"@n": "980a", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Agreed:  I give you my word for us both."}}, {"speaker": "Athenian", "p": "Thank you.

And this alone, one may say, has the business of fashioning and manufacturing,\nwhereas the body, as we call it, has that of being fashioned and produced and seen.  But the otherlet us repeat it, for not once only be it saidhas to be invisible even to the inquiring, and merely thought, if he has got a share of memory and reckoning by both odd and even variations. The bodies, then, being five, we must name them as fire, water, and thirdly air, earth fourth, and ether fifth;  and by predominance of these are each of the many varieties of creatures perfected.  We should learn this by single instances in the following way. \nLet us take as earthy our first single elementall men, all things that have many feet or none, and those that move along and that stay still, held in place by roots;  but we must conceive its unity thus, though all these things are the outcome of all kinds, yet for the most part it is of earth and of solid nature.  And another kind of creature we must regard as second in birth as well as one that can be seen:  for its greatest part is of fire, though it has some earth and\nair, and has slight portions of all the others also, wherefore we must say that all sorts of creatures are born of them, and things seen, and here again we must conceive the heavenly kinds of creatures, which altogether, we must agree, have been born as the divine race of stars, endowed with the fairest body as also with the happiest and best soul. One or other of two lots we may very well, in our judgement, assign to them:  for each of them is either imperishable\nand immortal, and by all necessity wholly divine, or has a certain longevity sufficient for the life of each, such that nothing could ever require a longer one.Let us therefore first observe that, as we state it, such creatures are of two sortsfor let us state it againboth visible, the one of fire, as would appear, entirely, and the other of earth;  and the earthy is in disorder, whereas that of fire has its motion in perfect order.  Now that which has motion in disorder we should regard as unintelligent, acting\nlike the animal creatures about us for the most part;  but that which has an orderly and heavenly progress must be taken as strongly evincing its intelligence.  For in passing on and acting and being acted upon always in the same respects and manner it must provide sufficient evidence of its intelligent life.  The necessity of a soul that has acquired mind will prove itself by far the greatest of all necessities;  for it makes laws as ruler, not as ruled:  but this inalterable thing, when\nthe soul has taken the best counsel in accord with the best mind, comes out as the perfect thing in truth and in accord with mind, and not even adamant could ever prove stronger than it or more inalterable;  but in fact the three Fates have it in hold, and keep watch that what has been decided by each of the gods with the best counsel shall be perfect.  And men ought to have found proof of the stars and the whole of that travelling system being possessed of mind in the fact that they always do the same things because they do what has been decided long ago for an incalculable time,\nnot deciding differently this way and that, and doing sometimes one thing, sometimes another, in wanderings and changes of circuit.  Most of us have thought just the oppositethat because they do the same things in the same way they have no soul:  the multitude followed the lead of the unintelligent so far as to suppose that, whereas humanity was intelligent and living because it moved about, divinity was unintelligent because it abode in the same courses.  But if man had sided with the fairer and better and\nfriendly part, he might have concluded that he ought to regard as intelligentand for this very reasonthat which acts always in the same respects, in the same way, and for the same reasons;  and that this is the nature of the stars, fairest to see, and passing along, dancing the fairest and most magnificent of all dances in the world, they make good the needs of all living creatures.  And now, to see how justly we speak of their living spirit,\nlet us first consider their great size.  For they are not actually those small things that they appear to be, but each of them is immense in its bulk;  we should do well to believe this, because there are ample proofs of such a conclusion.  For we can rightly consider the whole of the sun as larger than the whole of the earth, and all the travelling stars are of amazing size.  Let us conclude then whether it can possibly be that any natural force revolves this great mass that is now being revolved, continually and at the same time. \nGod, then, I say, will be the cause, and never in any other way is it possible.  For never can a thing get living spirit by any other means than by the act of God, as we have explained;  and when God is able to do this, he has found it a perfectly easy matter, firstly that all body and all mass should be made a living creature, and secondly to move it in the course he considers best.  So now I trust we may make one true statement about all these things:  it cannot be that earth and heaven and all the\nstars and all the masses they comprise, without soul attached to each or resident in each, should pass along as they do, so exactly to every year and month and day, and that all the things that happen should happen for the good of us all.And according as man is a meaner creature, he should show himself, not a babbler, but a speaker of clear sense.  If, then, anyone shall speak of onrushes or natural forces or the like as in a sort the causes of bodies, he will say nothing clear:  but we must firmly recall what we have said, and see whether\nour statement is reasonable or is utterly at faultnamely, in the first place, that existence is of two kinds, the one soul, and the other body, and that many things are in either, though all are different from each other and those of the one kind from those of the other, and that there is no other third thing common to any of them;  but soul differs from body.  Intelligent, of course, we shall hold it to be, and the other unintelligent;  the one governs, the other is governed;  and the one is cause of all things, while the other is incapable of causing any of its experiences:  so that to assert that the heavenly bodies\nhave come into existence through anything else, and are not the offspring, as we have said, of soul and body, is great folly and unreason.  However, if our statements on all such existences are to prevail, and the whole order of them is to be convincingly shown to be divine by their origin, we must certainly class them as one or the other of two things:  either we must in all correctness glorify them as actual gods,\nor suppose them to be images produced as likenesses of the gods, creations of the gods themselves.  For they are the work of no mindless or inconsiderable beings but, as we have said, we must class them as one or other of these things;  and, if classed as the latter, we must honor them far above all images:  for never will fairer or more generally-known images be found among all mankind, none established in more various places, more pre-eminent in purity, majesty, and\nlife altogether, than in the way in which their existence is altogether fashioned.  Well then, for the present let us attempt so much in treating of the gods, as to tryafter observing the two living creatures visible to us, of which we call one immortal, and the other, all earthy, a mortal creationto tell of the three middle things of the five, which come most evidently, according to the probable opinion, between those two.  For let us consider ether as coming next after fire, and let us hold that soul fashions from it live creatures with their faculties, as it does creatures from the other kinds of element,\neach being for the most part of that one nature, but in its lesser parts derived from the other elements for the sake of connection.  After ether, there is fashioned by soul another kind of creature from air, and the third kind from water;  and by having produced all these it is likely that soul filled the whole heaven with creatures, having made use of all the elements so far as it could, and all the creatures having been made participators in life;  but the second, third, fourth, and fifth kinds, which took their first origin from what are manifest gods,\nend finally in us men.Now the godsZeus and Hera and all the resteach man must regard in what light he pleases, though according to the same law, and must take this account as reliable.  But as our visible gods, greatest and most honorable and having keenest vision every way, we must count first the order of the stars and all else that we perceive existing with them;  and after these, and\nnext below these, the divine spirits, and air-born race, holding the third and middle situation, cause of interpretation, which we must surely honor with prayers for the sake of an auspicious journey across. We must say of either of these two creaturesthat which is of ether and, next to it, of airthat it is not entirely plain to sight:  when it is near by, it is not made manifest to us; \nbut partaking of extraordinary intelligence, as belonging to an order which is quick to learn and strong in memory, we may say that they understand the whole of our thoughts, and show extraordinary kindness to anyone of us who is a good man and true, and hate him who is utterly evil, as one who already partakes of suffering.  For we know that God, who has the privilege of the divine portion, is remote from these affections of pain and pleasure, but has a share of intelligence and knowledge in every sphere;  and the heaven being filled full of live creatures,\nthey interpret all men and all things both to one another and to the most exalted gods, because the middle creatures move both to earth and to the whole of heaven with a lightly rushing motion.  The kind which is of water, the fifth, we shall be right in representing as a semi-divine product of that element, and it is at one time seen, but at another is concealed through becoming obscure, presenting a marvel in the dimness of vision.  So these\nfive being really existent creatures, wherever any of us came upon them, either happening upon them in the dream-world of sleep, or by something spoken to persons listening in health, or equally in sickness, through ominous utterances and prophecies, or again when they have arrived at the end of life opinions that occur to us both in private and in public, whence many sanctities of many beings have arisen, and others shall arisein regard to all these the lawgiver who possesses even the slightest degree of mind will never dare by innovations to turn his city to a divine worship which is\nlacking in certainty.  Nor indeed will he put a stop to sacrifices on which the ancestral custom has pronounced, when he knows nothing at all of the matter, just as it is not possible for mortal nature to know about such things.  And of the gods who are really manifest to us the same statement must surely holdthat those men are most evil who have not courage to tell and make manifest to us that these are likewise gods, but without any frenzied rites, or any tribute of the honors that are their due.  But as things are, we have a strange conjunction\nof proceedings:  for it is as though one of us should see the sun or moon being born and all of us looking on, and should utter no word through some impotence of speech, and should not also at the same time be zealous, so far as in him lay, when they lacked their share of honor, to bring them in all evidence to an honored place, and cause festivals and sacrifices to be offered to them, and apportion to each a reserved space of time for the greater or lesser length of its year, as may happen: \nwould it not be agreed both by himself and by another who observed it that he would justly be described as an evil man?"}}, {"speaker": "Cleinias", "p": "To be sure he would, my good sir;  nay, most evil."}, {"speaker": "Athenian", "p": "Well then, this, my dear Cleinias, is what, you may take it, has evidently happened to me now."}, {"speaker": "Cleinias", "p": "How do you mean?"}, {"speaker": "Athenian", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "986b", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "986c", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "986d", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "986e", "@unit": "section"}, {"@unit": "page", "@n": "987"}, {"@n": "987a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "987b", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "987c", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "987d", "@unit": "section"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@n": "987e", "@unit": "section"}, {"@unit": "page", "@n": "988"}, {"@n": "988a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "988b", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "988c", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "988d", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "988e", "@unit": "section"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "page", "@n": "989"}, {"@n": "989a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "989b", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "989c", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "989d", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "989e", "@unit": "section"}, {"@unit": "page", "@n": "990"}, {"@n": "990a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "990b", "@unit": "section"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@n": "990c", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "990d", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "990e", "@unit": "section"}, {"@unit": "page", "@n": "991"}, {"@n": "991a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "991b", "@unit": "section"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@n": "991c", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "991d", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "991e", "@unit": "section"}, {"@unit": "page", "@n": "992"}, {"@n": "992a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "992b", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "992c", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "992d", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "992e", "@unit": "section"}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "Loeb", "title": "Tim", "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,2644983", "#text": "Saturn"}, {"@key": "tgn,2483975", "#text": "Jupiter"}], "#text": "Cf.

Three of them are that of the sun, for one, that of the moon for another, and a third that of the stars which we mentioned a little while ago;  and there are five others besides. Now in regard to all these and those beings who either have their own motion in these, or are borne in vehicles so as to make their progress thus, let none of us all ever idly suppose that some of them are gods, while others are not, or that some are genuine, while others are of a certain kind which it is not permissible to any of us even to express;  but let us all declare and say that they are all cognate\nand have cognate lots, and let us render them due honor, not by giving to one a year, to another a month;  but to none of them let us appoint either a certain lot or a certain time in which it travels through its particular orbit, completing the system which the divinest reason of all appointed to be visible.  This first the man who is blest admires, and then he feels a passion for understanding so much as is possible for mortal nature, believing that thus he will best and most happily pass through life,\nand at the end of his days will arrive at regions meet for virtue;  and having been truly and really initiated, and won his individual intelligence, and become for the rest of time a spectator of what is fairest, so far as sight can go, in this state he continues.  And now after this it remains for us to say how many and who these beings are: \nfor we shall never be found to have spoken falsely.  Thus far, at least, I asseverate with certainty:  I say, once more, that there are eight of them, and that while three of the eight have been told, five yet remain.  The fourth in motion and transit together, and the fifth, are almost equal to the sun in speed, and on the whole are neither slower nor swifter.  These being three, must be so regarded by him who has sufficient mind.  So let us speak of them as powers of the sun and of , and of a third, such that we cannot express it in a name because it is not known;  and he is to blame for this who first beheld these things, since he was a foreigner:  for it was an ancient custom that nurtured those who first\nremarked these things owing to the fairness of the summer season which  and  amply possess, so that they constantly beheld the whole mass, one may say, of stars revealed to their sight, since they had got then, continually without obstruction of clouds and rains in the sky;  whence they have emerged in every direction and in ours likewise, after having been examined for thousands of years, nay, for an infinite time.  And therefore we should not hesitate to include them in the scope of our laws;  for to have divine things lacking honor, while other things are honored,\nis clearly a sign of witlessness;  and as to their having got no names, the cause of it should be stated as we have done.  For indeed they have received titles of gods:  thus, that Lucifer, or Hesperuswhich is the same, should almost belong to Aphrodite, is reasonable, and quite befitting a Syrian lawgiver;  and that that which follows the same course as the sun and this together should almost belong to Hermes. Let us also note three motions of bodies travelling to the right with the moon and the sun.  One must be mentioned, the eighth, which we may especially address as the world-order, and which travels in opposition to the whole company of the others, not impelling them, as might appear to mankind in the scant knowledge that they have of these matters.  But we are bound to state,\nand do state, so much as adequate knowledge tells us.  For real wisdom shows herself in some such way as this to him who has got even a little share of right and divine meditation.  And now there remain three stars, of which one is distinguished from the others by its slowness, and some speak of it under the title of Saturn;  the next after it in slowness is to be cited as ;  and the next after this, as Mars, which has the ruddiest hue of all.  Nothing in all this is hard to understand\nwhen someone expresses it;  but it is through learning, as we declare, that one must believe it.But there is one point which every Greek should bear in mindthat of all Greeks we have a situation which is about the most favorable to human excellence. The praiseworthy thing in it that we have to mention is that it may be taken as midway between a wintry and a summery climate;  and our climate, being inferior in its summer to that in the region over there, as we said, has been so much later in imparting the cognizance of these cosmic deities.  And let us note that\nwhatever Greeks acquire from foreigners is finally turned by them into something nobler;  and moreover the same thing must be borne in mind regarding our present statementsthat although it is hard to discover everything of this kind beyond dispute, there is hope,\nboth strong and noble, that a really nobler and juster respect than is in the combined repute and worship which came from foreigners will be paid to all these gods by the Greeks, who have the benefit of their various education, their prophecies from , and the whole system of worship under their laws.  And let none of the Greeks ever be apprehensive that being mortals we should never have dealings with divine affairs;  they should rather be of the quite opposite opinion, that the divine is never either unintelligent or in any ignorance of\nhuman nature, but knows that if it teaches us we shall follow its guidance and learn what is taught us.  That it so teaches us, and that we learn number and numeration, it knows of course:  for it would be most utterly unintelligent if it were ignorant of this;  since it would truly, as the saying is, be ignorant of itself, vexed with that which was able to learn, instead of whole-heartedly rejoicing with one who became good by God's help.  And indeed there is much good reason to suppose that formerly,\nwhen men had their first conceptions of how the gods came to exist and with what qualities, and whence, and to what kind of actions they proceeded, they were spoken of in a manner not approved or welcomed by the wise, nor were even the views of those who came later, among whom the greatest dignity was given to fire and water and the other elements, while the wonderful soul was accounted inferior;  and higher and more honored with them was a motion assigned to the body for moving itself by heat and chills and everything of that kind,\ninstead of that which the soul had for moving both the body and itself. But now that we account it no marvel that the soul, once it is in the body, should stir and move about this and itself, neither does our soul on any reckoning mistrust her power of moving about any weight.  And therefore, since we now claim that, as the soul is cause of the whole, and all good things are causes of like things, while on the other hand evil things are causes of other things like them, it is no marvel\nthat soul should be cause of all motion and stirringthat the motion and stirring towards the good are the function of the best soul, and those to the opposite are the oppositeit must be that good things have conquered and conquer things that are not their like.All this we have stated in accordance with justice, which wreaks vengeance on the impious:  but now, as regards the matter under examination, it is not possible for us to disbelieve that we must deem the good man\nto be wise;  and let us see if we may perhaps be able, either by education or by art, to perceive this wisdom which we have all this while been seeking;  for if we fall behind the just in failing to know it, our condition will be that of ignorant persons.  Such, then, seems our case to me, and I must say so:  for I have sought this wisdom high and low, and so far as it has been revealed to me I will try to render it plain to you.  Now the fact that the greatest part of virtue is not properly practiced is the cause of our condition, as is just now indicatedit seems clear to meby what has been said. \nFor let no one ever persuade us that there is a greater part of virtue, for the race of mortals, than piety;  and I must say it is owing to the greatest stupidity that this has not appeared in the best natures.  And the best are they which can only become so with the greatest difficulty, and the benefit is greatest if they do become so:  for a soul that admits of slowness and the opposite inclination moderately and gently will be good-tempered;  and if it admires courage, and is easily persuaded to temperance, and, most important of all, is enabled\nby these natural gifts to learn and has a good memory, it will be able to rejoice most fully in these very things, so as to be a lover of learning.  For these things are not easily engendered, but when once they are begotten, and receive due nourishment and education, they will be able to restrain the greater number of men, even the worse among us, in the most correct way by our every thought, every action, and every word about the gods, in due manner and due season, as regards both sacrifices and purifications in matters concerning gods and men alike, so that we are contriving no life of pretence,\nbut truly honoring virtue, which indeed is the most important of all business for the whole state.  That section of us, then, we say is naturally the most competent, and supremely able to learn the best and noblest lessons that it may be taught:  but it cannot get this teaching either, unless God gives his guidance.  If, however, it should be so taught, but should fail in some way to do accordingly, it were better for it not to learn.  Nevertheless it follows of necessity from our present statements, that I agree that the nature which is of this kind, and the best, should learn certain things. \nLet us try, then, to set forth in our statement what things these are, and of what kind, and how one should learnso far as our ability permits both me the speaker and those who are able to hearken\nin what manner one will learn the proper reverence of the gods.  It is, indeed, a rather strange thing to hear;  but the name that we, at any rate, give itone that people would never approve, from inexperience in the matteris astronomy;  people are ignorant that he who is truly an astronomer must be wisest, not he who is an astronomer in the sense understood by Hesiod and all the rest of such writers, the sort of man who has studied settings and risings;  but the man who has studied the seven out of the eight orbits, each travelling over its own circuit in such a manner as\ncould not ever be easily observed by any ordinary nature, that did not partake of a marvellous nature.  As to this, we have now told, and shall tell, as we profess, by what means and in what manner it ought to be learnt;  and first let us make the following statement.The moon travels through its orbit very swiftly, bringing first the month and full-moon;  and in the second place we must remark the sun, with his turning motion through the whole of his orbit, and with him his satellites.  But to avoid repeating again and again the same things on the same subjects\nin our discussion, the other courses of these bodies that we have previously described are not easily understood:  we must rather prepare our faculties, such as they may possibly be, for these matters;  and so one must teach the pupil many things beforehand, and continually strive hard to habituate him in childhood and youth.  And therefore there will be need of studies:  the most important and first is of numbers in themselves;  not of those which are corporeal, but of the whole origin of the odd and the even, and the greatness of their influence on the nature of reality. \nWhen he has learnt these things, there comes next after these what they call by the very ridiculous name of geometry, when it proves to be a manifest likening of numbers not like one another by nature in respect of the province of planes;  and this will be clearly seen by him who is able to understand it to be a marvel not of human, but of divine origin.  And then, after that, the numbers thrice increased and like to the solid nature, and those again which have been made unlike, he likens by another art, namely, that which\nits adepts called stereometry;  and a divine and marvellous thing it is to those who envisage it and reflect, how the whole of nature is impressed with species and class according to each analogy, as power and its opposite continually turn\nupon the double.  Thus the first analogy is of the double in point of number, passing from one to two in order of counting, and that which is according to power is double;  that which passes to the solid and tangible is likewise again double, having proceeded from one to eight;  but that of the double has a mean, as much more than the less as it is less than the greater, while its other mean exceeds and is exceeded by the same portion of the extremes themselves.  Between six and\ntwelve comes the whole-and-a-half9=6+3and whole-and-a-third8=6+2:  turning between these very two, to one side or the other, this power9assigned to men an accordant and proportioned use for the purpose of rhythm and harmony in their pastimes, and has been assigned to the blessed dance of the Muses.In this way then let all these things come to pass, and so let them be.  But as to their crowning point, we must go to divine generation and therewith the fairest and divinest nature of visible things, so far as God granted the vision of it to men;  a vision that none of us may ever boast of having received at his leisure\nwithout the conditions here laid down.  And besides these requirements, one must refer the particular thing to its generic form in our various discussions, questioning and disproving what has been wrongly stated;  for it is rightly found to be altogether the finest and first of tests for the use of men, while any that pretend to be tests, without being so, are the vainest of all labors.  And further, we must mark the exactness of time, how exactly it completes all the processes of the heavens, in order that he who is convinced of\nthe truth of the statement which has been madethat the soul is at once older and more divine than the bodymight believe it a most admirable and satisfactory saying that all things are full of gods, and that we have never been disregarded in the least through any forgetfulness or neglect in our superiors.  And our view about all such matters must be that, if one conceives of each of them aright, it turns out a great boon to him who receives it in a proper way;  but failing this, he had better always call it God.  The way is this\nfor it is necessary to explain it thus far:  every diagram, and system of number, and every combination of harmony, and the agreement of the revolution of the stars must be made manifest as one through all to him who learns in the proper way, and will be made manifest if, as we say, a man learns aright by keeping his gaze on unity; \nfor it will be manifest to us, as we reflect, that there is one bond naturally uniting all these things:  but if one goes about it in some other way, one must call it Fortune, as we also put it.  For never, without these lessons, will any nature be happy in our cities:  no, this is the way, this the nurture, these the studies, whether difficult or easy, this the path to pursue:  to neglect the gods is not permissible, when it has been made manifest that the fame of them, stated in proper terms, hits the mark. \nAnd the man who has acquired all these things in this manner is he whom I account the most truly wisest:  of him I also assert, both in jest and in earnest, that when one of his like completes his allotted span at death, I would say if he still be dead, he will not partake any more of the various sensations then as he does now, but having alone partaken of a single lot and having become one out of many, will be happy and at the same time most wise and blessed, whether one has a blessed life in continents or in islands;  and that such a man will partake\nalways of the like fortune, and whether his life is spent in a public or in a private practice of these studies he will get the same treatment, in just the same manner, from the gods.  And what we said at the beginning, and stands now also unchanged as a really true statement, that it is not possible for men to be completely blessed and happy, except a few, has been correctly spoken.  For as many as are divine and temperate also, and partakers of virtue as a whole in their nature,\nand have acquired besides all that pertains to blessed studyand this we have explainedare the only persons by whom all the spiritual gifts are fully obtained and held.  Those then who have thus worked through all these tasks we speak of privately, and publicly establish by law, as the men to whom, when they have attained the fullness of seniority, the highest offices should be entrusted, while the rest should follow their lead, giving praise to all gods and goddesses;  and we should most rightly invite the Nocturnal Council to this wisdom, when we have duly distinguished and approved\nall its members."}}]}}]}}}}
