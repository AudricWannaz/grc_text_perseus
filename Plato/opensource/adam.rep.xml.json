In this wide sense the word was commonly understood by\n            the Greeks (cf. Theog. 147 ); and even in the scientific study of ethics, the word still\n            retained the same wider connotation, side by side with its more specific meanings\n            (Arist.  v 3. 1129^{b} 11 ff.). The view that Justice consists\n            in doing good to friends and harm to enemies, is a faithful reflection of prevalent\n            Greek morality (Luthardt  p. 19). It is put into the\n            mouth of Simonides as a representative of the poets, on whose writings the young were\n            brought up: cf. , 325 E, 338\n            E ff.

See\n            Ngelsbach  pp. 246 ff. It is seldom that a voice\n            is raised in protest, as by Pittacus (according to D. L.

The expedition of Xerxes against Greece is cited\n            by Callicles in  in\n            connexion with the doctrine that might is right. In  the allusion is to Perdiccas II, father of Archelaus (): he died late in 414 or early\n            in 413, three years before the probable date of action of the \n              (  3), after proving himself a fickle friend and foe\n            to the Athenians during the Peloponnesian war.

There can be no doubt that he is to be identified\n            with the Ismenias who (see ) in 395 took money from Timocrates the Rhodian, envoy of the Persian King, in\n            order to stir up war against Sparta, and who in 382, when the Spartans had seized the\n            Cadmea, was condemned on this charge among others (; Plut.  5. 2). Plato\n            implies that Ismenias kept enough Persian gold to enrich himself. he was no true Greek\n            if he did not. But what is meant by saying that he had received the money of\n              ? This question has been much discussed. Possibly\n            the money of Polycrates (with allusion, of course, to the riches\n            of the Samian tyrant) was a sarcastic expression current in Athens for the\n            money of Timocrates: this is perhaps the more likely as we are informed that\n            the Athenians got no share of it themselves ( III 5. 2). Plato would\n            naturally avail himself of such a political gibe to express his dislike of a man who\n            took gold from the natural enemy of Greece ( V 470 C) to stir up not\n            war, but sedition (ib. 470 B), and withdraw Agesilaus from fighting with the barbarian:\n            for his political ideal in foreign policy was that of Cimon. See also on V 471 B. It is\n            not however likely, I think, that the present passage was written after Ismenias' death,\n            for Plato is not given to reviling his contemporaries after their death. That the other\n            three persons cited by Plato were already dead would only make his reproof of the living\n            more marked and scathing.

The natural history definition of justice (\n             IV 714 C) is here for the first time mentioned in the\n               It is to be noticed that the theory is presented by\n            Thrasymachus notin the first instance as a rule of conduct for the\n            individual, but as a political theory: his object is to describe the actual practice of\n            Greek states (338 D ff.). We are thus for the first time introduced to the  aspect of .\n            The same view of the definition is taken in  714 C ff., and it is the\n            same theory which is afterwards (in II 358 E ff.) represented by Glauco as an hypothesis\n            on which not Thrasymachus only but many others ( 358 C) explained the origin and constitution of existing\n            states: cf. also  ff. We are\n            therefore justified in supposing that the definition which Plato puts into the mouth of\n            Thrasymachus represents a theory current in the politics of the day. The conduct of\n            Athens towards her allies furnished many examples of the practical application of this\n            rule of government; and, if we may trust Thucydides, similar principles were frankly\n            laid down by Athenian statesmen in their speeches: see for example I 76. 2 , and cf. I 77. 4, V 89 and 105. 2 . It is indeed not too much to say that Might is\n            Right was the only argument by which the existence of the Athenian empire\n            could be defended before the tribunal of Greek public opinion, which regarded the\n            independent  as the only legitimate form of civic\n            life. Hence the dominion of Athens is often in Thucydides called a , from which the Spartans claimed to be liberating their\n            countrymen: see III 37. 2 , 62. 5 ff., IV 85. 6, and cf. Henkel  pp. 126128. The most conspicuous assertion of the\n            principle before Plato's time was found in Pindar's much-quoted fragment (Bergk 169 and\n            ap. Pl.  484 B)       , though it may well be doubted (with Dmmler  p. 34) whether Pindar intended to suggest any such\n            view. It is in order to refute this theory, as expounded by Glauco and Adimantus,\n            Thrasymachus' successors in the argument (see on  II 368 A) that Socrates finds it necessary to draw a picture\n            of an Ideal State (ib. 368 D ff.), so that the  theory\n            of Plato's  may truly be said to commence here.

Socrates reiterates this objection and is supported by\n            Polemarchus. It is urged by Clitophon that Thrasymachus meant by the interest\n            of the stronger what was thoughtwhether rightly or\n            wrongly by the stronger to be to their interest. Thrasymachus declines to\n            avail himself of this suggestion, and explains that, strictly speaking, rulers, qua\n            rulers, cannot err. This statement he supports by arguing from the analogy of medical\n            practitioners and others, pleading that his earlier concession was but a popular way of\n            expressing the fact that rulers seem to err. Therefore the original definition was\n            strictly correct.

In the first (344 D\n            347 E), after emphatically expressing his dissent from Thrasymachus' views, and\n            protesting against the Sophist's retractation (in the example of the shepherd and his\n            sheep) of the doctrine that every ruler seeks the good of his subjects, Socrates reverts\n            to the stricter form of reasoning to which Thrasymachus had formerly challenged him, and\n            points out that no rulers, properly so called, rule willingly: they require wages. When\n            any kind of rule, e.g. an art, is attended with advantage to the ruler, the advantage\n            comes from the concomitant operation of the art of wage-earning,\n            and not from the rule itself. Medicine produces health; the art of wages, wages; the\n            doctor takes his fee, not qua doctor, but qua wage-earner. Thus it is not the ruler, qua\n            ruler, but the subjects, as was already said, who reap the advantage. The wages which\n            induce a man to rule, may be money, or honour, or the prospect of a penalty if he should\n            refuse. The most efficacious penalty, in the case of the best natures, is the prospect\n            of being ruled by worse men than themselves. In a city of good men, freedom from office\n            would be as eagerly sought for as office itself is now.

The shepherd (says Socrates) is no shepherd, when he fattens his sheep for his\n            own gain, nor the ruler a ruler, when he enriches himself at the expense of his\n            subjects. On such occasions both shepherd and ruler are in reality professors of , an art which is distinct from that of ruling, though usually\n            associated with it. This analysis is new and valuable in itself; it also enables\n            Socrates (in 347 D) to make the first explicit allusion in the \n            to an ideal state, and to formulate what afterwards becomes a leading principle of the\n            Platonic commonwealththe reluctance of the ruling class to accept office."}, {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "katantlh/sas"}, "bibl": [{"@n": "Plat.

But  etc. should be taken,\n            not with , but as part of the parents'\n            exhortation. This yields a better rhythm, and much better sense. The parents exhort\n            their children to be just, in order that ( depends\n            on ) they may obtain the rewards\n              .

I 7. 1 with Heracl.  137 ed.\n            Bywater . Glauco's picture of the just man as one who seems to be\n            unjust is untrue to the facts of experience, as Socrates points out in X 612 D: nor did\n            even Glauco go so far as to say that the unjust man,  unjust,\n              , but only  (who may, of course, be unjust). The divorce between\n            appearance and reality is purely argumentative, and out of place in parental\n            exhortations. Further, in order to make  etc. represent what Glauco said, we should have to read : otherwise the words\n               in the corresponding phrase\n            (363 E) might just as well be omitted.

This is usually\n            explained as referring to the Theomachy ( XX 174), which\n            was caused by Zeus and Themis in the sense that Zeus sent Themis to summon the gods to\n            the council at which it was  sanctioned ( 4). But\n            (1) Themis' part in causing the Theomachy is very small, (2) the simplest and most\n            natural meaning of  is not\n            contention, but judgment or\n            decision, and (3) the Theomachy in Homer is not productive of evil\n            to men, but only to the gods themselves: its citation here would therefore be quite\n            irrelevant. W. R. Hardie (in  IV p. 182) is, I believe, right in\n            supposing that the strife of the goddesses three and Paris' judgment is meant.  and  are\n            regularly thus used: e.g. \n            ; cf. ib.\n            581,  708,  924.  644 f.\n               was the name of Sophocles' play on the\n            judgment of Paris ( 330). The poem referred to by Plato is the Cypria\n            (so also Wilamowitz  p. 367 note 46), which traced the war of\n            Troy to the judgment of Paris, and that to Zeus' deliberations with Themis ( Kinkel  p. 17.  is Heyne's emendation for : but it is scarcely open to doubt: for the marriage of Peleus and\n            Thetis, at which the three goddesses quarrelled, was an episode of the poem, and Thetis\n            could hardly therefore have been privy to the plot. See Kinkel l. c. pp. 20, 22 and\n            Jebb's  p. 153). Themis was Zeus'  (Pind. ergk),\n            and still appears as one of the Olympians in  XV 87. The Cypria is\n            quoted again by Plato in . We may fairly suppose that  was the heading of one of the introductory episodes in the poem: to\n            this also the omission of the article with  seems to point.

In Plato punishment is remedial. Ignorance or vice is in\n            the soul what disease is in the body (IV 444 C, cf. IX 591 A, B), and the judge is the\n            soul's physician (III 409 E ff., ): hence ( ff.) the\n            sinner should go before the judge as a patient visits his doctor, and we should even\n            prosecute our guilty friends and relations.

In narrating the adventures of the latter, Herodotus makes no mention\n            of a magic ring; but if such a legend had been told of the founder of the Mermnadae,\n            Herodotus is hardly likely to have ignored it. In Plato's narrative, on the other hand,\n            everything hangs on the ring. Nor is the magic ring known to Nicolaus Damascenus, whose\n            account of Gyges seems to follow a different tradition from that of Herodotus: see\n            Mller's  III pp. 382386. It is\n            therefore possible that Plato's story refers not to Herodotus' Gyges, but to some\n            homonymous ancestor of his, perhaps (as Stein suggests on Hdt. I 13) the mythical\n            founder of the family, whose name may have survived in the  (Hdt. I 93). The Gyges of history was not the first member of his\n            family to bear that name: his great-grandfather at least was also called Gyges (Nic.\n            Dam. l.c.). The resemblance between the two storiesthat of Herodotus and that\n            of Platois confined to two incidents, viz. the joint murder of the reigning\n            sovereign by the queen  and her paramour, and their succession to the\n            throne. In these two features the history of the later Gyges may well have been\n            embellished from the legends about his mythical namesake, or he may actually have copied\n            his ancestor's example. It is noticeable that Cicero says nothing to shew that he\n            identified the Gyges of Plato's story with the Gyges of history; and in a poem by\n            Nizm (as Mr J. G. Frazer has pointed out to me), where Plato\n            tells the story of the ring, the name of Gyges is not even mentioned. (See Prof.\n            Cowell's article in the , Vol. 30\n            pp. 151157. Prof. Cowell thinks Nizm became\n            acquainted with the legend through Arabic translations of the )\n            Thinking it probable, therefore, that the proverbial ring of Gyges belonged not to\n            Herodotus' Gyges, but to one of his ancestors bearing the same name, I have retained the\n            MS reading. I do not think that the suppression of the name is a difficulty, though it\n            would be easy to write (as I formerly did) . See\n              5. Such a solution would bring the text into strict\n            verbal harmony with X 612 B, with Cicero  III 38 (where the story\n            is related, not of an ancestor of Gyges, but of Gyges himself), with Lucian\n             41 and  21, and with Philostratus  101. In each of these places we hear of Gyges'\n            ring, not of Gyges' ancestor's ring. But it is better\n            to adhere to the almost unanimous testimony of the MSS, especially as in this particular\n            passage they are reinforced by Proclus. Schneider can hardly be right in supposing that\n            the older Gyges is an invention of Plato's, although in other respects his note is\n            deserving of attention: Platoni vero licebat alterum Gygen fingere, ingenio\n            et fortuna similem interfectori Candaulae, quem ideo genus ab illo ducentem facit,\n            prioris nomen, quippe quod commune ei cum posteriori esset, reticens."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "app2", "p": [{"foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "tou=ton de\\ a)/llo me\\n e)/xein ou)de/n, peri\\ de\\ th=|\n              xeiri\\ xrusou=n daktu/lion, o(\\n perielo/menon e)kbh=nai"}, "#text": "II 359 E. ."}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)/xein"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "tou=ton"}], "#text": "If (with A) we omit , the meaning must still be:\n            the corpse () <had>\n            nothing else upon it, only on its hand a gold ring, which he (Gyges) took off and went\n            out.

The images of the gods were anointed, and crowned with garlands, not only on\n            great occasions (cf. Cic.  IV 77), but also at other times,\n            according to Proclus, who remarks on this passage  (sc. ) \n              ( p. 42 ed. Kroll). Schneider aptly compares Paus. X\n            24. 6  (a sacred stone) . For other illustrations see Frazer on Paus. l.c.,\n            and Munro on Lucr. v 1199. Apropos of the present passage, Dio Chrysostom and other\n            ancient writers cited by Ast refer to the anointing of swallows by Greek women:  (so Ast: MSS )  (Dio Chr.  53 p. 276 ed. Reiske). To\n            this custom Ast supposes that Plato is alluding, the poets being as it were faithless\n            and garrulous swallows (cf. ), as\n            well as to the Pythagorean precept not to admit swallows into the\n            house (Plut.  VIII 727 B ff.), on which see Frazer in\n               V pp. 13. This explanation lends an additional\n            point to : and  might fairly be interpreted of the joyful salutations with\n            which the Greeks hailed the advent of the swallow in the spring (see e.g. Baumeister\n               p. 1985). G. B. Hussey \n              ( Vol. XXII pp. xliii\n            ff.) thinks that Plato has in his mind the wellknown  of which we read in Athenaeus (VIII 360 B ff.), remarking that\n            in the swallow song the custom seems to have been to carry some sort of\n            symbolic swallow from house to house. It is perhaps more probable (as Mr J.\n            G. Frazer suggests to me) that the ceremony of anointing the swallows and\n            crowning them with wool was performed on the children who went from door to door in\n            spring, singing the swallow song and apparently personating the swallow. But\n            the tone of the whole passage, with its air of studiously exaggerated politeness and\n            compliment, as well as the particular expressions , and , are strongly in\n            favour of Proclus' interpretation, although Plato's thoughts may have dwelt for a moment\n            on the practices connected with the  when\n            he wrote the words ."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "398B", "p": {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "kat' a)rxa/s"}, "#text": ".

So Zeller (II^{4} 1 p. 560\n            note), and many other critics, understand the word; nor can it be denied that the\n            language of Plato, , can\n            bear this meaning. Nevertheless we are bound in the first instance to interpret this\n            passage by itself, and not by Book VII, the more so as the doctrine of transcendent or\n            separate () Ideas appears nowhere else in\n            IIV, and seems to be expressly reserved by Plato for his philosophical, as\n            distinct from his musical education (see IV 435 D and VI 504 B note). What is meant by\n            the words ? The context shews\n            conclusively that  refers to copies (sc. of the\n            virtues  etc.) represented in poetry and the\n            fine arts (so also Krohn  p. 47). On any other interpretation\n            the introduction of these  is irrelevant in a\n            discussion on the rules which imitative art must obey. This being so, if  means the Ideas, Poetry will be a direct imitation of\n            the Ideas, which is inconsistent with X 595 C 598 D. Or does Plato mean to\n            suggest that Poetry and Art in his ideal city are really to imitate the Ideas directly?\n            This is a bold and attractive solution, and there are several hints elsewhere to the\n            same or nearly the same effect, but Plato expressly speaks of the  here only as immanent, and not transcendent (), and we must therefore suppose that the\n            artist copies from the life (cf.  D). The word  is repeatedly\n            used by Plato without reference to transcendent Ideas, as has been amply proved by Krohn\n              ( pp. 65, 66), Pfleiderer ( etc. p. 17), and Campbell (II pp. 296 ff.). Here it does not mean\n            varieties (as if there were more than one variety of ), but simply forms or\n            kinds, in the sense in which the immanent reality which every\n            general notion attempts to express is a form or\n            kinda genus or speciesof the totality of\n            things. Cf. IV 435 B note The genitives are genitives of definition. The use of  in the sense of immanente\n            Seinsformen (Krohn) is interesting as a harbinger of the Ideal theory of VI\n            and VIIa sort of half-way house between the Socratic  and Plato's ideas. It recurs in IV 434 D, 435 B, 437 D. See further\n            Krohn  pp. 5458, and cf. VI 504 D note But although\n            the separatists have (as I think) made out their claim that transcendent Ideas do not\n            appear in Books IIV, I agree with Hirmer ( p. 645) in thinking their deductions from this fact unwarrantable."}, {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "megaloprepei/as"}, "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": ". megalopre/peia"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)leuqerio/ths"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)leu/qeros"}], "title": "Eth.

In his\n            interesting treatise  (Landshut 1882)\n            Poschenrieder has shewn that Plato was strongly influenced throughout this passage by\n            the views of Hippocrates and his school.

The section on truth offers some serious difficulties.\n            Throughout the whole of this division of the  (377\n            A392 A) Plato is laying down precepts to which the  of poets are to conform (cf. 377 B and 392 A), and in each case it\n            is pointed out how the precept in question has been violated by Homer and other poets.\n            Here, however, nothing is said to shew that we are prescribing for the poets, and no\n            illustrations, either of our precept or of its violation, are cited from them.\n            Schneider, indeed, attempts to extort this meaning from the section; but his theory,\n            strictly understood, would require us to suppose that  in B,  in C,\n            and  in D refer not to Plato's own city, but to\n            poetical representations; that  in B is not\n            Plato's city, but any city figuring in poetry; and that  in C are not Plato's rulers, but others. Such a\n            supposition is hardly possible, if  in C is\n            genuine (see note ad loc.), and in any case it is neither natural nor obvious. It may\n            with safety be asserted that if the section had occurred in any other context no one\n            would have supposed it to contain rules for poetical fables: in itself it merely lays\n            down the duty of the lower classes to speak the truth, with the conditions under which\n            the rulers may lie. Cf. Rettig  pp. 62, 63 and notes on 389 D.\n            Rettig, following up a hint of Schleiermacher's, thinks the section was introduced to\n            prepare the way for the rulers' lie about the origin of the State;\n            while Susemihl ( II p. 120) in some mysterious way appears to\n            connect it with the theory of Ideas as the true and higher Measure of the\n            correct representation of Gods, Daemons, Heroes and the lower world. The\n            latter view is altogether fanciful; and neither of these explanations justifies Plato\n            for having inserted the passage in this particular connexion, where he is discussing\n            poetical legend, however much Rettig may extol the art with which\n            he has concealed his art. The following seems to me a more probable explanation. We are\n            professedly dealing with poetical representations of the gods and heroes, and we should\n            expect Plato to require the poets to represent them as truthful and to enforce his\n            remarks by poetical illustrations. He does not do so, because it has \n            already been done in II 382383. Instead of this, he reverts to 382 C\n              ( SC. ),\n            and emphasizes, more than he has hitherto done, the reason why truthfulness must be\n            ascribed to the gods, viz. in order to encourage the virtue among men. That Plato laid\n            the greatest stress upon the virtue of Truth appears from the fine passage in\n               730 B, C, beginning : thus it is not\n            unnatural that he should recur to the subject here. The section should be taken as a\n            kind of afterthought to 382383, which it is intended partly to explain and\n            partly to supplement. The whole section on Truth is for this and other reasons possibly\n            later than the context in which it appears: see also on , 389 C."}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)lh/qeia"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)ndrei/a"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "swfrosu/nh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)lh/qeia"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)ndrei/a"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "swfrosu/nh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "o(/ph| a)\\n o( lo/gos w(/sper pneu=ma fe/rh|"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "kalo\\s\n              ka)gaqo/s"}], "#text": "A further question has been raised as to what Plato intended by the virtue of .

The phrase  in Plato seems always to mean as\n            they say in the proverb or proverbial saying: see IX\n            573 C,  780 C, and cf. ib. 723 D. Now it is probable from the\n            position of  that  forms part of the proverb: so that the whole\n            saying may have run . (Herwerden, , cancels , but we have of course no right to take this\n            step.) The form  for  may be allowed in a pun on , especially as the Epic plural of  is sometimes found with feminine nouns. It should be remarked also\n            that the first hand in Paris A wrote  (see cr.\n            n.), though this may be merely accidental. What the ordinary application of the proverb\n            was, we cannot say: presumably it was generally employed, as here by Plato, in speaking\n            of a city divided against itself. The origin of the saying is to be sought in the\n            variety of  known as , an expression which, according to the Scholiast on this\n            passage of Plato, as well as Suidas s.v. , and\n            Hesychius s.v. , had itself also a\n            proverbial signification. In this game the abacus was divided into 60 spaces, each of\n            which was called  in ancient times (Photius s.v.\n               ed. Porson. Porson's alteration of\n               i.e. 60 into  is\n            a gratuitous change, as Schneider hints. See also Eustathius on  I p.\n            29. 13 ff., ed. Lips., quoted by Schneider). The name  was moreover sometimes applied to the game itself (Cratinus \n             3 ed. Meineke ), as well as to the  or\n               on which it was played (Pollux IX 98). There is also, I\n            think, some reason  for believing that each of the players' sides was\n            called collectively his . In Susemihl and Hicks\n               p. 148 note, Dr Jackson remarks that the words\n               make it likely\n            that a compact body of pieces was called . If we may go further, and suppose that the  of a player's side was called his , the words of Plato  receive additional point by becoming an exact\n            counterpart of the game. A defeated player, gazing ruefully at his depopulated squares,\n            each of which, as well as the whole of his side, is a city, might\n            therefore well exclaim, Cities upon cities, but no city! for there\n            can be no city without men (\n            ). I have thought of other\n            possibilities, but this hypothesis as to the origin of the proverb suits the words of\n            Plato better than any other which I can devise. For a different view see Hoffmann in\n               1863 pp. 240 ff. Cf. also Meineke  II pp. 44 f. It should be mentioned that Stewart (\n            VII p. 359) thinks there need be no allusion to the game of  in this passage, but only a jest about making one into many (cf.\n              \n            ), while Schneider finds only a\n            lusus in verbis atque in consociatione singularis et pluralis.\n            Neither of these suggestions meets the situation."}, {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "du/o -- ka)\\n o(tiou=n h)=|"}, "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "o(tiou=n h)=|"}, "#text": ": two,\n            in any case, lit. if there be even anything at all,\n            i.e. whatever there be.

In later musical theory\n               was technically used to denote the three\n            varieties of musical composition. They were called  (according to Aristid.

Plato's  need not however be confined to Aristides' three\n            varieties. On the connexion between musical and political changes see\n             700 A701 D. The connexion was recognised universally\n            throughout Greece, and particularly at Sparta, whereas Pausanias (III 12. 10)\n            tells usTimotheus had his lyre confiscated for adding to it four new strings:\n            cf. also Cic.

Wherever in the ancient Greek\n               the conception of the individual is hardly\n            separated from that of the citizen, moral and political changes are believed to go hand\n            in hand; and the effect of music on morality is explained in III 400 D401 A:\n            cf.  673 A . Bosanquet raises the question whether musical innovations are the\n            cause or only the symptoms of political. Plato, I think, regarded them primarily as the\n            cause ( ll.cc.). We can better understand their effect if we remember\n            that they were accompanied by changes not only in rhythm, but also in the quality,\n            ethical and otherwise, of the words sung; and if we also bear in mind the enormous\n            influence of the theatre in Greek life.

This is apparently the\n            earliest passage in Greek literature where the doctrine of four cardinal virtues (if by\n            cardinal virtues we mean those which make up the sum of perfect goodness) is expressly\n            enunciated. The doctrine may of course be Pythagorean, but evidence is wanting, and it\n            is doubtful whether Pindar's \n             III 74 are to be interpreted as the cardinal virtues: see Bury ad\n            loc. The nearest approach to the doctrine before Plato is in 5 (as Krohn has pointed out\n               p. 372), with which compare IV 6. 112, where\n            Justice, Wisdom, and Courage are named, as well as other virtues, including . Cf. also \n            . From other\n            passages in Plato, none of which are so precise and technical as this, it would seem\n            that  made a good fight for a fifth place:\n              , , , . In  and\n               631 C  and  (not ) are named together, without , which in the  (12 D ff.) is a\n            subdivision of . From Adimantus' ready assent\n            (cf. V 476 A note), we may reasonably infer that the doctrine of four cardinal virtues\n            was already a familiar tenet of the Platonic school. Schleiermacher thinks it may have\n            been taken over aus dem allgemeinen Gebrauch\n            ( p. 26). There is however no evidence to shew that these four\n            virtues  were regarded as the essential elements of\n            a perfect character before Plato. If the theory was originated by Plato himself, it is\n            possible enough that in restricting the number to four, Plato was not uninfluenced by\n            the sacred character of the number four in Pythagoreanism, just as Aristotle has been\n            supposed to have limited his categories to ten on similar grounds. An interesting\n            conjecture is  suggested by the remarks of Schleiermacher (l.c. p. 21). Our\n            city is  perfectly virtuous. Its constituent elements\n            are Rulers, Auxiliaries, Farmers and Artisans. Now the virtues which are exhibited in\n            the lives and mutual relationship of these classes are, as Plato holds, Wisdom, Courage,\n            Temperance, and Justice. Consequently these virtues are the component factors of moral\n            perfection; in other words they are the cardinal virtues. We may admit that there is no\n               in such a method of investigation, which is,\n            in fact, akin to the perfectly legitimate method described in : cf. also V 458 A. If this suggestion is correct,\n            the doctrine of four cardinal virtues will be directly descended from the arrangements\n            of Plato's ideal city. But it is clear from what Plato himself says, both here and in\n            429 A, 430 D, 432 B, 433 B f., that the doctrine is already an accepted part of his\n            ethical system, and not merely a provisional hypothesis which is intended to be\n            confirmed by what follows. For the relative value and importance of the four cardinal\n            virtues in Plato's way of thinking see  630 D ff."}, {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "ou)kou=n -- hu(rhme/non"}, "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e(/cis"}, "title": ["Eth.

It is undeniable that this method is much more\n            likely to lead us astray in ethics than in mathematics or the natural sciences, owing to\n            the nature of the subject; but it is valid if our analysis of the phenomena is\n            exhaustive and exact. A similar method was frequently employed in the Eleatic school:\n            see II 380 D note Plato not unfrequently extends the methods of mathematical reasoning\n            beyond what we should consider their proper sphere: the whole of the preliminary\n            studies, for example, in Book VII are to be pursued according to the methods of pure\n            mathematics.

Our  is brave because her soldiers are brave (429 B); so that in\n            describing the courage of the soldiers we have really and truly been describing that of\n            our city. But the  with which we are now\n            concerned is  in another, and more important\n            sense, being based on correct opinion (cf. , B), i.e. in this instance on\n            opinion which is in conformity with the law of the  (cf. Aristotle's \n             III 11. 1116^{a} 16 ff.), and not on\n            knowledge, like the scientific or philosophic virtue to which we\n            are introduced in Books VI and VII. In this Platonic connotation of the term,  or  is inferior both to the courage which rests upon knowledge in the\n            Socratic sense (, 196 E ff.,\n               ff.) and to that which\n            rests on knowledge of the Idea of the Good (cf.

None of these\n            references are in point; and it is simplest to take Plato at his word. He drops the\n            subject because further discussion of it would be irrelevant; he will resume it on\n            another occasion if Adimantus wishes, but Adimantus is content. Cf.

Dr Brandt's Program  (Leipzig 1890) will also be found\n            useful in studying the psychological theory here unfolded. For an attempt to shew that\n            Plato always believed in the unity of soul see ArcherHind in  X pp.\n            120131. The fundamental principle on which the theory of Book IV should be\n            interpreted is that the just soul is an image of the just city. Now the just city is a\n               with three : so therefore is the just soul. Plato states this quite clearly in 443\n            E . In this sense,\n            thereforeand to Plato it was something real and no mere figure of\n            speechthe soul has unity; but not, strictly speaking, in any other sense;\n            otherwise we are in danger of obliterating the distinction between the three orders of\n            the city, and so destroying the whole fabric. Of course nothing which Plato now says\n            should be taken as prejudging the question about the nature of soul in its , i.e. when exempt from all the evils which\n            are inseparable from matter (X 611 B ff.): if wholly separated from material accretions\n            it is probably  (612 A),  alone remaining. See on X 611 B. But for the present we are\n            concerned with soul incarnate; and Plato certainly speaks of this as having three parts.\n            Cf. Zeller^{4} II 1, pp 845 ff. In what sense an immaterial thing like the soul even\n            when present in body can be said to contain parts or\n            kinds () is a\n            further question, which Plato does not here raise, although his followers have done so.\n            It is doubtless true (as Archer-Hind holds l.c.) that parts of\n            soul can only be different modes of its operation; and a consciousness of this fact\n            seems to betray itself in 439 B, D; but we shall best apprehend the meaning of Plato in\n            this passage by treating the analogy as Plato does, i.e. as valid throughout, and\n            speaking, in common with Plato and his commentators, of parts of\n            soul.

But the\n               in VI 504 B ff., where Plato\n            expressly refers back to this passage, eschews the psychological problem altogether. The\n               of Books VIVII is in\n            harmony with the present enquiry in so far as it seeks to determine the nature of\n            Justice and the other virtues (VI 504 D, 506 A), but it is nowhere in the Republic\n            expressly used either to confirm or to overthrow the triple division of soul which is\n            here propounded. (The analysis of mental faculties in VI 509 D511 E is\n            introductory to the , not a result\n            obtained by it; nor has that analysis, strictly speaking, any bearing on the question\n            whether soul has three  or not: cf.

Krohn accordingly \n            holds that the longer ways of IV and VI are different and distinct\n              ( p. 128); and Schleiermacher supposes\n            ( p. 71) that the  of IV is to be found in the psychology of the ;\n            but that Plato meant the two ways to be identical is certain, for he explicitly says\n            that they are (VI 504 B ff.). The only way out of these difficulties is to suppose that\n               here was not intended by Plato to refer to the\n            psychological, but to the ethical question, to which the psychological enquiry is\n            introductory.  must then be taken as  (VI 504 A).

It is in itself highly probable that the most important\n            passages referring forward or backward to one another throughout the dialogue were\n            either written together, or at all events revised by Plato side by side.

Now it sometimes happens that we are at one and the same moment\n            both thirsty and unwilling to drink, in other words, experience both Desire and\n            Aversion. But Desire and Aversion are opposites. They must therefore spring from\n            different psychical elements.

Why should thirst be\n            restrained? an objector might ask. You yourself, Socrates, hold that (1) desire is\n            always of the good; consequently (2) thirst is always the desire of good drink, and (3)\n            is therefore always good.

Hermann transposes these\n            words and is followed by Stallbaum, Baiter, and others.

It is not at first sight quite easy to decide\n            between these conflicting views. The words  clearly mean that the desire of cold drink\n            is due to thirst  heat, i.e. thirst supplies the desire of\n            drink, and the heat present in the thirst supplies in addition () the desire of cold: see also on  below. This is in harmony with common\n            sense and also with the theory of \n             (sc. ) : cf.\n            also . But  seems to proceed on\n            the opposite or homoeopathic principle. The presence of  produces a desire not for its opposite but for itself.

The common sense\n            point of view is taken by Plato throughout, and is expressly justified by him in 438 E\n              . For these reasons I heartily agree with the Oxford editors.

See\n               II p. 195 or Gleditsch  p.\n            860. The single notes of a  could be called\n               because they were in reality terms in a\n            proportion and depended on the relative length of the string: cf. , C. Hartman's correction of\n               to  is very attractive: for the genitives can only be\n            explained as  etc., and the effect is\n            unpleasing, especially with \n             coming between. Retaining the Greek\n            nomenclature, we may translate: having harmoniously joined together three\n            different elements, just like three terms in a musical proportion or scale, lowest and\n            highest and intermediate, etc. In  Plato indicates (as J. and C. observe) that his threefold division of\n            soul may not be strictly exhaustive (cf. VIII 548 D note). The\n            missing faculties would thus correspond to the notes intervening between the  and , and the\n               and . It\n            will be noted that the unity resulting is not that of unison, but that of a scale or\n            mode.

His note is as follows:  (leg. ) .

The first wave\n            concerns Community of Education between the male and female Guardians (451 C\n            457 B); the second, Community in wives and children (457 B466 D); the third\n            and greatest, whose advent is long delayed, deals with the question whether Communism\n            and therewithal the perfect city itself can be realised in the world (471 C ff.).

According to Suidas\n            (s.v. ) and others, Sophron's mimes were\n            classified as  and . In the former, as may be inferred from\n            Choricius'  (first published by Graux in  1 pp. 209 ff.) Sophron represented male characters, in the latter\n            female (\n            ib. p. 215). This is corroborated by many of the titles of his plays, such as  contrasted with\n               etc. Sophron's mimes are called  (cf. ) by Demetrius\n                156 . The point here is that just as custom required an  to precede a this is not otherwise attested, so far as I can\n            discover, so it will be proper () for Plato's women to come on the stage after his men have played their\n            part. Plato's partiality for Sophron is frequently mentioned by ancient authors, as for\n            example by D. L. III 18, Quintil. I 10. 17: see Schuster in \n            XXIX (1874) pp. 605 ff., where these and other authorities are cited. Susemihl\n            (Bursian's  18741875 III p. 343) doubted whether\n            Plato has Sophron in view here; but the allusion, which was admitted by Graux (l.c. p.\n            215 note), and successfully reaffirmed by Frster (\n            for 1880 p. 472), is highly probable. I can see no point in making  an ironical reference to the\n             of Aristophanes (with Munk  p. 296, and Chiappelli l.c. p. 196), nor is it likely that\n            the words allude to a dramatic caricature of Plato's policy by some other comedian, as\n            is supposed by Bergk  IV p. 462 note 134.

The outstanding feature in his argument throughout\n            this part of the dialogue is the constant appeal which he makes to  (452 E, 453 B, C, E, 454 B, C, D, 455 A, D, E, 456 A, B, C, D). He\n            maintains that community of work and education between certain selected men and women is\n            natural in two senses. In the first place, it is, he maintains, in\n            harmony with  nature, that is, with the nature of man and\n            woman (455 E ff.), and in the second place, it is recommended by the analogy of Nature's\n            other children, the lower animals (451 D). See also on II 370 A. Phlmann\n              ( etc. pp. 114146) has shewn\n            that the desire for a return to Nature found frequent and manifold\n            expression in the literature of Plato's times, and we can see that Plato was himself\n            powerfully affected by the same impulse, although his interpretation of\n            Nature is coloured by an Idealism which is peculiarly his own (IV\n            443 B note). The special regulations of Book V may be illustrated in some particulars\n            from the practices of certain Natur-vlker before the\n            time of Plato (see e.g. Hdt. IV 116 and infra 463 C note), as well as by certain\n            features of the Pythagorean and Spartan disciplines (see RP.^{7} 48 A f. and notes on\n            452 B al.), but it is more important and relevant to observe that Plato's assignment of\n            common duties and common training to the two sexes is part of a well-reasoned and\n            deliberate attempt by the Socratic school to improve the position of women in Greece. In\n            this respect, as in many others, the teaching of Socrates inaugurated an era of protest\n            against the old Hellenic view of things. See in particular, for the views of Socrates\n            himself, ,\n             2. 9 ,\n               3. 12 15, 7. 11 ff.; for Plato,  ff. and  780\n            E ff.; and for the opinion of Antisthenes consult D. L. VI 12 . It is possible that some of\n            Euripides' pictures of noble and disinterested women were also inspired in some measure\n            by the influence of the same movement. In later times the Stoics constituted themselves\n            the champions of similar views, and Cleanthes wrote a treatise entitled : see Dyroff  pp. 311\n            314, where other evidence is cited. A learned and acute discussion on the\n            attitude of the Socratic school in this matter will be found in Chiappelli  etc. XI pp. 229 ff. Finally it should be observed that, from\n            Plato's point of view, the selection of suitable women as  is strictly in harmony with the fundamental principle of our city,\n            viz. to each one work according to his or her nature (II 370 B\n            note); that it removes a dangerous source of unrest, intrigue, and sedition, by\n            providing an outlet for the energies of able and politically-minded women in legitimate\n            channels and silencing them with the responsibilities of rule, while it at the same time\n            secures for the service of the State all that is best in the other half of the\n            population ( 781 A), and justifies the claim of the perfect city to\n            be in literal truth an Aristocracy."}, {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "kat' e)kei/nhn ktl."}, "pb": {"@n": "281"}, "#text": ": in following\n            out that original impulse which we communicated to them (D. and V.)."}, {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "w(rmh/samen"}, "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "au)tou/s"}, "#text": "(sc. ) is causative, and not intransitive, as Jowett supposes."}, {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "a)ge/lhs"}, "#text": ".

It may be argued:\n            man's nature is different from that of woman: we should therefore assign them\n            different duties. A little analysis will shew the superficial and eristic\n            character of such reasoning. The word different is ambiguous.\n            Natures may differ without differing at all in respect of the powers by which certain\n            duties are performed. Consequently, if man and woman differ only in sex, they may each\n            perform those duties in which sex plays no part. Among such duties are those which\n            appertain to the administration of a city. Doubtless man is superior, as a whole, in\n            capacity and strength, although many women excel many men; but the natural aptitudes of\n            individual women are as various as those of men, and there is no administrative duty\n            which is by Nature exclusively appropriated either to men, or to women. Thus Nature\n            produces women who are fitted to guard our city. These we shall select as the wives and\n            colleagues of the male guardians. Our proposal is possible, because it is natural: the\n            term unnatural may sooner be applied to the present condition of\n            women.", {"pb": {"@n": "284"}, "#text": "ff.

We now confront the second wave (see 449 A ff. note). The Platonic doctrine of\n            community in wives and children, as a certain critic drily remarks, has been more often\n            censured than understood. The object of the present note is not to sit in judgment upon\n            Plato, but to endeavour to explain his attitude on this subject. In its general aspect,\n            the theory should be regarded as an extreme development of the Naturalism prevailing in\n            Books IIIV: see on II 370 A f. and supra 451 C ff. Several precedents have\n            been cited from the institutions of various primitive peoples who were sometimes\n            regarded by the Greeks as types of natural societies, as for\n            example the Scythians (see on 463 C and other references in Phlmann\n               pp. 121 ff., with Newman's\n               Vol. II p. 282 and especially Riese's interesting\n            tract on  1875), and even Sparta, a State which was\n            constantly extolled by Greek political theorists as a model of the  (Phlmann l.c. pp. 125 ff., Grote\n               III p. 209 f.), furnished some parallels to the Platonic\n            communism in this respect (Plut.  15. 911, Xen.\n               1. 8, 9). But Plato's real motive in advocating his theory is\n            simply and solely the good of the commonwealth (462 A). On the one hand, he dreaded the\n            effect of domestic ties in encouraging selfishness and weakening the bonds of civic\n            obligation; and, with his customary disregard of the limitations of ordinary human\n            nature, he expected his citizens to transfer the domestic affections, without\n            surrendering aught of their intensity, from the family to the State. We may therefore\n            truly say that Plato's intention was not to abolish the family, but rather to enlarge\n            its borders and make it coincident with the State. Die\n            Sonderfamilie, as Nohle remarks (\n            etc. p. 133), wird nur aufgehoben, damit das Ganze eine grosse Familie\n            sei. On the other hand, he was profoundly impressed with the necessity of\n            restricting the population, and at the same time maintaining and improving the breed of\n            guardians, and the measures which he here prescribes are to a large extent devised with\n            a view to securing these ends (459 A461 E). In this respect Plato might\n            fairly hope that his proposals would not be abhorrent to a nation whose idea of marriage\n            was primarily only a legalised union for the procreation of legitimate children. It may\n            be argued that Plato sacrifices more than he gains, even if we judge him from the\n            standpoint of his own political idealism, but it shews a complete misapprehension of the\n            situation to charge him with deliberate encouragement of vice: the community of wives\n            and children hat mit freier Liebe nichts zu\n            thun (Phlmann l.c. p. 280). Finally, we should remember that it is\n            only the Guardians and Auxiliaries who are subject to these rules (see on III 417 A),\n            and that in the second-best city depicted in the  Plato revives the\n            institution of marriage, as we understand the word, without, however, surrendering in\n            the smallest degree his earlier ideal (807 B). Perhaps the wisest and most temperate\n            discussion on Plato's conception of marriage and the family is that of Grote\n              ( III pp. 220 234). Some judicious remarks will also be\n            found in Jowett  pp. clxxxicxciv, and Nettleship\n               II pp. 174180: but Jowett goes beyond\n            the province of the interpreter, and lays too much stress on the antagonism between the\n            views of Plato and those of modern civilised communities.

The following\n            explanations may be suggested. (1) Plato intends the community of wives and children to\n            extend only to the Auxiliaries, and not also to the Guardians. This view is taken by\n            Blaschke ( p. 10), who\n            asserts that the Rulers proper have already past the limits of age prescribed for\n            matrimony. In point of fact, however, a man may become a  at 50 (VII 540 A, B), whereas he can marry till he is 55 (460 E). (2)\n            As by far the largest number of husbands would be only Auxiliaries, Plato speaks\n            somewhat loosely, as if matrimonial community were confined to them. This explanation is\n            possible enough in itself, but fails to explain the usage in 466 A. (3)  is used with the new and deeper meaning given to it\n            in 463 B (where see note), helpers of the people, rather than in\n            its original and technical sense of the rulers' auxiliaries. This suits all the\n            passages, and is in my judgment what Plato intended.  is not the only term whose connotation deepens as the\n               proceeds: cf.

But it was a paradox in the Athenian democracy, or so at\n            least Plato, like Socrates, thought: hence  473 E. See for example 323 A and 519 D: and cf. Krohn  p. 93. Political evil is in Plato's view the result of a divorce between\n            political power and knowledge of the good; it can only be cured by effecting their\n            reconciliation. In the  Plato's remedy is to make the\n            philosopher (who is the true king) act through the statesman (305 C ff.: cf. Nohle\n               pp. 82, 88, whose interpretation\n            iswrongly, as I thinkquestioned by Zeller^{4} II 1, p. 901 note\n            5): but in the  the union between Thought and Action is complete,\n            and the philosopher is himself a statesman. Whether even then he would be strong enough\n            to found the perfect city of the , depends upon the amount of\n            resistance which he would be likely to encounter: see on VI 499 B and IX 577 A."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "473D", "p": [{"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "lego/menoi"}, "bibl": {"@n": "Plat.

The Theory was approached\n            from two directions, from the side of Mind or Thought ( Arist.  19. 990^{b} 12), and\n            from the side of Existence ( l.c.\n            Cf.

Throughout a large part of the following discussion, we are\n            not much concerned with the Ideas as strictly transcendent entities or , existing apart not only from particulars but also\n            from the knowing Mind, for it is only in so far as he knows the Ideas that the\n            philosopher-king can make use of them (cf. VI 484 C, D): he cannot possibly frame\n            political institutions on the model of Ideas which he does not know. We must admit that\n            the philosopher's apprehension of the Ideas is the relevant consideration here (cf. VI\n            484 C ),\n            but it is none the less true, and the fact cannot be too strongly insisted on, that the\n            Ideas themselves are not mere concepts of the mind, but have a separate and independent\n            existence of their own. See the Appendix to Book VII  The translation Class for\n               (Jowett) is inappropriate on many grounds:\n            Form is better: but it will be most convenient to retain the usual\n               expression Idea, although it is not a translation,\n            but a transliteration, whose unfortunate identity with the English word\n            idea is responsible in no small measure for many imperfect and\n            erroneous interpretations of Plato's Ideal Theory. The German translators mostly render\n            by Begriff. The further specifications of the Ideal Theory in this\n            passage are as follows. Each Idea is, in and by itself, one (476 A), changeless (479 A,\n            479 E), and perfect (VI 484 C, D), contrasting, in each of these respects, with the\n            phenomena which partake of or imitate it\n            (476 D note). Plato does not now touch on the question how it is that Mind has knowledge\n            of a perfection above and beyond what can be derived from observation and experience.\n            This faculty of Mind is elsewherein the  and the\n              explained by the pre-existence of the Soul.

The sailors,\n            Plato has already told us, have not the smallest idea that the true pilot must study the\n            year and the seasons etc., if he is to be truly qualified to rule a ship (that is to\n            say, from Plato's point of view, ),\n            but as for  he shall steerlet people wish him to or\n            noof  they think it impossible to acquire either\n            art or study and therewith (lit. at-once-and) the art of\n            steersmanship. We may translate the sentence thus: but art or system of  to steer, let alone whether people wish him to steer or\n            nothat they think it impossible to acquire, and therewithal the art of\n            steering. The true pilot, according to Plato, is one who knows  to steer. Whether others wish him to steer or no, is wholly\n            irrelevant; see  ff., where\n            this principle is declared to be of universal application, and illustrated as follows\n            from the case of doctors: .\n            Cf. ibid. C \n            The expressions ,\n            and  in these two passages,\n            the general drift of which is the same as Plato's argument throughout this part of the\n              , exactly correspond to , and enable us to interpret that clause, as\n            Schneider has already pointed out. Cf. also 296 E 297 B. Plato, indeed, is\n            ready to go farther still, and would maintain that he who knows how to steer is a true\n            pilot, even although he does not touch the helm (cf. ibid. 292 E). If others wish for\n            his services, it is their business to apply to him, not his to sue for the opportunity\n            of doing them a service (infra 489 B, C). A like principle holds good in the government\n            of cities, and the Platonic Socrates, though abstaining from political life, may fairly\n            claim  (). The foolish sailors, on the other hand, desire\n            only to get the  helm into their hands (488 C): how to handle it, they know\n            not, and deny that it is possible to learn (). What of ? These words should be taken closely with what goes before.\n            The literal translation is (to acquire) at once and the art of\n            steering: cf. \n            \n            this life is at once choiceworthy and good. Now to\n            acquire at once the art of how to steer () and the art of steering is merely a way of\n            saying to acquire the art of how to steer and therewith the art of\n            steering. He who learns the art and study of how to steer necessarily learns\n            therewith the art of steering (quarum qui compos factus sit, simul\n            gubernatoriam artem teneat Schneider): for  is, according to Plato, simply and solely the art of  to steer. ,\n            in short, is nothing but the  and , expressed from Plato's\n            point of view. Thus in denying that it is possible to learn either  or  of  to steer, the sailors are in effect emphatically denying that it is possible\n            to learn  in Plato's sense of the word at\n            all: cf. 488 B . So\n            much for the meaning of this passage as a whole. In regard to details, it should be\n            noted that  means how:\n               ad  spectans modum et rationem potius quam finem significat\n            (after Schneider). With Schneider also I understand  as shall steer and not shall get\n            possession of the helm.  is\n            study (in the more concrete sense of the word), rather than actual\n            exercise or practice: cf. III 402 B . With  cf.\n              ."}, "The above explanation agrees in the main with that of Schneider, and is in my opinion\n            what Plato meant to say.

Has Plato any special\n            instances in view? Steinhart ( p. 208) thinks of Anaxagoras,\n            and even of Plato himself. But it cannot be said that either of them was saved by exile\n            from deserting Philosophy, and Plato was hardly exiled, even metaphorically speaking.\n            Krohn ( pp. 117, 384) declares for Xenophon. It is however more\n            than doubtful, even after Boeckh's attempt to overthrow the tradition about\n            unfriendliness between Xenophon and Plato ( 1811), whether Plato would have gone out of his way to pay a\n            compliment to his fellow-disciple. Can Plato be thinking of his friend Dio? If so, this\n            passage must have been written in or after 367 B.C., the year of Dio's banishment from\n            Syracuse. A personal reference is easily combined with the description of a class, and a\n            tribute to Dio would be very pleasing here. I have lately found the same conjecture in\n            Thomas Gray's notes on the  See also \n             4 and (for Plato's connexion with Dio) Grote X pp. 332 ff.

Cf.\n            Stumpf l.c. p. 60 notes and Biehl l.c. pp. 5053. Plato means that as Light,\n            coming from the Sun, enables colours to be seen, and the faculty of Sight to see, so\n            Truth (or rather Trueness, as Bosanquet remarks), coming from the Good, enables the\n            Ideas to be known, and the faculty of  to know. It\n            should be carefully noted that Truth (or its source, the Idea of Good) is not yet\n            regarded as creating, but only as actualizing the faculty of Reason. The conception of\n            the Good as the ultimate cause of all Existence follows later (509 B ff.): here it is\n            represented only as the cause of Knowledge.

Just so the Good is the cause of\n              , though not itself , but (to use a Neoplatonic expression) . Plato's meaning is as follows.

As the cause of , we may, in fact, regard the Sun as the only true , for all \n            are derived from him. Similarly the Good is not \n            in the sense in which the Ideas are ; but in a\n            higher sense it is the only true , for all\n               are only specific determinations of the Good.\n            The  of the Good is merely Plato's way of\n            saying that the first Principle of all existence must itself be underived.

The one gives no account of his\n               ( in C below); the other not only does, but must do\n            so, just because he  a dialectician: cf. VII 533 C ff.

Such of his \n            as survive will be improved at each stage in the ascent, and finally, as soon as the\n            Idea of Good is reached, all his surviving \n            will actually have become perfect counterparts of the Ideas which they have hitherto\n            been only  to represent. In the meantime the , which Plato himself described dogmatically\n               in 507 A509 C, will have\n            ceased to be a mere : it will have become, in\n            the fullest sense of the term, an :\n            for the highest rung of the ladder is not reached until the entire domain of the\n            knowable has been exhausted, and shewn to be the expression of the Idea of Good.

For there is already in every man's soul an eye or , which sees or learns already; what is required is to turn this\n               round. Hence he concludes () Education is not (as the Sophists say) an art of\n            putting sight into the soul's eye ( refers to ), but an art of turning round just this very eye or  which is present in every soul from the first. The\n            prevailing view since Schneider regards \n            as anticipating and explained by, not as depending on, . This yields a tolerable sense, but makes it difficult to supply\n            the subject of , and  is also awkward. On Ast's view  explains , and the subject of  as well as the antecedent of  is at once seen to be , for it is identical with the antecedent of ."}, {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "tou= e)mpoih=sai ktl."}, "title": ["A.

The\n            most famous stereometrical problem of Plato's time was the so-called Delian\n            problem or duplication of the cube, and it is highly probable that Plato had\n            this question in his mind when he wrote the present chapter. A dramatic poet, whom\n            Valckenaer supposed to be Euripides, had already made allusion to it in the lines\n              \n              (v.l.\n              )    (Nauck  p. 676). The story runs\n            that the Delians, having been commanded by an oracle to double a certain altar, were in\n            great perplexity, \n            (Eratosthenes, quoted by Eutocius in Archimed. III pp. 102 ff. Heiberg. See also Plut.\n               7. 579 BD and \n            \n             6. 386 E f., and Johannes Philop. quoted by Sturm\n               p. 10). Plato favourably entertained their\n            application, and the students of the Academy set to work with extraordinary enthusiasm.\n            A remarkable stimulus was thereby given to the study of stereometry, and the Delian\n            problem was successfully solved. The anecdote may of course be apocryphal, but we have\n            not the smallest reason for rejecting it. The memory of such incidents is usually\n            cherished with peculiar care in the history of a College, and Eratosthenes\n            (276194 B.C.) was born only seventy-one years after Plato's death. In any\n            case the duplication of the cube may well have seemed in Plato's time a question of the\n            first importance for the purposes of stereometrical science, for, as Tannery remarks\n            (l.c. p. 256), the duplication of the square, which had already been discovered ( ff.), was believed to be the key to\n            plane problems, and so it was probably surmised that the  would give the solution of a whole series of\n            solid problems. English readers will find a short account of this classical  with some of its ancient solutions in Rouse Ball's\n               pp. 154 ff.

We have seen that the study of Stereometry, the science which deals with , naturally follows the study of Geometry, in\n            which  is investigated (526 C note).\n            Astronomy, like Stereometry, is still concerned with bodies of three dimensions, but in\n            Astronomy we have one additional element, viz. Motion, so that the study of Astronomy,\n            as Plato conceives it, is a degree more complicated than Stereometry, and forms its\n            natural sequel: cf. 528 A, B. Plato's conception of  and  would have\n            commended itself in the main to the mathematicians of his day (cf. 525 D ff., 527 A),\n            although they might not have accepted his view of the ontology of these sciences; but in\n            the two remaining subjects of his curriculum, Astronomy and Harmonics, he consciously\n            and deliberately parts company with his contemporaries (see 529 A530 C, 530\n            E531 C). After every allowance has been made for the perfervid enthusiasm of\n            Plato's style, it must be confessed that the application of the principles laid down in\n            this chapter would have checked the progress of astronomical science. Both Astronomy and\n            Harmonics are treated by Plato as branches of pure rather than applied mathematics; and\n            in each of these sciences Plato either discredits or altogether prohibits observation.\n            It must be remembered, on the other hand, that Plato's object is not to promote the\n            study of physical science for its own sake, but to provide a suitable  for those who are to crown their lives by the\n            contemplation of the Idea, from which every element of sense-perception is far removed.\n            The astronomy which Plato sketches in this chapter is a unique compound of poetry,\n            metaphysics and mathematics. Besides the powerful appeal which it makes to the poetical\n            imagination, it has a permanent value even in the  history of Astronomy as\n            a passionate protest against mere empiricism, and an emphatic if exaggerated vindication\n            of the theoretical side of the science.

These mathematical stars , i.e. in mathematical number, e.g. in\n            3 and 23 (not three , etc.), and also , i.e. in mathematical orbits, viz. the perfect\n            ellipses which are imperfectly reproduced in the orbits of the visible material planets.\n            Furthermore, although here perhaps our imagination may refuse to follow Plato in his\n            flight, just as the visible Mars in his journey carries with him the  which he contains, so Plato represents the true\n            stars of mathematical astronomy as carrying round with them , i.e. the mathematical  which are\n            in them. The mathematical counterpart of Mars, for example, will take with it in its\n            revolution those perfect mathematical forms which are imperfectly reproduced in the\n            canals and snow-caps of the visible Mars. Plato in short conceives of a mathematical\n               of which the visible heavens are but a\n            blurred and imperfect expression in time and space, just as every visible and material\n            triangle is only an approximation to a true or perfect, i.e. a mathematical, triangle.\n            The following remark of Aristotle's is intended as an objection to Plato's theory, but,\n            according to the doctrine of this part of the , Plato would have\n            accepted the criticism as containing a just and true account of the astronomy which he\n            prescribes:  ( B 2. 997^{b} 12 ff.). It remains to\n            speak of two particular difficulties. What does Plato mean by , and by ? The  seem to be generally identified with the stars and nothing more.\n            But inasmuch as astronomy deals with , and\n            the ordinary astronomer, according to Plato, studies  (cf. 533 A) rather than \n             themselves, it may be presumed that the  in reality denote the stars\n            regarded as moving bodies, i.e., strictly speaking, the movements of the heavenly bodies\n            revolving in their orbits (cf. \n            and 40 C); and the presumption becomes a certainty when we reach the words , for since the true\n               which true astronomy studies are\n            identified with the movements of true stars, we are bound in like manner to suppose that\n            the  which observational astronomy\n            studies are the movements of . Some\n            may be disposed to think that  refers to the intricate and complex patterns which the orbits of\n            the celestial bodies weave upon the Heavens: cf. \n            . But in view of expressions like \n             and \n            , it is better to hold that Plato\n            adopts the word which was usually applied to the spangles in the\n            heavens, the patines of bright gold, with which the\n            floor of heaven is thick inlaid ( V 1), and\n            uses it of the movements of the stars, especially as throughout this chapter he\n            consistently represents the visible stars which popular astronomy investigates as\n            nothing but visible or material . I understand\n               and  as the mathematical counterparts of visible stars. This\n            interpretation is, I think, the only one which gives a proper sense to , and\n            no other solution preserves in its full and unimpaired significance the necessary\n            contrast between the astronomy of observation and Plato's form of the science. The place\n            which in popular astronomy is occupied by a , e.g. the planet Mercury, and a , e.g. the planet Mars, is in true astronomy filled by  and . Plato's conception of a true science of Astronomy is a remarkable\n            product of his peculiar half-poetical, half-philosophical imaginative faculty, and\n            differs fundamentally from the theory and practice of the science both in antiquity and\n            now. But it must in fairness be allowed that if a science of astronomy could be\n            constructed on Platonic principles, admitting no element of sense-perception, and\n            dealing exclusively with incorporeal mathematical abstractions, it would prove a better\n            prelude to the study of the  () than could ever be provided by the astronomy which depends on\n            observation of the heavenly bodies.

(the account of the Good itself) . Here Socrates appears to be a trifle\n            more confident of his own expository powers, though he is careful, as before, to avoid\n               the appearance of dogmatism and therefore introduces the expression\n               etc. (cf.  l.c.) and  (cf.

The dialectical method\n            recommended by Plato in the Republic is doubtless, in its full significance, an\n            unrealised ideal (cf. nn. on  VI 510\n            B and  511 B), just as the ultimate\n            object of Dialectic, the Idea of Good, will still recede as we approach it. The\n            description which follows merely recapitulates the account already given in Book VI,\n            with a few additional characteristics already familiar in the Socratic school: but the\n            majority of the Platonic dialogues furnish practical illustrations of many essential\n            features in Plato's dialectical method: so that it is possible to form a tolerably clear\n            idea of the kind of answer which the Platonic Socrates might have made in reply to\n            Glauco's invitation.

The description of the philosopher and the philosophic city is at last complete,\n            and the argument returns to the point at which the digression\n            began, viz. V 449 A: see note ad loc. Plato has already said repeatedly, and reminds us\n            yet again in 544 A, that the aim of our whole investigation was to decide  (cf. II 368 E, 369 A notes). With the character of the\n            perfect man we are now familiar, but we have still to discover and describe , in order that we may institute our comparison\n            and pronounce our verdict. This is the task to which Plato addresses himself in VIII and\n            IX (down to 576 B). The method which he follows resembles that adopted in II 369 B\n            ff.IV. In the first place, he retains throughout the former analogy between\n            the Soul and the City, and his account of the imperfect man is in every instance\n            preceded by an account of the imperfect State. Secondly, instead of going straight to\n            the mark and giving us a single ready-made sketch of total and complete depravity, Plato\n            draws an elaborate and quasi-historical picture of the gradual descent of the perfect\n            State and the perfect Man through successive phases of ever-growing degeneration down to\n            the lowest depth of wickedness and crime. In the same way, as Nettleship observes\n              ( II p. 295), in describing a perfect state,\n            or certain steps in the process of forming a perfect state, he sometimes\n            wrote as if one step of that process succeeded another in a historical\n            order. See on II 369 B, 372 D, 373 D et al. The question has often been\n            discussed whether the sequence of polities in VIII and IX was intended to be really\n            historical or not: see for example Zeller^{4} II pp. 923925, Henkel\n               p. 56 and Krohn  pp. 204 ff. Aristotle seems to have understood Plato's account as an attempt\n            to describe the actual facts of Greek history, and severely criticizes it from his usual\n            standpoint in  E 12. 1316^{a} 1^{b} 27 ; but Plato himself\n            must of course have known as well as Aristotle that the historical development of Greek\n            constitutions did not by any means always correspond with his scheme. See Whibley\n               pp. 6288 and Greenidge  pp. 1235. The fact is that Aristotle altogether ignores the\n            real object of Plato, which is, as we have seen, to arrive at the worst State and the\n            worst man, and treats him as if he had undertaken to exhibit a full  and\n            complete genealogical tree of all the changes good or bad which had ever taken place in\n            Greek constitutional history. But Plato does not here profess to describe political\n            advance, but only political decay; and even his theory of political decay is itself\n            based upon a theory of psychological degeneration which justly and deliberately ignores,\n            as irrelevant for our present purpose, the undoubted power of human character to improve\n            as well as to deteriorate. The question, as Nettleship says, which Plato puts before\n            himself is this: The human soul being as we have described it, and having in\n            it a certain capacity for evil as well as for good, what would it come to, and through\n            what stages would it pass, if its capacity for evil were realized gradually but without\n            any abatement? In actual human experience there is always some abatement; there are\n            always counteracting circumstances which prevent any one tendency working itself out in\n            isolation and unhindered; but the philosopher may, as Plato here does, work out the\n            result of a single tendency logically. These books therefore put before us an ideal\n            history of evil, as the previous books put before us an ideal history of good\n            (l. c. p. 295). The different stages in the decline of the individual soul are each\n            reflected in the decline of the , which is\n            still, as in IIVII, not a lifeless instrument, or dead\n            machine, but in the words of Isocrates, simply the soul of the State\n              (\n             14). But although Plato treats the whole question from a\n            psychological rather than a historical standpoint, it is none the less true that the\n            materials of his picture are taken from Greek political and social life. In Books VIII\n            and IX of the  we have an extraordinarily vivid and life-like\n            embodiment of the results of Plato's observation and experience of the Greek character,\n            both private and public, in all its different phases, Lacedaemonian, oligarchical,\n            democratical or Athenian, and tyrannical; and the student of Greek history, whether\n            political, economical or social, will obtain a clearer idea of the inner life and\n            animating spirit of Greek constitutions from Plato's description than from any other\n            ancient source whatever. For the rest, it should be noted that Plato has given us in\n            this part of the  the earliest attempt at a Philosophy of\n            History, and founded the psychological interpretation of the State. Every political\n            movement is, according to him, the expression of some particular psychological impulse\n            or impulses, and the Constitution inevitably assumes different forms, according as one\n            or another element or part of soul obtains the mastery in the\n            individual citizen.

From this and other\n            indications it would appear on a first perusal that the sequence of commonwealths in\n            VIII and IX is intended by Plato to be not merely logical, but historical also; but\n            there is no question that the political evolution of Greek constitutions was far more\n            complex than would appear from Plato's description.

Although there are many points of contact between the\n            development of Greek constitutional history and Plato's arrangement, Plato here employs\n            narration primarily and chiefly as a vehicle or instrument for expressing the results of\n            psychological analysis, and not because he believes that political development always\n            and inevitably follows the same lines.

I have discussed the famous Number of Plato at length in\n            Appendix I, and must refer the reader to that Appendix for a fuller justification of\n            views which considerations of space preclude me from defending  throughout the notes. The connexion of the episode with the argument of\n            the  may be expressed as follows. In accordance with the form of\n            a historical narrative which he employs throughout these two books, Plato invites us to\n            conceive of his perfect city as having actually existed long ago, just as in the\n               (23 C ff.) and  (109 B ff.) the Platonic\n            Utopia appears as prehistoric Athens. In making this demand upon the imagination of his\n            countrymen, Plato could count upon the support to be derived from the prevalence of the\n            view that mankind had degenerated from an age of innocence and bliss in the far-distant\n            past: see the references in my  edition of the  p.\n            xxiii and Rohde  pp. 216 ff. What, then, was the originating\n            cause of degeneration? Plato finds the cause, not in anything peculiar to the Ideal\n            city, but in a law which prevails throughout the whole of Naturethe law that\n               There cannot be any\n               (to quote the phrase of Aristotle\n               E 12. 1316^{a} 12) of a perfect City; for a city which carries  the seeds of decay is not perfect, but imperfect. In\n            the sequel Plato first describes the manner in which degeneration begins to take effect\n              ( 546 A, B), and afterwards\n            proceeds to construct a Number which is the expression of that law of inevitable\n            degeneration to which the Universe and all its parts are subject. The substance of what\n            he has to say on the first head is that a psychologically inferior offspring gradually\n            makes its appearance because children are sometimes begotten inopportunely. It is\n            noteworthy that here, as everywhere in Books VIII and IX, the decline of the\n            constitution or soul of the State (543 A note) is traced to the decline of the soul of\n            the individual. In the words  (546 B, C), Plato, copying the method of the\n            Pythagoreans, and closely following their calculations, at all events in the first part\n            of the reckoning, attempts to give an arithmetical expression to the Law of Change in\n            that which he calls the .\n            According to the view which I have endeavoured to establish in Appendix I, the\n            arithmetic, in which each of the factors and processes involved was full of significance\n            to ancient speculators on the theory of numbers, may be thus expressed in modern\n            arithmetical notation: (1) 3^{3} + 4^{3} + 5^{3}=216.

In the second equation, the number 12,960,000 expresses, also in days, the\n            duration of a Great Year in the life of the Universe. Expressed in years, the number is\n            36,000, if we count, as Plato here does, 360 days in the year. The two\n            harmonies, 3600^{2} and 4800 x 2700, are the two cycles described\n            in the , each of which is a Great Year. In the first  prevails, in the second : the World waxes in the first, and\n            wanes in the second, without, however, suffering dissolution. In\n            what sense the whole number 36,000 years, which astronomers sometimes called the\n               in the middle ages, is at once the numerical Cause of\n            Change, and the lord of better and worse births, is pointed out in\n            App. I, Pt ii  7, and also in the notes on 546 C. How far Plato attached a\n            serious value to his Number and the calculations from which he derives it, I have\n            briefly discussed at the end of App. I, Pt ii. Here it must suffice to say that the\n            episode, like many other passages in Plato, is half-serious, and half-playful. The\n            setting of the whole is mythical, for it is only for literary and artistic purposes that\n            Plato pictures his ideal city as historically true: and the meaning of the latter part\n            of the Number is deciphered by the aid of one of Plato's myths. Moreover, the style of\n            the whole passage, though extraordinarily rhythmical and highly-wrought, acquires a\n            touch of fantastic humour from the bewildering parade of mathematical terms, at some of\n            which even Plato's own contemporaries would probably have smiled. On its serious side,\n            the Number affords an interesting example of the application of Number and Mathematics\n            to explain the life of the Universe and Man; and, as I have said in the Appendix, finds\n            its fittest apology in the saying . It is of some importance in the history of philosophy because of\n            its connexion with Pythagorean embryology and physics, and its employment by the\n            Neoplatonists to justify the wildest astrological vagaries. The extreme difficulty of\n            the Greek has made the Platonic  Number a favourite hunting-ground of\n            successive generations of scholars, and the works which have been written on the\n            subject, a few of which are mentioned in the Appendix, are very numerous."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "545D", "p": [{"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "a(plou=n"}, "title": ["Laws", "Pol."], "#text": ".

Consequently the arithmetical meaning of  is merely root-and-square\n            multiplications i.e. multiplications of root by square,\n            in other words cubings (thus  x ^{2}=^{3},  x ^{2}=^{3},  x ^{2}=^{3}), or , a\n            phrase which itself might well have been employed by Plato, except that he has an object\n            in drawing attention to the different stages in the process of augmentation (see App. I,\n            Pt ii  4); and partly also he wants the Muses to preserve their character as\n              . The period of human gestation is\n            therefore the first number, in which cubings make everything but cubings of what?\n            The answer is of elements which make like and unlike and wax and\n            wane. These elements are the numbers 3, 4 and 5, which measure the three\n            sides of the Pythagorean  (Procl.\n               II p. 43. 10), the triangle which,  as we are\n            informed by many authorities Aristotle, Plutarch, Aristides Quintilianus,\n            Proclus and othersPlato made use of in his Number. The antecedent of  in  is , and as  means of which 4, 3, Plato himself tells us\n            two of the numbers, and the third is also readily suggested by . 3, 4 and 5 are said to make like, because,\n            as we shall see, in the latter part of the Number, where the triangle fulfils its office\n            as a  (Proclus l.c. II p. 45. 23),\n            they produce the harmony 3600^{2}, and square numbers are  (Iambl. l.c. p. 82): they make\n            unlike because they produce  the harmony\n            4800 x 2700, and oblong numbers are  (ib.):\n            they are said to wax and wane in a figurative senseto wax in the first\n            harmony, which represents in a certain sense the waxing of the Universe, and to wane in\n            the second, which represents its wane. As the elements out of which the Universe is\n            formed, they may be said to grow with its growth, and decline with its decline. The\n            words have also a further meaning as a description of 3, 4, 5 regarded as the  of everything which exists: see App. I, Pt ii\n             5. Now the first number in which cubings of 3, 4 and 5 are present is 3^{3} +\n            4^{3} + 5^{3}=216, and Aristides Quintilianus, in the passage where he refers to Plato's\n            number, speaking of the Pythagorean triangle, remarks  ()  (p. 151 Meibom). Aristotle also in  E 12.\n            1316^{a} 58, according to Schneider's interpretation of his words, which I\n            believe to be right, informs us that the whole number of this section is 216: see App.\n            I, Pt iii.

The translation is:\n            of which, 4, 3 married with 5, yields two harmonies when thrice increased,\n            the one equal an equal number of times, so many times 100, the other of equal length one\n            way, but oblong:on the one side, of 100 squares of rational diameters of five\n            diminished by one each, or if of irrational diameters, by two: on the other of one\n            hundred cubes of three. The antecedent of  is , which I have already interpreted as the numbers\n            3, 4, 5. Of these numbers () the  i.e. 3, 4 (cf. Theo Smyrn. p. 80 ed.\n            Hiller, Proclus l. c. II p. 37 ), is married or coupled with 5.\n            That is to say, 3, 4, and 5 are multiplied together: whence we get 3 x 4 x 5=60.\n            Thrice increased is three times multiplied by\n            itself; and 60 thrice increased is therefore 60 x 60 x 60 x 60. This sum,\n            which is 12,960,000, yields two harmonies. One of the two harmonies is equal\n            an equal number of times, viz.  many times 100, in\n            other words, it is a square (cf. ) each of whose sides is a certain number of times 100 (for  cf.  in\n               I 108 E), viz. of course 36 times 100, for 60 x 60 x 60 x\n            60=3600^{2}. See Fig. 4.  The other harmony which 60 x 60 x 60 x 60 yields is a\n            rectangle (with  cf. \n            ), one of whose sides is\n            one hundred cubes of 3, i.e. 2700, and the other the number which Plato describes in\n              . What is that number?\n               means (numerical) squares\n            of (cf. Procl. l. c. II p. 38. 9 et al.): the side in question is therefore\n            100 squares ofwhat? Of the rational diameter of 5 etc.\n            Now the rational diameter of 5 is the nearest rational number to\n            the real diameter of a square whose side is 5 (Theo l. c. pp. 43 ff. and other\n            authorities). The real diameter  of a square whose side is 5 is 50.\n            See Fig. 5. AC^{2}=5^{2} + 5^{2}=50 (by Pythagoras' famous  Eucl. I 47): therefore AC=50. And the nearest rational\n            number to 50 is 7: for 49=7. Consequently 7 is the\n            rational diameter of 5. And 100 squares of 7=100 x 49=4900. But we are told\n            to diminish the 100 squares by 1 each. Do so: 4900 - (1 x 100)=4800. This side is\n            therefore 4800. The words  give us\n            an alternative way of reaching the number 4800. The construction is  = (or of 100) squares of  diameters of 5, wanting 2 each. Now the  diameter of 5 is 50. Square this and it\n            becomes 50. 100 squares of 50= 5000. Subtract 2 from each square and you have 5000 - (2\n            x 100)=4800. The two sides of the oblong are therefore  4800 and 2700\n            (one hundred cubes of three). The area is 4800 x 2700= 12,960,000\n            which is 60 x 60 x 60 x 60. See Fig. 6.

Plato was not likely to omit all mention of the most characteristic and\n            necessary factor in the establishment of a democracy, especially as he \n            introduces the same feature in describing the democratical man (561 B ).

The fact is that the\n            words do explain the origin of democracy by explaining , where the aorist is rightly used of the act by which\n            democracy is established; whereas if we read \n            the clause must be taken by itself, and then it can only express a characteristic of\n            democracy after that constitution is in force, so that its proper place would be in the\n            next chapter.

The materials for Plato's\n            picture of democracy are of course taken from Athens more than any other single city. It\n            is an extraordinarily vivid sketch; and indeed Plato's whole account of democracy and\n            the democratical man (557 A565 C), in spite of manifest exaggerations, brings\n            Athens nearer to us than almost any monument of ancient literature, Aristophanes alone\n            excepted.

Nearly all the greatest writers of Greek antiquity were on the whole\n            unfavourable to democracy, except of course the Orators: and least of all in Plato could\n            democracy expect a champion.

In  Plato is also perhaps scoffing\n            at the constant use of  in tragedy, especially by\n            Euripides:  is, no doubt, that  says! None but a \n            could have written . The poet of course really meant that tyrants gain wisdom from the\n            wise men who throng the rich man's courts (VI 489 B note); but\n            Plato maliciously twists the words into a compliment to tyrants and their rabble rout,\n            and makes them a reason for tabooing tragic poets as  (B). Cobet would omit  before\n              : but the article is necessary because  represents  of the quotation. As regards the verse itself, it was Sophocles (in his\n              ), and not Euripides, who was the\n            author: see the references in Schneider, with Blaydes on ,  311 and Dindorf on  = Nauck \n            13. Plato's error is repeated in , and the Scholiast on Ar.  l.c. remarks that Aristophanes\n            and Antisthenes made the same mistake, suggesting that either Aristophanes misled the\n            others (so also Hirmer  p. 658 note 2), or\n            that the two tragedians wrote the same line independently (so Schneider also thinks).\n            The latter supposition is unlikely. Perhaps the reduplication of the cant Euripidean\n               is responsible for a kind of error which was\n            easier in antiquity than it would be now. There is little to be said in favour of\n            Dmmler's conjecture ( p. 16), that Antisthenes had\n            quoted the line as from Euripides in an attack on Plato for associating with tyrants\n            (Dionysius I and II), and that Plato, in his hurry to reply, forgets to rectify his\n            assailant's error.

Hence the proverb , with which Plato sometimes introduces the third or culminating stage\n            in an argument, demonstration, or the like ( and\n             ll. cc.,  III 692 A,  VII\n            340 A). In the present instance there is also an allusion to the Olympic games, as\n            appears from \n            (Olympic-wise). Stallbaum conjectures that competitors at Olympia\n            were in the habit of making their third libation non uni tantum , sed sicuti consentaneum fuit, : but\n            there is no authority for this idea.

Gardner in  I p. 217, where the evidence is\n            quoted)? Schneider takes this view: but the words  below make it clear that the reference is only to wrestling. The\n            point manifestly is, that as in wrestling the third throw decided the contest between\n            two athletes (Schol. on \n            et al.), so here the  wins after he has thrice\n            defeated the  (cf. also ).

Compare \n            . Plato adds the epithet \n            : in an Olympic contest Zeus Soter is also in the truest\n            sense Olympian too, although in banquets Zeus Olympius received only the first, and not\n            also the third libation. With similar and even greater emphasis on the word  Pindar prays for an  victory\n            for Phylacidas in the words \n                ( l.c.: see Donaldson ad loc.)."}, {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "ou)de\\ panalhqh\\s -- kaqara/"}, "pb": {"@n": "349"}, "title": ["Psyche", "Lect. and Rem."], "#text": ".

That the reading of the MSS is corrupt has been\n            admitted by the majority of critics, and will be proved in App. VI, to which I must\n            refer for a full discussion on the text and interpretation of this difficult passage.\n            Here it is possible only to set down what seems to me, after a review of all the\n            conditions of the problem, the least unsatisfactory solution. The emendation in the\n            text, which I printed in my , has been approved by a\n            critic in  XXIV p. 252. We have to discover whether food, drink\n            etc. participate in pure Being more than true opinion, knowledge etc.; and the answer is\n            arrived at by the following steps. (1) Which \n            morethat which is connected with the ever-like, the immortal and Truth, and\n            which is itself of this nature, and found in something of this nature; or that which is\n            connected with the never-like and mortal, and which is itself of this nature (never-like\n            etc.) and found in something of this nature? That which is connected with the ever-like,\n            says Glauco,  more. (2) Then does the Being of the -like (= )\n            participate in Being at all more than the Being of Knowledge does? Certainly not\n              ( is strictly illative: if it is true that what\n            is connected with the ever-like  more than what is connected\n            with the never-like, then the Being of the never-like cannot \n            more than Knowledge isfor Knowledge of course . Knowledge is in short taken as a type of that which\n              ). (3) Or has the Being of\n            the never-like more part in  than Knowledge has? To this also the\n            answer is no: [for that which is connected with the ever-likeand Knowledge is\n            sois connected also with Truth: see above ]. (4) And if it has  part in truth [as it has], it must also have less part in\n            Being. [This deduces from step (3) the conclusion already implied in (2), and also paves\n            the way for ]. (5)\n            Thussince what is true of Knowledge is true of  the\n            spiritual , [and since food etc. are of course only\n            particular examples of the  or\n            never-like], universally () those  which are concerned with the care of the body have less\n            part in Being and Truth than those which are concerned with the care of the soul.

His motive in introducing this\n            hedonistic calculus, as Bosanquet calls it, has been much\n            discussed. The following considerations deserve attention. (1) On artistic grounds, now\n            that the argument has been concluded, it is not inappropriate that Justice and\n            Injustice, represented by the  King and the Tyrant, should as it were be\n            weighed in the balance. The importance of  is constantly present to Plato's mind. See on X 602 D. (2) The\n            Pythagoreans were in the habit of expressing virtues and other immaterial ideas in terms\n            of numbers (see Zeller^{5} I pp. 389 ff.), and there is reason to suppose that the\n            number 729 played a part in a Pythagorean calendar (588 A note). Some of the terms\n            employed by Plato, such as , are also in\n            all probability of Pythagorean origin. See App. I to Book VIII pp. 279 ff.

(4) When all is said we must allow that some of the steps are arbitrary,\n            and that Plato's main object is to reach the significant number 729, so as to indicate\n            that the king has more pleasure than the tyrant every day and every night of his life.\n            There is of course an element of playfulness in the episode, and we need not suppose\n            that Plato set any particular store by his calculations: but neither ought we on the\n            other hand to dismiss the whole reckoning as a meaningless and foolish jest.

What does Plato mean by ? It is\n            surely something more than harmlose populr-theologische\n            Redeweise (Pfleiderer  etc. p. 33).\n            The poet Gray (who aptly reminds us of Diogenes Laertius' epitaph on Plato    III 45) remarks\n              , that is, in the idea of the\n            divinity: see the beginning of the following book. Apparently he understood\n            the words of the Heaven of Ideas, a view which has, with various modifications and\n            qualifications, found favour also with other critics (see Steinhart\n             p. 254 and cf. Susemihl  II p. 248\n            ff. Proclus  269 E seems to interpret the  as , but Plato is manifestly speaking of the ). Others have taken  of the Weltall or\n            Macrocosm, as if the Universe itself were one great ideal city, after whose pattern we\n            should regulate the City of the Soul (see Steinhart l. c. and p. 270 with , 90 D); but, as Schneider points\n            out, we can hardly reconcile such an interpretation with VII 529 C530 C, and\n               is also against it. The sentence may be\n            compared with ,\n             713 B ff. and especially 739 D, E, where the polity of the\n               is thus described: . We might employ this passage to explain , but its tone is less elevated\n            and impressive, and in particular it does not help us to understand . Plato's language is\n            extraordinarily suggestive, and I confess that to me, as apparently to Susemihl (l. c.\n            p. 249), these words suggest, not indeed the doctrine of Anamnesis in all its bearings,\n            but something of the half-religious, half-poetical atmosphere with which Plato invests\n            that doctrine in the  The mysterious and haunting phrase\n               recalls the\n            imperial palace whence we came, and the whole sentence reminds us\n            once again of that profound and inspiring doctrine , which, as I have often pointed out,\n            underlies so much of Platonism. The sister-doctrine of Immortality seems also to be\n            implied, and from this point of view the Christian parallels are highly remarkable and\n            significant: see for example  3. 30 , and many other passages in the\n            New Testament, e.g.  11. 16, 12. 23, 13. 14: 1 \n            i. 4, 2. iii. 13.

Hirmer  p. 623). It is in no sense, as supposed by Schleiermacher\n              ( p. 55) and apparently also by Hirzel ( I p. 237 note), a fulfilment of the promise held out in III 392 C; nor\n            ought we to construe  III 394 D as a hint that the subject of Poetry is to be resumed: see\n            note ad loc.

The chorizontists (such as\n            Siebeck  pp. 142 ff., Pfleiderer  etc. p. 34 and Brandt  p. 27), relying partly on the tone of the\n            exordium, partly on  607 B, assert that\n            Plato is replying to certain comic poets (Pfleiderer), or to Antisthenes (Brandt), who\n            had presumably fallen foul of Plato's treatment of Poetry in Books II and III.

The Platonic dialogue, like actual conversation, is at liberty to recall,\n            modify, and expand the results of a discussion apparently finished (cf. Hirzel l.c. pp.\n            228230, 236); and we have already had an incidental recurrence to the subject\n            of Poetry in VIII 568 AD.

He may well have wished to do so: for his\n            dethronement of the great educator of Greece (606 E) would be sure to arouse wide-spread\n            hostility, and Plato almost seems to feel that it needs further justification even to\n            himself (595 B note).

Grimmelt  pp. 81 ff., Hirmer l.c. pp. 646 ff. and Dmmler  p. 14), and it is exactly the same reason\n            which makes him cite Ideas of concrete and artificial objects in Book X. The view that\n            Plato should not be taken seriously is as old as Proclus, who ( 104 F) observes , but, apart from other considerations, the\n            recurrence of the same form of the theory in other dialogues (see on 596 B, C) justifies\n            us in taking Plato here also at his word. The history of the controversy is ably\n            reviewed by Dr Beckmann (, Bonn\n            1889), with whom and with Zeller^{4} II pp. 666, 701 al. I agree in believing this\n            passage to be an authoritative exposition of the Ideal theory on one of its many sides."}, {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "ei)=dos ga/r pou ktl."}, "hi": [{"@rend": "italic", "#text": "one"}, {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "might"}, {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "did"}], "title": "Pl.\n            St.", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ei)=do/s ti"}, "bibl": {"@n": "Plat.

Bury in  VIII p.\n            299), but for Plato , strictly interpreted, is the\n            Ideal World. Plato's nomenclature is in harmony with the traditional usage of Greek\n            philosophy, for in Greek philosophical language,  always means that which is primary, fundamental, and persistent, as\n            opposed to that which is secondary, derivative, and transient (Burnet\n               p. 11). Now in Platonism the primary, fundamental,\n            persistent, is the : and hence the  or nature of anything means its\n            Idea (e.g. \n            ), and\n            the  or nature of \n            things () becomes an expression for the World of\n            Ideas (regio idearum,  Schneider).

But, if God and\n            the Idea of Good are the same (see on VI 505 A ff.), Plato is merely saying in\n            theological language what he formerly said in philosophical, when he derived the\n               of all other Ideas from the Idea of Good (VI\n            509 B).

Yet the highest art has in every age claimed to portray, not the\n            so-called actual, but the Ideal: see for example Arist.  25. 6 and\n            17: It may be impossible that there should be men such as Zeuxis painted.\n            Yes, we say, but  (Butcher's translation), and the recent development\n            of this idea by W. J. Courthope,  pp. 152,\n            165, 196 ff. and passim. In the present passage, Plato bases his unfavourable verdict on\n            what must be admitted to be a narrow and scholastic interpretation of his own ontology,\n            but in view of Books II and III as well as 605 C 607 A below, we can hardly\n            doubt that his attitude was determined in the first instance by educational rather than\n            by metaphysical considerations, and that throughout the whole of Book X he was thinking\n            less of the inherent possibilities of Art, than of actual Greek Art and Poetry\n            considered as the exponents of a moral and religious creed which Plato himself\n            emphatically disowns. See also on 607 A. In any case, the objections which he here urges\n            do not touch the real essence of any form of Art except pure and unadulterated realism.\n            Elsewhere throughout the Platonic writings there are not wanting indications of a juster\n            estimate of the artistic faculty and its possibilities (see for example III 401\n            B403 C, and especially V 472 D, and cf. Walter  pp. 441 ff., 459 ff. and Sthlin  pp. 5665), and the sympathetic student of Plato\n            will find it easy to construct a nobler and more generous theory of Aesthetic Art out of\n            the doctrine of Ideas together with its corollaries of  and pre-existence. It is also a historical fact that Plato's own\n            conception of a transcendent self-existing Beauty,  (), has proved an inexhaustible fountain of\n            inspiration to some of the greatest artists, notably, for instance, in connexion with\n            the Platonic Academy at Florence in the days of Michel Angelo: see Symonds,\n               II pp. 205, 207, 247, 323 ff.

On the strength of these two facts\n            Sthlin has evolved the ingenious theory that Plato's motive throughout this\n            part of the discussion is a purely polemical one, and that he did not seriously consider\n            Poetry only third from Royalty and Truth.

It is not necessary to suppose that Plato has any individual person in\n            his mind: there must have been many such apologists of Homer and dramatic poetry in\n            Plato's day, and Plato as usual individualizes the type. See for instance the\n             of Plato and  ff. It will, no doubt, help us to appreciate Plato's attitude towards Poetry\n            if we remember that she was the  rival of Philosophy, and\n            that (as Munk observes,  pp. 313\n            ff.) the  is in a certain sense a demand that Philosophy shall\n            take the place which Poetry had hitherto filled in educational theory and practice: see\n            especially the address to poets in  817 A ff.

In any case the reference ought not to be thus limited, nor ought we to\n            suppose (with Dmmler and Sthlin, ll. cc.) that Antisthenes alone is\n            intended, for Plato seems to be alluding to a tolerably widespread view and one which\n            was freely represented in Apologies of Poetry. Understood in its full significance, the\n            theory of Poetry which Plato is here combating requires us to believe that a poet who\n            can represent a general, a pilot etc., knows the art of generalship, pilotage etc. (cf.\n            599 C ff.), and we are told that Sophocles was actually made  because of his  (see the Argument\n            ascribed to Aristophanes the grammarian). If we realise the part which Poetry, and\n            especially the poetry of Homer, played in Greek education, and remember that\n            Aristophanes makes Homer the teacher of , it is by no means extra vagant to suppose\n            that such views were actually maintained in Plato's time, though Pericles for example\n            had a different criterion of strategic ability when he told Sophocles that he\n            knew how to write poetry, but not how to command an army ( Athen. XIII 604 D). Cf.  540 B542 B\n            and Sthlin  etc. p. 23 note 3. The\n            public, remarks Sthlin, whose views Plato here combats,\n            allowed the authority of the poets to extend even to the domain of the particular arts.\n            It was Plato who broke through this magic circle which surrounded Poetry.\n            Aristotle followed in the same path, refusing to allow that a mistake in respect of some\n            particular art is necessarily a flaw in the poetry: see  25.\n            1460^{b} 20 ff., 33 ff. Plato himself, of course, holds that poets are destitute of\n            scientific knowledge, and compose their poems \n            : cf. also ,  533 D\n            ff.,  719 C and .

This view of Poetry\n            is of course earlier than Plato: we meet with something like it in a striking fragment\n            of Democritus ap. Dio Chrys. LIII 274 (quoted by Sthlin l.c. p. 12) , and Pindar likes to represent himself as the inspired mouthpiece\n            of the Muses and Apollo. We cannot attain to a correct conception of Plato's aesthetic\n            unless we are careful to remember that, although he refused to allow that the poet has\n            knowledge, he did not deny him genius and inspiration.

Plato and Aristotle\n            agree in holding that Pity is one of the principal emotions to which Tragedy ministers.\n            The point at which they part company is where they begin to discuss the effect produced\n            upon human life and conduct by the indulgence of this emotion in the mimicry of the\n            stage. According to Plato, the emotion grows by what it feeds upon, and becomes more and\n            more troublesome and deleterious in real life, the more we indulge it at the theatre:\n            according to Aristotle, tragedy effects the purgation of pity and\n            its kindred emotions and tends to free us from their dominion in matters of more serious\n            moment ( 6. 1449^{b} 27 et al.). Aristotle hopes to effect by means\n            of theatrical stimulation what Plato would attain by starving the emotions even in play.\n            It is obvious that the Aristotelian theory of the drama was in this important respect\n            developed in direct and conscious antagonism to the Platonic, to which, in other\n            particulars, it owes much: see Finsler  pp. 96\n            ff.

Socrates has already expressed his belief in the immortality of the soul in VI 498\n            D: cf. also ib. 496 E and I 330 D, E. The proof which Plato gives here has been widely\n            discussed and severely, though often unfairly and unintelligently, criticised by many\n            critics, to some of whom reference is made in the  course of the notes.\n            Plato does not stop to define what he means by soul, nor the\n            different senses in which he employs the word death, and the\n            consequence is that superficial inspection of his reasoning often sees a fallacy where\n            there is only an ellipse. The best preparation for a study of this argument is a careful\n            examination of the proofs in the , to which Plato himself appears\n            expressly to allude in 611 B: see note ad loc. It will be easier to understand the\n            reasoning of Plato if we bear in mind the following considerations. (1) The duality of\n            soul and body is assumed throughout the whole discussion. (2) It is the individual\n            immortality of the soul which Plato wishes to prove. (In his excellent monograph , Halle, 1878, Bertram appears to me\n            to have conclusively and once for all established this point as against\n            Teichmller  pp. 123. Cf. Simson\n               pp. 126143). (3) The\n            conception of soul as the principle of life, though not expressly enunciated here, is\n            present to Plato's mind (609 D note). The question whether immortality (in the fullest\n            sense of the term) belongs to the entire soul, or only to part of it, is not raised in\n            the course of the proof itself, but from 611 B612 A, it would seem that the\n               alone is indestructible (611 B note). At\n            each successive incarnation the  is defiled\n              , and (according to\n               ff.) the pollution\n            frequently adheres even after death, causing the soul to seek re-incarnation. The\n            ultimate aim is apparently to be delivered from bodily existence altogether, and live\n               (), but\n            even then the soul would notso at least I thinkseem to Plato to\n            lose its essential individuality and become absorbed.

It would surely be more true to hold that vice is able to kill\n            the soul just  it is able  (609 B), and Panaetius actually made use of a similar\n            argument in order to prove the soul mortal (nihil esse, quod doleat, quin id\n            aegrum esse quoque possit. quod autem in morbum cadat, id etiam interiturum; dolere\n            autem animos, ergo etiam interire Cicero  I 79). Is\n               intended as an\n            appeal to experience? Even if we allowed that experience is the proper tribunal, our\n            experience of the effect of injustice on a human soul is limited to a single life; and\n            why should not one soul wear out many bodies and perish at last through its own vice\n              \n            (cf. , 91 D. See also\n            Deichert  pp.\n            4648). These difficulties are serious, and possibly fatal: they have even led\n            some critics to stigmatise the whole argument as a  (e.g. Brandt \n            p. 29). Plato does not attempt to solve them here; but  a comparison of the\n            present argument with 94 B helps at all events to explain his position. Soul is always\n            soul, and no soul is more a soul than any other (); hence the soul which is made evil by vice\n            retains its vitality unimpaired. It is in fact the conception of soul as the principle\n            of life which explains (from the Platonic point of view) Glauco's emphatic . Cf. I 353 D , with note ad\n            loc. It is on the essential connexion between soul and\n            life that Plato builds his crowning argument for the immortality\n            of the soul in the  (100 B ff., and especially 105 C, D).

It will facilitate the study of the details if we\n            observe in advance that Plato's description falls into two well-marked divisions or\n            sections, viz. from  down to\n               (616 B, C), and from  (616 C) to the end of the myth.

The following remarks will indicate the kind of reply which seems to\n            be in harmony both with Plato's general attitude on astronomical questions and with the\n            special peculiarities of the myth before us. (1) The visible heavens, according to the\n              , are not the object of true Astronomy. The true Astronomer is\n            concerned with  (VII 529 D. See note ad loc.). We may\n            therefore expect imagination and idealism to play a large part in Plato's astronomical\n            pictures, more especially when they form part of a myth. (2) The greater portion of this\n            passage is in reality a similitude representing the celestial system under the figure of\n            the spindle of Necessity.  Now it is clear that Plato deliberately\n            sacrificed the reality of the sidereal sphere when he found it inconsistent with the\n            figure which he had chosen (see on  616 D).\n            And if he could concede so much to his comparison, the question arises, Are\n            we justified in regarding  of the machinery as seriously\n            expressing Plato's real conception of the mechanism of the heavens? It will\n            be found on reflection that the only satisfactory and safe reply is that all the\n            machinery, including the material whorls and axis of the spindle, is poetical\n            throughout. This does not of course exclude the supposition that some of the details of\n            Plato's imagery are borrowed from earlier astronomical fancies, and it is highly\n            probable that here, as elsewhere in the myth, he takes something from the Pythagoreans:\n            see on 616 C, D, 617 B. (3) The entire description should in all probability be regarded\n            as essentially a symbolic representation and not an attempt at scientific\n            explanation (Cook Wilson). But a symbolic representation should\n            stand in some relation to the thing signified, and in this case all we can\n            reasonably infer from Plato's symbolism is that, according to his belief, the Earth is\n            in the middle: the Sun, Moon and Planets revolve round the Earth at different distances\n            from the centre and with different velocities, participating in the general movement of\n            the heavens and at the same time having a contrary movement of their own. As for the\n            fixed stars, it would seem from the first part of Plato's description that he supposed\n            them to be fixed in the outermost sphere of the Universe, round which he plainly\n            supposes that the circle of the Milky Way extends.

As regards the shape and position of the light, Plato's\n            language is clear and precise. The light is straight, like a\n            pillar, and stretched through all the heaven and earth.\n            The only natural interpretation of these words is that a column or shaft of light spans\n            the entire Universe, like the diameter of a circle, and passes through the centre of the\n            Earth, which, according to Plato, is situated in the middle of the whole ( ff., ). With  we may compare \n             (of the axis of the\n            Universe). The words \n            refer, not of course to the shape, but to the colour of the light, as appears from\n              . The correction of\n               to  in A (see cr. n.) is late, but  is intrinsically a better reading, and might easily have been\n            altered to  under the influence of .

The pronoun  is ambiguous, and as far as concerns the grammar might\n            be referred either to  or to . If we choose the former alternative,  will be an objective genitive, denoting that which is\n            bound; if the latter, the meaning, as Professor Cook Wilson points out, is\n            its chains, its bands, i.e. the\n            chains of which the light consists, for in the next clause the light is said\n            to be a chain (). The second of these views is\n            on grammatical grounds somewhat more natural than the first; but whichever alternative\n            we adopt, it is clear from the explanatory clause , not only that the chains are the binding chains\n            of heaven, but also that it is the light itself, and nothing else, which fulfils the\n            function of binding the Universe together (). In what way the light performs this office,\n            Plato indicates by the much-disputed words . The evidence on the subject of the\n            undergirders of ancient men of war has been collected and\n            discussed by Boeckh  pp. 133138: see also J. Smith  pp. 210215 and Breusing  pp.\n            170184. It may be taken as established that the  were ropes and not planks, as some of the ancient commentators\n            supposed (e.g. Proclus  II p. 200. 25, a Scholiast quoted\n            by Kroll l.c. II p. 381, and Suidas S.V. ,\n            who follows a scholium on ), and also that they were fastened round the \n            of the vessel; but on the question whether the  ran round the ship in a horizontal direction, or were passed\n            under the hull, there is more room for difference of opinion. The former view is\n            maintained by Boeckh and Breusing, the latter by J. Smith (l.c. pp. 108 f., 115,\n            210215), who reminds us that a similar process, known by the name of\n            frapping, is still occasionally resorted to in the case of wooden\n            ships during a storm at sea (pp. 108 f.). The evidence bearing on this matter has\n            recently been investigated by Professor Cook Wilson (see Report of the Proceedings of\n            the Oxford Philological Society for Hilary Term 1902 in  XVI p.\n            234), who will shortly publish a detailed discussion of the whole subject. In the\n            meantime he writes to me as follows:After careful reading of all\n            the passages quoted by the authorities I feel sure (what one might infer  from the mechanical conditions) that this\n            method [i.e. frapping] was known to the ancients, and was the\n            method used in an emergency at sea, as e.g. in St Paul's ship. I conjecture also that\n            these undergirders first had the name , and\n            that if the belts or girdles supposed by Boeckh had this name, it was transferred to\n            them from the true undergirders, which were probably the first and primitive form and\n            remained in use always, even after the trireme belts had been invented. The\n            evidence in short, points to two kinds of \n              (\n            \n             l.c.), the first employed occasionally under exceptional\n            circumstances, and passing under the hull of the vessel, the second (see Boeckh l.c. p.\n            137) forming part of the regular equipment of a warship, attached before she went to\n            sea, and running horizontally round the hull. The second variety is clearly represented\n            on a bronze relief of the forepart of a war vessel, said to date from Roman imperial\n            times, and now in the Berlin Museum. The sketch of the relief on p. 443, fig. ii is from\n            a photograph in the possession of Professor Cook Wilson. There is also a (somewhat\n            inaccurate) drawing of the relief in Beger  Vol. III p. 406. (Some writers, and among them J. Smith, have\n            maintained that the longitudinal bands in Beger's picture are only ornaments, and not\n            ropes; but it is quite clear from the photograph that they are really ropes and serve as\n               of the horizontal kind.) To which of the\n            two varieties does Plato here allude? The words , seem\n            clearly to regard the  as permanent  of warships, holding the hull together in ordinary\n            circumstances, and not merely resources to be employed in times of difficulty and\n            danger; and since the light whose action the \n            serve to illustrate is (in Plato's view) an essential part of the Universe, the\n            illustration is better and more pointed if the  are also of the more permanent sort. It may also be noted that if\n            Plato had meant the undergirders which pass under the keel he would probably have\n            written , and not , for the vertical  were not confined to triremes. For these reasons it\n            would seem that Plato has in view such  as\n            are described by Boeckh, viz. girdles running round the hull from stern to stem outside\n            the vessel."}, "It is clear, therefore, that the light not only passes through the centre of the\n            Universe, but also, since it holds the heavens together, like the undergirders of men of\n            war, round the outer surface of the heavenly sphere.", {"hi": [{"@rend": "italic", "#text": "dd'"}, {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "b"}, {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "c"}, {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "caba'c"}, {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "cab"}, {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "ca'b"}, {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "Plato's"}, {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "bc"}], "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "u(pozw/mata"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "u(pozw/mata"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "u(pozw/mata"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "u(pozw/mata"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "u(pozw/mata"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "u(pozw/mata"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "u(pozw/mata"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)/kra tw=n desmw=n"}], "#text": "I have tried to represent the kind of picture in Plato's mind by fig. i on p. 443.

The circular\n            light  corresponds to the ,  being that part of the light which\n            corresponds to the  on the port side, and  the portion which corresponds to the  on the starboard side. As the light in Plato's description\n            passes through the centre of the Universe as well as round its exterior, the comparison\n            of the light to horizontal  would be all the\n            more apposite if we might suppose that these \n            were brought inside from stem to stern lengthwise and parallel to the ship's length, in\n            a manner corresponding to the position of the straight part of the binding\n            light.

The shaft and hook thereof are made of adamant, and the\n            whorl partly of adamant, and partly of other materials. With this sentence we\n            pass to the second part of Plato's description, in which he tries to depict the\n            movements of the celestial bodies by a new imagethat of Necessity and her\n            spindle. Regarded in itself, this image is tolerably clear and coherent, if we are\n            willing to allow a large admixture of supernatural mechanics; but Plato fails to shew\n            how it is to be reconciled with what has just preceded, and no one has hitherto\n            succeeded in effecting the reconciliation, without doing violence to the Greek. See on\n            616 D, E and App. VI. The rapid imagination of the writer has already escaped from the\n            earlier picture and fallen under the spell of a new conception, and we shall best\n            apprehend his meaning if we consider what the peculiar nature of that conception\n            demands. The ordinary spindle was shaped somewhat as in figure iii on p. 444, in which\n               is the shaft, and  the whorl.\n            (There is no hook in the figure: but its position would of course be at ) The fibres were attached to the hook and twisted into a thread\n            by the revolutions communicated to the spindle by the finger and thumb: see\n            Blmner  etc. I pp. 109120, from whom the\n            figure is borrowed. It is essential to the notion of a spindle that the hook should be\n            fastened to the fibres which are to be spun. For this reason Plato finds it necessary,\n            in using the similitude of a spindle, to attach the hook () to something which may correspond to the fibres; and he\n            accordingly fastens it to the ends of the chains of light depending from the heavens in\n            his previous image, at the point where these ends meet the ends from below, . If we treat this construction as a piece\n            of serious mechanics, Plato's device is open to many obvious criticisms. In fastening\n            the spindle to the  from above, he\n            forgets or ignores the ends from below. It will further be observed that he says nothing\n            about the direction of the spindle: it is merely stretched from the\n            ends of the chains. We shall presently see that the shaft of the spindle\n            symbolises the axis of the Universe, so thatif we are to connect the two\n            images in Plato's mind it is natural to suppose that the spindle extends\n            downwards, following the line of the light. Here again there are difficulties, the most\n            serious of which perhaps is that, as the axis of the Universe must go through the earth,\n            the effect of attaching the spindle at the middle of the light\n            will be to depress the earth itself below the centre of the whole. But it should be\n            remembered that Plato's object in this passage is not to furnish a scientific account of\n            the celestial mechanism: see below on 616 D, E, 617 A. We are dealing with a work of\n            literature and not of science, and the machinery of a myth ought not to be rigorously\n            scrutinized from the scientific point of view. Inconsistencies of this kind are found to\n            be inseparable from such poetical representations of the Universe. In the present case\n            they arise chiefly from the juxtaposition of two essentially irreconcileable\n            conceptionsthat of a sphere girdled and traversed by light, and that of\n            Necessity and her spindle. See on 616 D, E. For the rest, it should  be\n            noted that adamant symbolises  (cf. Proclus l.c. II 209. 22), and is the appropriate material for\n            the , since in Plato's picture the  stands for the axis of the whole.  is not elsewhere found in the sense of the shaft of a\n            spindle: ordinarily it means distaff. See on 616 D, E below.

In order to suit his image of the spindle\n            and whorl, Plato apparently takes these Pythagorean spheres, and cuts them in half,\n            producing a series of hemispheric cups or whorls, in the circular\n            lips of which the celestial bodies are fastened or bound (, says Theo 150. 14 Hiller: cf. also Proclus l.c.\n            219. 24)."}, {"foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pa=san sune/xon th\\n\n              perifora/n"}, "title": "Republic.", "#text": "So far as the Sun, Moon and Planets are concerned, the resulting picture is clear and\n            intelligible, but it is impossible to conceive of the fixed stars as occupying the\n            lip of one of the hemispherical whorls in the way in which the Sun\n            for example may be supposed to do so. Whatever view we hold of the rest of the picture,\n            it is likely that in this particular at least Plato himself did not think his comparison\n            adequate to exhibit the phenomena: for in C above he has already represented the\n            outermost heavens, in which dwell the fixed stars, not as the lip of a hemispherical\n            shell or hollow, but as an actual sphere ().

The\n            small disc in the centre represents a section of the shaft, and the order of breadths of\n            rim is indicated by the arabic numerals.) What does Plato mean us to understand by the\n            different degrees of breadth of rim? On this subject I formerly\n            wrote:The simple and natural explanation is that the breadth of\n            the rims represents the size of the different planets. Each rim must of necessity be\n            broad enough to contain the planet which resides in it, and no reason can be conceived\n            why it should be any broader ( XV p. 392). In\n            maintaining this view, I supposed that the surfaces of the different whorls were\n            separated from one another by an interval representing the distances between the several\n            planets, interpreting  in 616 E (with Jowett) as\n            the  and not the  side of the\n            entire whorl. But, as Professor Cook Wilson points out, the Greek does not allow of this\n            interpretation, for , and  (616 D, E) shew\n            conclusively that the individual whorls are fitted closely into one another like a nest\n            of boxes, their upper surfaces forming one continuous plane. Cf. Proclus \n            l. c. 216. 8  From this it follows that, if the breadth of\n            a rim is equal to the diameter of its planet, planets in the same part of\n            their orbit will touch one another, and if we carry out the principle to the centre\n            whorl, the moon will be always touching the earth. Moreover the outer planet will be\n            continually grazing a fixed star (Cook Wilson). These considerations are\n            fatal to the view which I advocated; and I take this opportunity of retractation. The\n            theory which has most in its favour, as I now see, is that the breadth of the\n            rims is intended to signify the supposed distances of the orbits from each\n            other (Jowett and Campbell). It would be extraordinary,\n            writes Professor Cook Wilson, that Plato in representing the heavenly system\n            by his whorls should not have represented somehow the distances between the orbits of\n            the heavenly bodies, and the obvious way to do this was by making the thickness of the\n            spheres to which they are attached, or (as he prefers whorls on account of the distaff\n            of Necessity), the breadth of the rims of the whorls, symbolise these different\n            distances. On this view the natural position of the planet will be\n            close to the outer edge of its rim, and touching the outer surface of its\n            hemisphere.

The important point to keep in\n            mind, as Professor Cook Wilson observes, is that Plato has realised that the\n            apparent phenomena are what we call a composition of movements (or velocities). This\n            composition of movements he is not attempting to explain, by giving the sort of\n            machinery which he thought really produced it, but he is endeavouring to make us\n            understand what the movements  (not how they originate), by\n            putting the objects concerned in an imaginary machine, the movements of which we can\n            represent to the senses, and which would produce such movements in the objects as they\n            actually have. For similar reasons it is impossible to draw any inference\n            from this passage as to the question whether Plato believed in the daily revolution of\n            the earth. In the , according to Grote (, pp. 13 ff.), the cosmical axis is a solid\n            cylinder revolving or turning round, and causing thereby the revolution of the\n            circumference or the sidereal sphere, and necessarily also carrying round\n            with itself the Earth, which is massed or globed round the axis of the whole (\n            . Massed\n            or packed is Boeckh's interpretation of , with which Grote also agrees; but whether the word really\n            bears this meaning, is another question, which we need not here discuss.) In support of\n            his explanation of the passage in the , Grote appeals to the myth\n            of the ; and the appeal would be justified if Plato's figure of\n            Necessity's spindle were intended to explain the , and not\n            merely to represent the , of the celestial motions.
