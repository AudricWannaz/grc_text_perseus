The site of this monument is a standing puzzle to\narchaeologists. That it was, as H. says, originally set up circ.\n505 B.

C.not, however, on the\noriginal site. The evidence is as follows. In 1887 a broken block\nof Eleusinian stone, evidently a fragment of an oblong base, was\nfound in the ruins of a large building to the north-east of the\nPropylaea, probably near its original position. On the block may\nbe seen, in letters belonging to the end of the sixth century B. C., the\nwords (Hicks 12; C.I. A. iv. 334 a) , and below\n. Previously, in 1869, a block of Pentelic\nmarble, also a fragment of a base, had been found with an inscription\nin characters belonging to the middle of the fifth century (C. I. A. i.\n334) to this effect: , and in the line below\n, to which has been added more recently a scrap\ncontaining the syllable  twice repeated. Both inscriptions are\nclearly fragments of the dedication inscribed on the pedestal of the\nchariot: in both each couplet formed a single long line. But in the\nearlier the hexameters were transposed, the line referring to the\nchains standing first, which shows that the original monument stood\nnear the chains hung on the wall, whereas the newer was near the\nentrance of the Acropolis. In all probability the trophy was\nrestored after the conquest of Euboea by Pericles (i. e. 445 B. C.),\nor after that of Boeotia at the battle of Oenophyta (i. e. 456 B. C.).\nEither would be a suitable occasion for such a restoration. In\nfavour of the latter Hauvette (p. 51) urges that H., who must have\nseen the new monument, since he (like Diodorus and the Anthology) \nquotes the verses in the new order, gives no hint that the\ntrophy had just been restored.

These words\nraise a further difficulty. Does H. mean the famous Propylaea of\nMnesicles finished in 432 B. C.?

(2) On the\nslope immediately in front to the left there is no suitable site.\n\n(3) Pausanias (i. 28. 2) clearly implies that the chariot stood on the\nAcropolis itself inside the Propylaea. We must therefore infer that\nthe restored chariot was moved when the new Propylaea of Mnesicles\nwas built, and that H. is referring to the open space in front of the\nold Propylon. This gateway is still discernible behind the southwest \nwing of the Propylaea, set in the Pelasgic wall, and was probably\nrestored by Cimon after the Persian war (cf.

An only daughter was styled  (or in Doric\n or ), which means not that she is the heiress,\nbut that she passes with the inheritance. Aristotle (Pol. ii. 6.\n11, 1270 a 26 f.) distinctly tells us that if a father died intestate\nleaving only a daughter, the heir, as guardian of the orphan daughter,\nchose her a husband, and that even the father had but recently\nacquired the right to dispose of his daughter's hand as he pleased.\nIn the days of H. the kings dealt with the question, as did the\nArchon Eponymus at Athens. In so doing they clearly acted as\njudges merely determining to whom the  belonged by law.\nAll this is explained by the primitive constitution of the GraecoRoman \nfamily. The inheritance, along with the household cults, and\n, always passed to males. If, then, there were no sons\nbut only a daughter, the ancient principle debarred her from heirship,\nbut by custom she passed with the inheritance to the nearest male\nrelative, whom she married (so Gorgo Leonidas, vii. 205; cf. also\nvi. 71; Plut. Agis 11). Apparently a father, if he gave an only\n\ndaughter in marriage, must give her to the nearest relative,\nor to an adopted son. But adoption ( 5) itself took place\nbefore the kings, and must have been subject to legal rules. If\nthe father died without betrothing his daughter, the nearest male\nrelative could claim both the inheritance and the hand of the\ndaughter. If there were several claimants the kings decided\nbetween them. The same principles held good in Crete (cf. the\nGortyna Code) and at Athens. Cf.

[In later passages (; x. 430)\ntheir habitat is doubtful, though presumably in Asia.] The tradition \nthat the crossing was by the Bosporus is confirmed by the\nstatement of Strabo (566) that it was named of old the Mysian\nBosporus, and by the fact that this would be the natural crossingplace \nfrom Moesia to maritime Mysia near Cius (E.

(1) East of\nMount Olympus along the coast to the mouth of the Peneius, and\nup that river to Gonnus through the pass of Tempe; (2) through the\ndepression between western Olympus and the Pierian hills, called\nthe pass of Petra, leading to the sources of the river Europus or\nTitaresius, and down that river through Perrhaebia; (3) making\na much longer circuit round the mountains up the valley of the\n\nHaliacmon, and then turning south-east through a deep cleft in the\nCambunian Mountains (the pass of Volustana or Servia) to the\nupper valley of the Titaresius.

H. would appear to have\nimagined there was only one pass besides Tempe (cf. 173. 4), but if\nso his account is confused.

Again, the expressions  (131. 1, 173. 4), though possible of the mountain\npath, are more appropriate of the two other passes, since after crossing \nthe passes of Volustana and Petra a force coming from Macedonia \nto Oloosson (Elassona) has still to traverse the lower passes of\nPerrhaebia, i.e. the region between Mount Pindus and the Peneius,\nsouth of Tripolis, to which in 480 B.C. the Perrhaebi were confined.\nAgain, the phrases \n(cf. 127 n., 173. 4) apply properly to the mountain regions of Orestis,\nLyncestis and Elimia.

Deinde saltu angusto superatis\nmontibus, quos Cambunios vocant, descendit ad Azorum Pythium et\nDolichen: Tripolim vocant incolentes). Further, if Xerxes intended\nto march by the mountain path which led to Gonnus close to Tempe,\nwhy did he make a special excursion to it from Therma? On the\nwhole it would seem almost certain that Xerxes must have used the\neasier passes of Volustana and Petra for his main force, though a\ndetachment may have gone by the mountain path. The mountain\npath as the shortest circuit would naturally be used in turning the\nposition of a force holding Tempe (cf. ch. 173), as the Anopaea path\nwas at Thermopylae, and would therefore be the best known.

Meyer (F. ii. 211) holds the Thebans remained\nin order to desert with more effect, but it may well be that the Medizing\noligarchy at Thebes furnished as their contingent men of the\nopposite party (Diod. xi. 4 ) loyal to the Greek\ncause. The existence of such a party at Thebes seems proved (in\nspite of H. ix. 87) by the Theban orator's speech against Plataea\n(). For the dispatch of political opponents to the front\nto get rid of them, we may compare the attempt of the Corcyrean\ndemocrats to enlist their opponents for naval service (),\nthe sending of 300 oligarchic knights to Thibron by the restored\nAthenian democrats (), and of oligarchs to Cambyses \nby Polycrates (H. iii. 44. 2 n.).

Such hesitation, however,\nmay be easily paralleled from the genuine work of H. (cf. ii. 123. 1;\nv. 45. 2). Krger's arguments from language are stronger.

The traditional precise\nsynchronism between Plataea and Mycale (cf.
