When a woman's clothes come off, she dispenses with her modesty, too.\nMen have long ago made wise rules from which one ought to learn; one of these is that one should mind one's own business. As for me, I believe that your queen is the most beautiful of all women, and I ask you not to ask of me what is lawless.\n\n\nSpeaking thus,  resisted: for he was afraid that some evil would come of it for him. But this was ' answer: Courage, ! Do not be afraid of me, that I say this to test you, or of my wife, that you will have any harm from her. I will arrange it so that she shall never know that you have seen her.\nI will bring you into the chamber where she and I lie and conceal you behind the open door; and after I have entered, my wife too will come to bed. There is a chair standing near the entrance of the room: on this she will lay each article of her clothing as she takes it off, and you will be able to look upon her at your leisure.\nThen, when she moves from the chair to the bed, turning her back on you, be careful she does not see you going out through the doorway.\n\n\nAs  could not escape, he consented. , when he judged it to be time for bed, brought  into the chamber; his wife followed presently, and when she had come in and was laying aside her garments,  saw her;\n\nwhen she turned her back upon him to go to bed, he slipped from the room. The woman glimpsed him as he went out, and perceived what her husband had done. But though shamed, she did not cry out or let it be seen that she had perceived anything, for she meant to punish ;\n\nsince among the  and most of the foreign peoples it is felt as a great shame that even a man be seen naked.\n\n\nFor the present she made no sign and kept quiet. But as soon as it was day, she prepared those of her household whom she saw were most faithful to her, and called . He, supposing that she knew nothing of what had been done, answered the summons; for he was used to attending the queen whenever she summoned him.\nWhen  came, the lady addressed him thus: Now, , you have two ways before you; decide which you will follow. You must either kill  and take me and the throne of  for your own, or be killed yourself now without more ado; that will prevent you from obeying all ' commands in the future and seeing what you should not see.\nOne of you must die: either he, the contriver of this plot, or you, who have outraged all custom by looking on me uncovered.  stood awhile astonished at this; presently, he begged her not to compel him to such a choice.\nBut when he could not deter her, and saw that dire necessity was truly upon him either to kill his master or himself be killed by others, he chose his own life. Then he asked: Since you force me against my will to kill my master, I would like to know how we are to lay our hands on him.\nShe replied, You shall come at him from the same place where he made you view me naked: attack him in his sleep.\n\n\nWhen they had prepared this plot, and night had fallen,  followed the woman into the chamber (for  was not released, nor was there any means of deliverance, but either he or  must die). She gave him a dagger and hid him behind the same door;\n\nand presently he stole out and killed  as he slept. Thus he made himself master of the king's wife and sovereignty. He is mentioned in the iambic verses of  of  who lived about the same time.\n\n\nSo he took possession of the sovereign power and was confirmed in it by the  oracle. For when the  took exception to what was done to , and took up arms, the faction of  came to an agreement with the rest of the people that if the oracle should ordain him king of the , then he would reign; but if not, then he would return the kingship to the .\nThe oracle did so ordain, and  thus became king. However, the  priestess declared that the  would have vengeance on ' posterity in the fifth generation; an utterance to which the  and their kings paid no regard until it was fulfilled.\n\n\nThus the  robbed the  of the sovereignty and took it for themselves. Having gotten it,  sent many offerings to : there are very many silver offerings of his there; and besides the silver, he dedicated a hoard of gold, among which six golden bowls are the offerings especially worthy of mention.\nThese weigh thirty talents and stand in the treasury of the ; although in truth it is not the treasury of the  people but of  son of . This  then was the first foreigner whom we know who placed offerings at  after the king of ,  son of .\nFor  too made an offering: namely, the royal seat on which he sat to give judgment, and a marvellous seat it is. It is set in the same place as the bowls of . This gold and the silver offered by  is called by the   after its dedicator.\n\n\nAs soon as  came to the throne, he too, like others, led an army into the lands of  and ; and he took the city of . But as he did nothing else great in his reign of thirty-eight years, I shall say no more of him, and shall speak instead of  son of , who succeeded him. He took  and invaded the country of ; and it was while he was monarch of  that the , driven from their homes by the nomad , came into , and took , all but the acropolis.\n\n\n reigned for forty-nine years and was succeeded by his son , who reigned for twelve years; and after  came ,\n\nwho waged war against ' descendant  and the , drove the  out of , took  (which was a colony from ), and invaded the lands of . But he did not return from these as he wished, but with great disaster. Of other deeds done by him in his reign, these were the most notable:\n\n\nHe continued the war against the  which his father had begun. This was how he attacked and beseiged : he sent his army, marching to the sound of pipes and harps and bass and treble flutes, to invade when the crops in the land were ripe;\n\nand whenever he came to the  territory, he neither demolished nor burnt nor tore the doors off the country dwellings, but let them stand unharmed; but he destroyed the trees and the crops of the land, and so returned to where he came from;\n\nfor as the  had command of the sea, it was of no use for his army to besiege their city. The reason that the  did not destroy the houses was this: that the  might have homes from which to plant and cultivate their land, and that there might be the fruit of their toil for his invading army to lay waste.\n\n\nHe waged war in this way for eleven years, and in these years two great disasters overtook the , one at the battle of  in their own territory, and the other in the valley of the .\nFor six of these eleven years  son of  was still ruler of , and it was he who invaded the lands of , for it was he who had begun the war; for the following five the war was waged by ' son , who, as I have indicated before, inherited the war from his father and carried it on vigorously.\nNone of the  helped to lighten this war for the , except the : these lent their aid in return for a similar service done for them; for the  had previously helped the  in their war against the .\n\n\nIn the twelfth year, when the  army was burning the crops, the fire set in the crops, blown by a strong wind, caught the temple of  called  of , and the temple burned to the ground.\nFor the present no notice was taken of this. But after the army had returned to ,  fell ill; and, as his sickness lasted longer than it should, he sent to  to inquire of the oracle, either at someone's urging or by his own wish to question the god about his sickness.\nBut when the messengers came to , the  priestess would not answer them before they restored the temple of  at  in the  territory, which they had burnt.\n\n\nI know this much to be so because the  told me. The  add that  son of , a close friend of the  who then was sovereign of , learned what reply the oracle had given to , and sent a messenger to tell  so that his friend, forewarned, could make his plans accordingly.\n\n\nThe  say it happened so. Then, when the  reply was brought to , he promptly sent a herald to , offering to make a truce with  and the  during his rebuilding of the temple. So the envoy went to . But , forewarned of the whole matter, and knowing what  meant to do, devised the following plan:\n\nhe brought together into the marketplace all the food in the city, from private stores and his own, and told the men of  all to drink and celebrate together when he gave the word.\n\n\n did this so that when the herald from  saw a great heap of food piled up, and the citizens celebrating, he would bring word of it to :\n\nand so it happened. The herald saw all this, gave  the message he had been instructed by the  to deliver, and returned to ; and this, as I learn, was the sole reason for the reconciliation.\nFor  had supposed that there was great scarcity in  and that the people were reduced to the last extremity of misery; but now on his herald's return from the town he heard an account contrary to his expectations;\n\nso presently the  and  ended the war and agreed to be friends and allies, and  built not one but two temples of  at , and recovered from his illness. That is the story of ' war against  and the .\n\n\n, who disclosed the oracle's answer to , was the son of , and sovereign of . The  say (and the  agree) that the most marvellous thing that happened to him in his life was the landing on  of  of , brought there by a dolphin. This  was a lyre-player second to none in that age; he was the first man whom we know to compose and name the dithyramb which he afterwards taught at .\n\n\nThey say that this , who spent most of his time with , wished to sail to  and , and that after he had made a lot of money there he wanted to come back to .\nTrusting none more than the , he hired a  vessel to carry him from . But when they were out at sea, the crew plotted to take 's money and cast him overboard. Discovering this, he earnestly entreated them, asking for his life and offering them his money.\nBut the crew would not listen to him, and told him either to kill himself and so receive burial on land or else to jump into the sea at once.\nAbandoned to this extremity,  asked that, since they had made up their minds, they would let him stand on the half-deck in all his regalia and sing; and he promised that after he had sung he would do himself in.\nThe men, pleased at the thought of hearing the best singer in the world, drew away toward the waist of the vessel from the stern. , putting on all his regalia and taking his lyre, stood up on the half-deck and sang the Stirring Song, and when the song was finished he threw himself into the sea, as he was with all his regalia.\nSo the crew sailed away to ; but a dolphin (so the story goes) took  on his back and bore him to . Landing there, he went to  in his regalia, and when he arrived, he related all that had happened.\n\n, skeptical, kept him in confinement, letting him go nowhere, and waited for the sailors. When they arrived, they were summoned and asked what news they brought of . While they were saying that he was safe in  and that they had left him flourishing at ,  appeared before them, just as he was when he jumped from the ship; astonished, they could no longer deny what was proved against them.\nThis is what the  and  say, and there is a little bronze memorial of  on , the figure of a man riding upon a dolphin.\n\n\n the , his war with the  finished, died after a reign of fifty-seven years.\nHe was the second of his family to make an offering to  (after recovering from his illness) of a great silver bowl on a stand of welded iron. Among all the offerings at , this is the most worth seeing, and is the work of  the , the only one of all men who discovered how to weld iron.\n\n\nAfter the death of , his son , then thirty-five years of age, came to the throne. The first  whom he attacked were the .\nThese, besieged by him, dedicated their city to ; they did this by attaching a rope to the city wall from the temple of the goddess, which stood seven stades away from the ancient city which was then besieged.\nThese were the first whom  attacked; afterwards he made war on the  and  cities in turn, upon different pretexts: he found graver charges where he could, but sometimes alleged very petty grounds of offense.\n\n\nThen, when he had subjugated all the  of the mainland and made them tributary to him, he planned to build ships and attack the islanders;\n\nbut when his preparations for shipbuilding were underway, either  of  or  of  (the story is told of both) came to  and, asked by  for news about , put an end to the shipbuilding by giving the following answer:\n\nO King, the islanders are buying ten thousand horse, intending to march to  against you. , thinking that he spoke the truth, said: Would that the gods would put this in the heads of the islanders, to come on horseback against the sons of the ! Then the other answered and said:\n\nO King, you appear to me earnestly to wish to catch the islanders riding horses on the mainland, a natural wish. And what else do you suppose the islanders wished, as soon as they heard that you were building ships to attack them, than to catch  on the seas, so as to be revenged on you for the  who dwell on the mainland, whom you enslaved?\n\n was quite pleased with this conclusion, for he thought the man spoke reasonably and, heeding him, stopped building ships. Thus he made friends with the  inhabiting the islands.\n\n\nAs time went on,  subjugated almost all the nations west of the ; for except the  and , all the rest  held subject under him. These were the , , , , , , the  and , , , , , and ;\n\n\nand after these were subdued and subject to  in addition to the , all the sages from  who were living at that time, coming in different ways, came to , which was at the height of its property; and among them came  the , who, after making laws for the  at their request, went abroad for ten years, sailing forth to see the world, he said. This he did so as not to be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had made,\n\nsince the  themselves could not do that, for they were bound by solemn oaths to abide for ten years by whatever laws  should make.\n\n\nSo for that reason, and to see the world,  went to visit  in  and then to  in . When he got there,  entertained him in the palace, and on the third or fourth day  told his attendants to show  around his treasures, and they pointed out all those things that were great and blest.\nAfter  had seen everything and had thought about it,  found the opportunity to say, My  guest, we have heard a lot about you because of your wisdom and of your wanderings, how as one who loves learning you have traveled much of the world for the sake of seeing it, so now I desire to ask you who is the most fortunate man you have seen.\n\n asked this question believing that he was the most fortunate of men, but , offering no flattery but keeping to the truth, said, O King, it is  the .\n\n was amazed at what he had said and replied sharply, In what way do you judge  to be the most fortunate?  said,  was from a prosperous city, and his children were good and noble. He saw children born to them all, and all of these survived. His life was prosperous by our standards, and his death was most glorious:\n\nwhen the  were fighting their neighbors in , he came to help, routed the enemy, and died very finely. The  buried him at public expense on the spot where he fell and gave him much honor.\n\n\nWhen  had provoked him by saying that the affairs of  were so fortunate,  asked who he thought was next, fully expecting to win second prize.  answered,  and .\nThey were of  stock, had enough to live on, and on top of this had great bodily strength. Both had won prizes in the athletic contests, and this story is told about them: there was a festival of  in , and their mother absolutely had to be conveyed to the temple by a team of oxen. But their oxen had not come back from the fields in time, so the youths took the yoke upon their own shoulders under constraint of time. They drew the wagon, with their mother riding atop it, traveling five miles until they arrived at the temple.\nWhen they had done this and had been seen by the entire gathering, their lives came to an excellent end, and in their case the god made clear that for human beings it is a better thing to die than to live. The  men stood around the youths and congratulated them on their strength; the  women congratulated their mother for having borne such children.\nShe was overjoyed at the feat and at the praise, so she stood before the image and prayed that the goddess might grant the best thing for man to her children  and , who had given great honor to the goddess.\nAfter this prayer they sacrificed and feasted. The youths then lay down in the temple and went to sleep and never rose again; death held them there. The  made and dedicated at  statues of them as being the best of men.\n\n\nThus  granted second place in happiness to these men.  was vexed and said, My  guest, do you so much despise our happiness that you do not even make us worth as much as common men?  replied, , you ask me about human affairs, and I know that the divine is entirely grudging and troublesome to us.\nIn a long span of time it is possible to see many things that you do not want to, and to suffer them, too. I set the limit of a man's life at seventy years;\n\nthese seventy years have twenty-five thousand, two hundred days, leaving out the intercalary month. But if you make every other year longer by one month, so that the seasons agree opportunely, then there are thirty-five intercalary months during the seventy years, and from these months there are one thousand fifty days.\nOut of all these days in the seventy years, all twenty-six thousand, two hundred and fifty of them, not one brings anything at all like another. So, , man is entirely chance.\nTo me you seem to be very rich and to be king of many people, but I cannot answer your question before I learn that you ended your life well. The very rich man is not more fortunate than the man who has only his daily needs, unless he chances to end his life with all well. Many very rich men are unfortunate, many of moderate means are lucky.\nThe man who is very rich but unfortunate surpasses the lucky man in only two ways, while the lucky surpasses the rich but unfortunate in many. The rich man is more capable of fulfilling his appetites and of bearing a great disaster that falls upon him, and it is in these ways that he surpasses the other. The lucky man is not so able to support disaster or appetite as is the rich man, but his luck keeps these things away from him, and he is free from deformity and disease, has no experience of evils, and has fine children and good looks.\nIf besides all this he ends his life well, then he is the one whom you seek, the one worthy to be called fortunate. But refrain from calling him fortunate before he dies; call him lucky.\nIt is impossible for one who is only human to obtain all these things at the same time, just as no land is self-sufficient in what it produces. Each country has one thing but lacks another; whichever has the most is the best. Just so no human being is self-sufficient; each person has one thing but lacks another.\nWhoever passes through life with the most and then dies agreeably is the one who, in my opinion, O King, deserves to bear this name. It is necessary to see how the end of every affair turns out, for the god promises fortune to many people and then utterly ruins them.\n\n\nBy saying this,  did not at all please , who sent him away without regard for him, but thinking him a great fool, because he ignored the present good and told him to look to the end of every affair.\n\n\nBut after 's departure divine retribution fell heavily on ; as I guess, because he supposed himself to be blessed beyond all other men. Directly, as he slept, he had a dream, which showed him the truth of the evil things which were going to happen concerning his son.\nHe had two sons, one of whom was ruined, for he was mute, but the other, whose name was , was by far the best in every way of all of his peers. The dream showed this  to , how he would lose him struck and killed by a spear of iron.\nSo , after he awoke and considered, being frightened by the dream, brought in a wife for his son, and although  was accustomed to command the  armies,  now would not send him out on any such enterprise, while he took the javelins and spears and all such things that men use for war from the men's apartments and piled them in his store room, lest one should fall on his son from where it hung.\n\n\nNow while  was occupied with the marriage of his son, a  of the royal house came to , in great distress and with unclean hands. This man came to ' house, and asked to be purified according to the custom of the country; so  purified him (\n\nthe  have the same manner of purification as the ), and when he had done everything customary, he asked the  where he came from and who he was:\n\nFriend, he said, who are you, and from what place in  do you come as my suppliant? And what man or woman have you killed? O King, the man answered, I am the son of  the son of , and my name is ; I killed my brother accidentally, and I come here banished by my father and deprived of all.\n\n answered, All of your family are my friends, and you have come to friends, where you shall lack nothing, staying in my house. As for your misfortune, bear it as lightly as possible and you will gain most.\n\n\nSo  lived in ' house. About this same time a great monster of a boar appeared on the , who would come off that mountain and ravage the fields of the . The  had gone up against him often; but they never did him any harm but were hurt by him themselves.\nAt last they sent messengers to , with this message: O King, a great monster of a boar has appeared in the land, who is destroying our fields; for all our attempts, we cannot kill him; so now we ask you to send your son and chosen young men and dogs with us, so that we may drive him out of the country.\nSuch was their request, but  remembered the prophecy of his dream and answered them thus: Do not mention my son again: I will not send him with you. He is newly married, and that is his present concern. But I will send chosen , and all the huntsmen, and I will tell those who go to be as eager as possible to help you to drive the beast out of the country.\n\n\nThis was his answer, and the  were satisfied with it. But the son of  now entered, having heard what the  had asked for; and when  refused to send his son with them, the young man said,\n\nFather, it was once thought very fine and noble for us to go to war and the chase and win renown; but now you have barred me from both of these, although you have seen neither cowardice nor lack of spirit in me. With what face can I now show myself whenever I go to and from the market-place?\nWhat will the men of the city think of me, and what my newly wedded wife? With what kind of man will she think that she lives? So either let me go to the hunt, or show me by reasoning that what you are doing is best for me.\n\n\nMy son, answered , I do this not because I have seen cowardice or anything unseemly in you, but the vision of a dream stood over me in my sleep, and told me that you would be short-lived, for you would be killed by a spear of iron.\nIt is because of that vision that I hurried your marriage and do not send you on any enterprise that I have in hand, but keep guard over you, so that perhaps I may rob death of you during my lifetime. You are my only son: for that other, since he is ruined, he doesn't exist for me.\n\n\nFather, the youth replied, no one can blame you for keeping guard over me, when you have seen such a vision; but it is my right to show you what you do not perceive, and why you mistake the meaning of the dream.\nYou say that the dream told you that I should be killed by a spear of iron? But has a boar hands? Has it that iron spear which you dread? Had the dream said I should be killed by a tusk or some other thing proper to a boar, you would be right in acting as you act; but no, it was to be by a spear. Therefore, since it is not against men that we are to fight, let me go.\n\n\n answered, My son, your judgment concerning the dream has somewhat reassured me; and being reassured by you, I change my thinking and permit you to go to the chase.\n\n\nHaving said this,  sent for  the  and when he came addressed him thus: , when you were struck by ugly misfortune, for which I do not blame you, it was I who cleansed you, and received and still keep you in my house, defraying all your keep.\nNow then, as you owe me a return of good service for the good which I have done you, I ask that you watch over my son as he goes out to the chase. See that no thieving criminals meet you on the way, to do you harm.\nBesides, it is only right that you too should go where you can win renown by your deeds. That is fitting for your father's son; and you are strong enough besides.\n\n\nO King,  answered, I would not otherwise have gone into such an arena. One so unfortunate as I should not associate with the prosperous among his peers; nor have I the wish so to do, and for many reasons I would have held back.\nBut now, since you urge it and I must please you (since I owe you a return of good service), I am ready to do this; and as for your son, in so far as I can protect him, look for him to come back unharmed.\n\n\nSo when  had answered  thus, they went out provided with chosen young men and dogs. When they came to , they hunted for the beast and, finding him, formed a circle and threw their spears at him:\n\nthen the guest called , the man who had been cleansed of the deed of blood, missed the boar with his spear and hit the son of .\nSo  was struck by the spear and fulfilled the prophecy of the dream. One ran to tell  what had happened, and coming to  told the king of the fight and the fate of his son.\n\n\nDistraught by the death of his son,  cried out the more vehemently because the killer was one whom he himself had cleansed of blood,\n\nand in his great and terrible grief at this mischance he called on  by three names, , : the first, because he wanted the god to know what evil his guest had done him; the second, because he had received the guest into his house and thus unwittingly entertained the murderer of his son; and the third, because he had found his worst enemy in the man whom he had sent as a protector.\n\n\nSoon the  came, bearing the corpse, with the murderer following after. He then came and stood before the body and gave himself up to , holding out his hands and telling him to kill him over the corpse, mentioning his former misfortune, and that on top of that he had destroyed the one who purified him, and that he was not fit to live.\nOn hearing this,  took pity on , though his own sorrow was so great, and said to him, Friend, I have from you the entire penalty, since you sentence yourself to death. But it is not you that I hold the cause of this evil, except in so far as you were the unwilling doer of it, but one of the gods, the same one who told me long ago what was to be.\nSo  buried his own son in such manner as was fitting. But , son of  who was son of , this , the destroyer of his own brother and of the man who purified him, when the tomb was undisturbed by the presence of men, killed himself there by the sepulcher, seeing clearly now that he was the most heavily afflicted of all whom he knew.\n\n\nAfter the loss of his son,  remained in deep sorrow for two years. After this time, the destruction by  son of  of the sovereignty of  son of , and the growth of the power of the , distracted  from his mourning; and he determined, if he could, to forestall the increase of the  power before they became great.\nHaving thus determined, he at once made inquiries of the  and  oracles, sending messengers separately to , to  in , and to , while others were despatched to  and , and others to  in the  country.\nThese are the  oracles to which  sent for divination: and he told others to go inquire of  in . His intent in sending was to test the knowledge of the oracles, so that, if they were found to know the truth, he might send again and ask if he should undertake an expedition against the .\n\n\nAnd when he sent to test these shrines he gave the  these instructions: they were to keep track of the time from the day they left , and on the hundredth day inquire of the oracles what , king of , son of , was doing then; then they were to write down whatever the oracles answered and bring the reports back to him.\nNow none relate what answer was given by the rest of the oracles. But at , no sooner had the  entered the hall to inquire of the god and asked the question with which they were entrusted, than the  priestess uttered the following hexameter verses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving written down this inspired utterance of the  priestess, the  went back to . When the others as well who had been sent to various places came bringing their oracles,  then unfolded and examined all the writings. Some of them in no way satisfied him. But when he read the  message, he acknowledged it with worship and welcome, considering  as the only true place of divination, because it had discovered what he himself had done.\nFor after sending his envoys to the oracles, he had thought up something which no conjecture could discover, and carried it out on the appointed day: namely, he had cut up a tortoise and a lamb, and then boiled them in a cauldron of bronze covered with a lid of the same.\n\n\nSuch, then, was the answer from  delivered to . As to the reply which the  received from the oracle of  when they had followed the due custom of the temple, I cannot say what it was, for nothing is recorded of it, except that  believed that from this oracle too he had obtained a true answer.\n\n\nAfter this, he tried to win the favor of the  god with great sacrifices. He offered up three thousand beasts from all the kinds fit for sacrifice, and on a great pyre burnt couches covered with gold and silver, golden goblets, and purple cloaks and tunics; by these means he hoped the better to win the aid of the god, to whom he also commanded that every  sacrifice what he could.\nWhen the sacrifice was over, he melted down a vast store of gold and made ingots of it, the longer sides of which were of six and the shorter of three palms' length, and the height was one palm. There were a hundred and seventeen of these. Four of them were of refined gold, each weighing two talents and a half; the rest were of gold with silver alloy, each of two talents' weight.\nHe also had a figure of a lion made of refined gold, weighing ten talents. When the temple of  was burnt, this lion fell from the ingots which were the base on which it stood; and now it is in the treasury of the , but weighs only six talents and a half, for the fire melted away three and a half talents.\n\n\nWhen these offerings were ready,  sent them to , with other gifts besides: namely, two very large bowls, one of gold and one of silver. The golden bowl stood to the right, the silver to the left of the temple entrance.\nThese too were removed about the time of the temple's burning, and now the golden bowl, which weighs eight and a half talents and twelve minae, is in the treasury of the , and the silver bowl at the corner of the forecourt of the temple. This bowl holds six hundred nine-gallon measures: for the  use it for a mixing-bowl at the feast of the Divine Appearance.\nIt is said by the  to be the work of  of , and I agree with them, for it seems to me to be of no common workmanship. Moreover,  sent four silver casks, which stand in the treasury of the , and dedicated two sprinkling-vessels, one of gold, one of silver. The golden vessel bears the inscription Given by the , who claim it as their offering. But they are wrong,\n\nfor this, too, is ' gift. The inscription was made by a certain , whose name I know but do not mention, out of his desire to please the . The figure of a boy, through whose hand the water runs, is indeed a  gift; but they did not give either of the sprinkling-vessels.\nAlong with these  sent, besides many other offerings of no great distinction, certain round basins of silver, and a female figure five feet high, which the  assert to be the statue of the woman who was ' baker. Moreover, he dedicated his own wife's necklaces and girdles.\n\n\nSuch were the gifts which he sent to . To , of whose courage and fate he had heard, he dedicated a shield made entirely of gold and a spear all of solid gold, point and shaft alike. Both of these were until my time at , in the  temple of .\n\n\nThe  who were to bring these gifts to the temples were instructed by  to inquire of the oracles whether he was to send an army against the  and whether he was to add an army of allies.\nWhen the  came to the places where they were sent, they presented the offerings, and inquired of the oracles, in these words: , king of  and other nations, believing that here are the only true places of divination among men, endows you with such gifts as your wisdom deserves. And now he asks you whether he is to send an army against the , and whether he is to add an army of allies.\nSuch was their inquiry; and the judgment given to  by each of the two oracles was the same: namely, that if he should send an army against the  he would destroy a great empire. And they advised him to discover the mightiest of the  and make them his friends.\n\n\nWhen the divine answers had been brought back and  learned of them, he was very pleased with the oracles. So, altogether expecting that he would destroy the kingdom of , he sent once again to  and endowed the , whose number he had learned, with two gold staters apiece.\nThe , in return, gave  and all  the right of first consulting the oracle, exemption from all charges, the chief seats at festivals, and perpetual right of  citizenship to whoever should wish it.\n\n\nAfter his gifts to the ,  made a third inquiry of the oracle, for he wanted to use it to the full, having received true answers from it; and the question which he asked was whether his sovereignty would be of long duration. To this the  priestess answered as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen he heard these verses,  was pleased with them above all, for he thought that a mule would never be king of the  instead of a man, and therefore that he and his posterity would never lose his empire. Then he sought very carefully to discover who the mightiest of the  were, whom he should make his friends.\nHe found by inquiry that the chief peoples were the  among those of , and the  among those of  stock. These races,  and , were the foremost in ancient time, the first a  and the second a  people. The  race has never yet left its home; the  has wandered often and far.\nFor in the days of king  it inhabited the land of , then the country called , under  and , in the time of  son of ; driven from this  country by the , it settled about  in the territory called ; from there again it migrated to , and at last came from  into the , where it took the name of .\n\n\nWhat language the  spoke I cannot say definitely. But if one may judge by those that still remain of the  who live above the  in the city of who were once neighbors of the people now called , and at that time inhabited the country which now is called \n\nand of the  who inhabited  and  on the , who came to live among the , and by other towns too which were once  and afterwards took a different name: if, as I said, one may judge by these, the  spoke a language which was not .\nIf, then, all the  stock spoke so, then the Attic nation, being of  blood, must have changed its language too at the time when it became part of the . For the people of  and  have a language of their own in common, which is not the language of their neighbors; and it is plain that they still preserve the manner of speech which they brought with them in their migration into the places where they live.\n\n\nBut the  stock, it seems clear to me, has always had the same language since its beginning; yet being, when separated from the , few in number, they have grown from a small beginning to comprise a multitude of nations, chiefly because the  and many other foreign peoples united themselves with them. Before that, I think, the  stock nowhere increased much in number while it was of foreign speech.\n\n\nNow of these two peoples,  learned that the Attic was held in subjection and divided into factions by , son of , who at that time was sovereign over the . This  was still a private man when a great marvel happened to him when he was at  to see the games: when he had offered the sacrifice, the vessels, standing there full of meat and water, boiled without fire until they boiled over.\n\n the , who happened to be there and who saw this marvel, advised  not to take to his house a wife who could bear children, but if he had one already, then to send her away, and if he had a son, to disown him.\n\n refused to follow the advice of ; and afterward there was born to him this , who, when there was a feud between the  of the coast under  son of  and the  of the plain under  son of , raised up a third faction, as he coveted the sovereign power. He collected partisans and pretended to champion the uplanders, and the following was his plan.\nWounding himself and his mules, he drove his wagon into the marketplace, with a story that he had escaped from his enemies, who would have killed him (so he said) as he was driving into the country. So he implored the people to give him a guard: and indeed he had won a reputation in his command of the army against the , when he had taken  and performed other great exploits.\nTaken in, the  people gave him a guard of chosen citizens, whom  made clubmen instead of spearmen: for the retinue that followed him carried wooden clubs.\nThese rose with  and took the Acropolis; and  ruled the , disturbing in no way the order of offices nor changing the laws, but governing the city according to its established constitution and arranging all things fairly and well.\n\n\nBut after a short time the partisans of  and of  made common cause and drove him out. In this way  first got  and, as he had a sovereignty that was not yet firmly rooted, lost it. Presently his enemies who together had driven him out began to feud once more.\nThen , harassed by factional strife, sent a message to  offering him his daughter to marry and the sovereign power besides.\nWhen this offer was accepted by , who agreed on these terms with , they devised a plan to bring  back which, to my mind, was so exceptionally foolish that it is strange (since from old times the  stock has always been distinguished from foreign by its greater cleverness and its freedom from silly foolishness) that these men should devise such a plan to deceive , said to be the subtlest of the .\nThere was in the  deme a woman called , three fingers short of six feet, four inches in height, and otherwise, too, well-formed. This woman they equipped in full armor and put in a chariot, giving her all the paraphernalia to make the most impressive spectacle, and so drove into the city; heralds ran before them, and when they came into town proclaimed as they were instructed:\n\n, give a hearty welcome to , whom  herself honors above all men and is bringing back to her own acropolis. So the heralds went about proclaiming this; and immediately the report spread in the demes that  was bringing  back, and the townsfolk, believing that the woman was the goddess herself, worshipped this human creature and welcomed .\n\n\nHaving got back his sovereignty in the manner which I have described,  married ' daughter according to his agreement with . But as he already had young sons, and as the  family were said to be under a curse, he had no wish that his newly-wedded wife bear him children, and therefore had unusual intercourse with her.\nAt first the woman hid the fact: presently she told her mother (whether interrogated or not, I do not know) and the mother told her husband.  was very angry to be dishonored by ; and in his anger he patched up his quarrel with the other faction. , learning what was going on, went alone away from the country altogether, and came to  where he deliberated with his sons.\nThe opinion of  prevailing, that they should recover the sovereignty, they set out collecting contributions from all the cities that owed them anything. Many of these gave great amounts, the  more than any,\n\nand in course of time, not to make a long story, everything was ready for their return: for they brought  mercenaries from the , and there joined them on his own initiative a man of  called , who was most keen in their cause and brought them money and men.\n\n\nSo after ten years they set out from  and returned home. The first place in  which they took and held was Marathon: and while encamped there they were joined by their partisans from the city, and by others who flocked to them from the countrydemesmen who loved the rule of one more than freedom. These, then, assembled;\n\nbut the  in the city, who while  was collecting money and afterwards when he had taken Marathon took no notice of it, did now, and when they learned that he was marching from Marathon against , they set out to attack him.\nThey came out with all their force to meet the returning exiles. ' men encountered the enemy when they had reached the temple of  in their march from Marathon towards the city, and encamped face to face with them.\nThere (by the providence of heaven)  met  the , a diviner, who came to him and prophesied as follows in hexameter verses:\n\n\n\n\nSo  spoke, being inspired;  understood him and, saying that he accepted the prophecy, led his army against the enemy. The  of the city had by this time had breakfast, and after breakfast some were dicing and some were sleeping: they were attacked by ' men and put to flight.\nSo they fled, and  devised a very subtle plan to keep them scattered and prevent them assembling again: he had his sons mount and ride forward: they overtook the fugitives and spoke to them as they were instructed by , telling them to take heart and each to depart to his home.\n\n\nThe  did, and by this means  gained  for the third time, rooting his sovereignty in a strong guard and revenue collected both from  and from the district of the river , and he took hostage the sons of the  who remained and did not leave the city at once, and placed these in .\n\n(He had conquered  too and put  in charge.) And besides this, he purified the island of  as a result of oracles, and this is how he did it: he removed all the dead that were buried in ground within sight of the temple and conveyed them to another part of .\nSo  was sovereign of : and as for the , some had fallen in the battle, and some, with the , were exiles from their native land.\n\n\nSo  learned that at that time such problems were oppressing the , but that the  had escaped from the great evils and had mastered the  in war. In the kingship of  and  at , the  were successful in all their other wars but met disaster only against the .\nBefore this they had been the worst-governed of nearly all the  and had had no dealings with strangers, but they changed to good government in this way: , a man of reputation among the , went to the oracle at . As soon as he entered the hall, the priestess said in hexameter:\n\n\n\n\nSome say that the  also declared to him the constitution that now exists at , but the  themselves say that  brought it from  when he was guardian of his nephew , the  king.\nOnce he became guardian, he changed all the laws and took care that no one transgressed the new ones.  afterwards established their affairs of war: the sworn divisions, the bands of thirty, the common meals; also the ephors and the council of elders.\n\n\nThus they changed their bad laws to good ones, and when  died they built him a temple and now worship him greatly. Since they had good land and many men, they immediately flourished and prospered. They were not content to live in peace, but, confident that they were stronger than the , asked the oracle at  about gaining all the  land.\nShe replied in hexameter:\n\n\nWhen the  heard the oracle reported, they left the other  alone and marched on  carrying chains, relying on the deceptive oracle. They were confident they would enslave the , but they were defeated in battle.\nThose taken alive were bound in the very chains they had brought with them, and they measured the  plain with a rope by working the fields. The chains in which they were bound were still preserved in my day, hanging up at the temple of .\n\n\nIn the previous war the  continually fought unsuccessfully against the , but in the time of  and the kingship of  and  in  the  had gained the upper hand. This is how:\n\nwhen they kept being defeated by the , they sent ambassadors to  to ask which god they should propitiate to prevail against the  in war. The  responded that they should bring back the bones of , son of .\nWhen they were unable to discover ' tomb, they sent once more to the god to ask where he was buried. The  responded in hexameter to the messengers:\n\n\n\n\nWhen the  heard this, they were no closer to discovery, though they looked everywhere. Finally it was found by , who was one of the  who are called doers of good deeds.. These men are those citizens who retire from the knights, the five oldest each year. They have to spend the year in which they retire from the knights being sent here and there by the  state, never resting in their efforts.\n\n\nIt was , one of these men, who found the tomb in  by a combination of luck and skill. At that time there was free access to , so he went into a blacksmith's shop and watched iron being forged, standing there in amazement at what he saw done.\nThe smith perceived that he was amazed, so he stopped what he was doing and said, My  guest, if you had seen what I saw, then you would really be amazed, since you marvel so at ironworking.\nI wanted to dig a well in the courtyard here, and in my digging I hit upon a coffin twelve feet long. I could not believe that there had ever been men taller than now, so I opened it and saw that the corpse was just as long as the coffin. I measured it and then reburied it. So the smith told what he had seen, and  thought about what was said and reckoned that this was , according to the oracle.\nIn the smith's two bellows he found the winds, hammer and anvil were blow upon blow, and the forging of iron was woe upon woe, since he figured that iron was discovered as an evil for the human race.\nAfter reasoning this out, he went back to  and told the  everything. They made a pretence of bringing a charge against him and banishing him. Coming to , he explained his misfortune to the smith and tried to rent the courtyard, but the smith did not want to lease it.\nFinally he persuaded him and set up residence there. He dug up the grave and collected the bones, then hurried off to  with them. Ever since then the  were far superior to the  whenever they met each other in battle. By the time of ' inquiry, the  had subdued most of the .\n\n\n, then, aware of all this, sent messengers to  with gifts to ask for an alliance, having instructed them what to say. They came and said:\n\n, King of  and other nations, has sent us with this message: , the god has declared that I should make the  my friend; now, therefore, since I learn that you are the leaders of , I invite you, as the oracle bids; I would like to be your friend and ally, without deceit or guile.\n\n proposed this through his messengers; and the , who had already heard of the oracle given to , welcomed the coming of the  and swore to be his friends and allies; and indeed they were obliged by certain benefits which they had received before from the king.\nFor the  had sent to  to buy gold, intending to use it for the statue of  which now stands on  in ; and , when they offered to buy it, made them a free gift of it.\n\n\nFor this reason, and because he had chosen them as his friends before all the other , the  accepted the alliance. So they declared themselves ready to serve him when he should require, and moreover they made a bowl of bronze, engraved around the rim outside with figures, and large enough to hold twenty-seven hundred gallons, and brought it with the intention of making a gift in return to .\nThis bowl never reached , for which two reasons are given: the  say that when the bowl was near  on its way to , the  descended upon them in warships and carried it off;\n\nbut the  themselves say that the  who were bringing the bowl, coming too late, and learning that  and  were taken, sold it in  to certain private men, who set it up in the the temple of . And it may be that the sellers of the bowl, when they returned to , said that they had been robbed of it by the . Such are the tales about the bowl.\n\n\n, mistaking the meaning of the oracle, invaded , expecting to destroy  and the  power.\nBut while he was preparing to march against the , a certain , who was already held to be a wise man, and who, from the advice which he now gave, won a great name among the , advised him as follows (his name was ): O King, you are getting ready to march against men who wear trousers of leather and whose complete wardrobe is of leather, and who eat not what they like but what they have; for their land is stony.\nFurther, they do not use wine, but drink water, have no figs to eat, or anything else that is good. Now if you conquer them, of what will you deprive them, since they have nothing? But if on the other hand you are conquered, then look how many good things you will lose; for once they have tasted of our blessings they will cling so tightly to them that nothing will pry them away.\nFor myself, then, I thank the gods that they do not put it in the heads of the  to march against the .  spoke thus but he did not persuade . Indeed, before they conquered the , the  had no luxury and no comforts.\n\n\nNow the  are called by the , and these  before the  rule were subjects of the , and, at this time, of .\nFor the boundary of the Median and  empires was the river , which flows from the  first through  and afterwards between the  on the right and the  on the other hand; then, passing these and still flowing north, it separates the  on the right from the  on the left.\nThus the  river cuts off nearly the whole of the lower part of  from the  to the . Here is the narrowest neck of all this land; the length of the journey across for a man traveling unencumbered is five days.\n\n\nThe reasons for ' expedition against  were these: he desired to gain territory in addition to his own, and (these were the chief causes) he trusted the oracle and wished to avenge  on ; for , son of , had conquered  and held him in subjection.\nNow , son of  and the king of Media, was ' brother-in-law: and this is how he came to be so.\nA tribe of wandering  separated itself from the rest, and escaped into Median territory. This was then ruled by , son of , son of .  at first treated the  kindly, as suppliants for his mercy; and, as he had a high regard for them, he entrusted boys to their tutelage to be taught their language and the skill of archery.\nAs time went on, it happened that the , who were accustomed to go hunting and always to bring something back, once had taken nothing, and when they returned empty-handed,  treated them very roughly and contemptuously (being, as appears from this, prone to anger).\nThe , feeling themselves wronged by the treatment they had from , planned to take one of the boys who were their pupils and cut him in pieces; then, dressing the flesh as they were accustomed to dress the animals which they killed, to bring and give it to  as if it were the spoils of the hunt; and after that, to make their way with all speed to  son of  at . All this they did.\n\n and the guests who ate with him dined on the boy's flesh, and the , having done as they planned, fled to  for protection.\n\n\nAfter this, since  would not give up the  to  at his demand, there was war between the  and the  for five years; each won many victories over the other, and once they fought a battle by night.\nThey were still warring with equal success, when it happened, at an encounter which occurred in the sixth year, that during the battle the day was suddenly turned to night.  of  had foretold this loss of daylight to the , fixing it within the year in which the change did indeed happen.\nSo when the  and  saw the day turned to night, they stopped fighting, and both were the more eager to make peace. Those who reconciled them were  the  and  the ;\n\nthey brought it about that there should be a sworn agreement and a compact of marriage between them: they judged that  should give his daughter  to , son of ; for without strong constraint agreements will not keep their force.\nThese nations make sworn compacts as do the ; and besides, when they cut the skin of their arms, they lick each other's blood.\n\n\n had subjugated this , then, ' own mother's father, for the reason which I shall presently disclose.\nHaving this reason to quarrel with ,  sent to ask the oracles if he should march against the ; and when a deceptive answer came he thought it to be favorable to him, and so led his army into the  territory.\nWhen he came to the river , he transported his army across itby the bridges which were there then, as I maintain; but the general belief of the  is that  of  got the army across.\nThe story is that, as  did not know how his army could pass the river (as the aforesaid bridges did not yet exist then), , who was in the encampment, made the river, which flowed on the left of the army, also flow on the right, in the following way.\nStarting from a point on the river upstream from the camp, he dug a deep semi-circular trench, so that the stream, turned from its ancient course, would flow in the trench to the rear of the camp and, passing it, would issue into its former bed, with the result that as soon as the river was thus divided into two, both channels could be forded.\nSome even say that the ancient channel dried up altogether. But I do not believe this; for in that case, how did they pass the river when they were returning?\n\n\nPassing over with his army,  then came to the part of  called  (it is the strongest part of this country and lies on the line of the city of  on the ), where he encamped and devastated the farms of the ;\n\nand he took and enslaved the city of the , and took all the places around it also, and drove the  from their homes, though they had done him no harm. , mustering his army, advanced to oppose , gathering to him all those who lived along the way.\nBut before beginning his march, he sent heralds to the  to try to draw them away from . The  would not be prevailed on; but when  arrived and encamped face to face with , there in the  country the armies had a trial of strength.\nThe fighting was fierce, many on both sides fell, and at nightfall they disengaged with neither side victorious. The two sides contended thus.\n\n\n was not content with the size of his force, for his army that had engaged was far smaller than that of ; therefore, when on the day after the battle  did not try attacking again, he marched away to , intending to summon the  in accordance with their treaty \n\n(for before making an alliance with the  he had made one also with  king of ), and to send for the  also (for with these too he had made an alliance,  at this time being their sovereign),\n\nand to summon the  to join him at a fixed time. He had in mind to muster all these forces and assemble his own army, then to wait until the winter was over and march against the  at the beginning of spring.\nWith such an intention, as soon as he returned to , he sent heralds to all his allies, summoning them to assemble at  in five months' time; and as for the soldiers whom he had with him, who had fought with the , all of them who were mercenaries he discharged, never thinking that after a contest so equal  would march against .\n\n\nThis was how  reasoned. Meanwhile, snakes began to swarm in the outer part of the city; and when they appeared the horses, leaving their accustomed pasture, devoured them. When  saw this he thought it a portent, and so it was.\nHe at once sent to the homes of the  interpreters, to inquire concerning it; but though his messengers came and learned from the  what the portent meant, they could not bring back word to , for he was a prisoner before they could make their voyage back to .\nNonetheless, this was the judgment of the : that  must expect a foreign army to attack his country, and that when it came, it would subjugate the inhabitants of the land: for the snake, they said, was the offspring of the land, but the horse was an enemy and a foreigner. This was the answer which the  gave , knowing as yet nothing of the fate of  and of the king himself; but when they gave it,  was already taken.\n\n\nWhen  marched away after the battle in the  country, , learning that  had gone intending to disband his army, deliberated and perceived that it would be opportune for him to march quickly against , before the power of the  could be assembled again.\nThis he decided, and this he did immediately; he marched his army into  and so came himself to bring the news of it to . All had turned out contrary to ' expectation, and he was in a great quandary; nevertheless, he led out the  to battle.\nNow at this time there was no nation in  more valiant or warlike than the . It was their custom to fight on horseback, carrying long spears, and they were skillful at managing horses.\n\n\nSo the armies met in the plain, wide and bare, that is before the city of : the  and other rivers flow across it and run violently together into the greatest of them, which is called  (this flows from the mountain sacred to the Mother  and empties into the sea near the city of ).\nWhen  saw the  maneuvering their battle-lines here, he was afraid of their cavalry, and therefore at the urging of one , a , he did as I shall describe. Assembling all the camels that followed his army bearing food and baggage, he took off their burdens and mounted men upon them equipped like cavalrymen; having equipped them, he ordered them to advance before his army against ' cavalry; he directed the infantry to follow the camels, and placed all his cavalry behind the infantry.\nWhen they were all in order, he commanded them to kill all the other  who came in their way, and spare none, but not to kill  himself, even if he should defend himself against capture.\nSuch was his command. The reason for his posting the camels to face the cavalry was this: horses fear camels and can endure neither the sight nor the smell of them; this then was the intention of his maneuver, that ' cavalry, on which the  relied to distinguish himself, might be of no use.\nSo when battle was joined, as soon as the horses smelled and saw the camels they turned to flight, and all ' hope was lost.\nNevertheless the  were no cowards; when they saw what was happening, they leaped from their horses and fought the  on foot. Many of both armies fell; at length the  were routed and driven within their city wall, where they were besieged by the .\n\n\nSo then they were besieged. But , supposing that the siege would last a long time, again sent messengers from the city to his allies; whereas the former envoys had been sent to summon them to muster at  in five months' time, these were to announce that  was besieged and to plead for help as quickly as possible.\n\n\nSo he sent to the  as well as to the rest of the allies. Now at this very time the  themselves were feuding with the  over the country called ;\n\nfor this was a part of the  territory which the  had cut off and occupied. (All the land towards the west, as far as , belonged then to the , and not only the mainland, but the island of  and the other islands.)\nThe  came out to save their territory from being cut off, then after debate the two armies agreed that three hundred of each side should fight, and whichever party won would possess the land. The rest of each army was to go away to its own country and not be present at the battle, since, if the armies remained on the field, the men of either party might render assistance to their comrades if they saw them losing.\nHaving agreed, the armies drew off, and picked men of each side remained and fought. Neither could gain advantage in the battle; at last, only three out of the six hundred were left,  and  of the ,  of the : these three were left alive at nightfall.\nThen the two , believing themselves victors, ran to ; but  the , after stripping the  dead and taking the arms to his camp, waited at his position. On the second day both armies came to learn the issue.\nFor a while both claimed the victory, the  arguing that more of their men had survived, the  showing that the  had fled, while their man had stood his ground and stripped the enemy dead.\nAt last from arguing they fell to fighting; many of both sides fell, but the  gained the victory. The , who before had worn their hair long by fixed custom, shaved their heads ever after and made a law, with a curse added to it, that no  grow his hair, and no  woman wear gold, until they recovered ;\n\nand the  made a contrary law, that they wear their hair long ever after; for until now they had not worn it so. , the lone survivor of the three hundred, was ashamed, it is said, to return to  after all the men of his company had been killed, and killed himself on the spot at .\n\n\nThe  herald came after this had happened to the  to ask for their help for , now besieged; nonetheless, when they heard the herald, they prepared to send help; but when they were already equipped and their ships ready, a second message came that the fortification of the  was taken and  a prisoner. Then, though very sorry indeed, they ceased their efforts.\n\n\nThis is how  was taken. When  had been besieged for fourteen days,  sent horsemen around in his army to promise to reward whoever first mounted the wall.\nAfter this the army made an assault, but with no success. Then, when all the others were stopped, a certain  called  attempted to mount by a part of the acropolis where no guard had been set, since no one feared that it could be taken by an attack made here.\nFor here the height on which the acropolis stood is sheer and unlikely to be assaulted; this was the only place where  the former king of  had not carried the lion which his concubine had borne him, the  having declared that if this lion were carried around the walls,  could never be taken.  then carried the lion around the rest of the wall of the acropolis where it could be assaulted, but neglected this place, because the height was sheer and defied attack. It is on the side of the city which faces towards .\nThe day before, then, , this , had seen one of the  come down by this part of the acropolis after a helmet that had fallen down, and fetch it; he took note of this and considered it.\nAnd now he climbed up himself, and other  after him. Many ascended, and thus  was taken and all the city sacked.\n\n\nI will now relate what happened to  himself. He had a son, whom I have already mentioned, fine in other respects, but mute. Now in his days of prosperity past  had done all that he could for his son; and besides resorting to other devices he had sent to  to inquire of the oracle concerning him.\nThe  priestess answered him thus:\n\n\nSo at the taking of the fortification a certain , not knowing who  was, came at him meaning to kill him.  saw him coming, but because of the imminent disaster he was past caring, and it made no difference to him whether he were struck and killed.\nBut this mute son, when he saw the  coming on, in fear and distress broke into speech and cried, Man, do not kill ! This was the first word he uttered, and after that for all the rest of his life he had power of speech.\n\n\nThe  gained  and took  prisoner.  had ruled fourteen years and been besieged fourteen days. Fulfilling the oracle, he had destroyed his own great empire. The  took him and brought him to ,\n\nwho erected a pyre and mounted  atop it, bound in chains, with twice seven sons of the  beside him.  may have intended to sacrifice him as a victory-offering to some god, or he may have wished to fulfill a vow, or perhaps he had heard that  was pious and put him atop the pyre to find out if some divinity would deliver him from being burned alive.\nSo  did this. As  stood on the pyre, even though he was in such a wretched position it occurred to him that  had spoken with god's help when he had said that no one among the living is fortunate. When this occurred to him, he heaved a deep sigh and groaned aloud after long silence, calling out three times the name .\n\n heard and ordered the interpreters to ask  who he was invoking. They approached and asked, but  kept quiet at their questioning, until finally they forced him and he said, I would prefer to great wealth his coming into discourse with all despots. Since what he said was unintelligible, they again asked what he had said,\n\npersistently harassing him. He explained that first  the  had come and seen all his fortune and spoken as if he despised it. Now everything had turned out for him as  had said, speaking no more of him than of every human being, especially those who think themselves fortunate. While  was relating all this, the pyre had been lit and the edges were on fire.\nWhen  heard from the interpreters what  said, he relented and considered that he, a human being, was burning alive another human being, one his equal in good fortune. In addition, he feared retribution, reflecting how there is nothing stable in human affairs. He ordered that the blazing fire be extinguished as quickly as possible, and that  and those with him be taken down, but despite their efforts they could not master the fire.\n\n\nThen the  say that  understood ' change of heart, and when he saw everyone trying to extinguish the fire but unable to check it, he invoked , crying out that if  had ever been given any pleasing gift by him, let him offer help and deliver him from the present evil.\nThus he in tears invoked the god, and suddenly out of a clear and windless sky clouds gathered, a storm broke, and it rained violently, extinguishing the pyre. Thus  perceived that  was dear to god and a good man. He had him brought down from the pyre and asked,\n\n, what man persuaded you to wage war against my land and become my enemy instead of my friend? He replied, O King, I acted thus for your good fortune, but for my own ill fortune. The god of the  is responsible for these things, inciting me to wage war.\nNo one is so foolish as to choose war over peace. In peace sons bury their fathers, in war fathers bury their sons. But I suppose it was dear to the divinity that this be so.\n\n\n said this, and  freed him and made him sit near and was very considerate to him, and both he and all that were with him were astonished when they looked at . He for his part was silent, deep in thought.\nPresently he turned and said (for he saw the  sacking the city of the ), O King, am I to say to you what is in my mind now, or keep silent? When  urged him to speak up boldly,  asked,\n\nThe multitude there, what is it at which they are so busily engaged? They are plundering your city, said , and carrying off your possessions. No,  answered, not my city, and not my possessions; for I no longer have any share of all this; it is your wealth that they are pillaging.\n\n\n thought about what  had said and, telling the rest to withdraw, asked  what fault he saw in what was being done. Since the gods have made me your slave, replied the , it is right that if I have any further insight I should point it out to you.\nThe  being by nature violent men are poor; so if you let them seize and hold great possessions, you may expect that he who has got most will revolt against you. Therefore do this, if you like what I say.\nHave men of your guard watch all the gates; let them take the spoil from those who are carrying it out, and say that it must be paid as a tithe to . Thus you shall not be hated by them for taking their wealth by force, and they, recognizing that you act justly, will give up the spoil willingly.\n\n\nWhen  heard this, he was exceedingly pleased, for he believed the advice good; and praising him greatly, and telling his guard to act as  had advised, he said: , now that you, a king, are determined to act and to speak with integrity, ask me directly for whatever favor you like.\n\nMaster, said , you will most gratify me if you will let me send these chains of mine to that god of the  whom I especially honored and to ask him if it is his way to deceive those who serve him well. When  asked him what grudge against the god led him to make this request,\n\n repeated to him the story of all his own aspirations, and the answers of the oracles, and more particularly his offerings, and how the oracle had encouraged him to attack the ; and so saying he once more insistently pled that he be allowed to reproach the god for this. At this  smiled, and replied, This I will grant you, , and whatever other favor you may ever ask me.\nWhen  heard this, he sent  to , telling them to lay his chains on the doorstep of the temple, and to ask the god if he were not ashamed to have persuaded  to attack the , telling him that he would destroy ' power; of which power (they were to say, showing the chains) these were the first-fruits. They should ask this; and further, if it were the way of the  gods to be ungrateful.\n\n\nWhen the  came, and spoke as they had been instructed, the priestess (it is said) made the following reply. No one may escape his lot, not even a god.  has paid for the sin of his ancestor of the fifth generation before, who was led by the guile of a woman to kill his master, though he was one of the guard of the , and who took to himself the royal state of that master, to which he had no right.\nAnd it was the wish of  that the evil lot of  fall in the lifetime of ' sons, not in his own; but he could not deflect the Fates.\nYet as far as they gave in, he did accomplish his wish and favor : for he delayed the taking of  for three years. And let  know this: that although he is now taken, it is by so many years later than the destined hour. And further,  saved  from burning.\nBut as to the oracle that was given to him,  is wrong to complain concerning it. For  declared to him that if he led an army against the , he would destroy a great empire. Therefore he ought, if he had wanted to plan well, to have sent and asked whether the god spoke of ' or of ' empire. But he did not understood what was spoken, or make further inquiry: for which now let him blame himself.\nWhen he asked that last question of the oracle and  gave him that answer concerning the mule, even that  did not understand. For that mule was in fact , who was the son of two parents not of the same people, of whom the mother was better and the father inferior:\n\nfor she was a  and the daughter of  king of the ; but he was a  and a subject of the  and although in all respects her inferior he married this lady of his. This was the answer of the priestess to the . They carried it to  and told , and when he heard it, he confessed that the sin was not the god's, but his. And this is the story of ' rule, and of the first overthrow of .\n\n\nThere are many offerings of ' in , and not only those of which I have spoken. There is a golden tripod at  in , which he dedicated to  of ; at  there are the oxen of gold and the greater part of the pillars; and in the temple of  at , a golden shield. All these survived to my lifetime; but other of the offerings were destroyed.\nAnd the offerings of  at  of the , as I learn by inquiry, are equal in weight and like those at . Those which he dedicated at  and the shrine of  were his own, the first-fruits of the wealth inherited from his father; the rest came from the estate of an enemy who had headed a faction against  before he became king, and conspired to win the throne of  for .\nThis  was a son of , and half-brother of :  was ' son by a  and  by an  mother.\nSo when  gained the sovereignty by his father's gift, he put the man who had conspired against him to death by drawing him across a carding-comb, and first confiscated his estate, then dedicated it as and where I have said. This is all that I shall say of ' offerings.\n\n\nThere are not many marvellous things in  to record, in comparison with other countries, except the gold dust that comes down from .\nBut there is one building to be seen there which is much the greatest of all, except those of  and . In  is the tomb of , the father of , the base of which is made of great stones and the rest of it of mounded earth. It was built by the men of the market and the craftsmen and the prostitutes.\nThere survived until my time five corner-stones set on the top of the tomb, and in these was cut the record of the work done by each group: and measurement showed that the prostitutes' share of the work was the greatest.\nAll the daughters of the common people of  ply the trade of prostitutes, to collect dowries, until they can get themselves husbands; and they themselves offer themselves in marriage.\nNow this tomb has a circumference of thirteen hundred and ninety yards, and its breadth is above four hundred and forty yards; and there is a great lake hard by the tomb, which, the  say, is fed by ever-flowing springs; it is called the . Such then is this tomb.\n\n\nThe customs of the  are like those of the , except that they make prostitutes of their female children. They were the first men whom we know who coined and used gold and silver currency; and they were the first to sell by retail.\nAnd, according to what they themselves say, the games now in use among them and the  were invented by the : these, they say, were invented among them at the time when they colonized . This is their story:\nIn the reign of  son of Manes there was great scarcity of food in all . For a while the  bore this with what patience they could; presently, when the famine did not abate, they looked for remedies, and different plans were devised by different men. Then it was that they invented the games of dice and knuckle-bones and ball and all other forms of game except dice, which the  do not claim to have discovered.\nThen, using their discovery to lighten the famine, every other day they would play for the whole day, so that they would not have to look for food, and the next day they quit their play and ate. This was their way of life for eighteen years.\nBut the famine did not cease to trouble them, and instead afflicted them even more. At last their king divided the people into two groups, and made them draw lots, so that the one group should remain and the other leave the country; he himself was to be the head of those who drew the lot to remain there, and his son, whose name was , of those who departed.\nThen the one group, having drawn the lot, left the country and came down to  and built ships, in which they loaded all their goods that could be transported aboard ship, and sailed away to seek a livelihood and a country; until at last, after sojourning with one people after another, they came to the , where they founded cities and have lived ever since.\nThey no longer called themselves , but , after the name of the king's son who had led them there.The , then, were enslaved by the .\n\n\nBut the next business of my history is to inquire who this  was who took down the power of , and how the  came to be the rulers of . I mean then to be guided in what I write by some of the  who desire not to magnify the story of  but to tell the truth, though there are no less than three other accounts of  which I could give.\n\nAfter the  had ruled Upper  for five hundred and twenty years, the  were the first who began to revolt from them. These, it would seem, proved their bravery in fighting for freedom against the ; they cast off their slavery and won freedom. Afterwards, the other subject nations, too, did the same as the .\n\n\nAll of those on the mainland were now free men; but they came to be ruled by monarchs again, as I will now relate. There was among the  a clever man called : he was the son of .\n\n was infatuated with sovereignty, and so he set about gaining it. Already a notable man in his own town (one of the many towns into which Media was divided), he began to profess and practice justice more constantly and zealously than ever, and he did this even though there was much lawlessness throughout the land of Media, and though he knew that injustice is always the enemy of justice. Then the  of the same town, seeing his behavior, chose him to be their judge, and he (for he coveted sovereign power) was honest and just.\nBy acting so, he won no small praise from his fellow townsmen, to such an extent that when the men of the other towns learned that  alone gave fair judgments (having before suffered from unjust decisions), they came often and gladly to plead before ; and at last they would submit to no arbitration but his.\n\n\nThe number of those who came grew ever greater, for they heard that each case turned out in accord with the truth. Then , seeing that everything now depended on him, would not sit in his former seat of judgment, and said he would give no more decisions; for it was of no advantage to him (he said) to leave his own business and spend all day judging the cases of his neighbors.\nThis caused robbery and lawlessness to increase greatly in the towns; and, gathering together, the  conferred about their present affairs, and said (here, as I suppose, the main speakers were ' friends),\n\nSince we cannot go on living in the present way in the land, come, let us set up a king over us; in this way the land will be well governed, and we ourselves shall attend to our business and not be routed by lawlessness. With such words they persuaded themselves to be ruled by a king.\n\n\nThe question was at once propounded: Whom should they make king? Then every man was loud in putting  forward and praising , until they agreed that he should be their king.\nHe ordered them to build him houses worthy of his royal power, and strengthen him with a bodyguard. The  did so. They built him a big and strong house wherever in the land he indicated to them, and let him choose a bodyguard out of all the .\nAnd having obtained power, he forced the  to build him one city and to fortify and care for this more strongly than all the rest. The  did this for him, too. So he built the big and strong walls, one standing inside the next in circles, which are now called .\nThis fortress is so designed that each circle of walls is higher than the next outer circle by no more than the height of its battlements; to which plan the site itself, on a hill in the plain, contributes somewhat, but chiefly it was accomplished by skill.\nThere are seven circles in all; within the innermost circle are the palace and the treasuries; and the longest wall is about the length of the wall that surrounds the city of . The battlements of the first circle are white, of the second black, of the third circle purple, of the fourth blue, and of the fifth orange:\n\nthus the battlements of five circles are painted with colors; and the battlements of the last two circles are coated, the one with silver and the other with gold.\n\n\n built these walls for himself and around his own quarters, and he ordered the people to dwell outside the wall. And when it was all built,  was first to establish the rule that no one should come into the presence of the king, but everything should be done by means of messengers; that the king should be seen by no one; and moreover that it should be a disgrace for anyone to laugh or to spit in his presence.\nHe was careful to hedge himself with all this so that the men of his own age (who had been brought up with him and were as nobly born as he and his equals in courage), instead of seeing him and being upset and perhaps moved to plot against him, might by reason of not seeing him believe him to be different.\n\n\nWhen he had made these arrangements and strengthened himself with sovereign power, he was a hard man in the protection of justice. They would write down their pleas and send them in to him; then he would pass judgment on what was brought to him and send his decisions out.\nThis was his manner of deciding cases at law, and he had other arrangements too; for when he heard that a man was doing violence he would send for him and punish him as each offense deserved: and he had spies and eavesdroppers everywhere in his domain.\n\n\n, then, united the Median nation by itself and ruled it. The  tribes are these: the , the , the , the , the , the . Their tribes are this many.\n\n\n had a son, , who inherited the throne when  died after a reign of fifty-three years. Having inherited it, he was not content to rule the  alone: marching against the , he attacked them first, and they were the first whom he made subject to the .\nThen, with these two strong nations at his back, he subjugated one nation of  after another, until he marched against the ; that is, against those of the  who held . These had formerly been rulers of all; but now their allies had deserted them and they were left alone, though well-off themselves. Marching against these , then,  and most of his army perished, after he had reigned twenty-two years.\n\n\nAt his death he was succeeded by his son . He is said to have been a much greater soldier than his ancestors: it was he who first organized the men of  in companies and posted each arm apart, the spearmen and archers and cavalry: before this they were all mingled together in confusion.\nThis was the king who fought against the  when the day was turned to night in the battle, and who united under his dominion all of  that is beyond the river . Collecting all his subjects, he marched against , wanting to avenge his father and to destroy the city.\nHe defeated the  in battle; but while he was besieging their city, a great army of  came down upon him, led by their king  son of . They had invaded  after they had driven the  out of : pursuing them in their flight, the  came to the Median country.\n\n\nIt is a thirty days' journey for an unencumbered man from the  to the river  and the land of the ; from the  it is an easy matter to cross into Media: there is only one nation between, the ; to pass these is to be in Media.\nNevertheless, it was not by this way that the  entered; they turned aside and came by the upper and much longer way, keeping the  on their right. There, the  met the , who defeated them in battle, deprived them of their rule, and made themselves masters of all .\n\n\nFrom there they marched against : and when they were in the part of  called ,  king of  met them and persuaded them with gifts and prayers to come no further.\nSo they turned back, and when they came on their way to the city of  in , most of the  passed by and did no harm, but a few remained behind and plundered the temple of Heavenly .\nThis temple, I discover from making inquiry, is the oldest of all the temples of the goddess, for the temple in  was founded from it, as the  themselves say; and the temple on  was founded by  from this same land of .\nBut the  who pillaged the temple, and all their descendants after them, were afflicted by the goddess with the female sickness: and so the  say that they are afflicted as a consequence of this and also that those who visit  territory see among them the condition of those whom the  call Hermaphrodites.\n\n\nThe , then, ruled  for twenty-eight years: and the whole land was ruined because of their violence and their pride, for, besides exacting from each the tribute which was assessed, they rode about the land carrying off everyone's possessions.\nMost of them were entertained and made drunk and then slain by  and the : so thus the  took back their empire and all that they had formerly possessed; and they took  (how, I will describe in a later part of my history), and brought all  except the province of  under their rule.\n\n\nAfterwards,  died after a reign of forty years (among which I count the years of the  domination) and his son  inherited the sovereignty. had a daughter, whom he called : he dreamed that she urinated so much that she filled his city and flooded all of . He communicated this vision to those of the  who interpreted dreams, and when he heard what they told him he was terrified;\n\nand presently, when  was of marriageable age, he feared the vision too much to give her to any  worthy to marry into his family, but married her to a  called , a man whom he knew to be wellborn and of a quiet temper: for  held  to be much lower than a  of middle rank.\n\n\nBut during the first year that  was married to ,  saw a second vision. He dreamed that a vine grew out of the genitals of this daughter, and that the vine covered the whole of .\nHaving seen this vision, and communicated it to the interpreters of dreams, he sent to the  for his daughter, who was about to give birth, and when she arrived kept her guarded, meaning to kill whatever child she bore: for the interpreters declared that the meaning of his dream was that his daughter's offspring would rule in his place.\nAnxious to prevent this, , when  was born, summoned , a man of his household who was his most faithful servant among the  and was administrator of all that was his, and he said:\n\n, whatever business I turn over to you, do not mishandle it, and do not leave me out of account and, giving others preference, trip over your own feet afterwards. Take the child that  bore, and carry him to your house, and kill him; and then bury him however you like.\n\nO King,  answered, never yet have you noticed anything displeasing in your man; and I shall be careful in the future, too, not to err in what concerns you. If it is your will that this be done, then my concern ought to be to attend to it scrupulously.\n\n\n answered thus. The child was then given to him, consigned to its death, and he went to his house weeping. When he came in, he told his wife the entire speech uttered by .\n\nNow, then, she said to him, what do you propose to do? Not to obey ' instructions, he answered, not even if he should lose his mind and be more frantic than he is now: I will not lend myself to his plan or be an accessory to such a murder.\nThere are many reasons why I will not kill him: because the child is related to me, and because  is old and has no male children.\nNow if the sovereignty passes to this daughter of his after his death, whose son he is now killing by means of me, what is left for me but the gravest of all dangers? For the sake of my safety this child has to die; but one of ' own people has to be the murderer and not one of mine.\n\n\nSo saying, he sent a messenger at once to one of ' cowherds, who he knew pastured his herds in the likeliest spots and where the mountains were most infested with wild beasts. The man's name was , and his wife was a slave like him; her name was in the  language , in the Median : for spax is the Median word for dog.\nThe foothills of the mountains where this cowherd pastured his cattle are north of , towards the ; for the rest of Media is everywhere a level plain, but here, on the side of the , the land is very high and mountainous and covered with woods.\nSo when the cowherd came in haste at the summons,  said:  wants you to take this child and leave it in the most desolate part of the mountains so that it will perish as quickly as possible. And he wants me to tell you that if you do not kill it, but preserve it somehow, you will undergo the most harrowing death; and I am ordered to see it exposed.\n\n\nHearing this, the cowherd took the child and went back the same way and came to his dwelling. Now as it happened his wife too had been on the verge of delivering every day, and as the divinity would have it, she did in fact give birth while the cowherd was away in the city. Each of them was anxious for the other, the husband being afraid about his wife's labor, and the wife because she did not know why  had so unexpectedly sent for her husband.\nSo when he returned and stood before her, she was startled by the unexpected sight and asked him before he could speak why  had so insistently summoned him. Wife, he said, when I came to the city, I saw and heard what I ought never to have seen, and what ought never to have happened to our masters. ' whole house was full of weeping; astonished, I went in;\n\nand immediately I saw a child lying there struggling and crying, adorned in gold and embroidered clothing. And when  saw me, he told me to take the child in haste and bring it away and leave it where the mountains are the most infested with wild beasts. It was , he said, who enjoined this on me, and  threatened me grievously if I did not do it.\nSo I took him and brought him away, supposing him to be the child of one of the servants; for I could never have guessed whose he was. But I was amazed at seeing him adorned with gold and clothing, and at hearing, too, the evident sound of weeping in the house of .\nVery soon on the way I learned the whole story from the servant who brought me out of the city and gave the child into my custody: namely, that it was the son of  the king's daughter and  the son of , and that  gave the command to kill him. And now, here he is.\n\n\nAnd as he said this the cowherd uncovered it and showed it. But when the woman saw how fine and fair the child was, she began to cry and laid hold of the man's knees and begged him by no means to expose him. But the husband said he could not do otherwise; for, he said, spies would be coming from  to see what was done, and he would have to die a terrible death if he did not obey.\nBeing unable to move her husband, the woman then said: Since I cannot convince you not to expose it, then, if a child has to be seen exposed, do this: I too have borne a child, but I bore it dead.\nTake this one and put it out, but the child of the daughter of  let us raise as if it were our own; this way, you won't be caught disobeying our masters, and we will not have plotted badly. For the dead child will have royal burial, and the living will not lose his life.\n\n\nThinking that his wife advised him excellently in his present strait, the cowherd immediately did as she said. He gave his wife the child whom he had brought to kill, and his own dead child he put into the chest in which he carried the other,\n\nand dressed it with all the other child's finery and left it out in the most desolate part of the mountains. Then on the third day after leaving the child out, the cowherd left one of his herdsmen to watch it and went to the city, where he went to ' house and said he was ready to show the child's dead body.\n\n sent the most trusted of his bodyguard, and these saw for him and buried the cowherd's child. So it was buried: and the cowherd's wife kept and raised the boy who was afterwards named ; but she did not give him that name, but another.\n\n\nNow when the boy was ten years old, the truth about him was revealed in some such way as this. He was playing in the village where these herdsmen's quarters were, playing in the road with others of his age. The boys while playing chose to be their king this one who was supposed to be the son of the cowherd.\nThen he assigned some of them to the building of houses, some to be his bodyguard, one doubtless to be the ; to another he gave the right of bringing him messages; to each he gave his proper work.\nNow one of these boys playing with him was the son of , a notable ; when he did not perform his assignment from ,  told the other boys to seize him, and when they did so he handled the boy very roughly and whipped him.\nAs soon as he was let go, very upset about the indignity he had suffered, he went down to his father in the city and complained of what he had received at the hands of the son of ' cowherdnot calling him , for that name had not yet been given.\n\n, going just as angry as he was to  and bringing his son along, announced that an impropriety had been committed, saying, O King, by your slave, the son of a cowherd, we have been outraged thus: and with that he bared his son's shoulders.\n\n\nWhen  heard and saw, he was ready to avenge the boy in view of ' rank: so he sent for the cowherd and his son. When they were both present,  said, fixing his eyes on ,\n\nIs it you, then, the child of one such as this, who have dared to lay hands on the son of the greatest of my courtiers?  answered, Master, what I did to him I did with justice. The boys of the village, of whom he was one, chose me while playing to be their king, for they thought me the most fit for this.\nThe other boys then did as assigned: but this one was disobedient and cared nothing for me, for which he got what he deserved. Now, if I deserve punishment for this, here I am to take it.\n\n\nWhile the boy spoke, it seemed to  that he recognized him; the character of his face was like his own, he thought, and his manner of answering was freer than customary: and the date of the exposure seemed to agree with the boy's age.\nAstonished at this, he sat a while silent; but when at last with difficulty he could collect his wits, he said (for he wanted to be rid of  and question the cowherd with no one present), I shall act in such a way, , that you and your son shall have no cause of complaint.\nSo he sent  away, and the attendants led  inside at ' bidding. When the cowherd was left quite alone,  asked him where he had got the boy and who had been the giver.\nThe cowherd answered that  was his own son and that the mother was still with him.  said that he was not well advised if he wished to find himself in a desperate situation, and as he said this made a sign to the spearbearers to seize him.\nThen, under stress of necessity, the cowherd disclosed to him the whole story, telling everything exactly as it had happened from the beginning, and at the end fell to entreaty and urged the king to pardon him.\n\n\nWhen the cowherd had disclosed the true story,  took less interest in him, but he was very angry with  and had the guards summon him.\n\n came, and  asked him , how did you kill the boy, my daughter's son, whom I gave you? , when he saw the cowherd was there, did not take the way of falsehood, lest he be caught and confuted:\n\nO King, he said, when I took the boy, I thought and considered how to do what you wanted and not be held a murderer by your daughter or by you even though I was blameless toward you.\nSo I did this: I summoned this cowherd here, and gave the child to him, telling him that it was you who gave the command to kill it. And that was the truth; for such was your command. But I gave the child with the instructions that the cowherd was to lay it on a desolate mountainside and wait there and watch until it was dead; and I threatened all sorts of things if he did not accomplish this.\nThen, when he had done what he was told, and the child was dead, I sent the most trusted of my eunuchs and had the body viewed and buried. This, O king, is the story, and such was the end of the boy.\n\n\n told the story straight, while , hiding the anger that he felt against him for what had been done, first repeated the story again to  exactly as he had heard it from the cowherd, then, after repeating it, ended by saying that the boy was alive and that the matter had turned out well.\n\nFor, he said, I was greatly afflicted by what had been done to this boy, and it weighed heavily on me that I was estranged from my daughter. Now, then, in this good turn of fortune, send your own son to this boy newly come, and (since I am about to sacrifice for the boy's safety to the gods to whom this honor is due) come here to dine with me.\n\n\nWhen  heard this, he bowed and went to his home, very pleased to find that his offense had turned out for the best and that he was invited to dinner in honor of this fortunate day.\nComing in, he told his only son, a boy of about thirteen years of age, to go to ' palace and do whatever the king commanded, and in his great joy he told his wife everything that had happened.\nBut when ' son came,  cut his throat and tore him limb from limb, roasted some of the flesh and boiled some, and kept it ready after he had prepared it.\nSo when the hour for dinner came and the rest of the guests and  were present,  and the others were served dishes of lamb's meat, but  that of his own son, all but the head and hands and feet, which lay apart covered up in a wicker basket.\nAnd when  seemed to have eaten his fill,  asked him, Did you like your meal, ? Exceedingly,  answered. Then those whose job it was brought him the head of his son and hands and feet concealed in the basket, and they stood before  and told him to open and take what he liked.\n\n did; he opened and saw what was left of his son: he saw this, but mastered himself and did not lose his composure.  asked him, Do you know what beast's meat you have eaten?\n\nI know, he said, and all that the king does is pleasing. With that answer he took the remains of the meat and went home. There he meant, I suppose, after collecting everything, to bury it.\n\n\nThus  punished . But, to help him to decide about , he summoned the same  who had interpreted his dream as I have said: and when they came,  asked them how they had interpreted his dream. They answered as before, and said that the boy must have been made king had he lived and not died first.\nThen  said, The boy is safe and alive, and when he was living in the country the boys of his village made him king, and he duly did all that is done by true kings: for he assigned to each individually the roles of bodyguards and sentinels and messengers and everything else, and so ruled. And what do you think is the significance of this?\n\nIf the boy is alive, said the , and has been made king without premeditation, then be confident on this score and keep an untroubled heart: he will not be made king a second time. Even in our prophecies, it is often but a small thing that has been foretold and the consequences of dreams come to nothing in the end.\n\nI too, , said , am very much of your opinion: that the dream came true when the boy was called king, and that I have no more to fear from him. Nevertheless consider well and advise me what will be safest both for my house and for you.\nThe  said, O King, we too are very anxious that your sovereignty prosper: for otherwise, it passes from your nation to this boy who is a , and so we  are enslaved and held of no account by the , as we are of another blood, but while you, our countryman, are established king, we have our share of power, and great honor is shown us by you.\nThus, then, we ought by all means to watch out for you and for your sovereignty. And if at the present time we saw any danger we would declare everything to you: but now the dream has had a trifling conclusion, and we ourselves are confident and advise you to be so also. As for this boy, send him out of your sight to the  and to his parents.\n\n\nHearing this,  was glad, and calling , said, My boy, I did you wrong because of a vision I had in a dream, that meant nothing, but by your own destiny you still live; now therefore, go to the , and good luck go with you; I will send guides with you. When you get there you will find a father and mother unlike the cowherd, , and his wife.\n\n\nAfter saying this,  sent  away. When he returned to ' house, his parents received him there, and learning who he was they welcomed him enthusiastically, for they had supposed that long ago he had been killed, and they asked him how his life had been saved.\nThen he told them, and said that until now he had known nothing but been very deceived, but that on the way he had heard the whole story of his misfortune; for he had thought, he said, that ' cowherd was his father, but in his journey from the city his escort had told him the whole story.\nAnd he had been raised, he said, by the cowherd's wife, and he was full of her praises, and in his tale he was constantly speaking of . Hearing this name, his parents circulated a story that  was suckled by a dog when exposed, thinking in this way to make the story of his salvation seem more marvellous to the .\n\n\nThis then was the beginning of that legend. But as  grew up to be the manliest and best loved of his peers,  courted him and sent him gifts, wishing to be avenged on ; for he saw no hope for a private man like himself of punishing , but as he saw  growing up, he tried to make him an ally, for he likened ' misfortune to his own.\nEven before this the following had been done by him: since  was harsh toward the , he associated with each of the chief  and persuaded them to make  their leader and depose .\nSo much being ready and done,  wanted to reveal his intent to , who then lived among the . But the roads were guarded, and he had no plan for sending a message but this:\n\nhe carefully slit the belly of a hare, and then leaving it as it was without further harm he put into it a paper on which he wrote what he thought best. Then he sewed up the hare's belly, and sent it to  by the most trusted of his servants, giving him nets to carry as if he were a huntsman. The messenger was instructed to give  the hare and tell him by word of mouth to cut it open with his own hands, with no one else present.\n\n\nAll this was done.  took the hare and slit it and read the paper which was in it; the writing was as follows: Son of , since the gods watch over you (otherwise you would not have prospered so) avenge yourself now on , your murderer;\n\nfor thanks to his intention you are dead, while thanks to the gods, and me, you live. I expect that long ago you heard the story of what was done concerning you and how  treated me because I did not kill you but gave you to the cowherd. If, then, you will listen to me, you shall rule all the country which is now ruled by . Persuade the  to rebel, and lead their army against the ;\n\nthen you have your wish, whether I am appointed to command the army against you or some other notable man among the : for they will of themselves revolt from  and join you and try to pull him down. Seeing then that all is ready here, do as I say and do it quickly.\n\n\nWhen  read this, he deliberated as to what was the shrewdest way to persuade the  to revolt; and what he thought to be most effective, he did:\n\nwriting what he liked on a paper, he assembled the , and then unfolded the paper and declared that in it  appointed him leader of the  armies. Now, he said in his speech, I command you, men of , to come, each provided with a sickle. This is what  said.\nNow there are many tribes in : those of them that  assembled and persuaded to revolt from the  were the , the , and the . On these all the other  depend. The chief tribe is that of the ; to them belongs the clan of the , the royal house of .\nThe other  tribes are the , the , and the , all tillers of the soil, and the , the , the , the , all wandering herdsmen.\n\n\nSo when they all came with sickles as ordered,  commanded them to reclaim in one day a thorny tract of , of two and one quarter or two and one half miles each way in extent.\nThe  accomplished the task appointed;  then commanded them to wash themselves and come the next day; meanwhile, collecting his father's goats and sheep and oxen in one place, he slaughtered and prepared them as a feast for the  host, providing also wine and all the foods that were most suitable.\nWhen the  came on the next day he had them sit and feast in a meadow. After dinner he asked them which they liked more: their task of yesterday or their present pastime.\nThey answered that the difference was great: all yesterday they had had nothing but evil, to-day nothing but good. Then, taking up their word,  laid bare his whole purpose, and said:\n\nThis is your situation, men of : obey me and you shall have these good things and ten thousand others besides with no toil and slavery; but if you will not obey me, you will have labors unnumbered like your toil of yesterday.\nNow, then, do as I tell you, and win your freedom. For I think that I myself was born by a divine chance to undertake this work; and I hold you fully as good men as the  in war and in everything else. All this is true; therefore revolt from  quickly now!\n\n\nThe  had long been discontent that the  ruled them, and now having got a champion they were glad to win their freedom. But when  heard that  was about this business, he sent a messenger to summon him;\n\n told the messenger to take back word that  would see him sooner than he liked. Hearing this,  armed all his , and was distracted by Providence so that he forgot what he had done to , and appointed him to command the army.\nSo when the  marched out and engaged with the , those who were not in on the plan fought, while others deserted to the enemy, and most were deliberate cowards and ran.\n\n\nThus the Median army was shamefully scattered. As soon as  heard, he sent a threatening message to : Nevertheless,  shall not rejoice;\n\nand with that he took the  who interpreted dreams, who had persuaded him to let  go free, and impaled them; then he armed the  who were left in the city, the very young and very old men.\nLeading these out, and engaging the , he was beaten:  himself was taken prisoner, and lost the Median army which he led.\n\n\nWhen  was a captive,  came and exulted over him and taunted him, and besides much other bitter mockery he recalled his banquet, when  had fed  his son's flesh, and asked  what it was like to be a slave after having been a king.\nFixing his gaze on ,  asked, Do you imagine that this, which  has done, is your work? It was I, said the other, who wrote the letter; the accomplishment of the work is rightly mine.\n\nThen, said , you stand confessed the most foolish and most unjust man on earth; most foolish, in giving another the throne which you might have had for yourself, if the present business is indeed your doing; most unjust, in enslaving the  because of that banquet.\nFor if in any event another and not you had to possess the royal power, then in justice some  should have had it, not a : but now you have made the , who did you no harm, slaves instead of masters and the , who were the slaves, are now the masters of the .\n\n\nThus  was deposed from his sovereignty after a reign of thirty-five years: and the  had to bow down before the  because of ' cruelty. They had ruled all  beyond the  for one hundred and twenty-eight years, from which must be subtracted the time when the  held sway.\nAt a later time they repented of what they now did, and rebelled against  ; but they were defeated in battle and brought back into subjection. But now, in ' time,  and the  rose in revolt against the , and from this time ruled .\nAs for ,  did him no further harm, and kept him in his own house until  died.This is the story of the birth and upbringing of , and of how he became king; and afterwards, as I have already related, he subjugated  in punishment for the unprovoked wrong done him; and after this victory he became sovereign of all .\n\n\nAs to the customs of the , I know them to be these. It is not their custom to make and set up statues and temples and altars, but those who do such things they think foolish, because, I suppose, they have never believed the gods to be like men, as the  do;\n\nbut they call the whole circuit of heaven , and to him they sacrifice on the highest peaks of the mountains; they sacrifice also to the sun and moon and earth and fire and water and winds.\nFrom the beginning, these are the only gods to whom they have ever sacrificed; they learned later to sacrifice to the heavenly  from the  and . She is called by the  , by the  , by the  .\n\n\nAnd this is their method of sacrifice to the aforesaid gods: when about to sacrifice, they do not build altars or kindle fire, employ libations, or music, or fillets, or barley meal: when a man wishes to sacrifice to one of the gods, he leads a beast to an open space and then, wearing a wreath on his tiara, of myrtle usually, calls on the god.\nTo pray for blessings for himself alone is not lawful for the sacrificer; rather, he prays that the king and all the  be well; for he reckons himself among them. He then cuts the victim limb from limb into portions, and, after boiling the flesh, spreads the softest grass, trefoil usually, and places all of it on this.\nWhen he has so arranged it, a  comes near and chants over it the song of the birth of the gods, as the  tradition relates it; for no sacrifice can be offered without a . Then after a little while the sacrificer carries away the flesh and uses it as he pleases.\n\n\nThe day which every man values most is his own birthday. On this day, he thinks it right to serve a more abundant meal than on other days: oxen or horses or camels or asses, roasted whole in ovens, are set before the rich; the poorer serve the lesser kinds of cattle.\nTheir courses are few, the dainties that follow many, and not all served together. This is why the  say of  that they rise from table still hungry, because not much dessert is set before them: were this too given to  (the  say) they would never stop eating.\nThey are very partial to wine. No one may vomit or urinate in another's presence: this is prohibited among them. Moreover, it is their custom to deliberate about the gravest matters when they are drunk;\n\nand what they approve in their deliberations is proposed to them the next day, when they are sober, by the master of the house where they deliberate; and if, being sober, they still approve it, they act on it, but if not, they drop it. And if they have deliberated about a matter when sober, they decide upon it when they are drunk.\n\n\nWhen one man meets another on the road, it is easy to see if the two are equals; for, if they are, they kiss each other on the lips without speaking; if the difference in rank is small, the cheek is kissed; if it is great, the humbler bows and does obeisance to the other.\nThey honor most of all those who live nearest them, next those who are next nearest, and so going ever onwards they assign honor by this rule: those who dwell farthest off they hold least honorable of all; for they think that they are themselves in all regards by far the best of all men, that the rest have only a proportionate claim to merit, until those who live farthest away have least merit of all.\nUnder the rule of the , one tribe would even govern another; the  held sway over all alike and especially over those who lived nearest to them; these ruled their neighbors, and the neighbors in turn those who came next to them, on the same scheme by which the  assign honor; for the nation kept advancing its rule and dominion.\n\n\nBut the  more than all men welcome foreign customs. They wear the Median dress, thinking it more beautiful than their own, and the  cuirass in war. Their luxurious practices are of all kinds, and all borrowed: the  taught them pederasty. Every  marries many lawful wives, and keeps still more concubines.\n\n\nAfter valor in battle it is accounted noble to father the greatest number of sons: the king sends gifts yearly to him who gets most. Strength, they believe, is in numbers.\nThey educate their boys from five to twenty years old, and teach them only three things: riding and archery and honesty. A boy is not seen by his father before he is five years old, but lives with the women: the point of this is that, if the boy should die in the interval of his rearing, the father would suffer no grief.\n\n\nThis is a law which I praise; and it is a praiseworthy law, too, which does not allow the king himself to slay any one for a single offense, or any other  to do incurable harm to one of his servants for one offense. Not until an accounting shows that the offender's wrongful acts are more and greater than his services may a man give rein to his anger.\nThey say that no one has ever yet killed his father or mother; when such a thing has been done, it always turns out on inquest that the doer is shown to be a changeling or the fruit of adultery; for it is not to be believed (say they) that a son should kill his true parent.\n\n\nFurthermore, of what they may not do, they may not speak, either. They hold lying to be the most disgraceful thing of all and next to that debt; for which they have many other reasons, but this in particular: it is inevitable (so they say) that the debtor also speak some falsehood. The citizen who has leprosy or the white sickness may not come into town or mingle with other . They say that he is so afflicted because he has sinned in some way against the sun.\nEvery stranger who gets such a disease, many drive out of the country; and they do the same to white doves, for the reason given. Rivers they especially revere; they will neither urinate nor spit nor wash their hands in them, nor let anyone else do so.\n\n\nThere is another thing that always happens among them; we have noted it although the  have not: their names, which agree with the nature of their persons and their nobility, all end in the same letter, that which the  call san, and the  sigma; you will find, if you search, that not some but all  names alike end in this letter.\n\n\nSo much I can say of them from my own certain knowledge. But there are other matters concerning the dead which are secretly and obscurely told: how the dead bodies of  are not buried before they have been mangled by birds or dogs.\nThat this is the way of the , I know for certain; for they do not conceal the practice. But this is certain, that before the  bury the body in earth they embalm it in wax. These  are as unlike the priests of  as they are unlike all other men:\n\nfor the priests consider it sacrilege to kill anything that lives, except what they sacrifice; but the  kill with their own hands every creature, except dogs and men; they kill all alike, ants and snakes, creeping and flying things, and take great pride in it. Leaving this custom to be such as it has been from the first, I return now to my former story.\n\n\nAs soon as the  had been subjugated by the , the  and  sent messengers to , offering to be his subjects on the same terms as those which they had under . After hearing what they proposed,  told them a story. Once, he said, there was a flute-player who saw fish in the sea and played upon his flute, thinking that they would come out on to the land.\nDisappointed of his hope, he cast a net and gathered it in and took out a great multitude of fish; and seeing them leaping, You had best, he said, stop your dancing now; you would not come out and dance before, when I played to you.\nThe reason why  told the story to the  and  was that the , who were ready to obey him when the victory was won, had before refused when he sent a message asking them to revolt from .\nSo he answered them in anger. But when the message came to the  in their cities, they fortified themselves with walls, and assembled in the , all except the , with whom alone  made a treaty on the same terms as that which they had with the . The rest of the  resolved to send envoys in the name of them all to , to ask help for the .\n\n\nNow these  possessed the , and of all men whom we know, they happened to found their cities in places with the loveliest of climate and seasons.\nFor neither to the north of them nor to the south does the land effect the same thing as in  nor to the east nor to the west, affected here by the cold and wet, there by the heat and drought.\nThey do not all have the same speech but four different dialects.  lies farthest south among them, and next to it come  and ; these are settlements in , and they have a common language; , , , , , , all of them in ,\n\nhave a language in common which is wholly different from the speech of the three former cities. There are yet three  cities, two of them situated on the islands of  and , and one, , on the mainland; the  and  speak alike, but the  have a language which is their own and no one else's. It is thus seen that there are four modes of speech.\n\n\nAmong these , the  were safe from the danger (for they had made a treaty), and the islanders among them had nothing to fear: for the  were not yet subjects of the , nor were the  themselves mariners.\nBut those of  were cut off from the rest of the  only in the way that I shall show. The whole  stock was then small, and the last of all its branches and the least regarded was the ; for it had no considerable city except .\nNow the  and the rest would not be called , but spurned the name; even now the greater number of them seem to me to be ashamed of it; but the twelve cities aforesaid gloried in this name, and founded a holy place for themselves which they called the , and agreed among themselves to allow no other  to use it (nor in fact did any except the men of  ask to be admitted);\n\n\njust as the  of what is now the country of the formerly the country of the forbid admitting any of the neighboring  to the  temple, and even barred from using it those of their own group who had broken the temple law.\nFor long ago, in the games in honor of , they offered certain bronze tripods to the victors; and those who won these were not to carry them away from the temple but dedicate them there to the god.\nNow when a man of  called  won, he disregarded this law, and, carrying the tripod away, nailed it to the wall of his own house. For this offense the five cities, , , , and forbade the sixth cityto share in the use of the temple. Such was the penalty imposed on the .\n\n\nAs for the , the reason why they made twelve cities and would admit no more was in my judgment this: there were twelve divisions of them when they dwelt in the , just as there are twelve divisions of the  who drove the  out nearest to ; then  and , where is the never-failing river , from which the river in  took its name;  and , where the  fled when they were worsted in battle by the ; ; ; ; ; and , where is the great river ;  and , the only inland city of all thesethese were the twelve divisions of the , as they are now of the .\n\n\nFor this reason, and for no other, the  too made twelve cities; for it would be foolishness to say that these are more truly  or better born than the other ; since not the least part of them are  from , who are not  even in name, and there are mingled with them  of , , ,  renegades from their nation, , ,  of , and many other tribes;\n\nand as for those who came from the very town-hall of  and think they are the best born of the , these did not bring wives with them to their settlements, but married  women whose parents they had put to death.\nFor this slaughter, these women made a custom and bound themselves by oath (and enjoined it on their daughters) that no one would sit at table with her husband or call him by his name, because the men had married them after slaying their fathers and husbands and sons. This happened at .\n\n\nAnd as kings, some of them chose  descendants of  son of , and some  of , descendants of  son of , and some both. Yet since they set more store by the name than the rest of the , let it be granted that those of pure birth are ;\n\nand all are  who are of  descent and keep the feast . All do keep it, except the men of  and ; these are the only  who do not keep it, and these because, they say, of a certain pretext of murder.\n\n\nThe  is a sacred ground in , facing north; it was set apart for  of  by the joint will of the .  is a western promontory of the mainland opposite ; the  used to assemble there from their cities and keep the festival to which they gave the name of .\nNot only the  festivals, but all those of all the  alike, end in the same letter, just as do the names of the .\n\n\nThose are the  cities, and these are the :  (called ), , , , , , , , , , . These are the ancient  cities, eleven in number; but one of them, , was taken away by the ; for these too were once twelve, on the mainland.\nThese  had settled where the land was better than the  territory, but the climate was not so good.\n\n\nNow this is how the  lost . Some men of , the losers in civil strife and exiles from their country, had been received by them into the town. These  exiles waited for the time when the men of  were holding a festival to  outside the walls; then they shut the gates and so got the city.\nThen all the  came to recover it; and an agreement was made, whereby the  would receive back their movable goods from the , and leave the city. After this was done, the other eleven cities divided the  among themselves and made them citizens of their own.\n\n\nThese then are the  cities on the mainland, besides those that are situated on  and are separate.\nAmong those on the islands, five divide  among them (there was a sixth on , , but its people were enslaved by their kinfolk of ); there is one on , and one again in the , as they are called.\nThe men of  and , then, like the  islanders, had nothing to fear. The rest of the cities deliberated together and decided to follow the ' lead.\n\n\nSo when the envoys of the  and  came to  (for they set about this in haste) they chose a , whose name was , to speak for all. He then put on a purple cloak, so that as many  as possible might assemble to hear him, and stood up and made a long speech asking aid for his people.\nBut the  would not listen to him and refused to help the . So the  departed; but the , though they had rejected their envoys, did nevertheless send men in a ship of fifty oars to see (as I suppose) the situation with  and .\nThese, after coming to , sent , who was the most esteemed among them, to , to repeat there to  a proclamation of the , that he was to harm no city on  territory, or else the  would punish him.\n\n\nWhen the herald had proclaimed this,  is said to have asked the  who were present who and how many in number these  were who made this declaration. When he was told, he said to the  herald, I never yet feared men who set apart a place in the middle of their city where they perjure themselves and deceive each other. They, if I keep my health, shall talk of their own misfortunes, not those of the .\nHe uttered this threat against all the , because they have markets and buy and sell there; for the  themselves were not used to resorting to markets at all, nor do they even have a market of any kind.\nPresently, entrusting  to a  called , and instructing , a , to take charge of the gold of  and the , he himself marched away to , taking  with him, and at first taking no notice of the .\nFor he had  on his hands and the  nation and the  and ; he meant to lead the army against these himself, and to send another commander against the .\n\n\nBut no sooner had  marched away from  than  made the  revolt from  and ; and he went down to the sea, where, as he had all the gold of , he hired soldiers and persuaded the men of the coast to join his undertaking. Then, marching to , he penned  in the acropolis and besieged him there.\n\n\nWhen  heard of this on his journey, he said to , What end to this business, ? It seems that the  will never stop making trouble for me and for themselves. It occurs to me that it may be best to make slaves of them; for it seems I have acted like one who slays the father and spares the children.\nSo likewise I have taken with me you who were more than a father to the , and handed the city over to the  themselves; and then indeed I marvel that they revolt! So  uttered his thought; but  feared that he would destroy , and answered him thus:\n\nO King, what you say is reasonable. But do not ever yield to anger, or destroy an ancient city that is innocent both of the former and of the present offense. For the former I am responsible, and bear the punishment on my head; while , in whose charge you left , does this present wrong; let him, then, pay the penalty.\nBut pardon the , and give them this command so that they not revolt or pose a danger to you: send and forbid them to possess weapons of war, and order them to wear tunics under their cloaks and knee-boots on their feet, and to teach their sons lyre-playing and song and dance and shop-keeping. And quickly, O king, you shall see them become women instead of men, so that you need not fear them, that they might revolt.\n\n\n proposed this to him, because he thought this was better for the  than to be sold as slaves; he knew that without some reasonable plea he could not change the king's mind, and feared that even if the  should escape this time they might later revolt and be destroyed by the .\n\n was pleased by this counsel; he relented in his anger and said he would follow ' advice. Then calling , a , he told him to give the  the commands that  advised; further, to enslave all the others who had joined the  in attacking ; and as for  himself, by all means to bring him into his presence alive.\n\n\nAfter giving these commands on his journey, he marched away into the  country. But , learning that an army sent against him was approaching, was frightened and fled to .\n\n the , when he came to  with the part that he had of ' host and found ' followers no longer there, first of all compelled the  to carry out ' commands; and by his order they changed their whole way of life.\nAfter this, he sent messengers to  demanding that  be surrendered. The  resolved to make the god at  their judge as to what course they should take; for there was an ancient place of divination there, which all the  and  used to consult; the place is in the land of , above the harbor of .\n\n\nThe men of , then, sent to  to inquire of the shrine what they should do in the matter of  that would be most pleasing to the gods; and the oracle replied that they must surrender  to the .\nWhen this answer came back to them, they set about surrendering him. But while the greater part were in favor of doing this,  son of , a notable man among the citizens, stopped the men of  from doing it; for he did not believe the oracle and thought that those who had inquired of the god spoke falsely; until at last a second band of inquirers was sent to inquire concerning , among whom was .\n\n\nWhen they came to , , speaking for all, put this question to the oracle: Lord,  the  has come to us a suppliant fleeing a violent death at the hands of the ; and they demand him of us, telling the men of  to surrender him.\nBut we, as much as we fear the  power, have not dared give up this suppliant of ours until it is clearly made known to us by you whether we are to do this or not. Thus  inquired; and the god again gave the same answer, that  should be surrendered to the .\nWith that  did as he had already decided; he went around the temple, and took away the sparrows and all the families of nesting birds that were in it. But while he was doing so, a voice (they say) came out of the inner shrine calling to , and saying, Vilest of men, how dare you do this? Will you rob my temple of those that take refuge with me?\nThen  had his answer ready: Lord, he said, will you save your own suppliants, yet tell the men of  to deliver up theirs? But the god replied, Yes, I do command them, so that you may perish all the sooner for your impiety, and never again come to inquire of my oracle about giving up those that seek refuge with you.\n\n\nWhen the  heard this answer, they sent  away to ; for they were anxious not to perish for delivering him up or to be besieged for keeping him with them.\nThen  sent a message to  demanding the surrender of , and the  prepared to give him, for a price; I cannot say exactly how much it was, for the bargain was never fulfilled;\n\nfor when the  learned what the  were about, they sent a ship to  and took  away to . From there he was dragged out of the temple of  and delivered up by the ,\n\nwho received in return , which is a district in  opposite . The  thus received  and kept him guarded, so that they might show him to ;\n\nand for a long time no one would use barley meal from this land of  in sacrifices to any god, or make sacrificial cakes of what grew there; everything that came from that country was kept away from any sacred rite.\n\n\nThe , then, surrendered , and afterwards  led his army against those who had helped to besiege , and he enslaved the people of , and overran the plain of the , giving it to his army to pillage and  likewise. Immediately after this he died of an illness.\n\n\nAfter his death, , a  like , came down to succeed him in his command; this is the  who was entertained by  the king of the  at that unnatural feast, and who helped win the kingship for .\nThis man was now made general by . When he came to , he took the cities by means of earthworks; he would drive the men within their walls and then build earthworks against the walls and so take the cities.\n\n\n was the first  town that he attacked. These  were the earliest of the  to make long sea-voyages, and it was they who discovered the , and , and , and ,\n\nnot sailing in round freightships but in fifty-oared vessels. When they came to  they made friends with the king of the , whose name was ; he ruled  for eighty years and lived a hundred and twenty.\nThe  won this man's friendship to such a degree that he invited them to leave  and settle in his country wherever they liked; and then, when he could not persuade them to, and learned from them how the Median power was increasing, he gave them money to build a wall around their city.\nHe gave it generously: for the circuit of the wall is of not a few stades, and all this is made of great stones well fitted together.\n\n\nIn such a manner the ' wall was built.  marched against the city and besieged it, but he made overtures, and said that it would suffice him if the  would demolish one rampart of the wall and dedicate one house.\nBut the , very indignant at the thought of slavery, said they wanted to deliberate for a day, and then they would answer; but while they were deliberating,  must withdraw his army from the walls, they said.  said that he well knew what they intended to do, but that nevertheless he would allow them to deliberate.\nSo when  withdrew his army from the walls, the  launched their fifty-oared ships, embarked their children and women and all their movable goods, besides the statues from the temples and everything dedicated in them except bronze or stonework or painting, and then embarked themselves and set sail for ; and the  took , left thus uninhabited.\n\n\nThe  would have bought the islands called  from the ; but the  would not sell them, because they feared that the islands would become a market and so their own island be cut off from trade: so the  prepared to sail to , where at the command of an oracle they had built a city called  twenty years before.\n\n was by this time dead. While getting ready for their voyage, they first sailed to , where they destroyed the  guard to whom  had entrusted the defense of the city; and when this was done, they called down mighty curses on any one of them who should stay behind when the rest sailed.\nNot only this, but they sank a mass of iron in the sea, and swore never to return to  before the iron should appear again. But while they prepared to sail to , more than half of the citizens were overcome with longing and pitiful sorrow for the city and the life of their land, and they broke their oath and sailed back to . Those of them who kept the oath put out to sea from the .\n\n\nAnd when they came to  they lived there for five years as one community with those who had come first, and they founded temples there. But they harassed and plundered all their neighbors, as a result of which the  and  made common cause against them, and sailed to attack them with sixty ships each.\nThe  also manned their ships, sixty in number, and met the enemy in the sea called . They engaged and the  won, yet it was only a kind of  victory; for they lost forty of their ships, and the twenty that remained were useless, their rams twisted awry.\nThen sailing to  they took their children and women and all of their possessions that their ships could hold on board, and leaving  they sailed to .\n\n\nAs for the crews of the disabled ships, the  and  drew lots for them, and of the  the  were allotted by far the majority and these they led out and stoned to death. But afterwards, everything from  that passed the place where the stoned  lay, whether sheep or beasts of burden or men, became distorted and crippled and palsied.\nThe  sent to , wanting to mend their offense; and the  priestess told them to do what the people of  do to this day: for they pay great honors to the , with religious rites and games and horse-races.\nSuch was the end of this part of the . Those of them who fled to  set out from there and gained possession of that city in the  country which is now called ;\n\nthey founded this because they learned from a man of  that the  whose establishment the  priestess ordained was the hero, and not the island.\n\n\nThus, then, it went with the . The  did the same things as the : when  had taken their walled city by building an earthwork, they all embarked aboard ship and sailed away for . There they founded a city, , which before this had been founded by  of ; yet he got no profit of it, but was driven out by the . This  is now honored as a hero by the  of .\n\n\nThese were the only  who left their native lands, unable to endure slavery. The rest of the , except the , though they faced  in battle as did the exiles, and conducted themselves well, each fighting for his own country, yet, when they were defeated and their cities taken, they remained where they were and did as they were told.\nThe , as I have already said, made a treaty with  himself and struck no blow. Thus  was enslaved for the second time: and when  had conquered the  of the mainland, the  of the islands, fearing the same fate, surrendered to .\n\n\nWhen the , despite their evil plight, nonetheless assembled at the ,  of , I have learned, gave them very useful advice, and had they followed it they might have been the most prosperous of all :\n\nfor he advised them to put out to sea and sail all together to  and then found one city for all : thus, possessing the greatest island in the world and ruling others, they would be rid of slavery and have prosperity; but if they stayed in  he could see (he said) no hope of freedom for them.\nThis was the advice which  of  gave after the destruction of the ; and that given before the destruction by  of , a  by descent, was good too; he advised that the  have one place of deliberation, and that it be in  (for that was the center of ), and that the other cities be considered no more than demes.Thus  and  advised.\n\n\n, after subjugating , made an expedition against the , , and , taking  and  with him.\nOf these, the  have come to the mainland from the islands; for in the past they were islanders, called  and under the rule of , not (as far as I can learn by report) paying tribute, but manning ships for him when he needed them.\nSince  had subjected a good deal of territory for himself and was victorious in war, this made the  too at that time by far the most respected of all nations.\nThey invented three things in which they were followed by the : it was the  who originated wearing crests on their helmets and devices on their shields, and who first made grips for their shields; until then all who used shields carried them without these grips, and guided them with leather belts which they slung round the neck and over the left shoulder.\nThen, a long time afterwards, the  were driven from the islands by  and  and so came to the mainland. This is the  story about the ; but the  themselves do not subscribe to it, but believe that they are aboriginal inhabitants of the mainland and always bore the name which they bear now;\n\nand they point to an ancient shrine of  at , to which  and , as brethren of the  (for  and , they say, were brothers of ), are admitted, but not those who spoke the same language as the  but were of another people.\n\n\nI think the  are aborigines of the soil, but they say that they came from . Their speech has become like the , or the  like theirs (for I cannot clearly decide), but in their customs they diverge widely from the , as from all other men. Their chief pleasure is to assemble for drinking-bouts in groups according to their ages and friendships: men, women, and children.\nCertain foreign rites of worship were established among them; but afterwards, when they were inclined otherwise, and wanted to worship only the gods of their fathers, all  men of full age put on their armor and went together as far as the boundaries of , striking the air with their spears and saying that they were casting out the alien gods.\n\n\nSuch are their ways. The  were from  in ancient times (for in the past none that lived on  were ).\nNow there was a dispute in  about the royal power between  and , sons of ;  prevailed in this dispute and drove out  and his partisans; who, after being driven out, came to the  land in . What is now possessed by the  was in the past , and the  were then called .\nFor a while  ruled them, and the people were called , which was the name that they had brought with them and that is still given to the  by their neighbors; but after  son of  came from banished as well by his brother, to join  in the land of the , they came in time to be called  after .\nTheir customs are partly  and partly . But they have one which is their own and shared by no other men: they take their names not from their fathers but from their mothers,\n\nand when one is asked by his neighbor who he is, he will say that he is the son of such a mother, and rehearse the mothers of his mother. Indeed, if a female citizen marries a slave, her children are considered pure-blooded; but if a male citizen, even the most prominent of them, takes an alien wife or concubine, the children are dishonored.\n\n\nNeither the  nor any  who dwell in this country did any thing notable before they were all enslaved by .\nAmong those who inhabit it are certain , colonists from . Their country (it is called the ) lies between the sea and that part of the peninsula which belongs to , and all but a small part of the  territory is washed by the sea\n\n(for it is bounded on the north by the gulf of , and on the south by the sea off  and ). Now while  was conquering , the  dug a trench across this little space, which is about two-thirds of a mile wide, in order that their country might be an island. So they brought it all within the entrenchment; for the frontier between the  country and the mainland is on the isthmus across which they dug.\nMany of them were at this work; and seeing that the workers were injured when breaking stones more often and less naturally than usual, some in other ways, but most in the eyes, the  sent envoys to  to inquire what it was that opposed them.\nThen, as they themselves say, the priestess gave them this answer in iambic verse:\n\n\nAt this answer from the priestess, the  stopped their digging, and when  came against them with his army they surrendered to him without resistance.\n\n\nThere were  dwelling inland above ; when any misfortune was approaching them or their neighbors, the priestess of  grew a long beard. This had happened to them thrice. These were the only men near  who held out for long against , and they gave him the most trouble; they fortified a hill called .\n\n\nThe  were at length taken, and when  led his army into the plain of , the  came out to meet him, and showed themselves courageous fighting few against many; but being beaten and driven into the city, they gathered their wives and children and goods and servants into the acropolis, and then set the whole acropolis on fire.\nThen they swore great oaths to each other, and sallying out fell fighting, all the men of .\nOf the  who claim now to be  the greater number, all except eighty households, are of foreign descent; these eighty families as it happened were away from the city at that time, and thus survived. So  gained , and  too in a somewhat similar manner, the  following for the most part the example of the .\n\n\n, then, made havoc of lower ; in the upper country,  himself vanquished every nation, leaving none untouched. Of the greater part of these I will say nothing, but will speak only of those which gave  the most trouble and are most worthy of being described.\n\n\nWhen  had made all the mainland submit to him, he attacked the . In  there are many other great cities, but the most famous and the strongest was , where the royal dwelling had been established after the destruction of .  was a city such as I will now describe.\nIt lies in a great plain, and is in shape a square, each side fifteen miles in length; thus sixty miles make the complete circuit of the city. Such is the size of the city of ; and it was planned like no other city of which we know.\nAround it runs first a moat deep and wide and full of water, and then a wall eighty three feet thick and three hundred thirty three feet high. The royal measure is greater by three fingers' breadth than the common measure.\n\n\nFurther, I must relate where the earth was used as it was dug from the moat and how the wall was constructed. As they dug the moat, they made bricks of the earth which was carried out of the place they dug, and when they had moulded bricks enough, they baked them in ovens;\n\nthen using hot bitumen for cement and interposing layers of wattled reeds at every thirtieth course of bricks, they built first the border of the moat and then the wall itself in the same fashion.\nOn the top, along the edges of the wall, they built houses of a single room, facing each other, with space enough between to drive a four-horse chariot. There are a hundred gates in the circuit of the wall, all of bronze, with posts and lintels of the same.\nThere is another city, called , eight days' journey from , where there is a little river, also named Is, a tributary of the ; from the source of this river Is, many lumps of bitumen rise with the water; and from there the bitumen was brought for the wall of .\n\n\nThus, then, this wall was built; the city is divided into two parts; for it is cut in half by a river named , a wide, deep, and swift river, flowing from  and issuing into the .\nThe angles of the wall, then, on either side are built quite down to the river; here they turn, and from here a fence of baked bricks runs along each bank of the stream.\nThe city itself is full of houses three and four stories high; and the ways that traverse it, those that run crosswise towards the river and the rest, are all straight.\nFurther, at the end of each road there was a gate in the riverside fence, one gate for each alley; these gates also were of bronze, and these too opened on the river.\n\n\nThese walls are the city's outer armor; within them there is another encircling wall, nearly as strong as the other, but narrower.\nIn the middle of one division of the city stands the royal palace, surrounded by a high and strong wall; and in the middle of the other is still to this day the sacred enclosure of , a square of four hundred and forty yards each way, with gates of bronze.\nIn the center of this sacred enclosure a solid tower has been built, two hundred and twenty yards long and broad; a second tower rises from this and from it yet another, until at last there are eight.\nThe way up them mounts spirally outside the height of the towers; about halfway up is a resting place, with seats for repose, where those who ascend sit down and rest.\nIn the last tower there is a great shrine; and in it stands a great and well-covered couch, and a golden table nearby. But no image has been set up in the shrine, nor does any human creature lie there for the night, except one native woman, chosen from all women by the god, as the  say, who are priests of this god.\n\n\nThese same  say (though I do not believe them) that the god himself is accustomed to visit the shrine and rest on the couch, as in \n of , as the  say\n\n(for there too a woman sleeps in the temple of , and neither the  nor the  woman, it is said, has intercourse with men), and as does the prophetess of the god at  in , whenever she is appointed; for there is not always a place of divination there; but when she is appointed she is shut up in the temple during the night.\n\n\nIn the  temple there is another shrine below, where there is a great golden image of , sitting at a great golden table, and the footstool and the chair are also gold; the gold of the whole was said by the  to be eight hundred talents' weight.\nOutside the temple is a golden altar. There is also another great altar, on which are sacrificed the full-grown of the flocks; only nurslings may be sacrificed on the golden altar, but on the greater altar the  even offer a thousand talents' weight of frankincense yearly, when they keep the festival of this god; and in the days of  there was still in this sacred enclosure a statue of solid gold twenty feet high.\nI myself have not seen it, but I relate what is told by the .  son of  proposed to take this statue but dared not;  his son took it, and killed the priest who warned him not to move the statue. Such is the furniture of this temple, and there are many private offerings besides.\n\n\nNow among the many rulers of this city of  (whom I shall mention in my  history) who finished the building of the walls and the temples, there were two that were women. The first of these lived five generations earlier than the second, and her name was : it was she who built dikes on the plain, a notable work; before that the whole plain used to be flooded by the river.\n\n\nThe second queen, whose name was , was a wiser woman than the first. She left such monuments as I shall record; and moreover, seeing that the kingdom of Media was great and restless and  itself among other cities had fallen to it, she took such precautions as she could for her protection.\nFirst she dealt with the river , which flows through the middle of her city; this had been straight before; but by digging canals higher up she made the river so crooked that its course now passes one of the  villages three times; the village which is so approached by the  is called . And now those who travel from our sea to  must spend three days as they float down the  coming three times to the same village.\nSuch was this work; and she built an embankment along either shore of the river, marvellous for its greatness and height.\nThen a long way above  she dug the reservoir of a lake, a little way off from the river, always digging deep enough to find water, and making the circumference a distance of fifty two miles; what was dug out of this hole, she used to embank either edge of the river;\n\nand when she had it all dug, she brought stones and made a quay all around the lake.\nHer purpose in making the river wind and turning the hole into marsh was this: that the current might be slower because of the many windings that broke its force, and that the passages to  might be crooked, and that right after them should come also the long circuit of the lake.\nAll this work was done in that part of the country where the passes are and the shortest road from Media, so that the  might not mix with her people and learn of her affairs.\n\n\nSo she made the deep river her protection; and this work led to another which she added to it. Her city was divided into two parts by the river that flowed through the middle. In the days of the former rulers, when one wanted to go from one part to the other, one had to cross in a boat; and this, I suppose, was a nuisance. But the queen also provided for this; she made another monument of her reign out of this same work when the digging of the basin of the lake was done.\nShe had very long blocks of stone cut; and when these were ready and the place was dug, she turned the course of the river into it, and while it was filling, the former channel now being dry, she bricked the borders of the river in the city and the descent from the gate leading down to the river with baked bricks, like those of the wall; and near the middle of the city she built a bridge with the stones that had been dug up, binding them together with iron and lead.\nEach morning, she laid square-hewn logs across it, on which the  crossed; but these logs were removed at night, lest folk always be crossing over and stealing from one another.\nThen, when the basin she had made for a lake was filled by the river and the bridge was finished,  brought the  back to its former channel out of the lake; thus she had served her purpose, as she thought, by making a swamp of the basin, and her citizens had a bridge made for them.\n\n\nThere was a trick, too, that this same queen contrived. She had a tomb made for herself and set high over the very gate of that entrance of the city which was used most, with writing engraved on the tomb, which read:\n\nIf any king of  in the future is in need of money, let him open this tomb and take as much as he likes: but let him not open it unless he is in need; for it will be the worse for him.\nThis tomb remained untouched until the kingship fell to . He thought it a very strange thing that he should never use this gate, or take the money when it lay there and the writing itself invited him to.\nThe reason he did not use the gate was that the dead body would be over his head as he passed through.\nAfter opening the tomb, he found no money there, only the dead body, with writing which read: If you were ever satisfied with what you had and did not disgrace yourself seeking more, you would not have opened the coffins of the dead. Such a woman, it is recorded, was this queen.\n\n\n, then, marched against ' son, who inherited the name of his father  and the sovereignty of . Now when the  campaigns, he marches well provided with food and flocks from home; and water from the  that flows past  is carried with him, the only river from which the king will drink.\nThis water of the  is boiled, and very many four-wheeled wagons drawn by mules carry it in silver vessels, following the king wherever he goes at any time.\n\n\nWhen  reached the  on his march to , which rises in the mountains of the  and flows through the  country into another river, the , that again passes the city of  and empties into the when, I say,  tried to cross the , which was navigable there, one of his sacred white horses dashed recklessly into the river trying to get through it, but the current overwhelmed him and swept him under and away.\nAt this violence of the river  was very angry, and he threatened to make it so feeble that women could ever after cross it easily without wetting their knees.\nAfter uttering this threat, he paused in his march against , and, dividing his army into two parts, drew lines planning out a hundred and eighty canals running every way from either bank of the ; then he organized his army along the lines and made them dig.\nSince a great multitude was at work, it went quickly; but they spent the whole summer there before it was finished.\n\n\nThen at the beginning of the following spring, when  had punished the  by dividing it among the three hundred and sixty canals, he marched against  at last. The  sallied out and awaited him; and when he came near their city in his march, they engaged him, but they were beaten and driven inside the city.\nThere they had stored provisions enough for very many years, because they knew already that  was not a man of no ambitition, and saw that he attacked all nations alike; so now they were indifferent to the siege; and  did not know what to do, being so long delayed and gaining no advantage.\n\n\nWhether someone advised him in his difficulty, or whether he perceived for himself what to do, I do not know, but he did the following.\nHe posted his army at the place where the river goes into the city, and another part of it behind the city, where the river comes out of the city, and told his men to enter the city by the channel of the  when they saw it to be fordable. Having disposed them and given this command, he himself marched away with those of his army who could not fight;\n\nand when he came to the lake,  dealt with it and with the river just as had the  queen: drawing off the river by a canal into the lake, which was a marsh, he made the stream sink until its former channel could be forded.\nWhen this happened, the  who were posted with this objective made their way into  by the channel of the , which had now sunk to a depth of about the middle of a man's thigh.\nNow if the  had known beforehand or learned what  was up to, they would have let the  enter the city and have destroyed them utterly; for then they would have shut all the gates that opened on the river and mounted the walls that ran along the river banks, and so caught their enemies in a trap.\nBut as it was, the  took them unawares, and because of the great size of the city (those who dwell there say) those in the outer parts of it were overcome, but the inhabitants of the middle part knew nothing of it; all this time they were dancing and celebrating a holiday which happened to fall then, until they learned the truth only too well.\n\n\nAnd , then for the first time, was taken in this way. I shall show how great the power of  is by many other means, but particularly by this. All the land that the great King rules is parcelled out to provision him and his army, and pays tribute besides: now the territory of  feeds him for four of the twelve months in the year, the whole of the rest of  providing for the other eight.\nThus the wealth of  is one third of the entire wealth of . The governorship of this land, which the  call satrapy, is by far the most powerful of all the governorships, since the daily income of  son of , who governed this province by the king's will, was an artaba full of silver\n\n(the artaba is a  measure, containing more than an Attic medimnus by three Attic choenixes), and besides warhorses he had eight hundred stallions in his stables, and sixteen thousand brood mares, each stallion servicing twenty mares.\nMoreover he kept so great a number of  dogs that four great villages of the plain were appointed to provide food for the dogs and exempted from all other burdens. Such were the riches of the governor of .\n\n\nThere is little rain in . This nourishes the roots of the grain; but it is irrigation from the river that ripens the crop and brings the grain to fullness. In , the river itself rises and floods the fields; in , they are watered by hand and by swinging beams.\nFor the whole land of , like , is cut across by canals. The greatest of these is navigable: it runs towards where the sun rises in winter, from the  to another river, the , on which stood the city of . This land is by far the most fertile in grain which we know.\nIt does not even try to bear trees, fig, vine, or olive, but 's grain is so abundant there that it yields for the most part two hundred fold, and even three hundred fold when the harvest is best. The blades of the wheat and barley there are easily four fingers broad;\n\nand for millet and sesame, I will not say to what height they grow, though it is known to me; for I am well aware that even what I have said regarding grain is wholly disbelieved by those who have never visited . They use no oil except what they make from sesame. There are palm trees there growing all over the plain, most of them yielding fruit, from which food is made and wine and honey.\nThe  tend these like figs, and chiefly in this respect, that they tie the fruit of the palm called male by the  to the date-bearing palm, so that the gall-fly may enter the dates and cause them to ripen, and that the fruit of the palm may not fall; for the male palms, like unripened figs, have gall-flies in their fruit.\n\n\nI am going to indicate what seems to me to be the most marvellous thing in the country, next to the city itself. Their boats which ply the river and go to  are all of skins, and round.\nThey make these in , higher up the stream than . First they cut frames of willow, then they stretch hides over these for a covering, making as it were a hold; they neither broaden the stern nor narrow the prow, but the boat is round, like a shield. They then fill it with reeds and send it floating down the river with a cargo; and it is for the most part palm wood casks of wine that they carry down.\nTwo men standing upright steer the boat, each with a paddle, one drawing it to him, the other thrusting it from him. These boats are of all sizes, some small, some very large; the largest of them are of as much as five thousand talents burden. There is a live ass in each boat, or more than one in the larger.\nSo when they have floated down to  and disposed of their cargo, they sell the framework of the boat and all the reeds; the hides are set on the backs of asses, which are then driven back to ,\n\nfor it is not by any means possible to go upstream by water, because of the swiftness of the current; it is for this reason that they make their boats of hides and not of wood. When they have driven their asses back into , they make more boats in the same way.\n\n\nSuch then are their boats. For clothing, they wear a linen tunic, reaching to the feet; over this the  puts on another tunic, of wool, and wraps himself in a white mantle; he wears the shoes of his country, which are like  sandals. Their hair is worn long, and covered by caps; the whole body is perfumed.\nEvery man has a seal and a carved staff, and on every staff is some image, such as that of an apple or a rose or a lily or an eagle: no one carries a staff without an image.\n\n\nThis is the equipment of their persons. I will now speak of their established customs. The wisest of these, in our judgment, is one which I have learned by inquiry is also a custom of the  in . It is this: once a year in every village all the maidens as they attained marriageable age were collected and brought together into one place, with a crowd of men standing around.\nThen a crier would display and offer them for sale one by one, first the fairest of all; and then, when she had fetched a great price, he put up for sale the next most attractive, selling all the maidens as lawful wives. Rich men of  who desired to marry would outbid each other for the fairest; the ordinary people, who desired to marry and had no use for beauty, could take the ugly ones and money besides;\n\nfor when the crier had sold all the most attractive, he would put up the one that was least beautiful, or crippled, and offer her to whoever would take her to wife for the least amount, until she fell to one who promised to accept least; the money came from the sale of the attractive ones, who thus paid the dowry of the ugly and the crippled. But a man could not give his daughter in marriage to whomever he liked, nor could one that bought a girl take her away without giving security that he would in fact make her his wife.\nAnd if the couple could not agree, it was a law that the money be returned. Men might also come from other villages to buy if they so desired.\nThis, then, was their best custom; but it does not continue at this time; they have invented a new one lately so that the women not be wronged or taken to another city; since the conquest of  made them afflicted and poor, everyone of the people that lacks a livelihood prostitutes his daughters.\n\n\nI come now to the next wisest of their customs: having no use for physicians, they carry the sick into the market-place; then those who have been afflicted themselves by the same illness as the sick man's, or seen others in like case, come near and advise him about his disease and comfort him, telling him by what means they have themselves recovered from it or seen others recover. No one may pass by the sick man without speaking and asking after his sickness.\n\n\nThe dead are embalmed in honey for burial, and their dirges are like the dirges of . Whenever a  has had intercourse with his wife, they both sit before a burnt offering of incense, and at dawn they wash themselves; they will touch no vessel before this is done. This is the custom in  also.\n\n\nThe foulest  custom is that which compels every woman of the land to sit in the temple of  and have intercourse with some stranger once in her life. Many women who are rich and proud and disdain to mingle with the rest, drive to the temple in covered carriages drawn by teams, and stand there with a great retinue of attendants.\nBut most sit down in the sacred plot of , with crowns of cord on their heads; there is a great multitude of women coming and going; passages marked by line run every way through the crowd, by which the men pass and make their choice.\nOnce a woman has taken her place there, she does not go away to her home before some stranger has cast money into her lap, and had intercourse with her outside the temple; but while he casts the money, he must say, I invite you in the name of  (that is the  name for ).\nIt does not matter what sum the money is; the woman will never refuse, for that would be a sin, the money being by this act made sacred. So she follows the first man who casts it and rejects no one. After their intercourse, having discharged her sacred duty to the goddess, she goes away to her home; and thereafter there is no bribe however great that will get her.\nSo then the women that are fair and tall are soon free to depart, but the uncomely have long to wait because they cannot fulfill the law; for some of them remain for three years, or four. There is a custom like this in some parts of .\n\n\nThese are established customs among the . Furthermore, there are three tribes in the country that eat nothing but fish, which they catch and dry in the sun; then, after throwing it into a mortar, they pound it with pestles and strain everything through linen. Then whoever desires kneads as it were a cake of it and eats it; others bake it like bread.\n\n\nWhen  had conquered this nation, too, he wanted to subject the . These are said to be a great and powerful people dwelling towards the east and the sunrise, beyond the  and opposite the ; and some say that they are a  people.\n\n\nThe  is said by some to be greater and by some to be less than the . It is reported that there are many islands in it as big as , and men on them who in summer live on roots of all kinds that they dig up, and in winter on fruit that they have got from trees when it was ripe and stored for food;\n\nand they know (it is said) of trees bearing a fruit whose effect is this: gathering in groups and kindling a fire, the people sit around it and throw the fruit into the flames; then the fumes of it as it burns make them drunk as the  are with wine, and more and more drunk as more fruit is thrown on the fire, until at last they rise up to dance and even sing. Such is said to be their way of life.\nThe  flows from the country of the  (as does the , which  divided into the three hundred and sixty channels) and empties itself through forty mouths, of which all except one issue into bogs and swamps, where men are said to live whose food is raw fish, and their customary dress sealskins.\nThe one remaining stream of the  flows in a clear channel into the .This is a sea by itself, not joined to the other sea. For that on which the  sail, and the sea beyond the pillars of , which they call , and the , are all one:\n\n\nbut the  is separate and by itself. Its length is what a ship rowed by oars can traverse in fifteen days, and its breadth, where it is broadest, is an eight days' journey. Along its western shore stretches the range of , which has more and higher peaks than any other range. Many and all kinds of nations dwell in the , and the most of them live on the fruits of the forest.\nHere, it is said, are trees growing leaves that men crush and mix with water and use for painting figures on their clothing; these figures cannot be washed out, but last as long as the wool, as if they had been woven into it from the first. Men and women here (they say) have intercourse openly, like beasts of the flock.\n\n\nThis sea called  is hemmed in to the west by the : towards the east and the sunrise there stretches from its shores a boundless plain as far as the eye can see. The greater part of this wide plain is the country of the , against whom  was eager to lead his army.\nFor there were many weighty reasons that impelled and encouraged him to do so: first, his birth, because of which he seemed to be something more than mortal; and next, his victories in his wars: for no nation that  undertook to attack could escape from him.\n\n\nNow at this time the  were ruled by a queen called , whose husband was dead.  sent a message with a pretence of wanting her for his wife, but  would have none of his advances, well understanding that he wanted not her but the kingdom of the .\nSo when guile was of no avail,  marched to the  and openly prepared to attack the ; he bridged the river for his army to cross, and built towers on the pontoons bridging the river.\n\n\nBut while he was busy at this,  sent a herald to him with this message: O king of the , stop hurrying on what you are hurrying on, for you cannot know whether the completion of this work will be for your advantage. Stop, and be king of your own country; and endure seeing us ruling those whom we rule.\nBut if you will not take this advice, and will do anything rather than remain at peace, then if you so greatly desire to try the strength of the , stop your present work of bridging the river, and let us withdraw three days' journey from the ; and when that is done, cross into our country.\nOr if you prefer to receive us into your country, then withdraw yourself as I have said. Hearing this,  called together the leading  and laid the matter before them, asking them to advise him which he should do. They all spoke to the same end, urging him to let  and her army enter his country.\n\n\nBut  the , who was present, was displeased by their advice and spoke against it. O King, he said, you have before now heard from me that since  has given me to you I will turn aside to the best of my ability whatever misadventure I see threatening your house. And disaster has been my teacher.\nNow, if you think that you and the army that you lead are immortal, I have no business giving you advice; but if you know that you and those whom you rule are only men, then I must first teach you this: men's fortunes are on a wheel, which in its turning does not allow the same man to prosper forever.\nSo, if that is the case, I am not of the same opinion about the business in hand as these other counsellors of yours. This is the danger if we agree to let the enemy enter your country: if you lose the battle, you lose your empire also, for it is plain that if the  win they will not retreat but will march against your provinces.\nAnd if you conquer them, it is a lesser victory than if you crossed into their country and routed the  and pursued them; for I weigh your chances against theirs, and suppose that when you have beaten your adversaries you will march for the seat of ' power.\nAnd besides what I have shown, it would be a shameful thing and not to be endured if  the son of  should yield and give ground before a woman. Now then, it occurs to me that we should cross and go forward as far as they draw back, and that then we should endeavor to overcome them by doing as I shall show.\nAs I understand, the  have no experience of the good things of , and have never fared well as to what is greatly desirable. Therefore, I advise you to cut up the meat of many of your sheep and goats into generous portions for these men, and to cook it and serve it as a feast in our camp, providing many bowls of unmixed wine and all kinds of food.\nThen let your army withdraw to the river again, leaving behind that part of it which is of least value. For if I am not mistaken in my judgment, when the  see so many good things they will give themselves over to feasting on them; and it will be up to us then to accomplish great things.\n\n\nSo these opinions clashed; and  set aside his former plan and chose that of ; consequently, he told  to draw her army off, for he would cross (he said) and attack her; so she withdrew as she had promised before. Then he entrusted  to the care of his own son , to whom he would leave his sovereignty, telling  to honor  and treat him well if the crossing of the river against the  should not go well. With these instructions, he sent the two back to , and he and his army crossed the river.\n\n\nAfter he had crossed the , he dreamed that night while sleeping in the country of the  that he saw the eldest of ' sons with wings on his shoulders, the one wing overshadowing  and the other .\n\n son of  was an , and  was the eldest of his sons, then about twenty years old; this  had been left behind in , not yet being of an age to go on campaign.\nSo when  awoke he considered his vision, and because it seemed to him to be of great importance, he sent for  and said to him privately, , I have caught your son plotting against me and my sovereignty; and I will tell you how I know this for certain.\nThe gods care for me and show me beforehand all that is coming. Now then, I have seen in a dream in the past night your eldest son with wings on his shoulders, overshadowing  with the one and  with the other.\nFrom this vision, there is no way that he is not plotting against me. Therefore hurry back to , and see that when I come back after subjecting this country you bring your son before me to be questioned about this.\n\n\n said this, thinking that  was plotting against him; but in fact, heaven was showing him that he himself was to die in the land where he was and  inherit his kingdom.\nSo then  replied with this: O King, may there not be any  born who would plot against you! But if there is, may he perish suddenly; for you have made the  free men instead of slaves and rulers of all instead of subjects of any.\nBut if your vision does indeed signify that my son is planning revolution, I give him to you to treat as you like.\n\n\nAfter having given this answer and crossed the ,  went to  to watch his son for ; and , advancing a day's journey from the , acted according to ' advice.\n\n and the sound portion of the  army marched back to the , leaving behind those that were useless; a third of the  forces attacked those of the army who were left behind and destroyed them despite resistance; then, when they had overcome their enemies, seeing the banquet spread they sat down and feasted, and after they had had their fill of food and wine, they fell asleep.\nThen the  attacked them, killing many and taking many more alive, among whom was the son of  the queen,  by name, the leader of the .\n\n\nWhen  heard what had happened to her army and her son, she sent a herald to  with this message:\n\n who can never get enough blood, do not be elated by what you have done; it is nothing to be proud of if, by the fruit of the vinewith which you  fill yourselves and rage so violently that evil words rise in a flood to your lips when the wine enters your bodiesif, by tricking him with this drug, you got the better of my son, and not by force of arms in battle.\nNow, then, take a word of good advice from me: give me back my son and leave this country unpunished, even though you have savaged a third of the  army. But if you will not, then I swear to you by the sun, lord of the , that I shall give even you who can never get enough of it your fill of blood.\n\n\n dismissed this warning when it was repeated to him. But , the son of the queen , after the wine wore off and he recognized his evil plight, asked  to be freed from his bonds; and this was granted him; but as soon as he was freed and had the use of his hands, he did away with himself.\n\n\nSuch was the end of . , when  would not listen to her, collected all her forces and engaged him. This fight I judge to have been the fiercest ever fought by men that were not ; and indeed I have learned that this was so.\nFor first (it is said) they shot arrows at each other from a distance; then, when their arrows were all spent, they rushed at each other and fought with their spears and swords; and for a long time they stood fighting and neither would give ground; but at last the  got the upper hand.\nThe greater part of the  army was destroyed there on the spot, and  himself fell there, after having reigned for one year short of thirty years.\n\n filled a skin with human blood, and searched among the  dead for ' body; and when she found it, she pushed his head into the skin, and insulted the dead man in these words:\n\nThough I am alive and have defeated you in battle, you have destroyed me, taking my son by guile; but just as I threatened, I give you your fill of blood. Many stories are told of ' death; this, that I have told, is the most credible.\n\n\nThese  are like the  in their dress and way of life. They are both cavalry and infantry (having some of each kind), and spearmen and archers; and it is their custom to carry battle-axes. They always use gold and bronze; all their spear-points and arrow-heads and battle-axes are bronze and the adornment of their headgear and belts and girdles is gold.\nThey equip their horses similarly, protecting their chests with bronze breastplates and putting gold on reins, bits, and cheekplates. But they never use iron and silver, for there is none at all in their country, but gold and bronze abound.\n\n\nNow for their customs: each man marries a wife, but the wives are common to all. The  say this is a  custom; it is not, but a custom of the . There, when a man desires a woman, he hangs his quiver before her wagon, and has intercourse with her without fear.\nThough they fix no certain term to life, yet when a man is very old all his family meet together and kill him, with beasts of the flock besides, then boil the flesh and feast on it.\nThis is held to be the happiest death; when a man dies of an illness, they do not eat him, but bury him in the earth, and lament that he did not live to be killed. They never plant seed; their fare is their livestock and the fish which they take in abundance from the .\nTheir drink is milk. The sun is the only god whom they worship; they sacrifice horses to him; the reasoning is that he is the swiftest of the gods, and therefore they give him the swiftest of mortal things."}}, {"@type":

He considered the  and  slaves inherited from his father, and prepared an expedition against , taking with him some of these  subjects besides others whom he ruled.\n\n\nNow before  became king of , the  believed that they were the oldest people on earth. But ever since  became king and wished to find out which people were the oldest, they have believed that the  were older than they, and they than everybody else.\n\n, when he was in no way able to learn by inquiry which people had first come into being, devised a plan by which he took two newborn children of the common people and gave them to a shepherd to bring up among his flocks. He gave instructions that no one was to speak a word in their hearing; they were to stay by themselves in a lonely hut, and in due time the shepherd was to bring goats and give the children their milk and do everything else necessary.\n\n did this, and gave these instructions, because he wanted to hear what speech would first come from the children, when they were past the age of indistinct babbling. And he had his wish; for one day, when the shepherd had done as he was told for two years, both children ran to him stretching out their hands and calling Bekos! as he opened the door and entered.\nWhen he first heard this, he kept quiet about it; but when, coming often and paying careful attention, he kept hearing this same word, he told his master at last and brought the children into the king's presence as required.  then heard them himself, and asked to what language the word Bekos belonged; he found it to be a  word, signifying bread.\nReasoning from this, the  acknowledged that the  were older than they. This is the story which I heard from the priests of ' temple at ; the  say among many foolish things that  had the children reared by women whose tongues he had cut out.\n\n\nBesides this story of the rearing of the children, I also heard other things at  in conversation with the priests of ; and I visited \n and , too, for this very purpose, because I wished to know if the people of those places would tell me the same story as the priests at ; for the people of  are said to be the most learned of the .\nNow, such stories as I heard about the gods I am not ready to relate, except their names, for I believe that all men are equally knowledgeable about them; and I shall say about them what I am constrained to say by the course of my history.\n\n\nBut as to human affairs, this was the account in which they all agreed: the , they said, were the first men who reckoned by years and made the year consist of twelve divisions of the seasons. They discovered this from the stars (so they said). And their reckoning is, to my mind, a juster one than that of the ; for the  add an intercalary month every other year, so that the seasons agree; but the , reckoning thirty days to each of the twelve months, add five days in every year over and above the total, and thus the completed circle of seasons is made to agree with the calendar.\nFurthermore, the  (they said) first used the names of twelve gods (which the  afterwards borrowed from them); and it was they who first assigned to the several gods their altars and images and temples, and first carved figures on stone. Most of this they showed me in fact to be the case. The first human king of , they said, was .\nIn his time all of  except the  district was a marsh: all the country that we now see was then covered by water, north of , which is seven days' journey up the river from the sea.\n\n\nAnd I think that their account of the country was true. For even if a man has not heard it before, he can readily see, if he has sense, that that  to which the  sail is land deposited for the , the river's giftnot only the lower country, but even the land as far as three days' voyage above the lake, which is of the same nature as the other, although the priests did not say this, too.\nFor this is the nature of the land of : in the first place, when you approach it from the sea and are still a day's sail from land, if you let down a sounding line you will bring up mud from a depth of eleven fathoms. This shows that the deposit from the land reaches this far.\n\n\nFurther, the length of the seacoast of  itself is sixty schoeni of , that is, as we judge it to be, reaching from the  to the , which is under the between these there is this length of sixty schoeni.\nMen that have scant land measure by feet; those that have more, by miles; those that have much land, by parasangs; and those who have great abundance of it, by schoeni.\nThe parasang is three and three quarters miles, and the schoenus, which is an  measure, is twice that.\n\n\nBy this reckoning, then, the seaboard of  will be four hundred and fifty miles in length. Inland from the sea as far as ,  is a wide land, all flat and watery and marshy. From the sea up to  is a journey about as long as the way from the altar of the twelve gods at  to the temple of  at .\nIf a reckoning is made, only a little difference of length, not more than two miles, will be found between these two journeys; for the journey from  to  is two miles short of two hundred, which is the number of miles between the sea and .\n\n\nBeyond and above ,  is a narrow land. For it is bounded on the one side by the mountains of , which run north to south, always running south towards the sea called the . In these mountains are the quarries that were hewn out for making the pyramids at . This way, then, the mountains run, and end in the places of which I have spoken; their greatest width from east to west, as I learned by inquiry, is a two months' journey, and their easternmost boundaries yield frankincense.\nSuch are these mountains. On the side of ,  is bounded by another range of rocky mountains among which are the pyramids; these are all covered with sand, and run in the same direction as those  hills that run southward.\nBeyond , there is no great distancein , that is: the narrow land has a length of only fourteen days' journey up the river. Between the aforesaid mountain ranges, the land is level, and where the plain is narrowest it seemed to me that there were no more than thirty miles between the  and those that are called . Beyond this  is a wide land again. Such is the nature of this country.\n\n\nFrom  to \n is nine days' journey by river, and the distance is six hundred and eight miles, or eighty-one schoeni.\nThis, then, is a full statement of all the distances in : the seaboard is four hundred and fifty miles long; and I will now declare the distance inland from the sea to \n: it is seven hundred and sixty-five miles. And between \n and the city called  there are two hundred and twenty-five miles.\n\n\nThe greater portion, then, of this country of which I have spoken was land deposited for the  as the priests told me, and I myself formed the same judgment; all that lies between the ranges of mountains above  to which I have referred seemed to me to have once been a gulf of the sea, just as the country about  and  and  and the plain of the , to compare these small things with great.\nFor of the rivers that brought down the stuff to make these lands, there is none worthy to be compared for greatness with even one of the mouths of the , and the  has five mouths.\nThere are also other rivers, not so great as the , that have had great effects; I could rehearse their names, but principal among them is the , which, flowing through  and emptying into the sea, has already made half of the  mainland.\n\n\nNow in , not far from , there is a gulf extending inland from the sea called Red , whose length and width are such as I shall show:\n\nin length, from its inner end out to the wide sea, it is a forty days' voyage for a ship rowed by oars; and in breadth, it is half a day's voyage at the widest. Every day the tides ebb and flow in it.\nI believe that where  is now, there was once another such gulf; this extended from the northern sea towards , and the other, the  gulf of which I shall speak, extended from the south towards ; the ends of these gulfs penetrated into the country near each other, and but a little space of land separated them.\nNow, if the  inclined to direct its current into this  gulf, why should the latter not be silted up by it inside of twenty thousand years? In fact, I expect that it would be silted up inside of ten thousand years. Is it to be doubted, then, that in the ages before my birth a gulf even much greater than this should have been silted up by a river so great and so busy?\n\n\nAs for , then, I credit those who say it, and myself very much believe it to be the case; for I have seen that  projects into the sea beyond the neighboring land, and shells are exposed to view on the mountains, and things are coated with salt, so that even the pyramids show it, and the only sandy mountain in  is that which is above ;\n\nbesides,  is like neither the neighboring land of  nor , not even like  (for  inhabit the seaboard of ); it is a land of black and crumbling earth, as if it were alluvial deposit carried down the river from ;\n\nbut we know that the soil of  is redder and somewhat sandy, and  and  are lands of clay and stones.\n\n\nThis, too, that the priests told me about , is a strong proof: when  was king, if the river rose as much as thirteen feet, it watered all of  below .  had not been dead nine hundred years when I heard this from the priests. But now, if the river does not rise at least twenty-six or twenty-five feet, the land is not flooded.\nAnd, in my opinion, the  who inhabit the lands lower down the river than , and especially what is called the Deltaif this land of theirs rises in the same proportion and broadens likewise in extent, and the  no longer floods itwill forever after be in the same straits as they themselves once said the  would be;\n\nfor, learning that all the  land is watered by rain, but not by river water like theirs, they said that one day the  would be let down by what they counted on, and miserably starve: meaning that, if heaven send no rain for the  and afflict them with drought, the  will be overtaken by famine, for there is no other source of water for them except  alone.\n\n\nAnd this prediction of the  about the  was true enough. But now let me show the prospect for the  themselves: if, as I have already said, the country below  (for it is this which rises) should increase in height in the same proportion as formerly, will not the  who inhabit it go hungry, as there is no rain in their country and the river will be unable to inundate their fields?\nAt present, of course, there are no people, either in the rest of  or in the whole world, who live from the soil with so little labor; they do not have to break the land up with the plough, or hoe, or do any other work that other men do to get a crop; the river rises of itself, waters the fields, and then sinks back again; then each man sows his field and sends swine into it to tread down the seed, and waits for the harvest; then he has the swine thresh his grain, and so garners it.\n\n\nNow if we agree with the opinion of the , who say that only the Delta is , and that its seaboard reaches from the so-called  forty schoeni to the Salters' at , while inland it stretches as far as the city of , where the  divides and flows to  and , and that all the rest of  is partly  and partly if we follow this account, we can show that there was once no land for the ;\n\nfor we have seen that (as the  themselves say, and as I myself judge) the Delta is alluvial land and but lately (so to speak) came into being. Then if there was once no land for them, it was an idle notion that they were the oldest nation on earth, and they need not have made that trial to see what language the children would first speak.\nI maintain, rather, that the  did not come into existence together with what the  call the Delta, but have existed since the human race came into being; and as the land grew in extent, there were many of them who stayed behind, and many who spread down over it. Be that as it may, the  district, a land of seven hundred and sixty-five miles in circumference, was in the past called .\n\n\nIf, then, our judgment of this is right, the  are in error concerning ; but if their opinion is right, then it is plain that they and the rest of the  cannot reckon truly, when they divide the whole earth into three parts, , , and ;\n\nthey must add to these a fourth part, the Delta of , if it belongs neither to  nor to ; for by their showing the  is not the river that separates  and ; the  divides at the apex of this Delta, so that this land must be between  and .\n\n\nWe leave the ' opinion aside, and our own judgment about the matter is this:  is all that country which is inhabited by , just as  and  are the countries inhabited by  and , and we know of no boundary line (rightly so called) below  and  except the borders of the .\nBut if we follow the belief of the , we shall consider all  commencing from the Cataracts and the city of  to be divided into two parts, and to claim both the names, the one a part of  and the other of .\nFor the , beginning from the Cataracts, divides  into two parts as it flows to the sea. Now, as far as the city  the  flows in one channel, but after that it parts into three.\nOne of these, which is called the  mouth, flows east; the second flows west, and is called the . But the direct channel of the , when the river in its downward course reaches the apex of the Delta, flows thereafter clean through the middle of the Delta into the sea; in this is seen the greatest and most famous part of its waters, and it is called the .\nThere are also two channels which separate themselves from the  and so flow into the sea: by name, the  and the .\nThe  and  mouths are not natural but excavated channels.\n\n\nThe response of oracle of  in fact bears witness to my opinion, that  is of such an extent as I have argued; I learned this by inquiry after my judgment was already formed about .\nThe men of the cities of  and , in the part of  bordering on , believing themselves to be  and not , and disliking the injunction of the religious law that forbade them to eat cows' meat, sent to  saying that they had no part of or lot with : for they lived (they said) outside the Delta and did not consent to the ways of its people, and they wished to be allowed to eat all foods.\nBut the god forbade them: all the land, he said, watered by the  in its course was , and all who lived lower down than the city  and drank the river's water were . Such was the oracle given to them.\n\n\nWhen the  is in flood, it overflows not only the Delta but also the lands called  and , as far as two days' journey from either bank in places, and sometimes more than this, sometimes less. Concerning its nature, I could not learn anything either from the priests or from any others.\nYet I was anxious to learn from them why the  comes down with a rising flood for a hundred days from the summer solstice; and when this number of days is passed, sinks again with a diminishing stream, so that the river is low for the whole winter until the summer solstice again.\nI was not able to get any information from any of the  regarding this, when I asked them what power the  has to be contrary in nature to all other rivers. I wished to know this, and asked; also, why no breezes blew from it as from every other river.\n\n\nBut some of the , wishing to be notable for cleverness, put forward three opinions about this river, two of which I would not even mention except just to show what they are.\nOne of them maintains that the  winds are the cause of the river being in flood, because they hinder the  from emptying into the sea. But there are many times when the  winds do not blow, yet the  does the same as before.\nAnd further, if the  winds were the cause, then the other rivers which flow contrary to those winds should be affected like the , and even more so, since being smaller they have a weaker current. Yet there are many rivers in  and many in , and they behave nothing like the .\n\n\nThe second opinion is less grounded on knowledge than the previous, though it is more marvellous to the ear: according to it, the river effects what it does because it flows from Ocean, which flows around the whole world.\n\n\nThe third opinion is by far the most plausible, yet the most erroneous of all. It has no more truth in it than the others. According to this, the  flows from where snows melt; but it flows from  through the midst of , and comes out into .\nHow can it flow from snow, then, seeing that it comes from the hottest places to lands that are for the most part cooler? In fact, for a man who can reason about such things, the principal and strongest evidence that the river is unlikely to flow from snows is that the winds blowing from  and  are hot.\nIn the second place, the country is rainless and frostless; but after snow has fallen, it has to rain within five days ; so that if it snowed, it would rain in these lands. And thirdly, the men of the country are black because of the heat.\nMoreover, kites and swallows live there all year round, and cranes come every year to these places to winter there, flying from the wintry weather of . Now, were there but the least fall of snow in this country through which the  flows and where it rises, none of these things would happen, as necessity proves.\n\n\nThe opinion about Ocean is grounded in obscurity and needs no disproof; for I know of no Ocean river; and I suppose that Homer or some older poet invented this name and brought it into his poetry.\n\n\nIf, after having condemned the opinions proposed, I must indicate what I myself think about these obscure matters, I shall say why I think the  floods in the summer. During the winter, the sun is driven by storms from his customary course and passes over the inland parts of .\nFor the briefest demonstration, everything has been said; for whatever country this god is nearest, or over, it is likely that that land is very thirsty for water and that the local rivers are dried up.\n\n\nA lengthier demonstration goes as follows. In its passage over the inland parts of , the sun does this: as the air is always clear in that region, the land warm, and the winds cool, the sun does in its passage exactly as it would do in the summer passing through the middle of the heaven:\n\nit draws the water to itself, and having done so, expels it away to the inland regions, and the winds catch it and scatter and dissolve it; and, as is to be expected, those that blow from that country, the south and the southwest, are the most rainy of all winds.\nYet I think that the sun never lets go of all of the water that it draws up from the  yearly, but keeps some back near itself. Then, as the winter becomes milder, the sun returns to the middle of the heaven, and after that draws from all rivers alike.\nMeanwhile, the other rivers are swollen to high flood by the quantity of water that falls into them from the sky, because the country is rained on and cut into gullies; but in the summer they are low, lacking the rain and being drawn up too by the sun.\nBut the , being fed by no rain, and being the only river drawn up by the sun in winter, at this time falls far short of the height that it had in summer; which is but natural; for in summer all other waters too and not it alone are attracted to the sun, but in the winter it alone is afflicted.\n\n\nI am convinced, therefore, that the sun is the cause of this phenomenon. The dryness of the air in these parts is also caused by the sun, in my opinion, because it burns its way through it; hence, it is always summer in the inland part of .\nBut were the stations of the seasons changed, so that the south wind and the summer had their station where the north wind and winter are now set, and the north wind was where the south wind is nowif this were so, the sun, when driven from mid-heaven by the winter and the north wind, would pass over the inland parts of  as it now passes over , and I think that in its passage over all  it would have the same effect on the  as it now does on the .\n\n\nAnd as to why no breeze blows from the river, this is my opinion: it is not natural that any breeze blow from very hot places; breezes always come from that which is very cold.\n\n\nLet this be, then, as it is and as it was in the beginning. But as to the sources of the , no one that conversed with me, , , or , professed to know them, except the recorder of the sacred treasures of  in the  city of .\nI thought he was joking when he said that he had exact knowledge, but this was his story. Between the city of  in the  and , there are two hills with sharp peaks, one called  and the other .\nThe springs of the , which are bottomless, rise between these hills; half the water flows north towards , and the other half south towards .\nHe said that  king of  had put to the test whether the springs are bottomless: for he had a rope of many thousand fathoms' length woven and let down into the spring, but he could not reach to the bottom.\nThis recorder, then, if he spoke the truth, showed, I think, that there are strong eddies and an upward flow of water, such that with the stream rushing against the hills the sounding-line when let down cannot reach bottom.\n\n\nI was unable to learn anything from anyone else, but this much further I did learn by the most extensive investigation that I could make, going as far as the city of  to look myself, and beyond that by question and hearsay.\nBeyond , as one travels inland, the land rises. Here one must pass with the boat roped on both sides as men harness an ox; and if the rope breaks, the boat will be carried away by the strength of the current.\nThis part of the river is a four days' journey by boat, and the  here is twisty just as the ; a distance of twelve schoeni must be passed in the foregoing manner. After that, you come to a level plain, where there is an island in the , called .\nThe country above  now begins to be inhabited by : half the people of the island are , and half . Near the island is a great lake, on whose shores live nomadic . After crossing this, you come to the stream of the , which empties into this lake.\nThen you disembark and journey along the river bank for forty days; for there are sharp projecting rocks in the  and many reefs, through which no boat can pass.\nHaving traversed this part in forty days as I have said, you take boat again and so travel for twelve days until you come to a great city called , which is said to be the capital of all .\nThe people of the place worship no other gods but  and ; these they greatly honor, and they have a place of divination sacred to ; they send out armies whenever and wherever this god through his oracle commands them.\n\n\nFrom this city you make a journey by water equal in distance to that by which you came from  to the capital city of , and you come to the land of the . These  are called , which translates, in , as those who stand on the left hand of the king.\nThese once revolted and joined themselves to the , two hundred and forty thousand  of fighting age. The reason was as follows. In the reign of , there were watchposts at  facing , at  of  facing  and , and at  facing .\nAnd still in my time the  hold these posts as they were held in the days of ; there are  guards at  and at . Now the  had been on guard for three years, and no one came to relieve them; so, organizing and making common cause, they revolted from  and went to .\n\n heard of it and pursued them; and when he overtook them, he asked them in a long speech not to desert their children and wives and the gods of their fathers. Then one of them, the story goes, pointed to his genitals and said that wherever that was, they would have wives and children.\nSo they came to , and gave themselves up to the king of the country; who, to make them a gift in return, told them to dispossess certain  with whom he was feuding, and occupy their land. These  then learned  customs and have become milder-mannered by intermixture with the .\n\n\nTo a distance of four months' travel by land and water, then, there is knowledge of the , besides the part of it that is in . So many months, as reckoning shows, are found to be spent by one going from  to the country of the Deserters. The river flows from the west and the sun's setting. Beyond this, no one has clear information to declare; for all that country is desolate because of the heat.\n\n\nBut I heard this from some men of , who told me that they had gone to the oracle of , and conversed there with  king of the , and that from other subjects the conversation turned to the , how no one knows the source of it. Then  told them that once he had been visited by some .\nThese are a  people, inhabiting the country of the  and a little way to the east of the .\nWhen these  were asked on their arrival if they brought any news concerning the  desert, they told  that some sons of their leading men, proud and violent youths, when they came to manhood, besides planning other wild adventures, had chosen by lot five of their company to visit the deserts of  and see whether they could see any farther than those who had seen the farthest.\nIt must be known that the whole northern seacoast of , from  as far as the promontory of , which is the end of , is inhabited throughout its length by , many tribes of them, except the part held by  and ; the region of  that is above the sea and the inhabitants of the coast is infested by wild beasts; and farther inland than the wild-beast country everything is sand, waterless and desolate.\nWhen the young men left their companions, being well supplied with water and provisions, they journeyed first through the inhabited country, and after passing this they came to the region of wild beasts.\nAfter this, they travelled over the desert, towards the west, and crossed a wide sandy region, until after many days they saw trees growing in a plain; when they came to these and were picking the fruit of the trees, they were met by little men of less than common stature, who took them and led them away. The  did not know these men's language nor did the escort know the language of the .\nThe men led them across great marshes, after crossing which they came to a city where all the people were of a stature like that of the guides, and black. A great river ran past this city, from the west towards the rising sun; crocodiles could be seen in it.\n\n\nThis is enough of the story told by  the ; except he said that the  returned, as the men of  told me, and that the people to whose country they came were all wizards;\n\nas to the river that ran past the city,  guessed it to be the ; and reason proves as much. For the  flows from , right through the middle of it; and as I guess, reasoning about things unknown from visible signs, it rises proportionally as far away as does the .\nFor the  flows from the land of the  and the city of  through the very middle of ; now the  live beyond the Pillars of , being neighbors of the , who are the westernmost of all the peoples inhabiting .\nThe , then, flows clean across  and ends its course in the , at , which is inhabited by  colonists.\n\n\nThe , since it flows through inhabited country, is known from many reports; but no one can speak of the source of the ; for , though which it runs, is uninhabited and desert. Regarding its course, I have related everything that I could learn by inquiry; and it issues into . Now  lies about opposite to the mountainous part of ;\n\nfrom there, it is a straight five days' journey for an unencumbered man to  on the ; and  lies opposite the place where the  falls into the sea. Thus I suppose the course of the  in its passage through  to be like the course of the .\n\n\nIt is sufficient to say this much concerning the . But concerning , I am going to speak at length, because it has the most wonders, and everywhere presents works beyond description; therefore, I shall say the more concerning .\n\nJust as the  have a climate peculiar to themselves, and their river is different in its nature from all other rivers, so, too, have they instituted customs and laws contrary for the most part to those of the rest of mankind. Among them, the women buy and sell, the men stay at home and weave; and whereas in weaving all others push the woof upwards, the  push it downwards.\nMen carry burdens on their heads, women on their shoulders. Women pass water standing, men sitting. They ease their bowels indoors, and eat out of doors in the streets, explaining that things unseemly but necessary should be done alone in private, things not unseemly should be done openly.\nNo woman is dedicated to the service of any god or goddess; men are dedicated to all deities male or female. Sons are not compelled against their will to support their parents, but daughters must do so though they be unwilling.\n\n\nEverywhere else, priests of the gods wear their hair long; in , they are shaven. For all other men, the rule in mourning for the dead is that those most nearly concerned have their heads shaven;  are shaven at other times, but after a death they let their hair and beard grow.\nThe  are the only people who keep their animals with them in the house. Whereas all others live on wheat and barley, it is the greatest disgrace for an  to live so; they make food from a coarse grain which some call spelt.\nThey knead dough with their feet, and gather mud and dung with their hands. The  and those who have learned it from them are the only people who practise circumcision. Every man has two garments, every woman only one.\nThe rings and sheets of sails are made fast outside the boat elsewhere, but inside it in . The  write and calculate from left to right; the  do the opposite; yet they say that their way of writing is towards the right, and the  way towards the left. They employ two kinds of writing; one is called sacred, the other demotic.\n\n\nThey are religious beyond measure, more than any other people; and the following are among their customs. They drink from cups of bronze, which they clean out daily; this is done not by some but by all.\nThey are especially careful always to wear newly-washed linen. They practise circumcision for cleanliness' sake; for they would rather be clean than more becoming. Their priests shave the whole body every other day, so that no lice or anything else foul may infest them as they attend upon the gods.\nThe priests wear a single linen garment and sandals of papyrus: they may have no other kind of clothing or footwear. Twice a day and twice every night they wash in cold water. Their religious observances are, one may say, innumerable.\nBut also they receive many benefits: they do not consume or spend anything of their own; sacred food is cooked for them, beef and goose are brought in great abundance to each man every day, and wine of grapes is given to them, too. They may not eat fish.\nThe  sow no beans in their country; if any grow, they will not eat them either raw or cooked; the priests cannot endure even to see them, considering beans an unclean kind of legume. Many (not only one) are dedicated to the service of each god. One of these is the high priest; and when a high priest dies, his son succeeds to his office.\n\n\nThey believe that bulls belong to , and for this reason scrutinize them as follows; if they see even one black hair on them, the bull is considered impure.\nOne of the priests, appointed to the task, examines the beast, making it stand and lie, and drawing out its tongue, to determine whether it is clean of the stated signs which I shall indicate hereafter. He looks also to the hairs of the tail, to see if they grow naturally.\nIf it is clean in all these respects, the priest marks it by wrapping papyrus around the horns, then smears it with sealing-earth and stamps it with his ring; and after this they lead the bull away. But the penalty is death for sacrificing a bull that the priest has not marked. Such is the manner of approving the beast; I will now describe how it is sacrificed.\n\n\nAfter leading the marked beast to the altar where they will sacrifice it, they kindle a fire; then they pour wine on the altar over the victim and call upon the god; then they cut its throat, and having done so sever the head from the body.\nThey flay the carcass of the victim, then invoke many curses on its head, which they carry away. Where there is a market, and  traders in it, the head is taken to the market and sold; where there are no , it is thrown into the river.\nThe imprecation which they utter over the heads is that whatever ill threatens those who sacrifice, or the whole of , fall upon that head.\nIn respect of the heads of sacrificed beasts and the libation of wine, the practice of all  is the same in all sacrifices; and from this ordinance no  will taste of the head of anything that had life.\n\n\nBut in regard to the disembowelling and burning of the victims, there is a different way for each sacrifice. I shall now, however, speak of that goddess whom they consider the greatest, and in whose honor they keep highest festival.\nAfter praying in the foregoing way, they take the whole stomach out of the flayed bull, leaving the entrails and the fat in the carcass, and cut off the legs, the end of the loin, the shoulders, and the neck.\nHaving done this, they fill what remains of the carcass with pure bread, honey, raisins, figs, frankincense, myrrh, and other kinds of incense, and then burn it, pouring a lot of oil on it.\nThey fast before the sacrifice, and while it is burning, they all make lamentation; and when their lamentation is over, they set out a meal of what is left of the victim.\n\n\nAll  sacrifice unblemished bulls and bull-calves; they may not sacrifice cows: these are sacred to .\nFor the images of  are in woman's form, horned like a cow, exactly as the  picture , and cows are held by far the most sacred of all beasts of the herd by all  alike.\nFor this reason, no  man or woman will kiss a  man, or use a knife, or a spit, or a cauldron belonging to a , or taste the flesh of an unblemished bull that has been cut up with a  knife.\nCattle that die are dealt with in the following way. Cows are cast into the river, bulls are buried by each city in its suburbs, with one or both horns uncovered for a sign; then, when the carcass is decomposed, and the time appointed is at hand, a boat comes to each city from the island called ,\n\nan island in the Delta, nine schoeni in circumference. There are many other towns on ; the one from which the boats come to gather the bones of the bulls is called ; a temple of  stands in it of great sanctity.\nFrom this town many go out, some to one town and some to another, to dig up the bones, which they then carry away and all bury in one place. As they bury the cattle, so do they all other beasts at death. Such is their ordinance respecting these also; for they, too, may not be killed.\n\n\nAll that have a temple of  of \n or are of the  district sacrifice goats, but will not touch sheep.\nFor no gods are worshipped by all  in common except  and , who they say is ; these are worshipped by all alike. Those who have a temple of  or are of the  sacrifice sheep, but will not touch goats.\nThe , and those who by the  example will not touch sheep, give the following reason for their ordinance: they say that  wanted very much to see  and that  did not want to be seen by him, but that finally, when  prayed,  contrived\n\nto show himself displaying the head and wearing the fleece of a ram which he had flayed and beheaded. It is from this that the  images of  have a ram's head; and in this, the  are imitated by the , who are colonists from  and  and speak a language compounded of the tongues of both countries.\nIt was from this, I think, that the  got their name, too; for the  call  . The , then, consider rams sacred for this reason, and do not sacrifice them.\nBut one day a year, at the festival of , they cut in pieces and flay a single ram and put the fleece on the image of , as in the story; then they bring an image of  near it. Having done this, all that are at the temple mourn for the ram, and then bury it in a sacred coffin.\n\n\nConcerning , I heard it said that he was one of the twelve gods. But nowhere in  could I hear anything about the other , whom the  know.\nI have indeed a lot of other evidence that the name of  did not come from  to , but from  to  (and in  to those  who gave the name  to the son of ), besides this: that  and , the parents of this , were both  by descent ; and that the  deny knowing the names  and the , nor are these gods reckoned among the gods of .\nYet if they got the name of any deity from the , of these not least but in particular would they preserve a recollection, if indeed they were already making sea voyages and some , too, were seafaring men, as I expect and judge; so that the names of these gods would have been even better known to the  than the name of .\nBut  is a very ancient god in ; as the  themselves say, the change of the eight gods to the twelve, one of whom they acknowledge  to be, was made seventeen thousand years before the reign of .\n\n\nMoreover, wishing to get clear information about this matter where it was possible so to do, I took ship for  in , where I had learned by inquiry that there was a holy temple of .\nThere I saw it, richly equipped with many other offerings, besides two pillars, one of refined gold, one of emerald: a great pillar that shone at night; and in conversation with the priests, I asked how long it was since their temple was built.\nI found that their account did not tally with the belief of the , either; for they said that the temple of the god was founded when  first became a city, and that was two thousand three hundred years ago. At  I saw yet another temple of the so-called .\nThen I went to , too, where I found a temple of  built by the , who made a settlement there when they voyaged in search of ; now they did so as much as five generations before the birth of  the son of  in .\nTherefore, what I have discovered by inquiry plainly shows that  is an ancient god. And furthermore, those , I think, are most in the right, who have established and practise two worships of , sacrificing to one  as to an immortal, and calling him the , but to the other bringing offerings as to a dead hero.\n\n\nAnd the  say many other ill-considered things, too; among them, this is a silly story which they tell about : that when he came to , the  crowned him and led him out in a procession to sacrifice him to ; and for a while (they say) he followed quietly, but when they started in on him at the altar, he resisted and killed them all.\nNow it seems to me that by this story the  show themselves altogether ignorant of the character and customs of the ; for how should they sacrifice men when they are forbidden to sacrifice even beasts, except swine and bulls and bull-calves, if they are unblemished, and geese?\nAnd furthermore, as  was alone, and, still, only a man, as they say, how is it natural that he should kill many myriads? In talking so much about this, may I keep the goodwill of gods and heroes!\n\n\nThis is why the  of whom I have spoken sacrifice no goats, male or female: the  reckon Pan among the eight gods who, they say, were before the twelve gods.\nNow in their painting and sculpture, the image of Pan is made with the head and the legs of a goat, as among the ; not that he is thought to be in fact such, or unlike other gods; but why they represent him so, I have no wish to say.\nThe  consider all goats sacred, the male even more than the female, and goatherds are held in special estimation: one he-goat is most sacred of all; when he dies, it is ordained that there should be great mourning in all the .\nIn the  language  is the name both for the he-goat and for . In my lifetime a strange thing occurred in this district: a he-goat had intercourse openly with a woman. This came to be publicly known.\n\n\nSwine are held by the  to be unclean beasts. In the first place, if an  touches a hog in passing, he goes to the river and dips himself in it, clothed as he is; and in the second place, swineherds, though native born , are alone of all men forbidden to enter any  temple; nor will any give a swineherd his daughter in marriage, nor take a wife from their women; but swineherds intermarry among themselves.\nNor do the  think it right to sacrifice swine to any god except the Moon and ; to these, they sacrifice their swine at the same time, in the same season of full moon; then they eat the meat. The  have an explanation of why they sacrifice swine at this festival, yet abominate them at others; I know it, but it is not fitting that I relate it.\nBut this is how they sacrifice swine to the Moon: the sacrificer lays the end of the tail and the spleen and the caul together and covers them up with all the fat that he finds around the belly, then consigns it all to the fire; as for the rest of the flesh, they eat it at the time of full moon when they sacrifice the victim; but they will not taste it on any other day. Poor men, with but slender means, mold swine out of dough, which they then take and sacrifice.\n\n\nTo , on the evening of his festival, everyone offers a piglet which he kills before his door and then gives to the swineherd who has sold it, for him to take away.\nThe rest of the festival of  is observed by the  much as it is by the , except for the dances; but in place of the phallus, they have invented the use of puppets two feet high moved by strings, the male member nodding and nearly as big as the rest of the body, which are carried about the villages by women; a flute-player goes ahead, the women follow behind singing of .\nWhy the male member is so large and is the only part of the body that moves, there is a sacred legend that explains.\n\n\nNow then, it seems to me that  son of  was not ignorant of but was familiar with this sacrifice. For  was the one who taught the  the name of  and the way of sacrificing to him and the phallic procession; he did not exactly unveil the subject taking all its details into consideration, for the teachers who came after him made a fuller revelation; but it was from him that the  learned to bear the phallus along in honor of , and they got their present practice from his teaching.\nI say, then, that  acquired the prophetic art, being a discerning man, and that, besides many other things which he learned from , he also taught the  things concerning , altering few of them; for I will not say that what is done in  in connection with the god and what is done among the  originated independently: for they would then be of an  character and not recently introduced.\nNor again will I say that the  took either this or any other custom from the . But I believe that  learned the worship of  chiefly from  of  and those who came with  from  to the land now called .\n\n\nIn fact, the names of nearly all the gods came to  from . For I am convinced by inquiry that they have come from foreign parts, and I believe that they came chiefly from .\nExcept the names of  and the , as I have already said, and , and , and , and the Graces, and the , the names of all the gods have always existed in . I only say what the  themselves say. The gods whose names they say they do not know were, as I think, named by the , except , the knowledge of whom they learned from the .\nAlone of all nations the  have had among them the name of  from the beginning, and they have always honored this god. The , however, are not accustomed to pay any honors to heroes.\n\n\nThese customs, then, and others besides, which I shall indicate, were taken by the  from the . It was not so with the ithyphallic images of ; the production of these came from the , from whom the  were the first  to take it, and then handed it on to others.\nFor the  were then already counted as  when the  came to live in the land with them and thereby began to be considered as . Whoever has been initiated into the rites of the , which the  learned from the  and now practice, understands what my meaning is.\n\n was formerly inhabited by those  who came to live among the , and it is from them that the  take their rites.\nThe , then, were the first  to make ithyphallic images of , and they did this because the  taught them. The  told a certain sacred tale about this, which is set forth in the  mysteries.\n\n\nFormerly, in all their sacrifices, the  called upon gods without giving name or appellation to any (I know this, because I was told at ); for as yet they had not heard of such. They called them gods from the fact that, besides setting everything in order, they maintained all the dispositions.\nThen, after a long while, first they learned the names of the rest of the gods, which came to them from , and, much later, the name of ; and presently they asked the oracle at  about the names; for this place of divination, held to be the most ancient in , was at that time the only one.\nWhen the , then, asked at  whether they should adopt the names that had come from foreign parts, the oracle told them to use the names. From that time onwards they used the names of the gods in their sacrifices; and the  received these later from the .\n\n\nBut whence each of the gods came to be, or whether all had always been, and how they appeared in form, they did not know until yesterday or the day before, so to speak;\n\nfor I suppose  and Homer flourished not more than four hundred years earlier than I; and these are the ones who taught the  the descent of the gods, and gave the gods their names, and determined their spheres and functions, and described their outward forms.\nBut the poets who are said to have been earlier than these men were, in my opinion, later. The earlier part of all this is what the priestesses of  tell; the later, that which concerns  and Homer, is what I myself say.\n\n\nBut about the oracles in , and that one which is in , the  give the following account. The priests of  of \n told me that two priestesses had been carried away from \n by ; one, they said they had heard was taken away and sold in , the other in ; these women, they said, were the first founders of places of divination in the aforesaid countries.\nWhen I asked them how it was that they could speak with such certain knowledge, they said in reply that their people had sought diligently for these women, and had never been able to find them, but had learned later the story which they were telling me.\n\n\nThat, then, I heard from the  priests; and what follows, the prophetesses of  say: that two black doves had come flying from \n in , one to  and one to ;\n\nthe latter settled on an oak tree, and there uttered human speech, declaring that a place of divination from  must be made there; the people of  understood that the message was divine, and therefore established the oracular shrine.\nThe dove which came to  told the  (they say) to make an oracle of ; this also is sacred to . Such was the story told by the  priestesses, the eldest of whom was  and the next  and the youngest ; and the rest of the servants of the temple at  similarly held it true.\n\n\nBut my own belief about it is this. If the  did in fact carry away the sacred women and sell one in  and one in , then, in my opinion, the place where this woman was sold in what is now , but was formerly called , was ;\n\nand then, being a slave there, she established a shrine of  under an oak that was growing there; for it was reasonable that, as she had been a handmaid of the temple of  at \n, she would remember that temple in the land to which she had come.\nAfter this, as soon as she understood the  language, she taught divination; and she said that her sister had been sold in  by the same  who sold her.\n\n\nI expect that these women were called doves by the people of  because they spoke a strange language, and the people thought it like the cries of birds;\n\nthen the woman spoke what they could understand, and that is why they say that the dove uttered human speech; as long as she spoke in a foreign tongue, they thought her voice was like the voice of a bird. For how could a dove utter the speech of men? The tale that the dove was black signifies that the woman was .\n\nThe fashions of divination at \n of  and at  are like one another; moreover, the practice of divining from the sacrificed victim has also come from .\n\nIt would seem, too, that the  were the first people to establish solemn assemblies, and processions, and services; the  learned all that from them. I consider this proved, because the  ceremonies are manifestly very ancient, and the  are of recent origin.\n\n\nThe  hold solemn assemblies not once a year, but often. The principal one of these and the most enthusiastically celebrated is that in honor of  at the town of  , and the next is that in honor of  at .\nThis town is in the middle of the , and there is in it a very great temple of , who is  in the  language.\nThe third greatest festival is at  in honor of ; the fourth is the festival of the sun at , the fifth of  at , and the sixth of  at .\n\n\nWhen the people are on their way to , they go by river, a great number in every boat, men and women together. Some of the women make a noise with rattles, others play flutes all the way, while the rest of the women, and the men, sing and clap their hands.\nAs they travel by river to , whenever they come near any other town they bring their boat near the bank; then some of the women do as I have said, while some shout mockery of the women of the town; others dance, and others stand up and lift their skirts. They do this whenever they come alongside any riverside town.\nBut when they have reached , they make a festival with great sacrifices, and more wine is drunk at this feast than in the whole year besides. It is customary for men and women (but not children) to assemble there to the number of seven hundred thousand, as the people of the place say.\n\n\nThis is what they do there; I have already described how they keep the feast of  at . There, after the sacrifice, all the men and women lament, in countless numbers; but it is not pious for me to say who it is for whom they lament.\n\n who live in  do even more than this, inasmuch as they cut their foreheads with knives; and by this they show that they are foreigners and not .\n\n\nWhen they assemble at  on the night of the sacrifice, they keep lamps burning outside around their houses. These lamps are saucers full of salt and oil on which the wick floats, and they burn all night. This is called the Feast of Lamps.\n\n who do not come to this are mindful on the night of sacrifice to keep their own lamps burning, and so they are alight not only at  but throughout . A sacred tale is told showing why this night is lit up thus and honored.\n\n\nWhen the people go to  and , they offer sacrifice only. At  sacrifice is offered and rites performed just as elsewhere; but when the sun is setting, a few of the priests hover about the image, while most of them go and stand in the entrance to the temple with clubs of wood in their hands; others, more than a thousand men fulfilling vows, who also carry wooden clubs, stand in a mass opposite.\nThe image of the god, in a little gilded wooden shrine, they carry away on the day before this to another sacred building. The few who are left with the image draw a four-wheeled wagon conveying the shrine and the image that is in the shrine; the others stand in the space before the doors and do not let them enter, while the vow-keepers, taking the side of the god, strike them, who defend themselves.\nA fierce fight with clubs breaks out there, and they are hit on their heads, and many, I expect, even die from their wounds; although the  said that nobody dies.\nThe natives say that they made this assembly a custom from the following incident: the mother of  lived in this temple;  had been raised apart from her and came, when he grew up, wishing to visit his mother; but as her attendants kept him out and would not let him pass, never having seen him before,  brought men from another town, manhandled the attendants, and went in to his mother. From this, they say, this hitting for  became a custom in the festival.\n\n\nFurthermore, it was the  who first made it a matter of religious observance not to have intercourse with women in temples or to enter a temple after such intercourse without washing. Nearly all other peoples are less careful in this matter than are the  and , and consider a man to be like any other animal;\n\nfor beasts and birds (they say) are seen to mate both in the temples and in the sacred precincts; now were this displeasing to the god, the beasts would not do so. This is the reason given by others for practices which I, for my part, dislike;\n\n\nbut the  in this and in all other matters are exceedingly strict against desecration of their temples.\n\nAlthough  has  on its borders, it is not a country of many animals. All of them are held sacred; some of these are part of men's households and some not; but if I were to say why they are left alone as sacred, I should end up talking of matters of divinity, which I am especially averse to treating; I have never touched upon such except where necessity has compelled me.\nBut I will indicate how it is customary to deal with the animals. Men and women are appointed guardians to provide nourishment for each kind respectively; a son inherits this office from his father.\nTownsfolk in each place, when they pay their vows, pray to the god to whom the animal is dedicated, shaving all or one half or one third of their children's heads, and weighing the hair in a balance against a sum of silver; then the weight in silver of the hair is given to the female guardian of the creatures, who buys fish with it and feeds them.\nThus, food is provided for them. Whoever kills one of these creatures intentionally is punished with death; if he kills accidentally, he pays whatever penalty the priests appoint. Whoever kills an ibis or a hawk, intentionally or not, must die for it.\n\n\nThere are many household animals; and there would be many more, were it not for what happens among the cats. When the females have a litter, they are no longer receptive to the males; those that seek to have intercourse with them cannot;\n\nso their recourse is to steal and carry off and kill the kittens (but they do not eat what they have killed). The mothers, deprived of their young and desiring to have more, will then approach the males; for they are creatures that love offspring.\nAnd when a fire breaks out, very strange things happen among the cats. The  stand around in a broken line, thinking more of the cats than of quenching the burning; but the cats slip through or leap over the men and spring into the fire.\nWhen this happens, there is great mourning in . The occupants of a house where a cat has died a natural death shave their eyebrows and no more; where a dog has died, the head and the whole body are shaven.\n\n\nDead cats are taken away to sacred buildings in the town of , where they are embalmed and buried; female dogs are buried by the townsfolk in their own towns in sacred coffins; and the like is done with mongooses. Shrewmice and hawks are taken away to , ibises to the city of .\nThere are few bears, and the wolves are little bigger than foxes; both these are buried wherever they are found lying.\n\n\nThe nature of crocodiles is as follows. For the four winter months, it eats nothing. It has four feet, and lives both on land and in the water, for it lays eggs and hatches them out on land and spends the greater part of the day on dry ground, and the night in the river, the water being warmer than the air and dew.\nNo mortal creature of all which we know grows from so small a beginning to such greatness; for its eggs are not much bigger than goose eggs, and the young crocodile is of a proportional size, but it grows to a length of twenty-eight feet and more.\nIt has eyes like pigs' eyes, and long, protruding teeth. It is the only animal that has no tongue. It does not move the lower jaw, but brings the upper jaw down upon the lower, uniquely among beasts.\nIt also has strong claws, and a scaly, impenetrable hide on its back. It is blind in the water, but very keen of sight in the air. Since it lives in the water, its mouth is all full of leeches. All birds and beasts flee from it, except the sandpiper , with which it is at peace because this bird does the crocodile a service;\n\nfor whenever the crocodile comes ashore out of the water and then opens its mouth (and it does this mostly to catch the west wind), the sandpiper goes into its mouth and eats the leeches; the crocodile is pleased by this service and does the sandpiper no harm.\n\n\nSome of the  consider crocodiles sacred; others do not, but treat them as enemies. Those who live near \n and  consider them very sacred.\nEvery household raises one crocodile, trained to be tame; they put ornaments of glass and gold on its ears and bracelets on its forefeet, provide special food and offerings for it, and give the creatures the best of treatment while they live; after death, the crocodiles are embalmed and buried in sacred coffins.\nBut around  they are not held sacred, and are even eaten. The  do not call them crocodiles, but khampsae. The  named them crocodiles, from their resemblance to the lizards which they have in their walls.\n\n\nThere are many different ways of crocodile hunting; I will write of the way that I think most worth mentioning. The hunter baits a hook with a hog's back, and lets it float into the midst of the river; he himself stays on the bank with a young live pig, which he beats.\nHearing the squeals of the pig, the crocodile goes after the sound, and meets the bait, which it swallows; then the hunters pull the line. When the crocodile is drawn ashore, first of all the hunter smears its eyes over with mud; when this is done, the quarry is very easily masteredno light matter, without that.\n\n\nHippopotamuses are sacred in the district of , but not elsewhere in . They present the following appearance: four-footed, with cloven hooves like cattle; blunt-nosed; with a horse's mane, visible tusks, a horse's tail and voice; big as the biggest bull. Their hide is so thick that, when it is dried, spearshafts are made of it.\n\n\nOtters are found in the river, too, which the  consider sacred; and they consider sacred that fish, too, which is called the scale-fish, and the eel. These, and the fox-goose among birds, are said to be sacred to the god of the .\n\n\nThere is another sacred bird, too, whose name is phoenix. I myself have never seen it, only pictures of it; for the bird seldom comes into : once in five hundred years, as the people of  say.\nIt is said that the phoenix comes when his father dies. If the picture truly shows his size and appearance, his plumage is partly golden and partly red. He is most like an eagle in shape and size.\nWhat they say this bird manages to do is incredible to me. Flying from  to the temple of the sun, they say, he conveys his father encased in myrrh and buries him at the temple of the Sun.\nThis is how he conveys him: he first molds an egg of myrrh as heavy as he can carry, then tries lifting it, and when he has tried it, he then hollows out the egg and puts his father into it, and plasters over with more myrrh the hollow of the egg into which he has put his father, which is the same in weight with his father lying in it, and he conveys him encased to the temple of the Sun in . This is what they say this bird does.\n\n\nNear \n there are sacred snakes, harmless to men, small in size, and bearing two horns on the top of their heads. These, when they die, are buried in the temple of , to whom they are said to be sacred.\n\n\nThere is a place in  not far from the town of  where I went to learn about the winged serpents. When I arrived there, I saw innumerable bones and backbones of serpents: many heaps of backbones, great and small and even smaller.\nThis place, where the backbones lay scattered, is where a narrow mountain pass opens into a great plain, which adjoins the plain of .\nWinged serpents are said to fly from  at the beginning of spring, making for ; but the ibis birds encounter the invaders in this pass and kill them.\nThe  say that the ibis is greatly honored by the  for this service, and the  give the same reason for honoring these birds.\n\n\nNow this is the appearance of the ibis. It is all quite black, with the legs of a crane, and a beak sharply hooked, and is as big as a landrail. Such is the appearance of the ibis which fights with the serpents. Those that most associate with men (for there are two kinds of ibis )\n\nhave the whole head and neck bare of feathers; their plumage is white, except the head and neck and wingtips and tail (these being quite black); the legs and beak of the bird are like those of the other ibis. The serpents are like water-snakes.\nTheir wings are not feathered but very like the wings of a bat.I have now said enough concerning creatures that are sacred.\n\n\nAmong the  themselves, those who live in the cultivated country are the most assiduous of all men at preserving the memory of the past, and none whom I have questioned are so skilled in history.\nThey practice the following way of life. For three consecutive days in every month they purge themselves, pursuing health by means of emetics and drenches; for they think that it is from the food they eat that all sicknesses come to men.\nEven without this, the  are the healthiest of all men, next to the ; the explanation of which, in my opinion, is that the climate in all seasons is the same: for change is the great cause of men's falling sick, more especially changes of seasons.\nThey eat bread, making loaves which they call cyllestis, of coarse grain. For wine, they use a drink made from barley, for they have no vines in their country. They eat fish either raw and sun-dried, or preserved with brine.\nQuails and ducks and small birds are salted and eaten raw; all other kinds of birds, as well as fish (except those that the  consider sacred) are eaten roasted or boiled.\n\n\nAfter rich men's repasts, a man carries around an image in a coffin, painted and carved in exact imitation of a corpse two or four feet long. This he shows to each of the company, saying While you drink and enjoy, look on this; for to this state you must come when you die. Such is the custom at their symposia.\n\n\nThey keep the customs of their fathers, adding none to them. Among other notable customs of theirs is this, that they have one song, the Linus-song, which is sung in  and  and elsewhere; each nation has a name of its own for this,\n\nbut it happens to be the same song that the  sing, and call ; so that of many things in  that amaze me, one is: where did the  get ? Plainly they have always sung this song; but in Egyptian  is called .\nThe  told me that  was the only son of their first king, who died prematurely, and this dirge was sung by the  in his honor; and this, they said, was their earliest and their only chant.\n\n\nThere is a custom, too, which no  except the  have in common with the : younger men, encountering their elders, yield the way and stand aside, and rise from their seats for them when they approach.\nBut they are like none of the  in this: passers-by do not address each other, but salute by lowering the hand to the knee.\n\n\nThey wear linen tunics with fringes hanging about the legs, called calasiris, and loose white woolen mantles over these. But nothing woolen is brought into temples, or buried with them: that is impious.\nThey agree in this with practices called Orphic and Bacchic, but in fact  and Pythagorean: for it is impious, too, for one partaking of these rites to be buried in woolen wrappings. There is a sacred legend about this.\n\n\nOther things originating with the  are these. Each month and day belong to one of the gods, and according to the day of one's birth are determined how one will fare and how one will end and what one will be like; those  occupied with poetry exploit this.\nMore portents have been discovered by them than by all other peoples; when a portent occurs, they take note of the outcome and write it down; and if something of a like kind happens again, they think it will have a like result.\n\n\nAs to the art of divination among them, it belongs to no man, but to some of the gods; there are in their country oracles of , , , , , and , and of  (the most honored of all) in the town of . Nevertheless, they have several ways of divination, not just one.\n\n\nThe practice of medicine is so specialized among them that each physician is a healer of one disease and no more. All the country is full of physicians, some of the eye, some of the teeth, some of what pertains to the belly, and some of internal diseases.\n\n\nThey mourn and bury the dead like this: whenever a man of note is lost to his house by death, all the women of the house daub their faces or heads with mud; then they leave the corpse in the house and roam about the city lamenting, with their garments girt around them and their breasts showing, and with them all the women of their relatives;\n\nelsewhere, the men lament, with garments girt likewise. When this is done, they take the dead body to be embalmed.\n\n\nThere are men whose sole business this is and who have this special craft.\nWhen a dead body is brought to them, they show those who brought it wooden models of corpses, painted likenesses; the most perfect way of embalming belongs, they say, to One whose name it would be impious for me to mention in treating such a matter; the second way, which they show, is less perfect than the first, and cheaper; and the third is the least costly of all. Having shown these, they ask those who brought the body in which way they desire to have it prepared.\nHaving agreed on a price, the bearers go away, and the workmen, left alone in their place, embalm the body. If they do this in the most perfect way, they first draw out part of the brain through the nostrils with an iron hook, and inject certain drugs into the rest.\nThen, making a cut near the flank with a sharp knife of  stone, they take out all the intestines, and clean the belly, rinsing it with palm wine and bruised spices;\n\nthey sew it up again after filling the belly with pure ground myrrh and casia and any other spices, except frankincense. After doing this, they conceal the body for seventy days, embalmed in saltpetre; no longer time is allowed for the embalming;\n\nand when the seventy days have passed, they wash the body and wrap the whole of it in bandages of fine linen cloth, anointed with gum, which the  mostly use instead of glue;\n\nthen they give the dead man back to his friends. These make a hollow wooden figure like a man, in which they enclose the corpse, shut it up, and keep it safe in a coffin-chamber, placed erect against a wall.\n\n\nThat is how they prepare the dead in the most costly way; those who want the middle way and shun the costly, they prepare as follows.\nThe embalmers charge their syringes with cedar oil and fill the belly of the dead man with it, without making a cut or removing the intestines, but injecting the fluid through the anus and preventing it from running out; then they embalm the body for the appointed days; on the last day they drain the belly of the cedar oil which they put in before.\nIt has such great power as to bring out with it the internal organs and intestines all dissolved; meanwhile, the flesh is eaten away by the saltpetre, and in the end nothing is left of the body but hide and bones. Then the embalmers give back the dead body with no more ado.\n\n\nThe third manner of embalming, the preparation of the poorer dead, is this: they cleanse the belly with a purge, embalm the body for the seventy days and then give it back to be taken away.\n\n\nWives of notable men, and women of great beauty and reputation, are not at once given to the embalmers, but only after they have been dead for three or four days;\n\nthis is done to deter the embalmers from having intercourse with the women. For it is said that one was caught having intercourse with the fresh corpse of a woman, and was denounced by his fellow-workman.\n\n\nAnyone,  or foreigner, known to have been carried off by a crocodile or drowned by the river itself, must by all means be embalmed and wrapped as attractively as possible and buried in a sacred coffin by the people of the place where he is cast ashore;\n\nnone of his relatives or friends may touch him, but his body is considered something more than human, and is handled and buried by the priests of the  themselves.\n\n\nThe  shun using  customs, and (generally speaking) the customs of all other peoples as well. Yet, though the rest are wary of this, there is a great city called , in the  district, near the .\nIn this city is a square temple of  son of , in a grove of palm trees. Before this temple stand great stone columns; and at the entrance, two great stone statues. In the outer court there is a shrine with an image of  standing in it.\nThe people of this  say that  is seen often up and down this land, and often within the temple, and that the sandal he wears, which is four feet long, keeps turning up, and that when it does turn up, all  prospers.\nThis is what they say; and their doings in honor of  are , inasmuch as they celebrate games that include every form of contest, and offer animals and cloaks and skins as prizes.\nWhen I asked why  appeared only to them, and why, unlike all other , they celebrate games, they told me that  was by lineage of their city; for  and , who travelled to , were of ; and they traced descent from these down to .\nThey told how he came to , too, when he came to  for the reason alleged by the  as wellnamely, to bring the 's head from and recognized all his relatives; and how he had heard the name of  from his mother before he came to . It was at his bidding, they said, that they celebrated the games.\n\n\nAll these are the customs of  who live above the marsh country. Those who inhabit the marshes have the same customs as the rest of , even that each man has one wife just like . They have, besides, devised means to make their food less costly.\nWhen the river is in flood and flows over the plains, many lilies, which the  call lotus, grow in the water. They gather these and dry them in the sun; then they crush the poppy-like center of the plant and bake loaves of it.\nThe root of this lotus is edible also, and of a sweetish taste; it is round, and the size of an apple.\nOther lilies grow in the river, too, that are like roses; the fruit of these is found in a calyx springing from the root by a separate stalk, and is most like a comb made by wasps; this produces many edible seeds as big as olive pits, which are eaten both fresh and dried.\nThey also use the byblus which grows annually: it is gathered from the marshes, the top of it cut off and put to other uses, and the lower part, about twenty inches long, eaten or sold. Those who wish to use the byblus at its very best, roast it before eating in a red-hot oven. Some live on fish alone. They catch the fish, take out the intestines, then dry them in the sun and eat them dried.\n\n\nFish that go in schools are seldom born in rivers; they are raised in the lakes, and this is how they behave: when the desire of spawning comes on them, they swim out to sea in schools, the males leading, and throwing out their milt, while the females come after and swallow and conceive from it.\nWhen the females have grown heavy in the sea, then all the fish swim back to their own haunts. But the same no longer lead; now the leadership goes to the females. They go before in a school as the males had, and now and then throw off some of their eggs (which are like millet-seeds), which the males devour as they follow. These millet-seeds, or eggs, are fish.\nThe fish that are reared come from the eggs that survive and are not devoured. Those fish that are caught while swimming seawards show bruises on the left side of their heads; those that are caught returning, on the right side.\nThis happens because they keep close to the left bank as they swim seawards, and keep to the same bank also on their return, grazing it and keeping in contact with it as well as they can, I suppose lest the current make them miss their way.\nWhen the  begins to rise, hollow and marshy places near the river are the first to begin to fill, the water trickling through from the river, and as soon as they are flooded, they are suddenly full of little fishes.\nWhere these probably come from, I believe that I can guess. When the  falls, the fish have dropped their eggs into the mud before they leave with the last of the water; and when in the course of time the flood comes again in the following year, from these eggs at once come the fish.\n\n\nSo much, then, for the fish. The  who live around the marshes use an oil drawn from the castor-berry, which they call kiki. They sow this plant, which grows wild in , on the banks of the rivers and lakes;\n\nsown in , it produces abundant fruit, though malodorous; when they gather this, some bruise and press it, others boil after roasting it, and collect the liquid that comes from it. This is thick and useful as oil for lamps, and gives off a strong smell.\n\n\nAgainst the mosquitos that abound, the following have been devised by them: those who dwell higher up than the marshy country are well served by the towers where they ascend to sleep, for the winds prevent the mosquitos from flying aloft;\n\nthose living about the marshes have a different recourse, instead of the towers. Every one of them has a net, with which he catches fish by day, and at night he sets it around the bed where he rests, then creeps under it and sleeps.\nIf he sleeps wrapped in a garment or cloth, the mosquitos bite through it; but through the net they absolutely do not even venture.\n\n\nThe boats in which they carry cargo are made of the acacia, which is most like the lotus of  in form, and its sap is gum. Of this tree they cut logs of four feet long and lay them like courses of bricks, and build the boat\n\nby fastening these four foot logs to long and close-set stakes; and having done so, they set crossbeams athwart and on the logs. They use no ribs. They caulk the seams within with byblus.\nThere is one rudder, passing through a hole in the boat's keel. The mast is of acacia-wood and the sails of byblus. These boats cannot move upstream unless a brisk breeze continues; they are towed from the bank; but downstream they are managed thus:\n\nthey have a raft made of tamarisk wood, fastened together with matting of reeds, and a pierced stone of about two talents' weight; the raft is let go to float down ahead of the boat, connected to it by a rope, and the stone is connected by a rope to the after part of the boat.\nSo, driven by the current, the raft floats swiftly and tows the baris (which is the name of these boats,) and the stone dragging behind on the river bottom keeps the boat's course straight. There are many of these boats; some are of many thousand talents' burden.\n\n\nWhen the  overflows the land, only the towns are seen high and dry above the water, very like the islands in the . These alone stand out, the rest of  being a sheet of water. So when this happens, folk are not ferried, as usual, in the course of the stream, but clean over the plain.\nIndeed, the boat going up from  to  passes close by the pyramids themselves, though the course does not go by here, but by the Delta's point and the town ; but your voyage from the sea and  to  will take you over the plain near the town of  and that which is called ' town.\n\n\n is a town of some reputation, and is especially assigned to the consort of the reigning king of , to provide her shoes. This has been done since  has been under  dominion.\nThe other town, I think, is named after  son of  the , and son-in-law of ; for it is called ' town. It may be that there was another ; but the name is not .\n\n\nSo far, all I have said is the record of my own autopsy and judgment and inquiry. Henceforth I will record  chronicles, according to what I have heard, adding something of what I myself have seen.\nThe priests told me that  was the first king of , and that first he separated  from the  by a dam. All the river had flowed close under the sandy mountains on the  side, but  made the southern bend of it, which begins about twelve and one half miles above , by damming the stream, thereby drying up the ancient channel, and carried the river by a channel so that it flowed midway between the hills.\nAnd to this day the  keep careful watch on this bend of the river, strengthening its dam every year to keep the current in; for were the  to burst its dikes and overflow here, all  would be in danger of flooding.\nThen, when this first king  had made dry land of what he thus cut off, he first founded in it that city which is now called  (for even  lies in the narrow part of ), and outside of it he dug a lake from the river to its north and west (for the  itself bounds it on the east); and secondly, he built in it the great and most noteworthy temple of .\n\n\nAfter him came three hundred and thirty kings, whose names the priests recited from a papyrus roll. In all these many generations there were eighteen  kings, and one queen, native to the country; the rest were all  men.\nThe name of the queen was the same as that of the  princess, . She, to avenge her brother (he was king of  and was slain by his subjects, who then gave  the sovereignty) put many of the  to death by treachery.\nShe built a spacious underground chamber; then, with the pretence of inaugurating it, but with quite another intent in her mind, she gave a great feast, inviting to it those  whom she knew to have had the most complicity in her brother's murder; and while they feasted, she let the river in upon them by a vast secret channel.\nThis was all that the priests told of her, except that when she had done this she cast herself into a chamber full of hot ashes, to escape vengeance.\n\n\nBut of the other kings they related no achievement or act of great note, except of , the last of them.\nThis  was remembered as having built the northern forecourt of the temple of , and dug a lake, of as great a circumference as I shall later indicate; and built pyramids there also, the size of which I will mention when I speak of the lake. All this was ' work, they said; of none of the rest had they anything to record.\n\n\nLeaving the latter aside, then, I shall speak of the king who came after them, whose name was .\nThis king, the priests said, set out with a fleet of long ships from the  and subjugated all those living by the , until he came to a sea which was too shallow for his vessels.\nAfter returning from there back to , he gathered a great army (according to the account of the priests) and marched over the mainland, subjugating every nation to which he came.\nWhen those that he met were valiant men and strove hard for freedom, he set up pillars in their land, the inscription on which showed his own name and his country's, and how he had overcome them with his own power;\n\nbut when the cities had made no resistance and been easily taken, then he put an inscription on the pillars just as he had done where the nations were brave; but he also drew on them the private parts of a woman, wishing to show clearly that the people were cowardly.\n\n\nHe marched over the country doing this until he had crossed over from  to  and defeated the  and . Thus far and no farther, I think, the  army went; for the pillars can be seen standing in their country, but in none beyond it.\nFrom there, he turned around and went back home; and when he came to the , that King, , may have detached some part of his army and left it there to live in the country (for I cannot speak with exact knowledge), or it may be that some of his soldiers grew weary of his wanderings, and stayed by the .\n\n\nFor it is plain to see that the  are ; and what I say, I myself noted before I heard it from others. When it occurred to me, I inquired of both peoples; and the  remembered the  better than the  remembered the ;\n\nthe  said that they considered the  part of ' army. I myself guessed it, partly because they are dark-skinned and woolly-haired; though that indeed counts for nothing, since other peoples are, too; but my better proof was that the  and  and  are the only nations that have from the first practised circumcision.\nThe  and the  of  acknowledge that they learned the custom from the , and the  of the valleys of the  and the , as well as their neighbors the , say that they learned it lately from the . These are the only nations that circumcise, and it is seen that they do just as the .\nBut as to the  and  themselves, I cannot say which nation learned it from the other; for it is evidently a very ancient custom. That the others learned it through traffic with , I consider clearly proved by this: that  who traffic with  cease to imitate the  in this matter and do not circumcise their children.\n\n\nListen to something else about the , in which they are like the : they and the  alone work linen and have the same way of working it, a way peculiar to themselves; and they are alike in all their way of life, and in their speech. Linen has two names: the  kind is called by the  ; that which comes from  is called .\n\n\nAs to the pillars that , king of , set up in the countries, most of them are no longer to be seen. But I myself saw them in the  district of , with the aforesaid writing and the women's private parts on them.\nAlso, there are in  two figures of this man carved in rock, one on the road from  to , and the other on that from  to .\nIn both places, the figure is over twenty feet high, with a spear in his right hand and a bow in his left, and the rest of his equipment proportional; for it is both  and ;\n\nand right across the breast from one shoulder to the other a text is cut in the  sacred characters, saying: I myself won this land with the strength of my shoulders. There is nothing here to show who he is and whence he comes, but it is shown elsewhere.\nSome of those who have seen these figures guess they are , but they are far indeed from the truth.\n\n\nNow when this   (so the priests said) reached  of  on his way home, leading many captives from the peoples whose lands he had subjugated, his brother, whom he had left in charge in , invited him and his sons to a banquet and then piled wood around the house and set it on fire.\nWhen  was aware of this, he at once consulted his wife, whom (it was said) he had with him; and she advised him to lay two of his six sons on the fire and make a bridge over the burning so that they could walk over the bodies of the two and escape. This  did; two of his sons were thus burnt but the rest escaped alive with their father.\n\n\nAfter returning to , and avenging himself on his brother,  found work for the multitude which he brought with him from the countries which he had subdued.\nIt was these who dragged the great and long blocks of stone which were brought in this king's reign to the temple of ; and it was they who were compelled to dig all the canals which are now in , and involuntarily made what had been a land of horses and carts empty of these.\nFor from this time , although a level land, could use no horses or carts, because there were so many canals going every which way. The reason why the king thus intersected the country was this:\n\nthose  whose towns were not on the , but inland from it, lacked water whenever the flood left their land, and drank only brackish water from wells.\n\n\nFor this reason  was intersected. This king also (they said) divided the country among all the  by giving each an equal parcel of land, and made this his source of revenue, assessing the payment of a yearly tax.\nAnd any man who was robbed by the river of part of his land could come to  and declare what had happened; then the king would send men to look into it and calculate the part by which the land was diminished, so that thereafter it should pay in proportion to the tax originally imposed.\nFrom this, in my opinion, the  learned the art of measuring land; the sunclock and the sundial, and the twelve divisions of the day, came to  from  and not from .\n\n\n was the only  king who also ruled . To commemorate his name, he set before the temple of  two stone statues, of himself and of his wife, each fifty feet high, and statues of his four sons, each thirty-three feet.\nLong afterwards,  the  would have set up his statue before these; but the priest of  forbade him, saying that he had achieved nothing equal to the deeds of  the ; for  (he said) had subjugated the , besides as many nations as  had conquered, and  had not been able to overcome the ;\n\ntherefore, it was not just that  should set his statue before the statues of , whose achievements he had not equalled. , it is said, let the priest have his way.\n\n\nWhen  died, he was succeeded in the kingship (the priests said) by his son . This king waged no wars, and chanced to become blind, for the following reason: the  came down in such a flood as there had never been, rising to a height of thirty feet, and the water that flowed over the fields was roughened by a strong wind;\n\nthen, it is said, the king was so audacious as to seize a spear and hurl it into the midst of the river eddies. Right after this, he came down with a disease of the eyes, and became blind. When he had been blind for ten years, an oracle from the city of  declared to him that the term of his punishment was drawing to an end, and that he would regain his sight by washing his eyes with the urine of a woman who had never had intercourse with any man but her own husband.\n\n tried his own wife first; and, as he remained blind, all women, one after another. When he at last recovered his sight, he took all the women whom he had tried, except the one who had made him see again, and gathered them into one town, the one which is now called ; having concentrated them together there, he burnt them and the town;\n\nbut the woman by whose means he had recovered his sight, he married. Most worthy of mention among the many offerings which he dedicated in all the noteworthy temples for his deliverance from blindness are the two marvellous stone obelisks which he set up in the temple of the Sun. Each of these is made of a single block, and is over one hundred and sixty-six feet high and thirteen feet thick.\n\n\n was succeeded (they said) by a man of , whose name in the  tongue was . This  has a very attractive and well-appointed temple precinct at , south of the temple of .\nAround the precinct live  of , and the whole place is called the Camp of the . There is in the precinct of  a temple called the temple of the Stranger ; I guess this is a temple of , daughter of , partly because I have heard the story of 's abiding with , and partly because it bears the name of the Foreign : for no other of 's temples is called by that name.\n\n\nWhen I inquired of the priests, they told me that this was the story of . After carrying off  from ,  sailed away for his own country; violent winds caught him in the  and drove him into the ; and from there (as the wind did not let up) he came to , to the mouth of the  called the , and to the Salters'.\nNow there was (and still is) on the coast a temple of ; if a servant of any man takes refuge there and is branded with certain sacred marks, delivering himself to the god, he may not be touched. This law continues today the same as it has always been from the first.\nHearing of the temple law, some of ' servants ran away from him, threw themselves on the mercy of the god, and brought an accusation against  meaning to injure him, telling the whole story of  and the wrong done . They laid this accusation before the priests and the warden of the  mouth, whose name was .\n\n\nWhen  heard it, he sent this message the quickest way to  at :\n\nA stranger has come, a , who has committed an impiety in . After defrauding his guest-friend, he has come bringing the man's wife and a very great deal of wealth, driven to your country by the wind. Are we to let him sail away untouched, or are we to take away what he has come with?\n\n sent back this message: Whoever this is who has acted impiously against his guest-friend, seize him and bring him to me, that I may know what he will say.\n\n\nHearing this,  seized  and detained his ships there, and then brought him with  and all the wealth, and the suppliants too, to .\nWhen all had arrived,  asked  who he was and whence he sailed;  told him his lineage and the name of his country, and about his voyage, whence he sailed.\nThen  asked him where he had got ; when  was evasive in his story and did not tell the truth, the men who had taken refuge with the temple confuted him, and related the whole story of the wrong.\nFinally,  declared the following judgment to them, saying, If I did not make it a point never to kill a stranger who has been caught by the wind and driven to my coasts, I would have punished you on behalf of the , you most vile man. You committed the gravest impiety after you had had your guest-friend's hospitality: you had your guest-friend's wife.\nAnd as if this were not enough, you got her to fly with you and went off with her. And not just with her, either, but you plundered your guest-friend's wealth and brought it, too.\nNow, then, since I make it a point not to kill strangers, I shall not let you take away this woman and the wealth, but I shall watch them for the  stranger, until he come and take them away; but as for you and your sailors, I warn you to leave my country for another within three days, and if you do not, I will declare war on you.\n\n\nThis, the priests said, was how  came to . And, in my opinion, Homer knew this story, too; but seeing that it was not so well suited to epic poetry as the tale of which he made use, he rejected it, showing that he knew it.\nThis is apparent from the passage in the  (and nowhere else does he return to the story) where he relates the wanderings of , and shows how he and  were carried off course, and wandered to, among other places,  in .\nThis is in the story of the Prowess of , where the verses run as follows:\n\n\nHe mentions it in the  also: \n\nand again  says to :\n\nIn these verses the poet shows that he knew of 's wanderings to ; for  borders on , and the , to whom  belongs, dwell in .\n\n\nThese verses and this passage prove most clearly that the  poems are not the work of Homer but of someone else. For the  poems relate that  reached  with  in three days from , having a fair wind and a smooth sea; but according to the , he wandered from his course in bringing her.\n\n\nEnough, then, of Homer and the  poems. But, when I asked the priests whether the  account of what happened at  were idle or not, they gave me the following answer, saying that they had inquired and knew from  himself.\nAfter the rape of , a great force of  came to the  land on ' behalf. After disembarking and disposing their forces, they sent messengers to , one of whom was  himself.\nWhen these were let inside the city walls, they demanded the restitution of  and of the property which  had stolen from  and carried off, and they demanded reparation for the wrongs; but the  gave the same testimony then and later, sworn and unsworn: that they did not have  or the property claimed, but all of that was in , and they could not justly make reparation for what  the  had.\nBut the , thinking that the  were mocking them, laid siege to the city, until they took it; but there was no  there when they breached the wall, but they heard the same account as before; so, crediting the original testimony, they sent  himself to .\n\n\n then went to  and up the river to ; there, relating the truth of the matter, he met with great hospitality and got back , who had not been harmed, and also all his wealth, besides.\nYet, although getting this,  was guilty of injustice toward the . For adverse weather detained him when he tried to sail away; after this continued for some time, he carried out something impious,\n\ntaking two native children and sacrificing them. When it became known that he had done this, he fled with his ships straight to , hated and hunted; and where he went from there, the  could not say. The priests told me that they had learned some of this by inquiry, but that they were sure of what had happened in their own country.\n\n\nThe ' priests said this, and I myself believe their story about , for I reason thus: had  been in , then with or without the will of  she would have been given back to the .\nFor surely  was not so mad, or those nearest to him, as to consent to risk their own persons and their children and their city so that  might cohabit with .\nEven if it were conceded that they were so inclined in the first days, yet when not only many of the  were slain in fighting against the , but  himself lost to death two or three or even more of his sons in every battle (if the poets are to be believed), in this turn of events, had  been 's own wife, I cannot but think that he would have restored her to the , if by so doing he could escape from the evils besetting him.\n\n was not even heir to the throne, in which case matters might have been in his hands since  was old, but , who was an older and a better man than , was going to receive the royal power at 's death, and ought not have acquiesced in his brother's wrongdoing, especially when that brother was the cause of great calamity to  himself and all the rest of the .\nBut since they did not have  there to give back, and since the  would not believe them although they spoke the truthI am convinced and declarethe divine powers provided that the , perishing in utter destruction, should make this clear to all mankind: that retribution from the gods for terrible wrongdoing is also terrible. This is what I think, and I state it.\n\n\nThe next to reign after  (they said) was . The memorial of his name left by him was the western forecourt of the temple of ; he set two statues here forty-one feet high; the northernmost of these the  call Summer, and the southernmost Winter; the one that they call Summer they worship and treat well, but do the opposite to the statue called Winter.\n\nThis king (they told me) had great wealth in silver, so great that none of the succeeding kings could surpass or come near it. To store his treasure safely, he had a stone chamber built, one of its walls abutting on the outer side of his palace. But the builder of it shrewdly provided that one stone be so placed as to be easily removed by two men or even by one.\nSo when the chamber was finished, the king stored his treasure in it, and as time went on, the builder, drawing near the end of his life, summoned his sons (he had two) and told them how he had provided for them, that they have an ample livelihood, by the art with which he had built the king's treasure-house; explaining clearly to them how to remove the stone, he gave the coordinates of it, and told them that if they kept these in mind, they would be the custodians of the king's riches.\nSo when he was dead, his sons got to work at once: coming to the palace by night, they readily found and managed the stone in the building, and took away much of the treasure.\n\nWhen the king opened the building, he was amazed to see the containers lacking their treasure; yet he did not know whom to accuse, seeing that the seals were unbroken and the building shut fast. But when less treasure appeared the second and third times he opened the building (for the thieves did not stop plundering), he had traps made and placed around the containers in which his riches were stored.\nThe thieves came just as before, and one of them crept in; when he came near the container, right away he was caught in the trap. When he saw the trouble he was in, he called to his brother right away and explained to him the problem, and told him to come in quickly and cut off his head, lest he be seen and recognized and destroy him, too. He seemed to have spoken rightly to the other, who did as he was persuaded and then, replacing the stone, went home, carrying his brother's head.\n\nWhen day came, the king went to the building, and was amazed to see in the trap the thief's body without a head, yet the building intact, with no way in or out. At a loss, he did as follows: he suspended the thief's body from the wall and set guards over it, instructing them to seize and bring to him any whom they saw weeping or making lamentation.\n\nBut the thief's mother, when the body had been hung up, was terribly stricken: she had words with her surviving son, and told him that he was somehow to think of some way to cut loose and bring her his brother's body, and if he did not obey, she threatened to go to the king and denounce him as having the treasure.\n\nSo when his mother bitterly reproached the surviving son and for all that he said he could not dissuade her, he devised a plan: he harnessed asses and put skins full of wine on the asses, then set out driving them; and when he was near those who were guarding the hanging body, he pulled at the feet of two or three of the skins and loosed their fastenings;\n\nand as the wine ran out, he beat his head and cried aloud like one who did not know to which ass he should turn first, while the guards, when they saw the wine flowing freely, ran out into the road with cups and caught what was pouring out, thinking themselves in luck;\n\nfeigning anger, the man cursed all; but as the guards addressed him peaceably, he pretended to be soothed and to relent in his anger, and finally drove his asses out of the road and put his harness in order.\nAnd after more words passed and one joked with him and got him to laugh, he gave them one of the skins: and they lay down there just as they were, disposed to drink, and included him and told him to stay and drink with them; and he consented and stayed.\nWhen they cheerily saluted him in their drinking, he gave them yet another of the skins; and the guards grew very drunk with the abundance of liquor, and lay down right there where they were drinking, overpowered by sleep;\n\nbut he, when it was late at night, cut down the body of his brother and shaved the right cheek of each of the guards for the indignity, and loading the body on his asses, drove home, fulfilling his mother's commands.\n\n\nWhen the king learned that the body of the thief had been taken, he was beside himself and, obsessed with finding who it was who had managed this, did as followsthey say, but I do not believe it.\nHe put his own daughter in a brothel, instructing her to accept all alike and, before having intercourse, to make each tell her the shrewdest and most impious thing he had done in his life; whoever told her the story of the thief, she was to seize and not let get out.\nThe girl did as her father told her, and the thief, learning why she was doing this, did as follows, wanting to get the better of the king by craft.\nHe cut the arm off a fresh corpse at the shoulder, and went to the king's daughter, carrying it under his cloak, and when asked the same question as the rest, he said that his most impious act had been when he had cut the head off his brother who was caught in a trap in the king's treasury; and his shrewdest, that after making the guards drunk he had cut down his brother's hanging body.\nWhen she heard this, the princess grabbed for him; but in the darkness the thief let her have the arm of the corpse; and clutching it, she held on, believing that she had the arm of the other; but the thief, after giving it to her, was gone in a flash out the door.\n\n\nWhen this also came to the king's ears, he was astonished at the man's ingenuity and daring, and in the end, he sent a proclamation to every town, promising the thief immunity and a great reward if he would come into the king's presence.\nThe thief trusted the king and came before him;  was very admiring and gave him his daughter to marry on the grounds that he was the cleverest of men; for as the  (he said) surpassed all others in craft, so he surpassed the .\n\n\nThey said that later this king went down alive to what the  call  and there played dice with , and after winning some and losing some, came back with a gift from her of a golden hand towel.\nFrom the descent of , when he came back, they said that the  celebrate a festival, which I know that they celebrate to this day, but whether this is why they celebrate, I cannot say.\nOn the day of the festival, the priests weave a cloth and bind it as a headband on the eyes of one of their number, whom they then lead, wearing the cloth, into a road that goes to the temple of ; they themselves go back, but this priest with his eyes bandaged is guided (they say) by two wolves to 's temple, a distance of three miles from the city, and led back again from the temple by the wolves to the same place.\n\n\nThese  stories are for the benefit of whoever believes such tales: my rule in this history is that I record what is said by all as I have heard it. The  say that  and  are the rulers of the lower world.\nThe  were the first who maintained the following doctrine, too, that the human soul is immortal, and at the death of the body enters into some other living thing then coming to birth; and after passing through all creatures of land, sea, and air, it enters once more into a human body at birth, a cycle which it completes in three thousand years.\nThere are  who have used this doctrine, some earlier and some later, as if it were their own; I know their names, but do not record them.\n\n\nThey said that  until the time of  was altogether well-governed and prospered greatly, but that , who was the next king, brought the people to utter misery. For first he closed all the temples, so that no one could sacrifice there; and next, he compelled all the  to work for him.\nTo some, he assigned the task of dragging stones from the quarries in the  to the ; and after the stones were ferried across the river in boats, he organized others to receive and drag them to the mountains called .\nThey worked in gangs of a hundred thousand men, each gang for three months. For ten years the people wore themselves out building the road over which the stones were dragged, work which was in my opinion not much lighter at all than the building of the pyramid\n\n(for the road is nearly a mile long and twenty yards wide, and elevated at its highest to a height of sixteen yards, and it is all of stone polished and carved with figures). The aforesaid ten years went to the building of this road and of the underground chambers in the hill where the pyramids stand; these, the king meant to be burial-places for himself, and surrounded them with water, bringing in a channel from the .\nThe pyramid itself was twenty years in the making. Its base is square, each side eight hundred feet long, and its height is the same; the whole is of stone polished and most exactly fitted; there is no block of less than thirty feet in length.\n\n\nThis pyramid was made like stairs, which some call steps and others, tiers.\nWhen this, its first form, was completed, the workmen used short wooden logs as levers to raise the rest of the stones ; they heaved up the blocks from the ground onto the first tier of steps;\n\nwhen the stone had been raised, it was set on another lever that stood on the first tier, and the lever again used to lift it from this tier to the next.\nIt may be that there was a new lever on each tier of steps, or perhaps there was only one lever, quite portable, which they carried up to each tier in turn; I leave this uncertain, as both possibilities were mentioned.\nBut this is certain, that the upper part of the pyramid was finished off first, then the next below it, and last of all the base and the lowest part.\nThere are writings on the pyramid in  characters indicating how much was spent on radishes and onions and garlic for the workmen; and I am sure that, when he read me the writing, the interpreter said that sixteen hundred talents of silver had been paid.\nNow if that is so, how much must have been spent on the iron with which they worked, and the workmen's food and clothing, considering that the time aforesaid was spent in building, while hewing and carrying the stone and digging out the underground parts was, as I suppose, a business of long duration.\n\n\nAnd so evil a man was  that, needing money, he put his own daughter in a brothel and made her charge a fee (how much, they did not say). She did as her father told her, but was disposed to leave a memorial of her own, and asked of each coming to her that he give one stone;\n\nand of these stones they said the pyramid was built that stands midmost of the three, over against the great pyramid; each side of it measures one hundred and fifty feet.\n\n\nThe  said that this  reigned for fifty years; at his death he was succeeded by his brother , who was in all respects like .  also built a pyramid, smaller than his brother's. I have measured it myself.\nIt has no underground chambers, nor is it entered like the other by a canal from the , but the river comes in through a built passage and encircles an island, in which, they say,  himself lies.\nThis pyramid was built on the same scale as the other, except that it falls forty feet short of it in height; it stands near the great pyramid; the lowest layer of it is of variegated  stone. Both of them stand on the same ridge, which is about a hundred feet high. , they said, reigned for fifty-six years.\n\n\nThus, they reckon that for a hundred and six years  was in great misery and the temples so long shut were never opened. The people hate the memory of these two kings so much that they do not much wish to name them, and call the pyramids after the shepherd , who then pastured his flocks in this place.\n\n\nThe next king of , they said, was ' son . Disliking his father's doings, he opened the temples and let the people, ground down to the depth of misery, go to their business and their sacrifices; and he was the most just judge among all the kings.\nThis is why he is praised above all the rulers of ; for not only were his judgments just, but  would give any who were not satisfied with the judgment a present out of his own estate to compensate him for his loss.\nThough mild toward his people and conducting himself as he did, yet he suffered calamities, the first of which was the death of his daughter, the only child of his household. Deeply grieved over this misfortune, he wanted to give her a burial somewhat more sumptuous than ordinary; he therefore made a hollow cow's image of gilded wood and placed the body of his dead daughter therein.\n\n\nThis cow was not buried in the earth but was to be seen even in my time, in the town of , where it stood in a furnished room of the palace; incense of all kinds is offered daily before it, and a lamp burns by it all through every night.\nNear this cow in another chamber statues of ' concubines stand, so the priests of  said; and in fact there are about twenty colossal wooden figures there, made like naked women; but except what I was told, I cannot tell who these are.\n\n\nBut some tell the following story about the cow and the statues: that  conceived a passion for his own daughter and then had intercourse with her against her will;\n\nand they say that afterwards the girl strangled herself for grief, and that he buried her in this cow, but that her mother cut off the hands of the attendants who had betrayed the daughter to her father, and that now their statues are in the same condition as the living women were.\nBut this I believe to be a silly story, especially about the hands of the figures. For in fact we ourselves saw that the hands have fallen off through age, and were lying at their feet even in my day.\n\n\nAs for the cow, it is covered with a purple robe, only the head and neck exposed, encrusted with a very thick layer of gold. Between the horns is the golden figure of the sun's orb.\nIt does not stand, but kneels; it is as big as a live cow of great size. This image is carried out of the chamber once every year, whenever the  mourn the god whose name I omit in speaking of these matters:\n\nthen the cow is brought out into the light; for they say that before she died she asked her father, , that she see the sun once a year.\n\n\nAfter what happened to his daughter, the following happened next to this king: an oracle came to him from the city of , announcing that he had just six years to live and was to die in the seventh.\nThe king took this badly, and sent back to the oracle a message of reproach, blaming the god that his father and his uncle, though they had shut up the temples, and disregarded the gods, and destroyed men, had lived for a long time, but that he who was pious was going to die so soon.\nBut a second oracle came announcing that for this very reason his life was hastening to a close: he had done what was contrary to fate;  should have been afflicted for a hundred and fifty years, and the two kings before him knew this, but not he.\nHearing this,  knew that his doom was fixed. Therefore, he had many lamps made, and would light these at nightfall and drink and enjoy himself, not letting up day or night, roaming to the marsh country and the groves and wherever he heard of the likeliest places of pleasure.\nThis was his recourse, so that by turning night into day he might make his six years into twelve and so prove the oracle false.\n\n\nThis king, too, left a pyramid, but far smaller than his father's, each side twenty feet short of three hundred feet long, square at the base, and as much as half its height of  stone. Some  say that it was built by , the courtesan, but they are wrong;\n\nindeed, it is clear to me that they say this without even knowing who  was (otherwise, they would never have credited her with the building of a pyramid on which what I may call an uncountable sum of money was spent), or that  flourished in the reign of , not of ;\n\nfor very many years later than these kings who left the pyramids came , who was  by birth, and a slave of  son of  the , and a fellow-slave of  the story-writer. For he was owned by , too, as the following made crystal clear:\n\nwhen the , obeying an oracle, issued many proclamations summoning anyone who wanted it to accept compensation for the killing of , no one accepted it except the son of 's son, another ; hence , too, was 's.\n\n\n came to  to work, brought by  of , but upon her arrival was freed for a lot of money by  of , son of  and brother of  the poetess.\nThus  lived as a free woman in , where, as she was very alluring, she acquired a lot of moneysufficient for such a , so to speak, but not for such a pyramid.\nSeeing that to this day anyone who likes can calculate what one tenth of her worth was, she cannot be credited with great wealth. For  desired to leave a memorial of herself in , by having something made which no one else had thought of or dedicated in a temple and presenting this at  to preserve her memory;\n\nso she spent one tenth of her substance on the manufacture of a great number of iron beef spits, as many as the tenth would pay for, and sent them to ; these lie in a heap to this day, behind the altar set up by the  and in front of the shrine itself.\nThe courtesans of  seem to be peculiarly alluring, for the woman of whom this story is told became so famous that every  knew the name of , and later on a certain  was the theme of song throughout , although less celebrated than the other.\n\n, after giving  her freedom, returned to . He is bitterly attacked by  in one of her poems. This is enough about .\n\n\nAfter , the priests said,  became king of . He built the eastern outer court of ' temple; this is by far the finest and grandest of all the courts, for while all have carved figures and innumerable felicities of architecture, this court has far more than any.\nAs not much money was in circulation during this king's reign, they told me, a law was made for the  allowing a man to borrow on the security of his father's corpse; and the law also provided that the lender become master of the entire burial-vault of the borrower, and that the penalty for one giving this security, should he fail to repay the loan, was that he was not to be buried at his death either in that tomb of his fathers or in any other, nor was he to bury any relative of his there.\nFurthermore, in his desire to excel all who ruled  before him, this king left a pyramid of brick to commemorate his name, on which is this writing, cut on a stone:\n\nDo not think me less than pyramids of stone; for I excel them as much as  does other gods; for they stuck a pole down into a marsh and collected what mud clung to the pole, made bricks of it, and thus built me. These were the acts of .\n\n\nAfter him reigned a blind man called , of the town of that name. In his reign  was invaded by  king of  and a great army of .\nThe blind man fled to the marshes, and the  ruled  for fifty years, during which he distinguished himself for the following:\n\nhe would never put to death any  wrongdoer but sentenced all, according to the severity of their offenses, to raise embankments in their native towns. Thus the towns came to stand yet higher than before;\n\nfor after first being built on embankments made by the excavators of the canals in the reign of , they were yet further raised in the reign of the .\nOf the towns in  that were raised, in my opinion,  is especially prominent, where there is also a temple of , a building most worthy of note. Other temples are greater and more costly, but none more pleasing to the eye than this.  is, in the  language, .\n\n\nHer temple is of this description: except for the entrance, it stands on an island; for two channels approach it from the  without mixing with one another, running as far as the entryway of the temple, the one and the other flowing around it, each a hundred feet wide and shaded by trees.\nThe outer court is sixty feet high, adorned with notable figures ten feet high. The whole circumference of the city commands a view down into the temple in its midst; for the city's level has been raised, but that of the temple has been left as it was from the first, so that it can be seen into from above.\nA stone wall, cut with figures, runs around it; within is a grove of very tall trees growing around a great shrine where the image of the goddess is; the temple is a square, each side measuring an eighth of a mile.\nA road, paved with stone, about three eighths of a mile long leads to the entrance, running eastward through the marketplace, towards the temple of ; this road is about four hundred feet wide, and bordered by trees reaching to heaven. Such is this temple.\n\n\nNow the departure of the  (they said) came about in this way. After seeing in a dream one who stood over him and urged him to gather together all the Priests in  and cut them in half, he fled from the country.\nSeeing this vision, he said, he supposed it to be a manifestation sent to him by the gods, so that he might commit sacrilege and so be punished by gods or men; he would not (he said) do so, but otherwise, for the time foretold for his rule over  was now fulfilled, after which he was to depart:\n\nfor when he was still in , the oracles that are consulted by the people of that country told him that he was fated to reign fifty years over . Seeing that this time was now completed and that he was troubled by what he saw in his dream,  departed from  of his own volition.\n\n\nWhen the  left , the blind man (it is said) was king once more, returning from the marshes where he had lived for fifty years on an island that he built of ashes and earth; for the  who were to bring him food without the 's knowledge were instructed by the king to bring ashes whenever they came, to add to their gift.\nThis island was never discovered before the time of ; all the kings before him sought it in vain for more than seven hundred years. The name of it is , and it is over a mile long and of an equal breadth.\n\n\nThe next king was the priest of  whose name was . He despised and had no regard for the warrior , thinking he would never need them; besides otherwise dishonoring them, he took away the chosen lands which had been given to them, twelve fields to each man, in the reign of former kings.\nSo when presently king  came against , with a great force of  and , the warrior  would not march against him.\nThe priest, in this quandary, went into the temple shrine and there before the god's image bitterly lamented over what he expected to suffer. Sleep came on him while he was lamenting, and it seemed to him the god stood over him and told him to take heart, that he would come to no harm encountering the power of : I shall send you champions, said the god.\nSo he trusted the vision, and together with those  who would follow him camped at , where the road comes into ; and none of the warriors would go with him, but only merchants and craftsmen and traders.\nTheir enemies came there, too, and during the night were overrun by a horde of field mice that gnawed quivers and bows and the handles of shields, with the result that many were killed fleeing unarmed the next day.\nAnd to this day a stone statue of the  king stands in ' temple, with a mouse in his hand, and an inscription to this effect: Look at me, and believe.\n\n\nThus far went the record given by the  and their priests; and they showed me that the time from the first king to that priest of , who was the last, covered three hundred and forty-one generations, and that in this time this also had been the number of their kings, and of their high priests.\nNow three hundred generations are ten thousand years, three generations being equal to a hundred. And over and above the three hundred, the remaining forty-one cover thirteen hundred and forty years.\nThus the whole period is eleven thousand three hundred and forty years; in all of which time (they said) they had had no king who was a god in human form, nor had there been any such either before or after those years among the rest of the kings of .\nFour times in this period (so they told me) the sun rose contrary to experience; twice he came up where he now goes down, and twice went down where he now comes up; yet  at these times underwent no change, either in the produce of the river and the land, or in the matter of sickness and death.\n\n\n the historian was once at \n, where he made a genealogy for himself that had him descended from a god in the sixteenth generation. But the priests of  did with him as they also did with me (who had not traced my own lineage).\nThey brought me into the great inner court of the temple and showed me wooden figures there which they counted to the total they had already given, for every high priest sets up a statue of himself there during his lifetime;\n\npointing to these and counting, the priests showed me that each succeeded his father; they went through the whole line of figures, back to the earliest from that of the man who had most recently died.\nThus, when  had traced his descent and claimed that his sixteenth forefather was a god, the priests too traced a line of descent according to the method of their counting; for they would not be persuaded by him that a man could be descended from a god; they traced descent through the whole line of three hundred and forty-five figures, not connecting it with any ancestral god or hero, but declaring each figure to be a Piromis the son of a Piromis; in , one who is in all respects a good man.\n\n\nThus they showed that all those whose statues stood there had been good men, but quite unlike gods.\nBefore these men, they said, the rulers of  were gods, but none had been contemporary with the human priests. Of these gods one or another had in succession been supreme; the last of them to rule the country was ' son , whom the  call ; he deposed , and was the last divine king of .  is, in the  language, .\n\n\nAmong the , , , and Pan are held to be the youngest of the gods. But in , Pan is the most ancient of these and is one of the eight gods who are said to be the earliest of all;  belongs to the second dynasty (that of the so-called twelve gods); and  to the third, which came after the twelve.\nHow many years there were between  and the reign of , I have already shown; Pan is said to be earlier still; the years between  and  are the fewest, and they are reckoned by the  at fifteen thousand.\nThe  claim to be sure of all this, since they have reckoned the years and chronicled them in writing.\nNow the  who was called the son of , daughter of , was about sixteen hundred years before my time, and  son of  about nine hundred years; and Pan the son of  (for according to the   and  were the parents of Pan) was about eight hundred years before me, and thus of a later date than the  war.\n\n\nWith regard to these two, Pan and , one may follow whatever story one thinks most credible; but I give my own opinion concerning them here. Had  son of  and Pan son of  appeared in  and lived there to old age, like  the son of , it might have been said that they too (like ) were but men, named after the older Pan and , the gods of antiquity;\n\nbut as it is, the  story has it that no sooner was  born than  sewed him up in his thigh and carried him away to  in  beyond ; and as for Pan, the  do not know what became of him after his birth. It is therefore plain to me that the  learned the names of these two gods later than the names of all the others, and trace the birth of both to the time when they gained the knowledge.\n\n\nSo far I have recorded what the  themselves say. I shall now relate what is recorded alike by  and foreigners, and shall add something of what I myself have seen.\n\nAfter the reign of the priest of  the  were made free. But they could never live without a king, so they divided  into twelve districts and set up twelve kings.\nThese kings intermarried, and agreed to be close friends, no one deposing another or seeking to possess more than another.\nThe reason for this agreement, which they scrupulously kept, was this: no sooner were they established in their districts than an oracle was given them that whichever of them poured a libation from a bronze vessel in the temple of  (where, as in all the temples, they used to assemble) would be king of all .\n\n\nMoreover, they decided to preserve the memory of their names by a common memorial, and so they made a labyrinth a little way beyond  and near the place called the . I have seen it myself, and indeed words cannot describe it;\n\nif one were to collect the walls and evidence of other efforts of the , the sum would not amount to the labor and cost of this labyrinth. And yet the temple at  and the one on  are noteworthy.\nThough the pyramids beggar description and each one of them is a match for many great monuments built by , this maze surpasses even the pyramids.\nIt has twelve roofed courts with doors facing each other: six face north and six south, in two continuous lines, all within one outer wall. There are also double sets of chambers, three thousand altogether, fifteen hundred above and the same number under ground.\nWe ourselves viewed those that are above ground, and speak of what we have seen, but we learned through conversation about the underground chambers;\nthe  caretakers would by no means show them, as they were, they said, the burial vaults of the kings who first built this labyrinth, and of the sacred crocodiles.\nThus we can only speak from hearsay of the lower chambers; the upper we saw for ourselves, and they are creations greater than human. The exits of the chambers and the mazy passages hither and thither through the courts were an unending marvel to us as we passed from court to apartment and from apartment to colonnade, from colonnades again to more chambers and then into yet more courts.\nOver all this is a roof, made of stone like the walls, and the walls are covered with cut figures, and every court is set around with pillars of white stone very precisely fitted together. Near the corner where the labyrinth ends stands a pyramid two hundred and forty feet high, on which great figures are cut. A passage to this has been made underground.\n\n\nSuch is this labyrinth; and still more marvellous is , on which it stands. This lake has a circumference of four hundred and fifty miles, or sixty schoeni: as much as the whole seaboard of . Its length is from north to south; the deepest part has a depth of fifty fathoms.\nThat it has been dug out and made by men's hands the lake shows for itself; for almost in the middle of it stand two pyramids, so built that fifty fathoms of each are below and fifty above the water; atop each is a colossal stone figure seated on a throne.\nThus these pyramids are a hundred fathoms high; and a hundred fathoms equal a furlong of six hundred feet, the fathom measuring six feet or four cubits, the foot four spans and the cubit six spans.\nThe water of the lake is not natural (for the country here is exceedingly arid) but brought by a channel from the ; six months it flows into the lake, and six back into the river.\nFor the six months that it flows out of the lake, the daily take of fish brings a silver talent into the royal treasury, and twenty minae for each day of the flow into the lake.\n\n\nFurthermore, the natives said that this lake drains underground into the , and extends under the mountains that are above , having the inland country on its west.\nWhen I could not see anywhere the earth taken from the digging of this lake, since this was curious to me, I asked those who live nearest the lake where the stuff was that had been dug out. They told me where it had been carried, and I readily believed them, for I had heard of a similar thing happening in the  city of .\n\n king of  had great wealth, which he kept in an underground treasury. Some thieves plotted to carry it off; they surveyed their course and dug an underground way from their own house to the palace, carrying the earth taken out of the passage dug by night to the , which runs past , until at last they accomplished their end.\nThis, I was told, had happened when the  was dug, except that the work went on not by night but by day. The  bore the earth dug out by them to the , to be caught and scattered (as was to be expected) by the river. Thus is this lake said to have been dug.\n\n\nNow the twelve kings were just, and in time came to sacrifice in ' temple. On the last day of the feast, as they were about to pour libations, the high priest brought out the golden vessels which they commonly used for this; but he counted wrongly and had only eleven for the twelve.\nSo the last in line, , as he had no vessel, took off his bronze helmet and held it out and poured the libation with it. All the kings were accustomed to wear helmets, and were then helmeted;\n\nit was not in guile, then, that  held out his headgear; but the rest perceived what  had done, and remembered the oracle that promised the sovereignty of all  to whoever poured a libation from a vessel of bronze; therefore, though they considered  not deserving of death (for they examined him and found that he had acted without intent), they decided to strip him of most of his power and to chase him away into the marshes, and that he was not to concern himself with the rest of .\n\n\nThis  had formerly been in exile in , where he had fled from  the , who killed his father ; then, when the  departed because of what he saw in a dream, the  of the district of  brought him back from .\n\n was king for the second time when he found himself driven away into the marshes by the eleven kings because of the helmet.\nBelieving, therefore, that he had been abused by them, he meant to be avenged on those who had expelled him. He sent to inquire in the town of , where the most infallible oracle in  is; the oracle answered that he would have vengeance when he saw men of bronze coming from the sea.\n\n did not in the least believe that men of bronze would come to aid him. But after a short time,  and , voyaging for plunder, were forced to put in on the coast of , where they disembarked in their armor of bronze; and an  came into the marsh country and brought news to  (for he had never before seen armored men) that men of bronze had come from the sea and were foraging in the plain.\n\n saw in this the fulfillment of the oracle; he made friends with the  and , and promised them great rewards if they would join him and, having won them over, deposed the eleven kings with these allies and those  who volunteered.\n\n\nHaving made himself master of all , he made the southern outer court of ' temple at , and built facing this a court for , where  is kept and fed whenever he appears; this court has an inner colonnade all around it and many cut figures; the roof is held up by great statues twenty feet high for pillars.  in  is .\n\n\nTo the  and  who had helped him,  gave places to live in called , opposite each other on either side of the ; and besides this, he paid them all that he had promised.\nMoreover, he put  boys in their hands to be taught , and from these, who learned the language, are descended the present-day  interpreters.\nThe  and  lived for a long time in these places, which are near the sea, on the arm of the  called the , a little way below the town of . Long afterwards, king  removed them and settled them at  to be his guard against the .\nIt is a result of our communication with these settlers in  (the first of foreign speech to settle in that country) that we  have exact knowledge of the history of  from the reign of  onwards.\nThere still remained in my day, in the places out of which the  and  were turned, the winches for their ships and the ruins of their houses. This is how  got .\n\n\nI have often mentioned the  oracle, and shall give an account of this, as it deserves. This oracle is sacred to , and is situated in a great city by the  of the , on the way up from the sea.\n\n is the name of the city where this oracle is; I have already mentioned it. In  there is a temple of  and . The shrine of  where the oracle is, is itself very great, and its outer court is sixty feet high.\nBut what caused me the most wonder among the things apparent there I shall mention. In this precinct is the shrine of , the height and length of whose walls is all made of a single stone slab; each wall has an equal length and height; namely, seventy feet. Another slab makes the surface of the roof, the cornice of which is seven feet broad.\n\n\nThus, then, the shrine is the most marvellous of all the things that I saw in this temple; but of things of second rank, the most wondrous is the island called .\nThis lies in a deep and wide lake near the temple at , and the  say that it floats. I never saw it float, or move at all, and I thought it a marvellous tale, that an island should truly float.\nHowever that may be, there is a great shrine of  on it, and three altars stand there; many palm trees grow on the island, and other trees too, some yielding fruit and some not.\nThis is the story that the  tell to explain why the island moves: that on this island that did not move before, , one of the eight gods who first came to be, who was living at  where this oracle of hers is, taking charge of  from , hid him for safety in this island which is now said to float, when  came hunting through the world, keen to find the son of .\n\n and  were (they say) children of  and , and  was made their nurse and preserver; in ,  is ,  ,  .\nIt was from this legend and no other that  son of  took a notion which is in no poet before him: that  was the daughter of . For this reason the island was made to float. So they say.\n\n\n ruled  for fifty-three years, twenty-nine of which he spent before , a great city in , besieging it until he took it.  held out against a siege longer than any city of which we know.\n\n\n had a son, , who became king of . It was he who began building the canal into the , which was finished by  the . This is four days' voyage in length, and it was dug wide enough for two triremes to move in it rowed abreast.\nIt is fed by the , and is carried from a little above  by the  town of ; it issues into the . Digging began in the part of the  plain nearest to ; the mountains that extend to  (the mountains where the stone quarries are) come close to this plain;\n\nthe canal is led along the foothills of these mountains in a long reach from west to east; passing then into a ravine, it bears southward out of the hill country towards the .\nNow the shortest and most direct passage from the northern to the southern or  is from the  promontory, the boundary between  and , to the , and this is a distance of one hundred and twenty five miles, neither more nor less;\n\nthis is the most direct route, but the canal is far longer, inasmuch as it is more crooked. In ' reign, a hundred and twenty thousand  died digging it.  stopped work, stayed by a prophetic utterance that he was toiling beforehand for the barbarian. The  call all men of other languages barbarians.\n\n\n, then, stopped work on the canal and engaged in preparations for war; some of his ships of war were built on the northern sea, and some in the , by the  coast: the winches for landing these can still be seen.\nHe used these ships when needed, and with his land army met and defeated the  at , taking the great  city of  after the battle.\nHe sent to  of  and dedicated there to  the garments in which he won these victories. Then he died after a reign of sixteen years, and his son  reigned in his place.\n\n\nWhile this  was king of , he was visited by ambassadors from , the  boasting that they had arranged the  games with all the justice and fairness in the world, and claiming that even the , although the wisest of all men, could not do better.\nWhen the  came to  and announced why they had come,  assembled the  reputed to be wisest. These assembled and learned all that the  were to do regarding the games; after explaining this, the  said that they had come to learn whether the  could discover any juster way.\nThe  deliberated, and then asked the  if their own citizens took part in the contests. The  answered that they did: all  from  or elsewhere might contend.\nThen the  said that in establishing this rule they fell short of complete fairness: For there is no way that you will not favor your own townsfolk in the contest and wrong the stranger; if you wish in fact to make just rules and have come to  for that reason, you should admit only strangers to the contest, and not . Such was the counsel of the  to the .\n\n\n reigned over  for only six years; he invaded , and immediately thereafter died, and  the son of  reigned in his place.\nHe was more fortunate than any former king (except his great-grandfather ) during his rule of twenty-five years, during which he sent an army against  and fought at sea with the king of .\nBut when it was fated that evil should overtake him, the cause of it was something that I will now deal with briefly, and at greater length in the  part of this history.\n\n sent a great force against  and suffered a great defeat. The  blamed him for this and rebelled against him; for they thought that  had knowingly sent his men to their doom, so that after their perishing in this way he might be the more secure in his rule over the rest of the . Bitterly angered by this, those who returned home and the friends of the slain openly revolted.\n\n\nHearing of this,  sent  to dissuade them. When  came up with the , he exhorted them to desist; but as he spoke an  came behind him and put a helmet on his head, saying it was the token of royalty.\nAnd  showed that this was not displeasing to him, for after being made king by the rebel  he prepared to march against .\nWhen  heard of it, he sent against  an esteemed  named , one of his own court, instructing him to take the rebel alive and bring him into his presence. When  came and summoned ,  (who was on horseback) rose up and farted, telling the messenger to take that back to .\nBut when in spite of this  insisted that  obey the king's summons and go to him,  answered that he had long been preparing to do just that, and  would find him above reproach, for he would present himself, and bring others.\nHearing this,  could not mistake ; he saw his preparations and hastened to depart, the more quickly to make known to the king what was going on. When  saw him return without , he did not stop to reflect, but in his rage and fury had ' ears and nose cut off.\nThe rest of the , who were until now ' friends, seeing this outrage done to the man who was most prominent among them, changed sides without delay and offered themselves to .\n\n\nLearning of this, too,  armed his guard and marched against the ; he had a bodyguard of  and , thirty thousand of them, and his royal palace was in the city of , a great and marvellous palace.\n\n' men marched against the , and so did ' men against the foreigners. So they both came to  and were going to make trial of one another.\n\n\nThe  are divided into seven classes: priests, warriors, cowherds, swineherds, merchants, interpreters, and pilots. There are this many classes, each named after its occupation.\nThe warriors are divided into  and , and they belong to the following districts (for all divisions in  are made according to districts).\n\n\nThe  are from the districts of , , , and , the island called , and half of from all of these; their number, at its greatest, attained to a hundred and sixty thousand. None of these has learned any common trade; they are free to follow the profession of arms alone.\n\n\nThe  are from the districts of \n, , , , , , , , , , ,  (this last is in an island opposite the city of )\n\nfrom all of these; their number, at its greatest, attained to two hundred and fifty thousand men. These too may practise no trade but war, which is their hereditary calling.\n\n\nNow whether this, too, the  have learned from the , I cannot confidently judge. I know that in  and  and  and  and nearly all foreign countries, those who learn trades are held in less esteem than the rest of the people, and those who have least to do with artisans' work, especially men who are free to practise the art of war, are highly honored.\nThis much is certain: that this opinion, which is held by all  and particularly by the , is of foreign origin. It is in  that artisans are held in least contempt.\n\n\nThe warriors were the only , except the priests, who had special privileges: for each of them an untaxed plot of twelve acres was set apart. This acre is a square of a hundred  cubits each way, the  cubit being equal to the .\nThese lands were set apart for all; it was never the same men who cultivated them, but each in turn. A thousand  and as many  were the king's annual bodyguard. These men, besides their lands, each received a daily provision of five minae's weight of roast grain, two minae of beef, and four cups of wine. These were the gifts received by each bodyguard.\n\n\nWhen  with his guards and  with the whole force of  came to the town of , they engaged; and though the foreigners fought well, they were vastly outnumbered, and therefore were beaten.\n\n, they say, supposed that not even a god could depose him from his throne, so firmly did he think he was established; and now, defeated in battle and taken captive, he was brought to , to the royal dwelling which belonged to him once but now belonged to .\nThere, he was kept alive for a while in the palace and well treated by . But presently the  complained that there was no justice in keeping alive one who was their own and their king's bitterest enemy; whereupon  gave  up to them, and they strangled him and then buried him in the burial-place of his fathers.\nThis is in the temple of , very near to the sanctuary, on the left of the entrance. The people of  buried within the temple precinct all kings who were natives of their district.\nThe tomb of  is farther from the sanctuary than the tomb of  and his ancestors; yet it, too, is within the temple court; it is a great colonnade of stone, richly adorned, the pillars made in the form of palm trees. In this colonnade are two portals, and the place where the coffin lies is within their doors.\n\n\nThere is also at  the burial-place of one whose name I think it impious to mention in speaking of such a matter; it is in the temple of , behind and close to the length of the wall of the shrine.\nMoreover, great stone obelisks stand in the precinct; and there is a lake nearby, adorned with a stone margin and made in a complete circle; it is, as it seemed to me, the size of the lake at  which they call the .\n\n\nOn this lake they enact by night the story of the god's sufferings, a rite which the  call the Mysteries. I could say more about this, for I know the truth, but let me preserve a discreet silence.\nLet me preserve a discreet silence, too, concerning that rite of  which the  call  , except as much of it as I am not forbidden to mention.\nThe daughters of  were those who brought this rite out of  and taught it to the  women; afterwards, when the people of the  were driven out by the , it was lost, except in so far as it was preserved by the , the  people which was not driven out but left in its home.\n\n\nAfter  was deposed,  became king; he was from a town called  in the district of .\nNow at first he was scorned and held in low regard by the  on the ground that he was a common man and of no high family; but presently he won them over by being shrewd and not arrogant.\nHe had among his countless treasures a golden washbowl, in which he and all those who ate with him were accustomed to clean their feet. This he broke in pieces and out of it made a god's image, which he set in a most conspicuous spot in the city; and the  came frequently to this image and held it in great reverence.\nWhen  learned what the townsfolk were doing, he called the  together and told them that the image had been made out of the washbowl, in which  had once vomited and urinated and cleaned their feet, but which now they greatly revered.\n\nNow then, he said, I have fared like the washbowl, since if before I was a common man, still, I am your king now. And he told them to honor and show respect for him.\n\n\nThe following was how he scheduled his affairs: in the morning, until the the hour when the marketplace filled, he readily conducted whatever business was brought to him; the rest of the day, he drank and joked at the expense of his companions and was idle and playful.\nBut this displeased his friends, who admonished him thus: O King, you do not conduct yourself well by indulging too much in vulgarity. You, a celebrated man, ought to conduct your business throughout the day, sitting on a celebrated throne; and thus the  would know that they are governed by a great man, and you would be better spoken of; as it is, what you do is by no means kingly.\nBut he answered them like this: Men that have bows string them when they must use them, and unstring them when they have used them; were bows kept strung forever, they would break, and so could not be used when needed.\nSuch, too, is the nature of man. Were one to be always at serious work and not permit oneself a bit of relaxation, he would go mad or idiotic before he knew it; I am well aware of that, and give each of the two its turn. Such was his answer to his friends.\n\n\nIt is said that even when  was a private man he was fond of drinking and joking and was not at all a sober man; and that when his drinking and pleasure-seeking cost him the bare necessities, he would go around stealing. Then when he contradicted those who said that he had their possessions, they would bring him to whatever place of divination was nearby, and sometimes the oracles declared him guilty and sometimes they acquitted him.\nWhen he became king, he did not take care of the shrines of the gods who had acquitted him of theft, or give them anything for maintenance, or make it his practice to sacrifice there, for he knew them to be worthless and their oracles false; but he took scrupulous care of the gods who had declared his guilt, considering them to be gods in very deed and their oracles infallible.\n\n\n made a marvellous outer court for the temple of  at , far surpassing all in its height and size, and in the size and quality of the stone blocks; moreover, he set up huge images and vast man-headed sphinxes, and brought enormous blocks of stone besides for the building.\nSome of these he brought from the stone quarries of ; the largest came from the city of , twenty days' journey distant by river from .\nBut what I admire most of his works is this: he brought from  a shrine made of one single block of stone; its transport took three years and two thousand men had the carriage of it, all of them pilots. This chamber is thirty-five feet long, twenty-three feet wide, thirteen feet high.\nThese are the external dimensions of the chamber which is made of one block; its internal dimensions are: thirty-one feet long, twenty feet wide, eight feet high. It stands at the entrance of the temple;\n\nit was not dragged within (so they say) because while it was being drawn the chief builder complained aloud of the great expense of time and his loathing of the work, and  taking this to heart would not let it be drawn further. Some also say that a man, one of those who heaved up the shrine, was crushed by it, and therefore it was not dragged within.\n\n\nFurthermore,  dedicated, besides monuments of marvellous size in all the other temples of note, the huge image that lies supine before ' temple at ; this image is seventy-five feet in length; there stand on the same base, on either side of the great image, two huge statues hewn from the same block, each of them twenty feet high.\nThere is at  another stone figure of like size, supine as is the figure at . It was , too, who built the great and most marvellous temple of  at .\n\n\nIt is said that in the reign of   attained to its greatest prosperity, in respect of what the river did for the land and the land for its people: and that the number of inhabited cities in the country was twenty thousand.\nIt was  also who made the law that every  declare his means of livelihood to the ruler of his district annually, and that omitting to do so or to prove that one had a legitimate livelihood be punishable with death.  the  got this law from  and established it among his people; may they always have it, for it is a perfect law.\n\n\n became a philhellene, and besides other services which he did for some of the , he gave those who came to  the city of  to live in; and to those who travelled to the country without wanting to settle there, he gave lands where they might set up altars and make holy places for their gods.\nOf these the greatest and most famous and most visited precinct is that which is called the , founded jointly by the  cities of , , , and , the  cities of , , , and Phaselis, and one  city, .\nIt is to these that the precinct belongs, and these are the cities that furnish overseers of the trading port; if any other cities advance claims, they claim what does not belong to them. The  made a precinct of their own, sacred to ; and so did the  for  and the  for .\n\n\n was in the past the only trading port in . Whoever came to any other mouth of the  had to swear that he had not come intentionally, and had then to take his ship and sail to the ; or if he could not sail against contrary winds, he had to carry his cargo in barges around the Delta until he came to . In such esteem was  held.\n\n\nWhen the  paid three hundred talents to have the temple that now stands at  finished (as that which was formerly there burnt down by accident), it was the ' lot to pay a fourth of the cost.\nThey went about from city to city collecting gifts, and got most from ; for  gave them a thousand talents' weight of astringent earth, and the  settlers in  twenty minae.\n\n\n made friends and allies of the people of . And he decided to marry from there, either because he had his heart set on a  wife, or for the sake of the ' friendship;\n\nin any case, he married a certain , said by some to be the daughter of , of  by others, and by others again of , an esteemed citizen of the place. But whenever  lay with her, he became unable to have intercourse, though he managed with every other woman;\n\nand when this happened repeatedly,  said to the woman called , Woman, you have cast a spell on me, and there is no way that you shall avoid perishing the most wretchedly of all women.\nSo , when the king did not relent at all although she denied it, vowed in her heart to  that, if  could have intercourse with her that night, since that would remedy the problem, she would send a statue to  to her. And after the prayer, immediately,  did have intercourse with her. And whenever  came to her thereafter, he had intercourse, and he was very fond of her after this.\n\n paid her vow to the goddess; she had an image made and sent it to , where it stood safe until my time, facing outside the city. , when he had conquered  and learned who  was, sent her away to  unharmed.\n\n\nMoreover,  dedicated offerings in . He gave to  a gilt image of  and a painted picture of himself; to  of , two stone images and a marvellous linen breast-plate; and to  in , two wooden statues of himself that were still standing in my time behind the doors in the great shrine.\nThe offerings in  were dedicated because of the friendship between  and , son of ; what he gave to  was not out of friendship for anyone, but because the temple of  in  is said to have been founded by the daughters of , when they landed there in their flight from the sons of . Such were ' offerings. Moreover, he was the first conqueror of , which he made tributary to himself."}}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "3", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "1", "@unit": "section"},

There was a daughter of the former king , all that was left of that family, quite tall and pretty, and her name was ; this girl  adorned with clothes and gold and sent to  as his own daughter.\nBut after a time, as he embraced her addressing her as the daughter of , the girl said to him, O King, you do not understand how you have been made a fool of by , who dressed me in finery and sent me to you as his own daughter, when I am in fact the daughter of , the ruler  revolted from with the  and killed.\nThis speech and this crime that occurred turned ' son , furiously angry, against . So the  say.\n\n\nBut the , who say that  was the son of this daughter of , claim him as one of theirs; they say that it was  who asked  for his daughter, and not .\nBut what they say is false. They are certainly not unaware (for if any understand the customs of the  the  do) firstly, that it is not their custom for illegitimate offspring to rule when there are legitimate offspring; and secondly, that  was the son of , the daughter of , who was an , and not of the  woman. But they falsify the story, pretending to be related to the house of . That is the truth of the matter.\n\n\nThe following story, incredible to me, is also told: that one of the  women who came to visit ' wives, and saw the tall and attractive children who stood by , expressed her admiration in extravagant terms. Then , ' wife, said,\n\nAlthough I am the mother of such children,  dishonors me and honors his new woman from . So she spoke in her bitterness against ; and , the eldest of her sons, said,\n\nThen, mother, when I am grown up, I will turn all  upside down. When he said this, he was about ten years old, and the women were amazed; but he kept it in mind, and it was thus that when he grew up and became king, he made the campaign against .\n\n\nIt so happened, too, that something else occurred contributing to this campaign. There was among ' mercenaries a man who was a  by birth, a clever man and a good soldier, whose name was .\nThis  had some grudge against , and fled from  aboard ship, hoping to talk to . Since he was a man much admired among the mercenaries and had an exact knowledge of all  matters,  was anxious to catch him, and sent a trireme with his most trusted eunuch to pursue him. This eunuch caught him in  but never brought him back to , for  was too clever for him.\nHe made his guards drunk and so escaped to . There he found  prepared to set out against , but in doubt as to his march, how he should cross the waterless desert; so  showed him what was ' condition and how he should march; as to this, he advised  to send and ask the king of the  for a safe passage.\n\n\nNow the only apparent way of entry into  is this. The road runs from  as far as the borders of the city of , which belongs to the so-called  of .\nFrom  (which, as I judge, is a city not much smaller than ) to the city of  the seaports belong to the ; then they are  again from  as far as the  marsh, beside which the  promontory stretches seawards;\n\nfrom this  marsh, where  is supposed to have been hidden, the country is . Now between  and the  and the  marsh there lies a wide territory for as much as three days' journey, terribly arid.\n\n\nI am going to mention something now which few of those who sail to  know. Earthen jars full of wine are brought into  twice a year from all  and  besides: yet one might safely say there is not a single empty wine jar anywhere in the country.\nWhat then (one may ask) becomes of them? I shall explain this too. Each governor of a district must gather in all the earthen pots from his own township and take them to , and the people of  must fill them with water and carry them to those arid lands of ; so the earthen pottery that is brought to  and unloaded or emptied there is carried to  to join the stock that has already been taken there.\n\n\nNow as soon as the  took possession of , they became the caretakers of the entryway into it, having it provisioned with water in the way I have described.\nBut at this time there was as yet no ready supply of water; and so , hearing what was said by the stranger from , sent messengers to the  and asked and obtained safe conduct, giving to him and receiving from him pledges.\n\n\nThere are no men who respect pledges more than the . This is how they give them: a man stands between the two pledging parties, and with a sharp stone cuts the palms of their hands, near the thumb; then he takes a piece of wood from the cloak of each and smears with their blood seven stones that lie between them, meanwhile calling on  and the Heavenly ;\n\nafter this is done, the one who has given his pledge commends the stranger (or his countryman if the other be one) to his friends, and his friends hold themselves bound to honor the pledge.\nThey believe in no other gods except  and the Heavenly ; and they say that they wear their hair as  does his, cutting it round the head and shaving the temples. They call , ; and , .\n\n\nWhen, then, the  had made the pledge to the messengers who had come from , he devised the following expedient: he filled camel-skins with water and loaded all his camels with these; then he drove them into the waterless land and there awaited ' army.\nThis is the most credible of the stories told; but I must relate the less credible tale also, since they tell it. There is a great river in  called , emptying into the sea called Red.\nFrom this river (it is said) the king of the  brought water by an aqueduct made of sewn oxhides and other hides and extensive enough to reach to the dry country; and he had great tanks dug in that country to try to receive and keep the water.\nIt is a twelve days' journey from the river to that desert. By three aqueducts (they say) he brought the water to three different places.\n\n\n, son of , was encamped by the mouth of the  called , awaiting .\nFor when  marched against , he found  no longer alive; he had died after reigning forty-four years, during which he had suffered no great misfortune; and being dead he was embalmed and laid in the burial-place built for him in the temple.\nWhile his son  was king of , the people saw an extraordinary thing, namely, rain at \n of , where, as the  themselves say, there had never been rain before, nor since to my lifetime; for indeed there is no rain at all in the upper parts of ; but at that time a drizzle of rain fell at \n.\n\n\nWhen the  had crossed the waterless country and encamped near the  intending to engage them, the  mercenaries,  and , devised a plan to punish , angered at him for leading a foreign army into .\n\n had left sons in ; these they brought to the camp, into their father's sight, and set a great bowl between the two armies; then they brought the sons one by one and cut their throats over the bowl.\nWhen all the sons had been slaughtered, they poured wine and water into the bowl, and the mercenaries drank this and then gave battle. The fighting was fierce, and many of both armies fell; but at last the  were routed.\n\n\nI saw a strange thing on the site of the battle, of which the people of the country had told me. The bones of those killed on either side in this fight lying scattered separately (for the  bones lay in one place and the  in another, where the armies had first separately stood), the skulls of the  are so brittle that if you throw no more than a pebble it will pierce them, but the  skulls are so strong that a blow of a stone will hardly crack them.\nAnd this, the people said (which for my own part I readily believed), is the explanation of it: the  shave their heads from childhood, and the bone thickens by exposure to the sun.\nThis also is the reason why they do not grow bald; for nowhere can one see so few bald heads as in .\nTheir skulls then are strong for this reason; while the  skulls are weak because they cover their heads throughout their lives with the felt hats (called tiaras) which they wear. Such is the truth of the matter. I saw too the skulls of those  at  who were killed with ' son  by  the , and they were like the others.\n\n\nAfter their rout in the battle the  fled in disorder; and when they had been overtaken in ,  sent a  herald up the river aboard a  boat to invite the  to an accord.\nBut when they saw the boat coming to , they sallied out all together from their walls, destroyed the boat, dismembered the crew (like butchers) and carried them within the walls.\nSo the  were besieged, and after a long while surrendered; but the neighboring , frightened by what had happened in , surrendered without a fight, laying tribute on themselves and sending gifts; and so too did the people of  and , frightened like the .\n\n received in all kindness the gifts of the ; but he seized what came from  and, displeased, I think, because it was so littlefor the  had sent five hundred silver minaecast it with his own hands among his army.\n\n\nOn the tenth day after the surrender of the walled city of ,  took  king of , who had reigned for six months, and confined him in the outer part of the city with other , to insult him; having confined him there, he tried ' spirit, as I shall show.\nHe dressed the daughter of the king as a slave and sent her out with a pitcher to fetch water, together with other girls from the families of the leading men, dressed like the daughter of the king.\nSo when the girls went out before their fathers' eyes crying and lamenting, all the rest answered with cries and weeping, seeing their children abused; but , having seen with his own eyes and learned all, bowed himself to the ground.\nAfter the water-carriers had passed by,  next made ' son go out before him with two thousand  of the same age, all with ropes bound round their necks and bridle-bits in their mouths;\n\nthey were led out to be punished for those  who had perished with their boat at ; for such was the judgment of the royal judges, that every man's death be paid for by the deaths of ten noble .\nWhen  saw them passing and perceived that his son was being led out to die, and all the  who sat with him wept and showed their affliction, he did as he had done at the sight of his daughter.\nAfter these too had gone out, it happened that there was one of his companions, a man past his prime, who had lost all his possessions, and had only what a poor man might have, and begged of the army; this man now went out before  son of  and the  confined in the outer part of the city. When  saw him, he broke into loud weeping, striking his head and calling on his companion by name.\nNow there were men set to watch , who told  all that he did as each went forth. Wondering at what the king did,  made this inquiry of him by a messenger:\n\n,  wants to know why, seeing your daughter abused and your son going to his death, you did not cry out or weep, yet you showed such feeling for the beggar, who (as  learns from others) is not one of your kindred? So the messenger inquired.  answered:\n\nSon of , my private grief was too great for weeping; but the unhappiness of my companion deserves tearsa man fallen from abundance and prosperity to beggary come to the threshold of old age. When the messenger reported this,  and his court, it is said, thought the answer good.\nAnd, the  say,  wept (for it happened that he too had come with  to ) and the  that were there wept;  himself felt some pity, and he ordered that ' son be spared from those that were to be executed, and that  himself be brought in from the outer part of the city and brought before him.\n\n\nThose that went for him found that the son was no longer alive, but had been the first to be slaughtered; but they brought  up and led him to ; and there he lived, and no violence was done him for the rest of his life.\nAnd if he had known how to mind his own business, he would have regained  to govern; for the  are inclined to honor kings' sons; even though kings revolt from them, they give back to their sons the sovereign power.\nThere are many instances showing that it is their custom so to do, and notably the giving back of his father's sovereign power to  son of , and also to  son of ; yet none ever did the  more harm than  and .\nBut as it was,  plotted evil and got his reward; for he was caught raising a revolt among the ; and when  heard of it,  drank bull's blood and died. Such was his end.\n\n\nFrom   went to the city Sais, anxious to do exactly what he did do. Entering the house of , he had the body of  carried outside from its place of burial; and when this had been done, he gave orders to scourge it and pull out the hair and pierce it with goads, and to desecrate it in every way.\nWhen they were weary of doing this (for the body, being embalmed, remained whole and did not fall to pieces),  gave orders to burn it, a sacrilegious command; for the  hold fire to be a god;\n\ntherefore neither nation thinks it right to burn the dead, the  for the reason given, as they say it is wrong to give the dead body of a man to a god; while the  believe fire to be a living beast that devours all that it catches, and when sated with its meal dies together with that on which it feeds.\nNow it is by no means their custom to give the dead to beasts; and this is why they embalm the corpse, that it may not lie and feed worms. Thus what  commanded was contrary to the custom of both peoples.\nThe  say, however, that it was not  to whom this was done, but another  of the same age as , whom the  abused thinking that they were abusing .\nFor their story is that  learned from an oracle what was to be done to him after his death, and so to escape this fate buried this dead man, the one that was scourged, near the door inside his own vault, and ordered his son that he himself should be laid in the farthest corner of the vault.\nI think that these commands of , regarding the burial-place and the man, were never given at all, and that the  believe in them in vain.\n\n\nAfter this  planned three expeditions, against the , against the , and against the long-lived , who inhabit that part of  that is on the southern sea.\nHe decided after consideration to send his fleet against the  and a part of his land army against the ; to  he would first send spies, to see what truth there was in the story of a Table of the Sun in that country, and to spy out all else besides, under the pretext of bringing gifts for the  king.\n\n\nNow the Table of the Sun is said to be something of this kind: there is a meadow outside the city, filled with the boiled flesh of all four-footed things; here during the night the men of authority among the townsmen are careful to set out the meat, and all day whoever wishes comes and feasts on it. These meats, say the people of the country, are ever produced by the earth of itself. Such is the story of the Sun's Table.\n\n\nWhen  determined to send the spies, he sent for those  from the city of  who understood the  language.\nWhile they were fetching them, he ordered his fleet to sail against . But the  said they would not do it; for they were bound, they said, by strong oaths, and if they sailed against their own progeny they would be doing an impious thing; and the  being unwilling, the rest were inadequate fighters.\nThus the  escaped being enslaved by the ; for  would not use force with the , seeing that they had willingly surrendered to the , and the whole fleet drew its strength from them. The  too had come of their own accord to aid the  against .\n\n\nWhen the  arrived from  at ' summons, he sent them to , with orders what to say, and bearing as gifts a red cloak and a twisted gold necklace and bracelets and an alabaster box of incense and an earthenware jar of palm wine. These , to whom  sent them, are said to be the tallest and most handsome of all men.\nTheir way of choosing kings is different from that of all others, as (it is said) are all their laws; they consider that man worthy to be their king whom they judge to be tallest and to have strength proportional to his stature.\n\n\nWhen the  arrived among these men, they gave the gifts to their king and said: , the king of the , wishing to become your friend and ally, sent us with orders to address ourselves to you; and he offers you as gifts these things which he enjoys using himself.\nBut the , perceiving that they had come as spies, spoke thus to them: It is not because he values my friendship that the  sends you with gifts, nor do you speak the truth (for you have come to spy on my realm), nor is that man just; for were he just, he would not have coveted a land other than his own, nor would he try to lead into slavery men by whom he has not been injured. Now, give him this bow, and this message:\n\nThe King of the  advises the King of the  to bring overwhelming odds to attack the long-lived  when the  can draw a bow of this length as easily as I do; but until then, to thank the gods who do not incite the sons of the  to add other land to their own.\n\n\nSo speaking he unstrung the bow and gave it to the men who had come. Then, taking the red cloak, he asked what it was and how it was made; and when the  told him the truth about the color and the process of dyeing, he said that both the men and their garments were full of deceit.\nNext he inquired about the twisted gold necklace and the bracelets; and when the  told him how they were made, the king smiled, and, thinking them to be fetters, said: We have stronger chains than these.\nThirdly he inquired about the incense; and when they described making and applying it, he made the same reply as about the cloak. But when he came to the wine and asked about its making, he was vastly pleased with the drink, and asked further what food their king ate, and what was the greatest age to which a  lived.\nThey told him their king ate bread, showing him how wheat grew; and said that the full age to which a man might hope to live was eighty years. Then, said the , it was no wonder that they lived so few years, if they ate dung; they would not even have been able to live that many unless they were refreshed by the drinksignifying to the  the winefor in this, he said, the  excelled the .\n\n\nThe  then in turn asking of the  length of life and diet, he said that most of them attained to a hundred and twenty years, and some even to more; their food was boiled meat and their drink milk.\nThe spies showed wonder at the tale of years; whereupon he led them, it is said, to a spring, by washing in which they grew sleeker, as though it were of oil; and it smelled of violets.\nSo light, the spies said, was this water, that nothing would float on it, neither wood nor anything lighter than wood, but all sank to the bottom. If this water is truly such as they say, it is likely that their constant use of it makes the people long-lived.\nWhen they left the spring, the king led them to a prison where all the men were bound with fetters of gold. Among these  there is nothing so scarce and so precious as bronze. Then, having seen the prison, they saw what is called the Table of the Sun.\n\nLast after this they viewed the  coffins; these are said to be made of alabaster, as I shall describe:\n\nthey cause the dead body to shrink, either as the  do or in some other way, then cover it with gypsum and paint it all as far as possible in the likeness of the living man;\n\nthen they set it within a hollow pillar of alabaster, which they dig in abundance from the ground, and it is easily worked; the body can be seen in the pillar through the alabaster, no evil stench nor anything unpleasant proceeding from it, and showing clearly all its parts, as if it were the man himself.\nThe nearest of kin keep the pillar in their house for a year, giving it of the first-fruits and offering it sacrifices; after which they bring the pillars out and set them round about the city.\n\n\nHaving seen everything, the spies departed again. When they reported all this,  was angry, and marched at once against the , neither giving directions for any provision of food nor considering that he was about to lead his army to the ends of the earth;\n\nbeing not in his right mind but mad, however, he marched at once on hearing from the , ordering the  who were with him to await him where they were, and taking with him all his land army.\nWhen he came in his march to \n, he detached about fifty thousand men from his army, and directed them to enslave the  and burn the oracle of ; and he himself went on towards  with the rest of his host.\nBut before his army had accomplished the fifth part of their journey they had come to an end of all there was in the way of provision, and after the food was gone, they ate the beasts of burden until there was none of these left either.\nNow had , when he perceived this, changed his mind and led his army back again, he would have been a wise man at last after his first fault; but as it was, he went ever forward, taking account of nothing.\nWhile his soldiers could get anything from the earth, they kept themselves alive by eating grass; but when they came to the sandy desert, some did a terrible thing, taking by lot one man out of ten and eating him.\nHearing this,  feared their becoming cannibals, and so gave up his expedition against the  and marched back to \n, with the loss of many of his army; from \n he came down to , and sent the  to sail away.\n\n\nSo fared the expedition against . As for those who were sent to march against the , they set out and journeyed from \n with guides; and it is known that they came to the city of Oasis, inhabited by  said to be of the  tribe, seven days' march from \n across sandy desert; this place is called, in the  language, .\nThus far, it is said, the army came; after that, except for the  themselves and those who heard from them, no man can say anything of them; for they neither reached the  nor returned back.\nBut this is what the  themselves say: when the  were crossing the sand from Oasis to attack them, and were about midway between their country and Oasis, while they were breakfasting a great and violent south wind arose, which buried them in the masses of sand which it bore; and so they disappeared from sight. Such is the  tale about this army.\n\n\nWhen  was back at , there appeared in  that  whom the  call ; at whose epiphany the  put on their best clothing and held a festival.\nSeeing the  so doing,  was fully persuaded that these signs of joy were for his misfortunes, and summoned the rulers of ; when they came before him, he asked them why the  behaved so at the moment he returned with so many of his army lost, though they had done nothing like it when he was before at .\nThe rulers told him that a god, wont to appear after long intervals of time, had now appeared to them; and that all  rejoiced and made holiday whenever he so appeared. At this  said that they lied, and he punished them with death for their lie.\n\n\nHaving put them to death, he next summoned the priests before him. When they gave him the same account, he said that if a tame god had come to the  he would know it; and with no more words he bade the priests bring . So they went to fetch and bring him.\nThis , or , is a calf born of a cow that can never conceive again. By what the  say, the cow is made pregnant by a light from heaven, and thereafter gives birth to .\nThe marks of this calf called  are these: he is black, and has on his forehead a three-cornered white spot, and the likeness of an eagle on his back; the hairs of the tail are double, and there is a knot under the tongue.\n\n\nWhen the priests led  in, for he was all but maddrew his dagger and, meaning to stab the calf in the belly, stuck the thigh; then laughing he said to the priests:\n\nSimpletons, are these your gods, creatures of flesh and blood that can feel weapons of iron? That is a god worthy of the . But for you, you shall suffer for making me your laughing-stock. So saying he bade those, whose business it was, to scourge the priests well, and to kill any other  whom they found holiday-making.\nSo the  festival ended, and the priests were punished, and  lay in the temple and died of the wound in the thigh. When he was dead of the wound, the priests buried him without ' knowledge.\n\n\nBut , the  say, owing to this wrongful act immediately went mad, although even before he had not been sensible. His first evil act was to destroy his full brother , whom he had sent away from  to  out of jealousy, because  alone could draw the bow brought from the  by the  as far as two fingerbreadths, but no other  could draw it.\n\n having gone to ,  saw in a dream a vision, in which it seemed to him that a messenger came from  and told him that  sitting on the royal throne touched heaven with his head.\nFearing therefore for himself, lest his brother might slay him and so be king, he sent , the most trusted of his , to  to kill him.  went up to  and killed ; some say that he took  out hunting, others that he brought him to the Red Sea and there drowned him.\n\n\nThis, they say, was the first of ' evil acts; next, he destroyed his full sister, who had come with him to , and whom he had taken to wife.\nHe married her in this way (for before this, it had by no means been customary for  to marry their sisters):  was infatuated with one of his sisters and when he wanted to marry her, because his intention was contrary to usage, he summoned the royal judges and inquired whether there were any law enjoining one, that so desired, to marry his sister.\nThese royal judges are men chosen out from the  to function until they die or are detected in some injustice; it is they who decide suits in  and interpret the laws of the land; all matters are referred to them.\nThese then replied to  with an answer which was both just and prudent, namely, that they could find no law enjoining a brother to marry his sister; but that they had found a law permitting the King of  to do whatever he liked.\nThus, although they feared  they did not break the law, and, to save themselves from death for keeping it, they found another law abetting one who wished to marry sisters.\nSo  married the object of his desire; yet not long afterwards he took another sister as well. It was the younger of these who had come with him to , and whom he now killed.\n\n\nThere are two tales of her death, as there are of the death of . The  say that  had set a lion cub to fight a puppy, and that this woman was watching too; and that as the puppy was losing, its brother broke its leash and came to help, and the two dogs together got the better of the cub.\n\n, they say, was pleased with the sight, but the woman wept as she sat by.  perceiving it asked why she wept, and she said that when she saw the puppy help its brother she had wept, recalling  and knowing that there would be no avenger for him.\nFor saying this, according to the  story, she was killed by . But the  tale is that as the two sat at table the woman took a lettuce and plucked off the leaves, then asked her husband whether he preferred the look of it with or without leaves. With the leaves, he said; whereupon she answered:\n\nYet you have stripped ' house as bare as this lettuce. Angered at this, they say, he sprang upon her, who was great with child, and she miscarried and died of the hurt he gave her.\n\n\nSuch were ' mad acts to his own household, whether they were done because of  or grew from some of the many troubles that are wont to beset men; for indeed he is said to have been afflicted from his birth with that grievous disease which some call sacred. It is not unlikely then that when his body was grievously afflicted his mind too should be diseased.\n\n\nI will now relate his mad dealings with the rest of . He said, as they report, to whom he held in particular honor, who brought him all his messages, whose son held the very honorable office of ' cup-bearerthus, I say, he spoke to :\n\nWhat manner of man, , do the  think me to be, and how do they speak of me? Sire, said , for all else they greatly praise you, but they say that you love wine too well.\nSo he reported of the . The king angrily replied: If the  now say that it is my fondness for wine that drives me to frenzy and madness, then it would seem that their former saying also was a lie.\nFor it is said that before this, while some  and  were sitting with him,  asked what manner of man they thought him to be in comparison with  his father; and they answered,  was the better man; for he had all of ' possessions and had won  and the sea besides.\nSo said the ; but , who was present, and was dissatisfied with their judgment, spoke thus to : To me, son of , you do not seem to be the equal of your father; for you have as yet no son such as he left after him in you. This pleased , and he praised ' judgment.\n\n\nRemembering this, then, he said to  in his anger: Judge then if the  speak the truth, or rather are themselves out of their minds when they speak of me so.\nYonder stands your son in the porch; now if I shoot and pierce his heart, that will prove the  to be wrong; if I miss, then say that they are right and that I am out of my senses.\nSo saying, he strung his bow and hit the boy, and gave orders to open the fallen body and examine the wound: and the arrow being found in the heart,  laughed in great glee and said to the boy's father:\n\nIt is plain, , that I am in my right mind and the  mad; now tell me: what man in the world did you ever see that shot so true to the mark? , it is said, replied (for he saw that  was mad, and he feared for his own life), Master, I think that not even the god himself could shoot so true.\nThus did  then; at another time he took twelve , equal to the noblest in the land, convicted them of some minor offense, and buried them alive up to the neck.\n\n\nFor these acts  the  thought fit to take him to task, and addressed him thus: Sire, do not sacrifice everything to youth and temper, but restrain and control yourself; prudence is a good thing, forethought is wise. But you kill men of your own country whom you have convicted of some minor offense, and you kill boys.\nIf you do so often, beware lest the  revolt from you. As for me, your father  earnestly begged me to counsel you and to give you such advice as I think to be good.  gave him this counsel out of goodwill; but  answered:\n\nIt is very well that you should even dare to counsel me; you, who governed your own country so well, and gave fine advice to my fathertelling him, when the  were willing to cross over into our lands, to pass the  and attack them; thus you worked your own ruin by misgoverning your country and ', who trusted you. But you shall regret it; I have long waited for an occasion to deal with you.\nWith that  took his bow to shoot him dead; but  leapt up and ran out; and , being unable to shoot him, ordered his attendants to catch and kill him.\nThey, knowing ' mood, hid ; intending to reveal him and receive gifts for saving his life, if  should repent and ask for , but if he should not repent nor wish  back, then to kill the .\nNot long after this  did wish  back, and the attendants, understanding this, told him that  was alive still.  said that he was glad of it; but that they, who had saved , should not escape with impunity, but be killed; and this was done.\n\n\n committed many such mad acts against the  and his allies; he stayed at , and there opened ancient coffins and examined the dead bodies.\nThus too he entered the temple of  and jeered at the image there. This image of  is most like the  , which the  carry on the prows of their triremes. I will describe it for anyone who has not seen these figures: it is the likeness of a dwarf.\nAlso he entered the temple of the , into which no one may enter save the priest; the images here he even burnt, with bitter mockery. These also are like the images of , and are said to be his sons.\n\n\nI hold it then in every way proved that  was quite insane; or he would never have set himself to deride religion and custom. For if it were proposed to all nations to choose which seemed best of all customs, each, after examination, would place its own first; so well is each convinced that its own are by far the best.\nIt is not therefore to be supposed that anyone, except a madman, would turn such things to ridicule. I will give this one proof among many from which it may be inferred that all men hold this belief about their customs.\nWhen  was king, he summoned the  who were with him and asked them for what price they would eat their fathers' dead bodies. They answered that there was no price for which they would do it.\nThen  summoned those  who are called , who eat their parents, and asked them (the  being present and understanding through interpreters what was said) what would make them willing to burn their fathers at death. The  cried aloud, that he should not speak of so horrid an act. So firmly rooted are these beliefs; and it is, I think, rightly said in 's poem that custom is lord of all.\n\nWhile  was attacking , the  too were making war upon  and upon ' son , who had revolted and won .\nAnd first, dividing the city into three parts, he gave a share in the government to his brothers  and ; but presently he put one of them to death, banished the younger, , and so made himself lord of all ; then he made a treaty with  king of , sending to him and receiving from him gifts.\nVery soon after this,  grew to such power that he was famous in  and all other  lands; for all his military affairs succeeded. He had a hundred fifty-oared ships, and a thousand archers.\nAnd he pillaged every place, indiscriminately; for he said that he would get more thanks if he gave a friend back what he had taken than if he never took it at all. He had taken many of the islands, and many of the mainland cities. Among others, he conquered the ; they had brought all their force to aid the , and  defeated them in a sea-fight; it was they who, being his captives, dug all the trench around the acropolis of .\n\n\nNow  was somehow aware of ' great good fortune; and as this continued to increase greatly, he wrote this letter and sent it to :  addresses  as follows.\nIt is pleasant to learn that a friend and ally is doing well. But I do not like these great successes of yours; for I know the gods, how jealous they are, and I desire somehow that both I and those for whom I care succeed in some affairs, fail in others, and thus pass life faring differently by turns, rather than succeed at everything.\nFor from all I have heard I know of no man whom continual good fortune did not bring in the end to evil, and utter destruction. Therefore if you will be ruled by me do this regarding your successes:\n\nconsider what you hold most precious and what you will be sorriest to lose, and cast it away so that it shall never again be seen among men; then, if after this the successes that come to you are not mixed with mischances, strive to mend the matter as I have counselled you.\n\n\nReading this, and perceiving that ' advice was good,  considered which of his treasures it would most grieve his soul to lose, and came to this conclusion: he wore a seal set in gold, an emerald, crafted by  son of  of ;\n\nbeing resolved to cast this away, he embarked in a fifty-oared ship with its crew, and told them to put out to sea; and when he was far from the island, he took off the seal-ring in sight of all that were on the ship and cast it into the sea. This done, he sailed back and went to his house, where he grieved for the loss.\n\n\nBut on the fifth or sixth day from this it happened that a fisherman, who had taken a fine and great fish, and desired to make a gift of it to , brought it to the door and said that he wished to see . This being granted, he gave the fish, saying:\n\nO King, when I caught this fish, I thought best not to take it to market, although I am a man who lives by his hands, but it seemed to me worthy of you and your greatness; and so I bring and offer it to you.  was pleased with what the fisherman said; You have done very well, he answered, and I give you double thanks, for your words and for the gift; and I invite you to dine with me.\nProud of this honor, the fisherman went home; but the servants, cutting up the fish, found in its belly ' seal-ring.\nAs soon as they saw and seized it, they brought it with joy to , and giving the ring to him told him how it had been found.  saw the hand of heaven in this matter; he wrote a letter and sent it to , telling all that he had done, and what had happened to him.\n\n\nWhen  had read ' letter, he perceived that no man could save another from his destiny, and that , being so continually fortunate that he even found what he cast away, must come to an evil end.\nSo he sent a herald to  to renounce his friendship, determined that when some great and terrible mischance overtook  he himself might not have to sadden his heart for a friend.\n\n\nIt was against this ever-victorious  that the  now made war, invited by the  who afterwards founded  in .  had without the knowledge of his subjects sent a herald to , son of , then raising an army against , inviting  to send to  too and request men from him.\nAt this message  very readily sent to , asking  to send a fleet to aid him against .  chose those men whom he most suspected of planning a rebellion against him, and sent them in forty triremes, directing  not to send the men back.\n\n\nSome say that these  who were sent never came to , but that when they had sailed as far as  discussed the matter among themselves and decided to sail no further; others say that they did come to  and there escaped from the guard that was set over them.\nBut as they sailed back to , ' ships met and engaged them; and the returning  were victorious and landed on the island, but were there beaten in a land battle, and so sailed to .\nThere are those who say that the  from  defeated ; but to my thinking this is untrue; for they need not have invited the  if in fact they had been able to master  by themselves. Besides, it is not even reasonable to suppose that he, who had a great army of hired soldiers and bowmen of his own, was beaten by a few men like the returning .\n\n took the children and wives of the townsmen who were subject to him and shut them up in the boathouses, with intent to burn them and the boathouses too if their men should desert to the returned .\n\n\nWhen the  who were expelled by  came to , they came before the ruling men and made a long speech to show the greatness of their need. But the  at their first sitting answered that they had forgotten the beginning of the speech and could not understand its end.\nAfter this the  came a second time with a sack, and said nothing but this: The sack wants flour. To this the  replied that they were over-wordy with the sack; but they did resolve to help them.\n\n\nThe  then equipped and sent an army to , returning a favor, as the  say, because they first sent a fleet to help the  against ; but the  say that they sent this army less to aid the  in their need than to avenge the robbery of the bowl which they had been carrying to  and the breastplate which  King of  had sent them as a gift.\nThis breastplate had been stolen by the  in the year before they took the bowl; it was of linen, decked with gold and cotton embroidery, and embroidered with many figures;\n\nbut what makes it worthy of wonder is that each thread of the breastplate, fine as each is, is made up of three hundred and sixty strands, each plainly seen. It is the exact counterpart of that one which  dedicated to  in .\n\n\nThe  also enthusiastically helped to further the expedition against . For an outrage had been done them by the  a generation before this expedition, about the time of the robbery of the bowl.\n\n son of  sent to  at  three hundred boys, sons of notable men in , to be made eunuchs. The  who brought the boys put in at ; and when the  heard why the boys were brought, first they instructed them to take sanctuary in the temple of ,\n\nthen they would not allow the suppliants to be dragged from the temple; and when the  tried to starve the boys out, the  held a festival which they still celebrate in the same fashion; throughout the time that the boys were seeking asylum, they held nightly dances of young men and women to which it was made a custom to bring cakes of sesame and honey, so that the  boys might snatch these and have food.\nThis continued to be done until the  guards left their charge and departed; then the  took the boys back to .\n\n\nIf after the death of , the  had been friendly towards the , they would not have taken part in the expedition against  for this reason. But as it was, ever since the island was colonized, they have been at odds with each other, despite their kinship.\nFor these reasons then the  bore a grudge against the . chose the sons of the notable  and sent them to  to be made eunuchs as an act of vengeance; for the  had first begun the quarrel by committing a terrible crime against him.\n\n\nFor after killing his own wife ,  suffered yet another calamity on top of what he had already suffered. He had two sons by , one seventeen and one eighteen years old.\nTheir mother's father, , the sovereign of , sent for the boys and treated them affectionately, as was natural, seeing that they were his own daughter's sons. When they left him, he said as he sent them forth:\n\nDo you know, boys, who killed your mother? The elder of them paid no attention to these words; but the younger, whose name was , was struck with such horror when he heard them that when he came to  he would not speak to his father, his mother's murderer, nor would he answer him when addressed nor reply to his questions. At last  was so angry that he drove the boy from his house.\n\n\nHaving driven this one away, he asked the elder son what their grandfather had said to them. The boy told him that  had treated them kindly, but did not mention what he had said at parting; for he had paid no attention.  said that by no means could  not have dropped some hint, and interrogated him persistently;\n\nuntil the boy remembered, and told him. And , comprehending, and wishing to show no weakness, sent a message to those with whom his banished son was living and forbade them to keep him.\nSo when the boy, driven out, would go to another house, he would be driven from this also, since  threatened all who received him and ordered them to shut him out; so when driven forth, he would go to some other house of his friends, and they, although he was the son of , and although they were afraid, nonetheless took him in.\n\n\nIn the end  made a proclamation, that whoever sheltered the boy in his house or spoke to him, would owe a fine to , and he set the amount.\nIn view of this proclamation no one wished to address or receive the boy into his house; and besides, the boy himself did not think it right to attempt what was forbidden, but accepting it slept in the open.\nOn the fourth day, when  saw him starved and unwashed, he took pity on him, and his anger being softened, he came near and said: My son, which is preferableto follow your present way of life, or by being well-disposed toward your father to inherit my power and the goods which I now possess?\nThough my son and a prince of prosperous , you prefer the life of a vagrant, by opposing and being angry with me with whom you least ought to be. For if something has happened as a result of which you have a suspicion about me, it has happened to my disadvantage and I bear the brunt of it, inasmuch as I am the cause.\nBut bearing in mind how much better it is to be envied than to be pitied, and at the same time what sort of thing it is to be angry with your parents and with those that are stronger than you, come back to the house.\nWith these words  tried to move his son, but he said nothing else to his father, only told him that because he had conversed with him he owed the fine to . When  saw that his son's stubbornness could not be got around or overcome, he sent him away out of his sight in a ship to ; for  too was subject to him.\nAnd when he had sent him away, he sent an army against  his father-in-law, since he was most to blame for his present troubles; and he took , captured , and imprisoned him.\n\n\nAs time went on, , now grown past his prime and aware that he could no longer oversee and direct all his affairs, sent to  inviting  to be sovereign; for he saw no hope in his eldest son, who seemed to him to be slow-witted.\n\n did not dignify the invitation with a reply. Then , pressing the young man, sent to him (as the next best way) his daughter, the boy's sister, thinking that he would listen to her.\nShe came and said, Child, would you want the power to fall to others, and our father's house destroyed, rather than to return and have it yourself? Come home and stop punishing yourself.\nPride is an unhappy possession. Do not cure evil by evil. Many place the more becoming thing before the just; and many pursuing their mother's business have lost their father's. Power is a slippery thing; many want it, and our father is now old and past his prime; do not lose what is yours to others.\nSo she spoke communicating their father's inducements. But he answered that he would never come to  as long as he knew his father was alive.\nWhen she brought this answer back,  sent a third messenger, through whom he proposed that he should go to , and that the boy should return to  and be the heir of his power.\nThe son consented to this;  got ready to go to  and  to go to ; but when the  learned of all these matters, they put the young man to death so that  would not come to their country. It was for this that  desired vengeance on the .\n\n\nThe  then came with a great army, and besieged . They advanced to the wall and entered the tower that stands by the seaside in the outer part of the city; but then  himself attacked them with a great force and drove them out.\nThe mercenaries and many of the  themselves sallied out near the upper tower on the ridge of the hill and withstood the  advance for a little while; then they fled back, with the  pursuing and destroying them.\n\n\nHad all the  there that day been like  and ,  would have been taken. These two alone entered the fortress along with the fleeing crowd of , and were cut off and killed in the city of .\nI myself have met in his native town of  another  son of , and grandson of the  mentioned above, who honored the  more than any other of his guest-friends, and told me that his father had borne the name  because he was the son of that  who was killed fighting bravely at . The reason that he honored the , he said, was that they had given his grandfather a public funeral.\n\nSo when the  had besieged  for forty days with no success, they went away to the .\nThere is a foolish tale abroad that  bribed them to depart by making and giving them a great number of gilded lead coins, as a native currency. This was the first expedition to  made by  of .\n\n\nWhen the  were about to abandon them, the  who had brought an army against  sailed away too, and went to ;\n\nfor they were in need of money; and the  were at this time very prosperous and the richest of the islanders, because of the gold and silver mines on the island. They were so wealthy that the treasure dedicated by them at , which is as rich as any there, was made from a tenth of their income; and they divided among themselves each year's income.\nNow when they were putting together the treasure they inquired of the oracle if their present prosperity was likely to last long; whereupon the priestess gave them this answer:\n\n\n\nAt this time the market-place and town-hall of  were adorned with  marble.\n\nThey could not understand this oracle either when it was spoken or at the time of the ' coming. As soon as the  put in at , they sent ambassadors to the town in one of their ships;\n\nnow in ancient times all ships were painted with vermilion; and this was what was meant by the warning given by the priestess to the , to beware a wooden force and a red herald.\nThe messengers, then, demanded from the  a loan of ten talents; when the  refused them, the  set about ravaging their lands.\nHearing this the  came out at once to drive them off, but they were defeated in battle, and many of them were cut off from their town by the ; who presently exacted from them a hundred talents.\n\n\nThen the  took from the men of , instead of money, the island  which is near to the , and gave it to men of  for safekeeping; they themselves settled at  in , though their voyage had been made with no such intent, but rather to drive  out of the island.\nHere they stayed and prospered for five years; indeed, the temples now at  and the shrine of  are the ' work;\n\nbut in the sixth year  and  came and defeated them in a sea-fight and made slaves of them; moreover they cut off the ships' prows, that were shaped like boars' heads, and dedicated them in the temple of  in .\nThe  did this out of a grudge against the ; for previously the , in the days when  was king of , sailing in force against , had hurt the  and been hurt by them. This was the cause.\n\n\nI have written at such length of the , because the three greatest works of all the  were engineered by them. The first of these is the tunnel with a mouth at either end driven through the base of a hill nine hundred feet high;\n\nthe whole tunnel is forty-two hundred feet long, eight feet high and eight feet wide; and throughout the whole of its length there runs a channel thirty feet deep and three feet wide, through which the water coming from an abundant spring is carried by pipes to the city of .\nThe designer of this work was  son of , a . This is one of the three works; the second is a breakwater in the sea enclosing the harbor, sunk one hundred and twenty feet, and more than twelve hundred feet in length.\nThe third  work is the temple, which is the greatest of all the temples of which we know; its first builder was  son of , a . It is for this cause that I have expounded at more than ordinary length of .\n\n\nNow after , son of , had lost his mind, while he was still in , two  brothers rebelled against him. One of them had been left by  as steward of his house; this man now revolted from him, perceiving that the death of  was kept secret, and that few knew of it, most believing him to be still alive.\nTherefore he plotted to gain the royal power: he had a brother, his partner, as I said, in rebellion; this brother was in appearance very like ' son , whom , his brother, had killed; nor was he like him in appearance only, but he bore the same name too, .\n\n the  persuaded this man that he would manage everything for him; he brought his brother and set him on the royal throne; then he sent heralds to all parts, one of whom was to go to  and proclaim to the army that henceforth they must obey not  but , the son of .\n\n\nSo this proclamation was made everywhere. The herald appointed to go to , finding  and his army at  in , came out before them all and proclaimed the message given him by the .\nWhen  heard what the herald said, he supposed that it was the truth, and that , when sent to kill , had not done it but had played  false; and he said, fixing his eyes on , Is it thus, , that you carried out my instructions?\n\nNo, said , this is not true, sire, that your brother  has rebelled against you; he cannot have any quarrel with you, small or great; I myself did as you instructed, and I buried him with my own hands.\nIf then the dead can rise, you may expect to see  the  rise up against you; but if things are as usual, assuredly no harm to you will arise from . Now then this is my opinion, that we pursue this herald and interrogate him, to learn from whom he comes with his proclamation that we must obey  as our king.\n\n\n liked ' advice; the herald was pursued at once and brought; and when he came,  put this question to him: Fellow, you say that your message is from ' son ; tell me this now, and you may go away unpunished: was it  who appeared to you and gave you this charge, or was it one of his servants?\n\nSince  marched to , answered the herald, I have never seen  the son of ; the  whom  made overseer of his house gave me the message, saying that it was the will of , son of , that I should make it known to you.\nSo spoke the herald, telling the whole truth; and  said, , having done what you were told like a good man you are free of blame; but who can this  be who rebels against me and usurps the name of ?\n\n replied, I think, sire, that I understand what has been done here; the rebels are the ,  whom you left steward of your house, and his brother .\n\n\nThe truth of the words and of a dream struck  the moment he heard the name ; for he had dreamt that a message had come to him that  sitting on the royal throne touched heaven with his head;\n\nand perceiving that he had killed his brother without cause, he wept bitterly for . Having wept, and grieved by all his misfortune, he sprang upon his horse, with intent to march at once to  against the .\nAs he sprang upon his horse, the cap fell off the sheath of his sword, and the naked blade pierced his thigh, wounding him in the same place where he had once wounded the  god ; and believing the wound to be mortal,  asked what was the name of the town where he was.\nThey told him it was . Now a prophecy had before this come to him from , that he would end his life at ;  supposed this to signify that he would die in old age at the Median , his capital city; but as the event proved, the oracle prophesied his death at  of .\nSo when he now inquired and learned the name of the town, the shock of his wound, and of the misfortune that came to him from the , brought him to his senses; he understood the prophecy and said: Here  son of  is to die.\n\n\nAt this time he said no more. But about twenty days later, he sent for the most prominent of the  that were about him, and thus addressed them: , I have to make known to you something which I kept most strictly concealed.\nWhen I was in  I had a dream, which I wish I had not had; it seemed to me that a messenger came from home to tell me that  sitting on the royal throne touched heaven with his head.\nThen I feared that my brother would take away my sovereignty from me, and I acted with more haste than wisdom; for it is not in the power of human nature to run away from what is to be; but I, blind as I was, sent  to  to kill . When that great wrong was done I lived without fear, for I never thought that when  was removed another man might rise against me.\nBut I mistook altogether what was to be; I have killed my brother when there was no need, and I have lost my kingdom none the less; for it was the   that the divinity forewarned in the dream would revolt.\nNow he has been done for by me, and I would have you believe that  ' son no longer lives; the  rule the kingdom, the one that I left caretaker of my house, and his brother . So then, the man is dead of an unholy destiny at the hands of his relations who ought to have been my avenger for the disgrace I have suffered from the ;\n\nand as he is no longer alive, necessity constrains me to charge you, men of , in his place, with the last desire of my life. In the name of the gods of my royal house I charge all of you, but chiefly those  that are here, not to let the sovereignty fall again into Median hands; if they have it after getting it by trickery, take it back through trickery of your own; if they have got it away by force, then by force all the stronger get it back.\nAnd if you do this, may your land bring forth fruit, and your women and your flocks and herds be blessed with offspring, remaining free for all time; but if you do not get the kingdom back or attempt to get it back, then I pray things turn out the opposite for you, and on top of this, that every  meet an end such as mine. With that  wept bitterly for all that had happened to him.\n\n\nWhen the  saw their king weep, they all tore the clothing which they wore and wailed loud and long.\nBut when after this the bone rotted and the thigh rapidly putrefied, it carried off  son of , who had reigned in all seven years and five months, but was altogether childless, without male or female issue.\nTo the  who were present it was quite incredible that the  were masters of the kingdom; they believed that ' intent was to deceive them with his story of ' death, so that all  might be embroiled in a war against him.\n\n\nSo they believed that it was ' son  who had been made king. For  stoutly denied that he had killed , since now that  was dead, it was not safe for him to say that he had slain the son of  with his own hands.\n\n being dead, the , pretending to be the  of like name, ' son, reigned without fear for the seven months by which  had fallen short of reigning eight years.\nIn this time he benefitted all his subjects to such an extent that after his death all the  except the  wished him back; for he sent to every nation he ruled and proclaimed an exemption for three years from military service and from tribute.\n\n\nSuch was his proclamation at the beginning of his reign; but in the eighth month he was exposed in the following manner. There was one , son of , as well-born and rich a man as any .\nThis  was the first to guess that the  was not ' son  and who, in fact, he was; the reason was, that he never left the acropolis nor summoned any notable  into his presence. And having formed this suspicion  did as follows:\n\n had taken his daughter, whose name was ; this same girl the  had now and he lived with her and with all ' other wives.  sent to this daughter, asking at what man's side she lay, with , ' son, or with some other?\nShe sent back a message that she did not know; for (she said) she had never seen ' son , nor did she know who her bedfellow was. Then  sent a second message, to this effect: If you do not know ' son  yourself, then find out from  who it is that she and you are living with; for surely she knows her own brother.\nTo this his daughter replied: I cannot communicate with , nor can I see any other of the women of the household; for no sooner had this man, whoever he is, made himself king, than he sent us to live apart, each in her own appointed place.\n\n\nWhen  heard that, he saw more clearly how the matter stood; and he sent her this third message:\n\nDaughter, your noble birth obliges you to run any risk that your father commands you to face. If this man is not  son of  but who I think he is, then he must not get away with sleeping with you and sitting on the throne of , but be punished.\nNow, then, when he lies with you and you see that he is sleeping, feel his ears; if he has ears, rest assured that you are living with  son of ; but if he has none, it is  the .\n\n answered by messenger that she would run a very great risk by so doing; for if it should turn out that he had no ears, and she were caught feeling for them, he would surely kill her; nevertheless she would do it.\nSo she promised to do this for her father.  son of  during his reign cut off the ears of this   for some grave reason.\nSo , daughter of , performed her promise to her father. When it was her turn to go to the  (for their wives go in sequence to the ), she came to his bed and felt for the ' ears while he slumbered deeply; and having with no great difficulty assured herself that he had no ears, she sent and told this to her father as soon as it was morning.\n\n\n then took aside two  of the highest rank whom he thought worthiest of trust,  and , and told them the whole story. These, it would seem, had themselves suspected that it was so; and now they readily believed what  revealed to them.\nThey resolved that each should take into his confidence that  whom he most trusted;  brought in ,  brought , and  .\nWhen they were six, , whose father, , was a subordinate governor of the , arrived at . When he came, then, the six  resolved to include  too.\n\n\nThe seven then met and gave each other tokens of good faith and spoke together; and when it was ' turn to declare his mind, he spoke as follows:\n\nI thought that I alone knew that it was the  who was king and that  son of  was dead; and it was for this reason that I made haste to come, that I might effect the ' death; but since it turns out that you know too and not only I, I think that we should act at once and not put it off.\n\n replied, son of , you have a good father and seem likely yourself to be in no way inferior to your father; do not hurry this undertaking without thinking, but take it up more prudently; there must be more of us to try it.\nTo this  answered: You gentlemen who are here, if you do as  says, know that you will die horribly; for someone will inform the , looking to enrich himself alone.\nYou ought to have done it by yourselves; but since you decided to confide in others and have included me, let us either act today or else understand that if the present day passes, nobody else will betray you before I do, for I shall myself betray you to the .\n\nTo this  replied, seeing ' vehemence, Since you force us to hurry and will tolerate no delay, tell us now yourself how we shall pass into the palace and attack them. For you know yourself, I suppose, if not because you have seen them then you have heard, that guards are stationed all around; how shall we go past the guards?\n\n, answered , there are many things that cannot be described in words, but in deed; and there are other things that can be described in words, but nothing illustrious comes of them. You know well that the guards who are set are easy to go by.\nThere is no one who will not allow us to pass, from respect or from fear, because of who we are; and further, I have myself the best pretext for entering, for I shall say that I have just arrived from  and have a message for the king from my father.\nWhen it is necessary to lie, lie. For we want the same thing, liars and those who tell the truth; some lie to win credence and advantage by lies, while others tell the truth in order to obtain some advantage by the truth and to be more trusted; thus we approach the same ends by different means.\nIf the hope of advantage were taken away, the truth-teller would be as ready to lie as the liar to tell the truth. Now if any of the watchmen willingly let us pass, it will be better for him later. But if any tries to withstand us, let us note him as an enemy, and so thrust ourselves in and begin our work.\n\n\nThen  said, Friends, when shall we have a better chance to win back the kingship, or, if we cannot, to die, since we who are  are ruled by a , a , and he a man that has no ears?\nThose of you that were with  at his death-bed of course remember the curse which he pronounced as he died on the  if they should not try to get back the kingship, although we did not believe  then, but thought that he spoke to deceive us.\nNow therefore my vote is that we follow ' plan, and not quit this council to do anything else but attack the  at once. So spoke ; and they all consented to what he said.\n\n\nWhile they were making these plans, by coincidence the following happened. The  had resolved after consideration to make a friend of , because he had been wronged by  (who had killed his son with an arrow) and because he alone knew of the death of ' son , having himself been the slayer; but besides this, because he was in great repute among the .\nFor these reasons they summoned him and tried to make him a friend, having bound him by tokens of good faith and oaths to keep to himself and betray to no one their deception of the , and promising to give him all things in great abundance.\nWhen  agreed to do this, since the  importuned him, the  made this second proposal to him, that they should call an assembly of all the  before the palace wall, and he should go up on to a tower and declare that it was  son of  and no other who was king of .\nThey gave him this charge, because they thought him to be the man most trusted by the , and because he had often asserted that ' son  was alive, and had denied the murder.\n\n\nWhen  said that he was ready to do this too, the  summoned the  together, and brought him up on to a tower and bade him speak. Then, deliberately forgetting all the 's instructions, he traced the lineage of  from  downwards; when he came at last to the name of , he recounted all the good which that king had done to ,\n\nand after he had narrated this, he revealed the truth, saying that he had concealed it before, as it had not been safe for him to tell what had happened, but at the present time necessity forced him to reveal it: and he said that he himself, forced by , had killed  son of , and that the  were in power.\nThen, invoking a terrible curse on the  if they did not win back the throne and take vengeance on the , he threw himself headlong down from the tower; so , a man who was always well thought of, perished in this way.\n\n\nThe seven , when they had decided to attack the  at once and not delay, prayed to the gods and set forth, knowing nothing of what had happened to .\nBut when they had gone half way they learned what had happened to . Then they argued there, standing beside the road, ' party demanding that they delay and not attack while events were in flux, and ' party that they go directly and do what they had decided and not put it off.\nWhile they were arguing, they saw seven pairs of hawks chase and slash and tear to bits two pairs of vultures. And seeing this all seven consented to ' opinion, and went on to the palace, encouraged by the birds.\n\n\nWhen they came to the gate, it turned out as  had expected; the guards, out of respect for the leading men in  and never suspecting that there would be trouble from them, allowed them to pass, who enjoyed divine guidance, and no one asked any questions.\nAnd when they came to the court, they met the eunuchs that carry messages, who asked the seven why they had come; and while they were questioning these, they were threatening the watchmen for letting them pass, and restraining the seven who wanted to go on.\nThese gave each other the word, drew their knives, and stabbing the eunuchs who barred their way, went forward at a run to the men's apartment.\n\n\nBoth the  were within, deliberating about the consequences of ' act. Seeing the eunuchs in confusion and hearing their cries they both sprang up: and when they realized what was happening they turned to defending themselves.\nOne rushed to take down a bow, the other went for a spear. Then the fighting started. The one that had caught up the bow found it was no use to him, as the antagonists were close and jostling one another; but the other defended himself with his spear, wounding  in the thigh and  in the eye;  lost his eye from the wound but was not killed.\nSo one of the  wounded these; the other, as the bow was no use to him, fled into a chamber adjoining the men's apartment and would have shut its door.\nTwo of the seven flung into the room with him,  and ; as  and the  wrestled together,  stood helpless in the darkness, afraid of stabbing .\n\n, seeing  stand helpless, asked why he did not lend a hand; and he said, Because I am afraid for you, that I might stab you. And  answered, Stick your sword even if it goes through us both. So  complying stabbed with his knife and somehow stuck the .\n\n\nWhen they had killed the  and cut off their heads, they left their wounded there because of their infirmity and for the sake of guarding the acropolis, while five of them carrying the 's heads ran outside with much shouting and commotion, calling all  to aid, telling what they had done and showing the heads; at the same time they killed every  that came in their way.\nThe , when they learned what had been done by the seven and how the  had tricked them, resolved to follow the example set, and drew their daggers and killed all the  they could find; and if nightfall had not stopped them they would not have left one  alive.\nThis day is the greatest holy day that all  alike keep; they celebrate a great festival on it, which they call the Massacre of the ; while the festival lasts no  may go outdoors, but during this day the  remain in their houses.\n\n\nAfter the tumult quieted down, and five days passed, the rebels against the  held a council on the whole state of affairs, at which sentiments were uttered which to some  seem incredible, but there is no doubt that they were spoken.\n\n was for turning the government over to the  people: It seems to me, he said, that there can no longer be a single sovereign over us, for that is not pleasant or good. You saw the insolence of , how far it went, and you had your share of the insolence of the .\nHow can monarchy be a fit thing, when the ruler can do what he wants with impunity? Give this power to the best man on earth, and it would stir him to unaccustomed thoughts. Insolence is created in him by the good things to hand, while from birth envy is rooted in man.\nAcquiring the two he possesses complete evil; for being satiated he does many reckless things, some from insolence, some from envy. And yet an absolute ruler ought to be free of envy, having all good things; but he becomes the opposite of this towards his citizens; he envies the best who thrive and live, and is pleased by the worst of his fellows; and he is the best confidant of slander.\nOf all men he is the most inconsistent; for if you admire him modestly he is angry that you do not give him excessive attention, but if one gives him excessive attention he is angry because one is a flatter. But I have yet worse to say of him than that; he upsets the ancestral ways and rapes women and kills indiscriminately.\nBut the rule of the multitude has in the first place the loveliest name of all, equality, and does in the second place none of the things that a monarch does. It determines offices by lot, and holds power accountable, and conducts all deliberating publicly. Therefore I give my opinion that we make an end of monarchy and exalt the multitude, for all things are possible for the majority.\n\n\nSuch was the judgment of : but  urged that they resort to an oligarchy. I agree, said he, with all that  says against the rule of one; but when he tells you to give the power to the multitude, his judgment strays from the best. Nothing is more foolish and violent than a useless mob;\n\nfor men fleeing the insolence of a tyrant to fall victim to the insolence of the unguided populace is by no means to be tolerated. Whatever the one does, he does with knowledge, but for the other knowledge is impossible; how can they have knowledge who have not learned or seen for themselves what is best, but always rush headlong and drive blindly onward, like a river in flood?\nLet those like democracy who wish ill to ; but let us choose a group of the best men and invest these with the power. For we ourselves shall be among them, and among the best men it is likely that there will be the best counsels.\n\n\nSuch was the judgment of .  was the third to express his opinion. It seems to me, he said, that  speaks well concerning democracy but not concerning oligarchy. For if the three are proposed and all are at their best for the sake of argument, the best democracy and oligarchy and monarchy, I hold that monarchy is by far the most excellent.\nOne could describe nothing better than the rule of the one best man; using the best judgment, he will govern the multitude with perfect wisdom, and best conceal plans made for the defeat of enemies.\nBut in an oligarchy, the desire of many to do the state good service often produces bitter hate among them; for because each one wishes to be first and to make his opinions prevail, violent hate is the outcome, from which comes faction and from faction killing, and from killing it reverts to monarchy, and by this is shown how much better monarchy is.\nThen again, when the people rule it is impossible that wickedness will not occur; and when wickedness towards the state occurs, hatred does not result among the wicked, but strong alliances; for those that want to do the state harm conspire to do it together. This goes on until one of the people rises to stop such men. He therefore becomes the people's idol, and being their idol is made their monarch; and thus he also proves that monarchy is best.\nBut (to conclude the whole matter in one word) tell me, where did freedom come from for us and who gave it, from the people or an oligarchy or a single ruler? I believe, therefore, that we who were liberated through one man should maintain such a government, and, besides this, that we should not alter our ancestral ways that are good; that would not be better.\n\n\nHaving to choose between these three options, four of the seven men preferred the last. Then , whose proposal to give the  equality was defeated, spoke thus among them all:\n\nFellow partisans, it is plain that one of us must be made king (whether by lot, or entrusted with the office by the choice of the , or in some other way), but I shall not compete with you; I desire neither to rule nor to be ruled; but if I waive my claim to be king, I make this condition, that neither I nor any of my descendants shall be subject to any one of you.\nTo these terms the six others agreed;  took no part in the contest but stood aside; and to this day his house (and no other in ) remains free, and is ruled only so far as it is willing to be, so long as it does not transgress  law.\n\n\nThe rest of the seven then considered what was the fairest way of making a king; and they decided that if another of the seven than  should gain the royal power, that  and his descendants should receive a yearly gift of Median clothing and everything else that the  hold most valuable. The reason for this decision was that it was he who had first planned the matter and assembled the conspirators.\nFor , then, they choose this particular honor; but with regard to all of them they decreed that any one of the seven should, if he wished, enter the king's palace unannounced, except when the king was sleeping with a woman; and that the king should be forbidden to take a wife except from the households of the conspirators.\nAs for the making of a king, they decided that he should be elected whose horse, after they were all in their saddles in the suburb of the city, should first be heard to neigh at sunrise.\n\n\nNow  had a clever groom, whose name was . When the council broke up,  said to him: , we have resolved to do as follows about the kingship: he shall be elected whose horse, after we are all mounted on our horses in the suburb of the city, neighs first at sunrise. Now if you have any cunning, figure out how we and no one else can win this prize.\n\nMaster,  answered, if this is to determine whether you become king or not, be confident for this reason and have an easy mind, for no one else shall be king before you, such are the tricks I have. Then, said , if you have any trick such as you say, use it and don't put it off, for tomorrow is the day of decision.\nWhen  heard that, he did as follows. At nightfall he brought one of the mares which ' horse particularly favored, and tethered her in the suburb of the city; then bringing ' horse, he repeatedly led him near the horse, bumping against the mare, and at last let the horse mount.\n\n\nAt dawn of day the six came on horseback as they had agreed. As they rode out through the suburb and came to the place where the mare had been tethered in the past night, ' horse trotted forward and whinnied;\n\nand as he so did there came lightning and thunder out of a clear sky. These signs given to  were thought to be foreordained and made his election perfect; his companions leapt from their horses and bowed to him.\n\n\nSome say that this was ' plan; but there is another story in  besides this: that he rubbed this mare's vulva with his hand, which he then kept inside his clothing until the six were about to let go their horses at sunrise, when he took his hand out and held it to the nostrils of ' horse, which at once snorted and whinnied.\n\n\nSo  son of  was made king, and the whole of , which  first and  after him had conquered, was subject to him, except the ; these did not yield as of slaves to the , but were united to them by friendship, having given  passage into , which the  could not enter without the consent of the .\n\n took wives from the noblest houses of , marrying ' daughters  and ;  had been a wife of her brother  and afterwards of the ;  was a virgin.\nHe also married a daughter of ' son , whose name was , and the daughter of  who had discovered the truth about the ; and everything was full of his power. First he made and set up a carved stone, upon which was cut the figure of a horseman, with this inscription:  son of , aided by the excellence of his horse (here followed the horse's name) and of  his groom, got possession of the kingdom of .\n\n\nHaving done these things in , he divided his dominions into twenty provinces, which they call satrapies; and having divided his dominions and appointed governors, he instructed each people to pay him tribute, consolidating neighboring peoples and distributing outlying peoples among different provinces, passing over those adjoining.\nI will now show how he divided his provinces and the tributes which were paid him yearly. Those that paid in silver were required to render the weight of a  talent; those that paid in gold, of a  talent; the  talent being equal to seventy-eight  minae.\nIn the reigns of  and  after him there was no fixed tribute, but payment was made in gifts. It is because of this fixing of tribute, and other similar ordinances, that the  called  the merchant,  the master, and  the father; for  made petty profit out of everything,  was harsh and arrogant,  was merciful and always worked for their well-being.\n\n\nThe ,  of , , , , , and , on whom  laid one joint tribute, paid a revenue of four hundred talents of silver. This was established as his first province. The , , , , and  paid five hundred talents; this was the second province.\nThe third comprised the  on the right of the entrance of the straits, the ,  of , , , and ; these paid three hundred and sixty talents of tribute.\nThe fourth province was . This rendered three hundred and sixty white horses, one for each day in the year, and five hundred talents of silver. A hundred and forty of these were expended on the horsemen who were the guard of ; the three hundred and sixty that remained were paid to .\n\n\nThe fifth province was the country (except the part belonging to the , which paid no tribute) between , a city founded on the  and  border by  son of , and ; this paid three hundred and fifty talents; in this province was all , and the part of  called , and .\nThe sixth province was  and the neighboring parts of , and  and , all of which were included in the province of . From here came seven hundred talents, besides the income in silver from the fish of the ;\n\nbesides that silver and the assessment of grain that was given also, seven hundred talents were paid; for a hundred and twenty thousand bushels of grain were also assigned to the  quartered at the  of  and their allies.\nThe , , , and  paid together a hundred and seventy talents; this was the seventh province; the eighth was  and the rest of the  country, paying three hundred talents.\n\n\nFrom  and the rest of  came to  a thousand talents of silver and five hundred castrated boys; this was the ninth province;  and the rest of Media, with the  and , paid four hundred and fifty talents, and was the tenth province.\nThe eleventh comprised the , , , and , paying jointly two hundred;\n\n\nThe twelfth, the  as far as the land of the ; these paid three hundred and sixty. The thirteenth, the  country and  and the lands adjoining as far as the ; these paid four hundred.\nThe fourteenth province was made up of the , , , , , and the inhabitants of those islands of the southern sea on which the king settles the so-called displaced people; these together paid a tribute of six hundred talents.\nThe  and  were the fifteenth, paying two hundred and fifty. The , , , and  were the sixteenth, paying three hundred.\n\n\nThe  and  of , the seventeenth, paid four hundred; the , , and  were the eighteenth, and two hundred talents were the appointed tribute.\nThe , , , , and Mares, the nineteenth province, were ordered to pay three hundred. The  made up the twentieth province. These are more in number than any nation of which we know, and they paid a greater tribute than any other province, namely three hundred and sixty talents of gold dust.\n\n\nNow if these  silver talents be calculated in  money, the sum is seen to be nine thousand eight hundred and eighty  talents:\n\nand the gold coin being thirteen times the value of the silver, the gold-dust is found to be worth four thousand six hundred and eighty  talents. Therefore it is seen by adding all together that  collected a yearly tribute of fourteen thousand five hundred and sixty talents; I take no account of figures less than ten.\n\n\nThis was ' revenue from  and a few parts of . But as time went on he drew tribute also from the islands and the dwellers in , as far as .\nThe tribute is stored by the king in this fashion: he melts it down and pours it into earthen vessels; when the vessel is full he breaks the earthenware away, and when he needs money coins as much as serves his purpose.\n\n\nThese were the governments and appointments of tribute. The  country is the only one which I have not recorded as tributary; for the  live free from all taxes.\nAs for those on whom no tribute was laid, but who rendered gifts instead, they were, firstly, the  nearest to , whom  conquered in his march towards the long-lived ; and also those who dwell about the holy , where  is the god of their festivals. These  and their neighbors use the same seed as the , and they live underground.\nThese together brought every other year and still bring a gift of two choenixes of unrefined gold, two hundred blocks of ebony, five  boys, and twenty great elephants' tusks.\nGifts were also required of the  and their neighbors as far as the  (which is as far as the  rule reaches, the country north of the  paying no regard to the ); these were rendered every four years and are still rendered, namely, a hundred boys and as many maids.\nThe  rendered a thousand talents' weight of frankincense yearly. Such were the gifts of these peoples to the king, besides the tribute.\n\n\nAll this abundance of gold, from which the  send the aforementioned gold-dust to the king, they obtain in the following way.\nTo the east of the  country is sand. Of all the people of  whom we know - even those about whom something is said with precision - the  dwell nearest to the dawn and the rising sun; for on the eastern side of  all is desolate because of the sand.\nThere are many  nations, none speaking the same language; some of them are nomads, some not; some dwell in the river marshes and live on raw fish, which they catch from reed boats. Each boat is made of one joint of reed.\nThese  wear clothes of bullrushes; they mow and cut these from the river, then weave them crosswise like a mat, and wear them like a breastplate.\n\n\nOther , to the east of these, are nomads and eat raw flesh; they are called . It is said to be their custom that when anyone of their fellows, whether man or woman, is sick, a man's closest friends kill him, saying that if wasted by disease he will be lost to them as meat; though he denies that he is sick, they will not believe him, but kill and eat him.\nWhen a woman is sick, she is put to death like the men by the women who are her close acquaintances. As for one that has come to old age, they sacrifice him and feast on his flesh; but not many reach this reckoning, for before that everyone who falls ill they kill.\n\n\nThere are other , again, who kill no living creature, nor plant anything, nor are accustomed to have houses; they eat grass, and they have a grain growing naturally from the earth in its husk, about the size of a millet-seed, which they gather with the husk and boil and eat. When any one of them falls sick, he goes into the desert and lies there, and no one notices whether he is sick or dies.\n\n\nThese  whom I have described have intercourse openly like cattle; they are all black-skinned, like the .\nTheir semen too, which they ejaculate into the women, is not white like other men's, but black like their skin, and resembles in this respect that of the . These  dwell far away from the  southwards, and were not subjects of .\n\n\nOther  dwell near the town of  and the  country, north of the rest of ; these live like the ; they are of all  the most warlike, and it is they who are sent for the gold; for in these parts all is desolate because of the sand.\nIn this sandy desert are ants, not as big as dogs but bigger than foxes; the  king has some of these, which have been caught there. These ants live underground, digging out the sand in the same way as the ants in , to which they are very similar in shape, and the sand which they carry from the holes is full of gold.\nIt is for this sand that the  set forth into the desert. They harness three camels apiece, males on either side sharing the drawing, and a female in the middle: the man himself rides on the female, that when harnessed has been taken away from as young an offspring as may be. Their camels are as swift as horses, and much better able to bear burdens besides.\n\n\nI do not describe the camel's appearance to , for they know it; but I shall tell them something that they do not know concerning it: the hindlegs of the camel have four thighbones and four knee-joints; its genitals are turned towards the tail between the hindlegs.\n\n\nThus and with teams so harnessed the  ride after the gold, being careful to be engaged in taking it when the heat is greatest; for the ants are then out of sight underground.\nNow in these parts the sun is hottest in the morning, not at midday as elsewhere, but from sunrise to the hour of market-closing. Through these hours it is much hotter than in  at noon, so that men are said to sprinkle themselves with water at this time.\nAt midday the sun's heat is nearly the same in  as elsewhere. As it goes to afternoon, the sun of  has the power of the morning sun in other lands; as day declines it becomes ever cooler, until at sunset it is exceedingly cold.\n\n\nSo when the  come to the place with their sacks, they fill these with the sand and drive back as fast as possible; for the ants at once scent them out, the  say, and give chase. They say nothing is equal to them for speed, so that unless the  have a headstart while the ants were gathering, not one of them would get away.\nThey cut loose the male trace-camels, which are slower than the females, as they begin to lag, one at a time; the mares never tire, for they remember the young that they have left. Such is the tale. Most of the gold (say the ) is got in this way by the ; they dig some from mines in their country, too, but it is less abundant.\n\n\nThe most outlying nations of the world have somehow drawn the finest things as their lot, exactly as  has drawn the possession of far the best seasons.\nAs I have lately said,  lies at the world's most distant eastern limit; and in  all living creatures four-footed and flying are much bigger than those of other lands, except the horses, which are smaller than the Median horses called ; moreover, the gold there, whether dug from the earth or brought down by rivers or got as I have described, is very abundant.\nThere, too, wool more beautiful and excellent than the wool of sheep grows on wild trees; these trees supply the  with clothing.\n\n\nAgain,  is the most distant to the south of all inhabited countries: and this is the only country which produces frankincense and myrrh and casia and cinnamon and gum-mastich. All these except myrrh are difficult for the  to get.\nThey gather frankincense by burning that storax which  carry to ; they burn this and so get the frankincense; for the spice-bearing trees are guarded by small winged snakes of varied color, many around each tree; these are the snakes that attack . Nothing except the smoke of storax will drive them away from the trees.\n\n\nThe  also say that the whole country would be full of these snakes if the same thing did not occur among them that I believe occurs among vipers.\nSomehow the forethought of God (just as is reasonable) being wise has made all creatures prolific that are timid and edible, so that they do not become extinct through being eaten, whereas few young are born to hardy and vexatious creatures.\nOn the one hand, because the hare is hunted by every beast and bird and man, therefore it is quite prolific; alone of all creatures it conceives during pregnancy; some of the unborn young are hairy, some still naked, some are still forming in the womb while others are just conceived.\nOn the one hand there is this sort of thing, but on the other hand the lioness, that is so powerful and so bold, once in her life bears one cub; for in the act of bearing she casts her uterus out with her cub. The explanation of this is that when the cub first begins to stir in the mother, its claws, much sharper than those of any other creature, tear the uterus, and the more it grows the more it scratches and tears, so that when the hour of birth is near seldom is any of the uterus left intact.\n\n\nSo too if the vipers and the winged serpents of  were born in the natural manner of serpents life would be impossible for men; but as it is, when they copulate, while the male is in the act of procreation and as soon as he has ejaculated his seed, the female seizes him by the neck, and does not let go until she has bitten through.\nThe male dies in the way described, but the female suffers in return for the male the following punishment: avenging their father, the young while they are still within the womb gnaw at their mother and eating through her bowels thus make their way out.\nOther snakes, that do no harm to men, lay eggs and hatch out a vast number of young. The  winged serpents do indeed seem to be numerous; but that is because (although there are vipers in every land) these are all in  and are found nowhere else.\n\n\nThe  get frankincense in the foregoing way, and casia in the following way: when they go after it they bind oxhides and other skins all over their bodies and faces except for the eyes. Casia grows in a shallow lake; around this and in it live winged creatures, very like bats, that squeak similarly and make a fierce resistance; these have to be kept away from the eyes in order to take the casia.\n\n\nAs for cinnamon, they gather it in an even stranger way. Where it comes from and what land produces it they cannot say, except that it is reported, reasonably enough, to grow in the places where  was reared.\nThere are great birds, it is said, that take these dry sticks which we have learned from the  to call cinnamon and carry them off to nests stuck with mud to precipitous cliffs, where man has no means of approach.\nThe  solution to this is to cut dead oxen and asses and other beasts of burden into the largest possible pieces, then to set these near the eyries and withdraw far off. The birds then fly down (it is said) and carry the pieces of the beasts up to their nests, while these, not being able to bear the weight, break and fall down the mountain side, and then the  come and gather them up. Thus is cinnamon said to be gathered, and so to come from  to other lands.\n\n\nBut ledanon, which the  call ladanon, is produced yet more strangely than this. For it is the most fragrant thing produced in the most malodorous; for it is found in he-goats' beards, forming in them like gum among timber. This is used in the manufacture of many perfumes; there is nothing that the  burn so often as incense.\n\n\nEnough of marvels, and yet the land of  gives off a scent as sweet as if divine. They have besides two marvellous kinds of sheep, found nowhere else. One of these has tails no less than nine feet long. Were the sheep to trail these after them they would suffer by the chafing of the tails on the ground;\n\nbut every shepherd there knows enough of carpentry to make little carts which they fix under the tails, binding the tail of each sheep on its own cart. The other kind of sheep has a tail a full three feet broad.\n\n\nWhere south inclines westwards, the part of the world stretching farthest towards the sunset is ; this produces gold in abundance, and huge elephants, and all sorts of wild trees, and ebony, and the tallest and handsomest and longest-lived people.\n\n\nThese then are the most distant lands in  and . But concerning those in  that are the farthest away towards evening, I cannot speak with assurance; for I do not believe that there is a river called by foreigners  issuing into the northern sea, where our amber is said to come from, nor do I have any knowledge of , where our tin is brought from.\nThe very name  betrays itself as not a foreign but a  name, invented by some poet; nor for all my diligence have I been able to learn from one who has seen it that there is a sea beyond . All we know is that our tin and amber come from the most distant parts.\n\n\nBut in the north of  there is by far the most gold. In this matter again I cannot say with assurance how the gold is produced, but it is said that one-eyed men called  steal it from griffins.\nBut I do not believe this, that there are one-eyed men who have a nature otherwise the same as other men.\nThe most outlying lands, though, as they enclose and wholly surround all the rest of the world, are likely to have those things which we think the finest and the rarest.\n\n\nThere is a plain in  shut in on all sides by mountains through which there are five passes. This plain was once the ', being at the boundaries of the , the , , , and , but since the  have held power it has been the king's.\nNow from the encircling mountains flows a great river whose name is the Aces. Its stream divides into five channels and formerly watered the lands of the above-mentioned peoples, going to each through a different pass, but since the beginning of the  rule\n\nthe king has blocked the mountain passes, and closed each passage with a gate; with the water barred from outlet, the plain within the mountains becomes a lake, seeing that the river pours into it and finds no way out.\nThose therefore who before were accustomed to use the water endure great hardship in not being able to use it; for during the winter, god rains for them just as for the rest of mankind, but in the summer they are in need of the water for their sown millet and sesame.\nSo whenever no water is given to them, they come into  with their women, and cry and howl before the door of the king's palace, until the king commands that the river-gate should be opened for those whose need is greatest;\n\nthen, when this land has drunk its fill of water, that gate is shut, and the king has another opened for those of the rest who most require it. I know by hearsay that he gets a lot of money, over and above the tribute, for opening the gates. So much for these matters.\n\n\nOf the seven men who revolted against the , one, , got his death through his own violence immediately after the rebellion. He wanted to enter the palace and speak with the king; and in fact the law was, that the rebels against the  could come into the king's presence unannounced, if the king were not having intercourse with one of his wives.\n\n, as one of the seven, claimed his right to enter unannounced; but the gatekeeper and the messenger forbade him, telling him that the king was having intercourse with one of his wives.  thought that they were lying; drawing his scimitar he cut off their noses and ears, then strung these on his horse's bridle and hung it around the men's necks, and so let them go.\n\n\nThey showed themselves to the king and told him why they had been treated so. , fearing that the six had done this by common consent, sent for each and asked his opinion, whether they approved what had been done;\n\nand being assured that they had no part in it, he seized  with his sons and all his householdfor he strongly suspected that the man was plotting a rebellion with his kinsmenand imprisoned them with the intention of putting them to death.\nThen ' wife began coming to the palace gates, weeping and lamenting; and by continuing to do this same thing she persuaded  to pity her; and he sent a messenger to tell her, Woman,  will allow one of your imprisoned relatives to survive, whomever you prefer of them all.\nAfter considering she answered, If indeed the king gives me the life of one, I chose from them all my brother.\n\n was astonished when he heard her answer, and sent someone who asked her: Woman, the king asks you with what in mind you abandon your husband and your children and choose to save the life of your brother, who is less close to you than your children and less dear than your husband?\n\nO King, she answered, I may have another husband, if a god is willing, and other children, if I lose these; but since my father and mother are no longer living, there is no way that I can have another brother; I said what I did with that in mind.\n\n thought that the woman answered well, and for her sake he released the one for whom she had asked, and the eldest of her sons as well; he put to death all the rest. Thus immediately perished one of the seven.\n\n\nWhile  was still ill, the following events occurred. The governor of  appointed by  was , a . This man had an impious desire; for although he had not been injured or spoken badly of by  of , and had in fact never even seen him before, he desired to seize and kill him, for the following reason, most people say.\nAs  and another  whose name was , governor of the province at , sat at the king's doors, they fell from talking to quarreling; and as they compared their achievements  said to ,\n\nYou are not to be reckoned a man; the island of  lies close to your province, yet you have not added it to the king's dominionan island so easy to conquer that some native of it revolted against his rulers with fifteen hoplites, and is now lord of it.\nSome say that , angered by this reproach, did not so much desire to punish the source of it as to destroy  utterly, the occasion of the reproach.\n\n\nA few people, however, say that when  sent a herald to  with some request (it is not said what this was), the herald found  lying in the men's apartments, in the company of  of ;\n\nand, whether on purpose to show contempt for , or by mere chance, when ' herald entered and addressed him, , then lying with his face to the wall, never turned or answered him.\n\n\nThese are the two reasons alleged for ' death; believe whichever you like. But the consequence was that , then at  which is above the river , sent  son of , a , with a message to , having learned ' intention;\n\nfor  was the first of the  whom we know to aim at the mastery of the sea, leaving out of account  of  and any others who before him may have ruled the sea; of what may be called the human race  was the first, and he had great hope of ruling  and the Islands.\nLearning then that he had this intention,  sent him this message:  addresses  as follows: I find that you aim at great things, but that you have not sufficient money for your purpose. Do then as I direct, and you will succeed yourself and will save me.  aims at my death; of this I have clear intelligence.\nNow if you will transport me and my money, you may take some yourself and let me keep the rest; thus you shall have wealth enough to rule all . If you mistrust what I tell you about the money, send someone who is most trusted by you and I will prove it to him.\n\n\nHearing this,  was pleased and willing; and since he had a great desire for money he first sent one of his townsmen, , son of , to have a look; this man was his scribe; it was he who not long afterwards dedicated in the  all the splendid furnishings of the men's apartment in ' house.\nWhen  heard that an inspection was imminent, he filled eight chests with stones, leaving only a very shallow space at the top; then he laid gold on top of the stones, locked the chests, and kept them ready.  came and saw, and brought word back to his master.\n\n\n then prepared to visit , despite the strong dissuasion of his diviners and friends, and a vision seen by his daughter in a dream; she dreamt that she saw her father in the air overhead being washed by  and anointed by ;\n\nafter this vision she used all means to persuade him not to go on this journey to ; even as he went to his fifty-oared ship she prophesied evil for him. When  threatened her that if he came back safe, she would long remain unmarried, she answered with a prayer that his threat might be fulfilled: for she would rather, she said, long remain unmarried than lose her father.\n\n\nBut  would listen to no advice. He sailed to meet , with a great retinue of followers, among whom was , son of , a man of  and the most skillful physician of his time.\nBut no sooner had  come to  than he was horribly murdered in a way unworthy of him and of his aims; for, except for the sovereigns of , no sovereign of  race is fit to be compared with  for magnificence.\nHaving killed him in some way not fit to be told,  then crucified him; as for those who had accompanied him, he let the  go, telling them to thank him that they were free; those who were not , or were servants of ' followers, he kept for slaves.\nAnd  hanging in the air fulfilled his daughter's vision in every detail; for he was washed by  when it rained, and he was anointed by  as he exuded sweat from his body.\n\n\nThis was the end of ' string of successes as  king of  had forewarned him. But not long after, atonement for  overtook . After the death of  and the rule of the ,  stayed in , where he did not help the  in any way to regain the power taken from them by the ,\n\nbut, to the contrary, in this confusion killed two prominent , , the governor from , who had taunted him about , and ' son ; and on top of many other violent acts, he set an ambush down the road after a messenger from  came with a message which displeased him and killed that messenger on his homeward journey, and concealed the man's body and horse.\n\n\nSo when  became king, he wanted to punish  for all his wrongdoing, and especially for killing  and his son. But he thought it best not to send an army openly against the satrap, seeing that everything was still in confusion and he was still new to the royal power; moreover he heard that  was very powerful, having a guard of a thousand  spearmen and being governor of the  and  and  province.\nHe had recourse, then, to the following expedient: having summoned an assembly of the most prominent , he addressed them as follows: , which of you will promise to do this for me, not with force and numbers, but by cunning? Where there is need for cunning, force has no business.\nSo then, which of you would either bring me  alive or kill him? For he has done the  no good, but much harm; he has destroyed two of us,  and his son, and is killing my messengers that are sent to recall him, displaying an insolence that is not to be borne. So, then, before he does the  some still greater harm, he has to be punished by us with death.\n\n\n asked this and thirty men promised, each wanting to do it himself.  told them not argue but draw lots; they did, and the lot fell to , son of .\n\n, having drawn the lot, did as follows: he had many letters written concerning many things and put the seal of  on them, and then went with them to .\nWhen he got there and came into ' presence, he took out each letter in turn and gave it to one of the royal scribes to read (all of the governors of the King have scribes);  gave the letters to test the spearmen, whether they would consent to revolt against .\nSeeing that they were greatly affected by the rolls and yet more by what was written in them, he gave another, in which were these words: !  forbids you to be ' guard. Hearing this, they lowered their spears for him.\nWhen  saw that they obeyed the letter so far, he was encouraged and gave the last roll to the scribe, in which was written:  instructs the  in  to kill . Hearing this the spearmen drew their scimitars and killed him at once. Thus atonement for  the  overtook  the .\n\n\n' slaves and other possessions were brought to . Not long after this, it happened that  twisted his foot in dismounting from his horse while hunting\n\nso violently that the ball of the ankle joint was dislocated from its socket.  called in the best physicians of , whom he had until now kept near his person. But by violently twisting the foot they made the injury worse;\n\nand for seven days and nights the king could not sleep because of the pain. On the eighth day, when he was doing poorly, someone who had heard in  of the skill of  of  told  of him; and he told them to bring him as quickly as possible. When they found him among the slaves of , where he was forgotten, they brought him along, dragging his chains and dressed in rags.\n\n\n asked him when he was brought in if he were trained in medicine. He refused to admit it, for he was afraid that if he revealed himself he would be cut off from  for good.\nIt was clear to , however, that he was trained in deceit, and he ordered those who had brought him to bring along scourges and goads. Then he confessed, saying that his training was not exact, but that he had associated with a physician and had a passing acquaintance with medicine.\nBut when  turned the case over to him and  applied  remedies and used gentleness instead of the ' violence, he enabled him to sleep and in a short time had him well, although  had had no hope of regaining the use of his foot.\nAfter this,  rewarded him with a gift of two pairs of golden fetters. Is it your purpose,  asked, to double my pains for making you well? Pleased by the retort,  sent him to his own wives. The eunuchs who conducted him told the women that this was the man who had given the king his life back.\nEach of them took a bowl and dipped it in a chest full of gold, so richly rewarding  that the servant accompanying him, whose name was , collected a very great sum of gold by picking up the staters that fell from the bowls.\n\n\nNow this is how  had come from  to live with : he was oppressed by a harsh-tempered father at ; since he could not stand him, he left him and went to . Within the first year after settling there, he excelled the rest of the physicians, although he had no equipment nor any medical implements.\nIn his second year the  paid him a talent to be their public physician; in the third year the  hired him for a hundred minae, and  in the fourth year for two talents. Thus he came to , and not least because of this man the physicians of  were well-respected \n\nfor at this time the best physicians in  countries were those of , and next to them those of . About the same time the  had the name of being the best musicians.\n\n\nSo now because he had healed  at   had a very grand house and ate at the king's table; he had everything, except permission to return to the .\nWhen the  physicians who until now had attended the king were about to be impaled for being less skilful than a ,  interceded with the king for them and saved them; and he saved an  seer, too, who had been a retainer of ' and was forgotten among the slaves.  was a man of considerable influence with the King.\n\n\nA short time after this, something else occurred; there was a swelling on the breast of , the daughter of  and wife of , which broke and spread further. As long as it was small, she hid it out of shame and told no one; but when it got bad, she sent for  and showed it to him.\nHe said he would cure her, but made her swear that she would repay him by granting whatever he asked of her, and said that he would ask nothing shameful.\n\n\nAnd after he treated her and did cure her,  addressed  in their chamber as she had been instructed by : O King, although you have so much power you are idle, acquiring no additional people or power for the .\nThe right thing for a man who is both young and the master of great wealth is to be seen aggrandizing himself, so that the  know too that they are ruled by a man. On two counts it is in your interest to do this, both so that the  know that their leader is a man, and so that they be occupied by war and not have time to plot against you.\nYou should show some industry now, while you are still young: for sense grows with the growing body, but grows old too with the aging body and loses its edge for all purposes.\nShe said this as instructed, but he replied with this: Woman, what you have said is exactly what I had in mind to do. For I have planned to make a bridge from this continent to the other continent and lead an army against the ; and this will be done in a short time.\n\nLook,  said, let the  go for the present; you shall have them whenever you like; I tell you, march against . I have heard of  and  and Attic and  women, and would like to have them as servants. You have a man who is fitter than any other to instruct and guide you in everything concerning : I mean the physician who healed your foot.\n\n answered, Woman, since you think that we should make an attempt on  first, it seems to me to be best that we first send  spies with the man whom you mention, who shall tell us everything that they learn and observe; and then when I am fully informed I shall rouse myself against them.\n\n\nHe said this, and no sooner said than did it. For the next day at dawn he summoned fifteen prominent , and instructed them to go with  and sail along the coast of ; telling them, too, by all means to bring the physician back and not let him escape.\nHaving given these instructions to them, he then sent for , and asked of him that when he had shown and made clear all of  to the , he would come back; and he told him to take all his movable goods to give to his father and siblings, saying that he would give him many times as much in return and would send with him a ship with a cargo of all good things.\n\n, I think, made this promise without a treacherous intent, but  was afraid that  was testing him; therefore he was in no hurry to accept all that was offered, but answered that he would leave his own possessions where they were, so as to have them when he returned; the ship which  promised him to carry the gifts for his siblings, he said he would accept. Having given the same instructions to  too,  sent them all to the coast.\n\n\nThey came down to the city of  in , and there chartered two triremes, as well as a great galley laden with all good things; and when everything was ready they set sail for , where they surveyed and mapped the coasts to which they came; until having viewed the greater and most famous parts they reached  in .\nThere , king of the , out of sympathy for , took the steering gear off the Median ships and put the  under a guard, calling them spies. While they were in this plight,  made his way to ; and  did not set the  free and give them back what he had taken from their ships until the physician was in his own country.\n\n\nThe  sailed from  and pursued  to , where they found him in the marketplace and tried to seize him.\nSome , who feared the  power, would have given him up; but others resisted and beat the  with their sticks. Men of , watch what you do, said the ; you are harboring an escaped slave of the King's.\nHow do you think  will like this insolence? What good will it do you if he gets away from us? What city will we attack first here? Which will we try to enslave first?\nBut the men of  paid no attention to them; so the  lost  and the galley with which they had come, and sailed back for , making no attempt to visit and learn of the further parts of  now that their guide was taken from them.\nBut  gave them a message as they were setting sail; they should tell , he said, that  was engaged to the daughter of . For  held the name of  the wrestler in great honor; and, to my thinking,  sought this match and paid a great sum for it to show  that he was a man of influence in his own country as well as in .\n\n\nThe  then put out from ; but their ships were wrecked on the coast of , and they were made slaves in the country until , an exile from , released and restored them to , who was ready to give him whatever he wanted in return.\n\n chose to be restored to  and told the story of his misfortune; but, so as not to be the occasion of agitating , if on his account a great expedition sailed against , he said that it was enough that the  alone be his escort; for he supposed that the  would be the readier to receive him back as the  were their friends.\n\n kept his word, and sent a messenger to the men of , telling them to take  back to . They obeyed ; but they could not persuade the , and were not able to apply force.\nThis is what happened, and these  were the first who came from  into , and they came to view the country for this reason.\n\n\nAfter this,  conquered , the greatest of all city states,  or barbarian, the reason for his conquest being this: when , son of , invaded , many  came with the army, some to trade, as was natural, and some to see the country itself; among them was , son of , who was ' brother and in exile from .\nThis  had a stroke of good luck. He was in the market at  wearing a red cloak, when , at that time one of ' guard and as yet a man of no great importance, saw him, and coveting the cloak came and tried to buy it.\nWhen  saw ' eagerness, by good luck he said, I will not sell this for any money, but I give it to you free if you must have it so much. Extolling this,  accepted the garment.\n\n\n supposed that he had lost his cloak out of foolish good nature. But in time  died, the seven rebelled against the , and  of the seven came to the throne;  then learned that the successor to the royal power was the man to whom he had given the garment in ; so he went up to  and sat in the king's antechamber, saying that he was one of ' benefactors.\nWhen the doorkeeper brought word of this to the king,  asked But to what  benefactor can I owe thanks? In the little time since I have been king hardly one of that nation has come to us, and I have, I may say, no use for any . Nevertheless bring him in, so that I may know what he means.\nThe doorkeeper brought  in and the interpreters asked him as he stood there who he was and what he had done to call himself the king's benefactor. Then  told the story of the cloak, and said that it was he who had given it.\n\nMost generous man, said , it was you who gave me a present when I had as yet no power; and if it was a small one, I was none the less grateful then than I am now when I get a big one. In return, I give you gold and silver in abundance so you may never be sorry that you did  son of  good.\n\n answered, Do not give me gold, O king, or silver, but , my country, which our slave has now that my brother  has been killed by ; give me this without killing or enslaving.\n\n\nHaving heard this,  sent an army and , one of the seven, to command it, instructing him to do whatever  asked. So  went down to the coast and got his army ready.\n\n\nNow  was ruled by , son of , who had authority delegated by . He wanted to be the justest of men, but that was impossible.\nFor when he learned of ' death, first he set up an altar to  the Liberator and marked out around it that sacred enclosure which is still to be seen in the suburb of the city; when this had been done, he called an assembly of all the citizens, and addressed them thus:\n\nTo me, as you know, have come ' scepter and all of his power, and it is in my power now to rule you. But I, so far as it lies in me, shall not do myself what I blame in my neighbor. I always disliked it that  or any other man should lord it over men like himself.  has fulfilled his destiny, and inviting you to share his power I proclaim equality.\nOnly I claim for my own privilege that six talents of ' wealth be set apart for my use, and that I and my descendants keep the priesthood of  the Liberator, whose temple I have founded, and now I give you freedom.\nSuch was ' promise to the . But one of them arose and answered: But you are not even fit to rule us, low-born and vermin, but you had better give an account of the monies that you have handled.\n\n\nThis was the speech of , a man of consequence among the citizens. But , realizing that if he let go of the sovereignty someone else would make himself sovereign instead, resolved not to let it go. Withdrawing into the acropolis, he sent for the citizens individually as if he would give an account of the money; then he seized and bound them.\nSo they were imprisoned, and afterwards  fell sick. His brother  thought him likely to die, and, so that he might the more easily make himself master of , he put all the prisoners to death. They had, it would seem, no desire to be free.\n\n\nSo when the  brought  back to , no one raised a hand against them, but  and those of his faction offered to evacuate the island under a flag of truce;  agreed to this, and after the treaty was made, the  of highest rank sat down on seats facing the acropolis.\n\n\nNow  the sovereign had a crazy brother named , who lay bound in the dungeon for some offense; this man heard what was going on, and by peering through the dungeon window saw the  sitting there peaceably;\n\nwhereupon he cried with a loud voice that he wanted to talk to . His brother, hearing him, had  loosed and brought before him. No sooner had he been brought than he attempted with reviling and abuse to persuade  to attack the . Although I am your brother, you coward, he said, and did no wrong deserving of prison, you have bound and imprisoned me; but when you see the  throwing you out of house and home, you have no courage to avenge yourself, though you could so easily beat them?\nIf you are yourself afraid of them, give me your foreign guards, and I will punish them for coming here; as for you, I will give you safe conduct out of the island.\n\n\nThis was what  said; and  took his advice, to my thinking not because he was so foolish as to suppose that he would be strong enough to defeat the king, but because he did not want  to recover  safe and sound with no trouble.\nHe wanted therefore by provoking the  to weaken  as much as he could before surrendering it, for he was well aware that if the  were hurt they would be furiously angry with the . Besides, he knew that he could get himself safely off the island whenever he liked, having built a secret passage leading from the acropolis to the sea.\n\n then set sail from ; but  armed all the guards, opened the acropolis' gates, and attacked the . These supposed that a full agreement had been made, and were taken unawares; the guard fell upon them and killed the  of highest rank, those who were carried in litters.\nThey were engaged in this when the rest of the  force came up in reinforcement, and, hard-pressed, the guards retreated into the acropolis.\n\n\nThe  captain , seeing how big a loss the  had suffered, deliberately forgot the command given him at his departure by  not to kill or enslave any  but to deliver the island intact to ; and he commanded his army to kill everyone they took, men and boys alike.\nThen, while some of the  laid siege to the acropolis, the rest killed everyone they met, inside the temples and outside the temples alike.\n\n\n sailed to , escaping from ; and after he arrived there and brought up the possessions with which he had left his country, it became his habit to make a display of silver and gold drinking cups; while his servants were cleaning these, he would converse with the king of ,  son of , and would bring him to his house. As  marvelled greatly at the cups whenever he saw them,  would tell him to take as many as he liked.\n\n made this offer two or three times;  showed his great integrity in that he would not accept; but realizing that there were others in  from whom  would get help by offering them the cups, he went to the ephors and told them it would be best for  if this  stranger quit the country, lest he persuade  himself or some other  to do evil. The ephors listened to his advice and banished  by proclamation.\n\n\nAs for , the  swept it clear and turned it over uninhabited to . But afterwards , the  general, helped to settle the land, prompted by a dream and a disease that he contracted in his genitals.\n\n\nWhile the fleet was away at , the  revolted. They had made very good preparation; for during the reign of the , and the rebellion of the seven, they had taken advantage of the time and the confusion to provision themselves against the siege; and (I cannot tell how) this went undetected.\nAt last they revolted openly and did this:sending away all the mothers, each chose one woman, whomever he liked of his domestics, as a bread-maker; as for the rest, they gathered them together and strangled them so they would not consume their bread.\n\n\nWhen  heard of this, he collected all his forces and led them against , and he marched up to the town and laid siege to it; but the  thought nothing of the siege. They came up on to the ramparts of the wall and taunted  and his army with gesture and word, and one of them uttered this mot:\n\nWhy loiter there, , and not go away? You will take us when mules give birth. One of the  said this, by no means expecting that a mule would give birth.\n\n\nA year and seven months passed, and  and his whole army were bitter because they could not take . Yet  had used every trick and every device against it. He tried the stratagem by which  took it, and every other stratagem and device, yet with no success; for the  kept a vigilant watch, and he could not take them.\n\n\nBut in the twentieth month of the siege a marvellous thing befell , son of that  who was one of the seven destroyers of the : one of his food-carrying mules gave birth.  would not believe the news; but when he saw the foal for himself, he told those who had seen it to tell no one;\n\nthen reflecting he recalled the 's word at the beginning of the siegethat the city would be taken when mules gave birthand having this utterance in mind he conceived that  might be taken; for the hand of heaven, he supposed, was in the man's word and the birth from his own mule.\n\n\nAs soon as he thought that it was 's fate to fall, he came and inquired of  if taking  were very important to him; and when he was assured that it was, he then cast about for a plan by which the city's fall would be accomplished by him alone; for good service among the  is very much esteemed, and rewarded by high preferment.\nHe could think of no other way to bring the city down than to mutilate himself and then desert to the ; so, making light of it, he mutilated himself beyond repair, and after cutting off his nose and ears and cropping his hair as a disfigurement and scourging himself, he came before .\n\n\nThe king reacted very violently to seeing a man so well-respected mutilated, and springing from the throne he uttered a cry and asked  who it was who had mutilated him and why.\n\nThere is no man, he said, except you, who has enough power to do this to me, and no one but I myself did this, O King, because I felt it terribly that  were laughing at .\n\n answered, Unfeeling man, you give a pretty name to an ugly act if you say that it was on account of those besieged that you did for yourself past cure. Why, you poor fool, will the enemy surrender sooner because you mutilated yourself? How could you not have been out of your mind to disfigure yourself?\n\nHad I told you, said , what I intended to do, you would not have let me; but now I have done it on my own. Now, then, if you do your part we shall take . I shall desert to the city as I am, and I shall say to them that I suffered this at your hands; and I think that I shall persuade them, and thus gain a command.\nNow, on the tenth day after I enter the city, take a thousand men from the part of your army about which you will least care if it is lost, and post them before the gate called the gate of ; on the seventh day after that, post two thousand more before the gate called the gate of the ; and when twenty days are past after that seventh, lead out four thousand more and post them before the  gate, as they call it; allow neither these, nor the others that go before them, to carry any weapons except daggers; leave them these.\nBut immediately after the twentieth day command the rest of your army to assault the whole circuit of the walls, and post the  before the gate of  and the gate called . For I think that once I have done conspicuous things the  will give me, among other things, the keys of their gates; then it will depend on me and on the  to do what is necessary.\n\n\nHaving given these instructions, he went to the gates, turning and looking back as though he were in fact a deserter. When the watch posted on the towers saw him, they ran down, and opening half the gate a little asked him who he was and why he came; he told them that he was  and was deserting to them.\nWhen they heard this, the gatekeepers brought him before the general assembly of the , where he made a pitiful sight, saying that he had suffered at the hands of  what he had suffered at his own because he had advised the king to lead his army away, since they could find no way to take the city.\n\nNow, he said in his speech to them, I come as a great boon to you, men of , and as a great bane to  and to his army and to the ; for he shall not get away with having mutilated me so; and I know all the issues of his plans. This was what he said.\n\n\nWhen the  saw the most well-respected man in  without his nose and ears and all lurid with blood from the scourging, they were quite convinced that he was telling them the truth and came as their ally, and were ready to give him all that he asked; and he asked for a command.\nWhen he got this from them, he did exactly as he had arranged with . On the tenth day he led out the  army, surrounded and slaughtered the thousand whom he had instructed  to put in the field first.\nSeeing that he produced works equal to his words, the  were overjoyed and ready to serve him in every way. When the agreed number of days was past, he led out once more a chosen body of , and slaughtered the two thousand men of ' army.\nWhen the  saw this work too, the praise of  was on everyone's lips. The agreed number of days once again passing, he led out his men to the place he had named, where he surrounded the four thousand and slaughtered them. And when he had done this,  was the one man for : he was made the commander of their armies and guard of the walls.\n\n\nSo when  assaulted the whole circuit of the walls, according to the agreed plan, then ' treason was fully revealed. For while the townsmen were on the wall defending it against ' assault, he opened the gates called  and , and let the  inside the walls.\nThose  who saw what he did fled to the temple of that  whom they call ; those who had not seen it remained in position, until they too discovered how they had been betrayed.\n\n\nThus  was taken a second time, and when  was master of the , he destroyed their walls and tore away all their gates, neither of which  had done at the first taking of ; moreover he impaled about three thousand men that were prominent among them; as for the rest, he gave them back their city to live in.\nFurther, as the , fearing for their food, had strangled their own women, as I described above,  provided wives to give them a posterity by appointing that each of the neighboring nations should send a certain number of women to ; the sum of the women thus collected was fifty thousand: these were the mothers of those who now inhabit the city.\n\n\nThere never was in ' judgment any  before or after who did better service than , except , with whom no  could compare himself. Many times  is said to have declared that he would rather  were free of disfigurement than have twenty  on top of the one he had.\nHe honored him very much; every year he sent him such gifts as the  hold most precious, and let him govern  all his life with no tribute to pay, giving him many other things besides. This  was the father of , who was general of an army in  against the  and their allies; and ' son was that  who deserted from the  to ."}}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "4", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1",

For since  was bursting with men and vast revenues were coming in,  desired to punish the  for the wrong they had begun when they invaded Media first and defeated those who opposed them in battle.\nFor the , as I have said before, ruled upper  for twenty-eight years; they invaded  in their pursuit of the , and ended the power of the , who were the rulers of  before the  came.\nBut when the  had been away from their homes for twenty-eight years and returned to their country after so long an absence, as much trouble as their Median war awaited them. They found themselves opposed by a great force; for the  women, when their husbands were away for so long, turned to their slaves.\n\n\nNow the  blind all their slaves, because of the milk they drink; and this is how they get it: taking tubes of bone very much like flutes, they insert these into the genitalia of the mares and blow into them, some blowing while others milk. According to them, their reason for doing this is that blowing makes the mare's veins swell and her udder drop.\nWhen done milking, they pour the milk into deep wooden buckets, and make their slaves stand around the buckets and shake the milk; they draw off what stands on the surface and value this most; what lies at the bottom is less valued. This is why the  blind all prisoners whom they take: for they do not cultivate the soil, but are nomads.\n\n\nSo it came about that a younger generation grew up, born of these slaves and the women; and when the youths learned of their parentage, they came out to fight the  returning from Media.\nFirst they barred the way to their country by digging a wide trench from the  to the broadest part of the ; and then, when the  tried to force a passage, they camped opposite them and engaged them in battle.\nThere were many fights, and the  could gain no advantage; at last one of them said, Men of , look at what we are doing! We are fighting our own slaves; they kill us, and we grow fewer; we kill them, and shall have fewer slaves.\nNow, then, my opinion is that we should drop our spears and bows, and meet them with horsewhips in our hands. As long as they see us armed, they imagine that they are our equals and the sons of our equals; let them see us with whips and no weapons, and they will perceive that they are our slaves; and taking this to heart they will not face our attack.\n\n\nThe  heard this and acted on it; and their enemies, stunned by what they saw, did not think of fighting, but fled. Thus, the  ruled  and were driven out again by the , and returned to their own country in such a way. Desiring to punish them for what they had done,  assembled an army against them.\n\n\nThe  say that their nation is the youngest in the world, and that it came into being in this way. A man whose name was  appeared in this country, which was then desolate. They say that his parents were  and a daughter of the  (I do not believe the story, but it is told).\nSuch was ' lineage; and he had three sons: , , and , youngest of the three.\nIn the time of their rule (the story goes) certain implementsnamely, a plough, a yoke, a sword, and a flask, all of goldfell down from the sky into . The eldest of them, seeing these, approached them meaning to take them; but the gold began to burn as he neared, and he stopped.\nThen the second approached, and the gold did as before. When these two had been driven back by the burning gold, the youngest brother approached and the burning stopped, and he took the gold to his own house. In view of this, the elder brothers agreed to give all the royal power to the youngest.\n\n\n, it is said, was the father of the  clan called ; , the second brother, of those called  and ; the youngest, who was king, of those called .\nAll these together bear the name of , after their king;  is the name given them by . This, then, is the ' account of their origin,\n\n\nand they say that neither more nor less than a thousand years in all passed from the time of their first king  to the entry of  into their country. The kings guard this sacred gold very closely, and every year offer solemn sacrifices of propitiation to it.\nWhoever falls asleep at this festival in the open air, having the sacred gold with him, is said by the  not to live out the year; for which reason (they say) as much land as he can ride round in one day is given to him. Because of the great size of the country, the lordships that  established for his sons were three, one of which, where they keep the gold, was the greatest.\nAbove and north of the neighbors of their country no one (they say) can see or travel further, because of showers of feathers; for earth and sky are full of feathers, and these hinder sight.\n\n\nThis is what the  say about themselves and the country north of them. But the story told by the  who live in  is as follows. , driving the cattle of , came to this land, which was then desolate, but is now inhabited by the .\n\n lived west of the , settled in the island called by the  , on the shore of Ocean near , outside the pillars of . As for Ocean, the  say that it flows around the whole world from where the sun rises, but they cannot prove that this is so.\n\n came from there to the country now called , where, encountering wintry and frosty weather, he drew his lion's skin over him and fell asleep, and while he slept his mares, which were grazing yoked to the chariot, were spirited away by divine fortune.\n\n\nWhen  awoke, he searched for them, visiting every part of the country, until at last he came to the land called the Woodland, and there he found in a cave a creature of double form that was half maiden and half serpent; above the buttocks she was a woman, below them a snake.\nWhen he saw her he was astonished, and asked her if she had seen his mares straying; she said that she had them, and would not return them to him before he had intercourse with her;  did, in hope of this reward.\nBut though he was anxious to take the horses and go, she delayed returning them, so that she might have  with her for as long as possible; at last she gave them back, telling him, These mares came, and I kept them safe here for you, and you have paid me for keeping them, for I have three sons by you.\nNow tell me what I am to do when they are grown up: shall I keep them here (since I am queen of this country), or shall I send them away to you? Thus she inquired, and then (it is said)  answered:\n\nWhen you see the boys are grown up, do as follows and you will do rightly: whichever of them you see bending this bow and wearing this belt so, make him an inhabitant of this land; but whoever falls short of these accomplishments that I require, send him away out of the country. Do so and you shall yourself have comfort, and my will shall be done.\n\n\nSo he drew one of his bows (for until then  always carried two), and showed her the belt, and gave her the bow and the belt, that had a golden vessel on the end of its clasp; and, having given them, he departed. But when the sons born to her were grown men, she gave them names, calling one of them  and the next  and the youngest Scythes; furthermore, remembering the instructions, she did as she was told.\nTwo of her sons,  and , were cast out by their mother and left the country, unable to fulfill the requirements set; but Scythes, the youngest, fulfilled them and so stayed in the land.\n\n son of  comes the whole line of the kings of ; and it is because of the vessel that the  carry vessels on their belts to this day. This alone his mother did for Scythes. This is what the  dwellers in  say.\n\n\nThere is yet another story, to which account I myself especially incline. It is to this effect. The nomadic  inhabiting , when hard pressed in war by the , fled across the  river to the  country (for the country which the  now inhabit is said to have belonged to the  before),\n\nand the , at the advance of the , deliberated as men threatened by a great force should. Opinions were divided; both were strongly held, but that of the princes was the more honorable; for the people believed that their part was to withdraw and that there was no need to risk their lives for the dust of the earth; but the princes were for fighting to defend their country against the attackers.\nNeither side could persuade the other, neither the people the princes nor the princes the people; the one party planned to depart without fighting and leave the country to their enemies, but the princes were determined to lie dead in their own country and not to flee with the people, for they considered how happy their situation had been and what ills were likely to come upon them if they fled from their native land.\nHaving made up their minds, the princes separated into two equal bands and fought with each other until they were all killed by each other's hands; then the  people buried them by the , where their tombs are still to be seen, and having buried them left the land; and the  came and took possession of the country left empty.\n\n\nAnd to this day there are  walls in , and a  ferry, and there is a country  and a strait named .\nFurthermore, it is evident that the  in their flight from the  into  also made a colony on the peninsula where the  city of  has since been founded; and it is clear that the  pursued them and invaded Media, missing their way;\n\nfor the  always fled along the coast, and the  pursued with the  on their right until they came into the Median land, turning inland on their way. That is the other story current among  and foreigners alike.\n\n\nThere is also a story related in a poem by  son of , a man of . This , possessed by , visited the ; beyond these (he said) live the one-eyed , beyond whom are the griffins that guard gold, and beyond these again the , whose territory reaches to the sea.\nExcept for the , all these nations (and first the ) are always at war with their neighbors; the  were pushed from their lands by the , and the  by the , and the , living by the southern sea, were hard pressed by the  and left their country. Thus ' story does not agree with the  account about this country.\n\n\nWhere  who wrote this came from, I have already said; I will tell the story that I heard about him at  and . It is said that this , who was as well-born as any of his townsfolk, went into a fuller's shop at  and there died; the owner shut his shop and went away to tell the dead man's relatives,\n\nand the report of ' death being spread about in the city was disputed by a man of , who had come from the town of , and said that he had met  going toward  and spoken with him. While he argued vehemently, the relatives of the dead man came to the fuller's shop with all that was necessary for burial;\n\nbut when the place was opened, there was no  there, dead or alive. But in the seventh year after that,  appeared at  and made that poem which the  now call the , after which he vanished once again.\n\n\nSuch is the tale told in these two towns. But this, I know, happened to the  in , two hundred and forty years after the second disappearance of , as reckoning made at  and  shows me:\n\n, so the  say, appeared in their country and told them to set up an altar to , and set beside it a statue bearing the name of  the ; for, he said,  had come to their country alone of all  lands, and hethe man who was now , but then when he followed the god had been a crowhad come with him.\nAfter saying this, he vanished. The , so they say, sent to  and asked the god what the vision of the man could mean; and the  priestess told them to obey the vision, saying that their fortune would be better.\nThey did as instructed. And now there stands beside the image of  a statue bearing the name of ; a grove of bay-trees surrounds it; the image is set in the marketplace. Let it suffice that I have said this much about .\n\n\nAs for the land of which my history has begun to speak, no one exactly knows what lies north of it; for I can find out from no one who claims to know as an eyewitness. For even , whom I recently mentionedeven he did not claim to have gone beyond the , even though a poet; but he spoke by hearsay of what lay north, saying that the  had told him.\nBut all that we have been able to learn for certain by report of the farthest lands shall be told.\n\n\nNorth of the port of the , which lies midway along the coast of , the first inhabitants are the , who are ; and beyond them another tribe called ; these and the , though in other ways they live like the , plant and eat grain, onions, garlic, lentils, and millet.\nAbove the  live  farmers, who plant grain not to eat but to sell; north of these, the ; north of the , the land is uninhabited so far as we know.\n\n\nThese are the tribes by the , west of the . But on the other side of the , the tribe nearest to the sea is the tribe of the Woodlands; and north of these live  farmers, whom the  colonists on the  (who call themselves ) call .\nThese farming  inhabit a land stretching east a three days' journey to a river called , and north as far as an eleven days' voyage up the ; and north of these the land is desolate for a long way;\n\nafter the desolation is the country of the , who are a nation apart and by no means ; and beyond them is true desolation, where no nation of men lives, as far as we know.\n\n\nBut to the east of these farming , across the , you are in the land of nomadic , who plant nothing, nor plough; and all these lands except the Woodlands are bare of trees. These nomads inhabit a country to the east that stretches fourteen days' journey to the .\n\n\nAcross the  are those lands called Royal, where the best and most numerous of the  are, who consider all other  their slaves; their territory stretches south to the  land, and east to the trench that was dug by the sons of the blind men, and to the port called  on the ; and part of it stretches to the  river.\nNorth of the Royal  live the , who are of another and not a  stock; and beyond the  the land is all marshes and uninhabited by men, so far as we know.\n\n\nAcross the  it is no longer ; the first of the districts belongs to the , whose country begins at the inner end of the  and stretches fifteen days' journey north, and is quite bare of both wild and cultivated trees. Above these in the second district, the  inhabit a country thickly overgrown with trees of all kinds.\n\n\nNorth of the  the land is uninhabited for seven days' journey; after this desolation, and somewhat more toward the east wind, live the , a numerous and a separate nation, who live by hunting.\nAdjoining these and in the same country live the people called ; these also live by hunting, in the way that I will describe. The hunter climbs a tree, and sits there concealed; for trees grow thickly all over the land; and each man has his horse at hand, trained to flatten on its belly for the sake of lowness, and his dog; and when he sees the quarry from the tree, he shoots with the bow and mounts his horse and pursues it, and the dog follows close behind.\nBeyond these and somewhat to the east live  again, who revolted from the Royal  and came to this country.\n\n\nAs for the countryside of these , all the land mentioned up to this point is level and its soil deep; but thereafter it is stony and rough.\nAfter a long journey through this rough country, there are men inhabiting the foothills of high mountains, who are said to be bald from birth (male and female alike) and snub-nosed and with long beards; they speak their own language, and wear  clothing, and their food comes from trees.\nThe tree by which they live is called ; it is about the size of a fig-tree, and bears a fruit as big as a bean, with a stone in it. When this fruit is ripe, they strain it through cloth, and a thick black liquid comes from it, which they call aschu; they lick this up or drink it mixed with milk, and from the thickest lees of it they make cakes, and eat them.\nThey have few cattle, for the pasture in their land is not good. They each live under a tree, covering it in winter with a white felt cloth, but using no felt in summer.\nThese people are wronged by no man, for they are said to be sacred; nor have they any weapon of war. They judge the quarrels between their neighbors; furthermore, whatever banished man has taken refuge with them is wronged by no one. They are called .\n\n\nNow as far as the land of these bald men, we have full knowledge of the country and the nations on the near side of them; for some of the  make their way to them, from whom it is easy to get knowledge, and from some of the , too, from the  port and the other ports of ; such  as visit them transact their business with seven interpreters and in seven languages.\n\n\nAs far as these men this country is known, then, but what lies north of the bald men no one can say with exact knowledge; for high and impassable mountains bar the way, and no one crosses them. These bald men say (although I do not believe them) that the mountains are inhabited by men with goats' feet, and that beyond these are men who sleep for six months of the twelve. This I cannot accept as true at all.\nBut the country east of the bald-heads is known for certain to be inhabited by the ; however, of what lies north either of the bald-heads or the  we have no knowledge, except what comes from the report of these latter.\n\n\nIt is said to be the custom of the  that, whenever a man's father dies, all the nearest of kin bring beasts of the flock and, having killed these and cut up the flesh, they also cut up the dead father of their host, and set out all the flesh mixed together for a feast.\nAs for his head, they strip it bare and clean and gild it, and keep it for a sacred relic, to which they offer solemn sacrifice yearly. Every son does this for his father, just like the  in their festivals in honor of the dead. In other respects, these are said to be a law-abiding people, too, and the women to have equal power with the men.\n\n\nOf these too, then, we have knowledge; but as for what is north of them, it is from the  that the tale comes of the one-eyed men and the griffins that guard gold; this is told by the , who have heard it from them; and we have taken it as true from the , and call these people by the  name, ; for in the  tongue arima is one, and spou is the eye.\n\n\nAll the aforesaid country is exceedingly cold: for eight months of every year there is unbearable frost, and during these you do not make mud by pouring out water but by lighting a fire; the sea freezes, as does all the ; and the  living on this side of the trench lead armies over the ice, and drive their wagons across to the land of the .\nSo it is winter for eight months, and cold in that country for the four that remain. Here, there is a different sort of winter than the winters in other lands: for in the season for rain scarcely any falls, but all summer it rains unceasingly;\n\nand when there are thunderstorms in other lands, here there are none, but in summer there are plenty of them; if there is a thunderstorm in winter they are apt to wonder at it as at a portent. And so, too, if there is an earthquake summer or winter, it is considered a portent in .\nHorses have the endurance to bear the  winter; mules and asses cannot bear it at all; and yet in other lands, while asses and mules can endure frost, horses that stand in it are frostbitten.\n\n\nAnd in my opinion it is for this reason that the hornless kind of cattle grow no horns in . A verse of Homer in the  attests to my opinion:\nin which it is correctly observed that in hot countries the horns grow quickly, whereas in very cold countries beasts hardly grow horns, or not at all.\n\n\nIn , then, this happens because of the cold. But I think it strange (for it was always the way of my history to investigate excurses) that in the whole of  no mules can be conceived although the country is not cold, nor is there any evident cause. The  themselves say that it is because of a curse that mules cannot be conceived among them;\n\nbut whenever the season is at hand for the mares to conceive, they drive them into the countries of their neighbors, and then send the asses after them, until the mares are pregnant, and then they drive them home again.\n\n\nBut regarding the feathers of which the  say that the air is full, so thickly that no one can see or traverse the land beyond, I have this opinion. North of that country snow falls continually, though less in summer than in winter, as is to be expected.\nWhoever has seen snow falling thickly near him knows himself my meaning; for snow is like feathers; and because of the winter, which is as I have said, the regions to the north of this continent are uninhabited. I think therefore that in this story of feathers the  and their neighbors only speak of snow figuratively. So, then, I have spoken of those parts that are said to be most distant.\n\n\nConcerning the  people, neither the  nor any other inhabitants of these lands tell us anything, except perhaps the . And, I think, even they say nothing; for if they did, then the , too, would have told, just as they tell of the one-eyed men. But  speaks of , and Homer too in his poem , if that is truly the work of Homer.\n\n\nBut the  say much more about them than any others do. They say that offerings wrapped in straw are brought from the  to ; when these have passed , each nation in turn receives them from its neighbors until they are carried to the , which is the most westerly limit of their journey;\n\nfrom there, they are brought on to the south, the people of  being the first  to receive them. From  they come down to the  gulf, and are carried across to , and one city sends them on to another until they come to ; after this,  is left out of their journey, for  carry them to , and  to .\nThus (they say) these offerings come to . But on the first journey, the  sent two maidens bearing the offerings, to whom the  give the names  and , and five men of their people with them as escort for safe conduct, those who are now called  and greatly honored at .\nBut when those whom they sent never returned, they took it amiss that they should be condemned always to be sending people and not getting them back, and so they carry the offerings, wrapped in straw, to their borders, and tell their neighbors to send them on from their own country to the next;\n\nand the offerings, it is said, come by this conveyance to . I can say of my own knowledge that there is a custom like these offerings; namely, that when the  and  women sacrifice to the Royal , they have straw with them while they sacrifice.\n\n\nI know that they do this. The  girls and boys cut their hair in honor of these  maidens, who died at ; the girls before their marriage cut off a tress and lay it on the tomb, wound around a spindle\n\n(this tomb is at the foot of an olive-tree, on the left hand of the entrance of the temple of ); the  boys twine some of their hair around a green stalk, and lay it on the tomb likewise.\n\n\nIn this way, then, these maidens are honored by the inhabitants of . These same  relate that two virgins,  and , came from the  by way of the aforesaid peoples to  earlier than  and ;\n\nthese latter came to bring to  the tribute which they had agreed to pay for easing child-bearing; but  and , they say, came with the gods themselves, and received honors of their own from the .\nFor the women collected gifts for them, calling upon their names in the hymn made for them by  of ; it was from  that the islanders and  learned to sing hymns to  and , calling upon their names and collecting gifts (this , after coming from , also made the other and ancient hymns that are sung at ).\nFurthermore, they say that when the thighbones are burnt in sacrifice on the altar, the ashes are all cast on the burial-place of  and , behind the temple of , looking east, nearest the refectory of the people of .\n\n\nI have said this much of the , and let it suffice; for I do not tell the story of that , alleged to be a , who carried the arrow over the whole world, fasting all the while. But if there are men beyond the north wind, then there are others beyond the south.\nAnd I laugh to see how many have before now drawn maps of the world, not one of them reasonably; for they draw the world as round as if fashioned by compasses, encircled by the , and  and  of a like extent. For myself, I will in a few words indicate the extent of the two, and how each should be drawn.\n\n\nThe land where the  live extends to the southern sea which is called Red; beyond these to the north are the , and beyond the  the , and beyond the  the , whose country extends to the northern sea into which the  flows; so these four nations live between the one sea and the other.\n\n\nBut west of this region two peninsulas stretch out from it into the sea, which I will now describe.\nOn the north side one of the peninsulas begins at the  and stretches seaward along the  and the , as far as  in the ; on the south side, the same peninsula has a seacoast beginning at the  that is near , and stretching seaward as far as the  headland. On this peninsula live thirty nations.\n\n\nThis is the first peninsula. But the second, beginning with , stretches to the , and is  land; and next, the neighboring land of ; and after , ; this peninsula ends (not truly but only by common consent) at the , to which  brought a canal from the .\nNow from the  country to  there is a wide and vast tract of land; and from  this peninsula runs beside our sea by way of the  and , which is at the end of it; in this peninsula there are just three nations.\n\n\nSo much for the parts of  west of the . But what is beyond the , and , and , and , east and toward the rising sun, this is bounded on the one hand by the , and to the north by the  and the , which flows toward the sun's rising.\nAs far as ,  is an inhabited land; but thereafter, all to the east is desolation, nor can anyone say what kind of land is there.\n\n\nSuch is , and such its extent. But  is on this second peninsula; for  comes next after . The  part of this peninsula is narrow; for from our sea to the  it is a distance of a hundred and twenty-five miles; that is, a thousand stades; but after this narrow part, the peninsula which is called  is very broad.\n\n\nI wonder, then, at those who have mapped out and divided the world into , , and ; for the difference between them is great, seeing that in length  stretches along both the others together, and it appears to me to be wider beyond all comparison.\nFor  shows clearly that it is bounded by the sea, except where it borders on .  king of  first discovered this and made it known. When he had finished digging the canal which leads from the  to the , he sent  in ships, instructing them to sail on their return voyage past the Pillars of  until they came into the northern sea and so to .\nSo the  set out from the  and sailed the southern sea; whenever autumn came they would put in and plant the land in whatever part of  they had reached, and there await the harvest;\n\nthen, having gathered the crop, they sailed on, so that after two years had passed, it was in the third that they rounded the pillars of  and came to . There they said (what some may believe, though I do not) that in sailing around  they had the sun on their right hand.\n\n\nThus was the first knowledge of  gained. The next story is that of the : for as for  son of , an , he did not sail around , although he was sent for that purpose; but he feared the length and loneliness of the voyage and so returned without accomplishing the task laid upon him by his mother.\nFor he had raped the virgin daughter of  son of ; and when on this charge he was to be impaled by , ' mother, who was ' sister, interceded for his life, saying that she would impose a heavier punishment on him than ;\n\nfor he would be compelled to sail around , until he completed his voyage and came to the .  agreed to this, and  went to  where he received a ship and a crew from the , and sailed past the Pillars of .\nHaving sailed out beyond them, and rounded the  promontory called , he sailed south; but when he had been many months sailing over the sea, and always more before him, he turned back and made sail for .\nComing to  from there, he related in his narrative that, when he was farthest distant, he sailed by a country of little men, who wore palm-leaf clothing; these, whenever he and his men put in to land with their ship, left their towns and fled to the hills; he and his men did no harm when they landed, and took nothing from the people except cattle.\nAs to his not sailing completely around , the reason (he said) was that the ship could move no farther, but was stopped. But  did not believe that  spoke the truth, and, as the task appointed was unfulfilled, he impaled him, punishing him on the charge first brought against him.\nThis  had a eunuch, who as soon as he heard of his master's death escaped to , with a great hoard of wealth, of which a man of  got possession. I know the man's name but deliberately omit it.\n\n\nBut as to , most of it was discovered by . There is a river, , second of all rivers in the production of crocodiles. , desiring to know where this  empties into the sea, sent ships manned by , a man of , and others whose word he trusted;\n\nthese set out from the city of  and the  country, and sailed down the river toward the east and the sunrise until they came to the sea; and voyaging over the sea west, they came in the thirtieth month to that place from which the  king sent the above-mentioned  to sail around .\nAfter this circumnavigation,  subjugated the  and made use of this sea. Thus it was discovered that , except the parts toward the rising sun, was in other respects like .\n\n\nBut it is plain that none have obtained knowledge of 's eastern or northern regions, so as to be able say if it is bounded by seas; its length is known to be enough to stretch along both  and .\nI cannot guess for what reason the earth, which is one, has three names, all women's, and why the boundary lines set for it are the  and the  (though some say that the  and the  are boundaries); and I cannot learn the names of those who divided the world, or where they got the names which they used.\nFor  is said by most  to be named after a native woman of that name, and  after the wife of ; yet the  claim a share in the latter name, saying that  was not named after ' wife , but after , the son of , who was the son of Manes, and that from him the  clan at  also takes its name.\nBut as for , no men have any knowledge whether it is bounded by seas or not, or where it got its name, nor is it clear who gave the name, unless we say that the land took its name from the  , having been (it would seem) before then nameless like the rest.\nBut it is plain that this woman was of  birth, and never came to this land which the  now call , but only from  to  and from  to . Thus much I have said of these matters, and let it suffice; we will use the names established by custom.\n\n\nNowhere are men so ignorant as in the lands by the   (excluding the  nation) into which  led his army. For we cannot show that any nation within the region of the  has any cleverness, nor do we know of (overlooking the  nation and ) any notable man born there.\nBut the  race has made the cleverest discovery that we know in what is the most important of all human affairs; I do not praise the  in all respects, but in this, the most important: that they have contrived that no one who attacks them can escape, and no one can catch them if they do not want to be found.\nFor when men have no established cities or forts, but are all nomads and mounted archers, not living by tilling the soil but by raising cattle and carrying their dwellings on wagons, how can they not be invincible and unapproachable?\n\n\nThey have made this discovery in a land that suits their purpose and has rivers that are their allies; for their country is flat and grassy and well-watered, and rivers run through it not very many fewer in number than the canals of .\nAs many of them as are famous and can be entered from the sea, I shall name. There is the , which has five mouths, and the , and , and , and , and , and , and . Their courses are as I shall indicate.\n\n\nThe , the greatest of all rivers which we know, flows with the same volume in summer and winter; it is most westerly  of all, and the greatest because other rivers are its tributaries.\nThose that make it great, five flowing through the  country, are these: the river called by   and by  , and besides this the , the , the , and the .\nThe first-named of these rivers is a great stream flowing east and uniting its waters with the ; the second, the , is more westerly and smaller; the , , and  flow between these two and pour their waters into the .\n\n\nThese are the native-born  rivers that help to swell it; but the , which commingles with the , flows from the . The , , and , three other great rivers that pour into it, flow north from the heights of . The , the , and the  flow into the  from the country of the  in ; the , which cuts through the middle of , from the  and the mountain range of .\nThe  flows north from  into the Triballic plain and the , and the  into the , which receives these two great rivers into itself. The  and another river called  also flow northward, from the country north of the , to flow into it;\n\nfor the  traverses the whole of , rising among the , who are the most westerly dwellers in , except for the , and flowing thus clean across  it issues forth along the borders of .\n\n\nWith these rivers aforesaid, and many others, too, as its tributaries, the  becomes the greatest river of all, while river for river the  surpasses it in volume, since that owes its volume of water to no tributary river or spring.\nBut the  is always the same height in summer and winter, the reason for which, I think, is this. In winter it is of its customary size, or only a little greater than is natural to it, for in that country in winter there is very little rain, but snow everywhere.\nIn the summer, the abundant snow that has fallen in winter melts and pours from all sides into the ; so this snow-melt pours into the river and helps to swell it and much violent rain besides, as the summer is the season of rain.\nAnd in proportion as the sun draws to itself more water in summer than in winter, the water that commingles with the  is many times more abundant in summer than it is in winter; these opposites keep the balance true, so that the volume of the river appears always the same.\n\n\nOne of the rivers of the , then, is the . The next is the ; this comes from the north, flowing at first out of a great lake, which is the boundary between the  and the  countries; at the mouth of the river there is a settlement of , who are called .\n\n\nThe third river is the ; this comes from , flowing out of a great lake, around which wild, white horses graze. This lake is truly called the mother of the .\nHere, then, the  rises; for five days' journey its waters are shallow and still sweet; after that for four days' journey seaward it is amazingly bitter,\n\nfor a spring runs into it so bitter that although its volume is small its admixture taints the , one of the few great rivers of the world. This spring is on the border between the farming  and the ; the name of it and of the place where it rises is in Scythian ; in the  tongue, .\nThe  and the  draw near together in the ' country; after that they flow apart, the intervening space growing wider.\n\n\nThe fourth is the . This is the next greatest after the , and the most productive, in our judgment, not only of the  but of all rivers, except the  , with which no other river can be compared.\nBut of the rest, the  is the most productive; it provides the finest and best-nurturing pasture lands for beasts, and the fish in it are beyond all in their excellence and abundance. Its water is most sweet to drink, flowing with a clear current, whereas the other rivers are turbid. There is excellent soil on its banks, and very rich grass where the land is not planted;\n\nand self-formed crusts of salt abound at its mouth; it provides great spineless fish, called sturgeons, for salting, and many other wonderful things besides.\nIts course is from the north, and it is known as far as the  land; that is, for forty days' voyage; beyond that, no one can say through what nations it flows; but it is plain that it flows through desolate country to the land of the farming , who live beside it for a ten days' voyage.\nThis is the only river, besides the , whose source I cannot identify; nor, I think, can any . When the  comes near the sea, the  mingles with it, running into the same marsh;\n\nthe land between these rivers, where the land projects like a ship's beak, is called ' promontory; a temple of  stands there. The settlement of the  is beyond the temple, on the .\n\n\nThis is the produce of these rivers, and after these there is a fifth river called ; this also flows from the north out of a lake, and the land between it and the  is inhabited by the farming ; it flows into the woodland country, after passing which it mingles with the .\n\n\nThe sixth is the , which rises from a lake, and flowing through the midst of the nomadic  flows out near the city of , bordering on its right the Woodland and the region called the .\n\n\nThe seventh river, the , separates from the  at about the place which is the end of our knowledge of that river; at this place it separates, and has the same name as the place itself, ; then in its course to the sea it divides the country of the  and the country of the Royal , and empties into the .\n\n\nThe eighth is the  river; in its upper course, this begins by flowing out of a great lake, and enters a yet greater lake called the , which divides the Royal  from the ; another river, called , is a tributary of this .\n\n\nThese are the rivers of note with which the  are provided. For rearing cattle, the grass growing in  is the most productive of bile of all pastures which we know; that this is so can be judged by opening up the bodies of the cattle.\n\n\nThe most important things are thus provided them. It remains now to show the customs which are established among them. The only gods whom they propitiate are these:  in particular, and secondly  and Earth, whom they believe to be the wife of ; after these, , and the Heavenly , and , and . All the  worship these as gods; the  called Royal sacrifice to  also.\nIn the  tongue,  is called ;  (in my judgment most correctly so called) ; Earth is ;  ; the Heavenly  ;  . It is their practice to make images and altars and shrines for , but for no other god.\n\n\nIn all their sacred rites they follow the same method of sacrifice; this is how it is offered. The victim stands with its forefeet shackled together; the sacrificer stands behind the beast, and throws it down by pulling the end of the rope;\n\nas the victim falls, he invokes whatever god it is to whom he sacrifices. Then, throwing a noose around the beast's neck, he thrusts in a stick and twists it and so strangles the victim, lighting no fire nor offering the first-fruits, nor pouring any libation; and having strangled and skinned the beast, he sets about cooking it.\n\n\nNow as the  land is quite bare of wood, this is how they contrive to cook the meat. When they have skinned the victims, they strip the meat from the bones and throw it into the cauldrons of the country, if they have them: these are most like  bowls, except that they are much bigger; they throw the meat into these, then, and cook it by lighting a fire beneath with the bones of the victims. But if they have no cauldron, then they put all the meat into the victims' stomachs, adding water, and make a fire of the bones beneath,\n\nwhich burn nicely; the stomachs easily hold the meat when it is stripped from the bones; thus a steer serves to cook itself, and every other victim does likewise. When the flesh is cooked, the sacrificer takes the first-fruits of the flesh and the entrails and casts them before him. They use all grazing animals for sacrifice, but mainly horses.\n\n\nThis is their way of sacrificing to other gods and these are the beasts offered; but their sacrifices to  are of this sort. Every district in each of the governments has a structure sacred to ; namely, a pile of bundles of sticks three eighths of a mile wide and long, but of a lesser height, on the top of which there is a flattened four-sided surface; three of its sides are sheer, but the fourth can be ascended.\nEvery year a hundred and fifty wagon-loads of sticks are heaped upon this; for the storms of winter always make it sink down. On this sacred pile an ancient scimitar of iron is set for each people: their image of . They bring yearly sacrifice of sheep and goats and horses to this scimitar, offering to these symbols even more than they do to the other gods.\nOf enemies that they take alive, they sacrifice one man in every hundred, not as they sacrifice sheep and goats, but differently. They pour wine on the men's heads and cut their throats over a bowl; then they carry the blood up on to the pile of sticks and pour it on the scimitar.\nThey carry the blood up above, but down below by the sacred pile they cut off all the slain men's right arms and hands and throw these into the air, and depart when they have sacrificed the rest of the victims; the arm lies where it has fallen, and the body apart from it.\n\n\nThese then are their established rites of sacrifice; but these  make no offerings of swine; nor are they willing for the most part to rear them in their country.\n\n\nAs to war, these are their customs. A  drinks the blood of the first man whom he has taken down. He carries the heads of all whom he has slain in the battle to his king; for if he brings a head, he receives a share of the booty taken, but not otherwise.\nHe scalps the head by making a cut around it by the ears, then grasping the scalp and shaking the head off. Then he scrapes out the flesh with the rib of a steer, and kneads the skin with his hands, and having made it supple he keeps it for a hand towel, fastening it to the bridle of the horse which he himself rides, and taking pride in it; for he who has most scalps for hand towels is judged the best man.\nMany  even make garments to wear out of these scalps, sewing them together like coats of skin. Many too take off the skin, nails and all, from their dead enemies' right hands, and make coverings for their quivers;the human skin was, as it turned out, thick and shining, the brightest and whitest skin of all, one might say.\nMany flay the skin from the whole body, too, and carry it about on horseback stretched on a wooden frame.\n\n\nThe heads themselves, not all of them but those of their bitterest enemies, they treat this way. Each saws off all the part beneath the eyebrows, and cleans the rest. If he is a poor man, then he covers the outside with a piece of raw hide, and so makes use of it; but if he is rich, he covers the head with the raw hide, and gilds the inside of it and uses it for a drinking-cup.\nSuch a cup a man also makes out of the head of his own kinsman with whom he has been feuding, and whom he has defeated in single combat before the king; and if guests whom he honors visit him he will serve them with these heads, and show how the dead were his kinsfolk who fought him and were beaten by him; this they call manly valor.\n\n\nFurthermore, once a year each governor of a province brews a bowl of wine in his own province, which those  who have slain enemies drink; those who have not achieved this do not taste this wine but sit apart dishonored; and this they consider a very great disgrace; but as many as have slain not one but many enemies have two cups apiece and drink out of both.\n\n\nThere are many diviners among the , who divine by means of many wi!low wands as I will show. They bring great bundles of wands, which they lay on the ground and unfasten, and utter their divinations as they lay the rods down one by one; and while still speaking, they gather up the rods once more and place them together again;\n\nthis manner of divination is hereditary among them. The , who are hermaphrodites, say that  gave them the art of divination, which they practise by means of lime-tree bark. They cut this bark into three portions, and prophesy while they braid and unbraid these in their fingers.\n\n\nWhenever the king of the  falls ill, he sends for the three most reputable diviners, who prophesy in the aforesaid way; and they generally tell him that such and such a man (naming whoever it may be of the people) has sworn falsely by the king's hearth;\n\nfor when the  will swear their mightiest oath, it is by the king's hearth that they are accustomed to swear. Immediately, the man whom they allege to have sworn falsely is seized and brought in, and when he comes the diviners accuse him, saying that their divination shows him to have sworn falsely by the king's hearth, and that this is the cause of the king's sickness; and the man vehemently denies that he has sworn falsely.\nWhen he denies it, the king sends for twice as many diviners: and if they too, consulting their art, prove him guilty of perjury, then he is instantly beheaded, and his goods are divided among the first diviners;\n\nbut if the later diviners acquit him, then other diviners come, and yet again others. If the greater number of them acquit the man, it is decreed that the first diviners themselves be put to death.\n\n\nAnd this is how they die. Men yoke oxen to a wagon laden with sticks and tie the diviners up in these, fettering their legs and binding their hands behind them and gagging them; then they set fire to the sticks and drive the oxen away, stampeding them.\nOften the oxen are burnt to death with the diviners, and often the yoke-pole of their wagon is burnt through and the oxen escape with a scorching. They burn their diviners for other reasons, too, in the way described, calling them false prophets.\nWhen the king puts them to death, he does not leave the sons alive either, but kills all the males of the family; the females he does not harm.\n\n\nAs for giving sworn pledges to those who are to receive them, this is the  way: they take blood from the parties to the agreement by making a little cut in the body with an awl or a knife, and pour it mixed with wine into a big earthenware bowl, into which they then dip a scimitar and arrows and an axe and a javelin; and when this is done those swearing the agreement, and the most honorable of their followers, drink the blood after solemn curses.\n\n\nThe burial-places of the kings are in the land of the , which is the end of the navigation of the . Whenever their king has died, the  dig a great four-cornered pit in the ground there; when this is ready, they take up the dead manhis body enclosed in wax, his belly cut open and cleaned and filled with cut marsh-plants and frankincense, and parsley and anise seed, and sewn up againand transport him on a wagon to another tribe.\nThen those who receive the dead man on his arrival do the same as do the Royal : that is, they cut off a part of their ears, shave their heads, make cuts around their arms, tear their foreheads and noses, and pierce their left hands with arrows.\nFrom there, the escorts transport the king's body on the wagon to another of the tribes that they rule, and those to whom they have already come follow them; and having carried the dead man to all in turn, they are at the place of burial, in the country of the , the farthest distant tribe of all under their rule.\nThen, having laid the body on a couch in the tomb, they plant spears on each side of the body and lay wooden planks across them, which they then roof over with braided osiers; in the open space which is left in the tomb they bury one of the king's concubines, his cupbearer, his cook, his groom, his squire, and his messenger, after strangling them, besides horses, and first-fruits of everything else, and golden cups; for the  do not use silver or bronze.\nHaving done this, they all build a great barrow of earth, vying eagerly with one another to make this as great as possible.\n\n\nAfter a year has past, they next do as follows. They take the most trusted of the rest of the king's servants (and these are native-born , for only those whom he tells to do so serve the king, and none of the  have servants bought by money)\n\nand strangle fifty of these and fifty of their best horses and empty and clean the bellies of them all, fill them with chaff, and sew them up again.\nThen they fasten half of a wheel to two posts, the hollow upward, and the other half to another pair of posts, until many posts thus prepared are planted in the ground, and, after driving thick stakes lengthways through the horses' bodies to their necks, they place the horses up on the wheels\n\nso that the wheel in front supports the horse's forequarters and the wheel behind takes the weight of the belly by the hindquarters, and the forelegs and hindlegs hang free; and putting bridles and bits in the horses' mouths, they stretch the bridles to the front and fasten them with pegs.\nThen they take each one of the fifty strangled young men and mount him on the horse; their way of doing it is to drive an upright stake through each body passing up alongside the spine to the neck leaving enough of the stake projecting below to be fixed in a hole made in the other stake, which passes through the horse. So having set horsemen of this fashion around the tomb, they ride away.\n\n\nThis is the way they bury their kings. All other , when they die, are laid in wagons and carried about among their friends by their nearest of kin; each receives them and entertains the retinue hospitably, setting before the dead man about as much of the fare as he serves to the rest. All but the kings are carried about like this for forty days and then buried.\nAfter the burial the  cleanse themselves as follows: they anoint and wash their heads and, for their bodies, set up three poles leaning together to a point and cover these over with wool mats; then, in the space so enclosed to the best of their ability, they make a pit in the center beneath the poles and the mats and throw red-hot stones into it.\n\n\nThey have hemp growing in their country, very like flax, except that the hemp is much thicker and taller. This grows both of itself and also by their cultivation, and the  even make garments of it which are very like linen; no one, unless he were an expert in hemp, could determine whether they were hempen or linen; whoever has never seen hemp before will think the garment linen.\n\n\nThe  then take the seed of this hemp and, crawling in under the mats, throw it on the red-hot stones, where it smoulders and sends forth such fumes that no  vapor-bath could surpass it.\nThe  howl in their joy at the vapor-bath. This serves them instead of bathing, for they never wash their bodies with water.\nBut their women pound cypress and cedar and frankincense wood on a rough stone, adding water also, and with the thick stuff thus pounded they anoint their bodies and faces, as a result of which not only does a fragrant scent come from them, but when on the second day they take off the ointment, their skin becomes clear and shining.\n\n\nBut as regards foreign customs, the  (like others) very much shun practising those of any other country, and particularly of , as was proved in the case of  and also of .\nFor when  was coming back to the  country after having seen much of the world in his travels and given many examples of his wisdom, he sailed through the  and put in at ;\n\nwhere, finding the  celebrating the feast of the Mother of the Gods with great ceremony, he vowed to this same Mother that if he returned to his own country safe and sound he would sacrifice to her as he saw the  doing, and establish a nightly rite of worship.\nSo when he came to , he hid himself in the country called Woodland (which is beside the Race of , and is all overgrown with every kind of timber); hidden there,  celebrated the goddess' ritual with exactness, carrying a small drum and hanging images about himself.\nThen some  saw him doing this and told the king, ; who, coming to the place himself and seeing  performing these rites, shot an arrow at him and killed him. And now the , if they are asked about , say they have no knowledge of him; this is because he left his country for  and followed the customs of strangers.\nBut according to what I heard from , the deputy for ,  was an uncle of  king of , and he was the son of , son of , son of . Now if  was truly of this family, then let him know he was slain by his own brother; for  was the son of , and it was  who killed .\n\n\nIt is true that I have heard another story told by the ; namely, that  had been sent by the king of  and had been a student of the ways of , and after his return told the king who sent him that all  were keen for every kind of learning, except the ; but that these were the only  who spoke and listened with discretion.\nBut this is a tale pointlessly invented by the  themselves; and be this as it may, the man was put to death as I have said.\n\n\nThis, then, was how  fared, owing to his foreign ways and consorting with ; and a great many years afterward, , son of , suffered a like fate.  was one of the sons born to , king of ; but his mother was of , and not native-born; and she taught him to speak and read .\nAs time passed,  was treacherously killed by , king of the , and  inherited the kingship and his father's wife, a  woman whose name was , and she bore  a son, .\nSo  was king of ; but he was in no way content with the  way of life, and was much more inclined to  ways, from the upbringing that he had received. So this is what he would do: he would lead the  army to the city of the  (who say that they are ), and when he arrived there would leave his army in the suburb of the city,\n\nwhile he himself, entering within the walls and shutting the gates, would take off his  apparel and put on  dress; and in it he would go among the townsfolk unattended by spearmen or any others (who would guard the gates, lest any  see him wearing this apparel), and in every way follow the  manner of life, and worship the gods according to  usage.\nWhen he had spent a month or more like this, he would put on  dress and leave the city. He did this often; and he built a house in , and married a wife of the people of the country and brought her there.\n\n\nBut when things had to turn out badly for him, they did so for this reason: he conceived a desire to be initiated into the rites of the ; and when he was about to begin the sacred mysteries, he saw the greatest vision.\nHe had in the city of the  a spacious house, grand and costly (the same house I just mentioned), all surrounded by sphinxes and griffins worked in white marble; this house was struck by a thunderbolt. And though the house burnt to the ground,  none the less performed the rite to the end.\nNow the  reproach the  for this Bacchic revelling, saying that it is not reasonable to set up a god who leads men to madness.\nSo when  had been initiated into the Bacchic rite, some one of the  scoffed at the : You laugh at us, , because we play the Bacchant and the god possesses us; but now this deity has possessed your own king, so that he plays the Bacchant and is maddened by the god. If you will not believe me, follow me now and I will show him to you.\nThe leading men among the  followed him, and the  brought them up secretly onto a tower; from which, when  passed by with his company of worshippers, they saw him playing the Bacchant; thinking it a great misfortune, they left the city and told the whole army what they had seen.\n\n\nAfter this  rode off to his own place; but the  rebelled against him, setting up his brother , son of the daughter of , for their king.\n\n, learning what had happened concerning him and the reason why it had happened, fled into ; and when  heard this he led his army there. But when he was beside the , the  barred his way; and when the armies were about to engage,  sent this message to :\n\nWhy should we try each other's strength? You are my sister's son, and you have my brother with you; give him back to me, and I will give up your  to you; and let us not endanger our armies.\nSuch was the offer  sent to him; for ' brother had fled from him and was with . The  agreed to this, and took his brother , giving up his own uncle to .\n\n then took his brother and carried him away, but  beheaded  on the spot. This is how closely the  guard their customs, and these are the penalties they inflict on those who add foreign customs to their own.\n\n\nHow numerous the  are, I was not able to learn exactly, and the accounts that I heard did not tally, some saying that they are very numerous, and some that they are few, so far as they are true .\nBut this much they let me see for myself: there is a region between the  and  rivers, whose name is ; this is the land that I mentioned when I said that there is a spring of salt water in it, whose water makes the  unfit to drink.\nIn this region is a bronze vessel, as much as six times greater than the cauldron dedicated by  son of  at the entrance of the .\nFor anyone who has not yet seen the latter, I will make my meaning plain: the  bronze vessel easily contains five thousand four hundred gallons, and it is of six fingers' thickness. This vessel (so the people of the country said) was made out of arrowheads.\nFor their king, whose name was , desiring to know the census of the , commanded every  to bring him the point from an arrow, threatening death to all who did not.\nSo a vast number of arrow-heads was brought, and he decided to make and leave a memorial out of them; and he made of these this bronze vessel, and set it up in this country . This much I heard about the number of the .\n\n\nAs for marvels, there are none in the land, except that it has by far the greatest and the most numerous rivers in the world; and over and above the rivers and the great extent of the plains there is one most marvellous thing for me to mention: they show a footprint of  by the  stamped on rock, like the mark of a man's foot, but forty inches in length. Having described this, I will now return to the story which I began to tell.\n\n\nWhile  was making preparations against the , and sending messengers to direct some to furnish infantry and some to furnish ships, and others again to bridge the , , son of  and ' brother, by no means wanted him to make an expedition against the , telling him how hard that people were to deal with.\nBut when, for all his good advice, he could not deter the king,  ceased to advise, and , all his preparations made, led his army from .\n\n\nThen the  , who had three sons, all with the army, asked  that one be left behind. You are my friend, said the king, and your request is reasonable; I will leave all your sons.\n\n was very happy, supposing his sons released from service; but  told those whose job it was to execute all of ' sons. So their throats were cut, and they were left there.\n\n\nBut , when he came to that place in his march from  where the  was bridged in the territory of , went aboard ship and sailed to the  (as they are called), which the  say formerly moved; there, he sat on a headland and viewed the , a marvellous sight.\nFor it is the most wonderful sea of all. Its length is eleven thousand one hundred stades, and its breadth three thousand three hundred stades at the place where it is widest.\nThe channel at the entrance of this sea is four stades across; the narrow neck of the channel, called , across which the bridge was thrown, is about one hundred and twenty stades long. The  reaches as far as to the ;\n\nand the  is five hundred stades wide and one thousand four hundred long; its outlet is the , which is no wider than seven stades and four hundred long. The  empties into a gulf of the sea which we call .\n\n\nThese measurements have been made in this way: a ship will generally accomplish seventy thousand orguiae  in a long day's voyage, and sixty thousand by night.\nThis being granted, seeing that from the ' mouth to the  (which is the greatest length of the sea) it is a voyage of nine days and eight nights, the length of it will be one million one hundred and ten thousand orguiai, which make eleven thousand stades.\nFrom the  region to  on the  (the greatest width of the ) it is a voyage of three days and two nights; that is, of three hundred and thirty thousand orguiai, or three thousand three hundred stades.\nThus have I measured the  and the  and , and they are as I have said. Furthermore, a lake is seen issuing into the  and not much smaller than the sea itself; it is called the , and the mother of the .\n\n\nAfter having viewed the ,  sailed back to the bridge, whose architect was  of ; and when he had viewed the  also, he set up two pillars of white marble by it, engraving on the one in  and on the other in  characters the names of all the nations that were in his army: all the nations subject to him. The full census of these, over and above the fleet, was seven hundred thousand men, including horsemen, and the number of ships assembled was six hundred.\nThese pillars were afterward carried by the  into their city and there used to build the altar of  , except for one column covered with  writing that was left beside the temple of  at . Now if my reckoning is correct, the place where king  bridged the  was midway between  and the temple at the entrance of the sea.\n\n\nAfter this, being pleased with his bridge of boats,  made a gift of ten of everything to  the , the architect of it;  took the first-fruits of these and had a picture made with them, showing the whole bridge of the , and  sitting aloft on his throne and his army crossing; he set this up in the temple of , with this inscription:\n\n\n\nThis memorialized the builder of the bridge.\n\n\n, after rewarding , crossed over to ; he had told the  to sail into the  as far as the , and when they got to the , to wait there for him, bridging the river meanwhile; for the fleet was led by  and  and men of the .\nSo the fleet passed between the  and sailed straight for the  and, after a two days' voyage up the river from the sea, set about bridging the narrow channel of the river where its various mouths separate.\nBut , passing over the  on the floating bridge of ships, journeyed through  to the sources of the , where he camped for three days.\n\n\nThe  is said by those living on it to be the best river of all for purposes of healing, especially for healing mange in men and horses. Its springs are thirty-eight in number, some cold and some hot, all flowing from the same rock.\nThere are two roads to the place, one from the town of  near , one from  on the ; each is a two days' journey. This  is a tributary of the , and that of the , and that of the , which empties into the sea near the city of .\n\n\nHaving come to this river and camped there, then,  was pleased with the sight of it, and set up yet another pillar there, cut with this inscription:\n\nFrom the headwaters of the river  flows the best and finest water of all; and to them came, leading an army against the , the best and finest man of all,  son of , king of  and all the continent. Such was the inscription.\n\n\nFrom there,  set out and came to another river called , which flows through the country of the ; and having reached this river, he pointed out a spot to the army, and told every man to lay one stone as he passed in this spot that he pointed out. After his army did this, he led it away, leaving behind there great piles of stones.\n\n\nBut before he came to the , he first took the , who pretend to be immortal. The  of  and of the country above the towns of  and , who are called  and , surrendered without a fight to ; but the  resisted stubbornly, and were enslaved at once, the bravest and most just  of all.\n\n\nTheir belief in their immortality is as follows: they believe that they do not die, but that one who perishes goes to the deity , or , as some of them call him.\nOnce every five years they choose one of their people by lot and send him as a messenger to , with instructions to report their needs; and this is how they send him: three lances are held by designated men; others seize the messenger to  by his hands and feet, and swing and toss him up on to the spear-points.\nIf he is killed by the toss, they believe that the god regards them with favor; but if he is not killed, they blame the messenger himself, considering him a bad man, and send another messenger in place of him. It is while the man still lives that they give him the message.\nFurthermore, when there is thunder and lightning these same  shoot arrows skyward as a threat to the god, believing in no other god but their own.\n\n\nI understand from the  who live beside the  and , that this  was a man who was once a slave in , his master being  son of ;\n\nthen, after being freed and gaining great wealth, he returned to his own country. Now the  were a poor and backward people, but this  knew  ways and a more advanced way of life than the ; for he had consorted with , and moreover with one of the greatest  teachers, ;\n\ntherefore he made a hall, where he entertained and fed the leaders among his countrymen, and taught them that neither he nor his guests nor any of their descendants would ever die, but that they would go to a place where they would live forever and have all good things.\nWhile he was doing as I have said and teaching this doctrine, he was meanwhile making an underground chamber. When this was finished, he vanished from the sight of the , and went down into the underground chamber, where he lived for three years,\n\nwhile the  wished him back and mourned him for dead; then in the fourth year he appeared to the , and thus they came to believe what  had told them. Such is the  story about him.\n\n\nNow I neither disbelieve nor entirely believe the tale about  and his underground chamber; but I think that he lived many years before ;\n\nand as to whether there was a man called  or this is some deity native to the , let the question be dismissed.\n\n\nSuch were the ways of the , who were subdued by the  and followed their army. When  and the land army with him had come to the , and all had crossed, he had the  break the bridge and follow him in his march across the mainland, together with the men of the fleet.\nSo the  were preparing to break the bridge and do ' bidding; but Ces son of , the general of the , after first asking if  were willing to listen to advice from one who wanted to give it, said,\n\nSince, O King, you are about to march against a country where you will not find tilled lands or inhabited cities, let this bridge stay where it is, leaving those who made it to guard it.\nThus, if we find the  and do what we want, we have a way of return; and even if we do not find them, at least our way back is safe; for my fear has never been that we shall be overcome by the  in the field, but rather that we may not be able to find them, and so go astray to our harm.\nNow it may perhaps be said that I say this for my own sake, because I want to remain behind; but it is not so; I only declare publicly the opinion that I think best for you, and I will follow you and do not want to be left here.\n\n was very pleased with this advice, and he answered Ces thus: My friend from , do not fail to show yourself to me when I return to my house safe, so that I may make you a good return for your good advice.\n\n\nAfter saying this, he tied sixty knots in a thong, and summoning the  sovereigns to an audience said to them:\n\nGentlemen of , I take back the decision which I delivered before about the bridge; now, take this thong and do as follows. Begin to reckon from the day when you see me march away against the , and untie one knot each day: and if the days marked by the knots have all passed and I have not returned, embark for your own homes.\nBut until then, since the plan is changed, guard the bridge, making every effort to keep and watch it. You will please me very much if you do this. Having said this,  hastened to march further.\n\n\n runs farther out into the sea than ; and  begins where a bay is formed in its coast, and the mouth of the , facing southeast, is in that country.\nNow I am going to describe the coast of the true  from the , and give its measurements. The ancient  land begins at the  and faces south and the south wind, as far as the city called .\nBeyond this place, the country fronting the same sea is hilly and projects into the ; it is inhabited by the  nation as far as what is called the ; and this ends in the eastern sea.\nFor the sea to the south and the sea to the east are two of the four boundary lines of , just as seas are boundaries of ; and the  inhabit a part of  like , as though some other people, not Attic, were to inhabit the heights of  from  to the town of , if  jutted farther out into the sea.\nI mean, so to speak, to compare small things with great. Such a land is the  country. But those who have not sailed along that part of  may understand from this other analogy: it is as though in  some other people, not , were to live on the promontory within a line drawn from the harbor of  to . I am speaking of these two countries, but there are many others of a similar kind that  resembles.\n\n\nBeyond the  country the  begin, living north of the  and beside the eastern sea, west of the  and the , as far as the  river, which empties into the end of that lake.\nNow it has been seen that on its northern and inland side, running from the ,  is bounded first by the , next by the , next by the , and last by the .\n\n\n, then, is a four-sided country, two of whose sides are coastline, the frontiers running inland and those that are by the sea making it a perfect square;\n\nfor it is a ten days' journey from the  to the , and the same from the  to the ; and it is a twenty days' journey from the sea inland to the country of the  who live north of .\nNow, as I reckon a day's journey at two hundred stades, the cross-measurement of  would be a distance of five hundred miles, and the line drawn straight up inland the same. Such then is the extent of this land.\n\n\nConvinced that they alone were not able to repel ' army in open warfare, the  sent messengers to their neighbors, whose kings had already gathered and were deliberating on the presumption that a great army was marching against them.\nThe assembled kings were those of the , , , , , , , and .\n\n\nAmong these, the  have the following customs: all ship-wrecked men, and any  whom they capture in their sea-raids, they sacrifice to the Virgin goddess as I will describe: after the first rites of sacrifice, they strike the victim on the head with a club;\n\naccording to some, they then place the head on a pole and throw the body off the cliff on which their temple stands; others agree as to the head, but say that the body is buried, not thrown off the cliff. The  themselves say that this deity to whom they sacrifice is 's daughter .\nAs for enemies whom they defeat, each cuts his enemy's head off and carries it away to his house, where he places it on a tall pole and stands it high above the dwelling, above the smoke-vent for the most part. These heads, they say, are set up to guard the whole house. The  live by plundering and war.\n\n\nThe  are the most refined of men and especially given to wearing gold. Their intercourse with women is promiscuous, so that they may be consanguine with one another and, all being relations, not harbor jealousy or animosity toward one another. In the rest of their customs they are like the .\n\n\nThe  follow  customs; but one generation before the advent of ' army, they happened to be driven from their country by snakes; for their land produced great numbers of these, and still more came down on them out of the desolation on the north, until at last the  were so afflicted that they left their own country and lived among the . It may be that these people are wizards;\n\nfor the , and the  settled in , say that once a year every one of the  becomes a wolf for a few days and changes back again to his former shape. Those who tell this tale do not convince me; but they tell it nonetheless, and swear to its truth.\n\n\nThe  are the most savage of all men in their way of life; they know no justice and obey no law. They are nomads, wearing a costume like the , but speaking a language of their own; of all these, they are the only people that eat men.\n\n\nThe  all wear black clothing, from which they get their name; their customs are .\n\n\nThe  are a great and populous nation; the eyes of them all are very bright, and they are ruddy. They have a city built of wood, called . The wall of it is three and three quarters miles in length on each side of the city; this wall is high and all of wood; and their houses are wooden, and their temples;\n\nfor there are temples of  gods among them, furnished in  style with images and altars and shrines of wood; and they honor  every two years with festivals and revelry. For the  are by their origin , who left their trading ports to settle among the ; and they speak a language half  and half . But the  do not speak the same language as the , nor is their manner of life the same.\n\n\nThe  are indigenous; they are nomads, and the only people in these parts that eat fir-cones; the  are farmers, eating grain and cultivating gardens; they are altogether unlike the  in form and in coloring. Yet the  call the  too ; but this is wrong.\nTheir whole country is thickly wooded with every kind of tree; in the depth of the forest there is a great, wide lake and a marsh surrounded by reeds; otter is trapped in it, and beaver, besides certain square-faced creatures whose skins are used to trim mantles, and their testicles are used by the people to heal sicknesses of the womb.\n\n\nAbout the , the story is as follows. When the  were at war with the  (whom the  call , a name signifying in our tongue killers of men, for in  a man is oior and to kill is pata), the story runs that after their victory on the  they sailed away carrying in three ships as many  as they had been able to take alive; and out at sea the  attacked the crews and killed them.\nBut they knew nothing about ships, or how to use rudder or sail or oar; and with the men dead, they were at the mercy of waves and winds, until they came to the Cliffs by the ; this place is in the country of the free . The  landed there, and set out on their journey to the inhabited country, and seizing the first troop of horses they met, they mounted them and raided the  lands.\n\n\nThe  could not understand the business; for they did not recognize the women's speech or their dress or their nation, but wondered where they had come from, and imagined them to be men all of the same age; and they met the  in battle. The result of the fight was that the  got possession of the dead, and so came to learn that their foes were women.\nTherefore, after deliberation they resolved by no means to slay them as before, but to send their youngest men to them, of a number corresponding (as they guessed) to the number of the women. They directed these youths to camp near the  and to imitate all that they did; if the women pursued them, not to fight, but to flee; and when the pursuit stopped, to return and camp near them. This was the plan of the , for they desired that children be born of the women. The young men who were sent did as they were directed.\n\n\nWhen the  perceived that the youths meant them no harm, they let them be; but every day the two camps drew nearer to each other. Now the young men, like the , had nothing but their arms and their horses, and lived as did the women, by hunting and plunder.\n\n\nAt midday the  would scatter and go apart from each other singly or in pairs, roaming apart for greater comfort. The  noticed this and did likewise; and as the women wandered alone, a young man laid hold of one of them, and the woman did not resist but let him do his will;\n\nand since they did not understand each other's speech and she could not speak to him, she signed with her hand that he should come the next day to the same place and bring another youth with him (showing by signs that there should be two), and she would bring another woman with her.\nThe youth went away and told his comrades; and the next day he came himself with another to the place, where he found the  and another with her awaiting them. When the rest of the young men learned of this, they had intercourse with the rest of the .\n\n\nPresently they joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife the woman with whom he had had intercourse at first. Now the men could not learn the women's language, but the women mastered the speech of the men;\n\nand when they understood each other, the men said to the , We have parents and possessions; therefore, let us no longer live as we do, but return to our people and be with them; and we will still have you, and no others, for our wives. To this the women replied:\n\nWe could not live with your women; for we and they do not have the same customs. We shoot the bow and throw the javelin and ride, but have never learned women's work; and your women do none of the things of which we speak, but stay in their wagons and do women's work, and do not go out hunting or anywhere else.\nSo we could never agree with them. If you want to keep us for wives and to have the name of fair men, go to your parents and let them give you the allotted share of their possessions, and after that let us go and live by ourselves. The young men agreed and did this.\n\n\nSo when they had been given the allotted share of possessions that fell to them, and returned to the , the women said to them:\n\nWe are worried and frightened how we are to live in this country after depriving you of your fathers and doing a lot of harm to your land.\nSince you propose to have us for wives, do this with us: come, let us leave this country and live across the  river.\n\n\nTo this too the youths agreed; and crossing the , they went a three days' journey east from the river, and a three days' journey north from ; and when they came to the region in which they now live, they settled there.\nEver since then the women of the  have followed their ancient ways; they ride out hunting, with their men or without them; they go to war, and dress the same as the men.\n\n\nThe language of the  is , but not spoken in its ancient purity, since the  never learned it correctly. In regard to marriage, it is the custom that no maiden weds until she has killed a man of the enemy; and some of them grow old and die unmarried, because they cannot fulfill the law.\n\n\nThe kings of the aforesaid nations having gathered, then, the  messengers came and laid everything before them, explaining how the , now that the whole of the other continent was subject to him, had crossed over to their continent by a bridge thrown across the neck of the , and how having crossed it and subjugated the  he was now bridging the , so as to make that whole region subject to him like the others.\n\nBy no means stand aside and let us be destroyed, they said; rather, let us unite and oppose this invader. If you will not, then we shall either be driven out of our country or stay and make terms.\nFor what is to become of us if you will not help us? And afterward it will not be easy for you, either; for the  has come to attack you no less than us, and when he has subjugated us he will not be content to leave you alone.\nWe will give you a convincing proof of what we say: if indeed the  were marching against us alone, wanting vengeance for our former enslavement of his country, he ought to leave others alone and make straight for us, and would show everyone that  and no other country was his goal.\nBut as it is, from the day he crossed over to this continent, he has been taming all that come in his way, and he holds in subjection not only the rest of , but also our neighbors the .\n\n\nAfter the  had made this speech, the kings who had come from the nations deliberated, and their opinions were divided. The kings of the  and the  and the  were of one mind and promised to help the ; but the kings of the  and  and  and  and  gave this answer to the messengers:\n\nHad it not been you who wronged the  first and began the war, what you now ask would seem to us right, and we would listen and act together with you.\nBut as it is, you invaded their land without us and ruled the  for as long as god granted; and the , urged on by the same god, are only repaying you in kind.\nBut we did these men no wrong at that former time, nor do we intend now to wrong them first; but if the  comes against our land too and begins the wrong-doing, then we will not accept it, either; but until we see that, we shall keep to ourselves. For in our judgment the  have not come for us but for those who were the agents of wrong.\n\n\nWhen this answer was brought back to the , they determined not to meet their enemy in the open field, since they could not get the allies that they sought, but rather to fall back driving off their herds, choking the wells and springs on their way and destroying the grass from the earth; and they divided themselves into two companies.\nIt was their decision that to one of their divisions, which  ruled, the  be added; if the  marched that way, this group was to retire before him and fall back toward the  river, by the , and if the  turned to go back, then they were to pursue and attack him. This was one of the divisions of the royal people, and it was appointed to follow this course;\n\ntheir two other divisions, namely, the greater whose ruler was , and the third whose king was , were to unite, and taking with them also the  and , to draw off like the others at the  approach, always keeping one day's march ahead of the enemy, avoiding a confrontation and doing what had been determined.\nFirst, then, they were to retreat in a straight line toward the countries which refused their alliance, so as to involve these, too, in the war; for if they did not of their own accord support the war against the , they must be involved against their will; and after that, the division was to turn back to its own country, and attack the enemy, if in deliberation they thought this best.\n\n\nDetermined on this plan, the  sent an advance guard of their best horsemen to meet ' army. As for the wagons in which their children and wives lived, all these they sent forward, with instructions to drive always northward; and they sent all their flocks with the wagons, keeping none back except what was required for their food.\n\n\nAfter this convoy was first sent on its way, the advance guard of the  found the  about a three days' march distant from the ; and having found them they camped a day's march ahead of the enemy and set about scorching the earth of all living things.\nWhen the  saw the  cavalry appear, they marched on its track, the horsemen always withdrawing before them; and then, making for the one  division, the  held on in pursuit toward the east and the  river;\n\nwhen the horsemen crossed this, the  crossed also, and pursued until they had marched through the land of the  to the land of the .\n\n\nAs long as the  were traversing the  and  territory there was nothing for them to harm, as the land was dry and barren. But when they entered the country of the , they found themselves before the wooden-walled town; the  had abandoned it and left nothing in it, and the  burnt the town.\nThen going forward still on the horsemen's track, they passed through this country into desolation, which is inhabited by no one; it lies to the north of the  and its breadth is a seven days' march.\nBeyond this desolation live the ; four great rivers flow from their country through the land of the , and issue into the lake called the ; their names are , , , .\n\n\nWhen  came into the desolate country, he halted in his pursuit and camped on the , where he built eight great forts, the ruins of which were standing even in my lifetime, all at an equal distance of about seven miles from one another.\nWhile he was occupied with these, the  whom he was pursuing doubled north and turned back into . Then, when they had altogether vanished and were no longer within the ' sight,  left those forts only half finished, and he too doubled about and marched west, thinking that those  were the whole army, and that they were fleeing toward the west.\n\n\nBut when he came by forced marches into , he met the two divisions of the , and pursued them, who always kept a day's march away from him;\n\nand because  would not stop pursuing them, the , according to the plan they had made, fell back before him to the countries of those who had refused their alliance, to the land of the  first.\nThe  and  burst into their land, agitating them; and from there, the  led the  into the country of the , agitating them too; from there, they drew off into the country of the  and, agitating them also, fled to the .\nBut the , seeing their neighbors fleeing panic-stricken at the ' approach, before the  could break into their land sent a herald to forbid them to set foot across their borders, warning the  that if they tried to break through they would have to fight with the  first.\nWith this warning, the  mustered on their borders, intending to stop the invaders. When the  and the  broke into their lands, the  and  and  put up no resistance, but forgot their threats and fled panic-stricken north into the desolate country.\nBut warned off by the , the  made no second attempt on that country, but led the  from the lands of the  into .\n\n\nAs this went on for a long time and did not stop,  sent a horseman to  the  king, with this message: You crazy man, why do you always run, when you can do otherwise? If you believe yourself strong enough to withstand my power, stand and fight and stop running; but if you know you are the weaker, then stop running like this and come to terms with your master, bringing gifts of earth and water.\n\n\n the  king replied: It is like this with me, : I never ran from any man before out of fear, and I am not running from you now; I am not doing any differently now than I am used to doing in time of peace, too.\nAs to why I do not fight with you at once, I will tell you why. We  have no towns or cultivated land, out of fear for which, that the one might be taken or the other wasted, we would engage you sooner in battle. But if all you want is to come to that quickly, we have the graves of our fathers.\nCome on, find these and try to destroy them: you shall know then whether we will fight you for the graves or whether we will not fight. Until then, unless we have reason, we will not engage with you.\nAs to fighting, enough; as to masters, I acknowledge  my forefather and  queen of the  only. As for you, instead of gifts of earth and water I shall send such as ought to come to you; and for your boast that you are my master, I say Weep! Such is the proverbial  speech.\n\n\nSo the herald went to carry this message to ; but the  kings were filled with anger when they heard the word slavery.\nThey then sent the division of the  to which the  were attached, and which was led by , to speak with those  guarding the bridge over the ; as for those of the  who remained behind, it was decided that they should no longer decoy the , but attack them whenever they were foraging for provision. So they watched for the time when ' men were foraging, and did as they had planned.\nThe  horse always routed the  horse, and when the  cavalry would fall back in flight on their infantry, the infantry would come up to their aid; and the , once they had driven in the horse, turned back for fear of the infantry. The  attacked in this fashion by night as well as by day.\n\n\nVery strange to say, what aided the  and thwarted the  in their attacks on ' army was the braying of the asses and the appearance of the mules.\nFor, as I have before indicated,  produces no asses or mules; and there is not in most of  an ass or a mule, because of the cold. Therefore the asses frightened the  horses when they brayed loudly;\n\nand often, when they were in the act of charging the , the horses would shy in fear if they heard the asses bray or would stand still with ears erect, never having heard a noise like it or seen a like creature.\n\n\nThe  thus gained very little in the war, for when the  saw that the  were shaken, they formed a plan to have them remain longer in  and, remaining, be distressed by lack of necessities: they would leave some of their flocks behind with the shepherds, moving away themselves to another place; and the  would come and take the sheep, and be encouraged by this achievement.\n\n\nAfter such a thing had happened several times,  was finally at a loss; and when they perceived this, the  kings sent a herald to  with the gift of a bird, a mouse, a frog, and five arrows.\nThe  asked the bearer of these gifts what they meant; but he said that he had only been told to give the gifts and then leave at once; he told the  to figure out what the presents meant themselves, if they were smart enough.\n\n\nWhen they heard this, the  deliberated. ' judgment was that the  were surrendering themselves and their earth and their water to him; for he reasoned that a mouse is a creature found in the earth and eating the same produce as men, and a frog is a creature of the water and a bird particularly like a horse; and the arrows signified that the  surrendered their fighting power.\nThis was the opinion declared by ; but the opinion of , one of the seven who had slain the , was contrary to it. He reasoned that the meaning of the gifts was,\n\nUnless you become birds, , and fly up into the sky, or mice and hide in the earth, or frogs and leap into the lakes, you will be shot by these arrows and never return home.\n\n\nThe  reasoned thus about the gifts. But when the first division of the  came to the bridgethe division that had first been appointed to stand on guard by the  and had now been sent to the  to speak with the they said,\n\n, we have come to bring you freedom, if you will only listen to us. We understand that  has directed you to guard the bridge for sixty days only, and if he does not come within that time, then to go away to your homes.\nNow then, do what will leave you guiltless in his eyes as in ours: stay here for the time appointed; and after that, leave. So the  promised to do this, and the  made their way back with all haste.\n\n\nBut after sending the gifts to , the  who had remained there came out with foot and horse and offered battle to the . But when the  ranks were set in order, a rabbit ran out between the armies; and every  that saw it gave chase. So there was confusion and shouting among the ;  asked about the clamor among the enemy; and when he heard that they were chasing a rabbit, he said to those with whom he was accustomed to speak,\n\nThese men hold us in deep contempt; and I think now that ' opinion of the  gifts was true. Since, then, my own judgment agrees with his, we need to consider carefully how we shall return safely. To this  said : O King, I understood almost by reason alone how difficult it would be to deal with these ; but when I came here, I understood even better, watching them toying with us.\nNow then, my advice is that at nightfall we kindle our campfires in the usual way, deceive those in our army who are least fit to endure hardship, and tether all our asses here, and ourselves depart, before the  can march straight to the  to break up the bridge, or the  take some action by which we may well be ruined.\n\n\nThis was ' advice, and at nightfall  followed it. He left the men who were worn out, and those whose loss mattered least to him, there in the camp, and all the asses, too, tethered.\nHis reasons for leaving the asses, and the infirm among his soldiers, were the following: the asses, so that they would bray; the men, who were left because of their infirmity, he pretended were to guard the camp while he attacked the  with the fit part of his army.\nGiving this order to those who were left behind, and lighting campfires,  made all haste to reach the . When the asses found themselves deserted by the multitude, they brayed the louder for it; and the  heard them and assumed that the  were in the place.\n\n\nBut when it was day, the men left behind perceived that  had betrayed them, and they held out their hands to the  and explained the circumstances; they, when they heard this, assembled their power in haste, the two divisions of their horde and the one division that was with the  and  and , and made straight for the  in pursuit of the .\nAnd as the  army was for the most part infantry and did not know the roads (which were not marked), while the  were horsemen and knew the short cuts, they went wide of each other, and the  reached the bridge long before the .\nThere, perceiving that the  had not yet come, they said to the , who were in their ships, , the days have exceeded the number, and you are wrong to be here still.\nSince it was fear that kept you here, now break the bridge in haste and go, free and happy men, thanking the gods and the . The one that was your master we shall impress in such a way that he will never lead an army against anyone again.\n\n\nThen the  held a council.  the , general and sovereign of the  of the , advised that they do as the  said and set  free.\nBut  of  advised the opposite. He said, It is owing to  that each of us is sovereign of his city; if ' power is overthrown, we shall no longer be able to rule, I in  or any of you elsewhere; for all the cities will choose democracy rather than despotism.\nWhen  explained this, all of them at once inclined to his view, although they had first sided with .\n\n\nThose high in ' favor who gave their vote were  of ,  of ,  of ,  of ,  of ,  of ,\n\nall from the  and sovereigns of cities there; and from ,  of ,  of ,  of , and  of  who opposed the plan of . As for the , their only notable man present was  of .\n\n\nWhen these accepted ' view, they decided to act upon it in the following way: to break as much of the bridge on the  side as a bowshot from there carried, so that they seem to be doing something when in fact they were doing nothing, and that the  not try to force their way across the bridge over the ; and to say while they were breaking the portion of the bridge on the  side, that they would do all that the  desired.\nThis was the plan they adopted; and then  answered for them all, and said, You have come with good advice, , and your urgency is timely: you guide us well and we do you a convenient service; for, as you see, we are breaking the bridge, and will be diligent about it, as we want to be free.\nBut while we are breaking the bridge, this is your opportunity to go and find the , and when you have found them, punish them as they deserve on our behalf and on your own.\n\n\nSo the , trusting the ' word once more, turned back to look for the ; but they missed the way by which their enemies returned. The  themselves were to blame for this, because they had destroyed the horses' pasturage in that region and blocked the wells.\nHad they not done, they could, if they had wished, easily have found the . But as it was, that part of their plan which they had thought the best was the very cause of their going astray.\nSo the  went searching for their enemies through the parts of their own country where there was forage for the horses and water, supposing that they, too, were heading for such places in their flight; but the  kept to their own former tracks, and so with much trouble they found the crossing.\nBut as they arrived at night and found the bridge broken, they were in great alarm lest the  had abandoned them.\n\n\nThere was an  with  whose voice was the loudest in the world;  had this man stand on the bank of the  and call to  the . This the  did;  heard and answered the first shout, and sent all the ships to ferry the army over, and repaired the bridge.\n\n\nThus the  escaped. The  sought the , but missed them again. Their judgment of the  is that if they are regarded as free men they are the basest and most craven in the world; but if they are reckoned as slaves, none love their masters more, or desire less to escape. Thus have the  taunted the .\n\n\n marched through  to  on the ; from there, he crossed over with his ships to , leaving  as his commander in , a  whom he once honored by saying among the  what I note here:\n\n was about to eat pomegranates, and no sooner had he opened the first of them than his brother  asked him what he would like to have as many of as there were seeds in his pomegranate; then  said that he would rather have that many men like  than make all  subject to him.\nBy speaking thus among , the king honored ; and now he left him behind as his commander, at the head of eighty thousand of his army.\n\n\nThis  is forever remembered by the people of the  for replying,\n\nwhen he was told at  that the people of  had founded their town seventeen years before the  had founded theirs, that the  must at that time have been blind, for had they not been, they would never have chosen the worse site for their city when they might have had the better.\nThis , left now as commander in the country, subjugated all the people of the  who did not take the side of the .\n\n\nAt the same time that he was doing this, another great force was sent against , for the reason that I shall give after I finish the story that I am going to tell now.\nThe descendants of the crew of the  were driven out by the  who carried off the  women from ; after being driven out of  by them, they sailed away to , and there camped on  and kindled a fire.\nSeeing it, the  sent a messenger to inquire who they were and where they came from. They answered the messenger that they were , descendants of the heroes who had sailed in the  and put in at  and there begot their race.\nHearing the story of the lineage of the , the  sent a second time and asked why they had come into  and kindled a fire. They replied that, having been expelled by the , they had come to the land of their fathers, as was most just; and their wish was to live with their fathers' people, sharing in their rights and receiving allotted pieces of land.\nThe  were happy to receive the  on the terms which their guests desired; the chief cause of their consenting was that the  had been in the ship's company of the ; so they received the  and gave them land and distributed them among their own tribes. The  immediately married, and gave in marriage to others the women they had brought from .\n\n\nBut in no time these  became imperious, demanding an equal right to the kingship, and doing other impious things;\n\nhence the  resolved to kill them, and they seized them and cast them into prison. (When the  execute, they do it by night, never by day.)\nNow when they were about to kill the prisoners, the wives of the , who were natives of the country, daughters of leading , asked permission to enter the prison and each converse with her husband; the  granted this, not expecting that there would be any treachery from them.\nBut when the wives came into the prison, they gave their husbands all their own garments, and themselves put on the men's clothing; so the  passed out in the guise of women dressed in women's clothing; and thus escaping, once more camped on .\n\n\nNow, about this same time, , a descendant of  through , , and , was preparing to lead out colonists from .\nThis  was of the line of  and was an uncle on their mother's side to ' sons  and ; and while these boys were yet children he held the royal power of  as regent;\n\nbut when his nephews grew up and became kings, then  could not endure to be a subject when he had had a taste of supreme power, and said he would no longer stay in  but would sail away to his family.\nOn the island now called , but then , there were descendants of  the son of , a ; for  son of  had put in at the place now called  during his search for ; and having put in, either because the land pleased him, or because for some other reason he desired to do so, he left on this island his own relation  together with other .\nThese dwelt on the island of  for eight generations before  came from .\n\n\nIt was these that  was preparing to join, taking with him a company of people from the tribes; his intention was to settle among the people of  and not drive them out but claim them as in fact his own people.\nSo when the  escaped from prison and camped on , and the  were planning to put them to death,  interceded for their lives, that there might be no killing, promising to lead them out of the country himself.\nThe  consented to this, and  sailed with three thirty-oared ships to join the descendants of , taking with him not all the  but only a few;\n\nfor the greater part of them made their way to the lands of the  and , and after having driven these out of their own country, they divided themselves into six companies and established the cities of , , , , , and  in the land they had won; most of these were in my time taken and sacked by the . As for the island , it was called  after its colonist.\n\n\nBut as ' son would not sail with him, his father said that he would leave him behind as a sheep among wolves; after which saying the boy got the nickname of , and it so happened that this became his customary name. He had a son, , from whom the , a great  clan, take their name.\nThe men of this clan, finding that none of their children lived, set up a temple of the avenging spirits of  and , by the instruction of an oracle, after which their children lived. It fared thus, too, with the children of the  at .\n\n\nSo far in the story the  and  records agree; for the rest, we have only the word of the .\n\n son of , king of , a descendant of this same , came to  bringing a hecatomb from his city; among others of his people,  son of  came with him, a descendant of  of the  clan.\nWhen  king of  asked the oracle about other matters, the priestess' answer was that he should found a city in . Lord, I am too old and heavy to stir; command one of these younger men to do this, answered , pointing to  as he spoke.\nNo more was said then. But when they departed, they neglected to obey the oracle, since they did not know where  was, and were afraid to send a colony out to an uncertain destination.\n\n\nFor seven years after this there was no rain in ; all the trees in the island except one withered. The  inquired at  again, and the priestess mentioned the colony they should send to .\nSo, since there was no remedy for their ills, they sent messengers to  to find any  or traveller there who had travelled to . In their travels about the island, these came to the town of , where they met a murex fisherman named , who told them that he had once been driven off course by winds to , to an island there called .\nThey hired this man to come with them to ; from there, just a few men were sent aboard ship to spy out the land first; guided by  to the aforesaid island , these left him there with provision for some months, and themselves sailed back with all speed to  to bring news of the island.\n\n\nBut after they had been away for longer than the agreed time, and  had no provisions left, a  ship sailing for , whose captain was , was driven off her course to , where the  heard the whole story from  and left him provisions for a year;\n\nthey then put out to sea from the island and would have sailed to , but an easterly wind drove them from their course, and did not abate until they had passed through the Pillars of  and came providentially to .\nNow this was at that time an untapped market; hence, the , of all the  whom we know with certainty, brought back from it the greatest profit on their wares except  of , son of ; no one could compete with him.\nThe  took six talents, a tenth of their profit, and made a bronze vessel with it, like an  cauldron, with griffins' heads projecting from the rim all around; they set this up in their temple of , supporting it with three colossal kneeling figures of bronze, each twelve feet high.\nWhat the  had done was the beginning of a close friendship between them and the men of  and .\n\n\nAs for the , when they came to  after leaving  on the island, they brought word that they had established a settlement on an island off . The  determined to send out men from their seven regions, taking by lot one of every pair of brothers, and making  leader and king of all. Then they manned two fifty-oared ships and sent them to .\n\n\nThis is what the  say; and now begins the part in which the  and  stories agree, but not until now, for the  tell a wholly different story about , which is this. There is a town in  called , of which one  became ruler. He was a widower with a daughter whose name was , and he married a second wife.\nWhen the second wife came into his house, she thought fit to be the proverbial stepmother to , ill-treating her and devising all sorts of evil against her; at last she accused the girl of lewdness, and persuaded her husband that the charge was true. So  was persuaded by his wife and contrived a great sin against his daughter.\nThere was at  a  trader, one ;  made this man his guest and friend, and got him to swear that he would do him whatever service he desired; then he gave the man his own daughter, telling him to take her away and throw her into the sea.\nBut  was very angry at being thus tricked on his oath and renounced his friendship with ; presently, he took the girl and sailed away, and so as to fulfill the oath that he had sworn to , when he was on the high seas he bound her with ropes and let her down into the sea and drew her up again, and presently arrived at .\n\n\nThere , a notable , took  and made her his concubine. In time, a son of weak and stammering speech was born to him, to whom he gave the name , as the  and  say; but in my opinion the boy was given some other name,\n\nand changed it to  on his coming to , taking this new name because of the oracle given to him at  and the honorable office which he received. For the  word for king is , and this (I believe) is why the  priestess called him so in her prophecy, using a  name because she knew that he was to be king in .\nFor when he grew to adulthood, he went to  to inquire about his voice; and the priestess in answer gave him this:\n\njust as if she addressed him using the  word for king, Basileus, you have come for a voice, et cetera.\nBut he answered: Lord, I came to you to ask about my speech; but you talk of other matters, things impossible to do; you tell me to plant a colony in ; where shall I get the power or strength of hand for it?  spoke thus, but as the god would not give him another oracle and kept answering as before, he departed while the priestess was still speaking, and went away to .\n\n\nBut afterward things turned out badly for  and the rest of the ; and when, ignorant of the cause of their misfortunes, they sent to  to ask about their present ills,\n\nthe priestess declared that they would fare better if they helped  plant a colony at  in . Then the  sent  with two fifty-oared ships; these sailed to , but, not knowing what else to do, presently returned to .\nThere, the  shot at them as they came to land and would not let the ship put in, telling them to sail back; which they did under constraint of necessity, and planted a colony on an island off the  coast called (as I have said already) . This island is said to be as big as the city of  is now.\n\n\nHere they lived for two years; but as everything went wrong, the rest sailed to  leaving one behind, and on their arrival questioned the oracle, and said that they were living in , but that they were no better off for that.\nThen the priestess gave them this reply:\n\nHearing this,  and his men sailed back again; for the god would not let them do anything short of colonizing  itself;\n\nand having come to the island and taken aboard the one whom they had left there, they made a settlement at a place in  itself, opposite the island which was called . This is a place enclosed on both sides by the fairest of groves, with a river flowing along one side of it.\n\n\nHere they dwelt for six years; but in the seventh, the  got them to leave the place, saying that they would lead them to a better;\n\nand they brought the  from  and led them west, so calculating the hours of daylight that they led the  past the fairest place in their country, called , at night, lest the  see it in their journey.\nThen they brought the  to what is called the Fountain of , and said to them: Here, , it is suitable for you to live; for here the sky is torn.\n\n\nNow in the time of  the founder of the colony, who ruled for forty years, and of his son  who ruled for sixteen, the inhabitants of  were no more in number than when they had first gone out to the colony.\nBut in the time of the third ruler, , who was called the Fortunate, the  priestess warned all  by an oracle to cross the sea and live in  with the ; for the  invited them, promising a distribution of land;\n\nand this was the oracle:\n\n\nSo a great multitude gathered at , and cut out great tracts of land from the territory of the neighboring . Robbed of their lands and treated violently by the , these then sent to  together with their king, whose name was , and put their affairs in the hands of , the king of that country.\n\n mustered a great force of  and sent it against ; the  marched out to  and the  spring, and there fought with the  and beat them;\n\nfor the  had as yet had no experience of , and despised their enemy; as a result of which, they were so utterly destroyed that few of them returned to . Because of this misfortune, and because they blamed him for it, the  revolted from .\n\n\nThis  had a son ; on his first coming to reign, he quarrelled with his brothers, until they left him and went away to another place in , where they founded a city for themselves, which was then and is now called ; and while they were founding it, they persuaded the  to revolt from the .\nThen  led an army into the country of the  who had received his brothers and had also revolted; and they fled in fear of him to the eastern .\n\n pursued them until he came in his pursuit to  in , where the  resolved to attack him; they engaged, and so wholly overcame the  that seven thousand  soldiers were killed there.\nAfter this disaster, , being worn down and having taken a drug, was strangled by his brother ;  was deftly killed by ' wife, .\n\n\n' kingship passed to his son , who was lame and infirm in his feet. The , in view of the affliction that had overtaken them, sent to  to ask what political arrangement would enable them to live best;\n\nthe priestess told them bring a mediator from  in . When the  sent their request, the  gave them their most valued citizen, whose name was .\nWhen this man came to  and learned everything, he divided the people into three tribes; of which the  and dispossessed  were one, the  and  the second, and all the islanders the third; furthermore, he set apart certain domains and priesthoods for their king , but all the rest, which had belonged to the kings, were now to be held by the people in common.\n\n\nDuring the life of this , these ordinances held good, but in the time of his son  much contention arose about the king's rights.\n\n, son of the lame  and , would not abide by the ordinances of , but demanded back the prerogatives of his forefathers, and made himself head of a faction; but he was defeated and banished to , and his mother fled to  in .\nNow  at this time was ruled by , who dedicated that marvellous censer at  which stands in the treasury of the .  came to him, asking him for an army to bring her and her son back to ;\n\n was willing to give her everything else, only not an army, and when she accepted what he gave her, she said that it was fine, but it would be better to give her an army as she asked.\nThis she said whatever the gift, until at last  sent her a golden spindle and distaff, and wool, and when  uttered the same words as before, he answered that these, and not armies, were gifts for women.\n\n\nMeanwhile  was in , collecting all the men that he could and promising them a new division of land; and while a great army was thus gathering, he made a journey to , to ask the oracle about his return.\nThe priestess gave him this answer:\n\n\nThis was the oracle given by the priestess to .\n\n\nBut he returned to  with the men from , and having made himself master of it he forgot the oracle, and demanded justice upon his enemies for his banishment.\nSome of these left the country altogether; others,  seized and sent away to  to be killed there. These were carried off their course to , where the  saved them and sent them to . Others of the  fled for refuge into a great tower that belonged to one , a private man, and  piled wood around it and burnt them there.\nThen, perceiving too late that this was the meaning of the  oracle which forbade him to bake the amphora if he found them in the oven, he deliberately refrained from going into the city of the , fearing the death prophesied and supposing the tidal place to be .\nNow he had a wife who was a relation of his, a daughter of  king of the , and  went to ; but men of  and some of the exiles from  were aware of him and killed him as he walked in the town, and  his father-in-law too. So  whether with or without meaning to missed the meaning of the oracle and fulfilled his destiny.\n\n\nWhile  was living at , accomplishing his own destruction, his mother  held her son's prerogative at , where she administered all his business and sat with others in council.\nBut when she learned of her son's death at , she made her escape to , trusting to the good service which  had done  the son of ; for this was the  who gave  to  and agreed to pay tribute.\nSo, on her arrival in ,  supplicated , asking that he avenge her, on the plea that her son had been killed for allying himself with the .\n\n\nThis  had been appointed viceroy of  by ; at a later day, he was put to death for making himself equal to . For, learning and seeing that  desired to leave a memorial of himself such as no king ever had,  imitated him, until he got his reward;\n\nfor  had coined money out of gold refined to an extreme purity, and , then ruling , made a similar silver coinage; and now there is no silver money so pure as is the . But when  heard that  was doing so, he put him to death, not on this charge but as a rebel.\n\n\nAt this time,  took pity on  and gave her all the  land and sea forces, appointing , a , general of the army, and  of the tribe of the , admiral of the fleet.\nBut before despatching the troops,  sent a herald to  to ask who it was who had killed . The  answered that it was the deed of the whole city, for the many wrongs that  had done them; when he heard this,  sent his troops with .\nThis was the pretext; but I myself think that the troops were sent to subjugate . For the  tribes are many and of different kinds, and though a few of them were the king's subjects, the greater part cared nothing for .\n\n\nNow, concerning the lands inhabited by , the  are the people that live nearest to ; they follow  customs for the most part, but dress like other . Their women wear twisted bronze ornaments on both legs; their hair is long; each catches her own lice, then bites and throws them away.\nThey are the only  that do this, and who show the king all virgins that are to be married; the king then takes the virginity of whichever of these pleases him. These  extend from  to the harbor called .\n\n\nNext to them are the , who inhabit the country to the west as far as the island of ; in between lies the island of , which the  colonized, and on the mainland is the harbor called , and the  which was a settlement of the . Here the country of silphium begins,\n\nwhich reaches from the island of  to the entrance of the . This people is like the others in its customs.\n\n\nThe next people west of the  are the , who live inland of , not coming down to the coast, for that is  territory. These drive four-horse chariots to a greater extent than any other ; it is their practice to imitate most of the  customs.\n\n\nNext west of the  are the , dwelling inland of , and touching the coast at . About the middle of the land of the  lives the little tribe of the , whose territory comes down to the sea at , a town in the  country; their customs are the same as those of the dwellers inland of .\n\n\nNext west of these  is the populous country of the , who in summer leave their flocks by the sea and go up to the land called  to gather dates from the palm-trees that grow there in great abundance and all bear fruit. They hunt locusts, which they dry in the sun, and after grinding sprinkle them into milk and drink it.\nIt is their custom for every man to have many wives; their intercourse with women is promiscuous, as among the ; a staff is placed before the dwelling, and then they have intercourse. When a man of the  weds, on the first night the bride must by custom lie with each of the whole company in turn; and each man after intercourse gives her whatever gift he has brought from his house.\nAs for their manner of swearing and divination, they lay their hands on the graves of the men reputed to have been the most just and good among them, and by these men they swear; their practice of divination is to go to the tombs of their ancestors, where after making prayers they lie down to sleep, and take for oracles whatever dreams come to them.\nThey give and receive pledges by each drinking from the hand of the other party; and if they have nothing liquid, they take the dust of the earth and lick it up.\n\n\nOn the borders of the  is the country of the , who perished in this way: the force of the south wind dried up their water-tanks, and all their country, lying in the region of the , was waterless. After deliberating together, they marched south (I tell the story as it is told by the ), and when they came into the sandy desert, a strong south wind buried them. So they perished utterly, and the  have their country.\n\n\nInland of these to the south, the  live in wild beast country. They shun the sight and fellowship of men, and have no weapons of war, nor know how to defend themselves.\n\n\nThese live inland of the ; the neighboring seaboard to the west is the country of the , who shave their hair to a crest, leaving that on the top of their heads to grow and shaving clean off what is on either side; in war they carry shields made of ostrich skins.\nThe  empties into their sea through their country from a hill called the Hill of the Graces. This hill is thickly wooded, while the rest of  of which I have spoken is bare of trees; it is twenty-five miles from the sea.\n\n\nNext to these  are the , where every woman wears many leather anklets, because (so it is said) she puts on an anklet for every man with whom she has had intercourse; and she who wears the most is reputed to be the best, because she has been loved by the most men.\n\n\nThere is a headland jutting out into the sea from the land of the ; on it live the , whose only fare is the lotus. The lotus fruit is the size of a mastich-berry: it has a sweet taste like the fruit of a date-palm; the  not only eat it, but make wine of it.\n\n\nNext to these along the coast are the , who also use the lotus, but less than the aforesaid people. Their country reaches to a great river called the , which empties into the great , in which is an island called . It is said that the  were told by an oracle to plant a settlement on this island.\n\n\nThe following story is also told: it is said that , when the  had been built at the foot of , put aboard besides a hecatomb a bronze tripod, and set out to sail around the , to go to .\nBut when he was off , a north wind caught and carried him away to ; and before he saw land, he came into the shallows of the . There, while he could find no way out yet,  (the story goes) appeared to him and told  to give him the tripod, promising to show the sailors the channel and send them on their way unharmed.\n\n did, and  then showed them the channel out of the shallows and set the tripod in his own temple; but first he prophesied over it, declaring the whole matter to 's comrades: namely, that should any descendant of the 's crew take away the tripod, then a hundred  cities would be founded on the shores of the . Hearing this (it is said) the  people of the country hid the tripod.\n\n\nNext to these  are the ; these and the , separated by the , live on the shores of the . The  wear their hair long behind, the  in front.\nThey celebrate a yearly festival of , where their maidens are separated into two bands and fight each other with stones and sticks, thus (they say) honoring in the way of their ancestors that native goddess whom we call . Maidens who die of their wounds are called false virgins.\nBefore the girls are set fighting, the whole people choose the fairest maid, and arm her with a  helmet and  panoply, to be then mounted on a chariot and drawn all along the lake shore.\nWith what armor they equipped their maidens before  came to live near them, I cannot say; but I suppose the armor was ; for I maintain that the  took their shield and helmet from .\nAs for , they say that she was daughter of  and the , and that, being for some reason angry at her father, she gave herself to , who made her his own daughter. Such is their tale. The intercourse of men and women there is promiscuous; they do not cohabit but have intercourse like cattle.\nWhen a woman's child is well grown, the men assemble within three months and the child is adjudged to be that man's whom it is most like.\n\n\nI have now described all the nomadic  who live on the coast. Farther inland than these is that  country which is haunted by wild beasts, and beyond this wild beasts' haunt runs a ridge of sand that stretches from \n of  to the Pillars of .\nAt intervals of about ten days' journey along this ridge there are masses of great lumps of salt in hills; on the top of every hill, a fountain of cold sweet water shoots up from the midst of the salt; men live around it who are farthest away toward the desert and inland from the wild beasts' country. The first on the journey from \n, ten days distant from there, are the , who follow the worship of the  of \n; for, as I have said before, the image of  at \n has the head of a ram.\nThey have another spring of water besides, which is warm at dawn, and colder at market-time, and very cold at noon;\n\nand it is then that they water their gardens; as the day declines, the coldness abates, until at sunset the water grows warm. It becomes ever hotter and hotter until midnight, and then it boils and bubbles; after midnight it becomes ever cooler until dawn. This spring is called the Spring of the Sun.\n\n\nAt a distance of ten days' journey again from the  along the sandy ridge, there is a hill of salt like that of the , and springs of water, where men live; this place is called ; it is to this that the  come to gather palm-fruit.\n\n\nAfter ten days' journey again from  there is yet another hill of salt and springs of water and many fruit-bearing palms, as at the other places; men live there called , an exceedingly great nation, who sow in earth which they have laid on the salt.\nThe shortest way to the ' country is from here, thirty days' journey distant. Among the  are the cattle that go backward as they graze, the reason being that their horns curve forward;\n\ntherefore, not being able to go forward, since the horns would stick in the ground, they walk backward grazing. Otherwise, they are like other cattle, except that their hide is thicker and harder to the touch.\nThese  go in their four-horse chariots chasing the cave-dwelling : for the  cave-dwellers are swifter of foot than any men of whom tales are brought to us. They live on snakes and lizards and such-like creeping things. Their speech is like no other in the world: it is like the squeaking of bats.\n\n\nAnother ten days' journey from the  there is again a salt hill and water, where men live called . These are the only men whom we know who have no names; for the whole people are called , but no man has a name of his own.\nWhen the sun is high, they curse and very foully revile him, because his burning heat afflicts their people and their land.\nAfter another ten days' journey there is again a hill of salt, and water, and men living there. Near to this salt is a mountain called Atlas, whose shape is slender and conical; and it is said to be so high that its heights cannot be seen, for clouds are always on them winter and summer. The people of the country call it the pillar of heaven.\nThese men get their name, which is , from this mountain. It is said that they eat no living creature, and see no dreams in their sleep.\n\n\nI know and can tell the names of all the peoples that live on the ridge as far as the , but no farther than that. But I know this, that the ridge reaches as far as the Pillars of  and beyond them.\nThere is a mine of salt on it every ten days' journey, and men live there. Their houses are all built of blocks of the salt; for these are parts of  where no rain falls; for the walls, being of salt, could not stand firm if there were rain.\nThe salt there is both white and purple. Beyond this ridge, the southern and inland parts of  are desolate and waterless: there are no wild beasts, no rain, no forests; this region is wholly without moisture.\n\n\nThus from  to the , the  are nomads that eat meat and drink milk; for the same reason as the  too profess, they will not touch the flesh of cows; and they rear no swine.\nThe women of , too, consider it wrong to eat cows' flesh, because of the  of ; and they even honor her with fasts and festivals; and the  women refuse to eat swine too, as well as cows.\n\n\nThus it is with this region. But west of the  the  are not nomads; they do not follow the same customs, or treat their children as the nomads do.\nFor the practice of many  nomads (I cannot say absolutely whether it is the practice of all) is to take their children when four years old, and to burn the veins of their scalps or sometimes of their temples with grease of sheep's wool, so that the children may never afterward be afflicted by phlegm draining from the head.\nThey say that this makes their children quite healthy. In fact, the  are the healthiest of all men whom we know; whether it is because of this practice, I cannot say absolutely; but they certainly are healthy. When the children smart from the pain of the burning, the  have found a remedy; they soothe them by applications of goats' urine. This is what the  themselves say.\n\n\nThe nomads' way of sacrificing is to cut a piece from the victim's ear for first-fruits and throw it over the house; then they wring the victim's neck. They sacrifice to no gods except the sun and moon; that is, this is the practice of the whole nation; but the dwellers by the  sacrifice to  chiefly, and next to  and .\n\n\nIt would seem that the robe and aegis of the images of  were copied by the  from the  women; for except that  women dress in leather, and that the tassels of their goatskin cloaks are not snakes but thongs of hide, in everything else their equipment is the same.\nAnd in fact, the very name betrays that the attire of the statues of  has come from ; for  women wear the hairless tasselled aegea over their dress, colored with madder, and the  have changed the name of these aegeae into their aegides.\nFurthermore, in my opinion the ceremonial chant first originated in : for the women of that country chant very tunefully. And it is from the  that the  have learned to drive four-horse chariots.\n\n\nThe dead are buried by the nomads in  fashion, except by the . They bury their dead sitting, being careful to make the dying man sit when he releases his spirit, and not die lying supine. Their dwellings are constructed of asphodel stalks twined about reeds; they can be carried here and there. Such are the  customs.\n\n\nWest of the  and next to the  begins the country of  who cultivate the soil and possess houses; they are called ; they wear their hair long on the right side of their heads and shave the left, and they paint their bodies with vermilion.\nThese claim descent from the men who came from . Their country, and the rest of the western part of , is much fuller of wild beasts and more wooded than the country of the nomads.\nFor the eastern region of , which the nomads inhabit, is low-lying and sandy as far as the ; but the land west of this, where the farmers live, is exceedingly mountainous and wooded and full of wild beasts.\nIn that country are the huge snakes and the lions, and the elephants and bears and asps, the horned asses, the dog-headed and the headless men that have their eyes in their chests, as the  say, and the wild men and women, besides many other creatures not fabulous.\n\n\nBut in the nomads' country there are none of these; but there are others, white-rumped antelopes, gazelles, hartebeest, asses, not the horned asses, but those that are called undrinking (for indeed they never drink), the oryx, whose horns are made the horns of the lyre (this is a beast the size of a bull),\n\nfoxes, hyenas, porcupines, wild rams, the dictys, jackals, panthers, the borys, land crocodiles sixty inches long, very like lizards, and ostriches and little one-horned serpents; all these beasts besides those that are elsewhere too, except deer and wild boar; of these two kinds there are none at all in .\nThere are in this country three kinds of mice, the two-footed, the zegeries (this is a  word, meaning in our language hills), and the bristly-haired, as they are called. There are also weasels found in the silphium, very like to the weasels of . So many are the wild creatures of the nomads' country, as far as by our utmost enquiry we have been able to learn.\n\n\nNext to the  of  are the , whose women drive their chariots to war.\n\n\nNext to these are the , where much honey is made by bees, and much more yet (so it is said) by craftsmen. It is certain that they all paint themselves with vermilion and eat apes, with which their mountains swarm.\n\n\nOff their coast (the  say) lies an island called , twenty-five miles long and narrow across, accessible from the mainland; it is full of olives and vines.\nIt is said that there is a lake on this island from which the maidens of the country draw gold-dust out of the mud on feathers smeared with pitch. I do not know whether this is true; I just write what is said. But all things are possible; for I myself saw pitch drawn from the water of a pool in .\nThe pools there are numerous; the greatest of them is seventy feet long and broad, and twelve feet deep. Into this they drop a pole with a myrtle branch fastened to its end, and bring up pitch on the myrtle, smelling like asphalt, and for the rest better than the pitch of . Then they pour it into a pit that they have dug near the pool; and when a fair amount is collected there, they fill their vessels from the pit.\nWhatever falls into the pool is carried under the ground and appears again in the sea, which is about a half a mile distant from the pool. So, then, the story that comes from the island lying off the  coast is like the truth, too.\n\n\nAnother story is told by the . There is a place in , they say, where men live beyond the Pillars of ; they come here and unload their cargo; then, having laid it in order along the beach, they go aboard their ships and light a smoking fire. The people of the country see the smoke, and, coming to the sea, they lay down gold to pay for the cargo, and withdraw from the wares.\nThen the  disembark and examine the gold; if it seems to them a fair price for their cargo, they take it and go away; but if not, they go back aboard and wait, and the people come back and add more gold until the sailors are satisfied.\nIn this transaction, it is said, neither party defrauds the other: the  do not touch the gold until it equals the value of their cargo, nor do the people touch the cargo until the sailors have taken the gold.\n\n\nThese are all the  whom we can name, and the majority of their kings cared nothing for the king of the  at the time of which I write, nor do they care for him now.\nI have this much further to say of this country: four nations and no more, as far as we know, inhabit it, two of which are aboriginal and two not; the  in the north and the  in the south of  are aboriginal; the  and  are later settlers.\n\n\nIn my opinion, there is in no part of  any great excellence for which it should be compared to  or , except in the region which is called by the same name as its river, .\nBut this region is a match for the most fertile farmland in the world, nor is it at all like to the rest of . For the soil is black and well-watered by springs, and has no fear of drought, nor is it harmed by drinking excessive showers (there is rain in this part of ). Its yield of grain is of the same measure as in the land of .\nThe land inhabited by the  is also good; it yields at the most a hundredfold; but the land of the  region yields three hundredfold.\n\n\nThe country of , which is the highest part of the  that the nomads inhabit, has the marvellous advantage of three harvest seasons. The fruits of the earth are ripe for reaping and picking on the coast first; when these have been gathered, the middle region above the coast, which they call the Hills, is ripe for gathering;\n\nand no sooner has this yield of the middle country been gathered than the highest-lying crops are mellow and ripe, so that the latest fruits of the earth are coming in when the earliest are already spent by way of food and drink. Thus the  have a harvest lasting eight months. Enough of these matters, then.\n\n\nNow when the  that  sent from  to avenge  came to , they laid siege to the city, demanding the surrender of those who were guilty of the murder of : but the , whose whole people were accessory to the deed, would not yield.\nThe  besieged  for nine months, digging underground passages leading to the walls, and making violent assaults. As for the tunnels, a blacksmith discovered them by the means of a bronze shield, and this is how he found them: carrying the shield around the inner side of the walls, he struck it against the ground of the city;\n\nall the other places which he struck returned a dull sound; but where there were tunnels, the bronze of the shield rang clear. Here the  made a counter-tunnel and killed those  who were digging underground. Thus the tunnels were discovered, and the assaults were repelled by the townsfolk.\n\n\nWhen much time had been spent and many on both sides (not less of the  than of their enemies) slain,  the general of the foot soldiers devised a plot, knowing that  could not be taken by force but might be taken by guile: he dug by night a wide trench and laid frail planks across it, which he then covered over with a layer of earth level with the ground about it.\nThen when day came, he invited the  to confer with him, and they readily consented; at last all agreed to conditions of peace. This was done thus: standing on the hidden trench, they gave and accepted a sworn assurance that their treaty would hold good while the ground where they stood was unchanged; the  promised to pay a due sum to the king, and the  to do the  no harm.\nWhen the sworn agreement was made, the townsfolk, trusting in it and opening all their gates, themselves came out of the city, and let all their enemies who so desired enter within the walls. But the  broke down the hidden bridge and ran into the city. They broke down the bridge that they had made, so that they might keep the oath which they had sworn to the : namely, that this treaty would hold good for as long as the ground remained as it was; but if they broke the bridge the treaty held good no longer.\n\n\nWhen they were delivered to her by the ,  took the most guilty of the  and set them impaled around the top of the wall; the breasts of their women she cut off and planted around the wall in like manner.\nAs for the rest of the , she told the  to take them as their booty, except those who were of the house of  and not accessory to the murder: to these she turned over the city.\n\n\nThe  thus enslaved the rest of the , and went home. When they appeared before the city of , the  let them pass through their city, so that a certain oracle might be fulfilled.\nAs the army was passing through,  the admiral of the fleet was for taking the city, but  the general of the land army would not consent, saying that he had been sent against  and no other  city; at last they passed through  and camped on the hill of ; there they regretted not having taken the city, and tried to enter it again, but the  would not let them.\nThen, although no one attacked them, panic seized the , and they fled to a place seven miles distant and camped there; and while they were there, a messenger from  came to the camp asking them to return. The  asked and received from the  provisions for their march, after which they left to go to ;\n\nbut then they fell into the hands of the , who killed the laggards and stragglers of the army for the sake of their garments and possessions; until at last they came to .\n\n\nThis  force advanced as far as  in  and no farther. As for the  whom they had taken for slaves, they carried them from  into banishment and brought them to the king, and  gave them a town of  to live in. They gave this town the name , and it remained an inhabited place in  until my own lifetime.\n\n\nBut  did not end well, either. For as soon as she had revenged herself on the  and returned to , she met an awful death. For while still alive she teemed with maggots: thus does over-brutal human revenge invite retribution from the gods. That of , daughter of , against the  was revenge of this nature and this brutality."}}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "5", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "1", "@unit":

If, however, there were no such call, they were not to attack. The  acted accordingly. When the  set up camp in front of their city, the armies then challenged each other to a threefold duel, in which man was matched against man, horse against horse, and dog against dog.\nThe  were victorious in two of the combats and raised the cry of Paean in their joy.

The , who in all else conform to the customs of other , do as I will show at the times of birth and death.\nWhen a child is born, the kinsmen sit around it and lament all the ills that it must endure from its birth onward, recounting all the sorrows of men. The dead, however, they bury with celebration and gladness, asserting that he is rid of so many ills and has achieved a state of complete blessedness.\n\n\nThose who dwell above the  have yet other practices. Each man has many wives, and at his death there is both great rivalry among his wives and eager contention on their friends' part to prove which wife was best loved by her husband. She to whom the honor is adjudged is praised by men and women alike and then slain over the tomb by her nearest of kin. After the slaying she is buried with the husband. The rest of the wives are greatly displeased by this, believing themselves to be deeply dishonored.\n\n\nAmong the rest of the , it is the custom to sell their children for export and to take no care of their maidens, allowing them to have intercourse with any man they wish. Their wives, however, they strictly guard, and buy them for a price from the parents.\nTo be tattooed is a sign of noble birth, while to bear no such marks is for the baser sort. The idler is most honored, the tiller of the soil most scorned; he is held in highest honor who lives by war and robbery.\n\n\nThese are most notable of their usages. They worship no gods but , , and . Their princes, however, unlike the rest of their countrymen, worship  above all gods and swear only by him, claiming him for their ancestor.\n\n\nThe wealthy have the following funeral practices. First they lay out the dead for three days, and after killing all kinds of victims and making lamentation, they feast. After that they do away with the body either by fire or else by burial in the earth, and when they have built a barrow, they initiate all kinds of contests, in which the greatest prizes are offered for the hardest type of single combat. Such are the  funeral rites.\n\n\nAs for the region which lies north of this country, none can tell with certainty what men dwell there, but what lies beyond the  is a desolate and infinitely large tract of land. I can learn of no men dwelling beyond the  save certain that are called  and wear Median dress.\nTheir horses are said to be covered all over with shaggy hair five fingers' breadth long, and to be small, blunt-nosed, and unable to bear men on their backs, but very swift when yoked to chariots. It is for this reason that driving chariots is the usage of the country. These men's borders, it is said, reach almost as far as the  on the .\nThey call themselves colonists from Media. How this has come about I myself cannot understand, but all is possible in the long passage of time. However that may be, we know that the  who dwell inland of  use the word sigynnae for hucksters, and the  use it for spears.\n\n\nAccording to the , all the land beyond the  is full of bees, and that by reason of these none can travel there. This, to my mind, is not a credible tale, for those creatures are ill able to bear cold. It appears to me rather that it is by reason of the cold that the northern lands are not inhabited. Such, then, are the stories about this region. Whatever the truth may be,  made its coastal area subject to the .\n\n\nAs soon as  had crossed the  and come to , he remembered the good service done him by  of  and the counsel of  the , and after sending for them to come to , he offered them a choice of whatever they wanted.\n\n, seeing that he was tyrant of , desired no further sovereignty than that, but asked for  in the  land so that he might build a city there. This, then, was ' choice, but , inasmuch as he was no tyrant but a plain citizen, asked that he might be made tyrant of .\n\n\nWhen the wishes of each had been granted, they made their way to the places of their choice, but , as it fell out, saw a sight which put it in his mind to bid  take the  and take them from their homes out of  into . There were two ,  and , who themselves desired to be rulers of their countrymen. When  had crossed into , they came to , bringing with them their sister, a tall and beautiful woman.\nThere, waiting till  should be sitting in state in the suburb of the  city, they put on their sister the best adornment they had, and sent her to draw water, bearing a vessel on her head, leading a horse by the bridle and spinning flax at the same time.\n\n took note of the woman as she passed by him, for what she did was not in the manner of the  or  or any of the peoples of . Having taken note of this, he sent some of his guards, bidding them watch what the woman would do with the horse.\nThey, accordingly, followed behind her, and she, coming to the river, watered the horse. When she had done this and had filled her vessel with water, she passed back again by the same way, bearing the water on her head, leading the horse on her arm, and plying her distaff.\n\n\nMarvelling at what he heard from his watchers and what he saw for himself,  bade the woman be brought before him. When she had been brought, her brothers, who watched all this from a place nearby, came too.  asked of what nation she was, and the young man told him that they were  and that she was their sister.\n\nBut who, he answered, are the , and where do they dwell, and with what intent have you come to ? They told him, that they had come to be his men, that the towns of  lay on the , a river not far from the , and that they were colonists from the  of .\nSo they told him all this, and the king asked them if all the women of their country were so industrious. To this too they very readily answered (for it was for this very purpose that they had come), that it was indeed so.\n\n\nThen  wrote a letter to , whom he had left as his general in , bidding him take the  from their houses, and bring them to him, men, women, and children.\n\n Immediately a horseman sped with this message to the , and upon crossing it, gave the letter to , who, after reading it, took guides from  and led his army to .\n\n\nWhen the  learned that the  were coming against them, they gathered together and marched away to the sea, thinking that the  would attempt to attack them by that way.\nSo the  were ready to withstand the onset of ' army, but the , learning that the  had gathered their forces and were guarding the coast route into their country, got guides and marched instead by the highland road. They accordingly took the  unaware and won entrance into their cities, which were left without men, and finding these empty at their attack, they easily gained them.\nThe , learning that their towns had been taken, straightway disbanded, each going his own way, and surrendered themselves to the . Thus of the  the  and  and all who lived as far as the  were taken away from their homes and led into .\n\n\nBut those near the  and the country of the  and the  and the  and the  itself were never subdued at all by . He did in fact try to take the lake-dwellers and did so in the following manner. There is set in the midst of the lake a platform made fast on tall piles, to which one bridge gives a narrow passage from the land.\nIn olden times all the people working together set the piles which support the platform there, but they later developed another method of setting them. The men bring the piles from a mountain called , and every man plants three for each of the three women that he weds.\nEach man has both a hut on the platform and a trap-door in the platform leading down into the lake. They make a cord fast to the feet of their little children out of fear that they will fall into the water.\nThey give fish as fodder to their horses and beasts of burden, and there is such an abundance of fish that a man can open his trap-door, let down an empty basket by a line into the lake, and draw it up after a short time full of fish. There are two kinds of these, some called paprakes, some tilones.\n\n\nSo those of the  who had been captured were taken into . Then , having made the  captive, sent as messengers into  the seven  who (after himself) were the most honorable in his army. These were sent to  to demand earth and water for  the king.\nNow there is a very straight way from the  to . First there is near the lake that mine from which  later drew a daily revenue of a talent of silver, and when a person has passed the mine, he need only cross the mountain called  to be in .\n\n\nThe  who had been sent as envoys came to  and demanded earth and water for  the king. He readily gave to them what they asked and invited them to be his guests, preparing a dinner of great splendor and receiving them hospitably.\nAfter dinner, the  said to  as they sat drinking together, , our host, it is our custom in  to bring in also the concubines and wedded wives to sit by the men after the giving of any great banquet. We ask you, then, (since you have received us heartily, are entertaining us nobly and are giving  our king earth and water) to follow our custom.\nTo this  replied,  We have no such custom, . Among us, men and women sit apart, but since you are our masters and are making this request, it shall be as you desire. With that,  sent for the women. Upon being called, the women entered and sat down in a row opposite the .\nThen the , seeing beautiful women before them, spoke to  and said that there was no sense in what he had done. It would be better if the women had never come at all than that they should come and not sit beside the men, but sit opposite them to torment their eyes.\n\n, now feeling compelled to do so, bade the women sit beside them. When the women had done as they were bidden, the , flushed as they were with excess of wine, at once laid hands on the women's breasts, and one or another tried to kiss them.\n\n\nThis  saw, but held his peace despite his anger because he greatly feared the . ' son , however, because of his youth and ignorance of ill deeds, could not bear it longer and said to  in great wrath, My father, do as your age demands. Leave us and take your rest; do not continue drinking. I will stay here and give our guests all that is needful.\nAt this  saw that  had some wild deed in mind and said, My son, you are angered, and if I guess your meaning correctly, you are sending me away so that you may do some violent deed. I for my part, for fear that you will bring about our undoing, entreat you not to act rashly against these men, but to bear patiently the sight of what they do.  If you want me to leave, to that I consent.\n\n\nWhen  made this request and had gone his way,  said to the , Sirs, you have full freedom to deal with these women, and may have intercourse with all or any of them.\nAs to that, you may make your own decision, but now, since the hour of your rest is drawing near and I see that you are all completely drunk, allow these women to depart and wash, if this is your desire. When they have washed, wait for them to come to you again.\nWhen he had said this and the  had given their consent, he sent the women out and away to their apartments.  then took as many beardless men as there were women, dressed them in the women's clothes, and gave them daggers. These he brought in, and said to the ,\n\nI believe, men of , that you have feasted to your hearts' content. All that we had and all besides that we could find to give you has been set before you, and now we make you a free gift of our best and most valued possession, our own mothers and sisters. Be aware that in so doing we are giving you all the honor that you deserve, and tell your king who sent you how his  viceroy of  has received you hospitably, providing food and bedfellows.\nWith that,  seated each of his  next to a , as though they were women, and when the  began to lay hands on them, they were killed by the .\n\n\nThis was the way in which they perished, they and all their retinue. Carriages too had come with them, and servants, and all the great train they had. The  made away with all that, as well as with all the envoys themselves.\nNo long time afterwards the  made a great search for these men, but  had cunning enough to put an end to it by the gift of a great sum and his own sister  to , a  and the general of those who were looking for the slain men. It was in this way, then, that the death of these  was kept silent.\n\n\nNow that these descendants of  are , as they themselves say, I myself chance to know and will prove it in the later part of my history. Furthermore, the  who manage the contest at  determined that it is so,\n\nfor when  chose to contend and entered the lists for that purpose, the  who were to run against him wanted to bar him from the race, saying that the contest should be for  and not for foreigners. , however, proving himself to be an , was judged to be a . He accordingly competed in the furlong race and tied step for first place. This, then, is approximately what happened.\n\n\n, bringing with him the , came to the , and after crossing it from there, he came to .  the  was by this time fortifying the place which he hadasked of  as his reward for guarding the bridge, a place called  by the river .  discovered what he was doing, and upon his arrival at  with the , he said to ,\n\n Sire, what is this that you have done? You have permitted a clever and cunning  to build a city in , where there are abundant forests for ship-building, much wood for oars, mines of silver, and many people both  and foreign dwelling around, who, when they have a champion to lead them, will carry out all his orders by day or by night.\nStop this man, then, from doing these things so that you will not be entangled in a war with your own subjects, but use gentle means to do so. When you have him in your grasp, see to it that he never returns to .\n\n\n easily persuaded , who believed that his vision of the future was correct. Presently the king sent a message to  which read as follows:  , these are the words of  the king: my thoughts can show me no man who is more devoted to me and my affairs. Not words but deeds have proven this to me.\nNow, therefore, let nothing prevent you from coming to me so that I may inform you of certain great purposes which I have in mind. Trusting these words, and proud, moreover, that he would be the king's counsellor,  came to .\nWhen he had come,  said to him, , I will tell you the reason why I sent for you. As soon as I returned from  and you were gone from my sight, there was nothing which I longed for so much as seeing you and speaking with you, for I knew that the most precious of all possessions is a wise and loyal friend. That you are such I can bear witness to as regards my affairs.\nNow, since you have done well in coming here, I make you this proposal. Leave  and your newly founded  city and follow me to , where you will have all that is mine, sharing my table and my counsels.\n\n\nThis, then, is what  said, and after appointing , his father's son, to be viceroy of , he rode away to , taking  with him. First, however, he made  governor of the people on the coast. ' father  had been one of the royal judges, and  had cut his throat and flayed off all his skin because he had been bribed to give an unjust judgment. Then he cut leather strips of the skin which had been torn away and with these he covered the seat upon which  had sat to give judgment.\nAfter doing this,  appointed the son of this slain and flayed  to be judge in his place, admonishing him to keep in mind the nature of the throne on which he was sitting.\n\n\nThis , then, who sat upon that seat, was now made successor to  in his governorship. He captured , ,  in the , and , and with ships he had taken from the , he took  and , both of which were still inhabited by .\n\n\nThe  fought well and defended themselves, till at last they were brought to evil plight, and the  set as governor over those that were left of them  the brother of  who had been king of .\nThis  met his end while ruling in  because he tried to enslave and subdue all the people, accusing some of shunning service against the  and others of plundering ' army on its way back from .\n\n\nAll this  achieved when he had been made governor. After only a short period of time without evils, trouble began once more to come on the , and this from  and .  surpassed all the other islands in prosperity, and at about the same time , at the height of her fortunes, was the glory of . Two generations before this, however, she had been very greatly troubled by factional strife, till the , chosen out of all the  by the  for this purpose, made peace among them,\n\n\nThe  reconciled them in the following manner. Their best men came to , and seeing the  households sadly wasted, they said that they desired to go about the country. They then made their way through all the territory of , and whenever they found any well-tilled farm in the desolation of the land, they wrote down the name of the owner of that farm.\nAfter travelling over the whole country and finding only a few such men, they assembled the people immediately upon their return to the city and appointed as rulers of the state those whose lands they had found well tilled. This they did in the belief that these men were likely to take as good care of public affairs as they had of their own, and they ordained that the rest of the  who had been at feud should obey these men.\n\n\nIt was in this way that the  made peace in , but now these cities began to bring trouble upon . Certain men of substance who had been banished by the common people, went in exile to .\nNow it chanced that the deputy ruling  was  son of , son-in-law and cousin of that  son of  whom  kept with him at .  was tyrant of  but was at  when the , who had been his guests and friends, arrived.\nWhen the  came to , they asked  if he could give them enough power to return to their own country. Believing that he would become ruler of  if they were restored to their city with his help and using as a pretext their friendship with , he made them this proposal:\n\nI myself do not have the authority to give you such power as will restore you against the will of the  who hold your city, for I know that the  have eight thousand men that bear shields, and many ships of war. Nevertheless, I will do everything I can to realize your request.\nThis is my plan.  is my friend, and he is not only ' son and brother to  the king but also governor of all the coastal peoples of . He accordingly has a great army and many ships at his disposal. This man, then, will, I think, do whatever we desire.\nHearing this, the  left the matter for  to deal with as best he could, asking him to promise gifts and the costs of the army, for which they themselves would pay since they had great hope that when they should appear off , the  would obey all their commands. The rest of the islanders, they expected, would do likewise since none of these  was as yet subject to .\n\n\n came to  and told  that  was indeed an island of no great size, but that it was otherwise a beautiful and noble island lying near . Furthermore it had a store of wealth and slaves. Therefore send an army against that country, he said,  and bring back the men who have been banished from there.\nIf you so do, I have a great sum of money at your disposal, over and above the costs of the force, for it is only fair that we, who bring you, should furnish that. Furthermore, you will win new dominions for the king,  itself and the islands which are its dependents, , , and the rest of those that are called .\nMaking these your starting point, you will easily attack , which is a great and a wealthy island, no smaller than  and very easy to take. A hundred ships suffice for the conquest of all these.\n\nThis plan which you set forth,  answered, is profitable for the king's house, and all your advice is good except as regards the number of the ships. Not one hundred but two hundred ships will be ready for you when the spring comes. The king too, however, must himself consent to this.\n\n\nWhen  heard that, he went away to  in great joy.  sent a messenger to  with the news of what  said, and when  himself too had consented to the plan, he equipped two hundred triremes and a very great company of  and their allies in addition. For their general he appointed , a  of the  family, cousin to himself and to . This was he whose daughter (if indeed the tale is true)  the , son of , at a later day betrothed to himself, since it was his wish to possess the sovereignty of . After appointing  general,  sent his army away to .\n\n\nThen , bringing  from , the  army, and the , pretended to be sailing to the , but when he came to , he put in with his ships at  so that he might cross with a north wind to .\nSince it was not fated that the  were to be destroyed by this force, the following things took place. As  was making his rounds among the ships' watches, it chanced that there was no watch on the ship of . , very angry at this, ordered his guards to find the captain of this ship, whose name was , and thrust him partly through an oar-hole of the ship and bound him there so that his head was outside the ship and his body inside.\nWhen  had been bound, someone brought word to , that his  friend was bound and being disgracefully treated by .  then went and pleaded with the  for , but since he obtained nothing that he requested, he went and released the man himself. When  learned this, he took it very badly and was angry at .\n\n, however, said, But you, what have you to do with these matters? Did not  send you to obey me and to sail wherever I bid you? Why are you so meddlesome? This response on the part of  enraged , who, went night fell, sent men in a boat to  to tell the  of the trouble in store for them.\n\n\nNow the  had no suspicion at all that it was they who were to be attacked by that force. However, when they learned the truth, they immediately brought inside their walls all that was in their fields, stored both meat and drink in case of a siege, and strengthened their walls.\n\n The , then, made all preparations to face the onset of war. When their enemies had brought their ships over from  to , it was a fortified city that they attacked, and for four months they besieged it.\nWhen the  had exhausted all the money with which they had come, and  himself had spent much beside, they built a stronghold for the banished , and went off to the mainland in poor spirits since still more money was needed for the siege.\n\n\n had no way of fulfilling his promise to , and he was hard-pressed by demands for the costs of the force. Furthermore he feared what might come of the failure of the army and ' displeasure against him. It was likely, he thought, that his lordship of  would be taken away from him.\nWith all these fears in his mind, he began to plan revolt, for it chanced that at that very time there came from  ' messenger, the man with the marked head, signifying that  should revolt from the king.\nSince  desired to give word to  that he should revolt and had no other safe way of doing so because the roads were guarded, he shaved and branded the head of his most trustworthy slave. He waited till the hair had grown again, and as soon as it was grown, he sent the man to  with no other message except that when he came to  he must bid  shave his hair and examine his head. The writing branded on it signified revolt, as I have already said.\nThis  did because he greatly disliked his detention at  and fully expected to be sent away to the coast in the case that there should be a revolt. If, however,  remained at peace, he calculated that he would never return there.\n\n\nWith this intent, then,  sent his messenger, and it chanced that all these things came upon  at one and the same time. He accordingly took counsel with the members of his faction, stating his own opinion as well as the message which had come to him from .\nAll the rest spoke their minds to the same effect, favoring revolt, with the exception of  the historian who, listing all the nations subject to  and all his power, advised them that they should not make war on the king of . When, however, he failed to persuade them, he counselled them that their next best plan was to make themselves masters of the sea.\nThis, he said, could only be accomplished in one way (, he knew, was a city of no great wealth), namely if they took away from the temple at  the treasure which  the  had dedicated there. With this at their disposal, he fully expected them to gain the mastery of the sea. They would then have the use of that treasure and their enemies would not be able to plunder it.\nThe treasure was very great, as I have shown in the beginning of my account. This plan was not approved, and they resolved that they would revolt. One out of their number was to sail to , to the army which had left  and was there, and attempt to seize the generals who were aboard the ships.\n\n\n, who had been sent for this very purpose, craftily seized  of  son of ;  of  son of ;  son of , to whom  gave ;  of , son of ; and many others besides. Then  revolted openly, devising all he could to harm .\nFirst he made pretence of giving up his tyranny and gave  equality of government so that the  might readily join in his revolt. Then he proceeded to do the same things in the rest of . Some of the tyrants he banished, and as for those tyrants whom he had taken out of the ships that sailed with him against , he handed them each over to their respective cities, which he wished to please.\n\n\n, when the  received him, was taken out and stoned, but the , as well as most of the others, let their own man go.\nIn this way, then, an end was made of tyrants in the cities. After doing away with the tyrants,  of  ordered all the peoples to set up governors in each city. Then he went on an embassy in a trireme to , for it was necessary for him to find some strong ally.\n\n\nAt ,  the son of , who had been king, was now no longer alive but was dead, and  son of  held the royal power. This he had won not by manly merit but by right of birth.  had as his wife his own sister's daughter, and although he was content with her, no children were born to him.\nSince this was the case, the  called him to them and said, Even if you have no interest in caring for yourself, we cannot allow the house of  to perish. Therefore send away the wife that you have, seeing that she bears you no children, and wed another. If you do this, you will please the . , however, said in response that he would do neither of these things and that they were not giving him good advice in bidding him to get rid of his present wife, who was blameless, and to marry another.\n\n\nThen the  and Elders took counsel, and placed this proposal before : Since, as we see, you cling to the wife that you have, carry out our command, and do not hold out against it, bearing in mind that the  will certainly find some other way of dealing with you.\nAs for the wife that you have, we do not ask that you send her away. Keep providing her with all that you give her now and marry another woman in addition who can give you children. So they spoke, and  consented. Presently he had two wives and kept two households, a thing which is not at all customary at .\n\n\nAfter no long time the second wife gave birth to . She, then, gave the  an heir to the royal power, and as luck would have it, the first wife, who had been barren before, conceived at that very time.\nWhen the friends of the new wife learned that the other woman was pregnant, they began to make trouble for her. They said that she was making an empty boast, so that she might substitute a child. The  were angry, and when her time drew near, they sat around to watch her in childbirth because of their skepticism.\nShe gave birth first to , then straightway to , and right after him to . Some, however, say that  and  were twins. As for the later wife, the mother of  and the daughter of  son of , she bore no more children.\n\n\nNow , as the story goes, was not in his right mind and really quite mad, while  was first among all of his peers and fully believed that he would be made king for his manly worth.\nSince he was of this opinion,  was very angry when at ' death the  followed their custom and made  king by right of age. Since he would not tolerate being made subject to , he asked the  for a group of people whom he took away as colonists. He neither inquired of the oracle at  in what land he should establish his settlement, nor did anything else that was customary but set sail in great anger for , with men of  to guide him.\nWhen he arrived there, he settled by the  in the fairest part of , but in the third year he was driven out by the , the  and the  and returned to the .\n\n\nThere , a man of , advised him, on the basis of the oracles of , to plant a colony at  in , for  himself, said , had won all the region of , which accordingly belonged to his descendants. When  heard that, he went away to  to enquire of the oracle if he should seize the place to which he was preparing to go. The priestess responded that it should be so, and he took with him the company that he had led to  and went to .\n\n\nNow at this time, as the  say, they and their king  were making ready to march against , and the men of , who were very much afraid, entreated  to come to their aid. Their request was granted, and  marched with them to  helping them to take it.\nThis is the story which the  tell of  and his companions, but the  say that they were aided by no stranger in their war with  with the exception of , an  diviner of the  clan. About him there was a story that he had fled to  from , the tyrant of , because as he was sacrificing for victory over , he could obtain no favorable omens.\n\n\nThis is their tale, and both cities have proof of the truth of what they say. The  point to a precinct and a temple beside the dry bed of the , which, they say,  founded in honor of  of  after he had helped to take their city. and find their strongest proof in his death. He perished through doing more than the oracle bade him, for if he had accomplished no more than that which he set out to do, he would have taken and held the  region without bringing about the death of himself and his army.\nThe , on the other hand, show many plots of land which had been set apart for and given to  of  and on which ' posterity dwelt even to my time but show no gift to  and his descendants. They claim, however,that if  had aided them in their war with , he would have received a reward many times greater than what was given to . This, then is the evidence brought forward by each party, and each may side with that which seems to him to deserve more credence.\n\n\nOther  too sailed with  to found his colony, namely, , , , and . When these men had come to  with all their company, they were all overcome and slain in battle by the  and , all, that is, except , who was the only settler that survived this disaster.\n\n He mustered the remnant of his army and took , the colony from , and aided in freeing the people of  from their monarch . After deposing this man, he himself attempted to become tyrant of  but was monarch there for only a little while since the people of the place rose against him and slew him at the altar of  of the marketplace, to which he had fled for refuge.\n\n\n of , son of , was among those who followed  and were slain with him. He had been betrothed to the daughter of  of  but was banished from . Cheated out of his marriage, he sailed away to , from where he set forth and followed , bringing his own trireme and covering all expenses for his men. This  was a victor at  and the fairest  of his day.\n\n For his physical beauty he received from the  honors accorded to no one else. They built a hero's shrine by his grave and offer him sacrifices of propitiation.\n\n\nSuch, then, was the manner of ' death. Had he endured ' rule and stayed at  he would have been king of , for  reigned no long time, and died leaving no son but one only daughter, whose name was .\n\n\nIt was in the reign of  that  the tyrant of  came to . When he had an audience with the king, as the  report, he brought with him a bronze tablet on which the map of all the earth was engraved, and all the sea and all the rivers.\nHaving been admitted to converse with ,  spoke thus to him: Do not wonder, , that I have been so eager to come here, for our present situation is such that the sons of the  are slaves and not free men, which is shameful and grievous particularly to ourselves but also, of all others, to you, inasmuch as you are the leaders of .\nNow, therefore, we entreat you by the gods of  to save your  kinsmen from slavery. This is a thing which you can easily achieve, for the strangers are not valiant men while your valor in war is preeminent. As for their manner of fighting, they carry bows and short spears, and they go to battle with trousers on their legs and turbans on their heads.\nAccordingly, they are easy to overcome. Furthermore, the inhabitants of that continent have more good things than all other men together, gold first but also silver, bronze, colored cloth, beasts of burden, and slaves. All this you can have to your heart's desire.\nThe lands in which they dwell lie next to each other, as I shall show: next to the  are the , who inhabit a good land and have great store of silver. (This he said pointing to the map of the earth which he had brought engraved on the tablet.) Next to the , said , you see the  to the east, men that of all known to me are the richest in flocks and in the fruits of the earth.\nClose by them are the , whom we call , and their neighbors are the , whose land reaches to the sea over there, in which you see the island of  lying. The yearly tribute which they pay to the king is five hundred talents. Next to the , are the , another people rich in flocks, and after the , the , whose country I show you.\nAdjoining these you see the  land, in which, on the , lies that  where the great king lives and where the storehouses of his wealth are located. Take that city, and you need not fear to challenge  for riches.\nYou should suspend your war, then, for strips of land of no great worthfor that fight with with , who are matched in strength with you, and  and , men who have nothing in the way of gold or silver (for which things many are spurred by zeal to fight and die). Yet when you can readily be masters of all , will you refuse to attempt it?\nThus spoke , and  replied: , my guest, wait till the third day for my answer.\n\n\nAt that time, then, they got so far. When, on the day appointed for the answer, they came to the place upon which they had agreed,  asked  how many days' journey it was from the  to the king.\nTill now,  had been cunning and fooled the  well, but here he made a false step. If he desired to take the  away into  he should never have told the truth, but he did tell it, and said that it was a three months' journey inland.\nAt that,  cut short ' account of the prospective journey. He then bade his  guest depart from  before sunset, for never, he said, would the  listen to the plan, if  desired to lead them a three months' journey from the sea.\n\n\n went to his house after this exchange, but  took a suppliant's garb and followed him there. Upon entering, he used a suppliant's right to beg  to listen to him. He first asked  to send away the child, his daughter , who was standing by him. She was his only child, and was about eight or nine years of age.  bade him say whatever he wanted and not let the child's presence hinder him.\nThen  began to promise  from ten talents upwards, if he would grant his request. When  refused,  offered him ever more and more. When he finally promised fifty talents the child cried out, Father, the stranger will corrupt you, unless you leave him and go away.\n\n was pleased with the child's counsel and went into another room while  departed from , finding no further occasion for telling of the journey inland to the king's palace.\n\n\nNow the nature of this road is as I will show. All along it are the king's road stations and very good resting places, and the whole of it passes through country that is inhabited and safe. Its course through  and  is of the length of twenty stages, and ninety-four and a half parasangs.\nNext after  it comes to the river , where there is both a defile which must be passed before the river can be crossed and a great fortress to guard it. After the passage into , the road in that land as far as the borders of  is of twenty-eight stages and one hundred and four parasangs. On this frontier you must ride through two defiles and pass two fortresses.\nRide past these, and you will have a journey through  of three stages and fifteen and a half parasangs. The boundary of  and  is a navigable river, the name of which is the . In  there are fifteen resting-stages and fifty-six and a half parasangs. Here too there is a fortress. From  the road enters the  land, in which there are thirty-four stages and one hundred and thirty-seven parasangs.\nThrough this land flow four navigable rivers which must be passed by ferries, first the , then a second and a third of the same name, yet not the same stream nor flowing from the same source. The first-mentioned of them flows from the  and the second from the .\nThe fourth river is called , that  which  parted once into three hundred and sixty channels.\nWhen this country is passed, the road is in the  land, where there are eleven stages and forty-two and a half parasangs, as far as yet another navigable river, the , on the banks of which stands the city of .\n\n\nThus the sum total of stages is one hundred and eleven. So many resting-stages, then, are there in the journey up from  to . If I have accurately counted the parasangs of the royal road, and the parasang is of thirty furlongs' length, which assuredly it is, then between  and the king's abode called  there are thirteen thousand and five hundred furlongs, the number of parasangs being four hundred and fifty. If each day's journey is one hundred and fifty furlongs, then the sum of days spent is ninety, neither more nor less.\n\n\n of  accordingly spoke the truth to  the  when he said that the journey inland was three months long. If anyone should desire a more exact measurement, I will give him that too, for the journey from  to  must be added to the rest.\n\n So, then, from the  to , which is the city called , it is a journey of fourteen thousand and forty stages, for there are five hundred and forty furlongs from  to . The three months' journey is accordingly made longer by three days.\n\n\nWhen he was forced to leave ,  went to , which had been freed from its ruling tyrants in the manner that I will show. First , son of  and brother of the tyrant , had been slain by  and , men of  descent. This was in fact an evil of which he had received a premonition in a dream. After this the  were subject for four years to a tyranny not less but even more absolute than before.\n\n\nNow this was the vision which  saw in a dream: in the night before the  he thought that a tall and handsome man stood over him uttering these riddling verses:\n\n\n\nAs soon as it was day, he imparted this to the interpreters of dreams, and presently putting the vision from his mind, he led the procession in which he met his death.\n\n\nNow the  clan, of which the slayers of  were members, claim to have come at first from , but my own enquiry shows that they were among the  who came with  to the country now called . In that country the lands of  were allotted to them, and this is where they settled.\nThe  had first been expelled from there by the , and these  were forced to go to  after being expelled in turn by the . The  received them as citizens of their own on set terms, debarring them from many practices not deserving of mention here.\n\n\nThese  who came with  and of whom the  were a part brought with them to , among many other kinds of learning, the alphabet, which had been unknown before this, I think, to the . As time went on the sound and the form of the letters were changed.\nAt this time the  who were settled around them were for the most part , and after being taught the letters by the , they used them with a few changes of form. In so doing, they gave to these characters the name of , as was quite fair seeing that the  had brought them into .\nThe  have also from ancient times called sheets of papyrus skins, since they formerly used the skins of sheep and goats due to the lack of papyrus. Even to this day there are many foreigners who write on such skins.\n\n\nI have myself seen  writing in the temple of  at  of  engraved on certain tripods and for the most part looking like  letters. On one of the tripods there is this inscription: \n\nThis would date from about the time of  the son of , grandson of  and great-grandson of .\n\n\nA second tripod says, in hexameter verse: \n\n the son of , if he is indeed the dedicator and not another of the same name, would have lived at the time of  son of .\n\n\nThe third tripod says, in hexameter verse again: \n\n\n\nDuring the rule of this  son of , the  were expelled by the  and went away to the . The  were left behind but were later compelled by the  to withdraw to . They have certain set forms of worship at  in which the rest of the  take no part, particularly the rites and mysteries of .\n\n\nI have told both of the vision of ' dream and of the first origin of the , to whom the slayers of  belonged. Now I must go further and return to the story which I began to tell, namely how the  were freed from their tyrants.\n\n, their tyrant, was growing ever more bitter in enmity against the  because of ' death, and the , a family of  stock banished by the sons of , attempted with the rest of the exiled  to make their way back by force and free . They were not successful in their return and suffered instead a great reverse. After fortifying  north of , they, in their desire to use all devices against the sons of , hired themselves to the  for the building of the temple at  which exists now but was not there yet then.\nSince they were wealthy and like their fathers men of reputation, they made the temple more beautiful than the model showed. In particular, whereas they had agreed to build the temple of tufa, they made its front of  marble.\n\n\nThese men, as the  say, established themselves at  and bribed the  priestess to bid any  who should come to inquire of her on a private or a public account to set  free.\nThen the , when the same command was ever revealed to them, sent  the son of , a citizen of repute, to drive out the sons of  with an army despite the fact that the  were their close friends, for the god's will weighed with them more than the will of man.\nThey sent these men by sea on shipboard.  put in at  and disembarked his army there. The sons of , however, had received word of the plan already, and sent to ask help from the  with whom they had an alliance. The , at their entreaty, joined together and sent their own king,  of , with a thousand horsemen. When the  got these allies, they devised the following plan.\nFirst they laid waste the plain of  so that all that land could be ridden over and then launched their cavalry against the enemy's army. Then the horsemen charged and slew  and many more of the , and drove those that survived to their ships. Accordingly, the first  army drew off, and ' tomb is at  in , near to the  in .\n\n\nAfter this the  sent out a greater army to attack , appointing as its general their king  son of . This army they sent not by sea but by land.\nWhen they broke into , the  horsemen were the first to meet them. They were routed after only a short time, and more than forty men were slain. Those who were left alive made off for  by the nearest way they could. Then , when he and the  who desired freedom came into the city, drove the tyrants' family within the  wall and besieged them there.\n\n\nThe  would never have taken the  stronghold. First of all they had no intention to blockade it, and secondly the  were well furnished with food and drink. The  would only have besieged the place for a few days and then returned to . As it was, however, there was a turn of fortune which harmed the one party and helped the other, for the sons of the  family were taken as they were being secretly carried out of the country.\nWhen this happened, all their plans were confounded, and they agreed to depart from  within five days on the terms prescribed to them by the  in return for the recovery of their children.\nAfterwards they departed to  on the . They had ruled the  for thirty-six years and were in lineage of the house of  and , born of the same ancestors as the families of  and , who had formerly come from foreign parts to be kings of .\n\n It was for this reason that  gave his son the name  as a remembrance, calling him after  the son of .\nThis is the way, then, that the  got rid of their tyrants. As regards all the noteworthy things which they did or endured after they were freed and before  revolted from  and  of  came to  to ask help of its people, of these I will first give an account.\n\n\n, which had been great before, now grew even greater when her tyrants had been removed. The two principal holders of power were  an , who was reputed to have bribed the  priestess, and  son of , a man of a notable house but his lineage I cannot say. His kinsfolk, at any rate, sacrifice to  of .\nThese men with their factions fell to contending for power,  was getting the worst of it in this dispute and took the commons into his party. Presently he divided the  into ten tribes instead of four as formerly. He called none after the names of the sons of , , , and but invented for them names taken from other heroes, all native to the country except . Him he added despite the fact that he was a stranger because he was a neighbor and an ally.\n\n\nIn doing this, to my thinking, this  was imitating his own mother's father,  the tyrant of , for , after going to war with the , made an end of minstrels' contests at  by reason of the Homeric poems, in which it is the  and  which are primarily the theme of the songs. Furthermore, he conceived the desire to cast out from the land  son of , the hero whose shrine stood then as now in the very marketplace of  because he was an .\nHe went then to , and asked the oracle if he should cast  out, but the priestess said in response:  is king of , and you but a stone thrower. When the god would not permit him to do as he wished in this matter, he returned home and attempted to devise some plan which might rid him of . When he thought he had found one, he sent to  saying that he would gladly bring  son of  into his country, and the  handed him over.\nWhen  had brought him in, he consecrated a sanctuary for him in the government house itself, where he was established in the greatest possible security. Now the reason why  brought in , a thing which I must relate, was that  was ' deadliest enemy, for  had slain his brother  and his son-in-law .\nHaving then designated the precinct for him,  took away all ' sacrifices and festivals and gave them to . The  had been accustomed to pay very great honor to  because the country had once belonged to , his maternal grandfather, who died without an heir and bequeathed the kingship to him.\nBesides other honors paid to  by the , they celebrated his lamentable fate with tragic choruses in honor not of  but of . , however, gave the choruses back to  and the rest of the worship to .\n\n\nThis, then, is what he did regarding , but as for the tribes of the , he changed their names so that these tribes should not be shared by  and . In this especially he made a laughing-stock of the , for he gave the tribes names derived from the words donkey and pig changing only the endings. The name of his own tribe, however, he did not change in this way, but rather gave it a name indicating his own rule, calling it , rulers of the people. The rest were ,  and .\nThese were the names of the tribes which the  used under ' rule and for sixty years more after his death. Afterwards, however, they took counsel together and both changed the names of three to , , and , and added a fourth which they called  after  son of .\n\n\nThis is what the   had done, and the  , following the lead of his grandfather and namesake, decided out of contempt, I imagine, for the , that his tribes should not be the same as theirs.\nWhen he had drawn into his own party the  people, which was then debarred from all rights, he gave the tribes new names and increased their number, making ten tribe-wardens in place of four, and assigning ten districts to each tribe. When he had won over the people, he was stronger by far than the rival faction.\n\n\n, who was on the losing side, devised a counter-plot, and invited the aid of , who had been his friend since the besieging of the . It was even said of  that he regularly went to see ' wife.\nThen  first sent a herald to  demanding the banishment of  and many other  with him, the Accursed, as he called them. This he said in his message by ' instruction, for the  and their faction were held to be guilty of that bloody deed while  and his friends had no part in it.\n\n\nHow the Accursed at  had received their name, I will now relate. There was an  named , who had been a winner at . This man put on the air of one who aimed at tyranny, and gathering a company of men of like age, he attempted to seize the citadel. When he could not win it, he took sanctuary by the goddess' statue.\nHe and his men were then removed from their position by the presidents of the naval boards, the rulers of  at that time. Although they were subject to any penalty save death, they were slain, and their death was attributed to the . All this took place before the time of .\n\n\nWhen  had sent for and demanded the banishment of  and the Accursed,  himself secretly departed. Afterwards, however,  appeared in  with no great force. Upon his arrival, he, in order to take away the curse, banished seven hundred  families named for him by . Having so done he next attempted to dissolve the Council, entrusting the offices of government to ' faction.\nThe Council, however, resisted him, whereupon  and  and his partisans seized the acropolis. The rest of the  united and besieged them for two days. On the third day as many of them as were  left the country under truce.\nThe prophetic voice that  heard accordingly had its fulfillment, for when he went up to the acropolis with the intention of taking possession of it, he approached the shrine of the goddess to address himself to her. The priestess rose up from her seat, and before he had passed through the door-way, she said, Go back,  stranger, and do not enter the holy place since it is not lawful that  should pass in here. My lady, he answered, I am not a , but an .\nSo without taking heed of the omen, he tried to do as he pleased and was, as I have said, then again cast out together with his . As for the rest, the  imprisoned them under sentence of death. Among the prisoners was  the , whose achievements of strength and courage were quite formidable.\n\n\nThese men, then, were bound and put to death. After that, the  sent to bring back  and the seven hundred households banished by . Then, desiring to make an alliance with the , they despatched envoys to , for they knew that they had provoked the  and  to war.\nWhen the envoys came to  and spoke as they had been bidden,  son of , viceroy of , asked them, What men are you and where do you live, who desire alliance with the ? When he had received the information he wanted from the envoys, he gave them an answer the substance of which was that if the  gave king  earth and water, then he would make an alliance with them, but if not, his command was that they should depart.\nThe envoys consulted together, and in their desire to make the alliance, they consented to give what was asked. They then returned to their own country and were there greatly blamed for what they had done.\n\n\n, however, fully aware that the  had done him wrong in word and deed, mustered an army from the whole of the . He did not declare the purpose for which he mustered it, namely to avenge himself on the  people and set up , who had come with him out of the acropolis, as tyrant.\n\n broke in as far as  with a great host, and the , by a concerted plan, took  and , districts on the borders of , while the  attacked on another side and raided lands in . The , who were now caught in a ring of foes, decided to oppose the  at  and to deal with the  and  later.\n\n\nWhen the armies were about to join battle, the , coming to the conclusion that they were acting wrongly, changed their minds and departed. Later  son of , the other king of , did likewise, despite the fact that he had come with  from  in joint command of the army and had not till now been at variance with him.\nAs a result of this dissension, a law was made at  that when an army was despatched, both kings would not be permitted to go with it. Until that time they had both gone together, but now one of the kings was released from service and one of the sons of  too could be left at home. Before that time, both of these also were asked to give aid and went with the army.\nSo now at , when the rest of the allies saw that the  kings were not of one mind and that the  had left their host, they too went off.\n\n\nThis was the fourth time that  had come into . They had come twice as invaders in war and twice as helpers of the  people. The first time was when they planted a settlement at (this expedition may rightly be said to have been in the reign of ), the second and third when they set out from  to drive out the sons of , and the fourth was now, when  broke in as far as  with his following of . This was accordingly the fourth  invasion of .\n\n\nWhen this force then had been ingloriously scattered, the  first marched against the  to punish them. The  came to the  to help the  and as soon as the  saw these allies, they resolved to attack the  before the .\nWhen they met the  in battle, they won a great victory, slaying very many and taking seven hundred of them prisoner. On that same day the  crossed to  where they met the  too in battle, and after overcoming them as well, they left four thousand tenant farmers on the lands of the horse-breeders.\nHorse-breeders was the name given to the men of substance among the . They fettered as many of these as they took alive and kept them imprisoned with the captive . In time, however, they set them free, each for an assessed ransom of two minae. The fetters in which the prisoners had been bound they hung up in the acropolis, where they could still be seen in my time hanging from walls which the ' fire had charred, opposite the temple which faces west.\n\n Moreover, they made a dedication of a tenth part of the ransom, and this money was used for the making of a four-horse chariot which stands on the left hand of the entrance into the outer porch of the acropolis and bears this inscription:\n\n\n\n\nSo the  grew in power and proved, not in one respect only but in all, that equality is a good thing. Evidence for this is the fact that while they were under tyrannical rulers, the  were no better in war than any of their neighbors, yet once they got rid of their tyrants, they were by far the best of all. This, then, shows that while they were oppressed, they were, as men working for a master, cowardly, but when they were freed, each one was eager to achieve for himself.\n\n\nThis, then, is the course of action which the  took, and the , desiring vengeance on , afterwards appealed to  for advice. The  priestess said that the  themselves would not be able to obtain the vengeance they wanted and that they should lay the matter before the many-voiced and entreat their nearest.\nUpon the return of the envoys, an assembly was called and the oracle put before it. When the  heard that they must entreat their nearest, they said, If this is so, our nearest neighbors are the men of  and  and . These are always our comrades in battle and zealously wage our wars. What need, then, is there to entreat them? Perhaps this is the meaning of the oracle.\n\n\nThey reasoned in this way, till at last one understood, and said: I think that I perceive what the oracle is trying to tell us.  and , it is said, were daughters of  and sisters. The god's answer is, I think, that we should ask the  to be our avengers.\n\n Seeing that there seemed to be no better opinion before them than this, they sent straightaway to entreat the  and invite their aid, since this was the oracle's bidding, and the  were their nearest. These replied to their demand that they were sending the Sons of  in aid.\n\n\nThe  took the field on the strength of their alliance with that family but were soundly beaten by the . Thereupon they sent a second message to , giving back the sons of  and asking for some men instead.\nThe , who were enjoying great prosperity and remembered their old feud with , accordingly made war on the  at the entreaty of the  without sending a herald.\nWhile the  were busy with the , they descended on  in ships of war, and ravaged  and many other seaboard townships. By so doing they dealt the  a very shrewd blow.\n\n\nThis was the beginning of the ' long-standing debt of enmity against the . The ' land bore no produce. For this reason they inquired at  concerning this calamity, and the priestess bade them set up images of  and , saying that if they so did their luck would be better. The  then asked in addition whether they should make the images of bronze or of stone, and the priestess bade them do neither, but make them of the wood of the cultivated olive.\nSo the men of  asked the  to permit them to cut down some olive trees, supposing the olives there to be the holiest. Indeed it is said that at that time there were no olives anywhere save at .\nThe  consented to give the trees, if the  would pay yearly sacred dues to , the city's goddess, and to . The  agreed to this condition, and their request was granted. When they set up images made of these olive trees, their land brought forth fruit, and they fulfilled their agreement with the .\n\n\nNow at this time, as before it, the  were in all matters still subject to the  and even crossed to  for the hearing of their own private lawsuits. From this time, however, they began to build ships, and stubbornly revolted from the .\nIn the course of this struggle, they did the  much damage and stole their images of  and . These they took away and set them up in the middle of their own country at a place called , about twenty furlongs distant from their city.\nHaving set them up in this place they sought their favor with sacrifices and female choruses in the satirical and abusive mode. Ten men were appointed providers of a chorus for each of the deities, and the choruses aimed their raillery not at any men but at the women of the country. The  too had the same rites, and they have certain secret rites as well.\n\n\nWhen these images were stolen, the  ceased from fulfilling their agreement with the . Then the  sent an angry message to the  who pleaded in turn that they were doing no wrong. For as long, they said, as we had the images in our country, we fulfilled our agreement. Now that we are deprived of them, it is not just that we should still be paying. Ask your dues of the men of , who have the images.\n\n The  therefore sent to  and demanded that the images be restored, but the  answered that they had nothing to do with the .\n\n\nThe  report that after making this demand, they despatched one trireme with certain of their citizens who, coming in the name of the whole people to , attempted to tear the images, as being made of Attic wood, from their bases so that they might carry them away.\nWhen they could not obtain possession of them in this manner, they tied cords around the images with which they could be dragged. While they were attempting to drag them off, they were overtaken both by a thunderstorm and an earthquake. This drove the trireme's crew to such utter madness that they began to slay each other as if they were enemies. At last only one of all was left, who returned by himself to .\n\n\nThis is the  version of the matter, but the  say that the  came not in one ship only, for they could easily have kept off a single ship, or several, for that matter, even if they had no navy themselves. The truth was, they said, that the  descended upon their coasts with many ships and that they yielded to them without making a fight of it at sea.\nThey are not able to determine clearly whether it was because they admitted to being weaker at sea-fighting that they yielded, or because they were planning what they then actually did.\nWhen, as the  say, no man came out to fight with them, the  disembarked from their ships and turned their attention to the images. Unable to drag them from the bases, they fastened cords on them and dragged them until they boththis I cannot believe, but another mightfell on their knees. Both have remained in this position ever since.\nThis is what the  did, but the  say that they discovered that the  were about to make war upon them and therefore assured themselves of help from the . So when the  disembarked on the land of , the  came to aid the , crossing over from  to the island secretly. They then fell upon the  unaware and cut them off from their ships. It was at this moment that the thunderstorm and earthquake came upon them\n\n\nThis, then, is the story told by the  and , and the  too acknowledge that only one man of their number returned safely to .\nThe , however, say that he escaped after they had destroyed the rest of the  force, while the  claim that the whole thing was to be attributed to divine power. This one man did not survive but perished in the following manner. It would seem that he made his way to  and told of the mishap. When the wives of the men who had gone to attack  heard this, they were very angry that he alone should be safe. They gathered round him and stabbed him with the brooch-pins of their garments, each asking him where her husband was.\nThis is how this man met his end, and the  found the action of their women to be more dreadful than their own misfortune. They could find, it is said, no other way to punish the women than changing their dress to the  fashion. Until then the  women had worn  dress, which is very like the . It was changed, therefore, to the linen tunic, so that they might have no brooch-pins to use.\n\n\nThe truth of the matter, however, is that this form of dress is not in its origin , but , for in ancient times all women in  wore the costume now known as .\nAs for the  and , this was the reason of their passing a law in both their countries that brooch-pins should be made half as long as they used to be and that brooches should be the principal things offered by women in the shrines of these two goddesses. Furthermore, nothing else Attic should be brought to the temple, not even pottery, and from that time on only drinking vessels made in the country should be used.\n\n\nEver since that day even to my time the women of  and  wore brooch-pins longer than before, by reason of the feud with the . The enmity of the  against the  began as I have told, and now at the ' call the  came readily to the aid of the , remembering the matter of the images.\nWhile the  were laying waste to the seaboard of , the  were setting out to march against them, but an oracle from  came to them bidding them to restrain themselves for thirty years after the wrongdoing of the , and in the thirty-first to mark out a precinct for  and begin the war with . In this way their purpose would prosper. If, however, they sent an army against their enemies straightaway, they would indeed subdue them in the end but would in the meantime both suffer and do many things.\nWhen the  heard this reported to them, they marked out for  that precinct which is now set in their marketplace, but they could not stomach the order that they must hold their hand for thirty years, seeing that the  had dealt them a foul blow.\n\n\nAs they were making ready for vengeance, a matter which took its rise in  hindered them, for when the  learned of the plot of the  with the  priestess and of her plot against themselves and the , they were very angry for two reasons, namely that they had driven their own guests and friends from the country they dwelt in, and that the  showed them no gratitude for their doing so.\nFurthermore, they were spurred on by the oracles which foretold that many deeds of enmity would be perpetrated against them by the . Previously they had had no knowledge of these oracles but now  brought them to , and the  learned their contents. It was from the  acropolis that  took the oracles, which had been in the possession of the  earlier. When they were exiled, they left them in the temple from where they were retrieved by .\n\n\nNow the , when they regained the oracles and saw the  increasing in power and in no way inclined to obey them, realized that if the  remained free, they would be equal in power with themselves, but that if they were held down under tyranny, they would be weak and ready to serve a master. Perceiving all this, they sent to bring ' son  from  on the , the 's place of refuge.\nWhen  arrived, the  sent for envoys from the rest of their allies and spoke to them as follows: Sirs, our allies, we do acknowledge that we have acted wrongly, for, led astray by lying divinations, we drove from their native land men who were our close friends and promised to make  subject to us. Then we handed that city over to a thankless people which had no sooner lifted up its head in the freedom which we gave it, than it insolently cast out us and our king. Now it has bred such a spirit of pride and is growing so much in power, that its neighbors in  and  have really noticed it, and others too will soon recognize their error.\nSince we erred in doing what we did, we will now attempt with your aid to avenge ourselves on them. It is on this account and no other that we have sent for , whom you see, and have brought you from your cities, namely that uniting our counsels and our power, we may bring him to  and restore that which we took away.\n\n\nThese were the words of the , but their words were ill-received by the greater part of their allies. The rest then keeping silence, , a , said,\n\n\nIn truth heaven will be beneath the earth and the earth aloft above the heaven, and men will dwell in the sea and fishes where men dwelt before, now that you, , are destroying the rule of equals and making ready to bring back tyranny into the cities, tyranny, a thing more unrighteous and bloodthirsty than anything else on this earth.\nIf indeed it seems to you to be a good thing that the cities be ruled by tyrants, set up a tyrant among yourselves first and then seek to set up such for the rest. As it is, however, you, who have never made trial of tyrants and take the greatest precautions that none will arise at , deal wrongfully with your allies. If you had such experience of that thing as we have, you would be more prudent advisers concerning it than you are now.\n\nThe  state was ordered in such manner as I will show.There was an oligarchy, and this group of men, called the , held sway in the city, marrying and giving in marriage among themselves. Now , one of these men, had a crippled daughter, whose name was . Since none of the  would marry her, she was wedded to  son of , of the township of , a  by lineage and of the posterity of .\nWhen no sons were born to him by this wife or any other, he set out to  to enquire concerning the matter of acquiring offspring. As soon as he entered, the  priestess spoke these verses to him: \n\n\nThis oracle which was given to  was in some way made known to the . The earlier oracle sent to  had not been understood by them, despite the fact that its meaning was the same as the meaning of the oracle of , and it read as follows: \n\n\n\n\nThis earlier prophecy had been unintelligible to the , but as soon as they heard the one which was given to , they understood it at once, recognizing its similarity with the oracle of . Now understanding both oracles, they kept quiet but resolved to do away with the offspring of . Then, as soon as his wife had given birth, they sent ten men of their clan to the township where  dwelt to kill the child.\nThese men came to  and passing into 's courtyard, asked for the child. , knowing nothing of the purpose of their coming and thinking that they wished to see the baby out of affection for its father, brought it and placed it into the hands of one of them. Now they had planned on their way that the first of them who received the child should dash it to the ground.\nWhen, however,  brought and handed over the child, by divine chance it smiled at the man who took it. This he saw, and compassion prevented him from killing it. Filled with pity, he handed it to a second, and this man again to a third.In fact it passed from hand to hand to each of the ten, for none would make an end of it.\nThey then gave the child back to its mother, and after going out, they stood before the door reproaching and upbraiding one another, but chiefly him who had first received it since he had not acted in accordance with their agreement. Finally they resolved to go in again and all have a hand in the killing.\n\nFate, however, had decreed that 's offspring should be the source of ills for , for , standing close to this door, heard all this. Fearing that they would change their minds and that they would take and actually kill the child, she took it away and hid it where she thought it would be hardest to find, in a chest, for she knew that if they returned and set about searching they would seek in every placewhich in fact they did.\nThey came and searched, but when they did not find it, they resolved to go off and say to those who had sent them that they had carried out their orders. They then went away and said this.\n\n\n's son, however, grew up, and because of his escape from that danger, he was called , after the chest. When he had reached manhood and was seeking a divination, an oracle of double meaning was given him at . Putting faith in this, he made an attempt on  and won it.\nThe oracle was as follows:\n\nSuch was the oracle. , however, when he had gained the tyranny, conducted himself in this way: many of the  he drove into exile, many he deprived of their wealth, and by far the most he had killed.\n\nAfter a reign of thirty years, he died in the height of prosperity, and was succeeded by his son . Now  was to begin with milder than his father, but after he had held converse by messenger with  the tyrant of , he became much more bloodthirsty than .\nHe had sent a herald to  and inquired in what way he would best and most safely govern his city.  led the man who had come from  outside the town, and entered into a sown field. As he walked through the corn, continually asking why the messenger had come to him from , he kept cutting off all the tallest ears of wheat which he could see, and throwing them away, until he had destroyed the best and richest part of the crop.\nThen, after passing through the place and speaking no word of counsel, he sent the herald away. When the herald returned to ,  desired to hear what counsel he brought, but the man said that  had given him none. The herald added that it was a strange man to whom he had been sent, a madman and a destroyer of his own possessions, telling  what he had seen  do.\n\n\n, however, understood what had been done, and perceived that  had counselled him to slay those of his townsmen who were outstanding in influence or ability; with that he began to deal with his citizens in an evil manner. Whatever act of slaughter or banishment  had left undone, that  brought to accomplishment. In a single day he stripped all the women of  naked, because of his own wife .\n\n had sent messengers to the Oracle of the Dead on the river  in  to enquire concerning a deposit that a friend had left, but , in an apparition, said that she would tell him nothing, nor reveal where the deposit lay, for she was cold and naked. The garments, she said, with which  had buried with her had never been burnt, and were of no use to her. Then, as evidence for her husband that she spoke the truth, she added that  had put his loaves into a cold oven.\nWhen this message was brought back to  (for he had had intercourse with the dead body of  and knew her token for true), immediately after the message he made a proclamation that all the  women should come out into the temple of . They then came out as to a festival, wearing their most beautiful garments, and  set his guards there and stripped them all alike, ladies and serving-women, and heaped all the clothes in a pit, where, as he prayed to , he burnt them.\nWhen he had done this and sent a second message, the ghost of  told him where the deposit of the friend had been laid. This, then, , is the nature of tyranny, and such are its deeds.\nWe  marvelled greatly when we saw that you were sending for , and now we marvel yet more at your words to us. We entreat you earnestly in the name of the gods of  not to establish tyranny in the cities, but if you do not cease from so doing and unrighteously attempt to bring  back, be assured that you are proceeding without the ' consent.\n\n\nThese were the words of , the envoy from , and  answered, calling the same gods as  had invoked to witness, that the  would be the first to wish the  back, when the time appointed should come for them to be vexed by the .\n\n made this answer, inasmuch as he had more exact knowledge of the oracles than any man, but the rest of the allies, who had till now kept silence, spoke out when they heard the free speech of  and sided with the opinion of the , entreating the  not to harm a  city.\n\n\nHis plan, then, came to nothing, and  was forced to depart.  king of the  offered him , and the  , but he would have neither. He withdrew to , which  had taken at the spear's point from the  and where he then established as tyrant , his own bastard son by an  woman. , however, could not keep what  had given him without fighting,\n\nfor there was constant war over a long period of time between the  at  and the  at . The  were demanding the place back, and the , bringing proof to show that the  had no more part or lot in the land of  than they themselves and all the other  who had aided  to avenge the rape of , would not consent.\n\n\nAmong the various incidents of this war, one in particular is worth mention; In the course of a battle in which the  had the upper hand,  the poet took to flight and escaped, but his armor was taken by the  and hung up in the temple of  at .\n\n wrote a poem about this and sent it to . In it he relates his own misfortune to his friend . As for the  and , however, peace was made between them by  son of , to whose arbitration they committed the matter, and the terms of peace were that each party should keep what it had.\n\n\nIt was in this way, then, that  came to be under  rule, but , having come from  into , left no stone unturned, maligning the  to , and doing all he could to bring  into subjection to himself and .\nWhile  was engaged in these activities, the  heard of it and sent messengers to , warning the  not to believe banished . , however, bade them receive  back, if they wanted to be safe.When his words were brought back to the , they would not consent to them, and since they would not consent, it was resolved that they should be openly at war with .\n\n\nIt was when the  had made their decision and were already on bad terms with , that  the , driven from  by  the , came to , since that city was more powerful than any of the rest. Coming before the people,  spoke to the same effect as at , of the good things of , and how the  carried neither shield nor spear in war and could easily be overcome.\nThis he said adding that the  were settlers from , whom it was only right to save seeing that they themselves were a very powerful people. There was nothing which he did not promise in the earnestness of his entreaty, till at last he prevailed upon them. It seems, then, that it is easier to deceive many than one, for he could not deceive  of , one single man, but thirty thousand  he could.\nThe , now persuaded, voted to send twenty ships to aid the , appointing for their admiral , a citizen of  who had an unblemished reputation. These ships were the beginning of troubles for both  and foreigners.\n\n\n sailed before the rest, and when he came to , he devised a plan from which no advantage was to accrue to the  (nor indeed was that the purpose of his plan, but rather to vex king ). He sent a man into , to the  who had been led captive from the  by , and now dwelt in a  territory and village by themselves. When the man came to the , he spoke as follows:\n\nMen of , I have been sent by , tyrant of , to show you the way to deliverance, if you are disposed to obey. All  is now in revolt against the king, and it is possible for you to win your own way back safely to your own land, but afterwards we will take care of you.\nThe  were very glad when they heard that, and although some of them remained where they were for fear of danger, the rest took their children and women and fled to the sea. After arriving there, the  crossed over to .\nThey were already in , when a great host of  horsemen came after them in pursuit. Unable to overtake them, the  sent to , commanding the  to go back. The  would not consent to this, but were brought from  by the  to  and carried by the  to , from where they made their way by land to .\n\n\nThe  came with their twenty ships as well as five triremes of the  who came to the war to please not the  but the  themselves, thereby repaying their debt (for the  had once been the allies of the  in the war against , when the  came to aid the  against the  and ). When these, then, and the rest of the allies had arrived,  planned a march against .\nHe himself did not go with the army but remained at , and appointed others to be generals of the , namely his own brother  and another citizen named .\n\n\nWhen the  had come to  with this force, they left their ships at  in the  territory and marched inland with a great host, taking  to guide them on their way. They made their way along the river , and after crossing the , they came to  and captured it without any resistance. They took all of it except the citadel, which was held by  himself with a great force of men.\n\n\nThey were prevented from plundering the city by the fact that most of the houses in  were made of reeds, and those made of brick had roofs of reeds. Accordingly, when one of these was seton fire by a soldier, the flames spread from house to house all over the whole city.\nWhile the city was burning, the  and all the  who were in the citadel, being hemmed in on every side since the fire was consuming the outer parts and having no exit from the city, came thronging into the marketplace and to the river , which flows through the marketplace carrying down gold dust from  and issues into the river , which in turn issues into the sea. They assembled in the marketplace by this  and were forced to defend themselves there.\nWhen the  saw some of their enemies defending themselves and a great multitude of others approaching, they were afraid and withdrew to the mountain called , from where they departed to their ships at nightfall.\n\n\nIn the fire at , a temple of , the goddess of that country, was burnt, and the  afterwards made this their pretext for burning the temples of . At this time, the  of the provinces this side of the , on hearing of these matters, gathered together and came to aid the .\nIt chanced that they found the  no longer at , but following on their tracks, they caught them at . There the  stood arrayed to meet them, but were utterly routed in the battle.\nThe  put to the sword many men of renown including  the general of the  who had won crowns as victor in the games and been greatly praised by  of . Those of the  who escaped from the battle fled, each to his city.\n\n\nThis, then is how they fared in their fighting. Presently, however, the  wholly separated themselves from the  and refused to aid them, although  sent messages of earnest entreaty. Despite the fact that they had been deprived of their  allies, the  fervently continued their war against the king (for they remained committed by what they had done to ).\nThey sailed to the  and made  and all the other cities of that region subject to themselves. Then sailing out from the  they gained to their cause the greater part of , for even , which till then had not wanted to be their ally, now joined itself to them after the burning of .\n\n\nThe  did likewise of their own free will, all save the people of , for these too revolted from the  in such manner as I will show. There was a certain , a younger brother of  king of the , son of , whose father was , and grandson of .\nThis man had often before advised  to revolt from , and now when he heard that the  too had revolted, he was insistent in striving to move him. When, however, he could not persuade , he and his faction waited till his brother had gone out of the city of , and shut him out of the gates.\n\n, after having lost his city, took refuge with the , and , now king of , persuaded all  to revolt with him, all save the , who would not consent. He accordingly stationed his forces in front of their city and besieged it.\n\n\n, then, besieged . When it was reported to  that  had been taken and burnt by the  and  and that  the  had been leader of the conspiracy for the making of this plan, he at first, it is said, took no account of the  since he was sure that they would not go unpunished for their rebellion.  did, however, ask who the  were, and after receiving the answer, he called for his bow. This he took and, placing an arrow on it, and shot it into the sky, praying as he sent it aloft,\n\nO , grant me vengeance on the . Then he ordered one of his servants to say to him three times whenever dinner was set before him, Master, remember the .\n\n\nAfter giving this order, he called before him  the , whom  had kept with him for a long time now, and said, I hear, , that the viceregent whom you put in charge of  has done me wrong. He has brought men from the mainland overseas, and persuaded certain who shall yet pay me the penalty for their deedsto follow them and has robbed me of .\nNow then, I ask you, do you think that this state of affairs is good? How did such things come to pass without any advice from your side? See to it that you do not have cause to blame yourself hereafter.\nTo this  answered: My lord, what is this you saythat I and none other should devise a plan as a result of which any harm, great or small, was likely to come to you? What desire or feeling of deprivation would prompt me to do such a thing? All that you have is mine, and I am regarded worthy of hearing all your deliberations.\nIf my vicegerent is indeed doing what you say, be assured that he has acted of his own accord. For myself, I cannot even go so far as to believe the report that the  and my vicegerent are doing you some dreadful wrong. If, however,it is true that they are engaged in such activities and what you, O king, have heard has a basis in fact, then you can see how unwisely you acted when you forced me to leave the coast.\nIt would seem, then, that as soon as I was out of sight, the  did exactly what their hearts had long been set on. If I had been in  no city would have stirred. Now send me off to  right away, so that I may restore that country to peace and deliver into your hands that vicegerent of  who has devised all this.\n\n Then, when I have done this to your satisfaction, I swear by the gods of your royal house that I will not take off the tunic I am wearing on my arrival in  until I have made , the largest of the islands, tributary to you.\n\n\nWith these words  successfully deceived  who gave his consent and let him go, charging  to appear before him at  when he had achieved what he promised.\n\n\nNow while the message concerning  was making its way to the king, and , having done as I said with his bow, held converse with  and permitted him to go to the sea, the following events took place. When  of  was besieging the , news was brought him that , a , was thought to be coming to  with a great  host.\nUpon hearing this,  sent heralds all through  to summon the people, and the , after no long deliberation, came with a great force. So the  were in  when the , crossing from , marched to  by land, and the  were sailing around the headland which is called the keys of .\n\n\nIn this turn of affairs, the tyrants of  called together the generals of the , and said to them: , we  offer you the choice of engaging either the  or the .\nIf you want to draw up your army on land and try your strength against the , then it is time for you to disembark and array yourselves on land and for us to embark in your ships to contend with the . If, however, you desire rather to engage the , do so, but whichever you choose, see to it that  and  become free.\nTo this the  answered, We were sent by the common voice of  to guard the seas, not to deliver our ships to men of  and encounter the  on land. We will attempt then to bear ourselves bravely in the task which was given us. It is for you to prove yourselves valiant men, remembering what you suffered when you were enslaved by the Medians.\n\n\nThis was the ' response, and when the  army afterwards arrived on the plain of , the  kings ordered their battle line. They drew up the best of the  and  against the , leaving the remaining  to face the rest of the enemy's army.  placed himself opposite , the  general.\n\n\nNow the horse which  rode was trained to fight with infantrymen by rearing up. Hearing this,  said to his attendant, a  of great renown in war and a valiant man ,\n\nI learn that ' horse rears up and kicks and bites to death whomever he encounters. In light of this decide and tell me straightway which you will watch and strike down,  himself or his horse.\nTo this his henchman answered, My King, ready am I to do either or both, whatever you desire. Nevertheless, I will tell you what I think is in your best interest.\nTo my mind, a king and general should be met in battle by a king and general (For if you lay low a man who is a general, you have achieved a great feat. Failing that, if he lays you low, as I pray he may not, it is but half the misfortune to be slain by a noble enemy). For us servants it is fitting that we fight with servants like ourselves and with that horse. Do not fear his tricks, for I promise that he will never again do battle with any man.\n\n\nThis, then, was his response, and immediately afterwards war broke out on land and sea. The  in their ships, displaying surpassing excellence that day, overcame the , and it was the  who were most brave. On land, when the armies met, they charged and fought.\nAs for the two generals,  rode against  who as he had agreed with his attendant, dealt  a blow as he bore down upon him. When the horse struck his hooves on ' shield, the  shore away the horse's legs with a stroke of his curved sword.\n\n\nIt was in this way that  the  general, together with his horse, fell. While the rest were still fighting,  the ruler of , allegedly an  settlement, played the traitor with great company of men under him. The war-chariots of the  immediately followed their lead, and the  accordingly gained the upper hand over the .\nSo the army was routed, and many were slain, among them , son of , who had contrived the  revolt, as well as the king of the ,  son of , that  whom  of , when he came to , extolled in a poem above all other tyrants.\n\n\nAs for , the  cut off his head and brought it to , where they hung it above their gates, because he had besieged their city. When this head became hollow, a swarm of bees entered it and filled it with their honeycomb.\nIn consequence of this the , who had inquired concerning the matter, received an oracle which stated that they should take the head down and bury it, and offer yearly sacrifice to  as to a hero. If they did this, things would go better for them.\n\n\nThis the  did, and have done to this day. When, however, the  engaged in the sea-battle off  learned that ' cause was lost and that the cities of , with the exception of  which the  had handed over to their former king , were besieged, they sailed off to  without delay.\n\n was the  city which withstood siege longest; the  took it in the fifth month by digging a mine under its walls.\n\n\nSo the , after winning freedom for a year, were enslaved once more. , , and , all of them  generals and married to daughters of , pursued those  who had marched to , and drove them to their ships. After this victory they divided the cities among themselves and sacked them.\n\n\n made for the cities of the  and took , , , , and , each in a single day. Then as he marched from  against , news came to him that the  had made common cause with the  and revolted from the . For this reason he turned aside from the  and marched his army to .\n\n\nIt so happened that news of this was brought to the  before ' coming, and when the  heard, they mustered at the place called the  by the river  which flows from the region of  and issues into the .\nWhen they had gathered together, many plans were laid before them, the best of which, in my judgment, was that of  of , the son of  and husband of the daughter of , king of . He proposed that the  should cross the  and fight with the river at their back, so that being unable to flee and compelled to stand their ground they might prove themselves even braver than nature made them.\nThis opinion, however, did not prevail, and it was decided instead that the  and not the  should have the  at their back, the intent being that if the  were overcome in the battle and put to flight, they would not escape but be hurled into the river.\n\n\nPresently, when the  had come and had crossed the , they and the  joined battle by the river . The  fought obstinately and for a long time, but at the last they were overcome by the odds. Of the , as many as two thousand men fell, and of the  ten thousand.\nThose of them who escaped were driven into the precinct of  of Armies at , a large and a holy grove of plane-trees. (The  are the only people whom we know who offer sacrifices to  by this name.) When they had been driven there, they deliberated how best to save themselves, whether it would be better for them to surrender to the  or to depart from .\n\n\nWhile they took counsel, the  and their allies came to their aid, whereupon the  put aside their former plans, and prepared to wage a new war over again. They met the  attack and suffered a heavier defeat in the battle than the first; many of their whole army fell, but the  were hardest stricken.\n\n\nThe , however, rallied and fought again after this disaster, for learning that the  had set forth to march against their cities, they beset the road with an ambush at . The  fell into this by night and perished, they and their generals,  and  and . With these fell also , son of . The leader of this ambush was  of , son of .\n\n\nThis, then, is how these  perished. , who had been one of those who went in pursuit of the  who marched on , now turned towards the , and there took  in .\nWhen he had taken this place and heard that  had left the  and was marching towards , he left the  and led his army to the , making himself master of all the  who dwell in the territory of , and of the , a remnant of the ancient . While he was conquering these nations, however,  himself died of a sickness in the .\n\n\nThis is how he met his end, and , viceroy of , and , the third general, were appointed to lead the army against  and the  territory on its borders. They took  in , and  in .\n\n\n the , as he clearly demonstrated, was a man of little courage, for after he had disturbed  and thrown all into utter confusion, he, perceiving what he had done, began to deliberate flight. Moreover, it seemed to him to be impossible to overcome .\nWhile the cities were being taken, he accordingly called his fellow-rebels together and took counsel with them, saying that it was best for them to have some place of refuge in case they should be thrown out of . He also asked them whether he should lead them from there to a settlement in , or  in , which  had received as a gift from  and fortified.\n\n\n the historian, son of , was of the opinion that they should set forth to neither of these places, but that  should build a fortress in the island of  and reside there, if he were driven from . Afterwards, with this as a base, he could return to .\n\n\nSuch was the advice of , but  himself thought it best to depart for . He accordingly entrusted  to , a citizen of repute, and himself sailed to  with any that would follow him and then took possession of the place to which he had come.\n\n After this he was put to the sword by the , he and his army, as he was besieging a town, even though the  were ready to depart from it under treaty."}}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "6", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1", "@unit":

But when they learned the whole story of his hostility to the king, they set him free.\n\n\nThen  was asked by the  why he had so zealously ordered  to revolt from the king and done the  such great harm. He did not at all reveal the true reason to them, telling them instead that king  had planned to remove the  and settle them in , and the  in ; for this reason, he said, he had sent the order.

Thus these men became known, and then  put many  to death.\n\n\nSo troubles arose in . Since he failed in this hope, the  brought  back to  at his own request. But the  were glad enough to be rid of  himself, and they had no wish to receive another tyrant into their country now that they had tasted freedom.\nWhen  tried to force his way into  by night, he was wounded in the thigh by a . Since he was thrust out from his own city, he went back to ; when he could not persuade the  to give him ships, he then crossed over to  and persuaded the  to give him ships.\nThey manned eight triremes, and sailed with  to ; there they encamped, and seized all the ships that were sailing out of the , except when the crews consented to serve .\n\n\nSuch were the doings of  and the . Against  itself a great fleet and army were expected, for the  generals had joined their power together and made one army, which they led against , taking less account of the other fortresses. Of the fleet, the  were the most eager to fight, and there came with them to the war the newly subdued , and the  and .\n\n\nThese were coming to attack  and the rest of . When the  learned of it, they sent deputies to take counsel for them in the .  When they came to that place and consulted, they resolved not to collect a land army to meet the , but to leave the  to defend their walls themselves, and to man their fleet to the last ship and gather as quickly as possible at  to fight for  at sea. This  is a small island lying off the city of .\n\n\nThe  then came there with their ships manned, and with them the  who dwell in . This was their order of battle: The  themselves had the eastern wing, bringing eighty ships; next to them were the  with twelve ships, and the  with three; next to the  were the  with seventeen ships; next to these the  with a hundred; near these in the line were the , bringing eight ships, and the  with three, and next to these the  with seventy; last of all in the line were the , holding the western wing with sixty ships.\nThe total number of all these together was three hundred and fifty-three triremes.\n\n\nThese were the  ships; the ships of the foreigners were six hundred. When these, too, reached the  shore, and all their land power was present, the  generals, learning the number of the  ships, feared they would be too weak to overcome the . If they did not have mastery of the sea, they would not be able to take , and would be in danger of some evil treatment by .\nWith this in mind, they gathered the tyrants of the  who had been deposed from their governments by  of  and had fled to the , and who now were with the army that was led against . They gathered as many of these men as were with them and said to them:\n\nMen of , let each one of you now show that he has done good service to the king's house; let each one of you try to separate your own countrymen from the rest of the allied power.  Set this promise before them: they will suffer no harm for their rebellion, neither their temples nor their houses will be burnt, nor will they in any way be treated more violently than before.\nBut if they will not do so and are set on fighting, then utter a threat that will restrain them: if they are defeated in battle, they will be enslaved; we will make eunuchs of their boys, and carry their maidens captive to , and hand over their land to others.\n\n\nSo they spoke; the  tyrants sent their messages by night, each to his own countrymen. But the  to whom these messages came were stubborn and would have no part of the treachery, each thinking that the  made this offer to them alone. This happened immediately after the  arrived at .\n\n\nThen the  who had gathered at  held assemblies; among those whom I suppose to have addressed them was , the  general, who spoke thus:\n\nOur affairs, men of , stand on the edge of a razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion.\nBelieve me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished.\n\n\nWhen the  heard this, they put themselves in ' hands. He then each day put out to sea with ships in column, using the rowers to pierce each other's line of ships, and arming the fighting men on board; for the rest of the day he kept the fleet at anchor; all day he made the  work.\nFor seven days they obeyed him and did his bidding; but on the next day, untried as they were in such labor and worn out by hard work and by the sun, the  began to say each to other:\n\nAgainst what god have we sinned that we have to fulfill this task? We have lost our minds and launched out into folly, committing ourselves into the hands of this  braggart, who brings but three ships; and having got us he afflicts us with afflictions incurable. Many of us have fallen sick already, and many are likely to suffer the same thing; instead of these ills, it would be better for us to suffer anything, and endure this coming slavery, whatever it will be, rather than be oppressed by that which is now upon us. Come, let us obey him no longer!\nSo they spoke, and from then on no man would obey. As if they were an army, they raised tents on the island where they stayed in the shade, and they were unwilling to embark upon their ships or to continue their exercises.\n\n\nWhen the generals of the  learned what the  were doing, they recalled that message which  son of  had already sent them at the ' bidding, entreating them to desert the  alliance; seeing great disorder on the  side, they consented to the message; moreover, it seemed impossible to them to overcome the king's power, and they were well assured that if they overcame ' present fleet, another one five times as large would come.\nTherefore, as soon as they saw the  refusing to be useful, they took up that for a pretext, considering it advantageous to save their own temples and houses. This , from whom they received the message, was the son of  son of , and had been tyrant of  until he was deposed from his rule by  of , just like the other  tyrants.\n\n\nNow when the  fleet came sailing against them, the  put out to sea against them with their ships in column. When they drew near and met each other in battle, which of the  were brave men or cowards then in that sea-fight I cannot exactly say; for they all blame each other.\nThe  are said, according to their agreement with , to have raised their sails and gone off to , leaving their post, all except eleven ships.\nThe captains of these stood their ground and fought, disobeying their admirals. For this deed the  people granted that their names and patronymics should be engraved on a pillar as brave men; this pillar now stands in their market-place. But the , seeing their neighbors fleeing, did the same as the ; and most of the  did likewise.\n\n\nThe most roughly handled of those that stood their ground in the sea-fight were the , since they refused to be cowards and achieved deeds of renown. They brought a hundred ships to the fleet, as was mentioned above, and on each ship were forty picked men of their citizens.\nSeeing themselves betrayed by the greater part of their allies, they did not think it right to act like the worst among them; with only a few allies to aid them they fought on and broke the enemy's line, until they had taken many ships but lost most of their own.\n\n\nThe  escaped to their own country with their remaining ships, but the crews of the  ships that were damaged and disabled were pursued and took refuge in . There the men beached and left their ships, and made their way across the mainland.\nBut when the  entered the lands of  on their march, they came by night while the women were celebrating the ; then the , never having heard the story of the  and seeing an army invading their country, were fully persuaded that these were robbers come after their women; so they mustered all their force and killed the .\n\n\nSo these men met with such a fate. As for  the , when he saw that the  cause was lost, he sailed away with the three enemy ships that he had captured; but not to , now that he knew well that it would be enslaved with the rest of ; he right away sailed straight to  instead, sunk some merchant ships, took a lot of money, and sailed to ; from this base he set himself up as a pirate, robbing  and , but no .\n\n\nWhen the  had conquered the  by sea, they laid siege to  by sea and land, mining the walls and using every device against it, until they utterly captured it in the sixth year after the revolt of . They enslaved the city, and thus the calamity agreed with the oracle concerning .\n\n\nWhen the  inquired at  about the safety of their city, a common response was given, one part regarding the  themselves, but there was an additional response for the .\nI will mention the part concerning the  when I come to that part of my history; this was the prophecy given to the  in their absence:\n\n\nAll this now came upon the , since most of their men were slain by the , who wore long hair, and their women and children were accounted as slaves, and the temple at  with its shrine and place of divination was plundered and burnt. Of the wealth that was in this temple I have often spoken elsewhere in my history.\n\n\nAfter that, the captive  were brought to .  did them no further harm, settling them by the sea called Red, in the city of , by which the river  flows as it issues into the sea. Of the  land the  themselves held what was nearest to the city, and the plain, giving the hill country into the possession of  from .\n\n\nNow when the  suffered all this at the hands of the , the  (who had lost their city and dwelt in  and ) did not give them equal return for what they had done. When  was taken by the , all the people of , young and old, shaved their heads and made great public lamentation; no cities which we know were ever so closely joined in friendship as these.\nThe  acted very differently. The  made clear their deep grief for the taking of  in many ways, but especially in this: when  wrote a play entitled The Fall of  and produced it, the whole theater fell to weeping; they fined  a thousand drachmas for bringing to mind a calamity that affected them so personally, and forbade the performance of that play forever.\n\n\n then was left empty of . The men of property among the  were displeased by the dealings of their generals with the , so after the sea-fight they took counsel immediately and resolved that before  the tyrant came to their country they would sail to a colony, rather than remain and be slaves of the  and .\nThe people of  in  about this time sent messengers to  inviting the  to the , desiring there to found an  city. This , as it is called, is in , in that part which looks towards . At this invitation, the  alone of the , with those  who had escaped, set forth.\n\n\nIn their journey a thing happened to them such as I will show. As they voyaged to , the  came to the country of the   at a time when the people of  and their king (whose name was Scythes) were besieging a  town desiring to take it.\nLearning this,  the tyrant of , being then in a feud with the , joined forces with the  and persuaded them to leave off their voyage to the  and seize  while it was deserted by its men.\nThe  consented and seized ; when they learned that their city was taken, the  came to deliver it, calling to their aid  the tyrant of , who was their ally.\nBut , when he came bringing his army to aid them, put Scythes the monarch of  and his brother  in chains for losing the city, and sent them away to the city of . He betrayed the rest of the  to the , with whom he had made an agreement and exchanged oaths.\nThe price which the  agreed to give him was that  should take for his share half of the movable goods and slaves in the city, and all that was in the country.\nMost of the  were kept in chains as slaves by  himself; he gave three hundred chief men to the  to be put to death, but the  did not do so.\n\n\nScythes the monarch of  escaped from  to , and from there he came to  and went up country to king .  considered him the most honest man of all who had come up to him from ;\n\n for he returned by the king's permission to  and from  back again to , until in old age he ended his life in  in great wealth. Without trouble the  planted themselves in that most excellent city of , after they had escaped from the .\n\n\nAfter the fight at sea for , the  at the ' bidding brought  son of  back to , for the high worth of his service to them and for his great achievements. Because of the desertion of their ships in the sea-fight, the  were the only rebel people whose city and temples were not burnt.\nAfter  was captured, the  at once gained possession of . Some of the towns submitted voluntarily; others were brought over by force.\n\n\nAll this happened so.  the  was at , seizing the  merchant ships as they sailed out of the , when he had news of the business of . Leaving all matters concerning the  in charge of  of , son of , he himself sailed with the  to  and, when the  guardships would not receive him, fought in the Hollows of  (as they are called).\nMany of their crews he killed; the rest of the people of the country, since they were crippled by the sea-fight, were mastered by  with his , setting out from  in .\n\n\nIt is common for some sign to be given when great ills threaten cities or nations; for before all this plain signs had been sent to the .\nOf a band of a hundred youths whom they had sent to  only two returned, ninety-eight being caught and carried off by pestilence; moreover, at about this same time, a little before the sea-fight, the roof fell in on boys learning their letters: of one hundred and twenty of them one alone escaped.\nThese signs a god showed to them; then the sea-fight broke upon them and beat the city to its knees; on top of the sea-fight came  and the . Since the  were in such a bad state, he easily subdued them.\n\n\nThen  brought a great force of  and  against . While he was besieging  a message came that the  were putting out to sea from  to attack the rest of . When he learned this, he left  unsacked, and hastened instead with all his army to .\nFrom there, since his army suffered from hunger, he crossed over to reap from  the corn there and the  corn of the  plain. Now it chanced that in that region was , a , with no small force under him; when  landed,  met him in battle and took  himself alive and killed most of his army.\n\n\n was taken prisoner in this way: the  fought with the  at  in the country of ; the armies fought for a long time, until the  cavalry charged and fell upon the . So this was the accomplishment of the cavalry; when the  were routed, , supposing that the king would not put him to death for his present transgression, did what showed that he loved his life too well.\nHe was overtaken in his flight by a , and when he was caught and about to be stabbed, he cried out in the  language and revealed himself to be  the .\n\n\nNow if he had been taken prisoner and brought to king , he would have suffered no harm (to my thinking) and the king would have forgiven his guilt; but as it was, when  was brought to , both because of what he had done, and for fear that he might escape and again win power at the court, , governor of , and , who had captured him, impaled his body on the spot, and sent his head embalmed to king  at .\nWhen  learned of this, he blamed those who had done it because they had not brought  before him alive, and he commanded that the head should be washed and buried with due ceremony, as of a man who had done great good to  himself and to .\n\n\nThus it fared with . The  fleet wintered at , and putting out to sea in the next year easily subdued the islands that lie off the mainland,  and  and . Whenever they took an island, the foreigners would (net) the people.\nThis is the manner of their doing it: the men link hands and make a line reaching from the northern sea to the southern, and then advance over the whole island hunting the people down. They also captured the  cities of the mainland in the same way, but not by netting the people; for that was not possible.\n\n\nThen the  generals were not false to the threats they had made against the  when they were encamped opposite them. When they had gained mastery over the cities, they chose out the most handsome boys and castrated them, making them eunuchs instead of men, and they carried the fairest maidens away to the king; they did all this, and they burnt the cities with their temples. Thus three times had the  been enslaved, first by the  and now twice in a row by the .\n\n\nThen the fleet departed from  and captured everything which lies to the left of one sailing up the ; the right side had been subdued by the  themselves from the mainland.

The  burnt the aforementioned places and turned against  and ; after giving these also to the flames they sailed back to the  to finish off the remaining cities, as many as they had not destroyed at their former landing.\nBut they did not sail against  at all; the  had already made themselves the king's subjects before the  expedition, by an agreement with the governor at ,  son of .\n\n\nThe  subdued all the cities in the  except .  son of  son of  was tyrant there.  son of  had gained the rule earlier in the following manner: the  held possession of this . They were crushed in war by the , so they sent their kings to  to inquire about the war.\nThe  answered that they should bring to their land as founder the first man who offered them hospitality after they left the sacred precinct. But as the  passed through  and , going along the , no one invited them, so they turned toward .\n\n\nAt that time in ,  held all power, but  son of  also had great influence. His household was rich enough to maintain a four-horse chariot, and he traced his earliest descent to  and , though his later ancestry was .  son of  was the first of that house to be an .\n\n was sitting on his porch when he saw the  go by with their foreign clothing and spears, so he called out to them, and when they came over, he invited them in for lodging and hospitality. They accepted, and after he entertained them, they revealed the whole story of the oracle to him and asked him to obey the god.\nHe was persuaded as soon as he heard their speech, for he was tired of ' rule and wanted to be away from it. He immediately set out for  to ask the oracle if he should do what the  asked of him.\n\n\nThe  also bade him do so. Then  son of , previously an  victor in the four-horse chariot, recruited any  who wanted to take part in the expedition, sailed off with the , and took possession of their land. Those who brought him appointed him tyrant.\nHis first act was to wall off the isthmus of the  from the city of  across to , so that the  would not be able to harm them by invading their land. The isthmus is thirty-six stadia across, and to the south of the isthmus the  is four hundred and twenty stadia in length.\n\n\nAfter  had pushed away the  by walling off the neck of the , he made war first on the people of , but the  laid an ambush and took him prisoner. However,  stood high in the opinion of  the , and when  heard what had happened, he sent to the  and commanded them to release . If they did not do so, he threatened to cut them down like a pine tree.\nThe  went astray in their counsels as to what the utterance meant which  had threatened them with, saying he would devastate them like a pine tree, until at last one of the elders understood and said what it was: the pine is the only tree that once cut down never sends out any shoots; it is utterly destroyed. So out of fear of  the  released  and let him go.\n\n\nSo he escaped by the intervention of , but he later died childless and left his rule and possessions to , the son of his half-brother . Since his death, the people of the  offer sacrifices to him as their founder in the customary manner, instituting a contest of horse races and gymnastics. No one from  is allowed to compete.\nBut in the war against the   too met his end and died childless; he was struck on the head with an axe in the town-hall by a man who pretended to be a deserter but in truth was an enemy and a man of violence.\n\n\n met his end in this way. The sons of  sent , son of  and brother of the dead , in a trireme to the  to take control of the country; they had already treated him well at , feigning that they had not been accessory to the death of  his father, which I will relate in another place.\nReaching the ,  kept himself within his house, professing thus to honor the memory of his brother . When the people of the  learned this, their ruling men gathered together from all the cities on every side, and came together in a group to show fellow-feeling with his mourning; but he put them in bonds. So  made himself master of the ; there he maintained a guard of five hundred men, and married  the daughter of , king of .\n\n\nBut not long after this  son of  had come to the , greater difficulties than the present afflictions overtook him. He had been driven from the country three years before this by the . The nomadic , provoked by , gathered themselves together and rode as far as the .\n\n did not await their attack and fled from the , until the  departed and the  brought him back again. All this had happened three years before the matters that now engaged him.\n\n\nBut now, learning that the  were in , he sailed away to  with five triremes loaded with the possessions that he had nearby. He set out from  and crossed the , and as he was sailing along the  the  fell upon him with their ships.\n\n himself escaped with four of his ships to , but the fifth was pursued and overtaken by the . It happened that the captain of this ship was , the eldest son of  by another wife, not the daughter of  the .\nThe  took this man captive with his ship; and when they heard that he was ' son, they brought him up to the king, thinking that this would be a very favorable service, because  had declared his opinion among the  that they should obey the  in their demand to break the bridge of boats and sail away to their homes.\nBut when the  brought ' son  before him,  did him no harm but much good, giving him a house and possessions and a  wife, who bore him children who were reckoned as .  made his way from  to .\n\n\nIn this year the  caused no further trouble for the , and at this same time certain things happened which greatly benefited the .  governor of  summoned ambassadors from the cities and compelled the  to make agreements among themselves that they would abide by the law and not rob and plunder each other.\nHe compelled them to do this, and he measured their lands by parasangs, which is the  name for a distance of thirty stadia, and ordered that each people should according to this measurement pay a tribute which has remained fixed as assessed by  ever since that time up to this day; the sum appointed was about the same as that which they had rendered before. This then kept them peaceable.\n\n\nBut at the beginning of spring the other generals were deposed by the king from their offices, and  son of , a man young in years and recently married to ' daughter , came down to the coast at the head of a very great army and fleet.\nWhen  reached  at the head of this army, he himself embarked on shipboard and sailed with the rest of his ships, while other captains led the land army to the .\nWhen  arrived in  in his voyage along the coast of , he did a thing which I here set down for the wonder of those  who will not believe  to have declared his opinion among the Seven that democracy was best for :  deposed all the  tyrants and set up democracies in their cities.\nHe did this and hurried to the . When a great multitude of ships and a great army were assembled, the  crossed the  on shipboard and marched through , with  and  as their goal.\n\n\nThis was the stated end of their expedition, but they intended to subdue as many of the  cities as they could. Their fleet subdued the , who did not so much as lift up their hands against it; their land army added the  to the slaves that they had already, for all the nations nearer to them than  had been made subject to the  before this.\nCrossing over from  they travelled near the land as far as , and putting out from there they tried to round . But a great and irresistible north wind fell upon them as they sailed past and dealt very roughly with them, driving many of their ships upon .\nIt is said that about three hundred ships were lost, and more than twenty thousand men. Since the coasts of  abound in wild beasts, some men were carried off by beasts and so perished; others were dashed against the rocks; those who could not swim perished because of that, and still others by the cold.\n\n\nThus it fared with the fleet; as for  and his land army, while they were encamped in , the  of  attacked them by night and killed many of them, wounding  himself. But not even these could escape being enslaved by the ;  did not depart from those lands before he had subjugated them.\nAfter conquering them, he led his army away homewards, since the  had dealt a heavy blow to his army and  an even heavier blow to his fleet. This expedition after an inglorious adventure returned back to .\n\n\nIn the next year after this,  first sent a message bidding the , who were falsely reported by their neighbors to be planning rebellion, to destroy their walls and bring their ships to .\nSince they had been besieged by  of  and had great revenues, the  had used their wealth to build ships of war and surround themselves with stronger walls.\nTheir revenue came from the mainland and from the mines. About eighty talents on average came in from the gold-mines of the , and less from the mines of  itself, yet so much that the , paying no tax on their crops, drew a yearly revenue from the mainland and the mines of two hundred talents on average, and three hundred when the revenue was greatest.\n\n\nI myself have seen these mines; by far the most marvellous were those that were found by the  who with  colonized this island, which is now called after that .\nThese  mines are between the place called  and  in , opposite ; they are in a great hill that has been dug up in the searching. So much for that. The  at the king's command destroyed their walls and brought all their ships to .\n\n\nThen  attempted to learn whether the  intended to wage war against him or to surrender themselves. He sent heralds this way and that throughout , bidding them demand a gift of earth and water for the king.\nHe despatched some to , and he sent others to his own tributary cities of the coast, commanding that ships of war and transports for horses be built.\n\n\nSo the cities set about these preparations. The heralds who went to  received what the king's proclamation demanded from many of those dwelling on the mainland and from all the islanders to whom they came with the demand. Among the islanders who gave earth and water to  were the .\nThe  immediately came down upon them for doing this, for they supposed the  to have given the gift out of enmity for , so they might join with the  in attacking the . Gladly laying hold of this pretext, they went to  and there accused the  of acting to betray .\n\n\nRegarding this accusation,  son of , king of , crossed over to  intending to arrest the most culpable of its people.\nBut when he attempted to make the arrests, the  opposed him, especially  son of , who told him he would not take away any  with impunity, for he had no authority from the  for what he was doing; instead he had been bribed by the ; otherwise he would have come to make the arrests with the other king. He said this because of a letter from .\nDriven from ,  asked  his name; and when  told him what it was,  said to him, Now is the time to put bronze on your horns, , for great calamity will confront you.\n\n\nAll this time  son of  remained at  and spread evil reports of . This  was also king of , but of the inferior house; not indeed inferior in any other regard (for they have a common ancestor), but the house of  has in some sort the greater honor by right of primogeniture.\n\n\nThe  say (but no poet agrees) that it was  son of  son of  son of , and not his sons, who led them to that land which they now possess.\nAfter no long time ' wife, whose name was , bore him offspring; they say she was daughter of  son of  son of  son of ; she bore him twins;  lived to see the children, then died of a sickness.\nThe  of that day planned to follow their custom and make the eldest of the children king. But the children were identical in all respects, so the  did not know which to choose; when they could not judge between them, or perhaps even before this, they asked the mother.\nShe said she knew no better than the  which was the elder; she knew perfectly well, but she said this because she desired that by some means both might be made kings. The  were at a loss, so they sent to  to inquire how they should deal with the matter.\nThe priestess bade them make both children kings but give greater honor to the elder. When the priestess gave this response, the  knew no better than before how to discover the elder child, and a man of , whose name was , gave them advice:\n\nhe advised them to watch the mother and see which of the children she washed and fed before the other; if she was seen to do this always in the same order, they would then have all that they sought and desired to discover; but if she changed her practice haphazardly, then it would be manifest to the  that she know no more than they did, and they must have recourse to some other means.\nThen the  did as the  advised; as they watched the mother of ' children, they found her always preferring the elder when she fed and washed them, since she did not know why she was being watched. So they took the child that was preferred by its mother and brought it up at public expense as the first-born; and they called it , and the other .\nThey say that when these two brothers grew to manhood, they feuded with each other as long as they lived, and their descendants continued to do likewise.\n\n\nThe  are the only  who tell this story. But in what I write I follow the  report, and hold that the  correctly recount these kings of the  as far back as  son of they make no mention of the god and prove these kings to be ; for by that time they had come to be classified as .\nI said as far back as , and I took the matter no further than that, because no one is named as the mortal father of , as  is named father of . So I used correct reasoning when I said that the  record is correct as far back as ; farther back than that, if the king's ancestors in each generation, from  daughter of  upward, be reckoned, then the leaders of the  will be shown to be true-born .\n\n\nThus have I traced their lineage according to the  story; but the  tale is that  himself was an , and became a , which his forebears had not been; the  say that the ancestors of  had no bond of kinship with , and they indeed were, as the  say, .\n\n\nEnough of these matters. Why and for what achievements these men, being , won the kingship of the  has been told by others, so I will let it go, and will make mention of matters which others have not touched.\n\n\nThese privileges the  have given to their kings: two priesthoods, of  called  and of  of Heaven; they wage war against whatever land they wish, and no  can hinder them in this on peril of being put under a curse; when the armies go forth the kings go out first and return last; one hundred chosen men guard them in their campaigns; they sacrifice as many sheep and goats as they wish at the start of their expeditions, and take the hides and backs of all sacrificed beasts.\n\n\nSuch are their rights in war; in peace the powers given them are as follows: at all public sacrifices the kings first sit down to the banquet and are first served, each of them receiving a portion double of what is given to the rest of the company; they make the first libations, and the hides of the sacrificed beasts are theirs.\nAt each new moon and each seventh day of the first part of the month, a full-grown victim for 's temple, a bushel of barley-meal, and a  quart of wine are given to each from the public store, and chief seats are set apart for them at the games.\nIt is their right to appoint whatever citizens they wish to be protectors of foreigners; and they each choose two . (The  are the ambassadors to  and eat with the kings at the public expense.)  If the kings do not come to the public dinner, two choenixes of barley-meal and half a pint of wine are sent to their houses, but when they come, they receive a double share of everything; and the same honor shall be theirs when they are invited by private citizens to dinner.\nThey keep all oracles that are given, though the  also know them. The kings alone judge cases concerning the rightful possessor of an unwedded heiress, if her father has not betrothed her, and cases concerning public roads.\nIf a man desires to adopt a son, it is done in the presence of the kings. They sit with the twenty-eight elders in council; if they do not come, the elders most closely related to them hold the king's privilege, giving two votes over and above the third which is their own.\n\n\nThe kings are granted these rights from the  commonwealth while they live; when they die, their rights are as follows: Horsemen proclaim their death in all parts of , and in the city women go about beating on cauldrons. When this happens, two free persons from each house, a man and a woman, are required to wear mourning, or incur heavy penalties if they fail to do so.\nThe  have the same custom at the deaths of their kings as the foreigners in ; most foreigners use the same custom at their kings' deaths. When a king of the  dies, a fixed number of their subject neighbors must come to the funeral from all , besides the .\nWhen these and the helots and the  themselves have assembled in one place to the number of many thousands, together with the women, they zealously beat their foreheads and make long and loud lamentation, calling that king that is most recently dead the best of all their kings. Whenever a king dies in war, they make an image of him and carry it out on a well-spread bier. For ten days after the burial there are no assemblies or elections, and they mourn during these days.\n\n\nThe  also resemble the  in this: when one king is dead and another takes his office, this successor releases from debt any  who owes a debt to the king or to the commonwealth. Among the  the king at the beginning of his reign forgives all cities their arrears of tribute.\n\n\nThe  resemble the  in that their heralds and flute-players and cooks inherit the craft from their fathers, a flute-player's son being a flute-player, and a cook's son a cook, and a herald's son a herald; no others usurp their places, making themselves heralds by loudness of voice; they ply their craft by right of birth. Such is the way of these matters.\n\n\nWhile  was in  working for the common good of ,  slandered him, not out of care for the , but out of jealousy and envy. Once  returned home from , he planned to remove  from his kingship, using the following affair as a pretext against him: , king of , had married twice but had no children.\nHe did not admit that he himself was responsible, so he married a third time. This is how it came about: he had among the  a friend to whom he was especially attached. This man's wife was by far the most beautiful woman in , but she who was now most beautiful had once been the ugliest.\nHer nurse considered her inferior looks and how she was of wealthy people yet unattractive, and, seeing how the parents felt her appearance to be a great misfortune, she contrived to carry the child every day to the sacred precinct of , which is in the place called , beyond the sacred precinct of . Every time the nurse carried the child there, she set her beside the image and beseeched the goddess to release the child from her ugliness.\nOnce as she was leaving the sacred precinct, it is said that a woman appeared to her and asked her what she was carrying in her arms. The nurse said she was carrying a child and the woman bade her show it to her, but she refused, saying that the parents had forbidden her to show it to anyone. But the woman strongly bade her show it to her,\n\nand when the nurse saw how important it was to her, she showed her the child. The woman stroked the child's head and said that she would be the most beautiful woman in all . From that day her looks changed, and when she reached the time for marriage,  son of  married her. This man was 's friend.\n\n\nSo love for this woman pricked , and he contrived as follows: He promised to give to his comrade any one thing out of all he owned, whatever  might choose, and he bade his comrade make him the same promise.  had no fear about his wife, seeing that  was already married, so he agreed and they took oaths on these terms.\n\n gave  whatever it was that he chose out of all his treasures, and then, seeking equal recompense from him, tried to take the wife of his comrade.  said that he had agreed to anything but that, but he was forced by his oath and by the deceitful trick to let his wife be taken.\n\n\nIn this way  married his third wife, after divorcing the second one. But his new wife gave birth to  too soon, before ten lunar months had passed.\nWhen one of his servants announced to him as he sat in council with the ephors that he had a son, , knowing the time of the marriage, counted up the months on his fingers and swore on oath, It's not mine. The ephors heard this but did not make anything of it. When the boy grew up,  regretted having said that, for he firmly believed  to be his own son.\nHe named him  because before his birth all the  populace had prayed that , the man most highly esteemed out of all the kings of , might have a son. Thus he was named , which means answer to the people's prayer.\n\n\nTime passed and  died, so  held the kingship. But it seems that these matters had to become known and cause  to lose his kingship. He had already fallen out with  when he had brought the army back from , and now they were even more at odds when  crossed over after the  who were Medizing.\n\n\n wanted revenge, so he made a deal with  son of  son of , of the same family as . The deal was that  would go with  against the  if he became king.\n\n had already become strongly hostile to  for the following reason:  was betrothed to , daughter of , but  plotted and robbed him of his marriage, stealing  and marrying her first.\nFrom this affair  was hostile toward , so at ' instigation he took an oath against him, saying that he was not king of the  by right, since he was not 's son. After making this oath, he prosecuted him, recalling that utterance which  had made when the servant told him he had a son, and he counted up the months and swore that it was not his.\nTaking his stand on this remark,  declared that  was not 's son and that he was not rightly king of , bringing as witnesses the ephors who had been sitting beside  and heard him say this.\n\n\nDisputes arose over it, so the  resolved to ask the oracle at  if  was the son of .\nAt ' instigation this was revealed to the . He had won over a man of great influence among the ,  son of , and  persuaded the priestess, , to say what  wanted her to.\nWhen the ambassadors asked if  was the son of , the  gave judgment that he was not. All this came to light later;  was exiled from , and  was deposed from her position.\n\n\nSo it was concerning ' loss of the kingship, and from  he went into exile among the  because of the following reproach: after he was deposed from the kingship, he was elected to office.\nWhen it was the time of the , , now king in his place, saw him in the audience and, as a joke and an insult, sent a messenger to him to ask what it was like to hold office after being king.\nHe was grieved by the question and said that he had experience of both, while  did not, and that this question would be the beginning for  of either immense evil or immense good fortune. He said this, covered his head, left the theater, and went home, where he immediately made preparations and sacrificed an ox to . Then he summoned his mother.\n\n\nWhen she came in, he put some of the entrails in her hands and entreated her, saying, Mother, appealing to  of the household and to all the other gods, I beseech you to tell me the truth. Who is my father? Tell me truly.\n\n said in the disputes that you were already pregnant by your former husband when you came to . Others say more foolishly that you approached to one of the servants, the ass-keeper, and that I am his son.\nI adjure you by the gods to speak what is true. If you have done anything of what they say, you are not the only one; you are in company with many women. There is much talk at  that  did not have child-bearing seed in him, or his former wives would have given him children.\n\n\nThus he spoke. His mother answered, My son, since you adjure me by entreaties to speak the truth, I will speak out to you all that is true. On the third night after  brought me to his house, a phantom resembling him came to me. It came and lay with me and then put on me the garlands which it had.\nIt went away, and when  came in later and saw me with the garlands, he asked who gave them to me. I said he did, but he denied it. I swore an oath that just a little while before he had come in and lain with me and given me the garlands, and I said it was not good of him to deny it.\nWhen he saw me swearing, he perceived that this was some divine affair. For the garlands had clearly come from the hero's precinct which is established at the courtyard doors, which they call the precinct of , and the seers responded that this was the same hero who had come to me. Thus, my son, you have all you want to know.\nEither you are from this hero and  the hero is your father, or  is, for I conceived you that night. As for how your enemies chiefly attack you, saying that  himself, when your birth was announced, denied in front of a large audience that you were his because the ten months had not yet been completed, he spoke an idle word, out of ignorance of such things.\nSome women give birth after nine months or seven months; not all complete the ten months. I gave birth to you, my son, after seven months. A little later  himself recognized that he had blurted out that speech because of foolishness. Do not believe other stories about your manner of birth. You have heard the whole truth. May the wife of  himself, and the wives of the others who say these things, give birth to children fathered by ass-keepers.\n\n\nThus his mother spoke. After learning what he desired,  took provisions and travelled to , pretending that he was going to  to inquire of the oracle. But the  suspected that he planned to escape and went in pursuit.\n\n somehow went across to  from  before them; the  crossed over after him and laid hands on him, carrying off his servants. But the  refused to give him up, and later he crossed from there to  and went to king , who received him in grand style and gave him lands and cities.\nSo  reached  through such chances, a man who had gained much renown in  by his many achievements and his wisdom, and by conferring on the state the victory in a chariot-race he had won at ; he was the only king of  who did this.\n\n\n son of  succeeded to the kingship after  was deposed. A son was born to him, , called by some of the  . This  never became king of , for he died before , leaving his son .\nAfter the loss of ,  married a second wife, , sister of  and daughter of ; by her he had no male offspring, but a daughter, , to whom  son of  was married by .\n\n\nBut  also did not come to old age in ; he was punished for his dealings with  as I will show. He led a  army to , and when he could have subdued all the country he took a great bribe.\nAfter being caught in the act of hoarding a sleeve full of silver there in the camp, he was brought before a court and banished from , and his house was destroyed. He went into exile at  and died in that country.\n\n\nThis happened long afterwards. When ' dealings with  came off successfully, he immediately took  with him and went to punish the , with whom he was terribly angry because of their insulting behavior.\nWhen the  saw that both kings had come after them, they now deemed it best to offer no further resistance; the kings chose ten men of  who were most honored for wealth and lineage, among them  son of  and  son of , the two most powerful men in ; they carried them to  and gave them into the keeping of the , the bitterest foes of the .\n\n\nLater ' treacherous plot against  became known; he was seized with fear of the  and secretly fled to . From there he came to  and stirred up disorder, uniting the  against ; among his methods of binding them by oath to follow him wherever he led was his zeal to bring the chief men of  to the city of  and make them swear by the water of the .\nNear this city is said to be the  water of the , and this is its nature: it is a stream of small appearance, dropping from a cliff into a pool; a wall of stones runs round the pool. , where this spring rises, is a city of  near .\n\n\nWhen the  learned that  was doing this, they took fright and brought him back to  to rule on the same terms as before.  had already been not entirely in his right mind, and on his return from exile a mad sickness fell upon him: any  that he happened to meet he would hit in the face with his staff.\nFor doing this, and because he was out of his mind, his relatives bound him in the stocks. When he was in the stocks and saw that his guard was left alone, he demanded a dagger; the guard at first refused to give it, but  threatened what he would do to him when he was freed, until the guard, who was a helot, was frightened by the threats and gave him the dagger.\n\n took the weapon and set about slashing himself from his shins upwards; from the shin to the thigh he cut his flesh lengthways, then from the thigh to the hip and the sides, until he reached the belly, and cut it into strips; thus he died, as most of the  say, because he persuaded the  priestess to tell the tale of . The  alone say it was because he invaded  and laid waste the precinct of the gods. The  say it was because when  had taken refuge after the battle in their temple of  he brought them out and cut them down, then paid no heed to the sacred grove and set it on fire.\n\n\nAs  was seeking divination at , the oracle responded that he would take . When he came with  to the river , which is said to flow from the  lake (this lake issues into a cleft out of sight and reappears at , and from that place onwards the stream is called by the  )when  came to this river he offered sacrifices to it.\nThe omens were in no way favorable for his crossing, so he said that he honored the  for not betraying its countrymen, but even so the  would not go unscathed. Then he withdrew and led his army seaward to , where he sacrificed a bull to the sea and carried his men on shipboard to the region of  and to .\n\n\nThe  heard of this and came to the coast to do battle with him. When they had come near  and were at the place called , they encamped opposite the , leaving only a little space between the armies. There the  had no fear of fair fighting, but rather of being captured by a trick.\nThis was the affair referred to by that oracle which the  priestess gave to the  and  in common, which ran thus:\n\n\nAll these things coming together spread fear among the . Therefore they resolved to defend themselves by making use of the enemies' herald, and they performed their resolve in this way: whenever the  herald signalled anything to the , the  did the same thing.\n\n\nWhen  saw that the  did whatever was signalled by his herald, he commanded that when the herald cried the signal for breakfast, they should then put on their armor and attack the .\nThe  performed this command, and when they assaulted the  they caught them at breakfast in obedience to the herald's signal; they killed many of them, and far more fled for refuge into the grove of , which the  encamped around and guarded.\n\n\nThen ' plan was this: He had with him some deserters from whom he learned the names, then he sent a herald calling by name the  that were shut up in the sacred precinct and inviting them to come out, saying that he had their ransom. (Among the  there is a fixed ransom of two minae to be paid for every prisoner.) So  invited about fifty  to come out one after another and murdered them.\nSomehow the rest of the men in the temple precinct did not know this was happening, for the grove was thick and those inside could not see how those outside were faring, until one of them climbed a tree and saw what was being done. Thereafter they would not come out at the herald's call.\n\n\nThen  bade all the helots pile wood about the grove; they obeyed, and he burnt the grove. When the fire was now burning, he asked of one of the deserters to what god the grove belonged; the man said it was of . When he heard that, he groaned aloud, , god of oracles, you have gravely deceived me by saying that I would take ; this, I guess, is the fulfillment of that prophecy.\n\n\nThen  sent most of his army back to , while he himself took a thousand of the best warriors and went to the temple of  to sacrifice. When he wished to sacrifice at the altar the priest forbade him, saying that it was not holy for a stranger to sacrifice there.  ordered the helots to carry the priest away from the altar and whip him, and he performed the sacrifice. After doing this, he returned to .\n\n\nBut after his return his enemies brought him before the ephors, saying that he had been bribed not to take  when he might have easily taken it.  alleged (whether falsely or truly, I cannot rightly say; but this he alleged in his speech) that he had supposed the god's oracle to be fulfilled by his taking of the temple of ; therefore he had thought it best not to make any attempt on the city before he had learned from the sacrifices whether the god would deliver it to him or withstand him;\n\nwhen he was taking omens in 's temple a flame of fire had shone forth from the breast of the image, and so he learned the truth of the matter, that he would not take . If the flame had come out of the head of the image, he would have taken the city from head to foot utterly; but its coming from the breast signified that he had done as much as the god willed to happen. This plea of his seemed to the  to be credible and reasonable, and he far outdistanced the pursuit of his accusers.\n\n\nBut  was so wholly deprived of men that their slaves took possession of all affairs, ruling and governing until the sons of the slain men grew up. Then they recovered  for themselves and cast out the slaves; when they were driven out, the slaves took possession of  by force.\nFor a while they were at peace with each other; but then there came to the slaves a prophet, , a man of  in  by birth; he persuaded the slaves to attack their masters. From that time there was a long-lasting war between them, until with difficulty the  got the upper hand.\n\n\nThe  say this was the reason  went mad and met an evil end; the  themselves say that ' madness arose from no divine agent, but that by consorting with  he became a drinker of strong wine, and the madness came from this.\nThe nomadic , after  had invaded their land, were eager for revenge, so they sent to  and made an alliance. They agreed that the  would attempt to invade Media by way of the river , and they urged the  to set out and march inland from  and meet the .\nThey say that when the  had come for this purpose,  kept rather close company with them, and by consorting with them more than was fitting he learned from them to drink strong wine. The  consider him to have gone mad from this. Ever since, as they themselves say, whenever they desire a strong drink they call for a  cup. Such is the  story of ; but to my thinking it was for what he did to  that he was punished thus.\n\n\nWhen the  heard that  was dead, they sent messengers to  to cry out against  concerning the hostages that were held at . The  then assembled a court and gave judgment that  had done violence to the ; and they condemned him to be given up and carried to  in requital for the men that were held at .\nBut when the  were about to carry  away, a man of repute at ,  son of , said to them, Men of , what are you planning to do? To have the king of the  given up to you by the citizens and carry him away? If the  have now so judged in their anger, see that they do not bring utter destruction upon your country if you do this.\nThe  heard this and refrained from carrying the king away, and made an agreement that  should go with them to  and restore the men to the .\n\n\nWhen  came to  and demanded back the hostages, the  were unwilling to give them back and made excuses, saying that two kings had given them the trust and they deemed it wrong to restore it to one without the other.\n\nWhen the  refused to give them back,  said to them: Men of , do whichever thing you desire. If you give them back, you do righteously; if you do not give them back, you do the opposite. But I want to tell you the story of what happened at  in the matter of a trust.\nWe  say that three generations ago there was at  one , the son of . We say that this man added to his other excellences a reputation for justice above all men who at that time dwelt in .\nBut we say that at the fitting time this befell him: There came to  a certain man of , who desired to have a talk with  and made him this offer: I am a , and I have come to have the benefit of your justice, .\nSince there is much talk about your justice throughout all the rest of , and even in , I considered the fact that  is always in danger while the  is securely established, and nowhere in  are the same men seen continuing in possession of wealth.\nConsidering and taking counsel concerning these matters, I resolved to turn half of my property into silver and deposit it with you, being well assured that it will lie safe for me in your keeping. Accept the money for me, and take and keep these tokens; restore the money to whoever comes with the same tokens and demands it back.\n\nThus spoke the stranger who had come from , and  received the trust according to the agreement. After a long time had passed, the sons of the man who had deposited the money came to ; they spoke with , showing him the tokens and demanding the money back.\nBut  put them off and answered in turn: I do not remember the matter, and nothing of what you say carries my mind back. Let me think; I wish to do all that is just. If I took the money, I will duly restore it; if I never took it at all, I will deal with you according to the customs of the . I will put off making my decision for you until the fourth month from this day.\n\nSo the  went away in sorrow, as men robbed of their possessions; but  journeyed to  to question the oracle. When he asked the oracle whether he should seize the money under oath, the  priestess threatened him in these verses:\n\n\n\nWhen  heard this, he entreated the god to pardon him for what he had said. The priestess answered that to tempt the god and to do the deed had the same effect.\n\nSo  summoned the  strangers and gave them back their money. But hear now, , why I began to tell you this story: there is today no descendant of , nor any household that bears ' name; he has been utterly rooted out of . So good is it not even to think anything concerning a trust except giving it back on demand!\n\n\nThus spoke ; but even so the  would not listen to him, and he departed. The , before paying the penalty for the violence they had done to the  to please the , acted as follows: blaming the  and deeming themselves wronged, they prepared to take vengeance on the , who were now celebrating a quinquennial festival at . The  set an ambush and captured the sacred ship, with many leading  on board, and put in prison the men they seized.\n\n\nSuffering this from the , the  no longer put off devising all mischief against . There was a notable man in ,  son of  by name, who held a grudge against the  for his former banishment from the island. When he learned that the  were now set upon harming the , he agreed to betray  to the , naming the day when he would make the attempt and when they must come to aid him.\n\n\nLater , according to his agreement with the , took possession of the , as it was called; but the  were not there at the right time, for they did not have ships worthy to fight the . While they were asking the  to lend them ships, the affair was ruined. The  at that time were their close friends, so they consented to the ' plea and gave them twenty ships, at a price of five drachmas apiece; by their law they could not make a free gift of them. Taking these ships and their own, the  manned seventy in all and sailed for , but they came a day later than the time agreed.\n\n\nWhen the  did not show up at the right time,  took ship and escaped from . Other  followed him, and the  gave them  to dwell in; setting out from there they harried the  of the island.\n\n\nBut this happened later. The rich men of  gained mastery over the people, who had risen against them with , then made them captive and led them out to be killed. Because of this a curse fell upon them, which despite all their efforts they could not get rid of by sacrifice, and they were driven out of their island before the goddess would be merciful to them.\nThey had taken seven hundred of the people alive; as they led these out for slaughter one of them escaped from his bonds and fled to the temple gate of  the Lawgiver, where he laid hold of the door-handles and clung to them. They could not tear him away by force, so they cut off his hands and carried him off, and those hands were left clinging fast to the door-handles.\n\n\nThus the  dealt with each other. When the  came, they fought them at sea with seventy ships; the  were defeated in the sea-fight and asked for help from the , as they had done before. But this time the  would not aid them, holding a grudge because ships of  had been taken by force by  and put in on the  coast, where their crews landed with the ; men from ships of  also took part in the same invasion.\nThe  laid on them the payment of a fine of a thousand talents, five hundred each. The  confessed that they had done wrong and agreed to go free with a payment of a hundred talents, but the  made no such confession and remained stubborn. For this cause the  state sent no one to aid them at their request, but about a thousand came voluntarily, led by a captain whose name was , a man who practiced the pentathlon.\nMost of these never returned, meeting their death at the hands of the  in ;  himself, their captain, fought in single combat and thus killed three men, but was slain by the fourth,  the son of .\n\n\nThe  ships found the  in disarray and attacked and overcame them, taking four  ships and their crews.\n\n\nThus  and  grappled together in war. The  was going about his own business, for his servant was constantly reminding him to remember the , and the  were at his elbow maligning the ; moreover,  desired to take this pretext for subduing all the men of  who had not given him earth and water.\nHe dismissed from command , who had fared so badly on his expedition, and appointed other generals to lead his armies against  and , , a  by birth, and his own nephew  son of ; the order he gave them at their departure was to enslave  and  and bring the slaves into his presence.\n\n\nWhen these appointed generals on their way from the king reached the  plain in , bringing with them a great and well-furnished army, they camped there and were overtaken by all the fleet that was assigned to each; there also arrived the transports for horses, which in the previous year  had bidden his tributary subjects to make ready.\nHaving loaded the horses into these, and embarked the land army in the ships, they sailed to  with six hundred triremes. From there they held their course not by the mainland and straight towards the  and , but setting forth from  they sailed by the  and from island to island; this, to my thinking, was because they feared above all the voyage around , seeing that in the previous year they had come to great disaster by holding their course that way; moreover,  was still unconquered and constrained them.\n\n\nWhen they approached  from the  and came to land (for it was  which the  intended to attack first), the , remembering what had happened before, fled away to the mountains instead of waiting for them. The  enslaved all of them that they caught, and burnt their temples and their city. After doing this, they set sail for the other islands.\n\n\nWhile they did this, the  also left  and fled away to . As his expedition was sailing landwards,  went on ahead and bade his fleet anchor not off , but across the water off . Learning where the  were, he sent a herald to them with this proclamation:\n\nHoly men, why have you fled away, and so misjudged my intent? It is my own desire, and the king's command to me, to do no harm to the land where the two gods were born, neither to the land itself nor to its inhabitants. So return now to your homes and dwell on your island. He made this proclamation to the , and then piled up three hundred talents of frankincense on the altar and burnt it.\n\n\nAfter doing this,  sailed with his army against  first, taking with him  and ; and after he had put out from there,  was shaken by an earthquake, the first and last, as the  say, before my time. This portent was sent by heaven, as I suppose, to be an omen of the ills that were coming on the world.\nFor in three generations, that is, in the time of  son of  and  son of  and  son of , more ills happened to  than in twenty generations before ; some coming from the , some from the wars for preeminence among the chief of the nations themselves.\nThus it was no marvel that there should be an earthquake in  when there had been none before. Also there was an oracle concerning , where it was written:\n\n In the  language these names have the following meanings:  is the Doer,  the Warrior,  the . The  would rightly call the kings thus in their language.\n\n\nLaunching out to sea from , the foreigners put in at the islands and gathered an army from there, taking the sons of the islanders for hostages.\nWhen in their voyage about the islands they put in at , the  gave them no hostages and refused to join them against neighboring cities, meaning  and ; the  besieged them and laid waste their land, until the  too came over to their side.\n\n\nWhen the  learned that the  expedition was sailing to attack them, they asked for help from the . The  did not refuse the aid, but gave them for defenders the four thousand tenant farmers who held the land of the  horse-breeders.  But it seems that all the plans of the  were unsound; they sent to the  for aid, but their counsels were divided.\nSome of them planned to leave the city and make for the heights of ; others plotted treason in hope of winning advantages from the .\nWhen  son of , a leading man in , learned of both designs, he told the  who had come how matters stood, and asked them to depart to their own country so they would not perish like the rest. The  followed ' advice.\n\n\nSo they saved themselves by crossing over to ; the  sailed holding their course for  and  and , all in  territory. Landing at these places, they immediately unloaded their horses and made preparation to attack their enemies.\nThe  had no intention of coming out and fighting; all their care was to guard their walls if they could, since it was the prevailing counsel not to leave the city. The walls were strongly attacked, and for six days many fell on both sides; but on the seventh two  of repute,  son of  and  son of , betrayed the city to the .\nThey entered the city and plundered and burnt the temples, in revenge for the temples that were burnt at ; moreover, they enslaved the townspeople, according to ' command.\n\n\nAfter subduing , the  waited a few days and then sailed away to the land of , pressing ahead in expectation of doing to the  exactly what they had done to the . Marathon was the place in  most suitable for riding horses and closest to , so  son of  led them there.\n\n\nWhen the  learned this, they too marched out to Marathon, with ten generals leading them. The tenth was , and it had befallen his father  son of  to be banished from  by  son of .\nWhile in exile he happened to take the  prize in the four-horse chariot, and by taking this victory he won the same prize as his half-brother . At the next  games he won with the same horses but permitted  to be proclaimed victor, and by resigning the victory to him he came back from exile to his own property under truce.\nAfter taking yet another  prize with the same horses, he happened to be murdered by ' sons, since  was no longer living. They murdered him by placing men in ambush at night near the town-hall.  was buried in front of the city, across the road called Through the Hollow, and buried opposite him are the mares who won the three  prizes.\nThe mares of  the  did the same as these, but none others. , the elder of 's sons, was then being brought up with his uncle  in the . The younger was with  at , and he took the name  from  the founder of the .\n\n\nIt was this  who was now the  general, after coming from the  and escaping a two-fold death. The  pursued him as far as , considering it of great importance to catch him and bring him to the king.\nHe escaped from them, but when he reached his own country and thought he was safe, then his enemies met him. They brought him to court and prosecuted him for tyranny in the , but he was acquitted and appointed  general, chosen by the people.\n\n\nWhile still in the city, the generals first sent to  the herald , an  and a long-distance runner who made that his calling. As  himself said when he brought the message to the , when he was in the  above  he encountered Pan.\nPan called out ' name and bade him ask the  why they paid him no attention, though he was of goodwill to the , had often been of service to them, and would be in the future.\nThe  believed that these things were true, and when they became prosperous they established a sacred precinct of Pan beneath the Acropolis. Ever since that message they propitiate him with annual sacrifices and a torch-race.\n\n\nThis  was in  on the day after leaving the city of , that time when he was sent by the generals and said that Pan had appeared to him. He came to the magistrates and said,\n\n, the  ask you to come to their aid and not allow the most ancient city among the  to fall into slavery at the hands of the foreigners. Even now  has been enslaved, and  has become weaker by an important city.\nHe told them what he had been ordered to say, and they resolved to send help to the , but they could not do this immediately, for they were unwilling to break the law. It was the ninth day of the rising month, and they said that on the ninth they could not go out to war until the moon's circle was full.\n\n\nSo they waited for the full moon, while the foreigners were guided to Marathon by  son of . The previous night  had a dream in which he slept with his mother.\nHe supposed from the dream that he would return from exile to , recover his rule, and end his days an old man in his own country. Thus he reckoned from the dream. Then as guide he unloaded the slaves from  onto the island of the  called , and brought to anchor the ships that had put ashore at Marathon, then marshalled the foreigners who had disembarked onto land.\nAs he was tending to this, he happened to sneeze and cough more violently than usual. Since he was an elderly man, most of his teeth were loose, and he lost one of them by the force of his cough. It fell into the sand and he expended much effort in looking for it, but the tooth could not be found.\n\n He groaned aloud and said to those standing by him: This land is not ours and we will not be able to subdue it. My tooth holds whatever share of it was mine.\n\n\n supposed that the dream had in this way come true. As the  were marshalled in the precinct of , the  came to help them in full force. The  had put themselves under the protection of the , and the  had undergone many labors on their behalf. This is how they did it:\n\nwhen the  were pressed by the , they first tried to put themselves under the protection of  son of  and the , who happened to be there. But they did not accept them, saying, We live too far away, and our help would be cold comfort to you. You could be enslaved many times over before any of us heard about it.\nWe advise you to put yourselves under the protection of the , since they are your neighbors and not bad men at giving help. The  gave this advice not so much out of goodwill toward the  as wishing to cause trouble for the  with the .\nSo the  gave this advice to the , who did not disobey it. When the  were making sacrifices to the twelve gods, they sat at the altar as suppliants and put themselves under protection. When the  heard this, they marched against the , but the  came to their aid.\nAs they were about to join battle, the , who happened to be there, prevented them and brought about a reconciliation. Since both sides desired them to arbitrate, they fixed the boundaries of the country on condition that the  leave alone those  who were unwilling to be enrolled as .  After rendering this decision, the  departed. The  attacked the  as they were leaving but were defeated in battle.\nThe  went beyond the boundaries the  had made for the , fixing the  as the boundary for the  in the direction of  and . So the  had put themselves under the protection of the  in the aforesaid manner, and now came to help at Marathon.\n\n\nThe  generals were of divided opinion, some advocating not fighting because they were too few to attack the army of the ; others, including , advocating fighting.\nThus they were at odds, and the inferior plan prevailed. An eleventh man had a vote, chosen by lot to be polemarch of , and by ancient custom the  had made his vote of equal weight with the generals.  of  was polemarch at this time.  approached him and said,\n\n, it is now in your hands to enslave  or make her free, and thereby leave behind for all posterity a memorial such as not even  and  left. Now the  have come to their greatest danger since they first came into being, and, if we surrender, it is clear what we will suffer when handed over to . But if the city prevails, it will take first place among  cities.\nI will tell you how this can happen, and how the deciding voice on these matters has devolved upon you. The ten generals are of divided opinion, some urging to attack, others urging not to.\nIf we do not attack now, I expect that great strife will fall upon and shake the spirit of the , leading them to medize. But if we attack now, before anything unsound corrupts the , we can win the battle, if the gods are fair.\nAll this concerns and depends on you in this way: if you vote with me, your country will be free and your city the first in . But if you side with those eager to avoid battle, you will have the opposite to all the good things I enumerated.\n\n\nBy saying this  won over . The polemarch's vote was counted in, and the decision to attack was resolved upon. Thereafter the generals who had voted to fight turned the presidency over to  as each one's day came in turn. He accepted the office but did not make an attack until it was his own day to preside.\n\n\nWhen the presidency came round to him, he arrayed the  for battle, with the polemarch  commanding the right wing, since it was then the  custom for the polemarch to hold the right wing. He led, and the other tribes were numbered out in succession next to each other. The  were marshalled last, holding the left wing.\nEver since that battle, when the  are conducting sacrifices at the festivals every fourth year, the  herald prays for good things for the  and  together.\nAs the  were marshalled at Marathon, it happened that their line of battle was as long as the line of the . The center, where the line was weakest, was only a few ranks deep, but each wing was strong in numbers.\n\n\nWhen they had been set in order and the sacrifices were favorable, the  were sent forth and charged the foreigners at a run. The space between the armies was no less than eight stadia.\nThe  saw them running to attack and prepared to receive them, thinking the  absolutely crazy, since they saw how few of them there were and that they ran up so fast without either cavalry or archers.\nSo the foreigners imagined, but when the  all together fell upon the foreigners they fought in a way worthy of record. These are the first  whom we know of to use running against the enemy. They are also the first to endure looking at Median dress and men wearing it, for up until then just hearing the name of the  caused the  to panic.\n\n\nThey fought a long time at Marathon. In the center of the line the foreigners prevailed, where the  and  were arrayed. The foreigners prevailed there and broke through in pursuit inland, but on each wing the  and  prevailed.\nIn victory they let the routed foreigners flee, and brought the wings together to fight those who had broken through the center. The  prevailed, then followed the fleeing  and struck them down. When they reached the sea they demanded fire and laid hold of the  ships.\n\n\nIn this labor  the polemarch was slain, a brave man, and of the generals  son of  died.  son of  fell there, his hand cut off with an ax as he grabbed a ship's figurehead. Many other famous  also fell there.\n\n\nIn this way the  overpowered seven ships. The foreigners pushed off with the rest, picked up the  slaves from the island where they had left them, and sailed around  hoping to reach the city before the . There was an accusation at  that they devised this by a plan of the , who were said to have arranged to hold up a shield as a signal once the  were in their ships.\n\n\nThey sailed around , but the  marched back to defend the city as fast as their feet could carry them and got there ahead of the foreigners. Coming from the sacred precinct of  in Marathon, they pitched camp in the sacred precinct of  in . The foreigners lay at anchor off , the  naval port at that time. After riding anchor there, they sailed their ships back to .\n\n\nIn the battle at Marathon about six thousand four hundred men of the foreigners were killed, and one hundred and ninety-two ; that many fell on each side.\n\n The following marvel happened there: an ,  son of , was fighting as a brave man in the battle when he was deprived of his sight, though struck or hit nowhere on his body, and from that time on he spent the rest of his life in blindness.\nI have heard that he tells this story about his misfortune: he saw opposing him a tall armed man, whose beard overshadowed his shield, but the phantom passed him by and killed the man next to him. I learned by inquiry that this is the story  tells.\n\n\n journeyed with his army to , and when he arrived at  he saw a vision in his sleep. What that vision was is not told, but as soon as day broke  made a search of his ships. He found in a  ship a gilded image of , and asked where this plunder had been taken. Learning from what temple it had come, he sailed in his own ship to .\nThe  had now returned to their island, and  set the image in the temple, instructing the  to carry it away to , on the coast opposite .\n\n gave this order and sailed away, but the  never carried that statue away; twenty years later the  brought it to  by command of an oracle.\n\n\nWhen  and  reached  in their voyage, they carried the enslaved  inland to .\nBefore the  were taken captive, king  had been terribly angry with them for doing him unprovoked wrong; but when he saw them brought before him and subject to him, he did them no harm, but settled them in a domain of his own called  in the  land; this place is two hundred and ten stadia distant from , and forty from the well that is of three kinds.\nAsphalt and salt and oil are drawn from it in the following way: a windlass is used in the drawing, with half a skin tied to it in place of a bucket; this is dipped into the well and then poured into a tank; then what is drawn is poured into another tank and goes three ways: the asphalt and the salt congeal immediately; the oil, which the  call rhadinace, is dark and evil-smelling.\nThere king  settled the , and they dwelt in that place until my time, keeping their ancient language. Such was the fate of the .\n\n\nAfter the full moon two thousand  came to , making such great haste to reach it that they were in  on the third day after leaving . Although they came too late for the battle, they desired to see the , so they went to Marathon and saw them. Then they departed again, praising the  and their achievement.\n\n\nIt is a wonder to me, and I do not believe the story, that the  would ever have agreed to hold up a shield as a sign for the  out of a desire to make  subject to foreigners and to ; for it is plain to see that they were tyrant-haters as much as  (son of  and father of ), or even more so.\n\n was the only  who dared to buy ' possessions when they were put up for sale by the state after ' banishment from ; and he devised other acts of bitter hatred against him.\n\n\n This  is worthy of all men's remembrance for many reasons: first, because he so excellently freed his country, as I have said; second, for what he did at , where he won a horserace, and was second in a four-horse chariot, after already winning a  prize, and was the cynosure of all  for the lavishness of his spending;\n\nand third, for his behavior regarding his three daughters. When they were of marriageable age, he gave them a most splendid gift and one very pleasant to them, promising that each would wed that man whom she chose for herself from all the .\n\n\nThe  were tyrant-haters as much as , or not less so. Therefore I find it a strange and unbelievable accusation that they of all men should have held up a shield; at all times they shunned tyrants, and it was by their contrivance that the sons of  were deposed from their tyranny.\nThus in my judgment it was they who freed  much more than did  and . These only enraged the remaining sons of  by killing , and did nothing to end the tyranny of the rest of them; but the  plainly liberated their country, if they truly were the ones who persuaded the  priestess to signify to the  that they should free , as I have previously shown.\n\n\nPerhaps out of some grudge against the  people they betrayed their country. But there were no others at  more esteemed or more honored than they;\n\ntherefore plain reason forbids believing that they of all men could have held up the shield for any such cause. A shield was held up; this cannot be denied, for it happened; but who did it I do not know, and I can say no further.\n\n\nThe  had been men of renown at  even in the old days, and from the time of  and then  their renown increased.\nWhen the  from  came from  to the  oracle,  son of  worked with them and zealously aided them; when  heard from the  who visited the oracle of 's benefits to him, he summoned  to , and there made him a gift of as much gold as he could carry away at one time on his person.\nConsidering the nature of the gift,  planned and employed this device: he donned a wide tunic, leaving a deep fold in it, and put on the most spacious boots that he could find, then went into the treasury to which they led him.\nFalling upon a heap of gold-dust, first he packed next to his legs as much gold as his boots would contain; then he filled all the fold of his tunic with gold and strewed the dust among the hair of his head, and took more of it into his mouth; when he came out of the treasury, hardly dragging the weight of his boots, he was like anything rather than a human being, with his mouth crammed full and all his body swollen.\n\n burst out laughing at the sight and gave him all the gold he already had and that much more again. Thus the family grew very rich;  came to keep four-horse chariots and won with them at .\n\n\nIn the next generation  the tyrant of  raised that house still higher, so that it grew much more famous in  than it had formerly been.  son of  son of  son of  had one daughter, whose name was . He desired to wed her to the best man he could find in .\nIt was the time of the  games, and when he was victor there with a four-horse chariot,  made a proclamation that whichever  thought himself worthy to be his son-in-law should come on the sixtieth day from then or earlier to , and  would make good his promise of marriage in a year from that sixtieth day.\nThen all the  who were proud of themselves and their country came as suitors, and to that end  had them compete in running and wrestling contests.\n\n\nFrom  came  of , son of , the most luxurious liver of his day (and  was then at the height of its prosperity), and  of , son of that  who was called the Wise.\nThese came from ; from the ,  son of , an ; he was from the . From  came Males, the brother of that  who surpassed all the  in strength, and fled from the sight of men to the farthest parts of the  land.\nFrom the  came , son of  the tyrant of , that  who made weights and measures for the  and acted more arrogantly than any other ; he drove out the  contest-directors and held the contests at  himself. This man's son now came, and , an  from , son of ; and an  from the town of , , son of that  who, as the  tale relates, gave lodging to the , and ever since kept open house for all men; and  from , son of .\nThese came from the  itself; from , son of that  who visited , and also  son of , who surpassed the  in wealth and looks. From , which at that time was prosperous, came ; he was the only man from . From  came a ,  of ; and from the , .\n\n\nThese were the suitors. When they arrived on the appointed day,  first inquired the country and lineage of each; then he kept them with him for a year, testing their manliness and temper and upbringing and manner of life; this he did by consorting with them alone and in company, putting the younger of them to contests of strength, but especially watching their demeanor at the common meal; for as long as he kept them with him, he did everything for them and entertained them with magnificence.\nThe suitors that most pleased him were the ones who had come from , and of these  son of  was judged foremost, both for his manliness and because in ancestry he was related to the  of .\n\n\nWhen the appointed day came for the marriage feast and for ' declaration of whom he had chosen out of them all,  sacrificed a hundred oxen and gave a feast to the suitors and to the whole of .\nAfter dinner the suitors vied with each other in music and in anecdotes for all to hear. As they sat late drinking, , now far outdoing the rest, ordered the flute-player to play him a dance-tune; the flute-player obeyed and he began to dance. I suppose he pleased himself with his dancing, but  saw the whole business with much disfavor.\n\n then stopped for a while and ordered a table to be brought in; when the table arrived, he danced  figures on it first, and then Attic; last of all he rested his head on the table and made gestures with his legs in the air.\nNow  at the first and the second bout of dancing could no more bear to think of  as his son-in-law, because of his dancing and his shamelessness, but he had held himself in check, not wanting to explode at ; but when he saw him making gestures with his legs, he could no longer keep silence and said, son of , you have danced away your marriage.  said in answer, It does not matter to ! Since then this is proverbial.\n\n\nThen  bade them all be silent and spoke to the company at large: Suitors for my daughter's hand, I thank you one and all; if it were possible I would grant each of you his wish, neither choosing out one to set him above another nor disparaging the rest.\nBut since I have but one maiden to plan for and so cannot please all of you, to those of you whose suit is rejected I make a gift of a talent of silver to each, for his desire to take a wife from my house and for his sojourn away from his home; and to  son of  do I betroth my daughter , by the laws of the .  accepted the betrothal, and  brought the marriage to pass.\n\n\nSuch is the tale of the choice among the suitors; and thus the fame of the  resounded throughout . From this marriage was born that , named after his mother's father from , who gave the  their tribes and their democracy;\n\nhe and  were born to ;  was father of another  and another , called after  who was ' daughter. She was married to  son of , and when she was pregnant she saw in her sleep a vision in which she thought she gave birth to a lion. In a few days she bore  a son, .\n\n\nAfter the  disaster at Marathon, the reputation of , already great at , very much increased. He asked the  for seventy ships, an army, and money, not revealing against what country he would lead them, but saying that he would make them rich if they followed him; he would bring them to a country from which they could easily carry away an abundance of gold; so he said when he asked for the ships. The  were induced by these promises and granted his request.\n\n\n took his army and sailed for , on the pretext that the  had brought this on themselves by first sending triremes with the  fleet to Marathon. Such was the pretext of his argument, but he had a grudge against the  because  son of , a man of  descent, had slandered him to  the .\nWhen he reached his voyage's destination,  with his army drove the  inside their walls and besieged them; he sent in a herald and demanded a hundred talents, saying that if they did not give it to him, his army would not return home before it had stormed their city.\nThe  had no intention of giving  any money at all, and they contrived how to defend their city. They did this by building their wall at night to double its former height where it was most assailable, and also by other devices.\n\n\nAll the  tell the same story up to this point; after this the  themselves say that the following happened: as  was in a quandary, a captive woman named ,  by birth and an under-priestess of the goddesses of the dead, came to talk with him.\nComing before , she advised him, if taking  was very important to him, to do whatever she suggested. Then, following her advice, he passed through to the hill in front of the city and jumped over the fence of the precinct of  the Lawgiver, since he was unable to open the door. After leaping over, he went to the shrine, whether to move something that should not be moved, or with some other intention. When he was right at the doors, he was immediately seized with panic and hurried back by the same route; leaping down from the wall he twisted his thigh, but some say he hit his knee.\n\n\nSo  sailed back home in a sorry condition, neither bringing money for the  nor having won ; he had besieged the town for twenty-six days and ravaged the island.\nThe  learned that  the under-priestess of the goddesses had been ' guide and desired to punish her for this. Since they now had respite from the siege, they sent messengers to  to ask if they should put the under-priestess to death for guiding their enemies to the capture of her native country, and for revealing to  the rites that no male should know.\nBut the  priestess forbade them, saying that  was not responsible:  was doomed to make a bad end, and an apparition had led him in these evils.\n\n\nSuch was the priestess' reply to the . The  had much to say about  on his return from , especially  son of , who prosecuted  before the people for deceiving the  and called for the death penalty.\n\n was present but could not speak in his own defense, since his thigh was festering; he was laid before the court on a couch, and his friends spoke for him, often mentioning the fight at Marathon and the conquest of : how  had punished the  and taken , delivering it to the .\nThe people took his side as far as not condemning him to death, but they fined him fifty talents for his wrongdoing.  later died of gangrene and rot in his thigh, and the fifty talents were paid by his son .\n\n\n son of  took possession of  in this way: When the  were driven out of  by the , whether justly or unjustly I cannot say, beyond what is told; namely, that  the son of  declares in his history that the act was unjust;\n\nfor when the  saw the land under , formerly theirs, which they had given to the  as a dwelling-place in reward for the wall that had once been built around the acropoliswhen the  saw how well this place was tilled which previously had been bad and worthless, they were envious and coveted the land, and so drove the  out on this and no other pretext. But the  themselves say that their reason for expelling the  was just.\nThe  set out from their settlement at the foot of  and wronged the  in this way: Neither the  nor any other  had servants yet at that time, and their sons and daughters used to go to the  for water; and whenever they came, the  maltreated them out of mere arrogance and pride. And this was not enough for them; finally they were caught in the act of planning to attack .\nThe  were much better men than the , since when they could have killed them, caught plotting as they were, they would not so do, but ordered them out of the country. The  departed and took possession of , besides other places. This is the  story; the other is told by .\n\n\nThese  dwelt at that time in  and desired vengeance on the . Since they well knew the time of the  festivals, they acquired fifty-oared ships and set an ambush for the  women celebrating the festival of  at . They seized many of the women, then sailed away with them and brought them to  to be their concubines.\nThese women bore more and more children, and they taught their sons the speech of  and  manners. These boys would not mix with the sons of the  women; if one of them was beaten by one of the others, they would all run to his aid and help each other; these boys even claimed to rule the others, and were much stronger.\nWhen the  perceived this, they took counsel together; it troubled them much in their deliberations to think what the boys would do when they grew to manhood, if they were resolved to help each other against the sons of the lawful wives and attempted to rule them already.\nThereupon the  resolved to kill the sons of the Attic women; they did this, and then killed the boys' mothers also. From this deed and the earlier one which was done by the women when they killed their own husbands who were ' companions, a  crime has been a proverb in  for any deed of cruelty.\n\n\nBut when the  had murdered their own sons and women, their land brought forth no fruit, nor did their wives and their flocks and herds bear offspring as before. Crushed by hunger and childlessness, they sent to  to ask for some release from their present ills.\nThe  priestess ordered them to pay the  whatever penalty the  themselves judged. The  went to  and offered to pay the penalty for all their wrongdoing.\nThe  set in their town-hall a couch adorned as finely as possible, and placed beside it a table covered with all manner of good things, then ordered the  to deliver their land to them in the same condition.\nThe  answered, We will deliver it when a ship with a north wind accomplishes the voyage from your country to ours in one day; they supposed that this was impossible, since  is far to the south of .\n\n\nAt the time that was all. But a great many years later, when the  on the  was made subject to ,  son of  accomplished the voyage from  on the  to  with the  winds then constantly blowing; he proclaimed that the  must leave their island, reminding them of the oracle which the  thought would never be fulfilled.\nThe  obeyed, but the  would not agree that the  was  and were besieged, until they too submitted.

Finally he worked on  and persuaded him to do this, and other things happened that helped him to persuade .\nMessengers came from  from the  (who were princes of ) and invited the king into  with all earnestness; the  who had come up to  used the same pleas as the , offering  even more than they did.\nThey had come up to  with , an  diviner who had set in order the oracles of . They had reconciled their previous hostility with him;  had been banished from  by ' son , when he was caught by  of  in the act of interpolating into the writings of  an oracle showing that the islands off  would disappear into the sea.\nBecause of this  banished him, though they had previously been close friends. Now he had arrived at  with the , and whenever he came into the king's presence they used lofty words concerning him and he recited from his oracles; all that portended disaster to the  he left unspoken, choosing and reciting such prophecies as were most favorable, telling how the  must be bridged by a man of  and describing the expedition.\nSo he brought his oracles to bear, while the  and  gave their opinions.\n\n\nAfter being persuaded to send an expedition against ,  first marched against the rebels in the year after  death. He subdued them and laid  under a much harder slavery than in the time of , and he handed it over to , his own brother and ' son. While governing , this  was at a later time slain by a ,  son of .\n\n\nAfter the conquest of , intending now to take in hand the expedition against ,  held a special assembly of the noblest among the , so he could learn their opinions and declare his will before them all. When they were assembled,  spoke to them as follows:\n\n\nMen of , I am not bringing in and establishing a new custom, but following one that I have inherited. As I learn from our elders, we have never yet remained at peace ever since  deposed  and we won this sovereignty from the . It is the will of heaven; and we ourselves win advantage by our many enterprises. No one needs to tell you, who already know them well, which nations  and  and  my father subdued and added to our realm.\nEver since I came to this throne, I have considered how I might not fall short of my predecessors in this honor, and not add less power to the ; and my considerations persuade me that we may win not only renown, but a land neither less nor worse, and more fertile, than that which we now possess; and we would also gain vengeance and requital. For this cause I have now summoned you together, that I may impart to you what I intend to do.\n\nIt is my intent to bridge the  and lead my army through  to , so I may punish the  for what they have done to the  and to my father.\nYou saw that  my father was set on making an expedition against these men. But he is dead, and it was not granted him to punish them. On his behalf and that of all the , I will never rest until I have taken  and burnt it, for the unprovoked wrong that its people did to my father and me.\nFirst they came to  with our slave  the  and burnt the groves and the temples; next, how they dealt with us when we landed on their shores, when  and  were our generals, I suppose you all know.\n\nFor these reasons I am resolved to send an army against them; and I reckon that we will find the following benefits among them: if we subdue those men, and their neighbors who dwell in the land of  the , we will make the borders of  territory and of the firmament of heaven be the same.\nNo land that the sun beholds will border ours, but I will make all into one country, when I have passed over the whole of .\nI learn that this is the situation: no city of men or any human nation which is able to meet us in battle will be left, if those of whom I speak are taken out of our way. Thus the guilty and the innocent will alike bear the yoke of slavery.\n\nThis is how you would best please me: when I declare the time for your coming, every one of you must eagerly appear; and whoever comes with his army best equipped will receive from me such gifts as are reckoned most precious among us.\nThus it must be done; but so that I not seem to you to have my own way, I lay the matter before you all, and bid whoever wishes to declare his opinion. So spoke  and ceased.\n\n\nAfter him  said: Master, you surpass not only all  that have been but also all that shall be; besides having dealt excellently and truly with all other matters, you will not suffer the  who dwell in  to laugh at us, which they have no right to do.\nIt would be strange indeed if we who have subdued and made slaves of  and  and  and  and many other great nations, for no wrong done to the  but of mere desire to add to our power, will not take vengeance on the  for unprovoked wrongs.\n\nWhat have we to fear from them? Have they a massive population or abundance of wealth? Their manner of fighting we know, and we know how weak their power is; we have conquered and hold their sons, those who dwell in our land and are called  and  and .\nI myself have made trial of these men, when by your father's command I marched against them. I marched as far as  and almost to  itself, yet none came out to meet me in battle.\n\nYet the  are accustomed to wage wars, as I learn, and they do it most senselessly in their wrongheadedness and folly. When they have declared war against each other, they come down to the fairest and most level ground that they can find and fight there, so that the victors come off with great harm; of the vanquished I say not so much as a word, for they are utterly destroyed.\nSince they speak the same language, they should end their disputes by means of heralds or messengers, or by any way rather than fighting; if they must make war upon each other, they should each discover where they are in the strongest position and make the attempt there. The  custom, then, is not good; and when I marched as far as the land of , it had not come into their minds to fight.\n\nBut against you, O king, who shall make war? You will bring the multitudes of , and all your ships. I think there is not so much boldness in  as that; but if time should show me wrong in my judgment, and those men prove foolhardy enough to do battle with us, they would be taught that we are the greatest warriors on earth. Let us leave nothing untried; for nothing happens by itself, and all men's gains are the fruit of adventure.\n\n\nThus  smoothed ' resolution and stopped. The rest of the  held their peace, not daring to utter any opinion contrary to what had been put forward; then  son of , the king's uncle, spoke. Relying on his position, he said,\n\n\nO king, if opposite opinions are not uttered, it is impossible for someone to choose the better; the one which has been spoken must be followed. If they are spoken, the better can be found; just as the purity of gold cannot be determined by itself, but when gold is compared with gold by rubbing, we then determine the better.\nNow I advised , your father and my brother, not to lead his army against the , who have no cities anywhere to dwell in. But he hoped to subdue the nomadic  and would not obey me; he went on the expedition and returned after losing many gallant men from his army.\nYou, O king, are proposing to lead your armies against far better men than the men who are said to be excellent warriors by sea and land. It is right that I should show you what danger there is in this.\n\nYou say that you will bridge the  and march your army through  to . Now suppose you happen to be defeated either by land or by sea, or even both; the men are said to be valiant, and we may well guess that it is so, since the  alone destroyed the great army that followed  and  to .\nSuppose they do not succeed in both ways; but if they attack with their ships and prevail in a sea-fight, and then sail to the  and destroy your bridge, that, O king, is the hour of peril.\n\nIt is from no wisdom of my own that I thus conjecture; it is because I know what disaster once almost overtook us, when your father, making a highway over the  and bridging the river , crossed over to attack the . At that time the  used every means of entreating the , who had been charged to guard the bridges of the , to destroy the way of passage.\nIf  the tyrant of  had consented to the opinion of the other tyrants instead of opposing it, the power of  would have perished. Yet it is dreadful even in the telling, that one man should hold in his hand all the king's fortunes.\n\nSo do not plan to run the risk of any such danger when there is no need for it. Listen to me instead: for now dismiss this assembly; consider the matter by yourself and, whenever you so please, declare what seems best to you.\nA well-laid plan is always to my mind most profitable; even if it is thwarted later, the plan was no less good, and it is only chance that has baffled the design; but if fortune favor one who has planned poorly, then he has gotten only a prize of chance, and his plan was no less bad.\n\nYou see how the god smites with his thunderbolt creatures of greatness and does not suffer them to display their pride, while little ones do not move him to anger; and you see how it is always on the tallest buildings and trees that his bolts fall; for the god loves to bring low all things of surpassing greatness. Thus a large army is destroyed by a smaller, when the jealous god sends panic or the thunderbolt among them, and they perish unworthily; for the god suffers pride in none but himself.\n\nNow haste is always the parent of failure, and great damages are likely to arise; but in waiting there is good, and in time this becomes clear, even though it does not seem so in the present.\n\nThis, O king, is my advice to you. But you,  son of , cease your foolish words about the , for they do not deserve to be maligned. By slandering the  you incite the king to send this expedition; that is the end to which you press with all eagerness. Let it not be so.\nSlander is a terrible business; there are two in it who do wrong and one who suffers wrong. The slanderer wrongs another by accusing an absent man, and the other does wrong in that he is persuaded before he has learned the whole truth; the absent man does not hear what is said of him and suffers wrong in the matter, being maligned by the one and condemned by the other.\n\nIf an army must by all means be sent against these , hear me now: let the king himself remain in the  land, and let us two stake our children's lives upon it; you lead out the army, choosing whatever men you wish and taking as great an army as you desire.\nIf the king's fortunes fare as you say, let my sons be slain, and myself with them; but if it turns out as I foretell, let your sons be so treated, and you likewise, if you return.\nBut if you are unwilling to submit to this and will at all hazards lead your army overseas to , then I think that those left behind in this place will hear that  has done great harm to , and has been torn apart by dogs and birds in the land of  or of , if not even before that on the way there; and that you have learned what kind of men you persuade the king to attack.\n\n\nThus spoke .  answered angrily, , you are my father's brother; that will save you from receiving the fitting reward of foolish words. But for your cowardly lack of spirit I lay upon you this disgrace, that you will not go with me and my army against , but will stay here with the women; I myself will accomplish all that I have said, with no help from you.\nMay I not be the son of  son of  son of  son of  son of  son of  son of  son of  son of , if I do not have vengeance on the ; I well know that if we remain at peace they will not; they will assuredly invade our country, if we may infer from what they have done already, for they burnt  and marched into .\nIt is not possible for either of us to turn back: to do or to suffer is our task, so that what is ours be under the , or what is theirs under the ; there is no middle way in our quarrel.\nHonor then demands that we avenge ourselves for what has been done to us; thus will I learn what is this evil that will befall me when I march against these men that even  the , the slave of my forefathers, did so utterly subdue that to this day they and their country are called by the name of their conqueror.\n\n\nThe discussion went that far; then night came, and  was pricked by the advice of . Thinking it over at night, he saw clearly that to send an army against  was not his affair. He made this second resolve and fell asleep; then (so the  say) in the night he saw this vision: It seemed to  that a tall and handsome man stood over him and said,\n\n Are you then changing your mind, , and will not lead the expedition against , although you have proclaimed the mustering of the army? It is not good for you to change your mind, and there will be no one here to pardon you for it; let your course be along the path you resolved upon yesterday.\n\n\nSo the vision spoke, and seemed to  to vanish away. When day dawned, the king took no account of this dream, and he assembled the  whom he had before gathered together and addressed them thus:\n\n, forgive me for turning and twisting in my purpose; I am not yet come to the fullness of my wisdom, and I am never free from people who exhort me to do as I said. It is true that when I heard ' opinion my youthful spirit immediately boiled up, and I burst out with an unseemly and wrongful answer to one older than myself; but now I see my fault and will follow his judgment.\nBe at peace, since I have changed my mind about marching against .\n\n\nWhen the  heard that, they rejoiced and made obeisance to him. But when night came on, the same vision stood again over  as he slept, and said, Son of , have you then plainly renounced your army's march among the , and made my words of no account, as though you had not heard them? Know for certain that, if you do not lead out your army immediately, this will be the outcome of it: as you became great and mighty in a short time, so in a moment will you be brought low again.\n\n\nGreatly frightened by the vision,  leapt up from his bed, and sent a messenger to summon . When he came,  said, , for a moment I was of unsound mind, and I answered your good advice with foolish words; but after no long time I repented, and saw that it was right for me to follow your advice.\nYet, though I desire to, I cannot do it; ever since I turned back and repented, a vision keeps coming to haunt my sight, and it will not allow me to do as you advise; just now it has threatened me and gone.\nNow if a god is sending the vision, and it is his full pleasure that there this expedition against  take place, that same dream will hover about you and give you the same command it gives me. I believe that this is most likely to happen, if you take all my apparel and sit wearing it upon my throne, and then lie down to sleep in my bed.\n\n\n said this, but  would not obey the first command, thinking it was not right for him to sit on the royal throne; at last he was compelled and did as he was bid, saying first:\n\n\nO king, I judge it of equal worth whether a man is wise or is willing to obey good advice; to both of these you have attained, but the company of bad men trips you up; just as they say that sea, of all things the most serviceable to men, is hindered from following its nature by the blasts of winds that fall upon it.\nIt was not that I heard harsh words from you that stung me so much as that, when two opinions were laid before the , one tending to the increase of pride, the other to its abatement, showing how evil a thing it is to teach the heart continual desire of more than it has, of these two opinions you preferred that one which was more fraught with danger to yourself and to the .\n\nNow when you have turned to the better opinion, you say that, while intending to abandon the expedition against the , you are haunted by a dream sent by some god, which forbids you to disband the expedition.\nBut this is none of heaven's working, my son. The roving dreams that visit men are of such nature as I shall teach you, since I am many years older than you. Those visions that rove about us in dreams are for the most part the thoughts of the day; and in these recent days we have been very busy with this expedition.\n\nBut if this is not as I determine and it has something divine to it, then you have spoken the conclusion of the matter; let it appear to me just as it has to you, and utter its command. If it really wishes to appear, it should do so to me no more by virtue of my wearing your dress instead of mine, and my sleeping in your bed rather than in my own.\nWhatever it is that appears to you in your sleep, surely it has not come to such folly as to infer from your dress that I am you when it sees me. We now must learn if it will take no account of me and not deign to appear and haunt me, whether I am wearing your robes or my own, but will come to you; if it comes continually, I myself would say that it is something divine.\nIf you are determined that this must be done and there is no averting it, and I must lie down to sleep in your bed, so be it; this duty I will fulfill, and let the vision appear also to me. But until then I will keep my present opinion.\n\n\nSo spoke  and did as he was bid, hoping to prove ' words vain; he put on ' robes and sat on the king's throne. Then while he slept there came to him in his sleep the same dream that had haunted ; it stood over him and spoke thus:\n\nAre you the one who dissuades  from marching against , because you care for him? Neither in the future nor now will you escape with impunity for striving to turn aside what must be. To  himself it has been declared what will befall him if he disobeys.\n\n\nWith this threat (so it seemed to ) the vision was about to burn his eyes with hot irons. He leapt up with a loud cry, then sat by  and told him the whole story of what he had seen in his dream, and next he said:\n\nO King, since I have seen, as much as a man may, how the greater has often been brought low by the lesser, I forbade you to always give rein to your youthful spirit, knowing how evil a thing it is to have many desires, and remembering the end of ' expedition against the  and of ' against the , and I myself marched with  against the .\nKnowing this, I judged that you had only to remain in peace for all men to deem you fortunate. But since there is some divine motivation, and it seems that the gods mark  for destruction, I myself change and correct my judgment. Now declare the gods' message to the , and bid them obey your first command for all due preparation. Do this, so that nothing on your part be lacking to the fulfillment of the gods' commission.\nAfter this was said, they were incited by the vision, and when daylight came  imparted all this to the .  now openly encouraged that course which he alone had before openly discouraged.\n\n\n was now intent on the expedition and then saw a third vision in his sleep, which the  interpreted to refer to the whole earth and to signify that all men should be his slaves. This was the vision:  thought that he was crowned with an olive bough, of which the shoots spread over the whole earth, and then the crown vanished from off his head where it was set.\nThe  interpreted it in this way, and immediately every single man of the  who had been assembled rode away to his own province and there used all zeal to fulfill the kings command, each desiring to receive the promised gifts. Thus it was that  mustered his army, searching out every part of the continent.\n\n\nFor full four years after the conquest of  he was equipping his force and preparing all that was needed for it; before the fifth year was completed, he set forth on his march with the might of a great multitude.\nThis was by far the greatest of all expeditions that we know of. The one that  led against the  is nothing compared to it; neither is the  expedition when they burst into Media in pursuit of the  and subdued and ruled almost all the upper lands of  (it was for this that  afterwards attempted to punish them). According to the reports, the expedition led by the sons of  against  is also nothing by comparison; neither is the one of the  and  which before the  war crossed the  into , subdued all the , and came down to the , marching southward as far as the river .\n\n\nAll these expeditions and whatever others have happened in addition could not together be compared with this single one. For what nation did  not lead from  against ? What water did not fail when being drunk up, except only the greatest rivers?\nSome people supplied him with ships, some were enrolled in his infantry, some were assigned the provision of horsemen, others of horse-bearing transports to follow the army, and others again of warships for the bridges, or of food and ships.\n\n\nSince those who had earlier attempted to sail around  had suffered shipwreck, for about three years preparations had been underway there. Triremes were anchored off  in the ; with these for their headquarters, all sorts of men in the army were compelled by whippings to dig a canal, coming by turns to the work; the inhabitants about  also dug.\n\n son of  and  son of , both , were the overseers of the workmen.  is a great and famous mountain, running out into the sea and inhabited by men. At the mountain's landward end it is in the form of a peninsula, and there is an isthmus about twelve stadia wide; here is a place of level ground or little hills, from the sea by  to the sea opposite .\nOn this isthmus which is at the end of , there stands a  town, Sane; there are others situated seaward of Sane and landward of , and the  now intended to make them into island and not mainland towns; they are , , , , and .\n\n\nThese are the towns situated on . The foreigners dug as follows, dividing up the ground by nation: they made a straight line near the town of Sane; when the channel had been dug to some depth, some men stood at the bottom of it and dug, others took the dirt as it was dug out and delivered it to yet others that stood higher on stages, and they again to others as they received it, until they came to those that were highest; these carried it out and threw it away.\nFor all except the , the steep sides of the canal caved in, doubling their labor; since they made the span the same breadth at its mouth and at the bottom, this was bound to happen.\nBut the  showed the same skill in this as in all else they do; taking in hand the portion that fell to them, they dug by making the topmost span of the canal as wide again as the canal was to be, and narrowed it as they worked lower, until at the bottom their work was of the same span as that of the others.\nThere is a meadow there, where they made a place for buying and marketing; much ground grain frequently came to them from .\n\n\nAs far as I can judge by conjecture,  gave the command for this digging out of pride, wishing to display his power and leave a memorial; with no trouble they could have drawn their ships across the isthmus, yet he ordered them to dig a canal from sea to sea, wide enough to float two triremes rowed abreast. The same men who were assigned the digging were also assigned to join the banks of the river  by a bridge.\n\n\nThus  did this. He assigned the  and  to make ropes of papyrus and white flax for the bridges, and to store provisions for his army, so that neither the army nor the beasts of burden would starve on the march to .\nAfter making inquiry, he ordered them to store it in the most fitting places, carrying it to the various places from all parts of  in cargo ships and transports. They brought most of it to the  (as it is called) in ; some were dispatched to  in the  country or to , others to  on the  or to .\n\n\nWhile these worked at their appointed task, all the land force had been mustered and was marching with  to , setting forth from  in , which was the place appointed for gathering all the army that was to march with  himself by land.\nNow which of his governors received the promised gifts from the king for bringing the best-equipped army, I cannot say; I do not even know if the matter was ever determined.\nWhen they had crossed the river  and entered , they marched through that country to , where rises the source of the river  and of another river no smaller, which is called Cataractes; it rises right in the market-place of  and issues into the . The skin of  the  also hangs there; the  story tells that it was flayed off him and hung up by .\n\n\nIn this city  son of , a , sat awaiting them; he entertained  himself and all the king's army with the greatest hospitality, and declared himself willing to provide money for the war.\nWhen  offered the money,  asked the  present who this  was and how much wealth he possessed in making the offer. They said, O king, this is the one who gave your father  the gift of a golden plane-tree and vine; he is now the richest man we know of after you.\n\n\n marvelled at this last saying and next himself asked  how much wealth he had. O king, said , I will not conceal the quantity of my property from you, nor pretend that I do not know; I know and will tell you the exact truth.\nAs soon as I learned that you were coming down to the , I wanted to give you money for the war, so I inquired into the matter, and my reckoning showed me that I had two thousand talents of silver, and four million Daric staters of gold, lacking seven thousand.\nAll this I freely give to you; for myself, I have a sufficient livelihood from my slaves and my farms.\n\n\nThus he spoke.  was pleased with what he said and replied: My  friend, since I came out of  I have so far met with no man who was willing to give hospitality to my army, nor who came into my presence unsummoned and offered to furnish money for the war, besides you.\nBut you have entertained my army nobly and offer me great sums. In return for this I give you these privileges: I make you my friend, and out of my own wealth I give you the seven thousand staters which will complete your total of four million, so that your four million not lack the seven thousand and the even number be reached by my completing it.\nRemain in possession of what you now possess, and be mindful to be always such as you are; neither for the present nor in time will you regret what you now do.\n\n\n said this and made good his words, then journeyed ever onward. Passing by the  town called , and the lake from which salt is obtained, he came to , a great city in ; there the river  plunges into a cleft in the earth and disappears, until it reappears about five stadia away; this river issues into the .\nFrom  the army held its course for the borders of  and , and came to the city of , where there stands a pillar set up by  which marks the boundary with an inscription.\n\n\nPassing from  into , he came to the place where the roads part; the road on the left leads to , the one on the right to ; on the latter the traveller must cross the river  and pass by the city of , where craftsmen make honey out of wheat and tamarisks.  went by this road and found a plane-tree, which he adorned with gold because of its beauty, and he assigned one of his immortals to guard it. On the next day he reached the city of the .\n\n\nAfter he arrived in , he first sent heralds to  to demand earth and water and to command the preparation of meals for the king. He sent demands for earth everywhere except to  and . The reason for his sending for earth and water the second time was this: he fully believed that whoever had not previously given it to ' messengers would now be compelled to give by fear; so he sent out of desire to know this for certain.\n\n\nAfter this he prepared to march to ; meanwhile his men were bridging the  from  to . On the , which is on the , between the city of  and  there is a broad headland running out into the sea opposite . It was here that not long afterwards the , when  son of  was their general, took , a  and the governor of , and crucified him alive; he had been in the habit of bringing women right into the temple of  at  and doing impious deeds there.\n\n\nThe men who had been given this assignment made bridges starting from  across to that headland; the  one of flaxen cables, and the  a papyrus one. From  to the opposite shore it is a distance of seven stadia.  But no sooner had the strait been bridged than a great storm swept down, breaking and scattering everything.\n\n\nWhen  heard of this, he was very angry and commanded that the  be whipped with three hundred lashes, and a pair of fetters be thrown into the sea. I have even heard that he sent branders with them to brand the .\nHe commanded them while they whipped to utter words outlandish and presumptuous, Bitter water, our master thus punishes you, because you did him wrong though he had done you none.  the king will pass over you, whether you want it or not; in accordance with justice no one offers you sacrifice, for you are a turbid and briny river.\nHe commanded that the sea receive these punishments and that the overseers of the bridge over the  be beheaded.\n\n\nSo this was done by those who were appointed to the thankless honor, and new engineers set about making the bridges. They made the bridges as follows: in order to lighten the strain of the cables, they placed fifty-oared ships and triremes alongside each other, three hundred and sixty to bear the bridge nearest the , and three hundred and fourteen to bear the other; all lay obliquely to the line of the  and parallel with the current of the .\nAfter putting the ships together they let down very great anchors, both from the end of the ships on the  side to hold fast against the winds blowing from within that sea, and from the other end, towards the west and the , to hold against the west and south winds. They left a narrow opening to sail through in the line of fifty-oared ships and triremes, that so whoever wanted to could sail by small craft to the  or out of it.\nAfter doing this, they stretched the cables from the land, twisting them taut with wooden windlasses; they did not as before keep the two kinds apart, but assigned for each bridge two cables of flax and four of papyrus.\nAll these had the same thickness and fine appearance, but the flaxen were heavier in proportion, for a cubit of them weighed a talent.\nWhen the strait was thus bridged, they sawed logs of wood to a length equal to the breadth of the floating supports, and laid them in order on the taut cables; after placing them together they then made them fast. After doing this, they carried brushwood onto the bridge; when this was all laid in order they heaped earth on it and stamped it down; then they made a fence on either side, so that the beasts of burden and horses not be frightened by the sight of the sea below them.\n\n\nWhen the bridges and the work at  were ready, and both the dikes at the canal's entrances, built to prevent the surf from silting up the entrances of the dug passage, and the canal itself were reported to be now completely finished, the army then wintered. At the beginning of spring the army made ready and set forth from  to march to .\nAs it was setting out, the sun left his place in the heaven and was invisible, although the sky was without clouds and very clear, and the day turned into night. When  saw and took note of that, he was concerned and asked the  what the vision might signify.\nThey declared to him that the god was showing the  the abandonment of their cities; for the sun (they said) was the prophet of the , as the moon was their own.  rejoiced exceedingly to hear that and continued on his march.\n\n\nAs  led his army away,  the , frightened by the heavenly vision and encouraged by the gifts that he had received, came to  and said, Master, I have a favor to ask that I desire of you, easy for you to grant and precious for me to receive.\n\n supposed that  would demand anything rather than what he did ask and answered that he would grant the request, bidding him declare what he desired. When  heard this, he took courage and said: Master, I have five sons, and all of them are constrained to march with you against .\nI pray you, O king, take pity on me in my advanced age, and release one of my sons, the eldest, from service, so that he may take care of me and of my possessions; take the four others with you, and may you return back with all your plans accomplished.\n\n\n became very angry and thus replied: Villain, you see me marching against  myself, and taking with me my sons and brothers and relations and friends; do you, my slave, who should have followed me with all your household and your very wife, speak to me of your son? Be well assured of this, that a man's spirit dwells in his ears; when it hears good words it fills the whole body with delight, but when it hears the opposite it swells with anger.\nWhen you did me good service and promised more, you will never boast that you outdid your king in the matter of benefits; and now that you have turned aside to the way of shamelessness, you will receive a lesser requital than you merit. You and four of your sons are saved by your hospitality; but you shall be punished by the life of that one you most desire to keep.\nWith that reply, he immediately ordered those who were assigned to do these things to find the eldest of  sons and cut him in half, then to set one half of his body on the right side of the road and the other on the left, so that the army would pass between them.\n\n\nThis they did, and the army passed between. First went the baggage train and the beasts of burden, and after them a mixed army of all sorts of nations, not according to their divisions but all mingled together; when more than half had passed there was a space left, and these did not come near the king.\n\n After that, first came a thousand horsemen, chosen out of all ; next, a thousand spearmen, picked men like the others, carrying their spears reversed; and after them ten horses of the breed called , equipped most splendidly.\nThe horses are called  because there is in Media a wide plain of that name, where the great horses are bred.\nBehind these ten horses was the place of the sacred chariot of , drawn by eight white horses, with the charioteer following the horses on foot and holding the reins; for no mortal man may mount into that seat. After these came  himself in a chariot drawn by  horses; beside him was his charioteer, whose name was , the son of , a .\n\n\nIn this way  rode out from ; but whenever the thought took him he would alight from the chariot into a carriage. Behind him came a thousand spearmen of the best and noblest blood of , carrying their spears in the customary manner; after them a thousand picked  horsemen, and after the horse ten thousand that were foot soldiers, chosen out of the rest of the .\nOne thousand of these had golden pomegranates on their spear-shafts instead of a spike, and surrounded the rest; the nine thousand who were inside them had silver pomegranates. Those who held their spears reversed also carried golden pomegranates, and those following nearest to  had apples of gold. After the ten thousand came ten thousand  horsemen in array. After these there was a space of two stadia, and then the rest of the multitude followed all mixed together.\n\n\nFrom  the army took its course to the river  and the land of ; leaving the , they went through  to the city of , keeping the mountain of  on the left. From there they journeyed over the plain of , passing the city of  and the  city of .\nThen they came into the territory of , with  on their left. When they had halted for the night at the foot of , a storm of thunder and lightning fell upon them, killing a great crowd of them there.\n\n\nWhen the army had come to the river , which was the first river after the beginning of their march from  that fell short of their needs and was not sufficient for the army and the cattle to drinkarriving at this river,  ascended to the citadel of , having a desire to see it.\nAfter he saw it and asked about everything there, he sacrificed a thousand cattle to  of , and the  offered libations to the heroes. After they did this, a panic fell upon the camp in the night. When it was day they journeyed on from there, keeping on their left the cities of  and  and , which borders , and on their right the .\n\n\nWhen they were at ,  wanted to see the whole of his army. A lofty seat of white stone had been set up for him on a hill there for this very purpose, built by the people of  at the king's command. There he sat and looked down on the seashore, viewing his army and his fleet; as he viewed them he desired to see the ships contend in a race. They did so, and the  of  won;  was pleased with the race and with his expedition.\n\n\nWhen he saw the whole  covered with ships, and all the shores and plains of  full of men,  first declared himself blessed, and then wept.\n\n\nHis uncle  perceived this, he who in the beginning had spoken his mind freely and advised  not to march against . Marking how  wept, he questioned him and said, O king, what a distance there is between what you are doing now and a little while ago! After declaring yourself blessed you weep.\n\n said, I was moved to compassion when I considered the shortness of all human life, since of all this multitude of men not one will be alive a hundred years from now.\n\n answered, In one life we have deeper sorrows to bear than that. Short as our lives are, there is no human being either here or elsewhere so fortunate that it will not occur to him, often and not just once, to wish himself dead rather than alive. Misfortunes fall upon us and sicknesses trouble us, so that they make life, though short, seem long.\nLife is so miserable a thing that death has become the most desirable refuge for humans; the god is found to be envious in this, giving us only a taste of the sweetness of living.\n\n\n answered and said, , human life is such as you define it to be. Let us speak no more of that, nor remember evils in our present prosperous estate. But tell me this: if you had not seen the vision in your dream so clearly, would you still have held your former opinion and advised me not to march against , or would you have changed your mind? Come, tell me this truly.\n\n answered and said, O king, may the vision that appeared in my dream bring such an end as we both desire! But I am even now full of fear and beside myself for many reasons, especially when I see that the two greatest things in the world are your greatest enemies.\n\n\n made this response: Are you possessed? What are these two things that you say are my greatest enemies? Is there some fault with the numbers of my land army? Does it seem that the  army will be many times greater than ours? Or do you think that our navy will fall short of theirs? Or that the fault is in both? If our power seems to you to lack anything in this regard, it would be best to muster another army as quickly as possible.\n\n\n answered and said, O king, there is no fault that any man of sound judgment could find either with this army or with the number of your ships; and if you gather more, those two things I speak of become even much more your enemies. These two are the land and the sea.\nThe sea has nowhere any harbor, as I conjecture, that will be able to receive this navy and save your ships if a storm arise. Yet there has to be not just one such harbor, but many of them all along the land you are sailing by.\nSince there are no harbors able to receive you, understand that men are the subjects and not the rulers of their accidents. I have spoken of one of the two, and now I will tell you of the other.\nThe land is your enemy in this way: if nothing is going to stand in your way and hinder you, the land becomes more your enemy the further you advance, constantly unaware of what lies beyond; no man is ever satisfied with success.\nSo I say that if no one opposes you, the increase of your territory and the time passed in getting it will breed famine. The best man is one who is timid while making plans because he takes into account all that may happen to him, but is bold in action.\n\n\n answered, , you define these matters reasonably. But do not fear everything, nor take account of all alike; If you wanted to take everything equally into account on every occasion that happens, you would never do anything; it is better to do everything boldly and suffer half of what you dread than to fear all chances and so never suffer anything.\nBut if you quarrel with whatever is said yet cannot put forth a secure position, you must be proved as wrong on your part as he who holds the contrary opinion. In this both are alike: how can someone who is only human know where there is security? I think it is impossible. Those who have the will to act most often win the rewards, not those who hesitate and take account of all chances.\nYou see what power  has attained. Now if those kings who came before me had held such opinions as yours, or if they had not held them but had had advisers like you, you would never have seen our fortunes at their present height; but as it is those kings ran the risks and advanced them to this height.\nGreat successes are not won except by great risks. So we will do as they did; we are travelling in the fairest season of the year, and we will return home the conquerors of all  without suffering famine or any other harm anywhere. First, we carry ample provisions with us on our march; second, we will have the food of those whose land and nation we invade; for we are marching against men who are tillers of the soil, not nomads.\n\n\nThen said : O king, I see that you will not allow us to fear any danger. But take from me this advice, as there is need for much speaking when our affairs are so great.\n\n son of  subdued and made tributary to  all  except only the . I advise you by no means to lead these  against the land of their fathers, since even without their aid we are well able to overcome our enemies. If they come with our army, they must either behave very unjustly by enslaving their mother city, or very justly by aiding it to be free.\nIf they deal very unjustly they bring us no great advantage, but by dealing very justly they may well do great harm to your army. Take to heart the truth of that ancient saying, that the end of every matter is not revealed at its beginning.\n\n\n answered, , in all your pronouncements you are most mistaken when you fear that the  might change sides; we have the surest guarantee for them, and you and all who marched with  against the  can bear witness. They had the power to destroy or to save the whole  army, and they gave proof of their justice and faithfulness, with no evil intent.\nMoreover, since they have left their children and wives and possessions in our country, we need not consider it even possible that they will make any violent change. So be rid of that fear; keep a stout heart and guard my household and tyranny; to you alone I entrust the symbols of my kingship.\n\n\n spoke thus and sent  away to . He next sent for the most notable among the , and when they were present he said, , I have assembled you to make this demand, that you bear yourselves bravely and never sully the great and glorious former achievements of the . Let us each and all be zealous, for the good that we seek is common to all.\nFor these reasons I bid you set your hands to the war strenuously; I know that we march against valiant men, and if we overcome them it is certain that no other human army will ever withstand us. Let us now cross over, after praying to the gods who hold  for their allotted realm.\n\n\nAll that day they made preparations for the crossing. On the next they waited until they could see the sun rise, burning all kinds of incense on the bridges and strewing the road with myrtle boughs.\nAt sunrise  poured a libation from a golden phial into the sea, praying to the sun that no accident might befall him which would keep him from subduing  before he reached its farthest borders. After the prayer, he cast the phial into the , and along with it a golden bowl, and a  sword which they call acinaces.\nAs for these, I cannot rightly determine whether he cast them into the sea for offerings to the sun, or repented having whipped the  and gave gifts to the sea as atonement.\n\n\nWhen they had done this they crossed over, the foot and horse all by the bridge nearest to the , the beasts of burden and the service train by the bridge towards the .\nThe ten thousand , all wearing garlands, led the way, and after them came the mixed army of diverse nations. All that day these crossed; on the next, first crossed the horsemen and the ones who carried their spears reversed; these also wore garlands.\nAfter them came the sacred horses and the sacred chariot, then  himself and the spearmen and the thousand horse, and after them the rest of the army. Meanwhile the ships put out and crossed to the opposite shore. But I have also heard that the king crossed last of all.\n\n\nWhen  had passed over to , he viewed his army crossing under the lash. Seven days and seven nights it was in crossing, with no pause.\nIt is said that when  had now crossed the , a man of the  cried, O , why have you taken the likeness of a  man and changed your name to , leading the whole world with you to remove  from its place? You could have done that without these means.\n\n\nWhen all had passed over and were ready for the road, a great portent appeared among them.  took no account of it, although it was easy to interpret: a mare gave birth to a hare. The meaning of it was easy to guess:  was to march his army to  with great pomp and pride, but to come back to the same place fleeing for his life.\nThere was another portent that was shown to him at : a mule gave birth to a mule that had double genitals, both male and female, the male above the other. But he took no account of either sign and journeyed onward; the land army was with him.\n\n\nHis navy sailed out of the  and travelled along the land, going across from the land army.\nThe ships sailed westwards, laying their course for the headland of , where  had ordered them to go and wait for him; the army of the mainland travelled towards the east and the sunrise through the , with the tomb of ' daughter Helle on its right and the town of  on its left, marching through the middle of a city called .\nFrom there they rounded the head of the  (as it is called) and crossed the , which could not hold its own then against the army, but gave outcrossing this river, which gives its name to the bay, they went westwards, past the  city of  and the marsh of , until they came to .\n\n\nThe territory of  is in , a wide plain by the sea, and through it flows a great river, the ; here had been built that royal fortress which is called , and a  guard had been posted there by  ever since the time of his march against .\nIt seemed to  to be a fit place for him to arrange and number his army, and he did so. All the ships had now arrived at , and the captains at ' command brought them to the beach near , where stands the  city of Sane, and Zone; at the end is , a well-known headland. This country was in former days possessed by the .\nTo this beach they brought in their ships and hauled them up for rest. Meanwhile  made a reckoning of his forces at .\n\n\nI cannot give the exact number that each part contributed to the total, for there is no one who tells us that; but the total of the whole land army was shown to be one million and seven hundred thousand.\nThey were counted in this way: ten thousand men were collected in one place, and when they were packed together as closely as could be a line was drawn around them; when this was drawn, the ten thousand were sent away and a wall of stones was built on the line reaching up to a man's navel;\n\nwhen this was done, others were brought into the walled space, until in this way all were numbered. When they had been numbered, they were marshalled by nations.\n\n\nThe men who served in the army were the following: the  were equipped in this way: they wore on their heads loose caps called tiaras, and on their bodies embroidered sleeved tunics, with scales of iron like the scales of fish in appearance, and trousers on their legs; for shields they had wicker bucklers, with quivers hanging beneath them; they carried short spears, long bows, and reed arrows, and daggers that hung from the girdle by the right thigh.\nTheir commander was , son of  and father of ' wife. They were formerly called by the  , but by themselves and their neighbors .\nWhen  son of  and  had come to  son of  and married his daughter , a son was born to him whom he called , and he left him there; for  had no male offspring; it was from this  that the  took their name.\n\n\nThe  in the army were equipped like the ; indeed, that fashion of armor is Median, not . Their commander was , an . The  were formerly called by everyone , but when the  woman  came from  to the  they changed their name, like the . This is the ' own account of themselves.\nThe  in the army were equipped like the , but they wore turbans instead of caps. Their commander was  son of . The  were armed like the ; their leader was , who was afterwards the governor of .\n\n\nThe  in the army wore on their heads helmets of twisted bronze made in an outlandish fashion not easy to describe. They carried shields and spears and daggers of  fashion, and also wooden clubs studded with iron, and they wore linen breastplates. They are called by the , but the foreigners called them . With them were the . Their commander was  son of .\n\n\nThe  in the army wore a headgear very similar to the Median, carrying their native reed bows and short spears.\nThe , who are , had on their heads tall caps, erect and stiff and tapering to a point; they wore trousers, and carried their native bows, and daggers, and also axes which they call sagaris. These were , but were called ; that is the  name for all . The commander of the  and  was , son of  and ' daughter .\n\n\nThe  wore garments of tree-wool, and carried reed bows and iron-tipped reed arrows. Such was their equipment; they were appointed to march under the command of  son of .\n\n\nThe  were equipped with Median bows, but in all else like the ; their commander was  son of . The , , , , and  in the army had the same equipment as the .\nThe  and  had for their commander  son of , the  son of , the  and  son of .\n\n\nThe  in the army wore cloaks and carried their native reed bows and short swords.

The  were wrapped in skins of leopards and lions, and carried bows made of palmwood strips, no less than four cubits long, and short arrows pointed not with iron but with a sharpened stone that they use to carve seals; furthermore, they had spears pointed with a gazelle's horn sharpened like a lance, and also studded clubs.\nWhen they went into battle they painted half their bodies with gypsum and the other half with vermilion. The  and the  who dwell above  had as commander , the son of  and  daughter of , whom  loved best of his wives; he had an image made of her of hammered gold.\n\n\nThe  above  and the  had  for commander, while the  of the east (for there were two kinds of them in the army) served with the ; they were not different in appearance from the others, only in speech and hair: the  from the east are straight-haired, but the ones from  have the woolliest hair of all men.\nThese  of  were for the most part armed like the ; but they wore on their heads the skins of horses' foreheads, stripped from the head with ears and mane; the mane served them for a crest, and they wore the horses' ears stiff and upright; for shields they had bucklers of the skin of cranes.\n\n\nThe  came in leather garments, using javelins of burnt wood. Their commander was Massages son of .\n\n\nThe  in the army had woven helmets on their heads, and small shields and short spears, and also javelins and daggers; they wore their native shoes that reach midway to the knee.

These  are called by the .\n\n son of  was commander of the  and ,  son of  and  of the  and  and .\n\n\nThe  equipment was very similar to the , with only a small difference. As the  say, these  were called  as long as they dwelt in , where they were neighbors of the ; but when they changed their home to , they changed their name also and were called .  The , who are settlers from , were armed like the . Both these together had as their commander , who had married a daughter of .\n\n\nThe  armor was most similar to the . The  were formerly called , until they changed their name and were called after  son of . The  wore on their heads their native helmets, carrying small shields and javelins of burnt wood.\nThey are settlers from , and are called  after the mountain . The commander of the  and  was that  son of , who attacked Marathon with .\n\n\nThe  in the army wore fox-skin caps on their heads, and tunics on their bodies; over these they wore embroidered mantles; they had shoes of fawnskin on their feet and legs; they also had javelins and little shields and daggers.\nThey took the name of  after they crossed over to ; before that they were called (as they themselves say) , since they lived by the ; they say that they were driven from their homes by  and . The commander of the  of  was  son of .\n\n\nThe <> had little shields of raw oxhide; each man carried two wolf-hunters' spears; they wore helmets of bronze, and on these helmets were the ears and horns of oxen wrought in bronze, and also crests; their legs were wrapped around with strips of purple rags. Among these men is a place of divination sacred to .\n\n\nThe , who are  and are called , had the same equipment as the ; when I come in my narrative to the place of the , I will then declare what it was. The  had short spears and garments fastened by brooches; some of them carried  bows and wore caps of skin on their heads. The commander of all these was  son of .\n\n\nThe  wore wooden helmets on their heads, and carried shields and small spears with long points. The  and  and  in the army were equipped like the . The commanders who marshalled them were, for the  and ,  son of  and , the daughter of ' son ; for the  and ,  son of , who was governor of  on the .\n\n\nThe  wore on their heads their native woven helmets, and carried javelins and small hide shields. The  had wooden helmets and small shields of raw oxhide and short spears, and also swords. The commander of the Mares and  was  son of . The  and  in the army were armed like the ;  son of  was their commander.\n\n\nThe island tribes that came from the , and from the islands where the king settles those who are called Exiles, wore dress and armor very similar to the Median. The commander of these islanders was  son of , who in the next year was general at  and died in the battle.\n\n\nThese are the nations that marched by the mainland and had their places in the infantry. The commanders of this army were those whom I have mentioned, and they were the ones who marshalled and numbered them and appointed captains of thousands and ten thousands; the captains of ten thousands appointed the captains of hundreds and of tens. There were others who were leaders of companies and nations.\n\n\nThese were the commanders, as I have said; the generals of these and of the whole infantry were  son of ,  son of that  who delivered the opinion that there should be no expedition against ,  son of  (these two latter were sons of ' brothers, and thus they were ' cousins),  son of  and ,  son of , and  son of .\n\n\nThese were the generals of the whole infantry, except the .  son of  was general of these picked ten thousand , who were called Immortals for this reason: when any one of them was forced to fall out of the number by death or sickness, another was chosen so that they were never more or fewer than ten thousand.\nThe  showed the richest adornment of all, and they were the best men in the army. Their equipment was such as I have said; beyond this they stood out by the abundance of gold that they had. They also brought carriages bearing concubines and many well-equipped servants; camels and beasts of burden carried food for them, apart from the rest of the army.\n\n\nThere are horsemen in these nations, but not all of them furnished cavalry. Only the following did so: the , equipped like their infantry, except that some of them wore headgear of hammered bronze and iron.\n\n\nThere are also certain nomads called ; they are  in speech, and the fashion of their equipment is somewhat between the  and the ; they furnished eight thousand horsemen. It is their custom to carry no armor of bronze or iron, except only daggers, and to use ropes of twisted leather.\nThey go to battle relying on these. This is the manner of fighting of these men: when they are at close quarters with their enemy, they throw their ropes, which have a noose at the end; whatever he catches, horse or man, each man drags to himself, and the enemy is entangled in the coils and slain. Such is their manner of fighting; they were marshalled with the .\n\n\nThe  cavalry were equipped like their infantry, and the  similarly. The  were armed in the same manner as their infantry; they rode swift horses and drove chariots drawn by horses and wild asses. The  were equipped as were their foot, and the  in the same manner.\nThe , too, were armed like the men of their infantry, and all of them also drove chariots. In the same manner the  and  were armed as the men of their infantry. The  had the same equipment as the men of their infantry, and all of them rode on camels no less swift than horses.\n\n\nThese nations alone were on horseback; the number of the horsemen was shown to be eighty thousand, besides the camels and the chariots. All the rest of the horsemen were ranked with their companies, but the  were posted last. Since horses cannot endure camels, their place was in the rear, so that the horses would not be frightened.\n\n\nThe captains of cavalry were  and , sons of ; the third who was captain with them, , had been left behind sick at . As they set forth from , an unwelcome mishap befell him: a dog ran under the feet of the horse he was riding, and the horse was taken by surprise and frightened, so it reared up and threw ; after his fall he vomited blood and began to waste away.\nThe horse was immediately dealt with according to ' command; his servants led it away to the place where it had thrown their master, and cut off its legs at the knee. Thus it was that  lost his command.\n\n\nThe number of the triremes was twelve hundred and seven, and they were furnished by the following: the  with the  of  furnished three hundred; for their equipment, they had on their heads helmets very close to the  in style; they wore linen breastplates, and carried shields without rims, and javelins.\nThese  formerly dwelt, as they themselves say, by the ; they crossed from there and now inhabit the seacoast of . This part of  as far as  is all called .\nThe  furnished two hundred ships. They wore woven helmets and carried hollow shields with broad rims, and spears for sea-warfare, and great battle-axes. Most of them wore cuirasses and carried long swords.\n\n\nSuch was their armor. The  furnished a hundred and fifty ships; for their equipment, their princes wore turbans wrapped around their heads, and the people wore tunics, but in all else they were like the . These are their tribes: some are from  and , some from , some from , some from , and some from , as the  themselves say.\n\n\nThe  furnished a hundred ships. They also wore on their heads their native helmets, carried bucklers of raw oxhide for shields, and were clad in woollen tunics; each had two javelins and a sword very close in style to the knives of . These  were formerly called , and took their name from  son of , a .  The  furnished a hundred ships: they were armed like the . These  are descended from the  of the diaspora who followed  and .\n\n\nThe  furnished fifty ships; they wore cuirasses and greaves, and carried cornel-wood bows and unfeathered arrows and javelins; goat-skins hung from their shoulders, and they wore on their heads caps crowned with feathers; they also had daggers and scimitars. The  are from  and were once called ; they took their name from  son of , an .\n\n\nThe  of  furnished thirty ships; their armor was ; they are of  descent. The  furnished seventy ships; they had scimitars and daggers, but the rest of their equipment was . I have said in the beginning of my history what they were formerly called.\n\n\nThe  furnished a hundred ships; their equipment was like the . These , as long as they were in the , dwelt in what is now called , and before  and  came to the , as the  say, they were called . They were named  after Ion the son of .\n\n\nThe islanders provided seventeen ships and were armed like ; they were also of  stock, which was later called  for the same reason as were the  of the twelve cities, who came from . The  furnished sixty ships and were equipped like ; formerly they were called , as the  story goes.\nOf the people of the , the people of  had been charged by the king to remain at home and guard the bridges; the rest of the people from  who came with the army furnished a hundred ships and were equipped like . They were settlers from the  and .\n\n\n and  and  served as soldiers on all the ships. The most seaworthy ships were furnished by the , and among them by the . All of these, as with those who were marshalled in the infantry, each had their native leaders, whose names I do not record, since it is not necessary for the purpose of my history.\nThe leaders of each nation are not worthy of mention, and every city of each nation had a leader of its own. These came not as generals but as slaves, like the rest of the expedition; I have already said who were the generals of supreme authority and the  commanders of each nation.\n\n\nThe admirals of the navy were  son of ,  son of ,  son of , and  son of . , son of  and ' daughter, was admiral of the  and  fleet; the admiral of the  was , full brother of ; and the two others were admirals of the rest. The ships of thirty and of fifty oars, the light galleys, and the great transports for horses came to a total of three thousand all together.\n\n\nAfter the admirals, the most famous of those on board were these: from ,  son of ; from ,  son of ; from ,  son of ; from ,  son of ; from ,  son of ; from ,  son of  and  son of ; and from ,  son of ,  son of , and  son of .\n\n\nI see no need to mention any of the other captains except . I find it a great marvel that a woman went on the expedition against : after her husband died, she took over his tyranny, though she had a young son, and followed the army from youthful spirits and manliness, under no compulsion.\n\n was her name, and she was the daughter of ; on her fathers' side she was of  lineage, and on her mothers' . She was the leader of the men of  and  and  and , and provided five ships.\nHer ships were reputed to be the best in the whole fleet after the ships of , and she gave the king the best advice of all his allies. The cities that I said she was the leader of are all of  stock, as I can show, since the  are from , and the rest are from .\n\n\nHere ends what I have said of the fleet. When his army had been numbered and marshalled,  desired to ride through and view it. Then he did this; as he rode in a chariot past the men of each nation, he questioned them while his scribes wrote it all down, until he had gone from one end to the other of the cavalry and infantry.\nAfter he had done this, the ships were drawn down and launched into the sea.  alighted from his chariot into a  ship and sat under a golden canopy while he was carried past the prows of the ships, questioning the men in the same way as the army and having the answers written down.\nThe captains put out and anchored in line four hundred feet from the shore, with their prows turned landward and the marines armed for war;  viewed them by passing between the prows and the land.\n\n\nAfter he passed by all his fleet and disembarked from the ship, he sent for  son of , who was on the expedition with him against . He summoned him and said, , it is now my pleasure to ask you what I wish to know. You are a , and, as I am told both by you and by the other  whom I have talked to, a man from neither the least nor the weakest of  cities.\nSo tell me: will the  offer battle and oppose me? I think that even if all the  and all the men of the western lands were assembled together, they are not powerful enough to withstand my attack, unless they are united.\nStill I want to hear from you what you say of them. To this question  answered, O king, should I speak the truth or try to please you?  bade him speak the truth and said that it would be no more unpleasant for him than before.\n\n\n heard this and said, O King, since you bid me by all means to speak the whole truth, and to say what you will not later prove to be false, in  poverty is always endemic, but courage is acquired as the fruit of wisdom and strong law; by use of this courage  defends herself from poverty and tyranny.\nNow I praise all the  who dwell in those  lands, yet I am not going to speak these words about all of them, but only about the . First, they will never accept conditions from you that bring slavery upon ; and second, they will meet you in battle even if all the other  are on your side.\nDo not ask me how many these men are who can do this; they will fight with you whether they have an army of a thousand men, or more than that, or less.\n\n\nWhen he heard this,  smiled and said, What a strange thing to say, , that a thousand men would fight with so great an army! Come now, tell me this: you say that you were king of these men. Are you willing right now to fight with ten men? Yet if your state is entirely as you define it, you as their king should by right encounter twice as many according to your laws.\nIf each of them is a match for ten men of my army, then it is plain to me that you must be a match for twenty; in this way you would prove that what you say is true. But if you  who so exalt yourselves are just like you and the others who come to speak with me, and are also the same size, then beware lest the words you have spoken be only idle boasting.\nLet us look at it with all reasonableness: how could a thousand, or ten thousand, or even fifty thousand men, if they are all equally free and not under the rule of one man, withstand so great an army as mine? If you  are five thousand, we still would be more than a thousand to one.\nIf they were under the rule of one man according to our custom, they might out of fear of him become better than they naturally are, and under compulsion of the lash they might go against greater numbers of inferior men; but if they are allowed to go free they would do neither. I myself think that even if they were equal in numbers it would be hard for the  to fight just against the .\nWhat you are talking about is found among us alone, and even then it is not common but rare; there are some among my  spearmen who will gladly fight with three  at once. You have no knowledge of this and are spouting a lot of nonsense.\n\n\nTo this  answered, O king I knew from the first that the truth would be unwelcome to you. But since you compelled me to speak as truly as I could, I have told you how it stands with the .\nYou yourself best know what love I bear them: they have robbed me of my office and the privileges of my house, and made me a cityless exile; your father received me and gave me a house and the means to live on. It is not reasonable for a sensible man to reject goodwill when it appears; rather he will hold it in great affection.\nI myself do not promise that I can fight with ten men or with two, and I would not even willingly fight with one; yet if it were necessary, or if some great contest spurred me, I would most gladly fight with one of those men who claim to be each a match for three .\nSo is it with the ; fighting singly they are as brave as any man living, and together they are the best warriors on earth. They are free, yet not wholly free: law is their master, whom they fear much more than your men fear you.\nThey do whatever it bids; and its bidding is always the same, that they must never flee from the battle before any multitude of men, but must abide at their post and there conquer or die. If I seem to you to speak foolishness when I say this, then let me hereafter hold my peace; it is under constraint that I have now spoken. But may your wish be fulfilled, King.\n\n\nThus  answered.  made a joke of the matter and showed no anger, but sent him away kindly. After he had conversed with , and appointed  son of  governor of this , deposing the governor  had appointed,  marched his army through  towards .\n\n\n left behind this , who so conducted himself that to him alone  always sent gifts, as being the most valiant of all the governors that he or  appointed; he sent these gifts every year, and so did  son of  to ' descendants. Before this march, governors had been appointed everywhere in  and on the .\nAll of these in  and the , except the governor of , were after this expedition captured by the ; but no one could ever drive out  in , though many tried. For this reason gifts are sent by the successive kings of .\n\n\nThe only one of those who were driven out by the  whom king  considered a valiant man was , from whom they took . He never ceased praising this man, and gave very great honor to his sons who were left alive in ; indeed  proved himself worthy of all praise. When he was besieged by the  under  son of , he could have departed under treaty from  and returned to , but he refused, lest the king think that he had saved his life out of cowardice; instead he resisted to the last.\nWhen there was no food left within his walls, he piled up a great pyre and slew his children and wife and concubines and servants and cast them into the fire; after that, he took all the gold and silver from the city and scattered it from the walls into the ; after he had done this, he cast himself into the fire. Thus he is justly praised by the  to this day.\n\n\nFrom   went on his way towards , compelling all that he met to go with his army. As I have shown earlier, all the country as far as  had been enslaved and was tributary to the king, by the conquests of  and  after him.\nOn his road from  he first passed the  fortresses; of these, the city built farthest to the west is called . Next to it is the  city of ; between them runs the river , which now could not furnish water enough for ' army, but was exhausted.\nAll this region was once called , but it is now called ; however, by rights it also belongs to the .\n\n\nAfter he had crossed the dried-up bed of the river , he passed by the  cities of , , and . He passed by these, and along certain well-known lakes near them: the  that lies between  and , and near  the , into which the rivers  and  discharge. Near   passed no well-known lake, but crossed the river  where it flows into the sea.\nFrom these regions he passed by the cities of the mainland, one of which has near it a lake of about thirty stadia in circuit, full of fish and very salty; this was drained dry by watering the beasts of burden alone. This city is called .\n\n\n marched past these  cities of the coast, keeping them on his left. The  tribes through whose lands he journeyed were the , , , , , , and . Of these, the ones who dwelt by the sea followed his army on shipboard; the ones living inland, whose names I have recorded, were forced to join with his land army, all of them except the .\n\n\nThe , as far as we know, have never yet been subject to any man; they alone of the  have continued living in freedom to this day; they dwell on high mountains covered with forests of all kinds and snow, and they are excellent warriors.\nIt is they who possess the place of divination sacred to . This place is in their highest mountains; the , a clan of the , are the prophets of the shrine; there is a priestess who utters the oracle, as at ; it is no more complicated here than there.\n\n\nAfter passing through the aforementioned land,  next passed the fortresses of the , one called  and the other . By going this way he marched right under their walls, keeping on his right the great and high , where the  and  and especially the  have gold and silver mines.\n\n\nMarching past the , , and , who dwell beyond and northward of the , he kept going westwards, until he came to the river  and the city of ; its governor was that , then still alive, whom I mentioned just before this.\nAll this region about the  is called ; it stretches westwards to the river , which issues into the , and southwards to the  itself; at this river the  sought good omens by sacrificing white horses.\n\n\nAfter using these enchantments and many others besides on the river, they passed over it at the  in  country, by the bridges which they found thrown across the . When they learned that  was the name of the place, they buried alive that number of boys and maidens, children of the local people.\nTo bury people alive is a  custom; I have learned by inquiry that when ' wife  reached old age, she buried twice seven sons of notable  as an offering on her own behalf to the fabled god beneath the earth.\n\n\nJourneying from the , the army passed by , a  town standing on a stretch of coast further westwards; the territory of this town and that which lies inland of it are called .\nFrom there, keeping on his left hand the gulf off ,  traversed the plain of  (as they call it), passing by the  town of , and came to . He took along with him all these tribes and those that dwelt about the , just as he did those previously mentioned, the men of the coast serving in his fleet and the inland men in his land army.\nThe entire road along which king  led his army the  neither break up nor sow, but they hold it in great reverence to this day.\n\n\nWhen  came to , he declared the  his guests and friends, and gave them Median clothing, praising them for the zeal with which he saw them furthering his campaign, and for what he heard of the digging of the canal.\n\n\nWhile  was at , it happened that , overseer of the digging of the canal, died of an illness. He was high in ' favor, an  by lineage, and the tallest man in , lacking four finger-breadths of five royal cubits in stature, and his voice was the loudest on earth. For this reason  mourned him greatly and gave him a funeral and burial of great pomp, and the whole army poured libations on his tomb.\nThe  hold  a hero, and sacrifice to him, calling upon his name. This they do at the command of an oracle.\n\n\n, then, mourned for the death of . But the  who received ' army and entertained the king himself were brought to such a degree of misery, that they were driven from house and home. Witness the case of the , who received and feasted ' army on behalf of their towns on the mainland;  son of , as notable a man as any of his townsmen, chosen by them for this task, rendered them an account of four hundred silver talents expended on the dinner.\n\n\nSimilar accounts were returned by the officers in the other towns. Now the dinner, about which a great deal of fuss had been made and for the preparation of which orders had been given long ago, proceeded as I will tell.\nAs soon as the townsmen had word from the herald's proclamation, they divided corn among themselves in their cities and all of them for many months ground it to wheat and barley meal; moreover, they fed the finest beasts that money could buy, and kept landfowl and waterfowl in cages and ponds, for the entertaining of the army. They also made gold and silver cups and bowls and all manner of service for the table.\nThese things were provided for the king himself and those that ate with him. For the rest of the army they provided only food. At the coming of the army, there was always a tent ready for  to take his rest in, while the men camped out in the open air.\nWhen the hour came for dinner, the real trouble for the hosts began. When they had eaten their fill and passed the night there, the army tore down the tent on the next day and marched off with all the movables, leaving nothing but carrying all with them.\n\n\nIt was then that a very apt saying was uttered by one  of . He advised his townsmen, men and women alike, to gather at their temples, and there in all humility to entreat the gods to defend them in the future from half of every threatened ill. They should also, he said, thank the gods heartily for their previous show of favor, for it was ' custom to take a meal only once a day. Otherwise they would have been commanded to furnish a breakfast similar to the dinner.\nThe people of  would then have had no choice but to flee before ' coming, or to perish most miserably if they awaited him.\n\n\nSo the townsmen, oppressed as they were, nevertheless did as they were commanded. Upon leaving ,  sent his ships on their course away from him, giving orders to his generals that the fleet should await him at , the town on the  which gives the gulf its name, for this, he learned, was his shortest way.\nThe order of the army's march, from  to , had been such as I will show. Dividing his entire land army into three parts,  appointed one of them to march beside his fleet along the coast.\n\n and  were the generals of this segment, while another third of the army marched, as appointed, further inland under  and . The third part, with which  himself went, marched between the two, and its generals were  and .\n\n\nNow when the fleet had left , it sailed through the  canal which reached to the gulf in which are located the towns of , , , and . The fleet took on board troops from all these cities and then headed for the . Then rounding , the headland of , it passed the  towns of , , , , and , all of which gave them ships and men.\n\n\nThis country is called . The fleet held a straight course from the headland of  to the , where  runs farthest out to sea, and received ships and men from the towns of what is now  but was formerly called , namely, , , , , , , Mende, and Sane.\nSailing along this coast they made for the appointed place, taking troops from the towns adjacent to  and near the , of which the names are , , , , , , ; the territory of these cities is called  to this day.\nFrom , the last-named in my list of the towns, the course of the fleet lay from the  itself and the  territory until its voyage ended at , the place appointed, and the towns of  and , where it came to the river ; this is the boundary, between the  and the  territory, in which are located the towns of  and  on the narrow strip of coast.\n\n\nSo the fleet lay there off the river  and the city of  and the towns between them, awaiting the king. But  and his land army marched from  by the straightest inland course, making for . Their way lay through the  and the  country to the river , which, rising in the  land, flows through the  country and issues by the marshes of the .\n\n\nAs  marched by this route, lions attacked the camels which carried his provisions; nightly they would come down out of their lairs and made havoc of the camels alone, seizing nothing else, man or beast of burden. I wonder what prevented the lions from touching anything but the camels, creatures which they had not seen and had no knowledge of until then.\n\n\nIn these parts there are many lions and wild oxen, whose horns are those very long ones which are brought into . The boundary of the lions' country is the river  which flows through  and the river  which flows through . Neither to the east of the  anywhere in the nearer part of , nor to the west of the  in the rest of the mainland, is any lion to be seen, but they are found in the country between those rivers.\n\n\nWhen he had arrived at ,  quartered his army there. Its encampment by the sea covered all the space from  and the  country to the rivers  and , which unite their waters in one stream and so make the border between the  and the  territory.\n\n In this place the foreigners lay encamped; of the rivers just mentioned, the , which flows from the  country, was the only one which could not suffice for the army's drinking but was completely drained by it.\n\n\nWhen  saw from  the very great height of the   and  and learned that the  flows through them in a narrow pass, which was the way that led into , he desired to view the mouth of the  because he intended to march by the upper road through the highland people of  to the country of the  and the town of ; this, it was told him, was the safest way.\nHe did exactly as he desired. He embarked on a  ship which he always used when he had some such business in hand, and hoisted his signal for the rest also to put out to sea, leaving his land army where it was. Great wonder took him when he came and viewed the mouth of the , and calling his guides, he asked them if it were possible to turn the river from its course and lead it into the sea by another way.\n\n\n, as tradition has it, was in old times a lake enclosed all round by high mountains. On its eastern side it is fenced in by the joining of the lower parts of the mountains  and , to the north by , to the west by , towards the south and the southerly wind by . In the middle, then, of this ring of mountains, lies the vale of .\nA number of rivers pour into this vale, the most notable of which are , , , , . These five, while they flow towards their meeting place from the mountains which surround , have their several names, until their waters all unite and issue into the sea by one narrow passage.\nAs soon as they are united, the name of the  prevails, making the rest nameless. In ancient days, it is said, there was not yet this channel and outfall, but those rivers and the , which was not yet named, had the same volume of water as now, and thereby turned all  into a sea.\nNow the  say that  made the passage by which the  flows. This is reasonable, for whoever believes that  is the shaker of the earth and that rifts made by earthquakes are the work of that god will conclude, upon seeing that passage, that it is of 's making. It was manifest to me that it must have been an earthquake which forced the mountains apart.\n\n\n asked his guides if there were any other outlet for the  into the sea, and they, with their full knowledge of the matter, answered him: The river, O king, has no other way into the sea, but this alone. This is so because there is a ring of mountains around the whole of . Upon hearing this  said: These  are wise men;\n\nthis, then, was the primary reason for their precaution long before when they changed to a better mind, for they perceived that their country would be easily and speedily conquerable. It would only have been necessary to let the river out over their land by barring the channel with a dam and to turn it from its present bed so that the whole of , with the exception of the mountains, might be under water.\nThis he said with regard in particular to the sons of , the  who were the first  to surrender themselves to the king.  supposed that when they offered him friendship they spoke for the whole of their nation. After delivering this speech and seeing what he had come to see, he sailed back to .\n\n\n stayed for many days in the region of  while a third part of his army was clearing a road over the  so that the whole army might pass by that way to the  country. Now it was that the heralds who had been sent to  to demand earth, some empty-handed, some bearing earth and water, returned.\n\n\nAmong those who paid that tribute were the , , , , , , ,  of , , and all the  except the men of  and .\nAgainst all of these the  who declared war with the foreigner entered into a sworn agreement, which was this: that if they should be victorious, they would dedicate to the god of  the possessions of all  who had of free will surrendered themselves to the . Such was the agreement sworn by the .\n\n\nTo  and   sent no heralds to demand earth, and this he did for the following reason. When  had previously sent men with this same purpose, those who made the request were cast at the one city into the Pit and at the other into a well, and bidden to obtain their earth and water for the king from these locations.\nWhat calamity befell the  for dealing in this way with the heralds I cannot say, save that their land and their city were laid waste. I think, however, that there was another reason for this, and not the aforesaid.\n\n\nBe that as it may, the anger of , 's herald, fell upon the . At  there is a shrine of  and descendants of  called , who have the special privilege of conducting all embassies from .\nNow there was a long period after the incident I have mentioned above during which the  were unable to obtain good omens from sacrifice. The  were grieved and dismayed by this and frequently called assemblies, making a proclamation inviting some  to give his life for . Then two  of noble birth and great wealth,  son of  and  son of , undertook of their own free will to make atonement to  for ' heralds who had been killed at .\nThereupon the  sent these men to Media for execution.\n\n\nWorthy of admiration was these men's deed of daring, and so also were their sayings. On their way to , they came to , a , who was general of the coast of . He entertained and feasted them as his guests, and as they sat at his board, he asked:\n\n, why do you shun the king's friendship? You can judge from what you see of me and my condition how well the king can honor men of worth. So might it be with you if you would but put yourselves in the king's hands, being as you are of proven worth in his eyes, and every one of you might by his commission be a ruler of .\nTo this the  answered: Your advice to us, , is not completely sound; one half of it rests on knowledge, but the other on ignorance. You know well how to be a slave, but you, who have never tasted freedom, do not know whether it is sweet or not. Were you to taste of it, not with spears you would counsel us to fight for it, no, but with axes.\n\n\nThis was their answer to . From there they came to , into the king's presence, and when the guards commanded and would have compelled them to fall down and bow to the king, they said they would never do that. This they would refuse even if they were thrust down headlong, for it was not their custom, said they, to bow to mortal men, nor was that the purpose of their coming. Having averted that, they next said,\n\nThe  have sent us, O king of the , in requital for the slaying of your heralds at , to make atonement for their death, and more to that effect. To this , with great magnanimity, replied that he would not imitate the . You, said he, made havoc of all human law by slaying heralds, but I will not do that for which I censure you, nor by putting you in turn to death will I set the  free from this guilt.\n\n\nThis conduct on the part of the  succeeded for a time in allaying the anger of , in spite of the fact that  and  returned to . Long after that, however, it rose up again in the war between the  and , as the  say. That seems to me to be an indication of something divine.\nIt was just that the wrath of  descended on ambassadors, nor abated until it was satisfied. The venting of it, however, on the sons of those men who went up to the king to appease it, namely on  son of  and  son of  (that  who landed a merchant ships crew at the  settlement of  and took it), makes it plain to me that this was the divine result of ' anger.\nThese two had been sent by the  as ambassadors to , and betrayed by the  king  son of  and  son of  of , they were made captive at  on the , and carried away to , where the  put them, and with them  son of , a , to death. This happened many years after the king's expedition, and I return now to the course of my history.\n\n\nThe professed intent of the king's march was to attack , but in truth all  was his aim. This the  had long since learned, but not all of them regarded the matter alike.\nThose of them who had paid the tribute of earth and water to the  were of good courage, thinking that the foreigner would do them no harm, but they who had refused tribute were afraid, since there were not enough ships in  to do battle with their invader; furthermore, the greater part of them had no stomach for grappling with the war, but were making haste to side with the .\n\n\nHere I am forced to declare an opinion which will be displeasing to most, but I will not refrain from saying what seems to me to be true.\nHad the  been panic-struck by the threatened peril and left their own country, or had they not indeed left it but remained and surrendered themselves to , none would have attempted to withstand the king by sea. What would have happened on land if no one had resisted the king by sea is easy enough to determine.\nAlthough the  had built not one but many walls across the Isthmus for their defense, they would nevertheless have been deserted by their allies (these having no choice or free will in the matter, but seeing their cities taken one by one by the foreign fleet), until at last they would have stood alone. They would then have put up quite a fight and perished nobly.\nSuch would have been their fate. Perhaps, however, when they saw the rest of  siding with the enemy, they would have made terms with . In either case  would have been subdued by the , for I cannot see what advantage could accrue from the walls built across the isthmus, while the king was master of the seas.\nAs it is, to say that the  were the saviors of  is to hit the truth. It was the  who held the balance; whichever side they joined was sure to prevail.  choosing that  should preserve her freedom, the  roused to battle the other  states which had not yet gone over to the  and, after the gods, were responsible for driving the king off.\nNor were they moved to desert  by the threatening oracles which came from  and sorely dismayed them, but they stood firm and had the courage to meet the invader of their country.\n\n\nThe  had sent messages to  asking that an oracle be given them, and when they had performed all due rites at the temple and sat down in the inner hall, the priestess, whose name was , gave them this answer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the  messengers heard that, they were very greatly dismayed, and gave themselves up for lost by reason of the evil foretold. Then  son of , as notable a man as any , advised them to take boughs of supplication and in the guise of suppliants, approach the oracle a second time.\nThe  did exactly this; Lord, they said, regard mercifully these suppliant boughs which we bring to you, and give us some better answer concerning our country. Otherwise we will not depart from your temple, but remain here until we die. Thereupon the priestess gave them this second oracle:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis answer seemed to be and really was more merciful than the first, and the envoys, writing it down, departed for . When the messengers had left  and laid the oracle before the people, there was much inquiry concerning its meaning, and among the many opinions which were uttered, two contrary ones were especially worthy of note. Some of the elder men said that the gods answer signified that the acropolis should be saved, for in old time the acropolis of  had been fenced by a thorn hedge,\n\nwhich, by their interpretation, was the wooden wall. But others supposed that the god was referring to their ships, and they were for doing nothing but equipping these. Those who believed their ships to be the wooden wall were disabled by the two last verses of the oracle: \n\n\nThese verses confounded the opinion of those who said that their ships were the wooden wall, for the readers of oracles took the verses to mean that they should offer battle by sea near  and be there overthrown.\n\n\nNow there was a certain , by name and title  son of , who had lately risen to be among their chief men. He claimed that the readers of oracles had incorrectly interpreted the whole of the oracle and reasoned that if the verse really pertained to the , it would have been formulated in less mild language, calling  cruel rather than divine  seeing that its inhabitants were to perish.\nCorrectly understood, the gods' oracle was spoken not of the  but of their enemies, and his advice was that they should believe their ships to be the wooden wall and so make ready to fight by sea.\nWhen  put forward this interpretation, the  judged him to be a better counsellor than the readers of oracles, who would have had them prepare for no sea fight, and, in short, offer no resistance at all, but leave  and settle in some other country.\n\n\nThe advice of  had prevailed on a previous occasion. The revenues from the mines at  had brought great wealth into the ' treasury, and when each man was to receive ten drachmae for his share,  persuaded the  to make no such division but to use the money to build two hundred ships for the war, that is, for the war with .\nThis was in fact the war the outbreak of which saved  by compelling the  to become seamen. The ships were not used for the purpose for which they were built, but later came to serve  in her need. These ships, then, had been made and were already there for the ' service, and now they had to build yet others.\nIn their debate after the giving of the oracle they accordingly resolved that they would put their trust in the god and meet the foreign invader of  with the whole power of their fleet, ships and men, and with all other  who were so minded.\n\n\nThese oracles, then, had been given to the . All the  who were concerned about the general welfare of  met in conference and exchanged guarantees. They resolved in debate to make an end of all their feuds and wars against each other, whatever the cause from which they arose; among others that were in course at that time, the greatest was the war between the  and the .\nPresently, learning that  was at  with his army, they planned to send men into  to spy out the king's doings and to despatch messengers, some to , who should make the  their brothers in arms against the , some to  son of  in , some to , praying aid for , and some to . This they did in the hope that since the danger threatened all  alike, all of  blood might unite and work jointly for one common end. Now the power of  was said to be very great, surpassing by far any power in .\n\n\nBeing so resolved and having composed their quarrels, they first sent three men as spies into . These came to  and took note of the king's army. They were discovered, however, and after examination by the generals of the land army, they were led away for execution.\nThey were condemned to die, but when  heard of it, he blamed the judgment of his generals and sent some of his guards, charging them to bring the spies before him if they should be found alive.\nThey were found still living and brought into the king's presence; then , having inquired of them the purpose of their coming, ordered his guards to lead them around and show them his whole army. When the spies had seen all to their heart's content, they were to send them away unharmed to whatever country they pleased.\n\n\nThe reason alleged for his command was this: had the spies been put to death, the  would not so soon have learned the unspeakable greatness of his power, and the  would have done their enemy no great harm by putting three men to death.  said that if they should return to , the  would hear of his power and would surrender their peculiar freedom before the expedition with the result that there would be no need to march against them.\nThis was like that other saying of  when he was at  and saw ships laden with corn sailing out of the  through the  on their way to  and the . His counsellors, perceiving that they were enemy ships, were for taking them, and looked to the king for orders to do so.\n\n, however, asked them where the ships were sailing, and they answered: To your enemies, Sire, carrying corn.  then answered, And are not we too sailing to the same places as they, with corn among all our other provisions? What wrong are they doing us in carrying food there?\n\n\nSo the spies were sent back after they had seen all and returned to . After sending the spies, those of the  who had sworn alliance against the  next sent messengers to .\nNow this is what the  say of their own part in the matter. They were informed from the first that the foreigner was stirring up war against . When they learned that the  would attempt to gain their aid against the , they sent messengers to  to inquire of the god how it would be best for them to act, for six thousand of them had been lately slain by a  army and  son of  its general. For this reason, they said, the messengers were sent.\nThe priestess gave this answer to their question: \n\nThis answer had already been uttered by the priestess when the envoys arrived in  and entered the council chamber to speak as they were charged.\nThen the  answered to what had been said that they would do as was asked of them if they might first make a thirty years peace with  and if the command of half the allied power were theirs. It was their right to have the full command, but they would nevertheless be content with half.\n\n\nThis, they say, was the answer of their council, although the oracle forbade them to make the alliance with the ; furthermore, they, despite their fear of the oracle, were eager to secure a thirty years treaty so that their children might have time in those years to grow to be men. If there were to be no such treatyso they reasonedthen, if after the evil that had befallen them the  should deal them yet another blow, it was to be feared that they would be at the ' mercy.\nThen those of the envoys who were  replied to the demands of the council, saying that they would refer the question of the truce to their own government at home; as for the command, however, they themselves had been commissioned to say that the  had two kings, and the  but one. Now it was impossible to deprive either  of his command, but there was nothing to prevent the  from having the same right of voting as their two had.\nAt that, say the , they decided that the ' covetousness was past all bearing and that it was better to be ruled by the foreigners than give way to the . They then bade the envoys depart from the land of  before sunset, for they would otherwise be treated as enemies.\n\n\nSuch is the ' account of this matter, but there is another story told in , namely that before  set forth on his march against , he sent a herald to , who said on his coming (so the story goes),\n\nMen of , this is the message to you from .  our forefather had, as we believe,  son of  for his father, and  daughter of  for his mother; if that is so, then we are descended from your nation. In all right and reason we should therefore neither march against the land of our forefathers, nor should you become our enemies by aiding others or do anything but abide by yourselves in peace. If all goes as I desire, I will hold none in higher esteem than you.\nThe  were strongly moved when they heard this, and although they made no promise immediately and demanded no share, they later, when the  were trying to obtain their support, did make the claim, because they knew that the  would refuse to grant it, and that they would thus have an excuse for taking no part in the war.\n\n\nThis is borne out, some of the  say, by the tale of a thing which happened many years afterwards. It happened that while  envoys,  son of , and the rest who had come up with him, were at , called the , about some other business, the  also had at this same time sent envoys to , asking of ' son  whether the friendship which they had forged with  still held good, as they desired, or whether he considered them as his enemies.  responded to this that it did indeed hold good and that he believed no city to be a better friend to him than .\n\n\nNow, whether it is true that  sent a herald with such a message to , and that the  envoys came up to  and questioned  about their friendship, I cannot say with exactness, nor do I now declare that I consider anything true except what the  themselves say.\nThis, however, I know full well, namely if all men should carry their own private troubles to market for barter with their neighbors, there would not be a single one who, when he had looked into the troubles of other men, would not be glad to carry home again what he had brought.\nThe conduct of the  was accordingly not utterly shameful. As for myself, although it is my business to set down that which is told me, to believe it is none at all of my business. This I ask the reader to hold true for the whole of my history, for there is another tale current, according to which it would seem that it was the  who invited the  into , because the war with the  was going badly, and they would prefer anything to their present distresses.\n\n\nSuch is the end of the story of the . As for , envoys were sent there by the allies to hold converse with ,  from  among them. The ancestor of this , who settled at , was from the island of  which lies off . When the founding of  by  and the  of  was happening, he would not be left behind.\nHis descendants in time became and continue to be priests of the goddesses of the underworld; this office had been won, as I will show, by , one of their forefathers. There were certain  who had been worsted in party strife and had been banished to the town of , inland of .\nThese men  brought to  with no force of men but only the holy instruments of the goddesses worship to aid him. From where he got these, and whether or not they were his own invention, I cannot say; however that may be, it was in reliance upon them that he restored the exiles, on the condition that his descendants should be ministering priests of the goddesses.\nNow it makes me marvel that  should have achieved such a feat, for I have always supposed that such feats cannot be performed by any man but only by such as have a stout heart and manly strength. , however, is reported by the dwellers in  to have had a soft and effeminate disposition.\n\n\nAt the death of  son of , who had been tyrant of  for seven years, and had been slain by a man of that city named , the sovereignty passed to ' brother . While  was tyrant, , a descendant of the ministering priest , was one of ' guard, as were  son of  and many others.\nIn no long time he was appointed for his worth to be captain of the entire cavalry, for his performance had been preeminent while he served under  in the assaults against , , , , , and many other of the foreigners' towns. None of these cities, with the exception of , escaped enslavement by ; the  were defeated in battle on the river .\nThey were, however, rescued by the  and , who made a peace for them on the condition that the  should deliver up to  , which had formerly been theirs.\n\n\nWhen , too, after reigning the same number of years as his brother , came to his end near the town of from where he had marched against the then  made a pretence of serving the cause of ' sons  and , whose rule the citizens would no longer bear. When he had defeated the men of , however, he deposed the sons of  and held sway himself.\nAfter this stroke of good fortune,  brought back from the town of  to  both the so-called landed gentry of , who had been driven into exile by the common people, and their slaves, the . He then took possession of that city also, for the  common people surrendered themselves and it to  at his coming.\n\n\nWhen he had made  his own, he took less account of his rule over , which he gave in charge to his brother ; over  he reigned, and all his care was for .\nStraightway that city grew and became great, for not only did  bring all the people of  to  and give them its citizenship, razing the township of , but he did the same thing to more than half of the townsmen of , and when the  in  surrendered to him on terms after a siege, he took the wealthier of them, who had made war on him and expected to be put to death for this, and brought them to  to be citizens there. As for the common people of , who had had no hand in the making of that war and expected that no harm would be done them, these too he brought to  and sold them for slaves to be taken out of .\nHe dealt in a similar way with the  of , making the same distinction. The reason for his treating the people of both places in this way was that he held the common people to be exceedingly disagreeable to live with.\n\n\nBy these means  had grown to greatness as a tyrant, and now, when the  envoys had come to , they had audience with him and spoke as follows: The  and their allies have sent us to win your aid against the foreigner, for it cannot be, we think, that you have no knowledge of the  invader of , how he proposes to bridge the  and lead all the hosts of the east from  against us, making an open show of marching against , but actually with intent to subdue all  to his will.\nNow you are rich in power, and as lord of  you rule what is not the least part of ; therefore, we beg of you, send help to those who are going to free , and aid them in so doing. The uniting of all those of  stock entails the mustering of a mighty host able to meet our invaders in the field. If, however, some of us play false and others will not come to our aid, while the sound part of  is but small, then it is to be feared that all  lands alike will be destroyed.\nDo not for a moment think that if the  defeats us in battle and subdues us, he will leave you unassailed, but rather look well to yourself before that day comes. Aid us, and you champion your own cause; in general a well-laid plan leads to a happy issue.\n\n\nThis is what they said, and , speaking very vehemently, said in response to this: Men of , it is with a self-seeking plea that you have dared to come here and invite me to be your ally against the foreigners; yet what of yourselves?\nWhen I was at odds with the , and asked you to be my comrades against a foreign army, and when I desired that you should avenge the slaying of  son of  on the men of , and when I promised to free those trading ports from which great advantage and profit have accrued to you,then neither for my sake would you come to aid nor to avenge the slaying of . Because of your position in these matters, all these lands lie beneath the foreigners' feet.\nLet that be; for all ended well, and our state was improved. But now that the war has come round to you in your turn, it is time for remembering !\nDespite the fact that you slighted me, I will not make an example of you; I am ready to send to your aid two hundred triremes, twenty thousand men-at-arms, two thousand horsemen, two thousand archers, two thousand slingers, and two thousand light-armed men to run with horsemen. I also pledge to furnish provisions for the whole  army until we have made an end of the war.\nAll this, however, I promise on one condition, that I shall be general and leader of the  against the foreigner. On no other condition will I come myself or send others.\n\n\nWhen  heard that, he could not contain himself; In truth, he cried, loudly would  son of  lament, when hearing that the  had been bereft of their command by  and his ! No, rather, put the thought out of your minds that we will give up the command to you. If it is your will to aid , know that you must obey the ; but if, as I think, you are too proud to obey, then send no aid.\n\n\nThereupon , seeing how unfriendly ' words were, for the last time declared his opinion to them: My  friend, the hard words that a man hears are likely to arouse his anger; but for all the arrogant tenor of your speech you will not move me to make an unseemly answer.\nWhen you set such store by the command, it is but reasonable that it should be still more important to me since I am the leader of an army many times greater than yours and more ships by far. But seeing that your response to me is so haughty, we will make some concession in our original condition. It might be that you should command the army, and I the fleet; or if it is your pleasure to lead by sea, then I am ready to take charge of the army. With that you will surely be content, unless you want depart from here without such allies as we are.\n\n\nSuch was 's offer, and the  envoy answered him before the  could speak. King of the , he said,  sends us to you to ask not for a leader but for an army. You however, say no word of sending an army without the condition of your being the leader of ; it is the command alone that you desire.\nNow as long as you sought the leadership of the whole force, we  were content to hold our peace, knowing that the  was well able to answer for both of us; but since, failing to win the whole, you would gladly command the fleet, we want to let you know how the matter stands. Even if the  should permit you to command it, we would not do so, for the command of the fleet, which the  do not desire for themselves, is ours. If they should desire to lead it, we will not withstand them, but we will not allow anyone else to be admiral.\nIt would be for nothing, then, that we possess the greatest number of seafaring men in , if we  yield our command to ,we who can demonstrate the longest lineage of all and who alone among the  have never changed our place of habitation; of our stock too was the man of whom the poet Homer says that of all who came to , he was the best man in ordering and marshalling armies. We accordingly cannot be reproached for what we now say. \n\n\nMy  friend,  answered, it would seem that you have many who lead, but none who will follow. Since, then, you will waive no claim but must have the whole, it is high time that you hasten home and tell your  that her year has lost its spring.\n\n The significance of this statement was that 's army was the most notable part of the  army, just as the spring is the best part of the year. He accordingly compared  deprived of alliance with him to a year bereft of its spring.\n\n\nAfter such dealings with  the  envoys sailed away. , however, feared that the  would not be able to overcome the barbarian, while believing it dreadful and intolerable that he, the tyrant of , should go to the  to be at the beck and call of . For this reason he took no more thought of this plan but followed another instead.\nAs soon as he was informed that the  had crossed the , he sent  son of Scythes, a man of , to  with three fifty-oared ships, bringing them money and messages of friendship.  was to observe the outcome of the battle, and if the barbarian should be victorious, he was to give him both the money, and earth and water on behalf of 's dominions. If, however, the  were victorious, he was to bring everything back again.\n\n\nThis  had previously inherited from his father the tyranny of . Although the tyranny was well established, he nevertheless handed the government over to the whole body of  of his own free will. This he did under no constraint of danger, but out of a sense of justice, and he then went to , where he was given by the  the city of  which he colonized and changed its name to .\nThis is how  had come, and it was he whom  now sent because of his sense of justice. What I will now relate was not the least of the many just acts of ' life; he had in his possession great wealth entrusted to him by  and might have kept it. He nevertheless would not do so, but when the  had prevailed in the sea-fight and  had headed home,  returned to  with all that money.\n\n\nThere is, however, another story told by the : even though he was to be under  authority,  would still have aided the  had it not been for  son of , the tyrant of . This man, who had been expelled from  by  son of , sovereign ruler of , at this very time brought against  three hundred thousand , , , , , , and , led by  son of , the king of the .  had induced him to do this partly through the prerogative of personal friendship, but mainly through the efforts of  son of Cretines, tyrant of . He had handed over his own children as hostages to , and brought him into  to the help of his father-in-law; for  had as his wife ' daughter . Accordingly  sent the money to , because he could not aid the .\n\n\nThey add this tale toothat  and  won a victory over  the  in  on the same day that the  defeated the  at . This  was, on his father's side, a , and a  on his mother's and had been made king of  for his virtue. When the armies met and he was defeated in the battle, it is said that he vanished from sight, for  looked for him everywhere but was not able to find him anywhere on earth, dead or alive.\n\n\nThe story told by the  themselves seems to have some element of truth. They say that the barbarians fought with the  in  from dawn until late evening (so long, it is said, the battle was drawn out), during which time  stayed in his camp offering sacrifice and striving to obtain favorable omens by burning whole bodies on a great pyre. When he saw his army routed, he cast himself into the fire where he was pouring libations on the sacrifice; he was consumed by this and was not seen any more.\nWhether he vanished as the  say, or in the manner related by the  and , sacrifice is offered to him, and monuments have been set up in all the colonists' cities, the greatest of which is in  itself.\n\n\nThis is how the campaign in  fell out. As for the , their answer to the envoys and their acts were as I will show. The men who had gone to  sought their aid too, using the same arguments which they had used with . The  straightaway promised to send help and protection, declaring that they would not allow  to perish, for if she should fall, the very next day would certainly see them also enslaved. They would accordingly have to help to the best of their ability.\nNow this answer seemed fair enough, but when the time came for sending help, their minds changed. They manned sixty ships and put out to sea, making for the coast of the . There, however, they anchored off  and  in the  territory, waiting like the others to see which way the war should incline. They had no hope that the  would prevail, but thought that the  would win a great victory and be lord of all .\nTheir course of action, therefore, had been planned with a view to being able to say to the , O king, we whose power is as great as any and who could have furnished as many ships as any state save ,we, when the  attempted to gain our aid in this war, would not resist you nor do anything displeasing to you. This plea, they hoped, would win them some advantage more than ordinary; and so, I believe, it would have been.\nThey were, however, also ready with an excuse which they could make to the , and in the end they made it; when the  blamed them for sending no help, they said that they had manned sixty triremes, but that they could not round  because of the  winds. It was for this reason, they said, that they could not arrive at ; it was not cowardliness which made them late for the sea-fight. With such a plea they put the  off.\n\n\nBut the , when the  appointed to deal with them were trying to gain their aid, acted as I will show. They sent messengers to , inquiring if it would be to their advantage to help the .\nThe  answered them, Foolish men, was not the grief enough which  sent upon your people for the help given to , out of anger that those others would not help to avenge his death at , while you helped them to avenge the stealing of that woman from  by a barbarian? When this was brought to the ears of the , they would have nothing to do with aiding the .\n\n\nNow , it is said, went to , which is now called , in search for , and perished there by a violent death. Presently all the  except the men of  and  were bidden by a god to go with a great host to . Here they besieged the town of , where in my day the men of  dwelt, for five years.\nPresently, since they could neither take it nor remain there because of the famine which afflicted them, they departed. However, when they were at sea off , a great storm caught and drove them ashore. Because their ships had been wrecked and there was no way left of returning to , they founded there the town of , and made this their dwelling place, accordingly changing from  to  of , and from islanders to dwellers on the mainland.\nFrom  they made settlements in those other towns which a very long time afterwards the  attempted to destroy, thereby suffering great disaster. The result was that no one has ever heard of so great a slaughter of  as that of the  and ; three thousand townsmen of the latter, men who had been coerced by  son of  to come and help the , were killed, and no count was kept of the  slain.\n\n was a servant of  and had been left in charge of ; it was he who was banished from  and settled in  of , and who set up those many statues at .\n\n\nIn relating the matter of the  and , however, I digress from the main thread of my history. The  say that when  was left desolate, it was populated especially by , among other peoples. Then, in the third generation after , the events surrounding the Trojan War, in which the  bore themselves as bravely as any in the cause of , took place.\nAfter this, when they returned from , they and their flocks and herds were afflicted by famine and pestilence, until  was once more left desolate. Then came a third influx of , and it is they who, with those that were left, now dwell there. It was this that the priestess bade them remember, and so prevented them from aiding the  as they were previously inclined.\n\n\nThe  had at first sided with the , not willingly but of necessity. This their acts revealed, because they disliked the plans of the ; as soon as they heard that the  was about to cross over into , they sent messengers to the Isthmus, where men chosen from the cities which were best disposed towards  were assembled in council for the  cause.\nTo these the  messengers came and said, Men of , the pass of  must be guarded so that  and all  may be sheltered from the war. Now we are ready to guard it with you, but you too must send a great force. If you will not send it, be assured that we will make terms with the , for it is not right that we should be left to stand guard alone and so perish for your sakes.\nIf you will not send help, there is nothing you can do to constrain us, for no necessity can prevail over lack of ability. As for us, we will attempt to find some means of deliverance for ourselves. These are the words of the men of .\n\n\nThereupon the  resolved that they would send a land army to  by sea to guard the pass. When the forces had assembled, they passed through the  and came to  in , where they disembarked and took the road for , leaving their ships where they were. They then came to the pass of , which runs from the lower  into  along the river , between the mountains  and .\nThere the  were encamped, about ten thousand men-at-arms altogether, and the cavalry was there as well. The general of the  was  son of , chosen from among the , yet not of the royal house, and  son of  was the general of the .\nThey remained there for only a few days, for messengers came from  son of , the . These, pointing out the size of the army and the great number of ships, advised them to depart and not remain there to be trodden under foot by the invading host. When they had received this advice from the messengers (as they thought their advice was sound and that the  meant well by them), the  followed their counsel.\nTo my thinking, however, what persuaded them was fear, since they had found out that there was another pass leading into  by the hill country of  through the country of the , near the town of ; this was indeed the way by which ' army descended on . The  accordingly went down to their ships and made their way back to the Isthmus.\n\n\nThis was the course of their expedition into , while the king was planning to cross into  from  and was already at . The , now bereft of their allies, sided with the  wholeheartedly and unequivocally. As a result of this they, in their acts, proved themselves to be most useful to the king.\n\n\nWhen they had come to the Isthmus, the , taking into account what was said by , deliberated as a body how and where they should stand to fight. It was decided that they should guard the pass of , for they saw that it was narrower than the pass into  and nearer home.\nThe pass, then, which brought about the fall of those  who fell at , was unknown to them until they came to  and learned of it from the men of . This pass they were resolved to guard and so stay the barbarian's passage into , while their fleet should sail to  in the territory of . These places are near to each other, and each force could therefore be informed of the other's doings. As for the places themselves, their nature is as follows.\n\n\n is where the wide  contracts until the passage between the island of  and the mainland of  is but narrow. This strait leads next to , which is a beach on the coast of , on which stands a temple of .\nThe pass through  into  is fifty feet wide at its narrowest point. It is not here, however, but elsewhere that the way is narrowest, namely, in front of  and behind it; at , which lies behind, it is only the breadth of a cart-way, and it is the same at the Phoenix stream, near the town of .\nTo the west of  rises a high mountain, inaccessible and precipitous, a spur of ; to the east of the road there is nothing but marshes and sea. In this pass are warm springs for bathing, called the Basins by the people of the country, and an altar of  stands nearby. Across this entry a wall had been built, and formerly there was a gate in it.\nIt was the  who built it for fear of the  when these came from  to dwell in the  land, the region which they now possess. Since the  were trying to subdue them, the  made this their protection, and in their search for every means to keep the  from invading their country, they then turned the stream from the hot springs into the pass, so that it might be a watercourse.\nThe ancient wall had been built long ago and most of it lay in ruins; those who built it up again thought that they would in this way bar the foreigner's way into . Very near the road is a village called , and it is from here that the  expected to obtain provisions.\n\n\nThese places, then, were thought by the  to suit their purpose. After making a thorough survey, they concluded that the barbarians could not make use of their entire army, nor of their horsemen. They therefore resolved, that they would meet the invader of  here. Then, when they heard that the  was in , they broke up from the Isthmus and set out with their army to  and with their fleet to .\n\n\nSo with all speed the  went their several ways to meet the enemy. In the meantime, the , who were afraid for themselves and for , consulted the god. They were advised to pray to the winds, for these would be potent allies for .\nWhen they had received the oracle, the  first sent word of it to those  who desired to be free; because of their dread of the barbarian, they were forever grateful. Subsequently they erected an altar to the winds at , the present location of the precinct of  the daughter of , and they offered sacrifices to them. This, then, is the reason why the  to this day offer the winds sacrifice of propitiation.\n\n\n' fleet, however, set forth from the city of , and the ten swiftest of the ships laid their course straight for , where there lay an advance guard of three  ships, a , an , and an Attic. These, when they sighted the foreigners ships, took to flight.\n\n\nThe ship of , of which  was captain, was pursued and straightway captured by the foreigners, who brought the best of its fighting men and cut his throat on the ship's prow, thinking that the sacrifice of the foremost and fairest of their  captives would be auspicious. The name of the sacrificed man was , and it was perhaps his name that he had to thank for it.\n\n\nThe  trireme, of which  was captain, did however give them some trouble. On board this ship was  son of , who acted heroically on that day. When his ship had been taken, he would not stop fighting until he had been entirely hacked to mincemeat.\nWhen he finally did fall, he still had life in him, and the  soldiers on the ships took great pains to keep him alive for his valor, tending his wounds with ointments and wrapping him in bandages of linen cloth.\nUpon returning to their own station, they showed him to the whole host, and made much of him and treated him with kindness. The rest of those whom they took in that ship, however, they used as slaves.\n\n\nTwo of the ships, then, were made captive, and the third trireme, of which  an  was captain, ran aground in her flight at the mouth of the ; the barbarians took her hull but not the crew, for the , as soon as they had run their craft aground, leapt out and made their way through  to .\n\n\nThe  who were stationed at  were informed of these matters by beacons from . They were frightened by this and accordingly changed their anchorage from  to , proposing to guard the  and leaving watchmen on the heights of .\nThree of the ten barbarian ships ran aground on the reef called the Ant, which lies between  and . The barbarians then brought a pillar of stone and set it on the reef, and when their course was plain before them, the whole fleet set forth and sailed from , eleven days after the king had marched from there.\nIt was  of  who showed them where in the strait the reef lay. After sailing along all day, the foreign fleet reached  in  and the beach between the town of  and the  headland.\n\n\nUntil the whole host reached this place and  it suffered no hurt, and calculation proves to me that its numbers were still such as I will now show. The ships from  were twelve hundred and seven in number, and including the entire host of nations involved, there were a total of two hundred and forty-one thousand and four hundred men, two hundred being reckoned for each ship.\n\nOn board all these ships were thirty fighting men of the  and  and  in addition to the company which each had of native fighters; the number of this added contingent is thirty-six thousand, two hundred and ten.\nTo this and to the first number I add the crews of the ships of fifty oars, calculating eighty men for each, whether there were actually more or fewer. Now seeing that, as has already been said, three thousand of these vessels were assembled, the number of men in them must have been two hundred and forty thousand.\nThese, then, were the ships' companies from , and the total number of them was five hundred and seventeen thousand, six hundred and ten. There were seven hundred thousand and one hundred footsoldiers and eighty thousand cavalrymen; to these I add the  camel-riders and  charioteers, estimating them to have been twenty thousand in number.\nThe forces of sea and land added together would consist of two million, three hundred and seventeen thousand, six hundred and ten men. So far I have spoken of the force which came from  itself, without the train of servants which followed it and the companies of the grain-bearing craft.\n\n\nI must, however, also take into account the force brought from , and I will rely on my best judgment in doing so. The  of  and the islands off  furnished one hundred and twenty ships, and the companies of these ships must then have consisted of twenty-four thousand men.\nAs regards the land army supplied by all the nations, , , , , , , , , , , , , dwellers on the coast of of all these I suppose the number to have been three hundred thousand.\nWhen these numbers are added to the numbers from , the sum total of fighting men is two million, six hundred and forty-one thousand, six hundred and ten.\n\n\nThis then is the number of soldiers. As for the service-train which followed them and the crews of the light corn-bearing vessels and all the other vessels besides which came by sea with the force, these I believe to have been not fewer but more than the fighting men.\nSuppose, however, that they were equal in number, neither more nor fewer. If they were equal to the fighting contingent, they made up as many tens of thousands as the others. The number, then, of those whom  son of  led as far as the  headland and  was five million, two hundred and eighty-three thousand, two hundred and twenty.\n\n\nThat is the number of ' whole force. No one, however, can say what the exact number of cooking women, and concubines, and eunuchs was, nor can one determine the number of the beasts of draught and burden, and the  dogs which accompanied the host; so many of them were there. It is accordingly not surprising to me that some of the streams of water ran dry. I do, however, wonder how there were provisions sufficient for so many tens of thousands,\n\nfor calculation shows me, that if each man received one choenix of wheat a day and no more, eleven hundred thousand and three hundred and forty bushels would be required every day. In this calculation I take no account of the provisions for the women, eunuchs, beasts of burden and dogs. Of all those tens of thousands of men, there was not one, as regards looks and grandeur, worthier than  himself to hold that command.\n\n\nThe  fleet put to sea and reached the beach of the  land, between the city of  and the headland of Sepia. The first ships to arrive moored close to land, with the others after them at anchor; since the beach was not large, they lay at anchor in rows eight ships deep out into the sea.\nThey spent the night in this way, but at dawn a storm descended upon them out of a clear and windless sky, and the sea began to boil. A strong east wind blew, which the people living in those parts call .\nThose who felt the wind rising or had proper mooring dragged their ships up on shore ahead of the storm and so survived with their ships. The wind did, however, carry those ships caught out in the open sea against the rocks called the Ovens at  or onto the beach. Some ships were wrecked on the  headland, others were cast ashore at the city of  or at . The storm was indeed unbearable.\n\n\nThe story is told that because of an oracle the  invoked , the north wind, to help them, since another oracle told them to summon their son-in-law as an ally. According to the  story,  had an Attic wife, , the daughter of , ancient king of .\nBecause of this connection, so the tale goes, the  considered  to be their son-in-law. They were stationed off  in , and when they saw the storm rising, they then, if they had not already, sacrificed to and called upon  and  to help them by destroying the barbarian fleet, just as before at .\nI cannot say whether this was the cause of  falling upon the barbarians as they lay at anchor, but the  say that he had come to their aid before and that he was the agent this time. When they went home, they founded a sacred precinct of  beside the .\n\n\nThey say that at the very least no fewer than 400 ships were destroyed in this labor, along with innumerable men and abundant wealth. This shipwreck proved useful to  son of , a man of  who owned land around , for he later picked up many gold and silver cups cast up on shore, found the  treasures, and acquired other untold riches. Although he became very rich from his findings, he did not enjoy luck in everything, for he suffered greatly when his son was murdered.\n\n\nThere was no counting how many grain-ships and other vessels were destroyed. The generals of the fleet were afraid that the  might attack them now that they had been defeated, so they built a high palisade out of the wreckage.\nThe storm lasted three days. Finally the  made offerings and cast spells upon the wind, sacrificing also to  and the . In this way they made the wind stop on the fourth dayor perhaps it died down on its own. They sacrificed to  after hearing from the  the story that it was from this place that  had carried her off and that all the headland of Sepia belonged to her and to the other .\n\n\nThe storm, then, ceased on the fourth day. Now the scouts stationed on the headlands of  ran down and told the  all about the shipwreck on the second day after the storm began.\nAfter hearing this they prayed to  as their savior and poured libations. Then they hurried to  hoping to find few ships opposing them. So they came to  a second time and made their station there. From that time on they call  their savior.\n\n\nThe barbarians, when the wind ceased and the waves no longer ran high, put to sea and coasted along the mainland; they sailed around the headland of  and sailed straight into the gulf which stretches toward .\nThere is a place on this gulf in , where, it is said,  was sent for water and was left behind by  and his comrades of the , when they were sailing to  in  for the fleece; their purpose was to draw water from there and then to put out to sea. This is the reason why that place has been called . Here ' men made their anchorage.\n\n\nFifteen of those ships had put to sea a long time after all the rest, and it chanced that they sighted the  ships off . Supposing these to be their own fleet, the barbarians proceeded into the midst of their enemies. Their captain was the viceroy from  in ,  son of . This man, who was one of the king's judges, had once before been taken and crucified by  because he had given unjust judgment for a bribe.\nWhen  had been hung on the cross,  found on consideration that his good services to the royal house outweighed his offenses. The king then perceived that he had acted with more haste than wisdom and set  free.\nIn this way he escaped from being put to death by . Now that he was taken into the midst of the , however, he was not to escape a second time, for when the  saw the  bearing down on them, they perceived their mistake and putting to sea, easily took them captive.\n\n\nIn one of these ships they took , the tyrant of  in , and in another the  captain , son of Demonous; of the twelve ships which he had brought from  he had lost eleven in the storm off the  headland and was in the one which remained when he was taken as he headed down on . Having questioned these men and learned what they desired to know of ' force, the  sent them away to the isthmus of  in bonds.\n\n\nSo the foreign fleet, of which, with the exception of fifteen ships  was captain, came to .  and his land army marched through  and , and it was three days since he had entered . In  he held a race for his own cavalry; this was also a test of the  horsemen, whom he had heard were the best in . The  horses were far outpaced in this contest. Of the  rivers, the  was the only one which could not provide enough water for his army to drink. In , however, even the greatest river there, the , gave out, remaining but a sorry trickle.\n\n\nWhen  had come to  in , his guides, desiring to inform him of all they knew, told him the story which is related in that country concerning the worship of , namely how  son of  plotted ' death with , and further, how the  by an oracle's bidding compel  descendants to certain tasks.\nThey order the eldest of that family not to enter their town-hall (which the  call the ) and themselves keep watch there. If he should enter, he may not come out, save only to be sacrificed. They say as well that many of those who were to be sacrificed had fled in fear to another country, and that if they returned at a later day and were taken, they were brought into the town-hall. The guides showed  how the man is sacrificed, namely with fillets covering him all over and a procession to lead him forth.\nIt is the descendants of ' son  who are treated in this way, because when the  by an oracle's bidding made  son of  a scapegoat for their country and were about to sacrifice him, this  came from  in  and delivered him, thereby bringing the god's wrath on his own descendants.\nHearing all this, , when he came to the temple grove, refrained from entering it himself and bade all his army do likewise, holding the house and the precinct of ' descendants alike in reverence.\n\n\nThese were ' actions in  and . From here he came into  along a gulf of the sea, in which the tide ebbs and flows daily. There is low-lying ground about this gulf, sometimes wide and sometimes very narrow, and around it stand high and inaccessible mountains which enclose the whole of  and are called the Rocks of .\nNow the first town by the gulf on the way from  is , near to which the river  flows from the country of the  and issues into the sea. About twenty furlongs from that river is another named , which is said to have risen from the ground to aid  against the fire that consumed him and twenty furlongs again from that there is another river called the .\n\n\nThe town of  is five furlongs away from this . Here is the greatest distance in all this region between the sea and the hills on which  stands, for the plain is twenty-two thousand plethra in extent. In the mountains which hem in the  land there is a ravine to the south of , through which the river  flows past the lower slopes of the mountains.\n\n\nThere is another river south of the , the , a little stream which flows from those mountains into the . Near this stream is the narrowest place; there is only space for a single cart-way.  is fifteen furlongs away from the river Phoenix.\nBetween the river and  there is a village named , past which the  flows out into the sea, and there is a wide space around it in which stand a temple of , seats for the , and a temple of  himself\n\n\n lay encamped in  in  and the  in the pass. This place is called  by most of the , but by the natives and their neighbors . Each lay encamped in these places.  was master of everything to the north from , and the  of all that lay toward the south on the mainland.\n\n\nThe  who awaited the  in that place were these: three hundred  armed men; one thousand from  and , half from each place; one hundred and twenty from  in  and one thousand from the rest of ; that many , four hundred from , two hundred from , and eighty . These were the  present; from  there were seven hundred  and four hundred .\n\n\nIn addition, the  in full force and one thousand  came at the summons. The  had called upon them through messengers who told them that this was only the advance guard, that the rest of the allies were expected any day now, and that the sea was being watched, with the  and  and all those enrolled in the fleet on guard. There was nothing for them to be afraid of.\nThe invader of  was not a god but a human being, and there was not, and never would be, any mortal on whom some amount of evil was not bestowed at birth, with the greatest men receiving the largest share. The one marching against them was certain to fall from pride, since he was a mortal. When they heard this, the  and  marched to  to help.\n\n\nEach city had its own general, but the one most admired and the leader of the whole army was a , , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of , son of .  had gained the kingship at  unexpectedly.\n\n\nSince he had two older brothers,  and , he had renounced all thought of the kingship. , however, died without male offspring, and , who had met his end in , was also no longer alive. The succession therefore fell to  since he was older than ' youngest son  and had married ' daughter.\nHe now came to  with the appointed three hundred he had selected, all of whom had sons. He also brought those  whom I counted among the number and whose general was  son of .\n\n took pains to bring only the  among the , because they were accused of medizing; he summoned them to the war wishing to know whether they would send their men with him or openly refuse the  alliance. They sent the men but intended something quite different\n\n\nThe  sent the men with  on ahead so that the rest of the allies would see them and march, instead of medizing like the others if they learned that the  were delaying. At present the  was in their way, but once they had completed the festival, they intended to leave a garrison at  and march out in full force with all speed.\nThe rest of the allies planned to do likewise, for the  coincided with these events. They accordingly sent their advance guard, not expecting the war at  to be decided so quickly.\n\n\nThis is what they intended, but the  at , when the  drew near the pass, fearfully took counsel whether to depart. The rest of the  were for returning to the  and guarding the isthmus, but the  and  were greatly angered by this counsel.  voted to remain where they were and send messengers to the cities bidding them to send help, since they were too few to ward off the army of the .\n\n\nWhile they debated in this way,  sent a mounted scout to see how many there were and what they were doing. While he was still in , he had heard that a small army was gathered there and that its leaders were , including , who was of the  clan.\nRiding up to the camp, the horseman watched and spied out the place. He could, however, not see the whole camp, for it was impossible to see those posted inside the wall which they had rebuilt and were guarding. He did take note of those outside, whose arms lay in front of the wall, and it chanced that at that time the  were posted there.\nHe saw some of the men exercising naked and others combing their hair. He marvelled at the sight and took note of their numbers. When he had observed it all carefully, he rode back in leisure, since no one pursued him or paid him any attention at all. So he returned and told  all that he had seen.\n\n\nWhen  heard that, he could not comprehend the fact that the  were actually, to the best of their ability, preparing to kill or be killed. What they did appeared laughable to him, so he sent for  the son of , who was in his camp.\nWhen this man arrived, he asked him about each of these matters, wanting to understand what it was that the  were doing.  said, You have already heard about these men from me, when we were setting out for , but when you heard, you mocked me, although I told you how I expected things to turn out. It is my greatest aim, O King, to be truthful in your presence.\nSo hear me now. These men have come to fight us for the pass, and it for this that they are preparing. This is their custom: when they are about to risk their lives, they arrange their hair.\nRest assured that if you overcome these men and those remaining behind at , there is no one else on earth who will raise his hands to withstand you, my King. You are now attacking the fairest kingdom in  and men who are the very best.\nWhat he said seemed completely incredible to , so he then asked how they, who were so few in number, would fight against his army.  answered, My King, take me for a liar if this does not turn out as I say. So he spoke, but he did not persuade .\n\n\nHe let four days go by, expecting them to run away at any minute. They did not leave, and it seemed to him that they stayed out of folly and lack of due respect. On the fifth day he became angry and sent the  and  against them, bidding them take them prisoner and bring them into his presence.\nThe  bore down upon the  and attacked. Many fell, but others attacked in turn, and they made it clear to everyone, especially to the king himself, that among so many people there were few real men. The battle lasted all day.\n\n\nWhen the  had been roughly handled, they retired, and the  whom the king called Immortals, led by , attacked in turn. It was thought that they would easily accomplish the task.\nWhen they joined battle with the , they fared neither better nor worse than the Median army, since they used shorter spears than the  and could not use their numbers fighting in a narrow space.\nThe  fought memorably, showing themselves skilled fighters amidst unskilled on many occasions, as when they would turn their backs and feign flight. The barbarians would see them fleeing and give chase with shouting and noise, but when the  were overtaken, they would turn to face the barbarians and overthrow innumerable . A few of the  themselves were also slain. When the  could gain no inch of the pass, attacking by companies and in every other fashion, they withdrew.\n\n\nIt is said that during these assaults in the battle the king, as he watched, jumped up three times from the throne in fear for his army. This, then, is how the fighting progressed, and on the next day the barbarians fought no better. They joined battle supposing that their enemies, being so few, were now disabled by wounds and could no longer resist.\nThe , however, stood ordered in ranks by nation, and each of them fought in turn, except the , who were posted on the mountain to guard the path. When the  found nothing different from what they saw the day before, they withdrew.\n\n\nThe king was at a loss as to how to deal with the present difficulty.  son of , a , thinking he would get a great reward from the king, came to speak with him and told him of the path leading over the mountain to . In so doing he caused the destruction of the  remaining there.\nLater he fled into  in fear of the , and while he was in exile, a price was put on his head by the  when the  assembled at . Still later he returned from exile to  and was killed by , a .\n\n slew  for a different reason, which I will tell later in my history, but he was given no less honor by the . It was in this way, then, that  was later killed.\n\n\nThere is another story told, namely that  son of , a , and  of  are the ones who gave the king this information and guided the  around the mountain, but I find it totally incredible.\nOne must judge by the fact that the  set a price not on  and  but on  the , and I suppose they had exact knowledge; furthermore, we know that  was banished on this charge.\n\n might have known the path, although he was not a , if he had often come to that country, but  was the one who guided them along the path around the mountain. It is he whom I put on record as guilty.\n\n\n was pleased by what  promised to accomplish. He immediately became overjoyed and sent out  and the men under  command, who set forth from the camp at about lamp-lighting time. This path had been discovered by the native , who used it to guide the  into  when the  had fenced off the pass with a wall and were sheltered from the war. So long ago the  had discovered that the pass was in no way a good thing.\n\n\nThe course of the path is as follows: it begins at the river  as it flows through the ravine, and this mountain and the path have the same name, . This  stretches along the ridge of the mountain and ends at , the  city nearest to , near the rock called  and the seats of the , where it is narrowest.\n\n\nThis, then, was the nature of the pass. The  crossed the  and travelled all night along this path, with the  on their right and the  on their left. At dawn they came to the summit of the pass.\n\n In this part of the mountain one thousand armed men of the  were on watch, as I have already shown, defending their own country and guarding the path. The lower pass was held by those I have mentioned, but the  had voluntarily promised  to guard the path over the mountain.\n\n\nThe  learned in the following way that the  had climbed up: they had ascended without the ' notice because the mountain was entirely covered with oak trees. Although there was no wind, a great noise arose like leaves being trodden underfoot. The  jumped up and began to put on their weapons, and in a moment the barbarians were there.\nWhen they saw the men arming themselves, they were amazed, for they had supposed that no opposition would appear, but they had now met with an army.  feared that the  might be  and asked  what country the army was from. When he had established what he wanted to know with certainty, he arrayed the  for battle.\nThe , assailed by thick showers of arrows and supposing that the  had set out against them from the start, fled to the top of the mountain and prepared to meet their destruction. This is what they intended, but the  with  and  paid no attention to the  and went down the mountain as fast as possible.\n\n\nThe seer , examining the sacrifices, first told the  at  that death was coming to them with the dawn. Then deserters came who announced the circuit made by the . These gave their signals while it was still night; a third report came from the watchers running down from the heights at dawn.\nThe  then took counsel, but their opinions were divided. Some advised not to leave their post, but others spoke against them. They eventually parted, some departing and dispersing each to their own cities, others preparing to remain there with .\n\n\nIt is said that  himself sent them away because he was concerned that they would be killed, but felt it not fitting for himself and the  to desert that post which they had come to defend at the beginning.\nI, however, tend to believe that when  perceived that the allies were dispirited and unwilling to run all risks with him, he told then to depart. For himself, however, it was not good to leave; if he remained, he would leave a name of great fame, and the prosperity of  would not be blotted out.\nWhen the  asked the oracle about this war when it broke out, the  had foretold that either  would be destroyed by the barbarians or their king would be killed. She gave them this answer in hexameter verses running as follows:\n\n\n\nConsidering this and wishing to win distinction for the  alone, he sent away the allies rather than have them leave in disorder because of a difference of opinion.\n\n\nNot the least proof I have of this is the fact that  publicly dismissed the seer who attended the expedition, for fear that he might die with them. This was  the , said to be descended from , the one who told from the sacrifices what was going to happen to them. He was dismissed but did not leave; instead he sent away his only son who was also with the army.\n\n\nThose allies who were dismissed went off in obedience to , only the  and  remaining with the . The  remained against their will and desire, for  kept them as hostages. The  very gladly remained, saying they would not abandon  and those with him by leaving; instead they would stay and die with them. Their general was  son of .\n\n\n made libations at sunrise and waiting till about mid-morning, made his assault.  had advised this, for the descent from the mountain is more direct, and the way is much shorter than the circuit and ascent.\n\n and his barbarians attacked, but  and his , knowing they were going to their deaths, advanced now much farther than before into the wider part of the pass. In all the previous days they had sallied out into the narrow way and fought there, guarding the defensive wall.\nNow, however, they joined battle outside the narrows and many of the barbarians fell, for the leaders of the companies beat everyone with whips from behind, urging them ever forward. Many of them were pushed into the sea and drowned; far more were trampled alive by each other, with no regard for who perished.\nSince the  knew that they must die at the hands of those who had come around the mountain, they displayed the greatest strength they had against the barbarians, fighting recklessly and desperately.\n\n\nBy this time most of them had had their spears broken and were killing the  with swords. , proving himself extremely valiant, fell in that struggle and with him other famous , whose names I have learned by inquiry since they were worthy men. Indeed, I have learned by inquiry the names of all three hundred.\nMany famous  also fell there, including two sons of ,  and , born to  by  daughter of .  was the brother of king  and son of  son of . When he gave his daughter in marriage to , he gave his whole house as dowry, since she was his only child.\n\n\nTwo brothers of  accordingly fought and fell there. There was a great struggle between the  and  over ' body, until the  by their courageous prowess dragged it away and routed their enemies four times. The battle went on until the men with  arrived.\nWhen the  saw that they had come, the contest turned, for they retired to the narrow part of the way, passed behind the wall, and took their position crowded together on the hill, all except the . This hill is at the mouth of the pass, where the stone lion in honor of  now stands.\nIn that place they defended themselves with swords, if they still had them, and with hands and teeth. The barbarians buried them with missiles, some attacking from the front and throwing down the defensive wall, others surrounding them on all sides.\n\n\nThis then is how the  and  conducted themselves, but the   is said to have exhibited the greatest courage of all. They say that he made the following speech before they joined battle with the : he had learned from a  that there were so many of the barbarians that when they shot their missiles, the sun was hidden by the multitude of their arrows.\nHe was not at all disturbed by this and made light of the multitude of the , saying that their  foreigner brought them good news. If the  hid the sun, they could fight them in the shade instead of in the sun. This saying and others like it, they claim,  the  left behind as a memorial.\n\n\nNext after him two  brothers,  and , sons of , are said to have been most courageous. The  who gained most renown was one whose name was  son of .\n\n\nThere is an inscription written over these men, who were buried where they fell, and over those who died before the others went away, dismissed by . It reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThat inscription is for them all, but the  have their own: \n\n\n\n\nThat one is to the , this one to the seer: \n\n\n\n\nExcept for the seer's inscription, the  are the ones who honored them by erecting inscriptions and pillars. That of the seer  was inscribed by  son of  because of his tie of guest-friendship with the man.\n\n\nIt is said that two of these three hundred,  and , could have agreed with each other either to come home safely together to , since  had dismissed them from the camp and they were lying at  very sick of ophthalmia, or to die with the others, if they were unwilling to return home. They could have done either of these things, but they could not agree and had different intentions. When  learned of the  circuit, he demanded his armor and put it on, bidding his helot to lead him to the fighting. The helot led him there and fled, but he rushed into the fray and was killed. , however, lost his strength and stayed behind.\nNow if  alone had been sick and returned to , or if they had both made the trip, I think the  would not have been angry with them. When, however, one of them died, and the other had the same excuse but was unwilling to die, the  had no choice but to display great anger towards .\n\n\nSome say that  came home safely to  in this way and by this excuse. Others say that he had been sent out of the camp as a messenger and could have gotten back in time for the battle but chose not to, staying behind on the road and so surviving, while his fellow-messenger arrived at the battle and was killed.\n\n\nWhen  returned to , he was disgraced and without honor. He was deprived of his honor in this way: no  would give him fire or speak with him, and they taunted him by calling him . In the battle at , however, he made up for all the blame brought against him.\n\n\nIt is said that another of the three hundred survived because he was sent as a messenger to . His name was . When he returned to , he was dishonored and hanged himself.\n\n\nThe , whose general was , fought against the king's army as long as they were with the  and under compulsion. When, however, they saw the  side prevailing and the  with  hurrying toward the hill, they split off and approached the barbarians, holding out their hands. With the most truthful words ever spoken, they explained that they were Medizers, had been among the first to give earth and water to the king, had come to  under constraint, and were guiltless of the harm done to the king.\nBy this plea they saved their lives, and the  bore witness to their words. They were not, however, completely lucky. When the barbarians took hold of them as they approached, they killed some of them even as they drew near. Most of them were branded by  command with the kings marks, starting with the general . His son  long afterwards was murdered by the  when, as general of four hundred , he seized the town of .\n\n\nThis, then, is how the  fought at .  then sent for  and questioned him, saying first,  you are a good man. I hold that proven by the plain truth, for things have turned out no differently than you foretold. Now, tell me this: how many  are left, and how many of them are warriors like these? or is it so with them all?\n\nMy king, said , the number of the  is great, and so too the number of their cities. But what you would like to know, I will tell you: there is in  a city called , a city of about eight thousand men, all of them equal to those who have fought here; the rest of the  are not equal to these, yet they are valiant men.\n\nAnd how, , answered , can we overcome those men with the least trouble to ourselves? Come, disclose that to me, for you have been their king and know the plan and order of their counsels.\n\n\nMy king,  replied, if you in sincerity ask my counsel, it is but right that I should point out to you the best way. It is this, namely that you should send three hundred ships of your fleet to the  land.\nThere is an island lying off their coasts called . , a man of much wisdom among us, says about it that it would be better for the  if  were beneath the sea rather than above it. This he said because he expected that it would provide an opportunity for attack just as I am suggestingnot that he had any foreknowledge of your force, but he dreaded all men's forces alike.\nLet them then make that island their station and set out from there to strike fear into the . If these have a war of their own on their borders, you will have no cause to fear that they will send men to save the rest of  from being overrun by your armies; furthermore, the enslavement of the rest of  must weaken  if it is left to stand alone.\nIf, however, you do not do this, then expect what I will now tell you: a narrow isthmus leads to the ; all the  will be banded together there against you, and you may expect battles more stubborn than those that you have fought already. But if you do as I have said, then you may have that isthmus and all their cities without striking a blow.\n\n\nNext spoke , ' brother and admiral of the fleet; it chanced that he was present during their conversation, and he feared that  would be persuaded to follow ' counsel. O king, he said, I see that you are listening to a man who is jealous of your good fortune or is perhaps even a traitor to your cause. These are the ways that are dear to the hearts of all : they are jealous of success and they hate power.\nNo, if after the recent calamity which has wrecked four hundred of your ships you send away three hundred more from your fleet to sail round the , your enemies will be enough to do battle with you; while your fleet is united, however, it is invincible, and your enemies will not be so many as to be enough to fight; moreover, all your navy will be a help to your army and your army to your navy, both moving together. If you separate some of your fleet from yourself, you will be of no use to them, nor they to you.\nMy counsel is rather that you make your own plans well, and take no account of the business of your adversaries, what battlefields they will choose, what they will do, and how many they are. They are able enough to think for themselves, and we similarly for ourselves. As for the , if they meet the  in the field, they will in no way repair their most recent losses.\n\n\n,  answered, I think that you speak well, and I will do as you counsel. Despite the fact that your advice is better than his,  does say what he supposes to be most serviceable to me,\n\nfor assuredly I will never believe that he is no friend to my cause. I believe this of him because of all that he has already said and by what is the truth, namely, that if one citizen prospers, another citizen is jealous of him and shows his enmity by silence, and no one, (except if he has attained the height of excellence; and such are seldom seen) if his own townsman asks for counsel, will give him what he thinks to be the best advice.\nIf one stranger prospers, however, another stranger is beyond all men his well-wisher and will, if he is asked, impart to him the best counsel he has. It is for this reason that I bid you all to refrain from maligning , seeing that he is a stranger and a friend.\n\n\nHaving spoken in this way,  passed over the place where the dead lay and hearing that  had been king and general of the , he gave orders to cut off his head and impale it.\nIt is plain to me by this piece of evidence among many others, that while  lived, king  was more incensed against him than against all others; otherwise he would never have dealt so outrageously with his dead body, for the  are beyond all men known in the habit of honoring valiant warriors. They, then, who received these orders did as I have said.\n\n\nI return now to that place in my history where it earlier left off. The  were the first to be informed that the king was equipping himself to attack ; with this knowledge it was that they sent to the oracle at , where they received the answer about which I spoke a little while ago. Now the way in which they were informed of this was strange.\n\n son of , an exile among the , was, as I suppose (reason being also my ally), no friend to the , and I leave it to be imagined whether what he did was done out of goodwill or spiteful triumph. When  was resolved to march against , , who was then at  and had knowledge of this, desired to send word of it to the .\nHe, however, feared detection and had no other way of informing them than this trick:taking a double tablet, he scraped away the wax from it, and then wrote the king's plan on the wood. Next he melted the wax back again over the writing, so that the bearer of this seemingly blank tablet might not be troubled by the way-wardens.\nWhen the tablet came to , the  could not guess its meaning, until at last (as I have been told) , ' daughter and ' wife, discovered the trick herself and advised them to scrape the wax away so that they would find writing on the wood. When they did so, they found and read the message, and presently sent it to the rest of the .

The  furnished forty ships and the  twenty;\n\nthe  manned twenty, the  furnishing the ships; the  eighteen, the  twelve, the  ten, the  eight, the  seven, the  five, the  two, and the  two, and two fifty-oared barks; the  brought seven fifty-oared barks to their aid.\n\n\nThese are the forces which came to  for battle, and I have now shown how they individually furnished the whole sum. The number of ships mustered at  was two hundred and seventy-one, besides the fifty-oared barks.\nThe , however, provided the admiral who had the chief command, , son of , for the allies said that if the  were not their leader, they would rather make an end of the fleet that was assembling than be led by the .\n\n\nIn the first days, before the sending to  for alliance, there had been talk of entrusting the command at sea to the . However, when the allies resisted, the  waived their claim, considering the safety of  of prime importance and seeing that if they quarrelled over the leadership,  must perish. In this they judged rightly, for civil strife is as much worse than united war as war is worse than peace.\nKnowing that, they gave ground and waived their claim, but only so long as they had great need of the others. This is clear, for when they had driven the  back and the battle was no longer for their territory but for his, they made a pretext of ' highhandedness and took the command away from the . All that, however, took place later.\n\n\nBut now, the  who had at last come to  saw a multitude of ships launched at  and forces everywhere, and contrary to all expectation, the barbarian was shown to be in much different shape than they had supposed. They accordingly lost heart and began to deliberate about flight from  homewards into .\nThen the , noticing that they were making such plans, entreated  to wait a little while, till they themselves had removed their children and households. When they could not prevail with him, they tried another way and gave , the  admiral, a bribe of thirty talents on the condition that the  fleet should remain there and fight, when they fought, to defend .\n\n\nThis was the way in which  made the  stay where they were: he gave  for his share five talents of that money, as though he were making the present of his own money. When  had been won over in this way, none of the rest was inclined to resist save , son of , the  admiral, who said that he would not remain but sail away from ; to him , adding an oath, said:\n\nNo, you of all men will not desert us, for I will give you a greater gift than the king of the  would send you for deserting your allies. With that he sent three talents of silver to  ship.\nThese two, then, were won over by gifts, the  got what they wanted, and  himself was the gainer. No one knew that he had kept the rest of the money, and those who had received a part of it supposed that it had been sent for that purpose by the .\n\n\nSo the  remained in  and fought there; this came about as I will now reveal. Having arrived at  in the early part of the afternoon, the barbarians saw for themselves the few  ships that they had already heard were stationed off , and they were eager to attack so that they might take them.\nThey were not prepared to make a head-on attack since they feared that the  would see them coming and turn to flee with night close upon them as they fled; it was their belief that the  would save themselves by flight, and they did not want even so much as a firebearer to be saved.\n\n\nTaking these things into consideration, they devised the following plan; separating two hundred ships from the whole number, they sent them to cruise outside  so that the enemies might not see them sailing round  and by way of  round  to the  so that they might catch the  between them, the one part holding that course and barring the retreat, and they themselves attacking in front.\nUpon making these plans they sent the appointed ships on their way, intending not to make an attack upon the  either on that day or before the signal should be seen, whereby the ships that sailed round were to declare their coming. So they sent those ships to sail round, and set about counting the rest at .\n\n\nNow when they were engaged in this count, there was in the fleet one , a man of ; he was the best diver of the time, and in the shipwreck at  he had saved for the  much of their possessions and gotten much for himself in addition; this  had before now, it would seem, intended to desert to the , but he never had had so fair an occasion as now.\nBy what means he did at last make his way to the , I cannot with exactness say. If the story is true, it is marvellous indeed, for it is said that he dove into the sea at  and never rose to the surface till he came to , thus passing underneath the sea for about eighty furlongs.\nThere are many tales about this man, some similar to lies and some true, but as regards the present business it is my opinion that he came to  in a boat. After arriving, he straightway told the admirals the story of the shipwreck, and of the ships that had been sent round .\n\n\nHearing that, the  took counsel together; there was much talk, but the opinion prevailed that they should remain and encamp where they were for that day, and then, after midnight, to put to sea and meet the ships which were sailing around. Presently, however, meeting with no opposition, they waited for the late afternoon of the day and themselves advanced their ships against the barbarian, desiring to put to the proof his fashion of fighting and the art of breaking the line.\n\n\nWhen ' men and their generals saw the  bearing down on them with but a few ships, they thought that they were definitely mad and put out to sea themselves, thinking that they would win an easy victory; this expectation was very reasonable, since they saw that the  ships so few while their own were many times more numerous and more seaworthy. With this assurance, they hemmed in the  in their midst.\nNow all the  who were friendly to the  came unwillingly to the war and were distressed to see the  surrounded. They supposed that not one of them would return home, so powerless did the  seem to them to be.\nThose who were glad about the business, however, vied each with each that he might be the first to take an Attic ship and receive gifts from the king, for it was the  of whom there was most talk in the fleet.\n\n\nBut the , when the signal was given them, first drew the sterns of their ships together, their prows turned towards the foreigners; then at the second signal they put their hands to the work, despite the fact that they were hemmed in within a narrow space and were fighting face-to-face.\nThere they took thirty of the foreigners ships as well as the brother of  king of ,  son of , a man of note in the fleet. The first  to take an enemy ship was an , , son of , and he it was who received the prize for valor.\nThey fought that sea-fight with doubtful issue, and nightfall ended the battle; the  sailed back to , and the barbarians to , after faring far below their hopes in the fight. In that battle  of , the only one of the  siding with the , deserted to the , and for that the  gave him land in .\n\n\nWhen darkness came on, the season being then midsummer, there was abundance of rain all through the night and violent thunderings from . The dead and the wrecks were driven towards , where they were entangled with the ships' prows and jumbled the blades of the oars.\nThe ships crews who were there were dismayed by the noise of this, and considering their present bad state, expected utter destruction; for before they had recovered from the shipwreck and the storm off , they next endured a stubborn sea-fight, and after the sea-fight, rushing rain and mighty torrents pouring seaward and violent thunderings.\n\n\nThis is how the night dealt with them. To those who were appointed to sail round , however, that same night was still more cruel since it caught them on the open sea. Their end was a terrible one, for when the storm and the rain came on them in their course off the Hollows of , they were driven by the wind in an unknown direction and were driven onto the rocks. All this was done by the god so that the  power might be more equally matched with the , and not much greater than it.\n\n\nThese men, then, perished at the Hollows of . As for the barbarians at , when to their great comfort the day dawned, they kept their ships unmoved, being in their evil plight well content to do nothing for the moment. Now fifty-three Attic ships came to aid the ,\n\nwho were encouraged both by the ships coming and by the news that the barbarians sailing round  had all perished in the recent storm. They waited then for the same hour as before, and fell upon certain  ships when they put to sea. After destroying these when night fell, they sailed back to .\n\n\nOn the third day, however, the barbarian admirals, finding it hard to bear that so few ships should do them hurt and fearing ' anger, waited no longer for the  to begin the fight, but gave the word and put out to sea about midday. So it came to pass that these sea-battles were fought on the same days as the land-battles at ;\n\nthe seamen's whole endeavor was to hold the  while ' men strove to guard the passage; the  were ordered to give the barbarian no entry into , and the  to destroy the  host and win the strait.\n\n\nSo when ' men ordered their battle and advanced, the  remained in their station off , and the barbarians made a half circle of their ships striving to encircle and enclose them. At that the  charged and joined battle. In that sea-fight both had equal success.\n\n' fleet did itself harm by its numbers and size. The ships were thrown into confusion and ran foul of each other; nevertheless they held fast and did not yield, for they could not bear to be put to flight by a few ships.\nMany were the  ships and men that perished there, and far more yet of the foreigners' ships and men; this is how they fought until they drew off and parted from each other.\n\n\nIn that sea-fight of all ' fighters the  conducted themselves with the greatest valor; besides other great feats of arms which they achieved, they took five  ships together with their crews. As regards the , it was the  who bore themselves best on that day, and of the  son of . He brought to the war two hundred men and a ship of his own, all at his own expense.\n\n\nSo they parted, and each hurried gladly to his own place of anchorage. When the  had withdrawn and come out of the battle, they were left in possession of the dead and the wrecks. They had, however, had a rough time of it themselves, chiefly the , half of whose ships had suffered some damage. Now their counsel was to flee to the inner waters of \n\n\n thought that if the  and  nations were removed from the forces of the barbarians, the  might be strong enough to prevail over the rest. Now it was the custom of the  to drive their flocks down to the sea there. Gathering the admirals together, he told them that he thought he had a device whereby he hoped to draw away the best of the king's allies.\nSo much he revealed for the moment, but merely advised them to let everyone slay as many from the  flocks as he wanted; it was better that the fleet should have them, than the enemy. Moreover, he counselled them each to order his men to light a fire; as for the time of their departure from that place, he would see to it that they would return to  unscathed. All this they agreed to do and immediately lit fires and set upon the flocks.\n\n\nNow the  had neglected the oracle of , believing it to be empty of meaning, and neither by carrying away nor by bringing in anything had they shown that they feared an enemy's coming. In so doing they were the cause of their own destruction,\n\nfor ' oracle concerning this matter runs as follows\n\nTo these verses the  gave no heed; but in the evils then present and soon to come they suffered the greatest calamity.\n\n\nWhile the  were doing as I have said, there came to them their lookout from . There was a scout at , one , a native of , who was charged (and had a rowing boat standing ready for it), if the fleet should suffer a reverse to declare it to the men at . Similarly, if any ill should befall the land army,  son of , an , was with , ready for his part to bring the news in a thirty-oared bark to the  at .\nSo this  came and declared to them the fate of  and his army. When the  learned this, they no longer delayed their departure but went their ways in their appointed order, the  first and last of all the .\n\n\n, however, picked out the seaworthiest  ships and made his way to the places where drinking water could be found. Here he engraved on the rocks words which the  read on the next day when they came to . This was what the writing said: Men of , you do wrongly to fight against the land of your fathers and bring slavery upon .\nIt would best for you to join yourselves to us, but if that should be impossible for you, then at least now withdraw from the war, and entreat the  to do the same as you. If neither of these things may be and you are fast bound by such constraint that you cannot rebel, yet we ask you not to use your full strength in the day of battle. Remember that you are our sons and that our quarrel with the barbarian was of your making in the beginning.\nTo my thinking  wrote this with a double intent, namely that if the king knew nothing of the writing, it might induce the  to change sides and join with the , while if the writing were maliciously reported to , he might thereby be led to mistrust the  and keep them out of the sea-fights.\n\n\nSuch was ' writing. Immediately after this there came to the barbarians a man of  in a boat, telling them of the flight of the  from . Not believing this, they kept the bringer of the news in confinement and sent swift ships to spy out the matter. When the crews of these brought word of the truth, the whole armada sailed all together to  at the crack of dawn. Here they waited till midday and then sailed to . Upon their arrival they took possession of the ' city and overran all the villages on the seaboard of the  region, which is a district belonging to .\n\n\nWhile they were there,  sent a herald to the fleet. Before sending him,  had made the following preparations: of all his own soldiers who had fallen at  (that is, as many as twenty thousand) he left about a thousand, and the rest he buried in trenches, which he covered with leaves and heaped earth so that the men of the fleet might not see them.\nWhen the herald had crossed over to , he assembled all the men of the fleet and said: Men of our allies,  permits any one of you who should so desire to leave his place and come to see how he fights against those foolish men who thought they could overcome the king's power.\n\n\nAfter this proclamation, there was nothing so hard to get as a boat, so many were they who wanted to see this. They crossed over and went about viewing the dead. All of them supposed that the fallen  were all  and , though helots were also there for them to see.\nFor all that, however, those who crossed over were not deceived by what  had done with his own dead, for the thing was truly ridiculous; of the  a thousand lay dead before their eyes, but the  lay all together assembled in one place, to the number of four thousand.\nAll that day they spent in observation, and on the next the shipmen returned to their fleet at  while ' army set forth on its march.\n\n\nThere had come to them a few deserters, men of , lacking a livelihood and desirous to find some service. Bringing these men into the king's presence, the  inquired of them what the  were doing, there being one who put this question in the name of all.\nWhen the  told them that the  were holding the  festival and viewing sports and horseraces, the  asked what was the prize offered, for which they contended. They told him of the crown of olive that was given to the victor. Then  son of  uttered a most noble saying (but the king deemed him a coward for it);\n\nwhen he heard that the prize was not money but a crown, he could not hold his peace, but cried, Good heavens, , what kind of men are these that you have pitted us against? It is not for money they contend but for glory of achievement! Such was ' saying.\n\n\nIn the meantime, immediately after the misfortune at , the  sent a herald to the , because they bore an old grudge against them and still more because of their latest disaster.\nNow a few years before the king's expedition, the  and their allies had invaded  with their whole army but had been worsted and roughly handled by the .\nWhen the  were besieged on , they had with them the diviner  of ;  devised a stratagem for them: he covered six hundred of the bravest  with gypsum, themselves and their armor, and led them to attack the  by night, bidding them slay whomever they should see not whitened.\nThe  sentinels were the first to see these men and to flee for fear, supposing falsely that it was something supernatural, and after the sentinels the whole army fled as well. The  made themselves masters of four thousand dead, and their shields, of which they dedicated half at  and the rest at .\nA tithe of what they won in that fight went to the making of the great statues that stand around the tripod in front of the shrine at , and there are others like them dedicated at .\n\n\nThis is what the besieged  did with the  footsoldiers. When the  horsemen rode into their country, the  did them mortal harm; they dug a great pit in the pass near  and put empty jars inside it. They then covered it with earth till all was like the rest of the ground and awaited the onset of the . These rode on intending to sweep the  before them, and fell in among the jars, whereby their horses' legs were broken.\n\n\nThese two deeds had never been forgiven by the , and now they sent a herald with this message: Men of , it is time now that you confess yourselves to be no match for us.\nWe were even formerly preferred to you by the , as long as we were on their side, and now we bear such weight with the foreigner that it lies in our power to have you deprived of your lands and to have you enslaved. Nevertheless, although we could easily do these things, we bear you no ill-will for the past. Pay us fifty talents of silver for what you did, and we promise to turn aside what threatens your land.\n\n\nThis was the ' offer. The  alone of all that region would not take the ' side, and that for no other reason (if I argue correctly) than their hatred of the .\nHad the  aided the  side, then the  would certainly have stood for the . They replied to the offer of the  that they would give no money; they could do as the  did and take the  part, if for any cause they so wished, but they would not willingly betray the cause of .\n\n\nWhen this answer was returned to them, the  in their wrath against the  began to guide the barbarian on his march. From the lands of  they broke into ; there is a narrow tongue of  land stretching that way, about thirty furlongs wide, between the  territory and the , which in old time was . This region is the motherland of the  of the . To this  territory the barbarians did no harm at their invasion, for the people took the  side, and the  would not have them harmed.\n\n\nWhen they entered  from , they could not take the  themselves, for some of the  ascended to the heights of . The peak of  called , which rises by itself near the town Neon, has room enough for a multitude of people. It was there that they carried their goods and themselves ascended to it,\n\nbut most of them made their way out of the country to the , where the town of  lies above the  plain. The barbarians, while the  so guided their army, overran the whole of . All that came within their power they laid waste to and burnt, setting fire to towns and temples.\n\n\nMarching this way down the river , they ravaged everything that lay in their way, burning the towns of , , , , , , , , , , , and , where there was a richly endowed temple of , provided with wealth of treasure and offerings. There was also then as now a place of divination at this place. This temple, too, they plundered and burnt, and they pursued and caught some of the  near the mountains. Certain women too perished because of the multitude of their violators.\n\n\nPassing , the foreigners came to . There their army parted into two companies. The greater and stronger part of the host marched with  himself towards  and broke into the territory of  in . Now the whole population of  took the  side, and men of  sent by  safeguarded their towns, each in his appointed place; the reason of the safeguarding was that  should see that the  were on the  side.\n\n\nSo this part of the barbarian army marched as I have said, and others set forth with guides for the temple at , keeping  on their right. These, too, laid waste to every part of  which they occupied, burning the towns of the  and  and .\nThe purpose of their parting from the rest of the army and marching this way was that they might plunder the temple at  and lay its wealth before , who (as I have been told) had better knowledge of the most notable possessions in the temple than of what he had left in his own palace, chiefly the offerings of  son of ; so many had always spoken of them.\n\n\nWhen the  learned all this, they were very much afraid, and in their great fear they inquired of the oracle whether they should bury the sacred treasure in the ground or take it away to another country. The god told them to move nothing, saying that he was able to protect what belonged to him.\nUpon hearing that, the  took thought for themselves. They sent their children and women overseas to . Most of the men went up to the peaks of  and carried their goods into the  cave, but some escaped to  in . In short, all the  left the town save sixty men and the prophet.\n\n\nNow when the barbarians drew near and could see the temple, the prophet, whose name was , saw certain sacred arms, which no man might touch without sacrilege, brought out of the chamber within and laid before the shrine.\nSo he went to tell the  of this miracle, but when the barbarians came with all speed near to the temple of , they were visited by miracles yet greater than the aforesaid. Marvellous indeed it is, that weapons of war should of their own motion appear lying outside in front of the shrine, but the visitation which followed was more wondrous than anything else ever seen.\nWhen the barbarians were near to the temple of , they were struck by thunderbolts from the sky, and two peaks broken off from  came rushing among them with a mighty noise and overwhelmed many of them. In addition to this a shout and a cry of triumph were heard from the temple of .\n\n\nAll of this together struck panic into the barbarians, and the , perceiving that they fled, descended upon them and killed a great number. The survivors fled straight to . Those of the barbarians who returned said (as I have been told) that they had seen other divine signs besides what I have just described: two men-at-arms of stature greater than human,they said, had come after them, slaying and pursuing.\n\n\nThese two, say the , were the native heroes  and , whose precincts are near the temple, ' by the road itself above the shrine of , and ' near the  spring, under the .\nThe rocks that fell from  were yet to be seen in my day, lying in the precinct of , from where their descent through the foreigners' ranks had hurled them. Such, then, was the manner of those men's departure from the temple.\n\n\nAt the request of the , the fleet of the  came from  and put in at . The  requested them to put in at  so that they take their children and women out of  and also take counsel what they should do. They had been disappointed in their plans, so they were going to hold a council about the current state of affairs.\nThey expected to find the entire population of the  in  awaiting the barbarian, but they found no such thing. They learned that they were fortifying the Isthmus instead and considered the defense of the  the most important thing, disregarding all the rest. When the  learned this, they asked the fleet to put in at .\n\n\nWhile the others put in at , the  landed in their own country. When they arrived, they made a proclamation that every  should save his children and servants as he best could. Thereupon most of them sent the members of their households to , and some to  and .\nThey were anxious to get everything out safely because they wished to obey the oracle, and also not least because of this: the  say that a great snake lives in the sacred precinct guarding the acropolis. They say this and even put out monthly offerings for it as if it really existed. The monthly offering is a honey-cake.\nIn all the time before this the honey-cake had been consumed, but this time it was untouched. When the priestess interpreted the significance of this, the  were all the more eager to abandon the city since the goddess had deserted the acropolis. When they had removed everything to safety, they returned to the camp.\n\n\nWhen those from  had put in at , the rest of the  fleet learned of this and streamed in from , for they had been commanded to assemble at , the harbor of . Many more ships assembled now than had fought at , and from more cities.\nThe admiral was the same as at ,  son of , a  but not of royal descent. The ships provided by the  were by far the most numerous and the most seaworthy.\n\n\nThe following took part in the war: from the , the  provided sixteen ships; the  the same number as at ; the  furnished fifteen ships, the  ten, the  five, the  three. All of these except the  are  and  and had last come from  and  and the  region. The  are , driven out of the country now called  by  and the .\n\n\nThese, then, were the  who took part in the war. From the mainland outside the  came the following: the  provided more than all the rest, one hundred and eighty ships. They provided these alone, since the  did not fight with the  at  for this reason: when the  departed from  and were off , the  landed on the opposite shore of  and attended to the removal of their households. In bringing these to safety they were left behind.\nThe , while the  ruled what is now called , were , bearing the name of . When  was their king they were called , and when  succeeded to the rule, they changed their name and became . When, however, Ion son of  was commander of the  army, they were called after him .\n\n\nThe  provided the same number as at . The  came to help with seven ships, and the , who are  from , with three.\n\n\nOf the islanders, the  provided thirty ships. They had other manned ships, but they guarded their own land with these and fought at  with the thirty most seaworthy. The  are  from , and their island was formerly called .\nAfter the  came the  with their twenty ships from , and the  with the same seven; these are . Next were the ,  from , with the same ships as before.\nThe  provided four ships. They had been sent by their fellow citizens to the , like the rest of the islanders, but they disregarded their orders and came to the  at the urging of , an esteemed man among the townsmen and at that time captain of a trireme. The  are  descended from .\nThe  provided the same number of ships as at , and the  one trireme and a fifty-oared boat; these are both . The , , and  also took part, since they were the only islanders who had not given earth and water to the barbarian.\n\n\nAll these people who live this side of  and the  took part in the war. The  border on the  and , who were the ones who came from the most distant countries to take part in the war. The only ones living beyond these to help  in its danger were the , with one ship. Its captain was , three times victor in the  games. The  are  by birth.\n\n\nAll of these came to the war providing triremes, except the  and  and , who brought fifty-oared boats. The  (who are of  stock) provided two; the  and , who are  from , one each. The total number of ships, besides the fifty-oared boats, was three hundred and seventy-eight.\n\n\nWhen the generals from the aforementioned cities, met at , they held a council and  proposed that whoever wanted to should give his opinion on what place under their control was most suitable for a sea battle.  was already lost, and he proposed that they consider the places which were left.\nThe consensus of most of the speakers was to sail to the Isthmus and fight at sea for the , giving this reason: if they were defeated in the fight at  they would be besieged on an island, where no help could come to them, but if they were at the Isthmus they could go ashore to their own lands.\n\n\nWhile the generals from the  considered this argument, an  came with the message that the barbarians had reached  and were destroying all of it by fire.\nThe army with  had made its way through  and burnt the city of the , who had abandoned it and gone to the , and  likewise. Now the army had come to  and was devastating everything there. The army burnt  and  upon learning from the  that they had not medized.\n\n\nSince the crossing of the , where the barbarians began their journey, they had spent one month there crossing into  and in three more months were in , when  was archon at .\nWhen they took the town it was deserted, but in the sacred precinct they found a few , stewards of the sacred precinct and poor people, who defended themselves against the assault by fencing the acropolis with doors and logs. They had not withdrawn to  not only because of poverty but also because they thought they had discovered the meaning of the oracle the  had given, namely that the wooden wall would be impregnable. They believed that according to the oracle this, not the ships, was the refuge.\n\n\nThe  took up a position on the hill opposite the acropolis, which the  call the , and besieged them in this way: they wrapped arrows in tar and set them on fire, and then shot them at the barricade. Still the besieged  defended themselves, although they had come to the utmost danger and their barricade had failed them.\nWhen the  proposed terms of surrender, they would not listen but contrived defenses such as rolling down boulders onto the barbarians when they came near the gates. For a long time  was at a loss, unable to capture them.\n\n\nIn time a way out of their difficulties was revealed to the barbarians, since according to the oracle all the mainland of  had to become subject to the . In front of the acropolis, and behind the gates and the ascent, was a place where no one was on guard, since no one thought any man could go up that way. Here some men climbed up, near the sacred precinct of ' daughter , although the place was a sheer cliff.\nWhen the  saw that they had ascended to the acropolis, some threw themselves off the wall and were killed, and others fled into the chamber. The  who had come up first turned to the gates, opened them, and murdered the suppliants. When they had levelled everything, they plundered the sacred precinct and set fire to the entire acropolis.\n\n\nSo it was that  took complete possession of , and he sent a horseman to  to announce his present success to . On the day after the messenger was sent, he called together the  exiles who accompanied him and asked them go up to the acropolis and perform sacrifices in their customary way, an order given because he had been inspired by a dream or because he felt remorse after burning the sacred precinct. The  exiles did as they were commanded.\n\n\nI will tell why I have mentioned this. In that acropolis is a shrine of , called the , and in the shrine are an olive tree and a pool of salt water. The story among the  is that they were set there by  and  as tokens when they contended for the land. It happened that the olive tree was burnt by the barbarians with the rest of the sacred precinct, but on the day after its burning, when the  ordered by the king to sacrifice went up to the sacred precinct, they saw a shoot of about a cubit's length sprung from the stump, and they reported this.\n\n\nWhen this business concerning the  acropolis was announced to the  at , some of the  generals became so alarmed that they did not even wait for the proposed matter to be decided, but jumped into their ships and hoisted their sails for flight. Those left behind resolved that the fleet should fight for the Isthmus. Night fell, and they dissolved the assembly and boarded their ships.\n\n\nWhen  returned to his ship, , an , asked him what had been decided. Learning from him that they had resolved to sail to the Isthmus and fight for the , he said,\n\nIf they depart from , you will no longer be fighting for one country. Each will make his way to his own city, and neither  nor any other man will be able to keep them from disbanding the army.  will be destroyed by bad planning. If there is any way at all that you could persuade  to change his decision and remain here, go try to undo this resolution.\n\n\nThis advice greatly pleased . He made no answer and went to the ship of . When he arrived there, he said he wanted to talk with him on a matter of common interest, so  bade him come aboard and say what he wanted.\n\n sat next to him and told him all that he had heard from , pretending it was his own idea and adding many other things. Finally by his entreaty he persuaded him to disembark and gather the generals for a council of war.\n\n\nWhen they were assembled and before  had a chance to put forward the reason he had called the generals together,  spoke at length in accordance with the urgency of his request. While he was speaking, the  general  son of  said, , at the games those who start before the signal are beaten with rods.  said in justification, Those left behind win no crown.\n\n\nHe answered the  mildly and said to  nothing of what he had said before, how if they put out from  they would flee different ways, for it would be unbecoming for him to accuse the allies in their presence. Instead he relied on a different argument and said,\n\n\nIt is in your hands to save , if you will obey me and remain here to fight, and not obey the words of these others and move your ships back to the Isthmus. Compare each plan after you have heard. If you join battle at the Isthmus, you will fight in the open sea where it is least to our advantage, since our ships are heavier and fewer in number. You will also lose  and  and , even if we succeed in all else. Their land army will accompany their fleet, and so you will lead them to the  and risk all .\n\nBut if you do what I say, you will find it useful in these ways: first, by engaging many ships with our few in the strait, we shall win a great victory, if the war turns out reasonably, for it is to our advantage to fight in a strait and to their advantage to fight in a wide area. Second,  will survive, where we have carried our children and women to safety. It also has in it something you are very fond of: by remaining here you will be fighting for the  just as much as at the Isthmus, and you will not lead them to the , if you exercise good judgment.\n\nIf what I expect happens and we win the victory with our ships, you will not have the barbarians upon you at the Isthmus. They will advance no further than  and depart in no order, and we shall gain an advantage by the survival of , , and , where it is prophesied that we will prevail against our enemies. Men usually succeed when they have reasonable plans. If their plans are unreasonable, the god does not wish to assent to human intentions.\n\n\nAs  said this,  the  attacked him again, advising that a man without a city should keep quiet and that  should not ask the vote of a man without a city. He advised  to contribute his opinion when he provided a cityattacking him in this way because  was captured and occupied.\n\n This time  said many things against him and the , declaring that so long as they had two hundred manned ships, the  had both a city and a land greater than theirs, and that none of the  could repel them if they attacked.\n\n\nNext he turned his argument to , saying more vehemently than before, If you remain here, you will be an noble man. If not, you will ruin . All our strength for war is in our ships, so listen to me.\nIf you do not do this, we will immediately gather up our households and travel to  in , which has been ours since ancient times, and the prophecies say we must found a colony there. You will remember these words when you are without such allies.\n\n\nWhen  said this,  changed his mind. I think he did so chiefly out of fear that the  might desert them if they set sail for the Isthmus. If the  left, the rest would be no match for the enemy, so he made the choice to remain there and fight.\n\n\nAfter this skirmish of words, since  had so resolved, the men at  prepared to fight where they were. At sunrise on the next day there was an earthquake on land and sea,\n\nand they resolved to pray to the gods and summon the sons of  as allies. When they had so resolved, they did as follows: they prayed to all the gods, called  and  to come straight from , and sent a ship to  for  and his sons.\n\n\n son of , an  exile who had become important among the , said that at the time when the land of  was being laid waste by ' army and there were no  in the country, he was with  the  on the  plain and saw advancing from  a cloud of dust as if raised by the feet of about thirty thousand men. They marvelled at what men might be raising such a cloud of dust and immediately heard a cry. The cry seemed to be the  of the mysteries,\n\nand when , ignorant of the rites of , asked him what was making this sound,  said, , there is no way that some great disaster will not befall the king's army. Since  is deserted, it is obvious that this voice is divine and comes from  to help the  and their allies.\nIf it descends upon the , the king himself and his army on the mainland will be endangered. If, however, it turns towards the ships at , the king will be in danger of losing his fleet.\nEvery year the  observe this festival for the Mother and the Maiden, and any  or other  who wishes is initiated. The voice which you hear is the  they cry at this festival. To this  replied, Keep silent and tell this to no one else.\nIf these words of yours are reported to the king, you will lose your head, and neither I nor any other man will be able to save you, so be silent. The gods will see to the army.\nThus he advised, and after the dust and the cry came a cloud, which rose aloft and floated away towards  to the camp of the . In this way they understood that ' fleet was going to be destroyed.  son of  used to say this, appealing to  and others as witnesses.\n\n\nWhen those stationed with ' fleet had been to see the  disaster at , they crossed over from  to , waited three days, and then sailed through the , and in three more days they were at , the port of . I think no less a number invaded  by land and sea than came to Sepias and .\nThose killed by the storm, at , and in the naval battles at , I offset with those who did not yet follow the king: the  and  and  and the whole force of  except the  and ; and the  and  and  and all the rest of the islanders, except the five cities whose names I previously mentioned. The farther into  the  advanced, the more nations followed him.\n\n\nAll these came to  except the . The  stayed behind in  watching to see which way the war turned out. When the rest of them reached ,  himself went down to the ships, wishing to mix with the sailors and hear their opinions.\nHe came and sat on his throne, and present at his summons were the tyrants of all the peoples and the company leaders from the fleet. They sat according to the honor which the king had granted each of them, first the king of , then the king of , then the rest. When they sat in order one after another,  sent  to test each by asking if they should fight at sea.\n\n\n went about questioning them, starting with the , and all the others were unanimous, advising to fight at sea, but  said,\n\n\nTell the king, , that I, who neither was most cowardly in the sea battles off  nor performed the least feats of arms, say this: Master, it is just for me to declare my real opinion, what I consider to be best for your cause. And I say to you this: spare your ships, and do not fight at sea. Their men are as much stronger than your men by sea as men are stronger than women.\nWhy is it so necessary for you to risk everything by fighting at sea? Do you not possess , for which you set out on this march, and do you not have the rest of ? No one stands in your way. Those who opposed you have received what they deserved.\n\nI will tell you how I think the affairs of your enemies will turn out: If you do not hurry to fight at sea, but keep your ships here and stay near land, or even advance into the , then, my lord, you will easily accomplish what you had in mind on coming here.\nThe  are not able to hold out against you for a long time, but you will scatter them, and they will each flee to their own cities. I have learned that they have no food on this island, and it is not likely, if you lead your army against the , that those of them who have come from there will sit still, nor will they care to fight at sea for .\n\nBut if you hurry to fight at sea immediately, I fear that your fleet if reduced to cowardice may also injure your army on land. In addition, my King, take this to heart: Good people's slaves tend to be base, and the slaves of the base tend to be good. You, who are best among men, have base slaves, who are accounted your allies, the  and  and  and , who are of no use at all.\n\n\nWhen she said this to , all who were well disposed towards  lamented her words, thinking she would suffer some ill from the king because she advised against fighting at sea. Those who were jealous and envied her, because she was given honor among the chief of all the allies, were glad at her answer, thinking she would be killed.\nBut when the counsels were reported to , he was greatly pleased by 's opinion. Even before this he had considered her of excellent character, and now he praised her much more highly. Still he ordered that the majority be obeyed, for he believed that at  they had purposely fought badly because he was not there. This time he had made preparations to see the battle in person.\n\n\nWhen the command to put out to sea was given, they set sail for  and were calmly marshalled in line. There was not enough daylight left for them to fight, since night came on, so they made preparations for the next day.\n\n Fear and dread possessed the , especially those from the . They were afraid because they were stationed in  and were about to fight at sea on behalf of the land of the , and if they were defeated they would be trapped on an island and besieged, leaving their own land unguarded.\n\n\nThat very night the land army of the barbarians began marching to the . Yet every possible device had been used to prevent the barbarians from invading by the mainland. As soon as the  learned that  and his men at  were dead, they ran together from their cities and took up their position at the Isthmus. Their general was  son of , the brother of .\n\n When they were in position at the Isthmus, they demolished the  road and then, after resolving in council, built a wall across the Isthmus. Since there were many tens of thousands and everyone worked, the task was completed, as they brought in stones and bricks and logs and baskets full of sand. At no moment of the day or night did those who had marched out there rest from their work.\n\n\nThese were the  who marched out in a body to the Isthmus: the  and all the , the  and  and  and  and  and  and . These were the ones who marched out and feared for  in her peril. The rest of the  cared nothing, though the  and  festivals were now past.\n\n\nSeven nations inhabit the . Two of these are aboriginal and are now settled in the land where they lived in the old days, the  and . One nation, the , has never left the , but it has left its own country and inhabits another nation's land.\nThe four remaining nations of the seven are immigrants, the  and  and  and . The  have many famous cities, the  only , the   and  near , the  all the .\nThe  are aboriginal and seem to be the only , but they have been Dorianized by time and by  rule. They are the  and the perioikoi. All the remaining cities of these seven nations, except those I enumerated, stayed neutral. If I may speak freely, by staying neutral they medized.\n\n\nThose at the Isthmus were involved in so great a labor, since all they had was at stake and they did not expect the ships to win distinction. Those at  heard of their labors but still were full of dread, fearing not for themselves but for the .\nFor a time each man talked quietly to his neighbor, wondering at ' folly, but finally it came out into the open. They held an assembly and talked at length on the same matters as before: some said they must sail away to the  and risk battle for that country, not stay and fight for a captured land; but the  and  and  said they must stay and defend themselves.\n\n\nWhen the  were outvoting him,  secretly left the assembly, and sent a man by boat to the Median fleet after ordering him what to say. His name was , and he was ' servant and his sons' attendant. Later  enrolled him as a , when the  were adopting citizens, and made him wealthy with money.\nHe now came by boat and said to the generals of the barbarians, The  general has sent me without the knowledge of the other . He is on the king's side and prefers that your affairs prevail, not the '. I am to tell you that the  are terrified and plan flight, and you can now perform the finest deed of all if you do not allow them to escape.\nThey do not all have the same intent, and they will no longer oppose you. Instead you will see them fighting against themselves, those who are on your side against those who are not. After indicating this to them he departed.\n\n\nFinding the message credible, they first landed many of the  on the islet of , which lies between  and the mainland. When it was midnight, they brought their western wing in a circle towards , and those stationed at  and  also put out to sea, occupying all the passage as far as  with their ships.\nThey launched their ships in this way so that the  would have no escape: they would be trapped at  and pay the penalty for the battles at . The purpose of their landing  on the islet called  was this: when the battle took place, it was chiefly there that the men and wrecks would be washed ashore, for the island lay in the path of the impending battle. The  would be able to save some of those who washed up and kill the others.\n\n They did this in silence for fear that their enemies hear, making their preparations at night without sleep.\n\n\nI cannot say against oracles that they are not true, and I do not wish to try to discredit them when they speak plainly. Look at the following matter: \n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering this, I dare to say nothing against  concerning oracles when he speaks so plainly, nor will I consent to it by others.\n\n\nAmong the generals at  there was fierce argument. They did not yet know that the barbarians had encircled them with their ships, supposing them still marshalled in the place where they had seen them by day.\n\n\nAs the generals disputed,  son of , an , crossed over from . Although he had been ostracized by the people, I, learning by inquiry of his character, have come to believe that he was the best and most just man in .\nThis man stood at the assembly and called  out, although he was no friend of his, but his bitter enemy. Because of the magnitude of the present ills, he deliberately forgot all that and called him out, wanting to talk to him. He had already heard that those from the  were anxious to set sail for the Isthmus,\n\nso when  came out he said, On all occasions and especially now our contention must be over which of us will do our country more good.\nI say that it is all the same for the  to speak much or little about sailing away from here, for I have seen with my own eyes that even if the  and  himself wanted to, they would not be able to escape. We are encircled by the enemy. Go in and indicate this to them.\n\n\n answered, Your exhortation is most useful and you bring good news. You have come as an eyewitness of just what I wanted to happen. Know that I am the cause of what the  are doing. When the  would not willingly enter battle, it was necessary to force them against their will. Since you have come bringing good news, tell it to them yourself.\nIf I say these things, they will think I invented it, and they will not believe that the barbarians are doing this. Go in yourself and let them know how it stands. It would be best if they believe you when you tell them, but if they find these things incredible it is all the same to us. They will not be able to run away, if indeed we are surrounded on all sides as you say.\n\n\n went in and told them, saying that he had come from  and had barely made it past the blockade when he sailed out, since all the  camp was surrounded by ' ships. He advised them to prepare to defend themselves. He said this and left, and again a dispute arose among them. The majority of the generals did not believe the news.\n\n\nWhile they were still held by disbelief, a trireme of  deserters arrived, captained by  son of , which brought them the whole truth. For this deed the  were engraved on the tripod at  with those who had conquered the barbarian.\nWith this ship that deserted at  and the  which deserted earlier at , the  fleet reached its full number of three hundred and eighty ships, for it had fallen short of the number by two ships.\n\n\nWhen they found the words of the  worthy of belief, the  prepared to fight at sea. As dawn glimmered, they held an assembly of the fighting men, and  gave the best address among the others. His entire speech involved comparing the better and lesser elements in human nature and the human condition.\nHe concluded his speech by advising them to choose the better of these, then gave the command to mount the ships. Just as they embarked, the trireme which had gone after the sons of  arrived from .\n\n\nThen the  set sail with all their ships, and as they were putting out to sea the barbarians immediately attacked them.  The rest of the  began to back water and tried to beach their ships, but  of , an , charged and rammed a ship. When his ship became entangled and the crew could not free it, the others came to help  and joined battle.\nThe  say that the fighting at sea began this way, but the  say that the ship which had been sent to  after the sons of  was the one that started it. The story is also told that the phantom of a woman appeared to them, who cried commands loud enough for all the  fleet to hear, reproaching them first with, Men possessed, how long will you still be backing water?\n\n\nThe  were marshalled against the , holding the western wing toward . Against the  were the , on the eastern wing toward , and a few of them fought badly according to ' instructions, but the majority did not.\nI can list the names of many captains who captured  ships, but I will mention none except  son of  and  son of , both .\nI mention only these because  was appointed tyrant of  by the  for this feat, and  was recorded as a benefactor of the king and granted much land. The king's benefactors are called orosangae in the  language.\n\n\nThus it was concerning them. But the majority of the ships at  were sunk, some destroyed by the , some by the . Since the  fought in an orderly fashion by line, but the barbarians were no longer in position and did nothing with forethought, it was likely to turn out as it did. Yet they were brave that day, much more brave than they had been at , for they all showed zeal out of fear of , each one thinking that the king was watching him.\n\n\nI cannot say exactly how each of the other barbarians or  fought, but this is what happened to , and it gave her still higher esteem with the king:\nWhen the king's side was all in commotion, at that time 's ship was pursued by a ship of . She could not escape, for other allied ships were in front of her and hers was the nearest to the enemy. So she resolved to do something which did in fact benefit her: as she was pursued by the Attic ship, she charged and rammed an allied ship, with a  crew and  himself, king of the , aboard.\nI cannot say if she had some quarrel with him while they were still at the , or whether she did this intentionally or if the ship of the  fell in her path by chance.\nBut when she rammed and sank it, she had the luck of gaining two advantages. When the captain of the Attic ship saw her ram a ship with a barbarian crew, he decided that 's ship was either  or a deserter from the barbarians fighting for them, so he turned away to deal with others.\n\n\nThus she happened to escape and not be destroyed, and it also turned out that the harmful thing which she had done won her exceptional esteem from .\nIt is said that the king, as he watched the battle, saw her ship ram the other, and one of the bystanders said, Master, do you see how well  contends in the contest and how she has sunk an enemy ship? When he asked if the deed was truly 's, they affirmed it, knowing reliably the marking of her ship, and they supposed that the ruined ship was an enemy.\nAs I have said, all this happened to bring her luck, and also that no one from the  ship survived to accuse her. It is said that  replied to what was told him, My men have become women, and my women men. They say this is what  said.\n\n\nIn this struggle the general  died, son of  and the brother of . Many other famous men of the  and  and other allies also died, but only a few , since they knew how to swim. Those whose ships were sunk swam across to , unless they were killed in action,\n\nbut many of the barbarians drowned in the sea since they did not know how to swim. Most of the ships were sunk when those in the front turned to flee, since those marshalled in the rear, as they tried to go forward with their ships so they too could display some feat to the king, ran afoul of their own side's ships in flight.\n\n\nIt also happened in this commotion that certain  whose ships had been destroyed came to the king and accused the  of treason, saying that it was by their doing that the ships had been lost. It turned out that the  generals were not put to death, and those  who slandered them were rewarded as I will show.\nWhile they were still speaking, a  ship rammed an Attic ship. The  ship sank and an  ship bore down and sank the  ship, but the , being javelin-throwers, by pelting them with missiles knocked the fighters off the ship that had sunk theirs and boarded and seized it.\nThis saved the . In his deep vexation  blamed everyone.  When he saw the  performing this great feat, he turned to the  and commanded that their heads be cut off, so that they who were base not slander men more noble.\nWhenever , as he sat beneath the mountain opposite  which is called , saw one of his own men achieve some feat in the battle, he inquired who did it, and his scribes wrote down the captain's name with his father and city of residence. The presence of , a  and a friend of the , contributed still more to this calamity of the .  Thus they dealt with the . \n\n\nThe barbarians were routed and tried to flee by sailing out to , but the  lay in wait for them in the strait and then performed deeds worth telling. The  in the commotion destroyed those ships which either resisted or tried to flee, the  those sailing out of the strait. Whoever escaped from the  charged right into the .\n\n\nThe ships of , as he was pursuing a ship, and of  son of , an , then met.  had rammed a  ship, the one which had captured the  ship that was on watch off , and on it was  son of , the one the  marvelled at when severely wounded and kept aboard their ship because of his virtue. This  ship carrying him with the  was now captured, so  came back safe to .\nWhen  saw the Attic ship, he recognized it by seeing the flagship's marking and shouted to , mocking and reproaching him concerning the Medizing of the . After ramming an enemy ship,  hurled these insults at . The barbarians whose ships were still intact fled and reached  under cover of the land army.\n\n\nIn this battle the  with the reputation as most courageous were the , then the . Among individuals they were  the  and the   of  and  of , the one who pursued . If he had known she was in that ship, he would not have stopped before either capturing it or being captured himself.\nSuch were the orders given to the  captains, and there was a prize offered of ten thousand drachmas to whoever took her alive, since they were indignant that a woman waged war against . But she escaped, as I said earlier, and the others whose ships survived were also in .\n\n\nThe  say that when the ships joined battle, the  general , struck with bewilderment and terror, hoisted his sails and fled away. When the  saw their flagship fleeing, they departed in the same way,\n\nbut when in their flight they were opposite the sacred precinct of  on , by divine guidance a boat encountered them. No one appeared to have sent it, and the  knew nothing about the affairs of the fleet when it approached. They reckon the affair to involve the gods because when the boat came near the ships, the people on the boat said,\n\n, you have turned your ships to flight and betrayed the , but they are overcoming their enemies to the fulfillment of their prayers for victory.  did not believe them when they said this, so they spoke again, saying that they could be taken as hostages and killed if the  were not seen to be victorious.\nSo he and the others turned their ships around and came to the fleet, but it was all over. The  spread this rumor about them, but the  do not agree at all, and they consider themselves to have been among the foremost in the battle. The rest of  bears them witness.\n\n\n son of , the  whom I mentioned a little before this as a valiant man, did this in the commotion that arose at : taking many of the armed men who were arrayed along the shore of , he brought them across and landed them on the island of , and they slaughtered all the  who were on that islet.\n\n\nWhen the battle was broken off, the  towed to  as many of the wrecks as were still there and kept ready for another battle, supposing that the king could still make use of his surviving ships.\nA west wind had caught many of the wrecks and carried them to the shore in  called . Thus not only was all the rest of the oracle fulfilled which  and  had spoken about this battle, but also what had been said many years before this in an oracle by , an  soothsayer, concerning the wrecks carried to shore there. Its meaning had eluded all the :\n\n\n\n\nWhen  understood the calamity which had taken place, he feared that some of the  might advise the , if they did not think of it themselves, to sail to the  and destroy the bridges. He would be trapped in  in danger of destruction, so he resolved on flight. He did not want to be detected either by the  or by his own men, so he attempted to build a dike across to , and joined together  cargo ships to be both a bridge and a wall, making preparations as if to fight another sea battle.\nAll who saw him doing this confidently supposed that he fully intended to stay and fight there, but none of this eluded , who had the most experience of the king's intentions. While doing all this,  sent a messenger to  to announce the disaster.\n\n\nWhile  did thus, he sent a messenger to  with news of his present misfortune. Now there is nothing mortal that accomplishes a course more swiftly than do these messengers, by the ' skillful contrivance. It is said that as many days as there are in the whole journey, so many are the men and horses that stand along the road, each horse and man at the interval of a day's journey. These are stopped neither by snow nor rain nor heat nor darkness from accomplishing their appointed course with all speed.\nThe first rider delivers his charge to the second, the second to the third, and thence it passes on from hand to hand, even as in the  torch-bearers' race in honor of . This riding-post is called in , angareion.\n\n\nWhen the first message came to , saying that  had taken , it gave such delight to the  who were left at home that they strewed all the roads with myrtle boughs and burnt incense and gave themselves up to sacrificial feasts and jollity.\nThe second, however, coming on the heels of the first, so confounded them that they all tore their tunics, and cried and lamented without ceasing, holding  to blame; it was not so much in grief for their ships that they did this as because they feared for  himself.\n\n\nSuch was the plight of the  for all the time until the coming of  himself ended it. , however, seeing that  was greatly distressed because of the sea-fight, and suspecting that he planned flight from , thought that he would be punished for persuading the king to march against  and that it was better for him to risk the chance of either subduing  or dying honorably while engaged in a noble cause; yet his hope rather inclined to the subduing of . Taking all this into account, he made this proposal:\n\nSire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed because of what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses; furthermore, there is no one among these men, who thinks that he has now won a crowning victory and will disembark from his ship in an attempt to withstand you, no, nor anyone from this mainland. Those who have withstood us have paid the penalty.\nIf then you so desire, let us straightway attack the , or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do. Do not be downcast, for the  have no way of escaping guilt for their former and their later deeds and from becoming your slaves. It is best then that you should do as I have said, but if you have resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan.\nDo not, O king, make the  the laughing-stock of the , for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the . Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if  and  and  and  have so done, it is not the  who have any part in this disaster.\nTherefore, since the  are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver  to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.\n\n\nWhen  heard that, he was as glad and joyful as a man in his situation might be and said to  that he would answer him after deliberating which of the two plans he would follow. When he consulted with those  whom he summoned, he resolved to send for  as well, because he saw that she alone at the former sitting had discerned what was best to do.\nWhen  came,  bade all others withdraw, both  councillors and guards, and said to her: It is ' advice that I should follow here and attack the , for the , he says, and the land army are not to blame for our disaster; of that they would willingly give proof.\nTherefore he advises me to do this, or else he offers to choose three hundred thousand men of the army and deliver  to me enslaved, while I myself by his counsel march homeward with the rest of the host.\nNow I ask of you, seeing that you correctly advised me against the late sea-fight, counsel me as to which of these two things would be best for me to do.\n\n\nWhen she was asked for advice, she replied: It is difficult, O king, to answer your plea for advice by saying that which is best, but in the present turn of affairs I think it best that you march back and that , if he so wishes and promises to do as he says, be left here with those whom he desires.\nFor if he subdues all that he offers to subdue and prospers in his design, the achievement, Sire, is yours since it will be your servants who have accomplished it. If, on the other hand, the issue is contrary to ' expectation, it is no great misfortune so long as you and all that household of yours are safe;\n\nfor while you and the members of your household are safe, many a time will the  have to fight for their lives. As for , if any disaster befalls him, it is does not much matter, nor will any victory of the  be a real victory when they have but slain your servant. As for you, you will be marching home after the burning of , which thing was the whole purpose of your expedition.\n\n\n's counsel pleased , for it happened that she spoke what he himself had in mind. In truth, I think that he would not have remained even if all men and women had counselled him so to doso panic-stricken was he. Having then thanked , he sent her away to take his sons to , for he had some bastard sons with him.\n\n\nWith these sons he sent  as guardian. This man was by birth of , and the most honored by  of all his eunuchs. The people of  dwell above . The following thing happens among these people: when anything untoward is about to befall those who dwell about their city, the priestess of  then grows a great beard. This had already happened to them twice.\n\n\n, who came from , had achieved a fuller vengeance for wrong done to him than had any man whom we know. When he had been taken captive by enemies and put up for sale, he was bought by one  of , a man who had set himself to earn a livelihood out of most wicked practices. He would procure beautiful boys and castrate and take them to  and  where he sold them for a great price,\n\nfor the barbarians value eunuchs more than perfect men, by reason of the full trust that they have in them. Now among the many whom  had castrated was , who was not entirely unfortunate; he was brought from  together with other gifts to the king, and as time went on, he stood higher in ' favor than any other eunuch.\n\n\nNow while the king was at  and preparing to lead his  army against ,  came for some business down to the part of  which is inhabited by  and called . There he found .\nPerceiving who he was, he held long and friendly converse with him, telling him that it was to him that he owed all this prosperity and promising that he would make him prosperous in return if he were to bring his household and dwell there.  accepted his offer gladly, and brought his children and his wife.\nWhen  had gotten the man and all his household into his power, he said to him: Tell me, you who have made a livelihood out of the wickedest trade on earth, what harm had I or any of my forefathers done to you or yours, that you made me to be no man, but a thing of nought? You no doubt thought that the gods would have no knowledge of your former practices, but their just law has brought you for your wicked deeds into my hands. Now you will be well content with the fullness of that justice which I will execute upon you.\nWith these words of reproach, he brought ' sons before him and compelled him to castrate all four of themhis own children; this  was compelled to do. When he had done this, the sons were compelled to castrate their father in turn. This, then, was the way in which  was overtaken by vengeance at the hands of .\n\n\nHaving given his sons to 's charge to be carried to ,  called  to him and bade him choose whom he would from the army, and make his words good so far as endeavor availed. That is as far as matters went on that day; in the night, however, the admirals, by the king's command, put out to sea from  and made for the  again with all speed to guard the bridges for the king's passage.\nWhen the barbarians came near to the Girdle in their course, they thought that certain little headlands, which here jut out from the mainland, were ships, and they fled for a long way. When they learned at last that they were no ships but headlands, they drew together and went on their way.\n\n\nWhen it was day, the  saw the land army abiding where it had been and supposed the ships also to be at . Thinking also that there would be a sea-fight they prepared to defend themselves. When, however, they learned that the ships were gone, they straightway resolved on pursuit; so they pursued ' fleet as far as , but failed to catch sight of it. When they came to , they held a council there.\n\n declared his opinion that they should hold their course through the islands, and having pursued the ships, should sail forthwith to the  to break the bridges. , on the other hand, offered a contrary opinion, saying that to break the bridges would be the greatest harm that they could do to .\n\nFor, said he, if the  is cut off and compelled to remain in , he will attempt not to be inactive. This he will do because if he remains inactive, he can neither make his cause prosper nor find any way of return home, but his army will perish of hunger. If, on the other hand, he is enterprising and active, it may well be that every town and nation in  will join itself to him, by conquest or, before that, by compact. He will then live on whatever yearly fruits of the earth  produces.\nBut, as I think that the  will not remain in  after his defeat in the sea-fight, let us permit him to flee to his own country. Thereafter let it be that country and not ours which is at stake in the war. With that opinion the rest of the  admirals also agreed.\n\n\nWhen  perceived that he could not persuade the greater part of them to sail to the , he turned to the  (for they were the angriest at the ' escape, and they were minded to sail to the  even by themselves, if the rest would not) and addressed them as follows:\n\nThis I have often seen with my eyes and heard yet more often, namely that beaten men, when they be driven to bay, will rally and retrieve their former mishap. Therefore I say to you,as it is to a fortunate chance that we owe ourselves and , and have driven away so mighty a band of enemieslet us not pursue men who flee,\n\nfor it is not we who have won this victory, but the gods and the heroes, who deemed  and  too great a realm for one man to rule, and that a wicked man and an impious one who dealt alike with temples and bones, burning and overthrowing the images of the gods,yes, and one who scourged the sea and threw fetters into it.\nBut as it is well with us for the moment, let us abide now in  and take thought for ourselves and our households. Let us build our houses again and be diligent in sowing, when we have driven the foreigner completely away. Then when the next spring comes, let us set sail for the  and .\nThis he said with intent to have something to his credit with the , so that he might have a place of refuge if ever (as might chance) he should suffer anything at the hands of the and just that did in fact happen.\n\n\nThus spoke  with intent to deceive, and the  obeyed him; since he had always been esteemed wise and now had shown himself to be both wise and prudent, they were ready to obey whatever he said.\nHaving won them over,  straightway sent men in a boat whom he could trust not to reveal under any question the message which he charged them to deliver to the king; one of these was his servant . When these men came to , the rest remained with the boat, and  went up to ;\n\n son of , he said, who is the  general and of all the allies the worthiest and wisest, has sent me to tell you this:  the  has out of his desire to do you a service stayed the  when they wanted to pursue your ships and break the bridges of the . Now he bids you go your way, none hindering you. With that message, the men returned in their boat.\n\n\nBut the , now that they were no longer minded to pursue the barbarians' ships farther or sail to the  and break the way of passage, besieged  so that they might take it,\n\nfor the men of that place, the first islanders of whom  demanded money, would not give it. When, however,  gave them to understand that the  had come with two great gods to aid them, Persuasion and Necessity, and that the  must therefore certainly give money, they said in response, It is then but reasonable that  is great and prosperous, being blessed with serviceable gods.\nAs for us , we are but blessed with a plentiful lack of land, and we have two unserviceable gods who never quit our island but want to dwell there forever, namely Poverty and Helplessness. Since we are in the hands of these gods, we will give no money; the power of  can never be stronger than our inability.\n\n\nIt was for giving this answer and refusing to give what was asked of them that they were besieged. There was no end to ' avarice; using the same agents whom he had used with the king, he sent threatening messages to the other islands, demanding money and saying that if they would not give what he asked he would bring the  armada upon them and besiege and take their islands.\nThereby he collected great sums from the  and , for these were informed that  was besieged for taking the  side and that  was of all the generals the most esteemed. This frightened them so much that they sent money. I suppose that there were other islanders too who gave and not these alone, but I cannot with certainty say.\nNevertheless, the  got no respite from misfortune by doing this. The , however, propitiated  with money and so escaped the force. So  went away from  and took money from the islanders, unknown to the other generals.\n\n\nThose who were with  waited for a few days after the sea-fight and then marched away to  by the road by which they had come.  wanted to give the king safe conduct and thought the time of year unseasonable for war; it was better, he thought, to winter in , and then attack the  in the spring.\nWhen they had arrived in ,  first chose all the  called Immortals, save only  their general who said that he would not quit the king's person, and next, the  cuirassiers and the thousand horse and the  and  and  and , alike their infantrymen and the rest of the horsemen.\nThese nations he chose in their entirety; of the rest of his allies he picked out a few from each people, the best men and those whom he knew to have done some good service. The  whom he chose (men who wore torques and bracelets) were more in number than those of any other nation and next to them the ; these indeed were as many as the , but not such stout fighters. Thereby the whole number, together with the horsemen, grew to three hundred thousand men.\n\n\nNow while  was choosing his army and  was in , there came an oracle from  to the , that they should demand justice of  for the slaying of  and take whatever he should offer them. The  then sent a herald with all speed. He found the army yet undivided in , came into ' presence, and spoke as follows:\n\nThe  and the  of  demand of you, king of the , that you pay the penalty for the death of their king, whom you killed while he defended . At that  laughed, and after a long while, he pointed to , who chanced to be standing by him and said, Then here is , who shall pay those you speak of such penalty as befits them.\n\n\nSo the herald took that response and departed, but  left  in . He himself journeyed with all speed to the  and came in forty-five days to the passage for crossing, bringing back with him as good as none (if one may say so) of his host.\nWherever and to whatever people they came, they seized and devoured its produce. If they found none, they would eat the grass of the field and strip the bark and pluck the leaves of the trees, garden and wild alike, leaving nothingsuch was the degree of their starvation.\nMoreover, pestilence and dysentery broke out among them on their way, from which they died. Some who were sick  left behind, charging the cities to which he came in his march to care for them and nourish them, some in  and some in  of  and in .\nIn  he had left the sacred chariot of  when he was marching to , but on his return he did not get it back again. The  had given it to the , and when  demanded it back, they said that the horses had been carried off from pasture by the  of the hills who dwelt about the headwaters of the .\n\n\nIt was then that a monstrous deed was done by the  king of the  and the  country. He had refused to be of his own free will ' slave, and fled to the mountains called . He forbade his sons to go with the army to ,\n\nbut they took no account of that; they had always wanted to see the war, and they followed the ' march. For this reason, when all the six of them returned back scatheless, their father tore out their eyes.\n\n\nThis was their reward. Now the , journeying through  to the passage, made haste to cross to  in their ships, for they found the bridges no longer made fast but broken by a storm. There their march halted, and more food was given them than on their way.\nThen by reason of their immoderate gorging and the change of the water which they drank, many of the army that had survived died. The rest came with  to .\n\n\nThere is, however, another tale, which is this: when  came in his march from  to  on the , he travelled no farther than that by land, but committed his army to  to be led to the . He himself embarked and set sail for  in a  ship.\nIn the course of this voyage he was caught by a strong wind called the , which lifted up the waves. This storm bearing the harder upon him by reason of the heavy load of the ship (for the  of his company who were on the deck were so many), the king grew afraid and cried to the ship's pilot asking him if there were any way of deliverance. To this the man said,\n\nSire, there is none, if we do not rid ourselves of these many who are on board. Hearing that, it is said,  said to the , Now it is for you to prove your concern for your king, for it seems that my deliverance rests with you.\nAt this they bowed and leapt into the sea. The ship, now much lighter, came by these means safe to . No sooner had  disembarked on land, than he made the pilot a gift of a golden crown for saving the king's life but cut off his head for being the death of many .\n\n\nThis is the other tale of ' return; but I for my part believe neither the story of the ' fate nor any other part of it. For if indeed the pilot had spoken to  in this way, I think that there is not one in ten thousand who would not say that the king would have bidden the men on deck (who were  and of the best blood of ) descend into the ship's hold, and would have taken from the  rowers a number equal to the number of the  and cast them into the sea. No, the truth is that  did as I have already said, and returned to  with his army by road.\n\n\nThere is further proof of this, for it is known that when  came to  in his return, he made a compact of friendship with its people and gave them a golden sword and a gilt tiara. As the people of  say (but for my part I wholly disbelieve them), it was here that  in his flight back from  first loosed his girdle, as being here in safety. Now  lies nearer to the  than the  and , where they say that he took ship.\n\n\nAs for the , not being able to take , they went to . When they had laid it waste, they returned to . First of all they set apart for the gods, among other first-fruits, three  triremes, one to be dedicated at the Isthmus, where it was till my lifetime, the second at , and the third for  at  where they were.\nAfter that, they divided the spoils and sent the first-fruits of it to ; of this was made a man's image twelve cubits high, holding in his hand the figurehead of a ship. This stood in the same place as the golden statue of  the .\n\n\nHaving sent the first-fruits to , the , in the name of the country generally, made inquiry of the god whether the first-fruits which he had received were of full measure and whether he was content. To this he said that he was content with what he had received from all other , but not from the . From these he demanded the victor's prize for the sea-fight of . When the  learned that, they dedicated three golden stars which are set on a bronze mast, in the angle, nearest to ' bowl.\n\n\nAfter the division of the spoils, the  sailed to the Isthmus, there to award the prize of excellence to him who had shown himself most worthy of it in that war.\nBut when the admirals came and at the altar of  gave their votes to judge who was first and who second among them, each of them voted for himself, supposing himself to have done the best service. The greater part of them, however, united in giving the second place to . So they each gained but one vote, while  far outstripped them in votes for the second place.\n\n\nThe  were too jealous to assign the prize and sailed away each to his own place, leaving the matter undecided; nevertheless,  was lauded, and throughout all of  was deemed the wisest man by far of the .\nHowever, because he had not received from those that fought at  the honor due to his preeminence, he immediately afterwards went to  in order that he might receive honor there. The  welcomed him and paid him high honor. They bestowed on  a crown of olive as the reward of excellence and another such crown on  for his wisdom and cleverness. They also gave him the finest chariot in ,\n\nand with many words of praise, they sent him home with the three hundred picked men of  who are called Knights to escort him as far as the borders of .  was the only man of whom we know to whom the  gave this escort.\n\n\nBut when  returned to  from ,  of , who was one of ' enemies but not a man of note, was crazed with envy and spoke bitterly to  of his visit to , saying that the honors he had from the  were paid him for ' sake and not for his own.\nThis he kept saying until  replied, This is the truth of the matter: if I had been a man of  I would not have been honored in this way by the , nor would you, sir, for all you are a man of . Such was the end of that business.\n\n\n son of , who was already a notable man among the  and grew to be yet more so through the  business, escorted the king as far as the passage with sixty thousand men of the army that  had chosen.\n\n, then, was now in , and when  came near  in his return (for  was wintering in  and  and making no haste to come to the rest of his army), he thought it right that he should enslave the people of , whom he found in revolt.\nWhen the king had marched away past the town and the  fleet had taken flight from ,  had openly revolted from the barbarians and so too had the rest of the people of .\n\n\nThereupon  laid siege to , and suspecting that  too was plotting revolt from the king, he laid siege to it also. This town was held by  who had been driven from the  by the . Having besieged and taken , he brought these men to a lake and there cut their throats and delivered their city over to the charge of  of  and the  people. It was in this way that the  gained possession of .\n\n\nHaving taken ,  dealt immediately with , and his zeal was aided by  the general of the , who agreed to betray the place to him. I do not know how the agreement was first made, since there is no information available about it. The result, however, was as I will now show. Whenever  wrote a letter to be sent to , or  to , they would wrap it around the shaft of an arrow at the notches, attach feathers to the letter, and shoot it to a place upon which they had agreed.\n\n' plot to betray  was, however, discovered, for  in shooting an arrow to the place agreed upon, missed it and hit the shoulder of a man of . A throng gathered quickly around the man when he was struck (which is a thing that always happens in war), and they straightway took the arrow, found the letter, and carried it to their generals; the rest of their allies of  were also there present.\nThe generals read the letter and perceived who was the traitor, but they resolved for 's sake that they would not condemn  with a charge of treason, for fear that the people of  should hereafter be called traitors.\n\n\nThis is how ' treachery was brought to light. But when  had besieged  for three months, there was a great ebb-tide in the sea which lasted for a long while, and when the foreigners saw that the sea was turned to a marsh, they prepared to pass over it into .\nWhen they had made their way over two-fifths of it, however, and three yet remained to cross before they could be in , there came a great flood-tide, higher, as the people of the place say, than any one of the many that had been before. Some of them who did not know how to swim were drowned, and those who knew were slain by the , who came among them in boats.\nThe  say that the cause of the high sea and flood and the  disaster lay in the fact that those same  who now perished in the sea had profaned the temple and the image of  which was in the suburb of the city. I think that in saying that this was the cause they are correct. Those who escaped alive were led away by  to  in . This is how the men who had been the king's escort fared.\n\n\nAll that was left of ' fleet, having in its flight from  touched the coast of  and ferried the king and his army over from the  to , wintered at . Then early in the first dawn of spring they mustered at , where some of the ships had wintered. The majority of their fighting men were  and .\n\n son of  and  son of  came to be their admirals, and  chose also his own nephew  to have a share in the command. But by reason of the heavy blow dealt them they went no further out to sea westwards, nor did anyone insist that they should so do. They did, however, lie off  keeping watch against a revolt in . The whole number of their ships,  and other, was three hundred.\nIn truth they did not expect that the  would come to , but rather that they would be content to guard their own country. This they thought because the  had not pursued them when they fled from , but had been glad to be quit of them. In regard to the sea, the  were at heart beaten men, but they supposed that on land  would easily prevail.\nSo they were at , and there planned to do what harm they could to their enemies and to listen in the interim for news of how ' affairs were proceeding.\n\n\nAs for the , the coming of spring and ' being in  moved them to action. They had not yet begun the mustering of their army, but their fleet, one hundred and ten ships, came to .\nTheir general and admiral was  son of , who traced his lineage from son to father through , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , to  who was the son of . He was of the second royal house.\nAll the aforesaid had been kings of , save the seven named first after . The general of the  was  son of .\n\n\nWhen all the ships had arrived at , there came to the  quarters messengers from the , the same who a little while before that had gone to  and entreated the  to free .\nOne of these was  the son of . These, who at first were seven, made a faction and conspired to slay , the tyrant of , but when their conspiracy became known, one of the accomplices having revealed their enterprise, the six who remained got them secretly out of , from where they went to  and now to , entreating the  to sail to .\nThe  took them as far as , and that not readily, for they, having no knowledge of those parts and thinking that armed men were everywhere, feared all that lay beyond. They supposed too that  was no nearer to them than the Pillars of . So it happened that the barbarians were too disheartened to dare to sail farther west than , while at the same time the  dared to go at the ' request no farther east than . It was fear which kept the middle space between them.\n\n\nThe , then, sailed to , and  wintered in . Having his headquarters there he sent a man of  called Mys to visit the places of divination, charging him to inquire of all the oracles which he could test. What it was that he desired to learn from the oracles when he gave this charge, I cannot say, for no one tells of it. I suppose that he sent to inquire concerning his present business, and that alone.\n\n\nThis man Mys is known to have gone to  and to have bribed a man of the country to go down into the cave of  and to have gone to the place of divination at  in . He went first to  where he inquired of  (sacrifice is there the way of divination, as at ), and moreover he bribed one who was no  but a stranger to lie down to sleep in the shrine of .\nNo  may seek a prophecy there, for  bade them by an oracle to choose which of the two they wanted and forgo the other, and take him either for their prophet or for their ally. They chose that he should be their ally. Therefore no  may lie down to sleep in that place.\n\n\nBut at this time there happened, as the  say, a thing at which I marvel greatly. It would seem that this man Mys of  came in his wanderings among the places of divination to the precinct of . This temple is called , and belongs to the . It lies by a hill, above lake , very near to the town .\nWhen the man called Mys entered into this temple together with three men of the town who were chosen on the state's behalf to write down the oracles that should be given, straightway the diviner prophesied in a foreign tongue.\nThe  who followed him were astonished to hear a strange language instead of  and knew not what this present matter might be. Mys of , however, snatched from them the tablet which they carried and wrote on it that which was spoken by the prophet, saying that the words of the oracle were . After writing everything down, he went back to .\n\n\n read whatever was said in the oracles, and presently he sent a messenger to , , a , son of . Him he sent, partly because the  were akin to him; , a , had taken to wife  's sister and ' daughter, who had borne to him that  of  who was called by the name of his mother's father, and to whom the king gave  a great city in  for his dwelling. Partly too he sent him because he learned that  was a protector and benefactor to the .\nIt was thus that he supposed he could best gain the  for his allies, of whom he heard that they were a numerous and valiant people, and knew that they had been the chief authors of the calamities which had befallen the  at sea.\nIf he gained their friendship he thought he would easily become master of the seas, as truly he would have been. On land he supposed himself to be by much the stronger, and he accordingly reckoned that thus he would have the upper hand of the . This chanced to be the prediction of the oracles which counseled him to make the  his ally. It was in obedience to this that he sent his messenger.\n\n\nThis  was seventh in descent from , who got for himself the tyranny of  in the way that I will show. Three brothers of the lineage of  came as banished men from  to ,  and  and ; and from  they crossed over into the highlands of  till they came to the town .\nThere they served for wages as thetes in the king's household, one tending horses and another oxen. , who was the youngest, tended the lesser flocks. Now the king's wife cooked their food for them, for in old times the ruling houses among men, and not the common people alone, were lacking in wealth.\nWhenever she baked bread, the loaf of the thete  grew double in size. Seeing that this kept happening, she told her husband, and it seemed to him when be heard it that this was a portent signifying some great matter. So he sent for his thetes and bade them depart from his territory.\nThey said it was only just that they should have their wages before they departed. When they spoke of wages, the king was moved to foolishness and said, That is the wage you merit, and it is that I give you, pointing to the sunlight that shone down the smoke vent into the house.\n\n and , who were the elder, stood astonished when they heard that, but the boy said, We accept what you give, O king, and with that he took a knife which he had with him and drew a line with it on the floor of the house round the sunlight. When he had done this, he three times gathered up the sunlight into the fold of his garment and went his way with his companions.\n\n\nSo they departed, but one of those who sat nearby declared to the king what this was that the boy had done and how it was of set purpose that the youngest of them had accepted the gift offered. When the king heard this, he was angered, and sent riders after them to slay them. There is, however, in that land a river, to which the descendants from  of these men offer sacrifice as their deliverer.\nThis river, when the sons of  had crossed it, rose in such flood that the riders could not cross. So the brothers came to another part of  and settled near the place called the garden of  son of , where roses grow of themselves, each bearing sixty blossoms and of surpassing fragrance.\nIn this garden, according to the  story,  was taken captive. Above it rises the mountain called , which none can ascend for the wintry cold. From there they issued forth when they had won that country and presently subdued also the rest of .\n\n\nFrom that   was descended, being the son of , who was the son of ; ' father was , and his was ; ' father was , and his again was , who won that lordship.\n\n\nSuch was the lineage of  son of . When he came to  from  who had sent him, he spoke as follows : This, , is what  says to you:there is a message come to me from the king, saying, I forgive the  all the offenses which they have committed against me;\n\nand now, , I bid you do this:Give them back their territory and let them choose more for themselves besides, where ever they will, and dwell under their own laws. Rebuild all their temples which I burnt, if they will make a pact with me. This is the message, and I must obey it (says ), unless you take it upon yourselves to hinder me.\nThis too I say to you:Why are you so insane as to wage war against the king? You cannot overcome him, nor can you resist him forever. As for the multitude of ' army, what it did, you have seen, and you have heard of the power that I now have with me. Even if you overcome and conquer us (whereof, if you be in your right minds, you can have no hope), yet there will come another host many times as great as this.\nBe not then minded to match yourselves against the king, and thereby lose your land and always be yourselves in jeopardy, but make peace. This you can most honorably do since the king is that way inclined. Keep your freedom, and agree to be our brothers in arms in all faith and honesty.\n\nThis , is the message which  charges me to give you. For my own part I will say nothing of the goodwill that I have towards you, for it would not be the first that you have learned of that. But I entreat you to follow ' counsel.\nWell I see that you will not have power to wage war against  forever. If I saw such power in you, I would never have come to you with such language as this, for the king's might is greater than human, and his arm is long.\nIf, therefore, you will not straightway agree with them, when the conditions which they offer you are so great, I fear what may befall you. For of all the allies you dwell most in the very path of the war, and you alone will never escape destruction, your country being marked out for a battlefield.\nNo, rather follow his counsel, for it is not to be lightly regarded by you who are the only men in  whose offenses the great king is ready to forgive and whose friend he would be.\n\n\nThese were the words of . The , however, had heard that  had come to  to bring the  to an agreement with the barbarian. Remembering the oracles, how that they themselves with the rest of the  must be driven out of the  by the  and the , they were greatly afraid that the  should agree with the , and they straightway resolved that they would send envoys.\nMoreover, it so fell out for both that they made their entry at one and the same time, for the  delayed and waited for them, being certain that the  were going to hear that the messenger had come from the  for an agreement. They had heard that the  would send their envoys with all speed. Therefore it was of set purpose that they did this in order that they might make their will known to the .\n\n\nSo when  had made an end of speaking, the envoys from  said, We on our part have been sent by the  to entreat you to do nothing harmful to  and accept no offer from the barbarian.\nThat would be unjust and dishonorable for any , but for you most of all, on many counts; it was you who stirred up this war, by no desire of ours, and your territory was first the stake of that battle in which all  is now engaged.\nApart from that, it is unbearable that not all this alone but slavery too should be brought upon the  by you , who have always been known as givers of freedom to many. Nevertheless, we grieve with you in your afflictions, seeing that you have lost two harvests and your substance has been for a long time wasted.\nIn requital for this the  and their allies declare that they will nourish your women and all of your household members who are unserviceable for war, so long as this war will last. Let not  the  win you with his smooth-tongued praise of ' counsel. It is his business to follow that counsel,\n\nfor as he is a tyrant so must he be the tyrant's fellow-worker; it is not your business, if you are men rightly minded, for you know that in foreigners there is no faith nor truth. These are the words of the envoys.\n\n\nBut to  the  replied as follows: We know of ourselves that the power of the  is many times greater than ours. There is no need to taunt us with that. Nevertheless in our zeal for freedom we will defend ourselves to the best of our ability. But as regards agreements with the barbarian, do not attempt to persuade us to enter into them, nor will we consent.\nNow carry this answer back to  from the , that as long as the sun holds the course by which he now goes, we will make no agreement with . We will fight against him without ceasing, trusting in the aid of the gods and the heroes whom he has disregarded and burnt their houses and their adornments.\nCome no more to  with such a plea, nor under the semblance of rendering us a service, counsel us to act wickedly. For we do not want those who are our friends and protectors to suffer any harm at  hands.\n\n\nSuch was their answer to , but to the  envoys they said, It was most human that the  should fear our making an agreement with the barbarian. We think that it is an ignoble thing to be afraid, especially since we know the  temper to be such that there is nowhere on earth such store of gold or such territory of surpassing fairness and excellence that the gift of it should win us to take the  part and enslave .\nFor there are many great reasons why we should not do this, even if we so desired; first and foremost, the burning and destruction of the adornments and temples of our gods, whom we are constrained to avenge to the utmost rather than make pacts with the perpetrator of these things, and next the kinship of all  in blood and speech, and the shrines of gods and the sacrifices that we have in common, and the likeness of our way of life, to all of which it would not befit the  to be false.\nKnow this now, if you knew it not before, that as long as one  is left alive we will make no agreement with . Nevertheless we thank you for your forethought concerning us, in that you have so provided for our wasted state that you offer to nourish our households.\nFor your part, you have given us full measure of kindness, yet for ourselves, we will make shift to endure as best we may, and not be burdensome to you. But now, seeing that this is so, send your army with all speed,\n\nfor as we guess, the barbarian will be upon us and invade our country in no long time as soon as the message comes to him that we will do nothing that he requires of us; therefore, before he comes into , now is the time for us to march first into . At this reply of the  the envoys returned back to ."}}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "9", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "1", "@unit": "section"}, {"@unit": "para"}, {"@n":

What he desired was to take  once more; this was partly out of mere perversity, and partly because he intended to signify to the king at  by a line of beacons across the islands that he held .\n\n When he came to , however, he found the city as unpopulated as before, for, as he learned, the majority of them were on shipboard at . So he took the city, but without any of its men. There were ten months between the kings taking of the place and the later invasion of .\n\n\nWhen  came to , he sent to  a certain , a man from , bearing the same offer as  the  had ferried across to the .\nHe sent this for the second time because although he already knew the ' unfriendly purpose, he expected that they would abandon their stubbornness now that  was the captive of his spear and lay at his mercy.\n\n\nFor this reason he sent  to  who came before the council and conveyed to them  message. Then , one of the councillors, said that it seemed best to him to receive the offer brought to them by  and lay it before the people.\nThis was the opinion which he declared, either because he had been bribed by , or because the plan pleased him. The  in the council were, however, very angry; so too were those outside when they heard of it. They made a ring round  and stoned him to death.  the , however, they permitted to depart unharmed.\nThere was much noise at  over the business of ; and when the  women learned what was afoot, one calling to another and bidding her follow, they went on their own impetus to the house of  and stoned to death his wife and his children.\n\n\nNow this was how the  had crossed over to . As long as they expected that the  army would come to their aid, they remained in . But when the  took longer and longer to act and the invader was said to be in  already, they then conveyed all their goods out of harms way and themselves crossed over to . They also sent envoys to , who were to upbraid the  for permitting the barbarian to invade  and not helping the  to meet him in ; and who were to remind the  of the promises which the  had made to  if she would change sides, and warn them that the  would devise some means of salvation for themselves if the  sent them no help.\n\n\nThe  were at this time celebrating the festival of , and their chief concern was to give the god his due; moreover, the wall which they were building on the Isthmus was by now getting its battlements. When the  envoys arrived in , bringing with them envoys from  and , they came before the ephors and said:\n\n\nThe  have sent us with this message: the king of the  is ready to give us back our country, and to make us his confederates, equal in right and standing, in all honor and honesty, and to give us whatever land we ourselves may choose besides our own.\nBut we, since we do not want to sin against  the god of  and think it shameful to betray , have not consented. This we have done despite the fact that the  are dealing with us wrongfully and betraying us to our hurt; furthermore, we know that it is more to our advantage to make terms with the  than to wage war with him, yet we will not make terms with him of our own free will. For our part, we act honestly by the ;\n\n\nbut what of you, who once were in great dread lest we should make terms with the ? Now that you have a clear idea of our sentiments and are sure that we will never betray , and now that the wall which you are building across the Isthmus is nearly finished, you take no account of the , but have deserted us despite all your promises that you would withstand the  in , and have permitted the barbarian to march into .\nFor the present, then, the  are angry with you since you have acted in a manner unworthy of you. Now they ask you to send with us an army with all speed, so that we may await the foreigner's onset in ; since we have lost , in our own territory the most suitable place for a battle is the  plain.\n\n\nWhen the ephors heard that, they delayed answering till the next day, and again till the day after. This they did for ten days, putting it off from day to day. In the meantime all the  were doing all they could to fortify the Isthmus, and they had nearly completed the task.\nI cannot say for certain why it was that when  the  came to  the  insisted that the  should not join the side of the , yet now took no account of that; it may be that with the Isthmus fortified, they thought they had no more need of the , whereas when  came to , their wall was not yet built and they were working at this in great fear of the .\n\n\nThe nature of their response was as follows: on the day before the final hearing of the  delegation, , a man of , who had more authority with the  than any other of their guests, learned from the ephors all that the  had said.\nUpon hearing this he, as the tale goes, said to the ephors, Sirs, if the  are our enemies and the barbarians allies, then although you push a strong wall across the Isthmus, a means of access into the  lies wide open for the . No, give heed to what they say before the  take some new resolve which will bring calamity to .\n\n\nThis was the counsel he gave the ephors, who straightway took it to heart. Without saying a word to the envoys who had come from the cities, they ordered five thousand  to march before dawn. Seven helots were appointed to attend each of them, and they gave the command to  son of .\nThe leader's place rightfully belonged to  son of , but he was still a boy, and  his guardian and cousin. , ' father and ' son, was no longer living.\nAfter he led the army which had built the wall away from the Isthmus, he lived but a little while before his death. The reason for  leading his army away from the Isthmus was that while he was offering sacrifice for victory over the , the sun was darkened in the heavens.  chose as his colleague a man of the same family,  son of .\n\n\nSo ' army had marched away from ; but as soon as it was day, the envoys came before the ephors, having no knowledge of the expedition, and being minded themselves too to depart each one to his own place. When they arrived, You , they said, remain where you are, observing your  and celebrating, leaving your allies deserted. For the wrong that you do them and for lack of allies, the , will make their peace with the  as best they can,\n\nand thereafter, in so far as we will be king's allies, we will march with him against whatever land his men lead us. Then will you learn what the issue of this matter will be for you. In response to this the ephors swore to them that they believed their army to be even now at , marching against the strangers, as they called the barbarians.\nHaving no knowledge of this, the envoys questioned them further as to the meaning of this and thereby learned the whole truth; they marvelled at this and hastened with all speed after the army. With them went five thousand men-at-arms of the  countrymen.\n\n\nSo they made haste to reach the Isthmus. The , however, had already promised  that they would prevent the  from going out to war. As soon as they were informed that  and his army had departed from , they sent as their herald to  the swiftest runner of long distances whom they could find.\nWhen he came to , he spoke to  in the following manner: I have been sent by the  to tell you that the young men have gone out from  to war, and that the  cannot prevent them from so doing; therefore, make plans accordingly.\n\n\nSo spoke the herald, and went back again. When  heard that, he no longer desired to remain in . Before he had word of it, he had held his land, desiring to know the ' plan and what they would do; he neither harmed nor harried the land of , for he still supposed that they would make terms with him.\nBut when he could not prevail upon them and learned the truth of the matter, he withdrew before ' army prior to its entering the Isthmus. First, however, he burnt , and utterly overthrew and demolished whatever wall or house or temple was left standing.\nThe reason for his marching away was that  was not a land fit for horses, and if he should be defeated in a battle, there was no way of retreat save one so narrow that a few men could prevent his passage. He therefore planned to retreat to  and do battle where he had a friendly city at his back and ground suitable for horsemen.\n\n\nSo  drew his men off, and when he had now set forth on his road there came a message that in addition to the others, an advance guard of a thousand  had arrived at . When he heard this, he deliberated how he might first make an end of these. He accordingly turned about and led his army against , his cavalry going first and overrunning the lands of that city. That was the westernmost place in  which this  army reached.\n\n\nPresently there came a message to  that the  were gathered together on the Isthmus. Thereupon he marched back again through ; the rulers of  sent for those of the  country who lived nearby, and these guided him to  and from there to .\nHere he camped for the night, and on the next day he turned from there to , where he was in  territory. There he laid waste the lands of the , though they sided with the  part. This he did, not for any ill-will that he bore them, but because sheer necessity drove him to make a stronghold for his army and to have this for a refuge if the fortune of battle were other than he wished.\nHis army, stationed along the , covered the ground from  past  and up to the lands of . I do not mean to say that the walled camp which he made was of this size; each side of it was of a length of about ten furlongs.\n\n\nWhile the barbarians were engaged in this task,  son of , a , made great preparations and invited  with fifty who were the most notable of the  to be his guests at a banquet. They came as they were bidden; the dinner was held at . What follows was told me by  of , one of the most notable men of that place.  too (he said) was invited to this dinner, and fifty  in addition.  made them sit, not each man by himself but on each couch a  and a  together.\nNow as they were drinking together after dinner, the  who sat with him asked  in the  tongue from what country he was.  answered that he was from . Then said the : Since you have eaten at the board with me and drunk with me afterwards, I would like to leave a memorial of my belief, so that you yourself may have such knowledge as to take fitting counsel for your safety.\nDo you see these  at the banquet and that host which we left encamped by the river side? In a little while you shall see but a small remnant left alive of all these. As he said this, the  wept bitterly.\nMarvelling at these words,  answered: Must you not then tell this to  and those honorable  who are with him? Sir, said the , that which a god wills to send no man can turn aside, for even truth sometimes finds no one to believe it.\nWhat I have said is known to many of us , but we follow, in the bonds of necessity. It is the most hateful thing for a person to have much knowledge and no power. This tale I heard from  of  who told me in addition that he had straightway told this to others before the battle of .\n\n\nSo  was making his encampment in . All the  of that region who sided with the  furnished fighting men, and they joined with him in his attack upon , with the exception of the ; as for taking the  side, that they did right away, though from necessity rather than willingly.\nA few days after the ' coming to , a thousand  men-at-arms under the leadership of , the most notable of their countrymen, arrived. When these men too were in ,  sent horsemen and bade the  take their station on the plain by themselves.\nWhen they had done so, the whole of the  cavalry appeared, and presently word was spread through all of the  army which was with , and likewise among the  themselves, that  would shoot them to death with javelins.\nThen their general  exhorted them: Men of , he said, seeing that death at these fellows' hands is staring us in the face (we being, as I surmise, maligned by the ), it is now time for every one of you to be noble; for it is better to end our lives in action and fighting than tamely to suffer a shameful death. No, rather we will teach them that they whose slaying they have devised are men of . Thus he exhorted them.\n\n\nBut when the horsemen had encircled the , they rode at them as if to slay them, and drew their bows to shoot; it is likely too that some did in fact shoot. The  opposed them in every possible way, drawing in together and closing their ranks to the best of their power. At this the horsemen wheeled about and rode back and away.\nNow I cannot with exactness say whether they came at the ' desire to slay the , but when they saw the men preparing to defend themselves, they feared lest they themselves should suffer some hurt, and so rode away (for such was ' command),or if  wanted to test the ' mettle.\nWhen the horsemen had ridden away,  sent a herald, with this message: Men of , be of good courage, for you have shown yourselves to be valiant men, and not as it was reported to me. Now push this war zealously forward, for you will outdo neither myself nor the king in the rendering of service. This is how the matter of the  turned out.\n\n\nAs for the , when they had come to the Isthmus, they encamped there. When the rest of the  who chose the better cause heard that, seeing the  setting forth to war, they thought that they should not lag behind the  in so doing.\nAccordingly, they all marched from the Isthmus (the omens of sacrifice being favorable) and came to . When they had offered sacrifice there also and the omens were favorable, they continued their march, having now the  with them, who had crossed over from  and joined with them at .\nWhen they came (as it is said) to  in , they learned that the barbarians were encamped by the . Taking note of that, they arrayed themselves opposite the enemy on the lower hills of .\n\n\nWhen the  did not come down into the plain,  sent against them his entire cavalry, whose commander was  (whom the  call ), a man much honored among the ; he rode a  horse which had a golden bit and was elaborately adorned all over. Thereupon the horsemen rode up to the  and charged them by squadrons; as they attacked, they did them much hurt, and called them women all the while.\n\n\nNow it chanced that the  were posted in that part of the field which was most open to attack, and here the horsemen found the readiest approach. Therefore, being hard-pressed by the charges, the  sent a herald to the generals of the , who came to them and spoke as follows :\n\nFrom the men of  to their allies: we cannot alone withstand the  cavalry (although we have till now held our ground with patience and valor, despite the fact that we were hard-pressed) in the position to which we were first appointed. Know that now we will abandon our post, unless you send others to take our place there.\nThis the herald reported, and  inquired among the  if any would offer to go to that place and relieve the  by holding the post. All the others did not want to, but the  took it upon themselves, that is three hundred picked men of , whose captain was  son of .\n\n\nThose who volunteered themselves, were posted at  in front of the whole  army, and they took with them the archers also. They fought for a long time and the end of the battle was as I will now tell. The cavalry charged by squadrons, and ' horse, being at the head of the rest, was struck in the side by an arrow. Rearing up in pain, it threw ,\n\nwho when he fell, was straightaway set upon by the . His horse they took then and there, and he himself was killed fighting. They could not, however, kill him at first, for he was outfitted in the following manner: he wore a purple tunic over a cuirass of golden scales which was within it; thus they accomplished nothing by striking at the cuirass, until someone saw what was happening and stabbed him in the eye. Then he collapsed and died.\nBut as chance would have it, the rest of the horsemen knew nothing of this, for they had not seen him fall from his horse, or die. They wheeled about and rode back without perceiving what was done. As soon as they halted, however, they saw what they were missing since there was no one to give them orders. Then when they perceived what had occurred, they gave each other the word, and all rode together to recover the dead body.\n\n\nWhen the  saw the horsemen riding at them, not by squadrons as before, but all together, they cried to the rest of the army for help. While all their infantry was rallying to aid, there was a bitter fight over the dead body.\nAs long as the three hundred stood alone, they had the worst of the battle by far, and were ready to leave the dead man. When the main body came to their aid, then it was the horsemen who could no longer hold their ground, nor help to recover the dead man, but rather lost others of their comrades in addition to . They accordingly withdrew and halted about two furlongs away, where they deliberated what they should do. Since there was no one to give them orders, they resolved to report to .\n\n\nWhen the cavalry returned to camp,  and the whole army mourned deeply for , cutting their own hair and the hair of their horses and beasts of burden, and lamenting loudly; the sound of this was heard over all , for a man was dead who, next to , was most esteemed by all  and the king.\n\n\nSo the barbarians honored ' death in their customary way, but the  were greatly encouraged that they withstood and drove off the charging horsemen. First they laid the dead man on a cart and carried him about their ranks, and the body was well worth seeing, because of its stature and grandeur; therefore, they would even leave their ranks and come to view .\nPresently they resolved that they would march down to , for they saw that the ground there was generally more suited for encampment than that at , and chiefly because it was better watered. It was to this place and to the  spring which was there, that they resolved to go and pitch camp in their several battalions;\nThey took up their arms and marched along the lower slopes of  past  to the lands of , and when they arrived, they arrayed themselves nation by nation near the  spring and the precinct of the hero , among low hills and in a level country.\n\n\nDuring the drawing up of battle formation there arose much dispute between the  and the , for each of them claimed that they should hold the second wing of the army, justifying themselves by tales of deeds new and old.\nFirst the  spoke: We, among all the allies, have always had the right to hold this position in all campaigns, of the united  armies, both ancient and recent, ever since that time when the  after ' death attempted to return to the .\nWe gained because of the achievement which we will relate. When we marched out at the Isthmus for war, along with the  and  who then dwelt in the , and encamped opposite the returning exiles, then (it is said)  announced that army should not be risked against army in battle, but that that champion in the host of the  whom they chose as their best should fight with him in single combat on agreed conditions.\nThe , resolving that this should be so, swore a compact that if  should overcome the  champion, the  should return to the land of their fathers, but if he were himself beaten, then the  should depart and lead their army away, not attempting to return to the  until a hundred years had passed.\nThen our general and king , son of ' son , volunteered and was chosen out of all the allied host; he fought that duel and killed . It was for that feat of arms that the  granted us this in addition to other great privileges which we have never ceased to possess, namely that in all united campaigns we should always lead the army's second wing.\nNow with you, men of , we have no rivalry, but forbear and bid you choose the command of whichever wing you want. We do, however, say that our place is at the head of the other, as it has always been. Quite apart from that feat which we have related, we are worthier than the  to hold that post,\n\nfor we have fought many battles which turned out favorably for you, men of , and others besides. It is accordingly we and not the  who should hold the second wing, for neither at some earlier period nor recently, have they achieved such feats of arms as we.\n\n\nTo these words the  replied: It is our belief that we are gathered for battle with the barbarian, and not for speeches; but since the man of  has made it his business to speak of all the valorous deeds, old and new, which either of our nations has at any time achieved, we must prove to you how we, rather than , have by virtue of our valor a hereditary right to the place of honor. These  say that they killed the leader of the  at the Isthmus.\nNow when those same  had been rejected by every  people to whom they resorted to escape the tyranny of the , we alone received them. With them we vanquished those who then inhabited the , and we broke the pride of .\nFurthermore, when the  who had marched with  against  had there made an end of their lives and lay unburied, know that we sent our army against the  and recovered the dead and buried them in .\nWe also have on record our great victory against the , who once came from the river  and broke into , and in the hard days of  we were second to none. But since it is useless to recall these mattersfor those who were previously valiant may now be of lesser mettle, and those who lacked mettle then may be better men now\n\nenough of the past. Supposing that we were known for no achievement (although the fact is that we have done more than any other of the ), we nevertheless deserve to have this honor and more beside because of the role we played at Marathon, seeing that alone of all  we met the  singlehandedly and did not fail in that enterprise, but overcame forty-six nations.\nIs it not then our right to hold this post, for that one feat alone? Yet seeing that this is no time for wrangling about our place in the battle, we are ready to obey you, men of  and take whatever place and face whatever enemy you think fitting. Wherever you set us, we will strive to be valiant men. Command us then, knowing that we will obey.\n\nThis was the ' response, and the whole army shouted aloud that the  were worthier to hold the wing than the . It was in this way that the  were preferred to the men of , and gained that place.\n\nPresently the whole  army was arrayed as I will show, both the later and the earliest comers. On the right wing were ten thousand ; five thousand of these, who were , had a guard of thirty-five thousand light-armed helots, seven appointed for each man.\nThe  chose the  for their neighbors in the battle, both to do them honor, and for their valor; there were of these fifteen hundred men-at-arms. Next to these in the line were five thousand , at whose desire  permitted the three hundred  from  then present to stand by them.\nNext to these were six hundred  from , and after them three thousand men of . By these one thousand  were posted, and after them two hundred men of , then four hundred from  and , and next to them one thousand from . By these stood three hundred men of .\nNext to the men of  were six hundred  and ; next to them, four hundred ; next again, five hundred . After these stood eight hundred  and , and next to them two hundred from  in ;\n\nafter them in the array, five hundred ; by them stood three thousand men of , and next to these six hundred . At the end, and first in the line, were the  who held the left wing. They were eight thousand in number, and their general was  son of .\n\n\nAll these, except the seven appointed to attend each , were men-at-arms, and the whole sum of them was thirty-eight thousand and seven hundred. This was the number of men-at-arms that mustered for war against the barbarian; as regards the number of the light-armed men, there were in the  array seven for each man-at-arms, that is, thirty-five thousand, and every one of these was equipped for war.\nThe light-armed from the rest of  and  were as one to every man-at-arms, and their number was thirty-four thousand and five hundred.\n\n\nSo the total of all the light-armed men who were fighters was sixty-nine thousand and five hundred, and of the whole  army mustered at , men-at-arms and light-armed fighting men together, eleven times ten thousand less eighteen hundred. The  who were present were one hundred and ten thousand in number, for the survivors of the  were also present with the army, eighteen hundred in number. These then were arrayed and encamped by the .\n\n\nWhen ' barbarians had finished their mourning for  and heard that the  were at , they also came to the part of the  nearest to them. When they were there, they were arrayed for battle by  as I shall show. He posted the  facing the .\nSeeing that the  by far outnumbered the , they were arrayed in deeper ranks and their line ran opposite the  also. In his arraying of them he chose out the strongest part of the  to set it over against the , and posted the weaker by them facing the ; this he did being so informed and taught by the .\nNext to the  he posted the  opposite the men of , , , and ; next to the , the , opposite the men of , , , , , and .\nAfter the  he set the , opposite the men of  and  and  and . Next to the  he posted the , opposite the , , , , and ;\n\nnext to the , and opposite the , , , the , , , , and the thousand that came from ; for not all the  took the  side, but some of them gave their aid to the  cause; these had been besieged on , and issued out from there to harry ' army and the  who were with him. Beside these, he arrayed the  also and those who lived in the area of  opposite the .\n\n\nThese which I have named were the greatest of the nations set in array by , but there was also in the army a mixture of , , , , and the rest, besides  and the  swordsmen called  and , who are the only fighting men in .\nThese had been fighters on shipboard, till  while yet at  disembarked them from their ships; for the  were not appointed to serve in the land army which  led to . Of the barbarians, then, there were three hundred thousand, as I have already shown. As for the  allies of , no one knows the number of them (for they were not counted), I suppose them to have been mustered to the number of fifty thousand. These were the footmen that were set in array; the cavalry were separately ordered.\n\n\nOn the second day after they had all been arrayed according to their nations and their battalions, both armies offered sacrifice. It was  who sacrificed for the , for he was with their army as a diviner; he was an  by birth, a  of the  clan, and the  gave him the freedom of their city.\nThis they did, for when  was inquiring of the oracle at  concerning offspring, the priestess prophesied to him that he should win five great victories. Not understanding that oracle, he engaged in bodily exercise, thinking that he would then be able to win in similar sports. When he had trained himself for the Five Contests, he came within one wrestling bout of winning the  prize, in a match with  of .\nThe , however, perceived that the oracle given to  spoke of the lists not of sport but of war, and they attempted to bribe  to be a leader in their wars jointly with their kings of ' line.\nWhen he saw that the  set great store by his friendship, he set his price higher, and made it known to them that he would do what they wanted only in exchange for the gift of full citizenship and all of the citizen's rights.\nHearing that, the  at first were angry and completely abandoned their request; but when the dreadful menace of this  host hung over them, they consented and granted his demand. When he saw their purpose changed, he said that he would not be content with that alone; his brother  too must be made a  on the same terms as himself.\n\n\nBy so saying he imitated , in so far as one may compare demands for kingship with those for citizenship. For when the women of  had gone mad, and the  wanted him to come from  and heal them of that madness,  demanded half of their kingship for his wages.\nThis the  would not put up with and departed. When, however, the madness spread among their women, they promised what  demanded and were ready to give it to him. Thereupon, seeing their purpose changed, he demanded yet more and said that he would not do their will except if they gave a third of their kingship to his brother ; now driven into dire straits, the  consented to that also.\n\n\nThe  too were so eagerly desirous of winning  that they granted everything that he demanded. When they had granted him this also,  of , now a , engaged in divination for them and aided them to win five very great victories. No one on earth save  and his brother ever became citizens of .\nNow the five victories were these: one, the first, this victory at ; next, that which was won at  over the  and ; after that, over all the  save the  at ; next, over the  at ; lastly, the victory at  over the  and , which was the last won of the five victories.\n\n\nThis  had now been brought by the  and was the diviner of the  at . The sacrifices boded good to the  if they would just defend themselves, but evil if they should cross the  and be the first to attack.\n\n\n' sacrifices also foretold an unfavorable outcome if he should be zealous to attack first, and good if he should but defend himself. He too used the  manner of sacrifice, and  of  was his diviner, the most notable of the sons of . This man had been put in prison and condemned to die by the  for the great harm which he had done them.\nBeing in such bad shape inasmuch as he was in peril of his life and was likely to be very grievously maltreated before his death, he did something which was almost beyond belief; made fast in iron-bound stocks, he got an iron weapon which was brought in some way into his prison, and straightway conceived a plan of such courage as we have never known; reckoning how best the rest of it might get free, he cut off his own foot at the instep.\nThis done, he tunneled through the wall out of the way of the guards who kept watch over him, and so escaped to . All night he journeyed, and all day he hid and lay hidden in the woods, till on the third night he came to , while all the people of  sought him. The latter were greatly amazed when they saw the half of his foot which had been cut off and lying there but not were unable to find the man himself.\nThis, then, is the way in which he escaped the  and took refuge in , which at that time was unfriendly to . After he was healed and had made himself a foot of wood, he declared himself an open enemy of the . Yet the enmity which he bore them brought him no good at the last, for they caught him at his divinations in  and killed him.\n\n\nThe death of , however, took place after the  business. At the present he was by the , hired by  for no small wage, where he sacrificed and worked zealously, both for the hatred he bore the  and for gain.\nWhen no favorable omens for battle could be won either by the  themselves or by the  who were with them (for they too had a diviner of their own,  of ), and the  kept flocking in and their army grew,  son of , a , advised  to guard the outlet of the pass over , telling him that the  were coming in daily and that he would thereby cut off many of them.\n\n\nThe armies had already lain hidden opposite each other for eight days when he gave this counsel.  perceived that the advice was good, and when night had fallen, he sent his horsemen to the outlet of the pass over  which leads towards . This pass the  call the , and the  the . The horsemen who were sent out did not go in vain,\n\nfor they caught both five hundred beasts of burden which were going into the low country, bringing provisions from the  for the army, and men who came with the wagons. When they had taken this quarry, the  killed without mercy, sparing neither man nor beast. When they had their fill of slaughter, they encircled the rest and drove them to  and his camp.\n\n\nAfter this deed they waited two days more, neither side desiring to begin the battle, for although the barbarians came to the  to test the  intent, neither army crossed it. ' cavalry, however, kept pressing upon and troubling the , for the , in their zeal for the  part, waged war heartily, and kept on guiding the horsemen to the encounter; thereafter it was the turn of the  and , and they and none other would do deeds of valor.\n\n\nUntil ten days had passed, no more was done than this. On the eleventh day from their first encampment opposite each other, the  growing greatly in number and  being greatly vexed by the delay, there was a debate held between  son of  and  son of , who stood as high as only few others in ' esteem.\nTheir opinions in council were as I will show.  thought it best that they should strike their camp with all speed and lead the whole army within the walls of . Here there was much food stored and fodder for their beasts of burden; furthermore, they could sit at their ease here and conclude the business by doing as follows:\n\nthey could take the great store they had of gold, minted and other, and silver drinking-cups, and send all this to all places in  without stint, excepting none, but especially to the chief men in the cities of . Let them do this (he said) and the  would quickly surrender their liberty; but do not let the  risk the event of a battle.\nThis opinion of his was the same as the , inasmuch as he too had special foreknowledge. ' counsel, however, was more vehement and intemperate and not at all leaning to moderation. He said that he thought that their army was much stronger than the  and that they should give battle with all speed so as not to let more  muster than were mustered already. As for the sacrifices of , let them pay no heed to these, nor seek to wring good from them, but rather give battle after  custom.\n\n\nNo one withstood this argument, and his opinion accordingly prevailed; for it was he and not  who was commander of the army by the king's commission. He therefore sent for the leaders of the battalions and the generals of those  who were with him and asked them if they knew any oracle which prophesied that the  should perish in .\nThose who were summoned said nothing, some not knowing the prophecies, and some knowing them but thinking it perilous to speak, and then  himself said: Since you either have no knowledge or are afraid to declare it, hear what I tell you based on the full knowledge that I have.\nThere is an oracle that  are fated to come to  and all perish there after they have plundered the temple at . Since we have knowledge of this same oracle, we will neither approach that temple nor attempt to plunder it; in so far as destruction hinges on that, none awaits us.\nTherefore, as many of you as wish the  well may rejoice in that we will overcome the . Having spoken in this way, he gave command to have everything prepared and put in good order for the battle which would take place early the next morning.\n\n\nNow for this prophecy, which  said was spoken of the , I know it to have been made concerning not them but the  and the army of the . There is, however, a prophecy made by  concerning this battle:\n\n\n\n\nI know that these verses and others very similar to them from  referred to the . As for the river , it flows between  and .\n\n\nAfter this inquiry about oracles and ' exhortation, night fell, and the armies posted their sentries. Now when the night was far advanced and it seemed that all was still in the camps and the men were sleeping deeply, at that hour  son of , the general and king of the , rode up to the  outposts and wanted to speak to their generals.\n\n The greater part of the sentries remained where they were, but the rest ran to their generals and told them that a horseman had ridden in from the  camp, imparting no other word save that he desired to speak to the generals and called them by their names.\n\n\nHearing that, the generals straightway went with the men to the outposts. When they had come,  said to them: Men of , I give you this message in trust as a secret which you must reveal to no one but , or else you will be responsible for my undoing. In truth I would not tell it to you if I did not care so much for all ;\nI myself am by ancient descent a , and I would not willingly see  change her freedom for slavery. I tell you, then, that  and his army cannot get omens to his liking from the sacrifices. Otherwise you would have fought long before this. Now, however, it is his purpose to pay no heed to the sacrifices, and to attack at the first glimmer of dawn, for he fears, as I surmise, that your numbers will become still greater. Therefore, I urge you to prepare, and if (as may be)  should delay and not attack, wait patiently where you are; for he has but a few days' provisions left.\nIf, however, this war ends as you wish, then must you take thought how to save me too from slavery, who have done so desperate a deed as this for the sake of  in my desire to declare to you ' intent so that the barbarians may not attack you suddenly before you yet expect them. I who speak am  the . With that he rode away back to the camp and his own station there.\n\n\nThe  generals went to the right wing and told  what they had heard from . At the message  was terrified by the , and said:\n\nSince, therefore, the battle is to begin at dawn, it is best that you  should take your stand opposite the , and we opposite the  and the  who are posted opposite you; for you have fought with the  at Marathon and know them and their manner of fighting while we have no experience or knowledge of those men. We  have experience of the  and , but not one of us has experience with the .\nNo, rather let us take up our equipment and change places, you to this wing and we to the left. We, too, the  answered, even from the moment when we saw the  posted opposite you, had it in mind to make that suggestion which now has first come from you. We feared, however, that we would displease you by making it. But since you have spoken the wish yourselves, we too hear your words very gladly and are ready to do as you say.\n\n\nSince both were satisfied with this, they exchanged their places in the ranks at the first light of dawn. The  noticed that and made it known to . When he heard this, he straight away attempted to make a change for himself also, by moving the  opposite the . When  perceived what was being done, he saw that his action had been discovered and led the  back to the right wing;  did the same thing on the left of his army.\n\n\nWhen all were at their former posts again,  sent a herald to the  with this message: Men of , you are said by the people of these parts to be very brave men. It is their boast of you that you neither flee from the field nor leave your post, but remain there and either slay your enemies or are yourselves killed. It would seem, however, that there is no truth in all this,\n\nfor before we could attack and fight hand to hand, we saw you even now fleeing and leaving your station, using  for the first trial of your enemy and arraying yourselves opposite those who are but our slaves.\nThis is not the action of brave men. No, we have been grievously mistaken about you, for in accordance with what we heard about you, we expected that you would send us a herald challenging the  and none other to fight with you. That we were ready to do; but we find you making no such offer, but rather quailing before us. Now, therefore, since the challenge comes not from you, take it from us instead.\nWhat is there to prevent us from fighting with equal numbers on both sides, you for the  (since you have the reputation of being their best), and we for the barbarians? If it is desirable that the others fight also, let them fight after us, but if, on the contrary the opinion prevails that we alone suffice, then let us fight it out. Let the winner in this contest determine victory for the whole army.\n\n\nThis is the proclamation made by the herald; and when he had waited a while and no one answered him, he went back again, and at his return told what had happened to him.  was overjoyed and proud of this semblance of victory, and sent his cavalry to attack the .\nThe horsemen rode at them and shot arrows and javelins among the whole  army to its great hurt, since they were mounted archers and difficult to deal with in an encounter; they spoiled and blocked the  spring, from which the entire  army drew its water.\nNone indeed but the  were posted near the spring, and it was far from the several stations of the other , whereas the  was near; nevertheless, they would always go to the spring, since they were barred from the , not being able to draw water from that river because of the horsemen and the arrows.\n\n\nWhen this happened, seeing that their army was cut off from water and thrown into confusion by the horsemen, the generals of the  went to  on the right wing, and debated concerning this and other matters; for there were other problems which troubled them more than what I have told. They had no food left, and their followers whom they had sent into the  to bring provisions had been cut off by the horsemen and could not make their way to the army.\n\n\nSo they resolved in their council that if the  held off through that day from giving battle, they would go to the Island. This is ten furlongs distant from the  and the  spring, near which their army then lay, and in front of the town of .\nIt is like an island on dry land because the river in its course down from  into the plain is parted into two channels, and there is about three furlongs space in between till presently the two channels unite again, and the name of that river is , who (as the people of the country say ) was the daughter of .\nTo that place then they planned to go so that they might have plenty of water for their use and not be harmed by the horsemen, as now when they were face to face with them; and they resolved to change places in the second watch of the night, lest the  should see them setting forth and the horsemen press after them and throw them into confusion.\nFurthermore, they resolved that when they had come to that place, which is encircled by the divided channels of ' daughter  as she flows from , they would in that night send half of their army to , to remove their followers who had gone to get the provisions; for these were cut off from them on .\n\n\nHaving made this plan, all that day they suffered constant hardship from the cavalry which continually pressed upon them. When the day ended, however, and the horsemen stopped their onslaught, then at that hour of the night at which it was agreed that they should depart, most of them rose and departed, not with intent to go to the place upon which they had agreed. Instead of that, once they were on their way, they joyfully shook off the horsemen and escaped to the town of . In the course of their flight they came to the temple of  which is outside of that town, twenty furlongs distant from the  spring and piled their arms in front of the temple.\n\n\nSo they encamped around the temple of . , however, seeing their departure from the camp, gave orders to the  to take up their arms likewise and follow the others who had gone ahead, supposing that these were making for the place where they had agreed to go.\nThereupon, all the rest of the captains being ready to obey ,  son of , the leader of the  battalion, refused to flee from the barbarians or (save by compulsion) bring shame on ; the whole business seemed strange to him, for he had not been present in the council recently held.\n\n and  were outraged that  disobeyed them. Still more, however, they disliked that his refusing would compel them to abandon the  battalion, for they feared that if they fulfilled their agreement with the rest of the  and abandoned him,  and his men would be left behind to perish.\nBearing this in mind, they kept the  army where it was and tried to persuade  that he was in the wrong.\n\n\nSo they reasoned with , he being the only man left behind of all the  and . As for the , they stood unmoved at their post, well aware that the purposes and the promises of  were not alike.\nBut when the army left its station, they sent a horseman of their own to see whether the  were attempting to march or whether they were not intending to depart, and to ask  what the  should do.\n\n\nWhen the messenger arrived among the , he saw them arrayed where they had been, and their chief men by now in hot dispute. For though  and  reasoned with , that the  should not be endangered by remaining there alone, they could in no way prevail upon him. At last, when the  messenger came among them, angry words began to pass.\nIn this wrangling  took up a stone with both hands and threw it down before ' feet, crying that it was the pebble with which he voted against fleeing from the strangers (meaning thereby the barbarians).  called him a madman; then when the  messenger asked the question with which he had been charged,  asked the man to tell the  of his present condition, and begged them to join themselves to the  and, as for departure, to do as they did.\n\n\nThe messenger then went back to the . When dawn found the dispute still continuing, , who had up to this point kept his army where it was, now gave the word and led all the rest away between the hillocks, the  following, for he supposed that  would not stay behind when the rest of the  left him; this was in fact exactly what happened.\nThe  marshalled themselves and marched, but not by the same way as the , who stayed close to the broken ground and the lower slopes of  in order to stay clear of the  horse. The  marched down into the plain instead.\n\n\nNow  at first supposed that  would never have the heart to leave him and his men, and he insisted that they should remain where they were and not leave their post. When ' men had already proceeded some distance, he thought that they had really left him. He accordingly bade his battalion take up its arms and led it in marching step after the rest of the column,\n\nwhich after going a distance of ten furlongs, was waiting for  by the stream  and the place called , where there is a shrine of . The reason for their waiting was that, if  and his battalion should not leave the place where it was posted but remain there, they would then be able to assist him.\nNo sooner had ' men come up than the barbarians' cavalry attacked the army, for the horsemen acted as they always had. When they saw no enemy on the ground where the  had been on the days before this, they kept riding forward and attacked the  as soon as they overtook them.\n\n\nWhen  learned that the  had departed under cover of night and saw the ground deserted, he called to him  of  and his brothers  and  and said:\n\nWhat will you say now, sons of , when you see this place deserted? For you, who are their neighbors, kept telling me that  fled from no battlefield and were the masters of warfare. These same men, however, you just saw changing their post, and now you and all of us see that they have fled during the night. The moment they had to measure themselves in battle with those that are in very truth the bravest on earth, they plainly showed that they are men of no account, and all other  likewise.\nNow you, for your part, were strangers to the , and I could readily pardon you for praising these fellows, who were in some sort known to you; but I marvelled much more that , be he ever so frightened, should give us a coward's advice to strike our camp, and march away to be besieged in . Of this advice the king will certainly hear from me, but it will be discussed elsewhere.\nNow we must not permit our enemies to do as they want; they must be pursued till they are overtaken and pay the penalty for all the harm they have done the .\n\n\nWith that, he led the  with all speed across the  in pursuit of the , supposing that they were in flight; it was the army of  and  alone which was his goal, for the  marched another way over the broken ground, and were out of his sight.\nSeeing the  setting forth in pursuit of the , the rest of the barbarian battalions straightway raised their standards and also gave pursuit, each at top speed, no battalion having order in its ranks nor place assigned in the line.\n\n\nSo they ran pell-mell and shouting, as though they would utterly make an end of the . , however, when the cavalry attacked him, sent a horseman to the  with this message: Men of , in this great contest which must give freedom or slavery to , we  and you  have been betrayed by the flight of our allies in the night that is past.\nI have accordingly now resolved what we must do; we must protect each other by fighting as best we can. If the cavalry had attacked you first, it would have been the duty of both ourselves and the , who are faithful to , to aid you; but now, seeing that the whole brunt of their assault falls on us, it is right that you should come to the aid of that division which is hardest pressed.\nBut if, as may be, anything has befallen you which makes it impossible for you to aid us, do us the service of sending us your archers. We are sure that you will obey us, as knowing that you have been by far more zealous than all others in this present war.\n\n\nWhen the  heard that, they attempted to help the  and defend them with all their might. But when their march had already begun, they were set upon by the  posted opposite them, who had joined themselves to the king. For this reason, being now under attack by the foe which was closest, they could at the time send no aid.\nThe  and  accordingly stood alone, men-at-arms and light-armed together; there were of the  fifty thousand and of the , who had never been parted from the , three thousand. These offered sacrifice so that they would fare better in battle with  and the army which was with him.\nThey could get no favorable omen from their sacrifices, and in the meanwhile many of them were killed and by far more wounded (for the  set up their shields for a fence, and shot showers of arrows). Since the  were being hard-pressed and their sacrifices were of no avail,  lifted up his eyes to the temple of  at  and called on the goddess, praying that they might not be disappointed in their hope.\n\n\nWhile he was still in the act of praying, the men of  leapt out before the rest and charged the barbarians, and immediately after ' prayer the sacrifices of the  became favorable. Now they too charged the , and the  met them, throwing away their bows.\nFirst they fought by the fence of shields, and when that was down, there was a fierce and long fight around the temple of  itself, until they came to blows at close quarters. For the barbarians laid hold of the spears and broke them short.\nNow the  were neither less valorous nor weaker, but they had no armor; moreover, since they were unskilled and no match for their adversaries in craft, they would rush out singly and in tens or in groups great or small, hurling themselves on the  and so perishing.\n\n\nWhere  was himself, riding a white horse in the battle and surrounded by a thousand picked men who were the flower of the , there they pressed their adversaries hardest. So long as  was alive the  stood their ground and defended themselves, overthrowing many .\nWhen, however,  was killed and his guards, who were the strongest part of the army, had also fallen, then the rest too yielded and gave ground before the men of . For what harmed them the most was the fact that they wore no armor over their clothes and fought, as it were, naked against men fully armed.\n\n\nOn that day the , as the oracle had foretold, gained from  their full measure of vengeance for the slaying of , and the most glorious of victories of all which we know was won by , the son of , who was the son of .\n\n(I have named the rest of ' ancestors in the lineage of , for they are the same for both.) As for , he was killed by , a  of note who long after the  business led three hundred men to battle at  against the whole army of , and was there killed, he and his three hundred.\n\n\nAt , however, the , routed by the , fled in disorder to their own camp and inside the wooden walls which they had made in the territory of .\nIt is indeed a marvel that although the battle was right by the grove of , there was no sign that any  had been killed in the precinct or entered into it; most of them fell near the temple in unconsecrated ground. I thinkif it is necessary to judge the ways of the godsthat the goddess herself denied them entry, since they had burnt her temple, the shrine at .\n\n\nThis, then, is what happened in this battle. But  son of  had from the very first disapproved of the king's leaving , and now all his counselling not to join battle had been of no avail. In his displeasure at what  was doing, he himself did as I will show.\nHe had with him a great army, as many as forty thousand men. He knew full well what the outcome of the battle would be, and no sooner had the  and  met than he led these with a fixed purpose, telling them to follow him all together wherever he should lead them, whatever they thought his intent might be.\nWith that command he pretended to lead them into battle. As he came farther on his way, he saw the  already fleeing and accordingly led his men, no longer in the same array, but took to his heels and fled with all speed not to the wooden fort nor to the walled city of , but to , so that he might make his way with all haste to the .\n\n\nSo  and his army turned that way. All the rest of the  who were on the king's side fought badly on purpose, but not so the ; they fought for a long time against the . For those  who were on the  side had great enthusiasm in the battle, and did not want to fight in a cowardly manner. As a result of this, three hundred of their first and best were killed there by the . At last, however, the  too yielded and they fled to , but not by the way which the  had fled and the multitude of the allies which had fought no fight to the end nor achieved any feat of arms.\n\n\nThis flight of theirs which took place before the actual closing of battle and was prompted because they saw the  flee, proves to me that it was on the  that the fortune of the barbarians hung. They accordingly all fled, save the cavalry,  and other; this helped the fleeing men in so far as it remained between them and their enemies and shielded its friends from the  in their flight.\n\n\nSo the , now having the upper hand, followed ' men, pursuing and slaying. During this steadily growing rout there came a message to the rest of the , who were by the temple of  and had stayed out of the fighting, that there had been a battle and that ' men were victorious. When they heard this, they set forth in no ordered array, those who were with the  keeping to the spurs of the mountain and the hill country, by the road that led upward straight to the temple of , and those who were with the  and  taking the most level route over the plain.\nHowever, when the  and  had come near the enemy, the  horsemen (whose captain was  son of ) caught sight of them approaching in haste and disorder, and rode at them; in this attack they trampled six hundred of them, and pursued and drove the rest to .\n\n\nSo these perished without anyone noticing. But when the  and the rest of the multitude had fled within the wooden wall, they managed to get up on the towers before the coming of the ; then they strengthened the wall as best they could. When the  arrived, an intense battle for the wall began.\nFor as long as the  were not there, the barbarians defended themselves and had a great advantage over the  who had no skill in the assault of walls. When the  came up, however, the fight for the wall became intense and lasted for a long time. In the end the , by valor and constant effort, scaled the wall and breached it. The  poured in through the opening they had made;\n\nthe first to enter were the , and it was they who plundered the tent of , taking from it besides everything else the feeding trough of his horses which was all of bronze and a thing well worth looking at. The  dedicated this feeding trough of  in the temple of . Everything else which they took they brought into the common pool, as did the rest of the .\nAs for the barbarians, they did not form a unified body again once the wall was down, nor did anyone think of defense because the terrified men in the tiny space and the many myriads herded together were in great distress.\nSuch a slaughter were the  able to make, that of two hundred and sixty thousand who remained after  had fled with his forty thousand, scarcely three thousand were left alive. Of the  from  ninety-one all together were killed in battle; of the , seventeen and of the , fifty-two.\n\n\nAmong the barbarians, the best fighters were the  infantry and the cavalry of the , and of men, it is said, the bravest was . Among the , the  and  conducted themselves nobly, but the  excelled all in valor.\nOf this my only clear proof is (for all these conquered the foes opposed to them) the fact that the  fought with the strongest part of the army, and overcame it. According to my judgment, the bravest man by far was , who had been reviled and dishonored for being the only man of the three hundred that came alive from ; next after him in valor were , , and .\nNevertheless, when there was a general discussion about who had borne himself most bravely, those  who were there judged that , who plainly wished to die because of the reproach hanging over him and so rushed out and left the battle column behind, had achieved great deeds, but that , who had no wish to die, proved himself a courageous fighter, and so in this way he was the better man.\nThis they may have said merely out of jealousy, but all the aforesaid who were killed in that fight received honor, save ; he, because he desired death because of the reproach previously mentioned, received none.\n\n\nThese won the most renown of all who fought at . For , who, when he came to the army, was the finest not only of the , but also of all the other , died away from the battle. , who was sitting in his place when  was offering sacrifice, was wounded in the side by an arrow.\nWhile his comrades were fighting, he was carried out of the battle and died a lingering death, saying to , a , that it was not a source of grief to him to die for ' sake; his sorrow was rather that he had struck no blow and achieved no deed worthy of his merit, despite all his eager desire to do so.\n\n\nOf the ,  son of  is said to have won renown, a man from the town of , whose people once did a deed that was of eternal value, as the  themselves say.\nFor in the past when the sons of  were trying to recover , after breaking into  with a great host, they turned the towns upside down because they did not know where  had been hidden, then (it is said) the  (and, as some say,  himself, because he was angered by the pride of  and feared for the whole land of ) revealed the whole matter to the sons of , and guided them to , which , one of the autochthonoi, handed over to to the .\nFor that deed the  have always had and still have freedom at  from all dues and chief places at feasts. In fact, even as recently as the war which was waged many years after this time between the  and , the  laid no hand on  when they harried the rest of .\n\n\nFrom that town was , who now was the best  fighter in the battle, and about him two tales are told. According to the first, he bore an iron anchor attached to the belt of his cuirass with a chain of bronze. He would cast this anchor whenever he approached his enemies in an attack so that the enemy, as they left their ranks, might not be able to move him from his place. When they were put to flight, it was his plan that he would pull up his anchor and so pursue them.\nSo runs this tale. The second which contradicts with the first and relates that he wore no iron anchor attached to his cuirass, but that his shield, which he constantly whirled round and never held still, had on it an anchor as a device.\n\n\nThere is yet another glorious deed which  did; when the  were besieging , he challenged and killed  the , a victor in the Five Contests. Long after this,  met his death when he was general of the  with , son of . He was killed at  by the  in a battle for the gold-mines.\n\n\nImmediately after the  had devastated the barbarians at , a woman, who was the concubine of  a , son of , deserting from the enemy, came to them. She, learning that the  were ruined and the  victorious, decked herself (as did also her attendants) with many gold ornaments and the fairest clothing that she had, and alighting thus from her carriage came to the  while they were still in the midst of slaughtering. When she saw , whose name and country she had often heard of, directing everything, she knew that it was he, and supplicated him clasping his knees:\n\nSave me, your suppliant, O king of , from captive slavery, for you have aided me till now, by making an end of those men who hold sacred nothing of the gods or of any divinities.  I am by birth, the daughter of , son of ; in  the  seized me by force and held me prisoner.\n\nTake heart, lady,  answered, for you are my suppliant, and furthermore if you are really the daughter of  of , he is my closest friend of all who dwell in those lands. For the present, he then entrusted her to those of the ephors who were present. Later he sent her to , where she herself desired to go.\n\n\nImmediately after the arrival of this woman, the men of  came when everything was already over. Upon learning that they had come too late for the battle, they were extremely upset and said that they ought to punish themselves for that.\nWhen they heard that those  with  were fleeing, they would have pursued them as far as . The , however, would not permit them to pursue the fleeing men.\nSo when they returned to their own land, the  banished the leaders of their army from the country. After the  came the men of , who also went away extremely upset, and after their departure, they too banished their leaders. Such were the doings of the  and .\n\n\nThere was at  in the army of the  one , son of , a leading man of . He hastened to  with really outrageous counsel and coming upon him, said to him:\n\nson of , you have done a deed of surpassing greatness and glory; the god has granted to you in saving  to have won greater renown than any  whom we know. But now you must finish what remains for the rest, so that your fame may be greater still and so that no barbarian will hereafter begin doing reckless deeds against the .\nWhen  was killed at ,  and  cut off his head and set it on a pole; make them a like return, and you will win praise from all  and the rest of  besides. For if you impale , you will be avenged for your father's brother .\n\n\nThis is what , thinking to please, said. , however, answered him as follows: , I thank you for your goodwill and forethought, but you have missed the mark of right judgment. First you exalt me and my fatherland and my deeds, yet next you cast me down to mere nothingness when you advise me to insult the dead, and say that I shall win more praise if I do so. That would be an act more proper for barbarians than for  and one that we consider worthy of censure even in barbarians.\nNo, as for myself, I would prefer to find no favor either with the people of  or anyone else who is pleased by such acts. It is enough for me if I please the  by righteous deeds and speech. As for , whom you would have me avenge, I think that he has received a full measure of vengeance; the uncounted souls of these that you see have done honor to him and the rest of those who died at . But to you this is my warning: do not come again to me with words like these nor give me such counsel. Be thankful now that you go unpunished.\n\n\nWith that  departed. Then  made a proclamation that no man should touch the spoils, and ordered the helots to gather all the stuff together. They, spreading all over the camp, found there tents adorned with gold and silver, and couches gilded and silver-plated, and golden bowls and cups and other drinking-vessels;\n\nand sacks they found on wagons, in which were seen cauldrons of gold and silver. They stripped from the dead who lay there their armlets and torques, and golden daggers; as for the embroidered clothing, it was disregarded.\nMuch of all this the helots showed, as much as they could not conceal, but much they stole and sold to the . As a result the  laid the foundation of their great fortunes by buying gold from the helots as though it were bronze.\n\n\nHaving brought all the loot together, they set apart a tithe for the god of . From this was made and dedicated that tripod which rests upon the bronze three-headed serpent, nearest to the altar; another they set apart for the god of , from which was made and dedicated a bronze figure of , ten cubits high; and another for the god of the Isthmus, from which was fashioned a bronze  seven cubits high. When they had set all this apart, they divided what remained, and each received, according to his worth, concubines of the  and gold and silver, and all the rest of the stuff and the beasts of burden.\nHow much was set apart and given to those who had fought best at , no man says. I think that they also received gifts, but tenfold of every kind, women, horses, talents, camels, and all other things also, was set apart and given to .\n\n\nThis other story is also told. When  fled from , he left to  his own establishment. , seeing ' establishment with its display of gold and silver and gaily colored tapestry, ordered the bakers and the cooks to prepare a dinner such as they were accustomed to do for .\nThey did his bidding, but , when he saw golden and silver couches richly covered, and tables of gold and silver, and all the magnificent service of the banquet, was amazed at the splendor before him, and for a joke commanded his own servants to prepare a dinner in  fashion. When that meal, so different from the other, was ready,  burst out laughing and sent for the generals of the .\nWhen these had assembled,  pointed to the manner in which each dinner was served and said: Men of , I have brought you here because I desired to show you the foolishness of the leader of the  who, with such provisions for life as you see, came here to take away from us our possessions which are so pitiful. In this way, it is said,  spoke to the generals of the .\n\n\nLong after these events many of the  also found chests full of gold and silver and other things.\nMoreover, when their bodies (which the  gathered into one place) were laid bare of flesh, a skull was found of which the bone was all of one piece without suture. A jawbone also came to light in which the teeth of the upper jaw were one whole, a single bone, front teeth and grinders, and one could see the body of a man of five cubits stature.\n\n\nAs for the body of , it was removed on the day after the battle; by whom, I cannot with certainty say. I have, however, heard of very many countries that buried , and I know of many that were richly rewarded for that act by ' son .\n\n Which of them it was that stole and buried the body of  I cannot learn for certain. Some report that it was buried by , an . Such was the manner of ' burial.\n\n\nBut the , when they had divided the spoils at , buried each contingent of their dead in a separate place. The  made three tombs; there they buried their irens, among whom were , , , and .\nIn one of the tombs, then, were the irens, in the second the rest of the , and in the third the helots. This, then is how the  buried their dead. The , however, buried all theirs together in a place apart, and the  did similarly with their own dead. So too did the  and  with those who had been killed by the horsemen.\nAll the tombs of these peoples were filled with dead; but as for the rest of the states whose tombs are to be seen at , their tombs are but empty barrows that they built for the sake of men that should come after, because they were ashamed to have been absent from the battle. There is one there called the tomb of the , which, as I learn by inquiry, was built as late as ten years after, at the ' desire, by their patron and protector  son of , a .\n\n\nAs soon as the  had buried their dead at , they resolved in council that they would march against  and demand surrender of those who had taken the  sideparticularly of  and , who were chief among their foremost men. If these men were not delivered to them, they would not withdraw from the area in front of the city till they had taken it.\nThey came with this purpose on the eleventh day after the battle and laid siege to the , demanding the surrender of the men. When the  refused this surrender, they laid waste to their lands and assaulted the walls.\n\n\nSeeing that the  would not cease from their harrying and nineteen days had passed,  spoke as follows to the : Men of , since the  have resolved that they will not raise the siege till  is taken or we are delivered to them, do not let the land of  increase the measure of its ills for our sake.\nNo, rather if it is money they desire and their demand for our surrender is but a pretext, let us give them money out of our common treasury (for it was by the common will and not ours alone that we took the  side). If, however, they are besieging the town for no other reason than to have us, then we will give ourselves up to be tried by them. This seemed to be said well and at the right time, and the  immediately sent a herald to , offering to surrender the men.\n\n\nOn these terms they made an agreement, but  escaped from the town. His sons were seized, but  held them free of guilt, saying that the sons were not accessory to the treason. As for the rest of the men whom the  surrendered, they supposed that they would be put on trial, and were confident that they would defeat the impeachment by bribery. , however, had that very suspicion of them, and when they were put into his hands he sent away the whole allied army and carried the men to , where he put them to death. This is what happened at  and .\n\n\n the son of  was by now far on his way in his flight from . The , when he came among them, entertained him hospitably and inquired of him concerning the rest of the army, knowing nothing of what had happened at .\n\n understood that if he told them the whole truth about the fighting, he would endanger his own life and the lives of all those with him, for he thought that every man would set upon him if they heard the story. Therefore, although he had revealed nothing to the , he spoke as follows to the :\n\nI myself, men of , am pressing on with all speed and diligence to march into , being despatched from the army for a certain purpose with the men whom you see.  and his army are expected marching close on my heels. It is for you to entertain him, and show that you do him good service, for if you so do, you will not afterwards regret it.\nSo saying, he used all diligence to lead his army away straight towards  through  and  without any delay, following the shortest inland road. So he came to , but he left behind many of his army who had been cut down by the  or overcome by hunger and weariness. From  he crossed over in boats. In such a way  returned to .\n\n\nNow on the same day when the  were so stricken at , it so happened that they suffered a similar fate at  in . When the  who had come in their ships with  the  were encamped at , certain messengers came to them there from ,  of ,  son of , and  son of . The  had sent these, keeping their despatch secret from the  and the tyrant  son of , whom the  had made tyrant of .\nWhen they came before the generals,  spoke long and vehemently: If the  but see you, he said, they will revolt from the , and the barbarians will not remain; but if they do remain, you will have such a prey as never again.  He begged them in the name of the gods of their common worship to deliver  from slavery and drive the barbarian away.\nThat, he said, would be an easy matter for them, for the  ships are unseaworthy and no match for yours; and if you have any suspicion that we may be tempting you deceitfully, we are ready to be taken in your ships as hostages.\n\n\nAs the  stranger was pleading so earnestly,  asked him (whether it was that he desired to know for the sake of a presage, or through some happy chance of a god),  stranger, what is your name? , he replied.\nThen  cut short whatever else  had begun to say, and cried: I accept the omen of your name,  stranger; now see to it that before you sail from here you and those who are with you pledge that the  will be our zealous allies.\n\n\nHe said this and added deed to word. For straightway the  bound themselves by pledge and oath to alliance with the .\nThis done, the rest sailed away, but  bade  to sail with the  because of the good omen of his name. The  waited through that day, and on the next they sought and received favorable augury; their diviner was  son of , a man of that  which is in the  gulf. This man's father  had once fared as I will now relate.\n\n\nThere is at  a certain flock sacred to the Sun, which in the daytime is pastured beside the river , which flows from the mountain called  through the lands of  and empties into the sea by the harbor of . By night, those townsmen who are most notable for wealth or lineage are chosen to watch it, each man serving for a year, for the people of  set great store by this flock, being so taught by a certain oracle. It is kept in a cave far distant from the town.\nNow at the time of which I speak,  was the chosen watchman. But one night he fell asleep, and wolves, coming past his guard into the cave, killed about sixty of the flock. When  was aware of it, he held his peace and told no man, intending to restore what was lost by buying others.\nThis matter was not, however, hidden from the people of , and when it came to their knowledge they brought him to judgment and condemned him to lose his eyesight for sleeping at his watch. So they blinded , but from the day of their so doing their flocks bore no offspring, nor did their land yield fruit as before.\nFurthermore, a declaration was given to them at  and , when they inquired of the prophets what might be the cause of their present ill: the gods told them by their prophets that they had done unjustly in blinding , the guardian of the sacred flock, for we ourselves (they said) sent those wolves, and we will not cease from avenging him until you make him such restitution for what you did as he himself chooses and approves; when that is fully done, we ourselves will give  such a gift as will make many men consider him happy.\n\n\nThis was the oracle given to the people of . They kept it secret and charged certain of their townsmen to carry the business through; they acted as I will now show. Coming and sitting down by  at the place where he sat, they spoke of other matters, till at last they fell to commiserating his misfortune. Guiding the conversation in this way, they asked him what compensation he would choose, if the people of  should promise to requite him for what they had done.\nHe, knowing nothing of the oracle, said he would choose for a gift the lands of certain named townsmen whom he thought to have the two fairest estates in , and a house besides which he knew to be the fairest in the town; let him (he said) have possession of these, and he would lay aside his anger, and be satisfied with that by way of restitution.\nSo he said this, and those who were sitting beside him said in reply: , the people of  hereby make you that restitution for the loss of your sight, obeying the oracle given to them. At that he was very angry, for he learned through this the whole story and saw that they had cheated him. They did, however, buy from the possessors and give him what he had chosen, and from that day he had a natural gift of divination, through which he won fame.\n\n\n, the son of this , had been brought by the , and was the army's prophet. But I have heard it said before now, that  was not the son of , but made a wrongful use of that name and worked for wages up and down .\n\n\nHaving won favorable omens, the  put out to sea from  for . When they were now near  in the  territory, they anchored there near the temple of  which is in those parts, and prepared for a sea-fight. The , learning of their approach, also put out to sea and made for the mainland with all their ships save the , whom they sent sailing away. It was determined by them in council that they would not do battle by sea,\n\nfor they thought themselves overmatched; the reason of their making for the mainland was that they might be under the shelter of their army at , which had been left by ' command behind the rest of his host to hold . There were sixty thousand men in it, and , the noblest and tallest man in , was their general.\nIt was the design of the  admirals to flee to the shelter of that army, and there to beach their ships and build a fence round them which should be a protection for the ship and a refuge for themselves.\n\n\nWith this design they put to sea. So when they came past the temple of the Goddesses at  to the  and , where there is a temple of  (which was built by  son of  when he went with  son of  to the founding of ), they beached their ships and fenced them round with stones and the trunks of orchard trees which they cut down; they drove in stakes around the fence and prepared for siege or victory, making ready, after consideration, for either event.\n\n\nWhen the  learned that the barbarians had gone off to the mainland, they were not all pleased that their enemy had escaped them, and did not know whether to return back or set sail for the . At last they resolved that they would do neither, but sail to the mainland.\nEquipping themselves for this with gangways and everything else necessary for a sea-fight, they held their course for . When they approached the camp, no one put out to meet them. Seeing the ships beached within the wall and a great host of men drawn up in array along the strand,  first sailed along in his ship, keeping as near to the shore as he could, and made this proclamation to the  by the voice of a herald:\n\nMen of , you who hear us, understand what I say, for by no means will the  understand anything I charge you with when we join battle; first of all it is right for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry : and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it.\nThe purpose of this act was the same as ' purpose at ; either the message would be unknown to the barbarians and would prevail with the , or if it were thereafter reported to the barbarians, it would cause them to mistrust their  allies.\n\n\nAfter this counsel of , the  brought their ships to land and disembarked on the beach, where they formed a battle column. But the , seeing the  prepare for battle and exhort the , first of all took away the ' armor, suspecting that they would aid the ;\n\nfor indeed when the barbarian's ships brought certain  captives, who had been left in  and taken by ' army, the  had set them all free and sent them away to  with provisions for the journey; for this reason in particular they were held suspect, as having set free five hundred souls of ' enemies.\nFurthermore, they appointed the  to guard the passes leading to the heights of , alleging that they were best acquainted with the country. Their true reason, however, for so doing was that the  should be separate from the rest of their army. In such a manner the  safeguarded themselves from those  who (they supposed) might turn against them if opportunity were given for themselves: they set their shields close to make a barricade.\n\n\nThe , having made all their preparations advanced their line against the barbarians. As they went, a rumor spread through the army, and a herald's wand was seen lying by the water-line. The rumor that ran was to the effect that the  were victors over ' army at a battle in .\nNow there are many clear indications of the divine ordering of things, seeing that a message, which greatly heartened the army and made it ready to face danger, arrived amongst the  the very day on which the ' disaster at  and that other which was to befall them at  took place.\n\n\nMoreover, there was the additional coincidence, that there were precincts of  on both battlefields; for at  the fight was near the temple of , as I have already said, and so it was to be at  also.\nIt happened that the rumor of a victory won by the  with  was true, for the defeat at  happened while it was yet early in the day, and the defeat of  in the afternoon. That the two fell on the same day of the same month was proven to the  when they examined the matter not long afterwards.\nNow before this rumor came they had been faint-hearted, fearing less for themselves than for the  with , that  should stumble over . But when the report sped among them, they grew stronger and swifter in their onset. So  and barbarians alike were eager for battle, seeing that the islands and the  were the prizes of victory.\n\n\nAs for the  and those whose place was nearest them, that is, for about half of the line, their way lay over the beach and level ground; for the  and those that were next to them, their way lay through a ravine and among hills. While the  were making a circuit, those others on the other wing were already fighting.\nAs long as the ' shields stood upright, they defended themselves and held their own in the battle, but when the  and their neighbors in the line passed the word and went more zealously to work, that they and not the  might win the victory, immediately the face of the fight changed.\nBreaking down the shields they charged all together into the midst of the , who received the onset and stood their ground for a long time, but at last fled within their wall. The  and  and  and , who were next to each other in the line, followed close after and rushed in together. But when the walled place had been razed, the barbarians made no further defense, but took to flight, all save the ,\n\nwho gathered into bands of a few men and fought with whatever  came rushing within the walls. Of the  leaders two escaped by flight and two were killed;  and , who were admirals of the fleet, escaped;  and , the general of the land army, were killed fighting.\n\n\nWhile the  still fought, the  and their comrades came up and finished what was left of the business. The  too lost many men there, notably the men of  and their general .\nAs for the  who served in the Median army and had been disarmed, they, seeing from the first that victory hung in the balance, did what they could in their desire to aid the . When the other  saw the  set the example, they also abandoned the  and attacked the foreigners.\n\n\nThe  had for their own safety appointed the  to watch the passes, so that if anything should happen to the  army such as did happen to it, they might have guides to bring them safely to the heights of . This was the task to which the  were appointed for the reason mentioned above and so that they might not be present with the army and so turn against it. They acted wholly contrary to the charge laid upon them; they misguided the fleeing  by ways that led them among their enemies, and at last they themselves became their worst enemies and killed them. In this way  revolted for the second time from the .\n\n\nIn that battle those of the  who fought best were the , and the  who fought best was one who practised the pancratium,  son of . This  on a later day met his death in a battle at  in  during a war between the  and , and lay dead on . Those who fought best after the  were the men of  and  and .\n\n\nWhen the  had made an end of most of the barbarians, either in battle or in flight, they brought out their booty onto the beach, and found certain stores of wealth. Then after burning the ships and the whole of the wall, they sailed away.\nWhen they had arrived at , they debated in council over the removal of all  from , and in what  lands under their dominion it would be best to plant the , leaving the country itself to the barbarians; for it seemed impossible to stand on guard between the  and their enemies forever. If, however, they should not so stand, they had no hope that the  would permit the  to go unpunished.\nIn this matter the  who were in charge were for removing the people from the lands of those  nations which had sided with the  and giving their land to the  to dwell in. The  disliked the whole plan of removing the  from , or allowing the  to determine the lot of  colonies, and as they resisted vehemently, the  yielded.\nIt accordingly came about that they admitted to their alliance the , , , and all other islanders who had served with their forces, and bound them by pledge and oaths to remain faithful and not desert their allies. When the oaths had been sworn, the  set sail to break the bridges, supposing that these still held fast. So they laid their course for the .\n\n\nThe few barbarians who escaped were driven to the heights of , and made their way from there to . While they were making their way along the road,  son of , who happened to have been present at the  disaster, reviled the admiral  very bitterly, telling him (with much beside) that such generalship as his proved him worse than a woman, and that no punishment was too severe for the harm he had done the king's estate. Now it is the greatest of all taunts in  to be called worse than a woman.\nThese many insults angered  so much that he drew his sword upon  to kill him, but  son of  of , who stood behind  himself saw him run at , and caught him round the middle and lifted and hurled him to the ground. In the meantime ' guards had also come between them.\nBy doing so  won the gratitude of  himself and , for saving the king's brother. For this deed he was made ruler of all  by the king's gift. Then they went on their way without anything further happening and came to .\n\n\nNow it happened that the king had been at  ever since he came there in flight from  after his overthrow in the sea-fight. Being then at  he became enamored of ' wife, who was also there. But as all his messages could not bring her to yield to him, and he would not force her to his will, out of regard for his brother  (which indeed counted with the woman also, for she knew well that no force would be used against her),  found no other way to accomplish his purpose than that he should make a marriage between his own son  and the daughter of this woman and , for he thought that by doing so he would be most likely to win her.\nSo he betrothed them with all due ceremony and rode away to . But when he had come and had taken ' bride into his house, he thought no more of ' wife, but changed his mind and wooed and won this girl , ' wife and ' daughter.\n\n\nAs time went on, however, the truth came to light, and in such manner as I will show. ' wife, , wove and gave to him a great gaily-colored mantle, marvellous to see.  was pleased with it, and went to  wearing it.\nBeing pleased with her too, he asked her what she wanted in return for her favors, for he would deny nothing at her asking. Thereuponfor she and all her house were doomed to evilshe said to , Will you give me whatever I ask of you? He promised this, supposing that she would ask anything but that; when he had sworn, she asked boldly for his mantle.\n\n tried to refuse her, for no reason except that he feared that  might have clear proof of his doing what she already guessed. He accordingly offered her cities instead and gold in abundance and an army for none but herself to command. Armies are the most suitable of gifts in . But as he could not move her, he gave her the mantle; and she, rejoicing greatly in the gift, went flaunting her finery.\n\n\n heard that she had the mantle, but when she learned the truth, it was not the girl with whom she was angry. She supposed rather that the girl's mother was guilty and that this was her doing, and so it was ' wife whom she plotted to destroy.\nShe waited therefore till  her husband should be giving his royal feast. This banquet is served once a year, on the king's birthday; the  name for it is tukta, which is in the  language perfect. On that day (and none other) the king anoints his head and makes gifts to the . Waiting for that day,  then asked of  that ' wife should be given to her.\n\n considered it a terrible and wicked act to give up his brother's wife, and that too when she was innocent of the deed; for he knew the purpose of the request.\n\n\nNevertheless, since  was insistent and the law compelled him (for at this royal banquet in  every request must of necessity be granted), he unwillingly consented, and delivered the woman to . Then, bidding her do what she wanted, he sent for his brother and spoke as follows:\n\n, you are ' son and my brother, and a good man; hear me then. You must no longer live with her who is now your wife. I give you my daughter in her place. Take her for your own, but do away with the wife that you have, for it is not my will that you should have her.\nAt that  was amazed; Sire, he said, what is this evil command that you lay upon me, telling me to deal with my wife in this way? I have by her young sons and daughters, of whom you have taken a wife for your own son, and I am very content with her herself. Yet you are asking me to get rid of my wife and wed your daughter?\nTruly, O king, I consider it a great honor to be accounted worthy of your daughter, but I will do neither the one nor the other. No, rather, do not force me to consent to such a desire. You will find another husband for your daughter as good as I, but permit me to keep my own wife.\nThis was ' response, but  was very angry and said: You have come to this pass, . I will give you no daughter of mine as a wife, nor will you any longer live with her whom you now have. In this way you will learn to accept that which is offered you. Hearing that,  said No, sire, you have not destroyed me yet! and so departed.\n\n\nIn the meantime, while  talked with his brother,  sent for ' guards and treated ' wife very cruelly; she cut off the woman's breasts and threw them to dogs, and her nose and ears and lips also, and cut out her tongue. Then she sent her home after she had undergone this dreadful ordeal.\n\n\nKnowing nothing of this as yet, but fearing evil,  ran home. Seeing what had been done to his wife, he immediately took counsel with his children and set out for  with his own sons (and others too), intending to raise the province of  in revolt and do the king the greatest of harm.\nThis he would have done, to my thinking, had he escaped to the country of the  and . They were fond of him, and he was viceroy over the . But it was of no use, for  learned what he intended and sent against him an army which killed him on his way, and his sons and his army. Such is the story of ' love and ' death.\n\n\nThe  who had set out from  for the  first anchored off  having been stopped by contrary winds, and came from there to , where they found the bridges broken which they thought would still be in place; these were in fact the chief cause of their coming to the .\nThe  then who were with  decided to sail away to , but the , with  their general, that they would remain there and attack the . So the rest sailed away, but the  crossed over to the  and laid siege to .\n\n\nNow when the  heard that the  were at the , they had come in from the neighboring towns and assembled at this same , seeing that it was the strongest walled place in that region. Among them there was a  named  from , and he had carried the equipment of the bridges there.  was held by the  of the country, but with him were  and a great multitude of their allies.\n\n\nThis province was ruled by ' viceroy , a cunning man and a wicked one; witness the deceit that he practised on the king in his march to , how he stole away from  the treasure of  son of .\nThis was the way of it; there is at  in the  the tomb of , and a precinct around it, which contained much treasure: vessels of gold and silver, bronze, clothing, and other dedications; all of which  carried off by the king's gift.\n\nSire, he said deceitfully to , there is here the house of a certain , who met a just death for invading your territory with an army; give me this man's house, so that all may be taught not to invade your territory. One would think that this plea would easily persuade  to give him a man's house, since the latter had no suspicion of ' meaning. His reason for saying that  had invaded the king's territory was that the  believe all  to belong to themselves and whoever is their king. So when the treasure was given to him, he carried it away from  to , and planted and farmed the precinct. He would also come from  and have intercourse with women in the shrine. Now, when the  laid siege to him, he had made no preparation for it; he did not think that the  would come, and he had no way of escaping from their attack.\n\n\nSince the siege continued into the late autumn, the  grew weary of their absence from home and their lack of success at taking the fortress. They accordingly entreated their generals to lead them away again, but the generals refused to do that till they should take the place or be recalled by the  state. At that the men endured their plight patiently.\n\n\nBut those who were within the walls were by now reduced to the last extremity, so much so that they boiled the thongs of their beds for food. At last, however, even these failed them, and  and  and all the  made their way down from the back part of the fortress, where the fewest of their enemies were, and fled at nightfall.\n\n When morning came, the people of the  signified from their towers to the  what had happened, and opened their gates. The greater part of the  then went in pursuit, while the rest stayed to hold the town.\n\n\nAs  was making his escape into , the  of that country caught and sacrificed him in their customary manner to  the god of their land; as for his companions, they did away with them by other means.\n\n and his company had begun their flight later, and were overtaken a little way beyond the , where after they had defended themselves a long time, some of them were killed and the rest taken alive. The  bound them and carried them to , and together with them  and his son also in bonds.\n\n\nIt is related by the people of the  that a marvellous thing happened one of those who guarded . He was frying dried fish, and these as they lay over the fire began to leap and writhe as though they had just been caught.\nThe rest gathered around, amazed at the sight, but when  saw this strange thing, he called the one who was frying the fish and said to him: , do not be afraid of this portent, for it is not to you that it has been sent; it is to me that  of  is trying to signify that although he is dead and dry, he has power given him by the god to take vengeance on me, the one who wronged him.\nNow therefore I offer a ransom, the sum of one hundred talents to the god for the treasure that I took from his temple. I will also pay to the  two hundred talents for myself and my son, if they spare us.\nBut  the general was unmoved by this promise, for the people of  desired that  should be put to death in revenge for , and the general himself was so inclined. So they carried  away to the headland where  had bridged the strait (or, by another story, to the hill above the town of ), and there nailed him to boards and hanged him. As for his son, they stoned him to death before his father's eyes.\n\n\nThis done, they sailed away to , carrying with them the cables of the bridges to be dedicated in their temples, and all sorts of things in addition. This, then, is all that was done in this year.\n\n\nThis  who was crucified was the grandson of that  who instructed the  in a design which they took from him and laid before ; this was its purport:\n\nSeeing that  grants lordship to the  people, and to you, , among them, let us, after reducing , depart from the little and rugged land which we possess and occupy one that is better. There are many such lands on our borders, and many further distant. If we take one of these, we will all have more reasons for renown. It is only reasonable that a ruling people should act in this way, for when will we have a better opportunity than now, when we are lords of so many men and of all ?\n\n heard them, and found nothing to marvel at in their design; Go ahead and do this, he said; but if you do so, be prepared no longer to be rulers but rather subjects. Soft lands breed soft men; wondrous fruits of the earth and valiant warriors grow not from the same soil.\nThe  now realized that  reasoned better than they, and they departed, choosing rather to be rulers on a barren mountain side than dwelling in tilled valleys to be slaves to others."}}]}}}}
