In the\nfirst place then he would not have been a Hercules, when\nhe was dreaming away all his life in such luxury and ease;\nand even if he had been one, what would have been the\nuse of him? and what the use of his arms, and of the\nstrength of the other parts of his body, and his endurance\nand noble spirit, if such circumstances and occasions had\nnot roused and exercised him? Well then must a man\nprovide for himself such means of exercise, and seek to introduce a lion from some place into his country, and a boar,\nand a hydra? This would be folly and madness: but as\nthey did exist, and were found, they were useful for showing what Hercules was and for exercising him. Come\nthen do you also having observed these things look to the\nfaculties which you have, and when you have looked at\nthem, say: Bring now, 0 Zeus, any difficulty that thou\npleasest, for I have means given to me by thee and powers\n\nfor honouring myself through the things which happen.\nYou do not so: but you sit still, trembling for fear that\nsome things will happen, and weeping, and lamenting, and\ngroaning for what does happen: and then you blame the\ngods. For what is the consequence of such meanness of\nspirit but impiety? And yet God has not only given us\nthese faculties; by which we shall be able to bear everything thing happens without being depressed or broken by\nit; but, like a good king and a true father, He has given us\nthese faculties free from hindrance, subject to no compulsion, unimpeded, and has put them entirely in our own\npower, without even having reserved to Himself any power\nof hindering or impeding. You, who have received these\npowers free and as your own, use them not: you do not\neven see what you have received, and from whom; some of\nyou being blinded to the giver, and not even acknowledging your benefactor, and others, through meanness of\nspirit, betaking yourselves to fault-finding and making\ncharges against God.

Certainly. But where there is ignorance, there also there is\nwant of learning and training in things which are necessary. He assented to this.

But in the present matter I have so muck\nas this to aid you towards what you wish. Does affection\nto those of your family appear to you to be according to\nnature and to be good? Certainly. Well, is such affection\nnatural and good, and is a thing consistent with reason not\ngood? By no means. Is then that which is consistent with\nreason in contradiction with affection? I think not. You\nare right, for if it is otherwise, it is necessary that one of\nthe contradictions being according to nature, the other must\nbe contrary to nature. Is it not so? It is, he said. Whatever\nthen we shall discover to be at the same time affectionate\nand also consistent with reason, this we confidently declare\nto be right and good. Agreed. Well then to leave your\nsick child and to go away is not reasonable, and I suppose\nthat you will not say that it is; but it remains for us to\ninquire if it is consistent with affection. Yes, let us consider. Did you then, since you had an affectionate disposition to your child, do right when you ran off and left her;\nand has the mother no affection for the child? Certainly,\nshe has. Ought then the mother also to have left her, or\nought she not? She ought not. And the nurse, does she\n\nlove her? She does. Ought then she also to have left her?\nBy no means. And the paedagogue, does he not love her?\nHe does love her. Ought then he also to have deserted\nher? and so should the child have been left alone and\nwithout help on account of the great affection of you the\nparents and of those about her, or should she have died in\nthe hands of those who neither loved her nor cared for her?\nCertainly not. Now this is unfair and unreasonable, not\nto allow those who have equal affection with yourself to do\nwhat you think to be proper for yourself to do because you\nhave affection. It is absurd. Come then, if you were\nsick, would you wish your relations to be so affectionate,\nand all the rest, children and wife, as to leave you alone\nand deserted? By no means. And would you wish to be\nso loved by your own that through their excessive affection\nyou would always be left alone in sickness? or for this\nreason would you rather pray, if it were possible, to be\nloved by your enemies and deserted by them?

In\nthings which are independent of the will. In what cases\non the contrary do we behave with confidence, as if there\nwere no danger? In things dependent on the will. To\nbe deceived then, or to act rashly, or shamelessly or with\nbase desire to seek something, does not concern us at all,\nif we only hit the mark in things which are independent\nof our will.

Therefore as we may expect it to happen\nwith those who err in the greatest matters, we convert\nnatural confidence (that is, according to nature) into\naudacity, desperation, rashness, shamelessness; and we\nconvert natural caution and modesty into cowardice and\nmeanness, which are full of fear and confusion.

By\nbeing of a noble disposition, and happy. For it is not\nreasonable to be mean-spirited nor to lament yourself, nor\nto depend on another, nor ever to blame God or man. I\nentreat you, become an affectionate person in this way, by\nobserving these rules. But if through this affection, as\nyou name it, you are going to be a slave and wretched,\nthere is no profit in being affectionate. And what prevents\nyou from loving another as a person subject to mortality,\nas one who may go away from you. Did not Socrates love\nhis own children? He did; but it was as a free man, as\none who remembered that he must first be a friend to the\ngods. For this reason he violated nothing which was becoming to a good man, neither in making his defence nor\n\nby fixing a penalty on himself, nor even in the former part\nof his life when he was a senator or when he was a soldier.\nBut we are fully supplied with every pretext for being\nof ignoble temper, some for the sake of a child, some for a\nmother, and others for brethren's sake. But it is not fit\nfor us to be unhappy on account of any person, but to be\nhappy on account of all, but chiefly on account of God who\nhas made us for this end. Well, did Diogenes love\nnobody, who was so kind and so much a lover of all that\nfor mankind in general he willingly undertook so much\nlabour and bodily sufferings? He did love mankind, but\nhow? As became a minister of God, at the same time\ncaring for men, and being also subject to God. For this\nreason all the earth was his country, and no particular\nplace; and when he was taken prisoner he did not regret\n nor his associates and friends there, but even he\nbecame familiar with the pirates and tried to improve\nthem; and being sold afterwards he lived in  as\nbefore at ; and he would have behaved the same,\nif he had gone to the country of the Perrhaebi. Thus is\nfreedom acquired. For this reason he used to say, Ever\nsince Antisthenes made me free, I have not been a slave.\nHow did Antisthenes make him free? Hear what he says:\nAntisthenes taught me what is my own, and what is not\nmy own; possessions are not my own, nor kinsmen,\ndomestics, friends, nor reputation, nor places familiar, nor\nmode of life; all these belong to others. What then is\nyour own? The use of appearances. This he showed to\nme, that I possess it free from hindrance, and from com-\n\npulsion, no person can put an obstacle in my way, no\nperson can force me to use appearances otherwise than I\nwish. Who then has any power over me? Philip or\nAlexander, or Perdiccas or the great king? How have they\nthis power? For if a man is going to be overpowered by\na man, he must long before be overpowered by things. If\nthen pleasure is not able to subdue a man, nor pain, nor\nfame, nor wealth, but he is able, when he chooses, to spit\nout all his poor body in a man's face and depart from life,\nwhose slave can he still be? But if he dwelt with pleasure\nin Athens, and was overpowered by this manner of life,\nhis affairs would have been at every man's command; the\nstronger would have had the power of grieving him. How\ndo you think that Diogenes would have flattered the\npirates that they might sell him to some Athenian, that\nsome time he might see that beautiful Piraeus, and the\nLong Walls and the Acropolis? In what condition would\nyou see them? As a captive, a slave and mean: and what\nwould be the use of it for you?Not so: but I should see\nthem as a free manShow me, how you would be free.\nObserve, some person has caught you, who leads you\naway from your accustomed place of abode and says, You\nare my slave, for it is in my power to hinder you from\nliving as you please, it is in my power to treat you gently,\nand to humble you: when I choose, on the contrary you\nare cheerful and go elated to Athens. What do you say to\nhim who treats you as a slave? What means have you of\nfinding one who will rescue you from slavery? Or cannot\nyou even look him in the face, but without saying more do\nyou intreat to be set free? Man, you ought to go gladly to\nprison, hastening, going before those who lead you there.\nThen, I ask you, are you unwilling to live in Rome and\ndesire to live in Hellas (Greece)? And when you must\ndie, will you then also fill us with your lamentations,\nbecause you will not see Athens nor walk about in the\nLyceion? Have you gone abroad for this? was it for this\nreason you have sought to find some person from whom\nyou might receive benefit? What benefit? That you may\n\nsolve syllogisms more readily, or handle hypothotical\narguments? and for this reason did you leave brother,\ncountry, friends, your family, that you might return when\nyou had learned these things? So you did not go abroad\nto obtain constancy of mind, nor freedom from perturbation,\nnor in order that being secure from harm you may never\ncomplain of any person, accuse no person, and no man may\nwrong you, and thus you may maintain your relative\nposition without impediment? This is a fine traffic that\nyou have gone abroad for in syllogisms and sophistical\narguments and hypothetical: if you like, take your\nplace in the agora (market or public place) and proclaim\nthem for sale like dealers in physic. Will you not deny\neven all that you have learned that you may not bring a\nbad name on your theorems as useless? What harm has\nphilosophy done you? Wherein has Chrysippus injured\nyou that you should prove by your acts that his labours\nare useless? Were the evils that you had there (at home)\nnot enough, those which were the cause of your pain and\nlamentation, even if you had not gone abroad? Have you\nadded more to the list? And if you again have other\nacquaintances and friends, you will have more causes for\nlamentation; and the same also if you take an affection\nfor another country. Why then do you live to surround\nyourself with other sorrows upon sorrows through which\nyou are unhappy? Then, I ask you, do you call this\naffection? What affection, man! If it is a good thing, it\nis the cause of no evil: if it is bad, I have nothing to do\nwith it.

'But if there\nbe no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen' (v. 13); and\n(v. 19), 'if in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men\nmost miserable.' But he affirms again (v. 20) that 'Christ is risen and\nbecome the first fruits of them that slept.' In v. 32, he asks what\nadvantages he has from his struggles in Ephesus, 'if the dead rise\nnot: let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.' He seems not to\nadmit the value of life, if there is no resurrection of the dead; and he\nseems to say that we shall seek or ought to seek only the pleasures of\nsense, because life is short, if we do not believe in a resurrection of\nthe dead. It may be added that there is not any direct assertion in\nthis chapter that Christ ascended to heaven in a bodily form, or that\nhe ascended to heaven in any way.

And an example of this as well as of all other\nthings is proposed to us in the life of Socrates, who not\nonly himself on all occasions avoided fights (quarrels), but\nwould not allow even others to quarrel. See in Xenophon's\nSymposium how many quarrels he settled, how further\nhe endured Thrasymachus and Polus and Callicles; how\nhe tolerated his wife, and how he tolerated his son who\nattempted to confute him and to cavil with him. For he\nremembered well that no man has in his power another\nman's ruling principle. He wished therefore for nothing\nelse than that which was his own. And what is this?\nNot that this or that man may act according to nature;\nfor that is a thing which belongs to another; but that\nwhile others are doing their own acts, as they choose, he\nmay never the less be in a condition conformable to\nnature and live in it, only doing what is his own to the\nend that others also may be in a state conformable to\nnature. For this is the object always set before him by\nthe wise and good man. Is it to be commander (a\npraetor) of an army? No: but if it is permitted him,\nhis object is in this matter to maintain his own ruling\nprinciple. Is it to marry? No; but if marriage is allowed\nto him, in this matter his object is to maintain himself in\na condition conformable to nature. But if he would have\nhis son not to do wrong or his wife, he would have what\nbelongs to another not to belong to another: and to be\ninstructed is this, to learn what things are a man's own\nand what belongs to another.\nHow then is there left any place for fighting (quarrel-\nling) to a man who has this opinion (which he ought to\nhave)? Is he surprised at any thing which happens,\n\nand does it appear new to him? Does he not expect\nthat which comes from the bad to be worse and more\ngrievous than what actually befals him? And does he not\nreckon as pure gain whatever they (the bad) may do\nwhich falls short of extreme wickedness? Such a person\nhas reviled you. Great thanks to him for not having\nstruck you. But he has struck me also. Great thanks\nthat he did not wound you. But he wounded me also.\nGreat thanks that he did not kill you. For when did he\nlearn or in what school that man is a tame animal, that\nmen love one another, that an act of injustice is a great\nharm to him who does it. Since then he has not learned\nthis and is not convinced of it, why shall he not follow\nthat which seems to be for his own interest? Your\nneighbour has thrown stones. Have you then done any\nthing wrong? But the things in the house have been\nbroken. Are you then a utensil? No; but a free power\nof will. What then is given to you (to do) in answer to\nthis? If you are like a wolf, you must bite in return, and\nthrow more stones. But if you consider what is proper\nfor a man, examine your storehouse, see with what faculties you came into the world. Have you the disposition\nof a wild beast, have you the disposition of revenge for an\ninjury? When is a horse wretched? When he is deprived\nof his natural faculties, not when he cannot crow like a\ncock, but when he cannot run. When is a dog wretched?\nNot when he cannot fly, but when he cannot track his\ngame. Is then a man also unhappy in this way, not\nbecause he cannot strangle lions or embrace statues, for\nhe did not come into the world in the possession of certain\npowers from nature for this purpose, but because he has\nlost his probity and his fidelity? People ought to meet\nand lament such a man for the misfortunes into which he\n\nhas fallen; not indeed to lament because a man has been\nborn or has died, but because it has happened to him in\nhis life time to have lost the things which are his own,\nnot that which he received from his father, not his land\nand house, and his inn, and his slaves; for not one of\nthese things is a man's own, but all belong to others, are\nservile, and subject to account (), at different\ntimes given to different persons by those who have them\nin their power: but I mean the things which belong to\nhim as a man, the marks (stamps) in his mind with which\nhe came into the world, such as we seek also on coins, and\nif we find them, we approve of the coins, and if we do not\nfind the marks, we reject them. What is the stamp on\nthis Sestertius? The stamp of Trajan. Present it. It\nis the stamp of Nero. Throw it away: it cannot be\naccepted, it is counterfeit. So also in this case: What is\n\nthe stamp of his opinions? It is gentleness, a sociable disposition, a tolerant temper,\na disposition to mutual affection. Produce these qualities. I accept them: I consider\nthis man a citizen, I accept him as a neighbour, a com-\npanion in my voyages. Only see that he has not Nero's\nstamp. Is he passionate, is he full of resentment, is he\nfault-finding? If the whim seizes him, does he break the\nheads of those who come in his way? (If so), why then\ndid you say that he is a man? Is every thing judged\n(determined) by the bare form? If that is so, say that the\nform in wax is an apple and has the smell and the taste\nof an apple. But the external figure is not enough:\nneither then is the nose enough and the eyes to make the\nman, but he must have the opinions of a man. Here is\na man who does not listen to reason, who does not know\nwhen he is refuted: he is an ass: in another man the\nsense of shame is become dead: he is good for nothing, he\nis any thing rather than a man.
