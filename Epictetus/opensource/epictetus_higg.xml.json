I go and inquire what this\ninterpreter of nature says. Soon I cannot understand\n\nhis meaning; I seek one to interpret that. I call on\nhim to explain everything as clearly as if it were in\nLatin. Yet what right has this last interpreter to\nboast?  Nor has Chrysippus himself, so long as he\nonly interprets the will of nature, and does not follow\nit; and much less has his interpreter. For we have no\nneed of Chrysippus on his own account; but that, by\nhis means, we may apprehend the will of nature; just\nas no one values a diviner on his own account, but\nthat, by his assistance, men hope to understand future\nevents and heavenly indications; nor the auguries, on\ntheir own account, but on account of what is signified\nby them; neither is it the raven, or the crow, that is\nadmired, but the divine purposes displayed through\ntheir means. Thus I come to the diviner and interpreter of these higher things, and say, \"Inspect the\nauguries for me: what is signified for me?\"  Having\ntaken, and inspected them, he thus interprets them:\nYou have a free will, O man ! incapable of being restrained or compelled. This is written here in the\nauguries. I will show you this, first, in the faculty of\nassent. Can any one restrain you from assenting to\ntruth? No one. Can any one compel you to admit\na falsehood? No one. You see, then, that you have\nhere a free will, incapable of being restrained, or compelled, or hindered. Well, is it otherwise with regard\nto pursuit and desire? What can displace one pursuit. Another pursuit. What [can displace] desire\nand aversion? Another desire and another aversion.\n\n\"If you offer  as an alternative,\" say you, you\ncompel me. No, not the alternative does it, but\nyour conviction that it is better to do such a thing\nthan to die. Here, again, you see that it is your own\nconviction which compels you, - that is, choice compels choice; for if God had constituted that portion\nwhich he has separated from his own essence, and\ngiven to us, capable of being restrained or compelled,\neither by himself, or by any other, he would not have\nbeen God, nor have fitly cared for us."}, "These things, says the diviner, I find in the auguries. These things are announced to you. If you\nplease, you are free. If you please, you will have no\none to complain of, no one to accuse. All will be\nequally according to your own mind, and to the mind\nof God.", "For the sake of this oracle, I go to this diviner and\nphilosopher; admiring not alone him for his interpretation, but also the things which he interprets."]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "18", "head": "That we ought not to be angry with the erring.", "p": [{"pb": {"@id": "p.1063"}, "#text": "If what the philosophers say be true, that all men's\nactions proceed from one source; that as they\nassent from a persuasion that a thing is so, and\ndissent from a persuasion that it is not, and suspend\n\ntheir judgment from a persuasion that it is uncertain;\nso, likewise, they seek a thing from a persuasion that it\nis for their advantage, - and it is impossible to esteem\none thing advantageous, and yet desire another; to\nesteem one thing a duty, and yet pursue another,\nwhy, after all, should we be angry at the multitude?"}, "\"They are thieves and robbers.\"", "What do you mean by thieves and robbers?
