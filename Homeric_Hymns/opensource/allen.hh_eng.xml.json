It is natural to infer from this word that they were preludes, and  distinctly states that the Homerids prefaced their rhapsodising with a prooemium to Zeus; ; the scholiast  says that the rhapsodes as a rule began with a prooemium to Zeus, and sometimes with one to the Muses (so also schol.    ). Many also of the lesser hymns contain clear allusions to festivals and recitations (, , , , , , . See the notes on these passages). The minor hymns, both by these expressions and by their brevity, suggest that they were not used independently; two of greater length, those to Pan and Dionysus, rather belong to a religious ceremony in honour of those gods, and either is longer than the Adonis hymn in Theocritus xv. The twenty-sixth hymn (also to Dionysus) explicitly talks of the recurrence of the festival next year. These three hymns, therefore, seem to have no necessary connexion with recitations of Homer; and the same is even more the case with viii., xi., xii., xvii., xxii. (see the Introductions to these hymns). The usual view, therefore (expressed by Wolf  p. cvi), that all the hymns were preludes to the recitation of , cannot be maintained. This belief rested (besides on the passage of Pindar quoted above) on (i.) the meaning of the word ; this word, like many terms in music and the arts, may have shifted its significance, and like prelude in modern music have been used of an independent composition which bore a technical resemblance to an actual prelude. It is difficult to believe that the five greater hymns can have preluded a rhapsody not necessary longer than one of them. Wolf also relied (ii.) on Plutarch  1133 C .

There may have  been a , perhaps also known as Plutus (), connected with the great goddesses from very early times (Lenormant p. 856; Dyer p. 174). But we may safely conclude that Iacchus, who was either the brother of Persephone, or her son by Hades, was of little importance until a period subsequent to the age of the hymn (Gardner p. 385, after Lenormant). It follows that the hymn certainly preceded the introduction of Dionysiac rites at Eleusis, when Iacchus was identified with Dionysus (Bacchus). The procession of Iacchus from Athens to Eleusis was established by the time of the Persian war ( ); Lenormant is therefore probably correct in assigning the commencement of Dionysiac influence to the first half of the sixth century B.C. The insignificance of Triptolemus and Eumolpus, who are merely two of the Eleusinian chiefs, is also a sign of antiquity (see 153). On these grounds the hymn appears to belong to a date at least not later than the beginning of that century; Lenormant himself (p. 852) assigns it to the end of the eighth or the beginning of the seventh century. Most scholars are substantially in agreement with the view that the hymn is the work of the seventh century; e.g. Frster (p. 39), who suggests the first half, and Duncker ( iii. ch. 14), who favours the middle of the century.

The principal objection is perhaps the fact that, in the hymn, the descent of Persephone to the underworld takes place at Nysa, whereas local tradition laid the scene at Eleusis itself.

Apollodorus mentions Panyasis and Pherecydes as authorities for the genealogy of Triptolemus; he must therefore have collated their accounts, at least, with the Homeric hymn, and have adopted a composite version of the myth.

He believes that the hymn as it stands is a fusion of two distinct poems, one of which narrated the rape of Persephone without alluding to Eleusis and the mysteries, while the other treated the mourning  of Demeter and the institution of the Eleusinian cult (p. 2, 111). Puntoni apportions the lines of the hymn between these two earlier poems and the additions of a later editor. The grounds for this elaborate and minute dissection are quite illusory; they consist mainly in the supposed unsatisfactory position held by Hecate, and in a number of grammatical and logical incongruities in the text. The most tangible of these are in 53 and 58.

Editors have assumed a lacuna before 265 and after 267, or at all events after the lines. It was supposed that the lost passage or passages referred to the death of Demophon, or to his leadership in the war, or mediation between the parties. This supposition is quite gratuitous; 265 simply marks the time, when he has grown to manhood, and has no closer connexion with the preceding or succeeding lines. There is no trace in myth or history of an Eleusinian civil war; hence Matthiae (followed by Baumeister) substituted  for , assuming that Demophon was the leader of the Eleusinians in their war against Athens. The corruption is most improbable, not to mention the further difficulty that tradition made Eumolpus, not Demophon, the leader of the Eleusinians ( , Isocr.  19,  ,   24,  ). There are so few allusions to early Eleusinian history in Greek literature,  that it would not be surprising if mention of a civil war were found in this passage only. But Creutzer was no doubt right in explaining the lines by reference to the , or sham fight, which is expressly connected with Demophon by Hesychius s.v., .

Similar customs are quoted by Bather in  xiv. 253, Jevons p. 292. It need not be supposed that the origin of such  was always the same; in the present case the mystae may have stoned one another to draw blood as a means of communion with the Corn-goddess, or the blood may have been thought to increase the fertility of the land. The latter idea is probably at the root of some, if not all, of the numerous parallel examples which shew that fights, either sham or more serious, have taken place to ensure a good harvest. This, as a European custom, was first clearly demonstrated by Mannhardt  p. 548 f.; for instances from savage tribes see Frazer on  As often, the meaning of the rite was lost at Eleusis, where the mock-battle was supposed to commemorate an early civil war."}]}, {"@id": "cp2l265", "@type": "commline", "@n": "265", "p": {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "w(/rh|sin"}, "quote": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "tou= ge"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "tw=| ge"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "w(/rh|sin"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "w(/rh|sin pa/sh|si"}], "bibl": [{"@n": "HH 5.102", "title": "h.

As Frazer remarks (on  , p. 511) no later writer (than the hymn) and no inscription yet discovered speaks of such a temple. Various attempts have been made to identify this supposed temple with some of the pre-Persian remains discovered by the excavations of the Greek Archaeological Society. Frazer ( p. 509) doubtfully suggests that it may have been on the site of the later hall of initiation, where walls of Eleusinian marble have been unearthed. Remains of another early building, probably a temple, have been discovered north of the hall, and separated from it by a rock-cut staircase, leading up to the terrace. This building has also been thought to be the old temple of Demeter. It is possible that the  served also as a hall of initiation, which would of course be sacred to Demeter. In this case the building may be identified with the walls abovementioned, which belong to a building older than the age of Pisistratus; but it is impossible to judge of the form of this building from these scanty remains, or to conjecture how far it was a prototype of a later hall (probably built by Pisistratus), and of the enlarged Periclean hall.

Persephone of her own accord picks the fruit in a garden, and eats seven seeds. There is a widespread belief that the living may visit the underworld and return safely, provided that they abstain from the food of the dead. The Finnish hero Winminen refuses to drink in Manala, the place of the dead ( xvi. p. 293). In  Africa S. there is a similar story: a man visits spiritland and is warned to return before he meets one who will give him food (Leslie  p. 121). In New Zealand a Maori woman was thought to have come back from the dead, having by the advice of her father refused the food which the dead people offered her (Shortland  p. 150). The last story is quoted by Tylor  ii. p. 51, who gives a parallel among the Sioux of N. America. Several similar tales are collected by Hartland , ch. iii. (among the ancient Danes, in the Banks islands, and in the Hervey islands). Hartland remarks that there is the same objection to eating the food of the fairies (cf. Rhys  i. p. 290; see also  viii. p. 380;  iii. (Orkney and Shetland), p. 25, 27). Some other references are given by Frazer on  ; cf. also  x. p. 300 f. (Japan). The basis of the belief is the idea that a  common meal unites the partakers in a close bond; hence the sanctity of the relation between host and guest in primitive society. By eating any food in the underworld, Persephone established a bond with the dead. But there is no doubt a special significance in the particular fooda pomegranatealthough its precise meaning has been disputed. According to one view, the fruit, from the blood-red colour of the inside, is a symbol of blood and death. A pomegranate tree was planted over the graves of Menoeceus, a suicide ( ), and the unlucky Eteocles (in the latter case by the Erinyes,   ii. 29, i. 4). It was believed to have sprung from the blood of Dionysus Zagreus (   ii. 19). The fruit was therefore appropriate to the dead. Probably, however, it is here rather symbolical of marriage and fertility, from the multitude of its seeds; cf.  . It was the emblem of Hera, probably as goddess of marriage; the fruit expedited birth,   xxiii. 107; cf.  112 (of its flowers)  It was an attribute of Aphrodite (see Murr  p. 50 f., , Preller-Robert i.^{2} p. 763). Pausanias (ii. 17. 4) refuses to discuss the meaning of the fruit in the hand of the Argive Hera. The mystae at Eleusis abstained from eating it (Porphyr.  iv. 16) as did the Thesmophoriazusae (  ), and the banqueters at the Haloa (schol. Lucian  vii. 4; see Harrison  p. 148). The Arcadians would not bring the pomegranate into the temple of Despoina ( ). According to this view, the pomegranate would symbolise, not so much Persephone's general union with the dead, as her special union with Hades. In actual custom, the Greeks made wedding-cakes of sesame ( schol.   )."}, {"title": "Baumkultus", "#text": "For the pomegranate as an attribute of Persephone and Pluto in art see Preller-Robert i.^{2} p. 763 n. 2, Btticher  ch. 38."}, {"bibl": {"@n": "Ov.

In this passage, as in Pindar, Sophocles, Euripides and others, it seems to be distinctly claimed that mere initiation procures happiness in a future state; nothing, at all events, is said about the necessity of a virtuous life. Foucart (, etc. p. 65 f.) thinks that the object of the mysteries was essentially practical: the mystae were taught how to avoid the  dangers which beset the soul in its descent to Hades. He proves that such practical instructions formed part of the Orphic religion (p. 66 f.); but it is a most improbable hypothesis that the  at Eleusis were a kind of guide to Hades. Orphic doctrines did not obtain a hold on the Eleusinia until a later period than the date of this hymn. In any case, however, it is clear that, in the general opinion of the early mystae, actual communion with the deities of the underworld was the main, if not the only, essential to salvation. That this belief persisted, is evident from the criticism of Diogenes:  (Plutarch  4). See Rohde p. 271 f. The belief could, of course, be paralleled from the history of other religions. Serious and educated thinkers, at least in later times, believed that initiation in the Eleusinian or other mysteries was an incentive to virtue (e.g. ,  ; see Ramsay p. 125, Gardner p. 401); but Rohde (p. 275) considers that the language of Andocides ( ) is quite exceptional."}]}, {"@id": "cp2l486", "@type": "commline", "@n": "486", "p": {"quote": {"@lang": "greek", "emph": "me/g) o)/lbios", "#text": "ktl."}, "#text": ": cf. xxx. 7 (with 489 cf. xxx. 12, and with 494 cf. xxx. 18)."}}, {"@id": "cp2l489", "@type": "commline", "@n": "489", "p": [{"title": ["Theog.", "scolium"], "quote": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*plou/tou mhte/r' *)olumpi/an a)ei/dw"}, "#text": "Plutus is son of Demeter and Iasion,   969 f.

There he wished to found his oracle, but the nymph dissuaded him and suggested Crisa; he complied, and his temple was built beneath Parnassus. Hard by was a fountain, where he met a dragon which ravaged the place. This monster had reared Typhaon, whom Hera bare in wrath with Zeus. Apollo slew the dragon and gained his title of Pythius. Angry with Telphusa for her treachery in sending him to a place infested by the dragon, he returned to her and stopped her water with a shower of rocks from an overhanging cliff. Then he bethought him of a priesthood, and saw Cretans sailing from Cnossus. He met them in the form of a dolphin, and diverted the course of their ship to Crisa, where he revealed himself as a god.

Moreover, that the hymn was a single document by the time of Aristides is proved by the citations of his contemporaries, i.e. Pausanias (x. 37. 5 ) and Athenaeus (22 C, quoting v. 515, ).

One fact is certain, that the earlier part of the hymn was recited at a Delian festival to an Ionian audience. But at 182 the poem leaves Delos, which is not mentioned again, and passes to quite different episodes in Apollo's career, chief of which is the foundation of the Dorian oracle at Pytho. It may be argued that there is no reason why the Chian bard should not have dealt with these later achievements; he need not have been so parochial as to exclude from his Delian hymn all myths which do not bear on the god's connexion with the island. Again, if it be urged that some final reference to Delos might be expected at  the end of the whole poem, an answer is ready that such criticism is purely subjective, and that we must not force ancient documents to comply with modern ideas of artistic propriety. Even if there is a natural break at 178, the same author (i.e. the Chian poet) may have composed the rest of the hymn as a separate rhapsody; in this he handled myths, foreign, it is true, to Delos, but not foreign to his subject, which is after all not Delos, but Apollo.", {"title": ["panegyris", "mainland"], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "foot", "@n": "1", "@resp": "TWA", "#text": "See further on 20-24."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "foot", "@n": "1", "@resp": "TWA", "#text": "See on 214."}], "quote": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*pu/qia kai\\ *dh/lia, *pu/qion"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "tau=ta/ soi"}], "#text": "But, when all these conservative arguments have been allowed their due weight, it is still practically impossible to reverse the judgment of Ruhnken and his followers. The fatal objection to the theory of unity rests on historical and mythological grounds. As has been conceded above, there is no prima facie impossibility in supposing that a bard at Delos handled the theme of Apollo's victory over the dragon at Pytho. But the circumstances of the Delian  must be borne in mind: it was an assembly of Ionians (152); a certain non-Ionic element was indeed present, but these aliens came chiefly from the Aegean islands (see on 157), and the festival was, in fact, essentially insular. The character of the Delian part of the hymn is entirely in keeping with this insularity; Phoebus has many temples, and travels far and wide (141 f.); but his heart is in Delos (146), which he loves more than any other island, and more than the  (139). It is difficult to agree with Dr. Verrall's theory as to the meaning of the whole hymn (see below, p. 68); but he is undoubtedly right in laying stress on the fundamental difference between the Ionian religion of Apollo at Delos, and the Dorian religion at Pytho. In Dr. Verrall's words (p. 17), the Delian hymnist's range of view, and the government of his god are strictly limited, according to his own full and exact description (30-44, 142-145), to the Aegean archipelago. Even the coast of the surrounding land he treats merely as a framework enclosing the beloved islands; he mentions scarcely a point in the coast which is not peninsular, and within the sea-line knows nothing except what might be seen from the sea. His Ionians are mariners exclusively (155), and have a deity like themselves. Moreover, the Delian cult was not only Ionian and insular, but also in part oracular (see on 81); and it is barely conceivable  that a poet, who adopted the exclusive standpoint of the Delians, should have devoted the rest of his hymn (three times as large as the first part) to the praises of a rival Dorian oracle. At the present day we are apt to take a wrong perspective of early Apolline religiona perspective natural enough, inasmuch as it rests on authority which, though not so old as the hymn, is still ancient. Callimachus composed a catholic and eclectic hymn to Apollo, in which local and racial distinctions are blurred; still earlier, in the age of faith, Pindar and Aeschylus honoured Delos and Delphi equally, and tried to harmonise the two rival cults, following, perhaps, the example of statesmen like Pisistratus and Polycrates, who respected both the shrines ( Suid. s.v. , and ). But we cannot look for a quixotic spirit in a poet who must have preceded the age of Pindar by several generations, and who sang to an Ionian audience assembled in honour of a local and tribal god."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "foot", "@n": "2", "@resp": "TWA", "bibl": {"@n": "Paus. 2. 7. 7", "#text": "Paus.ii. 7. 7."}, "#text": "On the sacred drama representing this idea see Frazer on"}, "#text": "The Pythian part of the hymn, on the other hand, is Dorian and continental in its outlook (see below, p. 67 f.).

His themethe foundation of the most famous oracle in the worldoffered a splendid opportunity; but the hymn shows, by sins of omission and commission alike, that its writer could not rise to the level of his subject. Dr. Verrall (p. 6 f.) remarks that he passes over in silence almost everything characteristic of Pythothe chasm, the tripod, the omphalos, the crowds of worshippers, the priestess herself. To these omissions may be added the silence of the hymn on the purification of Apollo from blood-guiltiness, which was a primitive and important article of the Pythian religion. There is no explicit reference to the preApolline worship of Gaea or Themis (see on 300), and no word of Poseidon, who, unlike Dionysus, was at Pytho at an early date. This neglect of opportunities is ascribed by Dr. Verrall to the insincerity of the compiler of the present document; but it  may rather be due to the taste, or want of taste, of a writer who seems to have been chiefly interested in miracles and etymological speculation.

The passage, however, bears no signs of late workmanship: it is a fragment of genuine antiquity, although it has been forced into its present context with some violence. The hymn has thus been pieced together from three different sources; and, this being its history, there is of course a possibility that its component parts may have been even more numerous. Various German critics, from the time of Groddeck, have argued for this disintegration. None of these speculations, however, are more than plausible at best; nor are they recommended by any historical or mythological difficulties. Groddeck, for example, considered 1-13 to be a separate poem or fragment. But there is absolutely no reason why the Chian poet should not have composed this passage as the exordium of his hymn at Delos.

The date and authorship are, indeed, expressly mentioned by the scholiast on   , where the hymn is attributed to Cynaethus of Chios, who first rhapsodized the poems of Homer at Syracuse, in the sixty-ninth Olympiad (504 B.C.). The blind Chian may have been Cynaethus; we have, at all events, no reason to doubt the correctness of the scholiast's tradition in this respect; but the date is certainly far  too low. The evidence of history in connexion with the Ionian assembly, is usually brought forward as an argument for an early period; and this argument is of some weight, though not in itself conclusive. The  must have become famous by the beginning of the eighth century B.C., when the Messenians are said to have sent a secret embassy to Delos, and a hymn was composed for them by Eumelus of Corinth ( ). The Delian hymn to Apollo might therefore belong to this century, in which case it would be contemporary with some of the rejected epics. At this time, the Ionians on the coast of Asia Minor and in the islands attained the height of their prosperity. Duncker ( vol. ii. ch. 9) thinks that the hymn must be earlier than 700 B.C., when the Ionians suffered a shock from the invasion of Cimmerians. But the invaders did not reach the islands, although they ravaged a great part of Asia Minor; the festival was not apparently interrupted, and its splendour was even increased in the time of Polycrates and Pisistratus. It was not before the defeat of the Ionians by Persia that it declined in prestige, until it was revived by the Athenians at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war. History, therefore, would allow any date to the Delian hymn between the eighth century (or even earlier) and the time of Pisistratus. But the lower limit is impossible on other grounds; for, as we have seen, the hymn to Apollo is attributed to Homer by Thucydides, and probably also by Aristophanes. The first part of the hymn must thus be considerably older than the fifth century. This conclusion is supported by archaeological evidence, which points to a date not subsequent to 600 B.C.  The language, which has been exhaustively treated by various German scholars, has words and forms which do not occur in Homer; but on the whole it is Homeric in character, and seems to belong to a period when epic literature, if in its decline, was still a living force.

According to the common view (see Baumeister p. 115), the first hymn is the work of a Homerid, the second belongs to the Hesiodean school. Gemoll, on the other hand, very properly remarks that there are reminiscences of Hesiod in the Delian part, and that the whole document shows the influence of Homer. All that can be inferred from internal evidence is, that the author of the Pythian part was familiar with Delphi, whose situation is accurately described (283); further, the episode of Telphusa and the reference to the curious custom at Onchestus  are distinctly local, and seem to prove that the poem was composed on the mainland, and probably in central Greece. Its nearest analogy is the , which, if not genuinely Hesiodean, is certainly Boeotian.

As the Pythian hymn is so much concerned with Apollo's progress along the sacred way from Euboea to Delphi (see 214 f., 280), the local and religious interest of the two poems seems parallel.

As has been shown above, the hymn in its present composite form was known to the Greeks in the time of Pausanias and probably even of Thucydides. It would be interesting to know the date and nationality of the editor; and in this connexion Dr. Verrall has suggested an ingenious theory. In his view the hymn is a cento, divisible into at least four distinct parts, of which the oldest was a Delian hymn; an Athenian, under the dynasty of Pisistratus, collected from other sources, or added from his own pen, materials to form the present document. The compiler was influenced by religious and political motives, his object being to diminish the dignity of the Pythian oracle, and magnify the Delian cult of Apollo. The whole hymn, as there arranged, was an anti-Delphian religious pasquinade. This hypothesis cannot here be fully criticised; but most readers of Dr. Verrall's article will probably fail to be convinced that the hymn is not a genuine attempt to honour the Pythian, as well as the Delian, Apollo. At the same time, it is quite possible that the compiler was an Athenian in the age of Pisistratus. If we could unhesitatingly accept the tradition that the tyrant ordered a recension of Homer, the hymn to Apollo might have been edited, as well as the genuine Homeric poems, being itself classed as Homeric by common opinion. But the tendency of modern scholarship is to reject the tradition as unfounded. It is perhaps more natural to look for the editor in  a place where the two great myths of Apollothe birth at Delos and the fight with the Pythian dragonwere first united. This place was possibly Tegyra (see on 16); and Hiller von Grtringen (in Pauly-Wissowa 2538) suggests that not only was the Pythian hymn of Boeotian origin, but that the whole composition was put together in Tegyra or elsewhere in Boeotia."}, {"title": "The hymn in relation to later literature.", "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "foot", "@n": "1", "@resp": "TWA", "#text": "The passages quoted by Gemoll from Pindar may be quite independent; see on 73, 189."}, "#text": "VII.

The hymn had become a classic by the end of the fifth century, when Thucydides treats it as historical evidence of value, and Aristophanes' quotations imply that it was familiar to an Attic audience. The Alexandrian poets made free use of it in their revival of hymn-writing: the chief debtor was perhaps Callimachus, in his own hymns to Apollo and Delos (see on 19, 119, 135, 383, 396), but Apollonius and Theocritus also laid it under contribution (see on 119, 487).

The places are enumerated in a more or less orderly sequence; Leto starts from Crete, moves northwards by Aegina, Athens, and Euboea to Athos and Samothrace; she then returns southward, visiting Ida and taking on her way the chief islands of the Aegean and places in Asia Minor, until she reaches the most southerly group of islands; from Carpathos she moves in to Delos by way of Naxos, Paros, and Rheneia."]}, {"@id": "cp3l30", "@type": "commline", "@n": "30", "p": {"bibl": [{"@n": "Paus. 8. 48. 3", "#text": "Paus.viii. 48. 3"}, {"@n": "Plut.

The geography here is difficult. Haliartus lies between Onchestus and Ocalea, and the Cephissus or Melas flowed across the northern part of the Copais lake, and would not be crossed at any point by the road from Thebes to Panopeus. We can hardly with Ilgen suppose Apollo to have gone round the whole lake (e.g. to Tegyra) turning N. at this point; and the transpositions and excisions of other editors are even less available. The writer, like the author of the Catalogue, was indifferent to the order of places on a route (cf. his lists of places 30 f., 422 f.), and may therefore be allowed to have transposed Haliartus and Ocalea; but it is hard to imagine a poet whom there are grounds for calling Boeotian (Introd. p. 67 f.) making the stream which actually separates Onchestus and Haliartus (usually identified with the Lophis) into the Cephissus. By the date of the hymn no doubt the old Minyan system of drainage had broken down, and Copais had become, as it remained till a few years ago, in the winter a sheet of water, in the summer a dry swamp intersected by various rivers and canals. It may therefore be suggested (1) that the writer meant  for the lake, somewhat as in 280 he locates Panopeus , while it was in reality near the river; (2) or that the entire water-system, rivers and canals, may have been considered branches of the Cephissus, and that the southernmost canal with its tributaries (which came close to Haliartus and Onchestus, and actually joined the Melas at the NW. corner of the lake) may have been known by that name. Strabo 407 says distinctly that the Melas flows through the land of Haliartus. There was much confusion of names in this submerged country; even a resident antiquary like Plutarch ( 20,  16) mistook the Cephissus for the Melas, and Strabo 412 accuses Alcaeus of misplacing Onchestus and misspelling the name of a river.

The connexion lies simply in the fact that the episodes all deal with the first exploits of the infant god, and shew how, by his cunning and dexterity, he vindicated his birthright, and won the attributes which distinguished him in maturity. Hermes has perhaps the most complex character of any deity in Greek mythology, and the poet has tried to do justice to some, at least, of the god's many qualities. Of these, one of the most characteristic was thievishness. To the Greeks, who too often prided themselves on successful deceit, and who had made lying a fine art, a patron-deity of cunning came natural. Even in the later parts of the  Hermes is known as the Thief; cf. , where the gods urge him to steal the body of Hector.

Apollo presented Hermes with cattle, and in his turn received  the cithara (498 f.). The poet, too, felt that all forms of prophecy rightly belonged, under Zeus, to the Lord of Delphi. But he knew that, in common superstition, certain processes of divination were under the patronage of Hermes, the god of luck. He App. therefore naturally assumed that these lower powers had been delegated to Hermes from the abundance of Apollo's higher prerogative.

Some scholars, on the other hand, argue that the hymn was the sole ultimate authority, and that the variations of detail are the invention of the mythographer. Gemoll, who supports this view, believes that these variations partly proceed from carelessness, as (3), partly from a desire to explain or amplify the hymn; e.g. the variant (2) is due to Apollodorus' wish to utilise the cows, and so connect the two incidents of the cithara and the cattlestealing. Gemoll also assumes, with no adequate reason, that Apollodorus used a text with the present lacunae in the hymn. The differences between the two accounts seem too wide to admit the theory that Apollodorus used no other source; indeed, it may be doubted whether he was even at all acquainted with the actual text of the hymn, although he may have borrowed from sources (written or oral) which were ultimately drawn from the Homeric version."}, {"quote": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "po/rtias, 100 bo/as a)/zugas"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "u(/lh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "w(s a)\\n ta\\ i)/xnh tw=n bow=n a)fani/sh|"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*ni/kandros e(teroioume/nwn a/, *(hsi/odos e)n mega/lais h)oi/ais, *didu/marxos metamorfwse/wn g/, *)anti/gonos e)n tai=s a)lloiw/sesi, kai\\ *)apollw/nios o( *(ro/dios e)n e)pigra/mmasin"}], "bibl": {"@n": "Ov.

Antoninus gives a long itinerary, starting from Phthiotis and ending at the Messenian Pylos; there Hermes hides the cattle in a cave at Coryphasium in which  Nestor had housed his booty (,  ). The meeting with Battus took place near Maenalus. Thus a Pylos is mentioned in both versions as in the neighbourhood of Hermes' cave.

The date is equally uncertain, but there is every reason to believe, with the consensus of scholars, that the poem is later than the rest of the longer hymns.

See also Eberhard  ii. p. 34 f., and n. on 92; Pref. p. lxix. Definite evidence of date has been sought for in the mention of the seven-stringed cithara (51). The adoption of seven in place of four strings is usually ascribed to Terpander (see Flach  i. 195), who was an old man in  =676 B.C.; Smyth  p. 165 (but see Timotheus  ). Even  if this form of the cithara is older than Terpander, who probably only modified the scale (Smyth ), it is highly probable that the hymn is much later than that poet. As Gemoll remarks (p. 193), the hymn-writer could not have attributed the seven strings to Hermes, had not the cithara been long established in that form. On the other hand, the hymn does not approach the childishness of the  (attributed to Pigres, , by Plutarch and Suidas), nor to the comic effects of fourth-century parody; still less is it Alexandrian. It is excellent and vigorous literature of an early period, and its cynical and quasi-parodic style make it unique. Its language is in places prosaic, but a high flight of poetic fancy would be foreign to the theme. The moral tone appears low when judged by modern standardsas low, perhaps, as that of the Lay of Demodocus (see  Introd.). But this was no stumbling-block to the average Greek, who acquiesced in gods made after his own image. The hymn-writer, in fact, frankly represents the popular religion; he is no opponent of it, like Euripides, nor scoffer, like Lucian.

As Gemoll notes, the skins were probably exhibited  the cave, which would negative the theory of stalactites (see below). Instances of such relics are quoted in  xvii. p. 257 (e.g. the skin of Marsyas,  ); to these may be added   4 (the horns of a cow dedicated by Servius Tullius in the temple of Diana on the Aventine),  (Leda's egg)(bones of Pelops)(plane-tree at Aulis), schol.

Robertson Smith ( rev. ed. p. 306) remarks that Hermes is called  (436, where see note), and that the story seems to be one of the many legends about the origin of sacrifice. The present passage, however, appears only to allude to the institution of sacrifice to the twelve gods, with special reference to Hermes' inclusion in the number (see on 128). Further, although Robertson Smith proves the sanctity of oxen in early times, it does not seem that the idea is present here. The sanctity would be violated by killing as well as by eating oxen; whereas Hermes has no scruple in killing, but only refrains from  eating. The passage may imply that Hermes was unwilling to eat the flesh of  animal; he was honoured  Theopomp. ap. Porphyr.  ii. 16 (at Methydrion); milk and honey were offered to him (cf.  ix. 72, 318 and 744). It is true that animals were also sacrificed to Hermes, e.g. a ram (Sauppe , ausgewhlte Schrift. p. 274), and a goat at Eleusis ( i. 5), cf. a vase in the  B. M. (Cat.ii. B 362), and victims were offered at Cyllene (Gemin.  i. 14); so in Homeric times  (lambs and goats); but the local ritual recorded by the writer may have demanded a bloodless sacrifice. Otherwise we must accept Gemoll's explanation that Hermes is humorously placed in an awkward predicament: he has sacrificed to the twelve gods, and is now about to begin his meal, like a human sacrificer; but he remembers in time that he is himself one of the twelve, who have to be content with the savour of sacrifice, without its substancc."}, "Apollodorus (iii. 10. 2) does not follow the hymn; see Introd. p. 130."]}, {"@id": "cp4l133", "@type": "commline", "@n": "133", "p": {"emph": {"quote": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*per=hn"}}, "quote": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pe/rhn)"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "perh=nai"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "perai/nw"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pera=n"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pe/rhn"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pe/rhn kata/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e(/rkos o)do/ntwn"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "kaqi/hmi"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "laukani/hs kaqe/hka"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "i(mei/ronti/ per ei(=n)"}], "bibl": [{"@n": "Hom.

Some (e.g. Abel) hold that the writer of the hymn was the imitator; Gemoll and others think it scarcely doubtful that the hymn to Aphrodite is the older. The latter view seems the more probable.

According to Groddeck, who is followed by various scholars, including Abel and Fick ( ix. p. 200), the hymn is Cyprian. It is pointed out that Aphrodite is called the goddess of Cyprus in 2, 292, and the rare word  in 13 is supposed to be Cyprian. No argument, however, can be based on the occurrence of the title , which is Homeric, and, like , belongs to the common stock of divine epithets (cf. vi. 2 and 18; x. 1 ). The Cyprian origin of  is also very dubious (see on 13); and in any case a word used by Anacreon and Euripides need not be considered distinctly local, even in early poetry."}, {"title": "Hist. Greek Lit.", "#text": "Others (Matthiae, O. Mller, etc.) place the home of the author in Asia Minor, and believe the poem to have been recited in honour of a chieftain who claimed descent from Aeneas. But the hymn bears no trace of having been composed for a definite occasion, or in honour of a particular person. The allusion of the revived Trojan kingdom in 196 f. is quite vague, and is  merely a reminiscence of the Homeric tradition. Many, without committing themselves to the Trojan theory, believe that the author was an Ionian, or at least lived in Asia Minor. This is as likely as the Cyprian view, and as equally incapable of proof. The myth handled by the poet is not local, but Homeric; the love of Aphrodite and Anchises was famous wherever Homer was known. The language may be very pure Ionicalmost Homeric-Greek, but it does not follow that the composer was an Asiatic, as Prof. Mahaffy argues ( i. p. 148). At a time when the epics had become the property of the whole Greek-speaking world, the author of such a hymn might have belonged to any branch of the Hellenic stock. The further argument of those who see a contamination of Aphrodite with the Asiatic Cybele is unsound. It is true that Aphrodite was probably, in the Troad, another form of Cybele (Farnell p. 641), and as a nature-goddess had power over all the brute creation; but the hymn-writer is influenced by the Homeric conception of the goddess, and for Homer Aphrodite is far removed from Cybele. As Gemoll observes, the goddess is called a daughter of Zeus, and her train of beasts is a mere imitation of the animals which follow Circe (see on 69)."}, {"title": "State of the text.", "#text": "The general unity of the hymn is so obvious that it has suffered little from the higher criticism.

For a full comparison see Ludwich p. 61-67).

The double title  (in DELIIT) reminds us of similar alternatives in Theocritus and Herondas; but this title is not given by M, and is probably a later addition. Nor is there any proof that such titles were first adopted by the Alexandrines. In style, the hymn has little in common with the works of Callimachus or the hymnic idylls of Theocritus; its simplicity and directness of expression, which often pass into abruptness, differentiate it from any characteristic product of the Alexandrine age.

Ruhnken, Hermann, and a large majority of the older scholars assigned it a place among the Orphic poems.

Recent students of the  refuse to class it in the Orphic category (Maass  p. 198, Abel  p. 91, who dates it as in or after the age of Nonnus, Adami p. 223 f.). The accumulation of epithets is of course a marked characteristic of the Orphic school; but it is pointed out that this feature is not confined to the  (Maass and Adami, ; see on ). There is, however, little or nothing in the hymn to distinguish it from the acknowledged works of the Orphics; as Gemoll remarks, the first half is exactly in their style, and the prayer that Ares may remove  is really a prayer for peace, similar to that in  lxv (see on 12, 16). The inference is that the writer, if not a genuine Orphic, was at least steeped in the literature of that sect."}, "The cause which led to the inclusion of this hymn among Homeric poems is by no means evident. According to one view, the compiler of the collection was ignorant of the very plain distinction between an Orphic and an Homeric hymn. In this case Gemoll argues that the present form of the collection must belong to a very late age; for the Alexandrines, who knew some of the short hymns, would have had more critical acumen than to confuse the two kinds of hymns, even if the hymn to Ares  were not later than the Alexandrine period. According to another theory, the presence of the hymn is caused by the juxtaposition of Homeric and Orphic poems in a manuscript, which led to the misplacement of one hymn.", "If the presence of the hymn is not due to this purely accidental cause, the compiler of the collection must have had some reason for the choice of this particular hymn. It may be suggested that he was influenced by mythological considerations. The cult of Ares was of so little importance, that it would not be surprising if no genuine Homeric prelude in honour of the god were ready to hand. The compiler, however, may have been anxious that his collection should not lack mythological completeness; he was therefore compelled to search further afield for recognition of Ares' claims.

It is true that Pan is one of the oldest creations of Greek folklore, being (as Mannhardt has shewn) the representative in Greece of the numerous wood-spirits who appear in a semi-caprine form. But the old Arcadian woodspirit and shepherd-god had no place in the higher mythology of Homer and Hesiod, and scarcely won any recognition in literature before the Persian wars. Until that period he was probably ignored by cultivated Greeks (outside Arcadia), and hence Herodotus was led to infer that Pan was one of the most recent of Hellenic deities (ii. 145). In Pindar he is a mere attendant of the  ( ,  ). The first reference to the god is quoted from Epimenides, who called Pan and Arcas the twin-sons of Zeus and Callisto (schol. on , schol. on ). It is difficult to believe that a hymn which shews so developed a conception of Pan's nature and of his place in the Greek mythological system could have been the product of the seventh or early sixth century, in which all other literature passes over the god in silence.

Groddeck thought that the narrative languished in the latter half; to this Ilgen rightly replied that the comparative failure of interest is due to the subject, not to a different composer.
