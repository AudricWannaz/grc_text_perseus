            "0":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Simonides, the poet, once paid a visit to Hiero, the despot. When both found\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime to spare, Simonides said: Hiero, will you please explain something to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme that you probably know better than I? \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t And pray what is it, said Hiero, that I can know better than one so wise\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas yourself? \n\t\t\t\t",
            "1":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t I know you were born a private citizen, he answered, and are now a despot. Therefore, as you have\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texperienced both fortunes, you probably know better than I how the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlives of the despot and the citizen differ as regards the joys and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsorrows that fall to man’s lot. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t",
            "2":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Surely, said Hiero, seeing that you are still\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta private citizen, it is for you to remind me of what happens in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcitizen’s life; and then, I think, I could best show you the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferences between the two. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t",
            "3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Well, said Simonides, taking the suggestion, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t I think I have observed that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsights affect private citizens with pleasure and pain through the eyes,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsounds through the ears, smells through the nostrils, meat and drink through\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe mouth, carnal appetites—of course we all know how. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In the case of cold and heat, things hard and soft, light and heavy, our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsensations of pleasure and pain depend on the whole body, I think. In good\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand evil we seem to feel pleasure or pain, as the case may be—sometimes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the instrumentality of the moral being only, at other times through\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat of the moral and the physical being together. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "5":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Sleep, it seems clear to me, affects us with pleasure; but how and by what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeans and when are puzzles that I feel less able to solve. And perhaps it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno matter for surprise if our sensations are clearer when we are awake than\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen we are asleep. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "6":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t For my part, Simonides, said Hiero in answer to this, I cannot say how a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespot could have any sensations apart from those you have mentioned. So\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfar, therefore, I fail to see that the despot’s life differs in any respect\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the citizen’s. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t In this respect it does differ, said Simonides: the pleasures it\n\t\t\t\t\t\texperiences by means of these various organs are infinitely greater in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber, and the pains it undergoes are far fewer. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t It is not so, Simonides, retorted Hiero; I assure you far fewer pleasures\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfall to despots than to citizens of modest means, and many more and much\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreater pains. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Incredible! exclaimed Simonides. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "8":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Were it so, how should a despot’s throne be an object of desire to many,\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven of those who are reputed to be men of ample means? And how should all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe world envy despots? \n\t\t\t\t",
            "9":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t For this reason of course, said Hiero, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t that they speculate on the subject\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout experience of both estates. But I will try to show you that I am\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeaking the truth, beginning with the sense of sight. That was your first\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoint, if I am not mistaken. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "10":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t In the first place, then, taking the objects that we perceive by means of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvision, I find by calculation that in regard to sight-seeing, despots are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworse off. In every land there are things worth seeing: and in search of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese private citizens visit any city they choose, and attend the national\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfestivals, where all things reputed to be most worth seeing are assembled. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t",
            "11":"\n\t\t\t\t\t But despots are not at all concerned with missions to shows. For it is risky\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor them to go where they will be no stronger than the crowd, and their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproperty at home is too insecure to be left in charge of others while they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare abroad. For they fear to lose their throne, and at the same time to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunable to take vengeance on the authors of the wrong. Perhaps you may say: \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t",
            "12":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t But, after all, such spectacles come to them even if they stay at home. No,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno, Simonides, only one in a hundred such; and what there are of them are\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffered to despots at a price so exorbitant that showmen who exhibit some\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrifle expect to leave the court in an hour with far more money than they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tget from all the rest of the world in a lifetime. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "13":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Ah, said Simonides, but if you are worse off in the matter of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsight-seeing, the sense of hearing, you know, gives you the advantage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPraise, the sweetest of all sounds, is never lacking, for all your courtiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpraise everything you do and every word you utter. Abuse, on the contrary,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat most offensive of sounds, is never in your ears, for no one likes to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeak evil of a despot in his presence. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "14":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t And what pleasure, asked Hiero, comes, do you suppose, of this shrinking\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom evil words, when one knows well that all harbour evil thoughts against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe despot, in spite of their silence? Or what pleasure comes of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpraise, do you think, when the praises sound suspiciously like flattery? \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t",
            "15":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Well yes, replied Simonides, in this of course I agree with you entirely,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHiero, that praise from the freest is sweetest. But this, now, you will not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersuade anyone to believe, that the things which support human life do not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyield you a far greater number of pleasures. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "16":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Yes, Simonides, and I know that the reason why most men judge that we have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore enjoyment in eating and drinking than private citizens is this; they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink that they themselves would find the dinner served at our table better\n\t\t\t\t\t\teating than what they get. Anything, in fact, that is better than what they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare accustomed to gives them pleasure. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "17":"\n\t\t\t\t\t This is why all men look forward to the festivals, except the despots. For\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir table is always laden with plenty, and admits of no extras on feast\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdays. Here then is one pleasure in respect of which they are worse off than\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe private citizen, the pleasure of anticipation. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "18":"\n\t\t\t\t\t But further, your own experience tells you, I am sure, that the greater the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of superfluous dishes set before a man, the sooner a feeling of\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepletion comes over him; and so, as regards the duration of his pleasure\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoo, the man who has many courses put before him is worse off than the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoderate liver. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "19":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t But surely, said Simonides, so long as the appetite holds out, the man who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdines at the costlier banquet has far more pleasure than he who is served\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the cheaper meal. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "20":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Don’t you think, Simonides, that the greater a man’s pleasure in any\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toccupation the stronger is his devotion to it? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Certainly. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Then do you notice that despots fall to their meal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith any more zest than private persons to theirs? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t No, no, of course not; I should rather say with more\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisgust, according to the common opinion. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "21":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Well now, said Hiero, have you observed all those pickles and sauces that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare put before despots—acid, bitter, astringent and so forth? \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Yes, certainly; and very unnatural cates I think them for human beings. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t",
            "22":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Don’t you look on these condiments, then, as mere fads of a jaded and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpampered appetite? I know well enough, and I expect you know too,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat hearty eaters have no need of these concoctions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t",
            "23":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Well, I certainly think that those costly unguents with which you anoint\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour bodies afford more satisfaction to those who are near you than to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyourselves, just as the man who has eaten rank food is less conscious of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisagreeable smell than those who come near him. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "24":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Quite so, and we may add that he who has all sorts of food at all times has\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno stomach for any sort. Offer a man a dish that he seldom tastes, and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\teats a bellyful with gusto. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "25":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t It seems, remarked Simonides, as if the satisfaction of the sexual\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappetites were the only motive that produces in you the craving for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespotism. For in this matter you are free to enjoy the fairest that meets\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour eye. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "26":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t I assure you that we are worse off than private citizens in the matter to\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich you now refer. First take marriage. It is commonly held that a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarriage into a family of greater wealth and influence is most honourable,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand is a source of pride and pleasure to the bridegroom. Next to that comes\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta marriage with equals. A marriage with inferiors is considered positively\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdegrading and useless. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "27":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Now unless a despot marries a foreign girl, he is bound to marry beneath him;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand so the thing to be desired does not come his way. And whereas it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\texceedingly pleasant to receive the attentions of the proudest of ladies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe attentions of slaves are quite unappreciated when shown, and any little\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshortcomings produce grievous outbursts of anger and annoyance. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "28":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t In his relations with young boys, again, even much more than in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelations with women, the despot is at a disadvantage. We all know, I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuppose, that passion increases the sweets of sex beyond measure. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "29":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Passion, however, is very shy of entering the heart of a despot, for passion\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis fain to desire not the easy prize, but the hoped-for joy. Therefore, just\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a man who is a stranger to thirst can get no satisfaction out of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrinking, so he who is a stranger to passion is a stranger to the sweetest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpleasures of sex. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "30":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t To this speech of Hiero’s Simonides replied, laughing:\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t How say you, Hiero? You deny that love for boys springs up in a despot’s\n\t\t\t\t\t\theart? Then how about your passion for Dailochus, whom they call most fair? \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t",
            "31":"\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Why, Simonides, the explanation, of course, is this: I desire to get from\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim not what I may have, apparently, for the asking, but that which a despot\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be the last to take. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "32":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The fact is, I desire of Dailochus just that which human nature, maybe,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrives us to ask of the fair. But what I long to get, I very strongly desire\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto obtain by his goodwill, and with his consent; but I think I could sooner\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesire to do myself an injury than to take it from him by force. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "33":"\n\t\t\t\t\t For to take from an enemy against his will is, I think, the greatest of all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpleasures, but favours from a loved one are very pleasant, I fancy, only\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen he consents. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "34":"\n\t\t\t\t\t For instance, if he is in sympathy with you, how pleasant are his looks, how\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpleasant his questions and his answers; how very pleasant and ravishing are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe struggles and bickerings. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "35":"\n\t\t\t\t\t But to take advantage of a favourite against his will seems to me more like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrigandage than love. Nay, your brigand finds some pleasure in his gain and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin hurting his foe; but to feel pleasure in hurting one whom you love, to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\thated for your affection, to disgust him by your touch, surely that is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmortifying experience and pitiful! \n\t\t\t\t",
            "36":"\n\t\t\t\t\t The fact is, a private citizen has instant proof that any act of compliance\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the part of his beloved is prompted by affection, since he knows that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservice rendered is due to no compulsion; but the despot can never feel sure\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he is loved. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "37":"\n\t\t\t\t\t For we know that acts of service prompted by fear copy as closely as possible\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ministrations of affection. Indeed, even plots against despots as often\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas not are the work of those who profess the deepest affection for them. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t"
