        "1":"Release from this weary task of mine has been my plea to the gods throughout this long year’s watch, in which, lying upon the palace roof of the Atreidae, upon my bent arm, like a dog, I have learned to know well the gathering of the night’s stars, those radiant potentates conspicuous in the firmament,",
        "2":"bringers of winter and summer to mankind the constellations, when they rise and set .\n So now I am still watching for the signal-flame, the gleaming fire that is to bring news from Troy and",
        "3":"tidings of its capture. For thus commands my queen, woman in passionate heart and man in strength of purpose. And whenever I make here my bed, restless and dank with dew and unvisited by dreams—for instead of sleep fear stands ever by my side,",
        "4":"so that I cannot close my eyelids fast in sleep—and whenever I care to sing or hum (and thus apply an antidote of song to ward off drowsiness), then my tears start forth, as I bewail the fortunes of this house of ours, not ordered for the best as in days gone by.",
        "5":"But tonight may there come a happy release from my weary task! May the fire with its glad tidings flash through the gloom!\n \n The signal fire suddenly flashes out \n Oh welcome, you blaze in the night, a light as if of day, you harbinger of many a choral dance in Argos in thanksgiving for this glad event!\n \n ",
        "6":"Hallo! Hallo! \n To Agamemnon’s queen I thus cry aloud the signal to rise from her bed, and as quickly as she can to lift up in her palace halls a shout of joy in welcome of this fire, if the city of Ilium \n ",
        "7":"truly is taken, as this beacon unmistakably announces. And I will make an overture with a dance upon my own account; for my lord’s lucky roll I shall count to my own score, now that this beacon has thrown me triple six.\n Ah well, may the master of the house come home and may",
        "8":"I clasp his welcome hand in mine! For the rest I stay silent; a great ox stands upon my tongue —yet the house itself, could it but speak, might tell a plain enough tale; since, for my part, by my own choice I have words for those who know, and to those who do not know, I’ve lost my memory. He descends by an inner stairway; attendants kindle fires at the altars placed in front of the palace. Enter the chorus of Argive Elders \n \n ",
        "9":"This is now the tenth year since Priam’s mighty adversary, king Menelaus, and with him king Agamemnon, the mighty pair of Atreus’ sons, joined in honor of throne and sceptre by Zeus,",
        "10":"set forth from this land with an army of a thousand ships manned by Argives, a warrior force to champion their cause. \n Loud rang the battle-cry they uttered in their rage, just as eagles scream which,",
        "11":"in lonely grief for their brood, rowing with the oars of their wings, wheel high over their bed, because they have lost the toil of guarding their nurslings’ nest.\n \n ",
        "12":"But some one of the powers supreme—Apollo perhaps or Pan, or Zeus—hears the shrill wailing scream of the clamorous birds, these sojourners in his realm, and against the transgressors sends vengeance at last though late.",
        "13":"Even so Zeus, whose power is over all, Zeus, lord of host and guest, sends against Alexander the sons of Atreus, that for the sake of a woman with many husbands he may inflict many and wearying struggles (when the knee is pressed in the dust and",
        "14":"the spear is splintered in the onset) on Danaans and on Trojans alike.\n The case now stands where it stands—it moves to fulfilment at its destined end. Not by offerings burned in secret, not by secret libations,",

        "16":"supporting on our canes a strength like a child’s. For just as the vigor of youth, leaping up within the breast, is like that of old age, since the war-god is not in his place; so extreme age, its leaves",
        "17":"already withering, goes its way on triple feet, and, no better than a child, wanders, a dream that is dreamed by day.\n ",

        "25":"the single-minded captains of Hellas ’ youth, with avenging spear and arm against the Teucrian land, was sent off by the inspiring omen appearing to the kings of the ships—kingly birds,",

        "27":"caught in the last effort to escape. \n \n Sing the song of woe, the song of woe, but may the good prevail!\n ",
        "28":"\n Then the wise seer of the host, noticing how the two warlike sons of Atreus were two in temper, recognized the devourers of the hare as the leaders of the army, and",
        "29":"thus interpreted the portent and spoke: In time those who here issue forth shall seize Priam’s town, and fate shall violently ravage before its towered walls all the public store of cattle.",
        "30":"Only may no jealous god-sent wrath cast its shadow upon the embattled host, the mighty bit forged for Troy ’s mouth, and strike it before it reaches its goal!",
        "31":"For, in her pity, holy Artemis is angry at the winged hounds of her father, for they sacrifice a wretched timorous thing, together with her young, before she has brought them forth. An abomination to her is the eagles’ feast. \n Sing the song of woe, the song of woe, but may the good prevail!\n ",
        "32":"Although, O Lovely One, you are so gracious to the tender whelps of fierce lions, and take delight in the suckling young of every wild creature that roams the field, promise that the issue be brought to pass in accordance with these signs, portents",
        "33":"auspicious yet filled with ill. And I implore Paean , the healer, that she may not raise adverse gales with long delay to stay the Danaan fleet from putting forth,",
        "34":"by urging another sacrifice, one that knows no law, unsuited for feast, worker of family strife, dissolving wife’s reverence for husband. For there abides wrath—",
        "35":"terrible, not to be suppressed, a treacherous guardian of the home, a wrath that never forgets and that exacts vengeance for a child. \n Such utterances of doom, derived from auguries on the march, together with many blessings, did Calchas proclaim to the royal house; and in harmony with this,\n Sing the song of woe, the song of woe, but may the good prevail!\n ",
        "36":"Zeus, whoever he may be,—if by this name it pleases him to be invoked, by this name I call to him—as I weigh all things in the balance, I have nothing to compare",
        "37":"save Zeus, if in truth I must cast aside this vain burden from my heart.\n ",
        "38":"He who once was mighty, swelling with insolence for every fight,",
        "39":"he shall not even be named as having ever existed; and he who arose later, he has met his overthrower and is past and gone. But whoever willingly sings a victory song for Zeus,",
        "40":"he shall gain wisdom altogether,—\n ",
        "41":"\n Zeus, who sets mortals on the path to understanding, Zeus, who has established as a fixed law that wisdom comes by suffering. But even as trouble, bringing memory of pain, drips over the mind in sleep,",
        "42":"so wisdom comes to men, whether they want it or not. Harsh, it seems to me, is the grace of gods enthroned upon their awful seats.\n ",
        "43":"\n So then the captain of the Achaean ships, the elder of the two—",
        "44":"holding no seer at fault, bending to the adverse blasts of fortune, when the Achaean folk, on the shore over against Chalcis \n ",
        "45":"in the region where Aulis ’ tides surge to and fro, were very distressed by opposing winds and failing stores.\n ",
        "46":"\n The breezes that blew from the Strymon, bringing harmful leisure, hunger, and tribulation of spirit in a cruel port, idle wandering of men, and sparing neither ship",
        "47":"nor cable, began, by doubling the season of their stay, to rub away and wither the flower of Argos ; and when the seer, pointing to Artemis as cause, proclaimed to the chieftains another remedy,",
        "48":"more oppressive even than the bitter storm, so that the sons of Atreus struck the ground with their canes and did not stifle their tears—\n ",
        "49":"Then the elder king spoke and said: It is a hard fate to refuse obedience, and hard, if I must slay my child, the glory of my home, and at the altar-side stain",
        "50":"a father’s hand with streams of virgin’s blood. Which of these courses is not filled with evil? How can I become a deserter to my fleet and fail my allies in arms?",
        "51":"For that they should with all too impassioned passion crave a sacrifice to lull the winds—even a virgin’s blood—stands within their right. May all be for the best. \n ",
        "52":"\n But when he had donned the yoke of Necessity, with veering of mind,",
        "53":"impious, unholy, unsanctified, from that moment he changed his intention and began to conceive that deed of uttermost audacity. For wretched delusion, counsellor of ill, primal source of woe, makes mortals bold. So then he hardened his heart to sacrifice his daughter",
        "54":"so that he might further a war waged to avenge a woman, and as an offering for the voyage of a fleet!\n ",
        "55":"\n For her supplications, her cries of Father, and her virgin life,",
        "56":"the commanders in their eagerness for war cared nothing. Her father, after a prayer, bade his ministers lay hold of her as, enwrapped in her robes, she lay fallen forward,",
        "57":"and with stout heart to raise her, as if she were a young goat, high above the altar; and with a gag upon her lovely mouth to hold back the shouted curse against her house—\n ",
        "58":"\n by the bit’s strong and stifling might.\n Then, as she shed to earth her saffron robe, she",
        "59":"struck each of her sacrificers with a glance from her eyes beseeching pity, looking as if in a picture, wishing she could speak; for she had often sung where men met at her father’s hospitable table,",
        "60":"and with her virgin voice would lovingly honor her dear father’s prayer for blessing at the third libation —\n ",
        "61":"\n What happened next I did not see and do not tell. The art of Calchas was not unfulfilled.",
        "62":"Justice inclines her scales so that wisdom comes at the price of suffering. But the future, that you shall know when it occurs; till then, leave it be—it is just as someone weeping ahead of time. Clear it will come, together with the light of dawn. Enter Clytaemestra \n \n \n ",
        "63":"But as for what shall follow, may the issue be happy, even as she wishes, our sole guardian here, the bulwark of the Apian land, who stands nearest to our lord.\n ",
        "64":"\n I have come, Clytaemestra, in obedience to your royal authority; for it is fitting to do homage to the consort of a sovereign prince",
        "65":"when her husband’s throne is empty. Now whether the news you have heard is good or ill, and you do make sacrifice with hopes that herald gladness, I wish to hear; yet, if you would keep silence, I make no complaint.\n ",
        "66":"\n As herald of gladness, with the proverb,",
        "67":"may Dawn be born from her mother Night! You shall hear joyful news surpassing all your hopes—the Argives have taken Priam’s town!\n ",
        "68":"\n What have you said? The meaning of your words has escaped me, so incredible they seemed.\n ",
        "69":"\n I said that Troy is in the hands of the Achaeans. Is my meaning clear?\n ",
        "70":"Joy steals over me, and it challenges my tears.\n ",
        "71":"\n Sure enough, for your eye betrays your loyal heart.\n ",
        "72":"\n What then is the proof? Have you evidence of this?\n ",
        "73":"\n I have, indeed; unless some god has played me false.\n ",
        "74":"\n Do you believe the persuasive visions of dreams?\n ",
        "75":"I would not heed the fancies of a slumbering brain.\n ",
        "76":"\n But can it be some pleasing rumor that has fed your hopes?\n ",
        "77":"\n Truly you scorn my understanding as if it were a child’s.\n ",
        "78":"\n But at what time was the city destroyed?\n ",
        "79":"\n In the night, I say, that has but now given birth to this day here.\n ",
        "80":"And what messenger could reach here with such speed?\n ",
        "81":"\n Hephaestus, from Ida speeding forth his brilliant blaze. Beacon passed beacon on to us by courier-flame: Ida, to the Hermaean crag in Lemnos ; to the mighty blaze upon the island succeeded, third,",
        "82":"the summit of Athos sacred to Zeus; and, soaring high aloft so as to leap across the sea, the flame, travelling joyously onward in its strength \nthe pinewood torch, its golden-beamed light, as another sun, passing the message on to the watchtowers of Macistus.",
        "83":"He, delaying not nor carelessly overcome by sleep, did not neglect his part as messenger. Far over Euripus’ stream came the beacon-light and signalled to the watchmen on Messapion. They, kindling a heap of",
        "84":"withered heather, lit up their answering blaze and sped the message on. The flame, now gathering strength and in no way dimmed, like a radiant moon overleaped the plain of Asopus to Cithaeron’s ridges, and roused another relay of missive fire.",
        "85":"Nor did the warders there disdain the far-flung light, but made a blaze higher than their commands. Across Gorgopus’ water shot the light, reached the mount of Aegiplanctus, and urged the ordinance of fire to make no delay.",
        "86":"Kindling high with unstinted force a mighty beard of flame, they sped it forward so that, as it blazed, it passed even the headland that looks upon the Saronic gulf; until it swooped down when it reached the lookout, near to our city, upon the peak of Arachnaeus; and",
        "87":"next upon this roof of the Atreidae it leapt, this very fire not undescended from the Idaean flame.\n Such are the torch-bearers I have arranged, completing the course in succession one to the other; and the victor is he who ran both first and last. \n ",
        "88":"This is the kind of proof and token I give you, the message of my husband from Troy to me.\n ",
        "89":"\n Lady, my prayers of thanksgiving to the gods I will offer soon. But as I would like to hear and satisfy my wonder at your tale straight through to the end, so may you tell it yet again.\n ",
        "90":"This day the Achaeans hold Troy . Within the town there sounds loud, I believe, a clamor of voices which will not blend. Pour vinegar and oil into the same vessel and you will say that, as foes, they keep apart; so the cries of vanquished and victors greet the ear,",
        "91":"distinct as their fortunes are diverse. Those, flung upon the corpses of their husbands and their brothers, children upon the bodies of their aged fathers who gave them life, bewail from lips no longer free the death of their dearest ones, while these—",
        "92":"a night of restless toil after battle sets them down famished to break their fast on such fare as the town affords; not faring according to rank, but as each man has drawn his lot by chance.",
        "93":"And even now they are quartered in the captured Trojan homes, delivered from the frosts and dew of the naked sky, and like happy men will sleep all the night without a guard.\n Now if they keep clear of guilt towards the gods of the town—those of the conquered land—and towards their shrines,",
        "94":"the captors shall not be made captives in their turn. Only may no mad impulse first assail the army, overmastered by greed, to pillage what they should not! For to win safe passage home they need to travel back the other length of their double course.",
        "95":"But even if, without having offended the gods, our troops should reach home, the grievous suffering of the dead might still remain awake—if no fresh disaster transpires. These are my woman’s words; but may the good prevail clearly for all to see!",
        "96":"For, choosing thus, I have chosen the enjoyment of many a blessing.\n ",
        "97":"\n Lady, you speak as wisely as a prudent man. And, for my part, now that I have listened to your certain proofs, I prepare to address due prayers of thanksgiving to the gods; for a success has been achieved that well repays the toil.\n ",
        "98":"Hail, sovereign Zeus, and you kindly Night, you who have given us great glory, you who cast your meshed snare upon the towered walls of Troy , so that neither old nor young could overleap",
        "99":"the huge enslaving net of all-conquering Destruction. Great Zeus it is, lord of host and guest, whom I revere—he has brought this to pass. He long kept his bow bent against Alexander",
        "100":"until his bolt would neither fall short of the mark nor, flying beyond the stars, be launched in vain.\n ",
        "101":"\n The stroke of Zeus they may call it; his hand can be traced there. As he determines, so he acts. Someone said",
        "102":"that the gods do not trouble themselves to remember mortals who trample underfoot the grace of things not to be touched. But that man was impious!\n Now it stands revealed!",
        "103":"The penalty for reckless crime is ruin when men breathe a spirit of pride above just measure, because their mansions teem with more abundance than is good for them. But let there be such wealth as brings no distress, enough to satisfy",
        "104":"a sensible man. For riches do not protect the man who in wantonness has kicked the mighty altar of Justice into obscurity.\n ",
        "105":"Perverse Temptation, the overmastering child of designing Destruction, drives men on; and every remedy is futile. His evil is not hidden; it shines forth, a baleful gleam.",
        "106":"Like base metal beneath the touchstone’s rub, when tested he shows the blackness of his grain (for he is like a child who chases a winged bird)",
        "107":"and upon his people he brings a taint against which there is no defence. No god listens to his prayers. The man associated with such deeds, him they destroy in his unrighteousness.\n And such was Paris, who came",
        "108":"to the house of the sons of Atreus and dishonoured the hospitality of his host by stealing away a wedded wife.\n ",
        "109":"But she, bequeathing to her people the clang of shield and spear and army of fleets, and bringing to Ilium destruction in place of dowry, with light step she passed through the gates—daring a deed undareable. Then loud wailed the seers of the house crying,",
        "110":"Alas, alas, for the home, the home, and for the princes! Alas for the husband’s bed and the impress of her form so dear! He sits apart in the anguish of his grief, silent, dishonored but making no reproach. In his yearning for her who sped beyond the sea,",
        "111":"a phantom will seem to be lord of the house. The grace of fair-formed statues is hateful to him; and in the hunger of his eyes all loveliness is departed. \n ",
        "112":"Mournful apparitions come to him in dreams, bringing only vain joy; for vainly, whenever in his imagination a man sees delights,",
        "113":"straightaway the vision, slipping through his arms, is gone, winging its flight along the paths of sleep. Such are the sorrows at hearth and home, but here are sorrows surpassing these; and at large, in every house of all who went forth together from the land of Hellas ,",
        "114":"unbearable grief is seen. Many things pierce the heart. Each knows whom he sent forth. But to the home of each come",
        "115":"urns and ashes , not living men.\n ",
        "116":"\n Ares barters the bodies of men for gold; he holds his balance in the contest of the spear; and",
        "117":"back from Ilium to their loved ones he sends a heavy dust passed through his burning, a dust cried over with plenteous tears, in place of men sending well made urns with ashes.",
        "118":"So they lament, praising now this one: How skilled in battle! now that one: Fallen nobly in the carnage, — for another’s wife— some mutter in secret, and",
        "119":"grief charged with resentment spreads stealthily against the sons of Atreus, champions in the strife. But there far from home, around the\n city’s walls, those in their beauty’s bloom have graves in Ilium —",
        "120":"the enemy’s soil has covered its conquerors.\n ",
        "121":"\n Dangerous is a people’s voice charged with wrath—it acts as a curse of publicly ratified doom.",
        "122":"In anxious fear I wait to hear something shrouded still in gloom. The gods are not blind to men with blood upon their hands. In the end the black Spirits of Vengeance bring to obscurity that one who has prospered in unrighteousness and",
        "123":"wear down his fortunes by reverse. Once a man is among the unseen, there is no more help for him. Glory in excess is fraught with peril;",
        "124":"the lofty peak is struck by Zeus’ thunderbolt. I choose prosperity unassailed by envy. May I not be a sacker of cities, and may I not myself be despoiled and live to see my own life in another’s power!\n ",
        "125":"Heralded by a beacon of good tidings a swift report has spread throughout the town. Yet whether it is true, or some deception of the gods, who knows?\n ",
        "126":"\n Who is so childish or so bereft of sense,",
        "127":"once he has let his heart be fired by sudden news of a beacon fire, to despair if the story changes?\n ",
        "128":"\n It is just like a woman’s eager nature to yield assent to pleasing news before yet the truth is clear.\n ",
        "129":"Too credulous, a woman’s mind has boundaries open to quick encroachment; but quick to perish is rumor spread by a woman.\n ",
        "130":"\n We shall soon know about this passing on of flaming lights",
        "131":"and beacon signals and fires, whether they perhaps are true or whether, dream-like, this light’s glad coming has beguiled our senses. Look! I see approaching from the shore a herald crowned with boughs of olive.",
        "132":"The thirsty dust, consorting sister of the mud , assures me that neither by pantomime nor by kindling a flame of mountain wood will he signal with smoke of fire. Either in plain words he will bid us to rejoice the more, or—but I have little love for the report opposite to this!",
        "133":"May still further good be added to the good that has appeared!\n ",
        "134":"\n Whoever makes this prayer with other intent toward the state, let him reap himself the fruit of his misguided purpose!\n ",

        "136":"Many hopes have shattered, one only have I seen fulfilled; for I never dared to dream that here in this land of Argos I should die and have due portion of burial most dear to me. Now blessings on the land, blessings on the light of the sun, and blessed be Zeus, the land’s Most High, and the Pythian lord;",
        "137":"and may he launch no more his shafts against us. Enough of your hostility did you display by Scamander’s banks; but now, in other mood, be our preserver and our healer, O lord Apollo. And the gods gathered here, I greet them all; him, too, my own patron,",

And when all unwittingly my father had quickly taken servings that he did not recognize, he ate a meal which, as you see, has proved fatal to his race. Now, discovering his unhallowed deed, he uttered a great cry, reeled back, vomiting forth the slaughtered flesh, and invoked",
        "486":"an unbearable curse upon the line of Pelops, kicking the banquet table to aid his curse, thus perish all the race of Pleisthenes! This is the reason that you see this man fallen here. I am he who planned this murder and with justice. For together with my hapless father he drove me out,",
        "487":"me his third child, as yet a baby in swaddling-clothes. But grown to manhood, justice has brought me back again. Exile though I was, I laid my hand upon my enemy, compassing every device of cunning to his ruin.",
        "488":"So even death would be sweet to me now that I behold him in justice’s net.\n ",
        "489":"\n Aegisthus, excessive triumph amid distress I do not honor. You say that of your own intent you slew this man and did alone plot this pitiful murder.",
        "490":"I tell you in the hour of justice that you yourself, be sure of that, will not escape the people’s curses and death by stoning at their hand.\n ",
        "491":"\n You speak like that, you who sit at the lower oar when those upon the higher bench control the ship? Old as you are, you shall learn how bitter it is",
        "492":"at your age to be schooled when prudence is the lesson set before you. Bonds and the pangs of hunger are far the best doctors of the spirit when it comes to instructing the old. Do you have eyes and lack understanding? Do not kick against the goads lest you strike to your own hurt.\n ",
        "493":"Woman that you are! Skulking at home and awaiting the return of the men from war, all the while defiling a hero’s bed, did you contrive this death against a warrior chief?\n ",
        "494":"\n These words of yours likewise shall prove a source of tears. The tongue of Orpheus is quite the opposite of yours.",
        "495":"He led all things by the rapture of his voice; but you, who have stirred our wrath by your silly yelping, shall be led off yourself. You will appear tamer when put down by force.\n ",
        "496":"\n As if you would ever truly be my master here in Argos , you who did contrive our king’s death, and",
        "497":"then had not the courage to do this deed of murder with your own hand!\n ",
        "498":"\n Because to ensnare him was clearly the woman’s part; I was suspect as his enemy of old. However, with his gold I shall endeavor to control the people; and whoever is unruly,",
        "499":"him I’ll yoke with a heavy collar, and in truth he shall be no well-fed trace-horse! No! Loathsome hunger that houses with darkness shall see him gentle.\n ",
        "500":"\n Why then, in the baseness of your soul, did you not kill him yourself, but leave his slaying to a woman,",
        "501":"a plague to her country and her country’s gods? Oh, does Orestes perhaps still behold the light, that, with favoring fortune, he may come home and be the slayer of this pair with victory complete?\n ",
        "502":"\n Oh well, since you plan to act and speak like that, you shall be taught a lesson soon.",
        "503":"On guard, my trusty guardsmen, your work lies close to hand.\n ",
        "504":"\n On guard then! Let every one make ready his sword with hand on hilt.\n ",
        "505":"\n My hand too is laid on my sword hilt, and I do not shrink from death.\n ",
        "506":"\n Death for yourself, you say. We hail the omen. We welcome fortune’s test.\n ",
        "507":"\n No, my dearest, let us work no further ills. Even these are many to reap, a wretched harvest. Of woe we have enough; let us have no bloodshed. Venerable elders, go back to your homes, and yield in time to destiny before you come to harm. What we did had to be done. But should this trouble prove enough, we will accept it,",
        "508":"sorely battered as we are by the heavy hand of fate. Such is a woman’s counsel, if any care to learn from it.\n ",
        "509":"But to think that these men should let their wanton tongues thus blossom into speech against me and cast about such insults, putting their fortune to the test! To reject wise counsel and insult their master!\n ",
        "510":"\n \n It would not be like men of Argos to cringe before a man as low as you.\n ",
        "511":"Ha! I will visit you with vengeance yet in days to come.\n ",
        "512":"\n Not if fate shall guide Orestes to return home.\n ",
        "513":"\n From my own experience I know that exiles feed on hope.\n ",
        "514":"\n Keep on, grow fat, polluting justice, since you can.\n ",
        "515":"\n \n Know that you shall atone to me for your insolent folly.\n ",
        "516":"Brag in your bravery like a cock beside his hen.\n ",
        "517":"\n Do no care for their idle yelpings. I and you will be masters of this house and order it aright.\n ",
