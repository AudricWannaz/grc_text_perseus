        "0":"Men of Cadmus’s city, he who guards from the stern the concerns of the State and guides its helm with eyes untouched by sleep must speak to the point. For if we succeed, the responsibility is heaven’s;",
        "1":"but if—may it not happen—disaster is our lot, Eteocles would be the one name shouted many times throughout the city in the citizens’ resounding uproars and laments. From these evils may Zeus the Defender, upholding his name, shield the city of the Cadmeans!",
        "2":"But now you—both he who is still short of his youthful prime, and he who, though past his prime, still strengthens the abundant growth of his body, and every man still in his prime, as is fitting—you must aid the State and",
        "3":"the altars of your homeland’s gods so that their honors may never be obliterated. You must aid, too, your children, and Mother Earth, your beloved nurse. For welcoming all the distress of your childhood, when you were young and crept upon her kind soil, she raised you to inhabit her and bear the shield,",
        "4":"and to prove yourselves faithful in this time of need. And so, until today, God has been favorably inclined, for though we have long been under siege, the war has gone well for the most part through the gods’ will. But now, as the seer, the herdsman of birds, informs us,",
        "5":"using his ears and his mind to understand with unerring skill the prophetic birds unaided by sacrificial fire—he, master of such prophecy, declares that the greatest Argive attack is being planned in night assembly and that they will make plans to capture our city.",
        "6":"Hurry each of you to the battlements and the gates of our towered walls! Rush with all your armor! Fill the parapets and take your positions on the platforms of the towers. Stand your ground bravely where the gates open out,",
        "7":"and do not be afraid of this crowd of foreigners. God will bring it to a good end.\n I myself have dispatched scouts and men to observe their army, and I am confident that their going is not in vain. Once I have heard their report, I will not be taken by any trickery.\n ",
        "8":"Eteocles, mighty prince of the Cadmeans,",
        "9":"I have returned with a sure report of the army outside the walls; I myself am an eyewitness of their actions. Seven warriors, fierce regiment-commanders, slaughtered a bull over a black shield, and then touching the bull’s gore with their hands they swore an oath",
        "10":"by Ares, by Enyo, and by Rout who delights in blood, that either they will level the city and sack the Cadmeans’ town by force, or will in death smear this soil with their blood. And on Adrastus’ chariot they were placing remembrances of themselves",
        "11":"for their parents at home, and were shedding tears while so doing, but no piteous wailing escaped their lips. For their iron- hearted spirit heaved, blazing with courage, as of lions with war in their eyes. Your knowledge of these things was not delayed by fearfulness;",
        "12":"for I left them casting lots to decide how each commander, his post assigned by chance, would lead his regiment against the gates. Therefore, choose the bravest men of the city and station them quickly at the outlets of the gates. For nearby already the Argive army in full armor \n",
        "13":"is advancing in a flurry of dust, and glistening foam splatters the plain in drops from the horses’ pantings. So you, like the careful helmsman of a ship, secure the city before Ares’ blasts storm down upon it; for the wave of their army now crashes over the dry land.",
        "14":"Seize the first opportune moment for doing this. For all else, I, on my part, will keep a reliable eye on the lookout, and you, by learning from my certain report what happens beyond the gates, shall remain unharmed. Exit. \n \n ",
        "15":"O Zeus and Earth, and gods that guard our city,",
        "16":"and Curse, potent agent of my father’s vengeance, do not destroy my city, ripping it up from its foundations, captive of the enemy, a city that speaks in Greece ’s tongue, and do not destroy our hearths and homes.",
        "17":"May they never hold the free land and city of Cadmus beneath the yoke of slavery! Be our protection! I am certain that what I ask is in our common interest; for a State that prospers pays honors to its gods. Exit Eteocles, with citizens. The Chorus enters in fearful agitation. \n \n ",
        "18":"In terror I wail loud cries of sorrow. Their army is let loose! Leaving camp,",
        "19":"—look!—the mounted throng floods swiftly ahead. The dust whirling in the air tells me this is so—its message is speechless, yet clear and true.\n And now the plains of my native land under the blows of hooves send a roar to my ears; the sound flies",
        "20":"and rumbles like a resistless torrent crashing down a mountainside.\n Ah, ah, you gods and goddesses, raise your war cry over our walls to drive away the onrushing evil!\n The army of the white shield,",
        "21":"ready for battle, rushes at full speed against the city.\n Who then will rescue us, which of the gods or goddesses will help?\n Or shall I fall in supplication at the feet",
        "22":"of our ancestral gods’ statues?\n Ah, blessed gods, firmly enthroned, the time has come to hold fast to your statues. Why do we delay, who are much to be lamented?",
        "23":"Do you hear the clash of shields, or does it escape you? When, if not now, shall we place sacred robes and wreaths on the statues to accompany our prayers?\n I see the clash—it is not the clatter of a single spear. What will you do? Will you betray",
        "24":"your own land, Ares, where you have dwelt since long ago? God of the golden helmet, look, look upon the city that you once cherished!\n ",
        "25":"Oh come all you gods who guard our city and its land!",
        "26":"See this suppliant band of maidens praying to be saved from slavery. A torrent of men, their helmet plumes tossing, crashes around the city,",
        "27":"sped on by the blasts of Ares. No! Father Zeus, all-accomplishing, fend from us altogether capture at the hands of the enemy.\n \n ",
        "28":"The Argives encircle the citadel of Cadmus. Terror of their weapons of war shakes us, as the bridles in the horse’s jaws rattle the sound of death. Seven bold captains, conspicuous among the army",
        "29":"in spear-wielding harnesses, at the seven gates take their stand each according to his lot.\n ",
        "30":"Pallas, Zeus-born power delighting in battle, prove yourself the savior of the city!",
        "31":"And you, lord of steeds, ruler of the deep, Poseidon, with your fish-striking weapon grant us release from our fears, grant us release!\n \n ",
        "32":"You too, Ares—pity us!—guard the city named for Cadmus and make evident your closeness to us!",
        "33":"And Cypris, you who are the first mother of our race, defend us who are sprung from your blood. We come to you, crying out in prayers for your divine ears.\n \n ",
        "34":"And you, Apollo, lord of the Wolf, be a wolf to the enemy force and give them groan for groan!\n You too, maiden child of Leto, ready your bow!\n ",
        "35":"Ah! Ah!",
        "36":"I hear the rattle of chariots encircling the town. O lady Hera! The hubs are creaking beneath the axles’ load. Beloved Artemis!",
        "37":"The air rages at the shaking of spears! What is happening to our city? What will the future bring? And where does God finally lead us?\n ",
        "38":"Ah! Ah! A hail of stones strikes our battlements from afar. O beloved Apollo!",
        "39":"There is the clang of bronze-bound shields at the gates. O son of Zeus, in whom dwells the sacred power to decide in battle war’s outcome! And you, blessed queen Onca, on behalf of the city,",
        "40":"defend your seven- gated home!\n ",
        "41":"All-powerful divinities, you gods and goddesses who wield the power to guard the towers of our land, do not betray our city that now toils under the spear",
        "42":"to an alien-tongued army. Hear us, hear, as is right, the prayers we maidens offer with outstretched hands.\n ",
        "43":"Beloved spirits,",
        "44":"encompass the city to deliver it from ruin and show that you love it. Consider the people’s offerings, and as you consider, help us.",
        "45":"Remember, I beg, our city’s worship, rich in sacrifice..\n ",
        "46":"You intolerable things! I ask you, is this the best way to save the city? Does it hearten our army here besieged,",
        "47":"when you fall before the images of the gods that guard the city and shout and shriek—behavior that moderate people despise? May I never share my home with the female race, neither in time of evil nor in pleasant prosperity! When things go well for her, her boldness is unbearable,",
        "48":"but when she is afraid, she is an even greater evil for home and city. So now your cries as you rushed here and there in panicked flight have rattled the citizens into dispirited cowardice. The cause of the enemy outside our gates is excellently strengthened by your behavior, while we inside are ruined by our own people.",
        "49":"This is the sort of trouble you will have if you dwell with women. Now if anyone fails to obey my authority—whether man or woman or something in between—a sentence of death will be decreed for him and by no means whatsoever will he escape destruction by stoning at the people’s hands.",
        "50":"It is for the man to take care of business outside the house; let no woman make decrees in those matters. Keep inside and do no harm! Do you hear me or not? Am I speaking to the deaf?\n ",
        "51":"Dear son of Oedipus, I grew afraid when I heard the clatter of the crashing chariots,",
        "52":"when the hubs screamed as they whirled around the wheel, and when I heard the sound of the steering gear, fire-forged bits, in the horses’ mouths.\n ",
        "53":"Well, then, has a helmsman ever found a way to safety by fleeing from stern to prow,",
        "54":"when his ship is foundering in high seas?\n ",
        "55":"But trusting in the gods I came in haste to their ancient statues, when the deadly blizzard of falling stones thundered against the gates. Just then I set out in fear to pray to the Blessed Ones",
        "56":"that they spread their protection over the city.\n ",
        "57":"Pray that the rampart withstand the enemy spear. Yes, the outcome is in the gods’ hands—but then, it is said that the gods of a captured city abandon it.\n ",
        "58":"Never so long as I live may this divine assembly abandon us,",
        "59":"nor may I live to see the city overrun and the army seizing it with hostile fire!\n ",
        "60":"When you invoke the gods, do not be ill-advised. For Obedience is",
        "61":"the mother of Success, wife of Salvation—as the saying goes.\n ",
        "62":"So she is, but the power of god is supreme, and often in bad times it raises the helpless man out of harsh misery even when stormclouds are lowering over his eyes.\n ",
        "63":"It is the man’s duty to offer victims and sacrifices to the gods when they test their enemy; your duty is to be silent and to remain inside the house.\n ",
        "64":"By the will of the gods we inhabit an unconquered city, and the rampart withstands the enemy throng.",
        "65":"What indignation makes you resent this?\n ",
        "66":"I do not begrudge your honor of the divine race; but lest you make the citizens cowardly, be calm and do not be overly fearful.\n ",
        "67":"When I heard the strange and jumbled clashes,",
        "68":"I came in trembling fear to this citadel, our seat of worship.\n ",
        "69":"If, then, you hear that men are dying or wounded, do not seize on the news with loud wailing. For this is the food of Ares, human blood.\n ",
        "70":"Oh, but I hear horses snorting!\n ",
        "71":"Hear them, then, but not too clearly.\n ",
        "72":"The city groans from deep in the earth, as though we are surrounded.\n ",
        "73":"Surely it is enough that I am making plans for this?\n ",
        "74":"I am terrified—the crashing at the gates is increasing.\n ",
        "75":"Won’t you be silent, and speak none of this throughout the city?\n ",
        "76":"Divine company, do not betray our fortifications!\n ",
        "77":"Damn you! Will you not endure these events in silence?\n ",
        "78":"Gods of our city! Do not let my fate be slavery!\n ",
        "79":"You would enslave both me and all the city.\n ",
        "80":"Almighty Zeus, turn your missile against the enemy!\n ",
        "81":"O Zeus, what a breed you have made for us in women!\n ",
        "82":"A breed steeped in misery, just like men whose city is captured.\n ",
        "83":"Why are your words ill-omened, when you still grasp the gods’ statues?\n ",
        "84":"In my weakness fear controls my tongue.\n ",
        "85":"If only you would grant my plea for a small service.\n ",
        "86":"Please state it as quickly as possible, and I will quickly know what to do.\n ",
        "87":"Be silent, wretched woman; do not terrify your own men.\n ",
        "88":"I am silent. I will suffer what is destined together with the others.\n ",
        "89":"I welcome this sentiment of yours over what you said before.",
        "90":"And in addition, keep your distance from the gods’ images and make a stronger prayer, that the gods fight on our side. And once you have heard my prayers, then sing the victory song, the sacred cry of joy and goodwill, our Greek ritual of shouting in tribute,",
        "91":"that brings courage to our friends and dissolves fear of the enemy.\n And now Here Eteocles makes his vow. to the gods who guard our city’s land, both those who dwell in the plain and those who watch over its meeting-place, to Dirce’s springs and the waters of Ismenus, I vow that, if things go well and the city is saved,",
        "92":"the citizens shall redden the gods’ altars with the blood of sheep and sacrifice bulls to the gods—this is my vow—and offer trophies, while I will crown their holy temples with the spoil of the enemy’s spear-pierced garments.\n \n ",
        "93":"Make this kind of prayer to the gods, without your previous lamentation, nor with wild and useless panting; for you will not escape your destiny any the more. As for me, I will go station six men, with me as the seventh, as champions to oppose the enemy in proud fashion",
        "94":"at the seven exits in the wall, even before speedy messengers or swift-rushing reports arrive and inflame us with urgent need. Exit. \n \n ",
        "95":"I heed him, but through terror my heart finds no repose.",
        "96":"Anxieties border upon my heart and kindle my fear of the army surrounding our walls, as a trembling dove fears for her children in the nest because of snakes that are dangerous bed-fellows.",
        "97":"For against our fortifications some are advancing with all their men, all in formation. Ah, what will become of me? Others are hurling jagged boulders",
        "98":"at the citizens on all sides. O Gods born of Zeus, by every means rescue our city and people, sprung from Cadmus!\n ",
        "99":"What more fertile plain will you find in place of ours,",
        "100":"if you abandon to the enemy this deep-soiled land and the water of Dirce which is the most nourishing of the streams that earth-encircling Poseidon",
        "101":"and Tethys’ children pour forth? Therefore, divine guardians of the city, hurl murderous destruction on the men outside our walls",
        "102":"and panic that makes them throw away their weapons, and so win glory for these citizens. Defend the city and remain in possession of your home and throne",
        "103":"in answer to our shrill, wailing prayers!\n ",
        "104":"It is a great cause for grief to hurl a primeval city to Hades in this way, quarry and slave of the spear, ravaged shamefully in the dusty ashes by an Argive man through divine will.",
        "105":"And grief, too, to let the women be led away captive—ah me!—young and old, dragged by the hair, like horses, with their cloaks torn off them.",
        "106":"A city, emptied, shouts out as the human booty perishes with mingled cries. A heavy fate, indeed, my fear anticipates.\n ",
        "107":"It is a lamentable thing that modest girls should be plucked unripe, before the customary rites, and should make",
        "108":"a loathsome journey from their homes. What? I declare that the dead will do better than the captives; for when a city is subdued—ah, ah!—many and miserable are its sufferings.",
        "109":"Man drags off man, or kills, or sets fires; the whole city is defiled with smoke. Mad Ares storms, subduing the people and polluting reverence.\n ",
        "110":"Tumults swell through the town, and against it a towering net is advancing. Man falls before man beneath the spear. Sobs and wails over gore-covered babes, just nursed at their mothers’ breasts,",
        "111":"resound. Rape and pillage of those fleeing through the city are the deeds of one’s own blood. Plunderer joins up with plunderer; the empty-handed calls to the empty-handed, wishing to have a partner,",
        "112":"each greedy for neither less nor equal share. Reason exists for imagining what will come after this.\n ",
        "113":"The earth’s varied fruits, fallen to the ground, give pain, a bitter sight for the maid-servants.",
        "114":"In jumbled confusion the abundant gifts of earth are carried away by reckless looting waves. Young women, enslaved, suffer a new evil: a bed of misery, prize of the conquering enemy’s spear, as though of a prospering husband—",
        "115":"they can expect the coming of the nightly rite, which gives aid to tears and anguish! \n \n ",
        "116":"The scout, I believe,",
        "117":"is bringing some fresh news of the army to us, my friends, since the joints of his legs are hastily speeding as they carry him on his mission.\n ",
        "118":"And, indeed, here is our lord himself, the son of Oedipus, at the right moment to hear the messenger’s report. Haste makes his stride uneven, too.\n ",
        "119":"It is with certain knowledge that I will give my account of the enemy’s actions, how each man according to lot has been posted at the gates. Tydeus is already storming opposite the Proetid gates; but the seer will not allow him to ford the Ismenus because the omens from the sacrifices are not favorable.",
        "120":"Yet Tydeus, raging and eager for battle, shouts like a serpent hissing at high noon, and lashes skilled Oecles’ son, with the taunt that he cringes in cowardice before death and battle. With such cries he shakes three overshadowing plumes,",
        "121":"his helmet’s mane, while from under his shield, bells forged of bronze therein ring out a fearsome clang. He has this haughty symbol on his shield: a well-crafted sky, ablaze with stars, and the brightness of the full moon shining in the center of the shield,",
        "122":"the moon that is the most revered of the stars, the eye of night. Raving so in his arrogant armor, he shouts beside the river-bank, craving battle, like some charger that fiercely champs at the bit as he waits in eagerness for the trumpet’s war-cry.",
        "123":"Whom will you send against him? Who will be capable of standing as our champion at the Proetid gate when its bars are loosened?\n ",
        "124":"I would not tremble before any mere ornaments on a man. Nor can signs and symbols wound and kill—crests and bell have no bite without the spear.",
        "125":"And regarding this \"night\" which you describe on his shield, sparkling with heaven’s stars—perhaps the folly of it might yield to one some prophetic understanding. For should night fall on this man’s eyes as he dies, then to its bearer this arrogant symbol",
        "126":"would prove rightly and justly named; and it is against himself that he will have prophesied this outrageous violence. Now as for me, against Tydeus I will station the trusty son of Astacus as defender of this gate, since he is full noble and",
        "127":"reveres the throne of Honor and detests proud speech. He is slow to act disgracefully, and he has no cowardly nature. His race springs from the men sown of the dragon’s teeth, from one of those whom Ares spared, and so Melanippus is truly born of our land. Ares will decide the outcome with a throw of the dice;",
        "128":"but Justice, his kin by blood, indeed sends this man forth to keep the enemy spear from the mother that gave him birth. Exit Melanippus. \n \n ",
        "129":"May the gods grant success to our champion, since he rises up in a just cause, to battle for his city! But I shudder",
        "130":"to watch the bloody deaths of men cut down for the sake of their own people.\n ",
        "131":"Yes, may the gods so grant success to this man. Capaneus is stationed at the Electran gates, another giant of a man, greater than the one described before.",
        "132":"But his boast is too proud for a mere human, and he makes terrifying threats against our battlements—which, I hope, chance will not fulfil! For he says he will utterly destroy the city with god’s will or without it, and that not even conflict with Zeus, though it should fall before him in the plain, will stand in his way.",
        "133":"The god’s lightning and thunderbolts he compares to midday heat. For his shield’s symbol he has a man without armor bearing fire, and the torch, his weapon, blazes in his hands; and in golden letters he says I will burn the city.",
        "134":"Against such a man make your dispatch—who will meet him in combat, who will stand firm without trembling before his boasts?\n ",
        "135":"Here too gain follows with interest from gain. The tongue proves in the end to be an unerring accuser of men’s wicked thoughts.",
        "136":"Capaneus makes his threats, ready to act, irreverent toward the gods, and giving his tongue full exercise in wicked glee, he, though a mere mortal, sends a loud and swollen boast to Zeus in heaven. But I trust that the fire-bearing thunderbolt will justly come to him,",
        "137":"and when it comes it will not be anything like the sun’s mid-day heat. And against him, even though he is a big talker, a man of fiery spirit, mighty Polyphontes, is stationed, a dependable sentinel",
        "138":"with the good will of guardian Artemis and the other gods. Now tell me about another one allotted to other gates! Exit Polyphontes. \n \n ",
        "139":"Death to him who exults so arrogantly over the city! May the thunderbolt stop him before he leaps into my home",
        "140":"and plunders me from my maiden chambers with his outrageous spear!\n ",
        "141":"Now I will tell you about the man who next drew station at the gates. The third lot leaped out of the upturned bronze helmet for Eteoclus,",
        "142":"to hurl his band against the Neistan gates. He whirls his horses as they snort through their bridles, eager to fall against the gate. Their muzzles whistle in a barbarian way, filled with the breath of their haughty nostrils.",
        "143":"His shield is decorated in great style: an armored man climbs a ladder’s rungs to mount an enemy tower that he wants to destroy. This one, too, shouts in syllables of written letters that even Ares could not hurl him from the battlements.",
        "144":"Send a dependable opponent against this man, too, to keep the yoke of slavery from our city.\n ",
        "145":"I would send this man here, and with good fortune. Exit Megareus. Indeed, he has already been sent, his only boast in his hands, Megareus, Creon’s seed, of the race of the sown- men.",
        "146":"He will not withdraw from the gate in fear of the thunder of the horses’ furious snorting; but either he will die and pay the earth the full price of his nurture, or will capture two men and the city on the shield, and then adorn his father’s house with the spoils.",
        "147":"Tell me about another’s boasts and do not begrudge me the full tale!\n ",
        "148":"O champion of my home, I pray that this man will have good fortune, and that there will be bad fortune for his enemies. As they boast too much against the city in their frenzied mind,",
        "149":"so, too, may Zeus the Requiter look on them in anger!\n ",
        "150":"Another, the fourth, has the gate near Onca Athena and takes his stand with a shout, Hippomedon, tremendous in form and figure. I shuddered in fear as he spun a huge disk—the circle of his shield, I mean—",
        "151":"I cannot deny it. The symbol-maker who put the design on his shield was no lowly craftsman: the symbol is Typhon, spitting out of his fire-breathing mouth a dark, thick smoke, the darting sister of fire.",
        "152":"And the rim of the hollow-bellied shield is fastened all around with snaky braids. The warrior himself has raised the war-cry and, inspired by Ares he raves for battle like a maenad, with a look to inspire fear. We must put up a good defense against the assault of such a man,",
        "153":"for already Rout is boasting of victory at the gate.\n ",
        "154":"First Onca Pallas, who dwells near the city, close by the gate, and who loathes outrageousness in a man, will fend him off like a dangerous snake away from nestlings. Moreover, Hyperbius, Oenops’ trusty son,",
        "155":"is chosen to match him, man to man, as he is eager to search out his fate in the crisis that chance has wrought—neither in form, nor spirit nor in the wielding of his arms does he bear reproach. Hermes has appropriately pitted them against each other. For the man is hostile to the man he faces in battle,",
        "156":"and the gods on their shields also meet as enemies. The one has fire-breathing Typhon, while father Zeus stands upright on Hyperbius’ shield, his lightening bolt aflame in his hand. And no one yet has seen Zeus conquered.",
        "157":"Such then is the favor of the divine powers: we are with the victors, they with the vanquished, if Zeus in fact proves stronger in battle than Typhon. And it is likely that the mortal adversaries will fare as do their gods; and so, in accordance with the symbol,",
        "158":"Zeus will be a savior for Hyperbius since he resides on his shield. Exit Hyperbius. \n \n ",
        "159":"I am sure that Zeus’ antagonist, since he has on his shield the unloved form of an earth-born deity, an image hated by both mortals and the long-lived gods,",
        "160":"will drop his head in death before the gate.\n ",
        "161":"Let it be so! Next I describe the fifth man who is stationed at the fifth, the Northern gate opposite the tomb of Amphion, Zeus’s son. He swears by his spear which, in his confidence, he holds more to be revered than a god",
        "162":"and more precious than his eyes, that he will sack the city of the Cadmeans in spite of Zeus. He says this, the beautiful child of a mountain-bred mother—a warrior, half man, half boy, and his beard’s first growth is just now advancing on his cheeks,",
        "163":" his youth in first bloom, thick, upspringing hair. But now he makes his advance with a savage heart and a terrifying look, not at all like the maidens he’s named for. Nor does he take his stand at the gate unboasting, but wields our city’s shame on his bronze-forged",
