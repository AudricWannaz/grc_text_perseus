                "0":"\n \n Darius and Parysatis had two sons\n born to them, of whom the elder was Artaxerxes and the younger\n Cyrus . Now when\n Darius lay sick and suspected that the end of his life was near, he\n wished to have both his sons with him. \n ",
                "1":"\n The elder, as it chanced, was with him already; but\n Cyrus he summoned from the province over\n which he had made him satrap, and he had also appointed him\n commander of all the forces that muster in the plain of\n Castolus. \n Cyrus accordingly went up to his father,\n taking with him Tissaphernes as a friend and accompanied by three\n hundred Greek hoplites, under the command of Xenias of Parrhasia . \n ",
                "2":"\n When Darius had died and Artaxerxes\n had become established as king, Tissaphernes falsely accused\n Cyrus to his brother of plotting against\n him. And Artaxerxes, believing the accusation, arrested\n Cyrus , with the intention of putting him to\n death; his mother, however, made intercession for him, and sent him\n back again to his province. \n ",
                "3":"\n Now when Cyrus had thus returned, after his\n danger and disgrace, he set about planning that he might never again\n be in the power of his brother, but, if possible, might be king in\n his stead. He had, in the first place, the support of Parysatis, his\n mother, for she loved him better than the son who was king,\n Artaxerxes. \n ",
                "4":"\n Again, when any of the King’s court came to visit him, he treated\n them all in such a way that when he sent them back they were more\n devoted to him than to the King. He also took care that the\n barbarians of his own province\n should be capable soldiers and should feel kindly toward him. \n ",
                "5":"\n Lastly, as regards his Greek force, he proceeded to collect it with\n the utmost secrecy, so that he might take the King as completely\n unprepared as possible. It was in the\n following way, then, that he gathered this force: In the first\n place, he sent orders to the commanders of all the garrisons he had\n in the cities to enlist as many Peloponnesian soldiers of the best\n sort as they severally could, on the plea that Tissaphernes had\n designs upon their cities. For, in fact, the Ionian cities had\n originally belonged to Tissaphernes, by gift of the King, but at\n that time all of them except Miletus had revolted and gone over to\n Cyrus . \n ",
                "6":"\n The people of Miletus \n also were planning to do the very same thing, namely, to go over to\n Cyrus , but Tissaphernes, finding out about\n it in time, put some of them to death and banished others.\n Cyrus thereupon took the exiles under his\n protection, collected an army, and laid siege to Miletus both by land and by\n sea, and endeavoured to restore the exiles to their city; and this,\n again, made him another pretext for gathering an army. \n ",
                "7":"\n Meanwhile he sent to the King and urged, on the ground that he was\n his brother, that these Ionian cities should be given to him instead\n of remaining under the rule of Tissaphernes, and his mother\n co-operated with him in this. The result was that the King failed to\n perceive the plot against himself, but believed that\n Cyrus was spending money on his troops\n because he was at war with Tissaphernes. Consequently he was not at\n all displeased at their being at war, the less so because\n Cyrus regularly remitted to the King the\n tribute which came in from the cities he chanced to have that\n belonged to Tissaphernes. \n ",
                "8":"\n Still another army was being collected\n for him in the Chersonese \n which is opposite Abydus , in the following manner: Clearchus \n was a Lacedaemonian exile; Cyrus , making his\n acquaintance, came to admire him, and gave him ten thousand\n darics. And\n Clearchus, taking the gold, collected an army by means of this\n money, and using the Chersonese as a base of operations, proceeded to\n make war upon the Thracians who dwell beyond the Hellespont , thereby aiding the\n Greeks. Consequently,\n the Hellespontine cities of their own free will sent Clearchus\n contributions of money for the support of his troops. So it was that\n this army also was being secretly maintained for\n Cyrus . \n ",
                "9":"\n Again, Aristippus the Thessalian\n chanced to be a friend of Cyrus , and since he\n was hard pressed by his political opponents at home, he came to\n Cyrus and asked him for three months’ pay\n for two thousand mercenaries, urging that in this way he should get\n the better of his opponents. And Cyrus gave him\n six months’ pay for four thousand, and requested him not to come to\n terms with his opponents until he had consulted with him. Thus the\n army in Thessaly , again,\n was being secretly maintained for him. \n ",
                "10":"\n Furthermore,\n Cyrus directed Proxenus the Boeotian, who\n was a friend of his, to come to him with as many men as he could\n get, saying that he wished to undertake a campaign against the\n Pisidians, because, as he said, they were causing trouble to his\n province. He also directed Sophaenetus the Stymphalian and Socrates\n the Achaean, who were likewise friends of his, to come with as many\n men as they could get, saying that he intended to make war upon\n Tissaphernes with the aid of the Milesian exiles; and they proceeded\n to carry out his directions. \n "

                "0":"\n When he thought the time had come to\n begin his upward march, the pretext he offered was that he\n wished to drive the Pisidians out of his land entirely, and it was\n avowedly against them that he set about collecting both his\n barbarian and his Greek troops. At that time he also sent word to\n Clearchus to come to him with the entire army which he had, and to\n Aristippus to effect a reconciliation with his adversaries at home\n and send him the army which he had; and he sent word to Xenias the\n Arcadian, who commanded for him the mercenary force in the\n cities, to come\n with his troops, leaving behind only so many as were necessary to\n garrison the citadels. \n ",
                "1":"\n He likewise summoned the troops which were besieging Miletus , and urged the\n Milesian exiles to take the field with him, promising them that, if\n he should successfully accomplish the object for which he was taking\n the field, he would not stop until he had restored them to their\n homes. And they gladly obeyed—for they trusted him—and presented\n themselves, under arms, at Sardis . \n ",
                "2":"\n Xenias, then, arrived at Sardis with the troops from the\n cities, who were hoplites to the number of four thousand; Proxenus\n was there with hoplites to the number of fifteen hundred, and five\n hundred light-armed troops; Sophaenetus the Stymphalian with a\n thousand hoplites; Socrates the Achaean with about five hundred\n hoplites; and Pasion the Megarian arrived with three hundred\n hoplites and three hundred peltasts. The\n last-named, and Socrates also, belonged to the force that had been\n engaged in besieging Miletus . All these came to\n Cyrus at Sardis . \n ",
                "3":"\n Meanwhile Tissaphernes had taken note\n of these proceedings and come to the conclusion that\n Cyru s’ preparations were too extensive to\n be against the Pisidians; he accordingly made his way to the King as\n quickly as he could, with about five hundred horsemen. \n ",
                "4":"\n And when the King heard from Tissaphernes about\n Cyru s’ array, he set about making\n counter-preparations. Cyrus was now setting forth from\n Sardis with the\n troops I have mentioned; and he marched through Lydia three stages, a distance of twenty-two parasangs, to the Maeander river. The width of this river was two\n plethra, and there was a bridge over it made of\n seven boats. \n ",
                "5":"\n After crossing the Maeander he marched through Phrygia one stage, a distance of\n eight parasangs, to Colossae , an inhabited city,\n prosperous and large. There he remained seven days; and Menon the Thessalian arrived, with a thousand\n hoplites and five hundred peltasts, consisting of Dolopians,\n Aenianians, and Olynthians. \n ",
                "6":"\n Thence he marched three stages, twenty parasangs, to Celaenae, an\n inhabited city of Phrygia ,\n large and prosperous. There Cyrus had a palace\n and a large park full of wild animals, which he used to hunt on\n horseback whenever he wished to give himself and his horses\n exercise. Through the middle of this park flows the Maeander river;\n its sources are beneath the palace, and it flows through the city of\n Celaenae also. \n ",
                "7":"\n There is likewise a palace of the Great King in\n Celaenae, strongly fortified and situated at the foot of the\n Acropolis over the sources of the Marsyas river; the Marsyas also\n flows through the city, and empties into the Maeander , and its width is\n twenty-five feet. It was here, according to the story, that Apollo\n flayed Marsyas, after having defeated him in a\n contest of musical skill; he hung up his skin in the cave from which\n the sources issue, and it is for this reason that the river is\n called Marsyas. \n ",
                "8":"\n It was here also, report has it, that Xerxes, when he was on his\n retreat from Greece after\n losing the famous battle, built the palace just mentioned and likewise the\n citadel of Celaenae. Here Cyrus remained thirty\n days; and Clearchus, the Lacedaemonian exile, arrived, with a\n thousand hoplites, eight hundred Thracian peltasts, and two hundred\n Cretan bowmen. At the same time came also Sosis the Syracusan with\n three hundred hoplites and Agias the Arcadian with a thousand\n hoplites. And here Cyrus held a review and made\n an enumeration of the Greeks in the park, and they amounted all told\n to eleven thousand hoplites and about two thousand peltasts. \n ",
                "9":"\n Thence he marched two stages, ten\n parasangs, to Peltae, an inhabited city. There he remained three\n days, during which time Xenias the Arcadian celebrated the\n Lycaean festival with sacrifice and\n held games; the prizes were golden strigils, and\n Cyrus himself was one of those who watched\n the games. Thence he marched two stages, twelve parasangs, to the\n inhabited city of Ceramon-agora, the last Phrygian city as one goes toward\n Mysia . \n ",
                "10":"\n Thence he marched three stages, thirty parasangs, to\n Caystru-pedion, an inhabited city. There he remained five\n days. At this time he was owing the soldiers more than three months’\n pay, and they went again and again to his headquarters and demanded\n what was due them. He all the while expressed hopes, and was\n manifestly troubled; for it was not Cyru s’ way\n to withhold payment when he had money. \n ",
                "11":"\n At this juncture arrived Epyaxa, the wife of Syennesis, the king of the Cilicians, coming to visit\n Cyrus , and the story was that she gave him\n a large sum of money; at any rate, Cyrus paid\n the troops at that time four months’ wages. The Cilician queen was\n attended by a body-guard of Cilicians and Aspendians; and people\n said that Cyrus had intimate relations with the\n queen. \n ",
                "12":"\n Thence he marched two stages, ten\n parasangs, to the inhabited city of Thymbrium. There, alongside the\n road, was the so-called spring of Midas, the king of the Phrygians,\n at which Midas, according to the story, caught the satyr by mixing\n wine with the water of the spring. \n ",
                "13":"\n Thence he marched two stages, ten parasangs, to Tyriaeum, an\n inhabited city. There he remained three days. And the Cilician\n queen, as the report ran, asked Cyrus to\n exhibit his army to her; such an exhibition was what he desired to\n make, and accordingly he held a review of the Greeks and the\n barbarians on the plain. \n ",
                "14":"\n He ordered the Greeks to form their lines and take their positions\n just as they were accustomed to do for battle, each general\n marshalling his own men. So they formed the line four deep, Menon\n and his troops occupying the right wing, Clearchus and his troops\n the left, and the other generals the centre. \n ",
                "15":"\n Cyrus inspected the barbarians first, and they\n marched past with their cavalry formed in troops and their infantry\n in companies; then he inspected the Greeks, driving past them in a\n chariot, the Cilician queen in a carriage. And the Greeks all had\n helmets of bronze, crimson tunics, and greaves, and carried their\n shields uncovered. \n ",
                "16":"\n When he had driven past them all, he halted his chariot in front of\n the centre of the phalanx, and sending his interpreter Pigres to the\n generals of the Greeks, gave orders that the troops should advance\n arms and the phalanx move forward in a body. The generals\n transmitted these orders to the soldiers, and when the trumpet\n sounded, they advanced arms and charged. And then, as they went on\n faster and faster, at length with a shout the troops broke into a\n run of their own accord, in the direction of the camp. \n ",
                "17":"\n As for the barbarians, they were terribly frightened; the Cilician\n queen took to flight in her carriage, and the people in the\n market left their wares behind and took\n to their heels; while the Greeks with a roar of laughter came up to\n their camp. Now the Cilician queen was filled with admiration at\n beholding the brilliant appearance and the order of the Greek army;\n and Cyrus was delighted to see the terror with\n which the Greeks inspired the barbarians. \n ",
                "18":"\n Thence he marched three stages, twenty\n parasangs, to Iconium , the\n last city of Phrygia . There\n he remained three days. Thence he marched through Lycaonia five stages, thirty\n parasangs. This country he gave over to the Greeks to plunder, on\n the ground that it was hostile territory. \n ",
                "19":"\n From there Cyrus sent the Cilician queen back to\n Cilicia by the shortest\n route, and he sent some of Menon’s troops to escort her, Menon\n himself commanding them. With the rest of the army\n Cyrus marched through Cappadocia four stages,\n twenty-five parasangs, to Dana , an inhabited city, large and prosperous.\n There they remained three days; and during that time\n Cyrus put to death a Persian named\n Megaphernes, who was a wearer of the royal purple, and another dignitary among his subordinates, on\n the charge that they were plotting against him. \n ",
                "20":"\n From there they made ready to try to\n enter Cilicia . Now the\n entrance was by a wagon-road, exceedingly steep and impracticable\n for an army to pass if there was anybody to oppose it; and in fact,\n as report ran, Syennesis was upon the heights, guarding the\n entrance; therefore Cyrus remained for a day in\n the plain. On the following day, however, a messenger came with word\n that Syennesis had abandoned the heights, because he had learned\n that Menon’s army was already in Cilicia , on his own side of the mountains, and\n because, further, he was getting reports that triremes belonging to\n the Lacedaemonians and\n to Cyrus himself were sailing around from\n Ionia to Cilicia under the command of\n Tamos. \n ",
                "21":"\n At any rate \n Cyrus climbed the mountains without meeting any\n opposition, and saw the camp where the Cilicians had been keeping\n guard. Thence he descended to a large and beautiful plain,\n well-watered and full of trees of all sorts and vines; it produces\n an abundance of sesame, millet, panic, wheat, and barley, and it is\n surrounded on every side, from sea to sea, by a lofty and formidable\n range of mountains. \n ",
                "22":"\n After descending he marched through this plain four stages,\n twenty-five parasangs, to Tarsus , a large and prosperous\n city of Cilicia , where the\n palace of Syennesis, the king of the Cilicians, was situated; and\n through the middle of the city flows a river named the Cydnus, two\n plethra in width. \n ",
                "23":"\n The inhabitants of this city had abandoned it and fled, with\n Syennesis, to a stronghold upon the mountains—all of them, at least,\n except the tavern-keepers; and there remained also those who dwelt\n on the sea-coast, in Soli \n and Issus . \n ",
                "24":"\n Now Epyaxa, the wife of Syennesis, had\n reached Tarsus five days\n ahead of Cyrus , but in the course of her\n passage over the mountains to the plain two companies of Menon’s\n army had\n been lost. Some said that they had been cut to pieces by the\n Cilicians while engaged in a bit of plundering; another story was\n that they had been left behind, and, unable to find the rest of the\n army or the roads, had thus wandered about and perished; at any\n rate, they numbered a hundred hoplites. \n ",
                "25":"\n And when the rest of Menon’s troops reached Tarsus , in their anger over the\n loss of their comrades they plundered thoroughly, not only the city,\n but also the palace that was in it. As for\n Cyrus , after he had marched into the city\n he more than once summoned Syennesis to his presence; but Syennesis\n said that he had never yet put himself in the hands of anyone who\n was more powerful than he was, and he would not now put himself in\n the hands of Cyrus until his wife had won him\n over and he had received pledges. \n ",
                "26":"\n When the two men finally met one another, Syennesis gave\n Cyrus a large sum of money for his army,\n while Cyrus gave him gifts which are regarded\n at court as tokens of\n honour—a horse with a gold-mounted bridle, a gold necklace and\n bracelets, a gold dagger and a Persian robe—promising him, further,\n that his land should not be plundered any more and that they might\n take back the slaves that had been seized in case they should chance\n upon them anywhere. \n "
            },
            "2":{
                "0":"\n Cyrus and his\n army remained here at Tarsus twenty days, for the soldiers refused to go\n any farther; for they suspected by this time that they were going\n against the King, and they said they had not been hired for that.\n Clearchus was the first to try to force his men to go on, but they\n pelted him and his pack-animals with stones as often as they began\n to go forward. \n ",
                "1":"\n At that time Clearchus narrowly escaped being stoned to death; but\n afterwards, when he realized that he could not accomplish anything\n by force, he called a meeting of his own troops. And first he stood\n and wept for a long time, while his men watched him in wonder and\n were silent; then he spoke as follows: \n ",
                "2":"\n \n Fellow-soldiers, do not wonder that I am\n distressed at the present situation. For\n Cyrus became my friend and not only\n honoured me, an exile from my fatherland, in various ways, but\n gave me ten thousand darics. And I, receiving this money, did\n not lay it up for my own personal use or squander it in\n pleasure, but I proceeded to expend it on you. \n ",
                "3":"\n First I went to war with the\n Thracians, and for the sake of Greece I inflicted punishment upon them with\n your aid, driving them out of the Chersonese when they wanted to deprive the\n Greeks who dwelt there of their land. Then when\n Cyru s’ summons came, I took you with me\n and set out, in order that, if he had need of me, I might give\n him aid in return for the benefits I had received from\n him. \n ",
                "4":"\n But you now do not wish to continue\n the march with me; so it seems that I must either desert you and\n continue to enjoy Cyru s’ friendship, or\n prove false to him and remain with you. Whether I shall be doing\n what is right, I know not, but at any rate I shall choose you\n and with you shall suffer whatever I must. And never shall any\n man say that I, after leading Greeks into the land of the\n barbarians, betrayed the Greeks and chose the friendship of the\n barbarians; \n ",
                "5":"\n nay, since you do not care to obey\n me, I shall follow with you and suffer whatever I must. For I\n consider that you are to me both fatherland and friends and\n allies; with you I think I shall be honoured wherever I may be,\n bereft of you I do not think I shall be able either to aid a\n friend or to ward off a foe. Be sure, therefore, that wherever\n you go, I shall go also. \n ",
                "6":"\n Such were his words. And the\n soldiers—not only his own men, but the rest also—when they heard\n that he said he would not go on to the King’s capital, commended\n him; and more than two thousand of the troops under Xenias and\n Pasion took their arms and their baggage train and encamped with\n Clearchus. \n ",
                "7":"\n But Cyrus , perplexed and distressed by this\n situation, sent repeatedly for Clearchus. Clearchus refused to go to\n him, but without the knowledge of the soldiers he sent a messenger\n and told him not to be discouraged, because, he said, this matter\n would be settled in the right way. He directed\n Cyrus , however, to keep on sending for him,\n though he himself, he said, would refuse to go. \n ",
                "8":"\n After this Clearchus gathered together\n his own soldiers, those who had come over to him, and any others who\n wanted to be present, and spoke as follows: Fellow-soldiers, it is clear that the relation of\n Cyrus to us is precisely the same as\n ours to him; that is, we are no longer his soldiers, since we\n decline to follow him, and likewise he is no longer our\n paymaster. \n ",
                "9":"\n I know, however, that he considers\n himself wronged by us. Therefore, although he keeps sending for\n me, I decline to go, chiefly, it is true, from a feeling of\n shame, because I am conscious that I have proved utterly false\n to him, but, besides that, from fear that he may seize me and\n inflict punishment upon me for the wrongs he thinks he has\n suffered at my hands. \n ",
                "10":"\n In my opinion, therefore, it is no\n time for us to be sleeping or unconcerned about ourselves; we\n should rather be considering what course we ought to follow\n under the present circumstances. And so long as we remain here\n we must consider, I think, how we can remain most safely; or,\n again, if we count it best to depart at once, how we are to\n depart most safely and how we shall secure provisions—for\n without provisions neither general nor private is of any\n use. \n ",
                "11":"\n And remember that while this\n Cyrus is a valuable friend when he is\n your friend, he is a most dangerous foe when he is your enemy;\n furthermore, he has an armament—infantry and cavalry and\n fleet—which we all alike see and know about; for I take it that\n our camp is not very far away from him. It is time, then, to\n propose whatever plan any one of you deems best. With\n these words he ceased speaking. \n ",
                "12":"\n Thereupon various speakers arose, some\n of their own accord to express the opinions they held, but others at\n the instigation of Clearchus to make clear the difficulty of either\n remaining or departing without the consent of\n Cyrus . \n ",
                "13":"\n One man in particular, pretending to be in a hurry to proceed back to\n Greece with all speed,\n proposed that they should choose other generals as quickly as\n possible, in case Clearchus did not wish to lead them back;\n secondly, that they should buy provisions—the market was in the\n barbarian army!—and pack up their baggage; then, to go to\n Cyrus and ask for vessels to sail away in;\n and if he would not give them vessels, to ask him for a guide to\n lead them homeward through a country that was friendly; and if he\n would not give them a guide, either, to form in line of battle with\n all speed and likewise to send a force to occupy the mountain\n heights in advance, in order that neither Cyrus \n nor the Cilicians should forestall them— and we\n have in our possession, he said, many\n of these Cilicians and much of their property that we have\n seized as plunder. Such were the words of this\n speaker. \n ",
                "14":"\n After him Clearchus said merely this:\n Let no one among you speak of me as the man\n who is to hold this command, for I see many reasons why I should\n not do so; say rather that I shall obey to the best of my\n ability the man whom you choose, in order that you may know that\n I understand as well as any other person in the world how to be\n a subordinate also. \n ",
                "15":"\n After he had spoken another man arose to point out the foolishness of\n the speaker who had urged them to ask for vessels, just as if\n Cyrus were going home again, and to point\n out also how foolish it was to ask for a guide from this man whose enterprise we are ruining. Indeed, if we\n propose to trust the guide that Cyrus gives\n us, what is to hinder us from directing\n Cyrus also to occupy the heights for us\n in advance? \n ",
                "16":"\n For my part, I should hesitate to\n embark on the vessels that he might give us, for fear of his\n sinking us with his war-ships, and I should be afraid to follow\n the guide that he might give, for fear of his leading us to a\n place from which it will not be possible to escape; my choice\n would be, in going off without Cyru s’\n consent, to go off without his knowledge—and that is not\n possible. \n ",
                "17":"\n Now in my own opinion the plans just\n proposed are nonsense; rather, I think we should send to\n Cyrus men of the proper sort, along\n with Clearchus, to ask him what use he wishes to make of us; and\n if his enterprise is like the sort of one in which he employed\n mercenaries before, I think that we also should follow\n him and not be more cowardly than those who went up with him on\n the former occasion; \n ",
                "18":"\n if, however, his enterprise is found\n to be greater and more laborious and more dangerous than the\n former one, we ought to demand that he should either offer\n sufficient persuasion and lead us on with him, or\n yield to our persuasion and let us go home in friendship; for in\n this way, if we should follow him, we should follow as friends\n and zealous supporters, and if we should go back, we should go\n back in safety. I propose, further, that our representatives\n should report back to us whatever reply he may make, and that we\n after hearing it should deliberate about the matter. \n ",

They did see, they said, the royal\n standard, a kind of golden eagle on a shield, raised aloft upon a\n pole. \n ",
                "12":"\n But when at this point also the Greeks resumed their forward\n movement, the horsemen at once proceeded to leave the hill; they did\n not keep together, however, as they went, but scattered in different\n directions; so the hill became gradually cleared of the horsemen,\n till at last they were all gone. \n ",
                "13":"\n Clearchus, accordingly, did not lead the army up the hill, but halted\n at its foot and sent Lycius the Syracusan and another man to the\n summit, directing them to observe what was beyond the hill and\n report back to him. \n ",

                "16":"\n So they took counsel for themselves as to whether they should remain\n where they were and bring the baggage train thither, or return to\n their camp. The decision was to return, and they reached their tents\n about supper-time. \n ",
                "17":"\n Such was the conclusion of this day. They found most of their\n property pillaged, in particular whatever there was to eat or drink,\n and as for the wagons loaded with flour and wine which\n Cyrus had provided in order that, if ever\n serious need should overtake the army, he might have supplies to\n distribute among the Greeks (and there were four hundred of these\n wagons, it was said), these also the King and his men had now\n pillaged. \n ",
                "18":"\n The result was that most of the Greeks had no dinner; and they had\n had no breakfast, either, for the King had appeared before the time\n when the army was to halt for breakfast. Thus it was, then that they\n got through this night. \n "

If,\n however, anyone seeks to injure us, we shall try with the help\n of the gods to retaliate. On the other hand, if anyone is kind\n enough to do us a service, we shall not, so far as we have the\n power, be outdone in doing a service to him. \n ",

                "38":"\n Secondly, when you have appointed\n all the leaders that are necessary, I think you would perform a\n very opportune act if you should gather together the rest of the\n soldiers also and try to encourage them. \n ",
                "39":"\n For, as matters stand now, perhaps\n you have observed for yourselves in what dejection they came to\n their quarters and in what dejection they proceeded to their\n picket duty; and so long as they are in this state, I know not\n what use one could make of them, if there should be need of them\n either by night or by day. \n ",
                "40":"\n If, however, we can turn the current\n of their minds, so that they shall be thinking, not merely of\n what they are to suffer, but likewise of what they are going to\n do, they will be far more cheerful. \n ",
                "41":"\n For you understand, I am sure, that\n it is neither numbers nor strength which wins victories in war;\n but whichever of the two sides it be whose troops, by the\n blessing of the gods, advance to the attack with stouter hearts,\n against those troops their adversaries generally refuse to\n stand. \n ",
                "42":"\n And in my own experience, gentlemen,\n I have observed this other fact, that those who are anxious in\n war to save their lives in any way they can, are the very men\n who usually meet with a base and shameful death; while those who\n have recognized that death is the common and inevitable portion\n of all mankind and therefore strive to meet death nobly, are\n precisely those who are somehow more likely to reach old age and\n who enjoy a happier existence while they do live. \n ",
                "43":"\n We, then, taking to heart this\n lesson, so suited to the crisis which now confronts us, must be\n brave men ourselves and call forth bravery in our\n fellows. \n ",
                "44":"\n With these words Xenophon ceased speaking. After him Cheirisophus said: Hitherto, Xenophon, I have known you only to the extent of\n having heard that you were an Athenian, but now I commend you\n both for your words and your deeds, and I should be glad if we\n had very many of your sort; for it would be a blessing to the\n entire army. \n ",
                "45":"\n And now, gentlemen, he went\n on, let us not delay; withdraw and choose your\n commanders at once, you who need them, and after making your\n choices come to the middle of the camp and bring with you the\n men you have selected; then we will call a meeting there of all\n the troops. And let us make sure, he added, that Tolmides, the herald, is present. \n ",
                "46":"\n With these words he got up at once, that there might be no delay in\n carrying out the needful measures. Thereupon the commanders were\n chosen, Timasion the Dardanian in place of Clearchus, Xanthicles the\n Achaean in place of Socrates, Cleanor the Arcadian in place of\n Agias, Philesius the Achaean in place of Menon, and Xenophon the\n Athenian in place of Proxenus. \n "
            },
            "1":{
                "0":"\n When these elections had been\n completed, and as day was just about beginning to break, the\n commanders met in the middle of the camp; and they resolved to\n station outposts and then call an assembly of the soldiers. As soon\n as they had come together, Cheirisophus the Lacedaemonian arose\n first and spoke as follows: \n ",
                "1":"\n \n Fellow-soldiers, painful indeed is our present\n situation, seeing that we are robbed of such generals and\n captains and soldiers, and, besides, that Ariaeus and his men,\n who were formerly our allies, have betrayed us; \n ",
                "2":"\n nevertheless, we must quit ourselves\n like brave men as well as may be in these circumstances, and\n must not yield, but rather try to save ourselves by glorious\n victory if we can; otherwise, let us at least die a glorious\n death, and never fall into the hands of our enemies alive. For\n in that case I think we should meet the sort of sufferings that\n I pray the gods may visit upon our foes. \n ",
                "3":"\n Then Cleanor the Orchomenian arose and\n spoke as follows: Come, fellow-soldiers, you see\n the perjury and impiety of the King; you see likewise the\n faithlessness of Tissaphernes. It was Tissaphernes who said that he was a neighbour of\n Greece and that he\n would do his utmost to save us; it was none other than he who\n gave us his oaths to confirm these words; and then he,\n Tissaphernes, the very man who had given such pledges, was the\n very man who deceived and seized our generals. More than that,\n he did not even reverence Zeus, the god of hospitality; instead,\n he entertained Clearchus at his own table and then made that very act the\n means of deceiving and destroying the generals. \n ",
                "4":"\n Ariaeus, too, whom we were ready to\n make king, with\n whom we exchanged pledges not\n to betray one another, even he, showing neither fear of the gods\n nor honour for the memory of Cyrus dead,\n although he was most highly honoured by\n Cyrus living, has now gone over to the\n bitterest foes of that same Cyrus , and is\n trying to work harm to us, the friends of\n Cyrus . \n ",
                "5":"\n Well, may these men be duly punished\n by the gods; we, however, seeing their deeds, must never again\n be deceived by them, but must fight as stoutly as we can and\n meet whatever fortune the gods may please to send. \n ",
                "6":"\n Hereupon Xenophon arose, arrayed for\n war in his finest dress. For he thought that if the gods should\n grant victory, the finest raiment was suited to victory; and if it\n should be his fate to die, it was proper, he thought, that inasmuch\n as he had accounted his office worthy of the most beautiful attire,\n in this attire he should meet his death. He began his speech as\n follows: \n ",
                "7":"\n \n The perjury and faithlessness of the barbarians\n has been spoken of by Cleanor and is understood, I imagine, by\n the rest of you. If, then, it is our desire to be again on terms\n of friendship with them, we must needs feel great despondency\n when we see the fate of our generals, who trustingly put\n themselves in their hands; but if our intention is to rely upon\n our arms, and not only to inflict punishment upon them for their\n past deeds, but henceforth to wage implacable war with them, we\n have—the gods willing—many fair hopes of deliverance. \n ",
                "8":"\n As he was saying this a man\n sneezed, and when the soldiers heard\n it, they all with one impulse made obeisance to the god; and Xenophon said, I move, gentlemen, since at the moment when we\n were talking about deliverance an omen from Zeus the Saviour was\n revealed to us, that we make a vow to sacrifice to that god\n thank-offerings for deliverance as soon as we reach a friendly\n land; and that we add a further vow to make sacrifices, to the\n extent of our ability, to the other gods also. All who are in\n favour of this motion, he said, will\n raise their hands. And every man in the assembly raised\n his hand. Thereupon they made their vows and struck up the paean.\n These ceremonies duly performed, Xenophon began again with these\n words: \n ",
                "9":"\n \n I was saying that we have many fair hopes of\n deliverance. For, in the first place, we are standing true to\n the oaths we took in the name of the gods, while our enemies\n have perjured themselves and, in violation of their oaths, have\n broken the truce. This being so, it is fair to assume that the\n gods are their foes and our allies—and the gods are able\n speedily to make the strong weak and, when they so will, easily\n to deliver the weak, even though they be in dire\n perils. \n ",
                "10":"\n Secondly, I would remind you of the\n perils of our own forefathers, to show you not only that it is\n your right to be brave men, but that brave men are delivered,\n with the help of the gods, even out of most dreadful dangers.\n For when the Persians and their followers came with a vast array\n to blot Athens out\n of existence, the Athenians dared, unaided, to withstand them,\n and won the victory. \n ",
                "11":"\n And while they had vowed to Artemis\n that for every man they might slay of the enemy they would\n sacrifice a goat to the goddess, they were unable to find goats\n enough; so they resolved to\n offer five hundred every year, and this sacrifice they are\n paying even to this day. \n ",
                "12":"\n Again, when Xerxes at a later time\n gathered together that countless host and came against\n Greece , then too\n our forefathers were victorious, both by land and by sea, over the\n forefathers of our enemies. As tokens of these victories we may,\n indeed, still behold the trophies, but the strongest witness to\n them is the freedom of the states in which you were born and\n bred; for to no human creature do you pay homage as master, but\n to the gods alone. \n ",
                "13":"\n It is from such ancestors, then,\n that you are sprung. Now I am far\n from intending to say that you disgrace them; in fact, not many\n days ago you set yourselves in array against these descendants\n of those ancient Persians and were victorious, with the aid of\n the gods, over many times your own numbers. \n ",
                "14":"\n And then, mark you, it was in\n Cyru s’ contest for the throne that you\n proved yourselves brave men; but now, when the struggle is for\n your own safety, it is surely fitting that you should be far\n braver and more zealous. \n ",
                "15":"\n Furthermore, you ought now to be\n more confident in facing the enemy. For then you were\n unacquainted with them, you saw that their numbers were beyond\n counting, and you nevertheless dared, with all the spirit of\n your fathers, to charge upon them; but now, when you have\n already made actual trial of them and find that they have no\n desire, even though they are many times your number, to await\n your attack, what reason can remain for your being afraid of\n them? \n ",
                "16":"\n Again, do not suppose that you are the worse off because the\n followers of Ariaeus, who were formerly marshalled with us, have\n now deserted us. For they are even greater cowards than the men\n we defeated; at any rate they took to flight before them, leaving us to\n shift for ourselves. And when we find men who are ready to set\n the example of flight, it is far better to see them drawn up\n with the enemy than on our own side. \n ",
                "17":"\n But\n if anyone of you is despondent because we are without horsemen\n while the enemy have plenty at hand, let him reflect that your\n ten thousand horsemen are nothing more than ten thousand men;\n for nobody ever lost his life in battle from the bite or kick of\n a horse, but it is the men who do whatever is done in\n battles. \n ",
                "18":"\n Moreover, we are on a far surer\n foundation than your horsemen: they are hanging on their horses’\n backs, afraid not only of us, but also of falling off; while we,\n standing upon the ground, shall strike with far greater force if\n anyone comes upon us and shall be far more likely to hit\n whomsoever we aim at. In one point alone your horsemen have the\n advantage—flight is safer for them than it is for us. \n ",
                "19":"\n Suppose, however, that you do not\n lack confidence about the fighting, but are troubled because you\n are no longer to have Tissaphernes to guide you or the King to\n provide a market. If this be the case, I ask you to consider\n whether it is better to have Tissaphernes for a guide, the man\n who is manifestly plotting against us, or such people as we may\n ourselves capture and may order to serve as guides, men who will\n know that if they make any mistake in aught that concerns us,\n they will be making a mistake in that which concerns their own\n lives and limbs. \n ",
                "20":"\n And as for provisions, is it the\n better plan to buy from the market which these barbarians have\n provided—small measures for large prices, when we have no money\n left, either—or to appropriate for ourselves, in case we are\n victorious, and to use as large a measure as each one of us\n pleases? \n ",
                "21":"\n But\n in these points, let us say, you realize that our present\n situation is better; you believe, however, that the rivers are a\n difficulty, and you think you were immensely deceived when you\n crossed them; then consider whether this is not\n really a surpassingly foolish thing that the barbarians have\n done. For all rivers, even though they be impassable\n at a distance from their sources, become passable, without even\n wetting your knees, as you approach toward the\n sources. \n ",
                "22":"\n But\n assume that the rivers will not afford us a crossing and that we\n shall find no one to guide us; even in that case we ought not to\n be despondent. For we know that the Mysians, whom we should not\n admit to be better men than ourselves, inhabit many large and\n prosperous cities in the King’s territory, we know that the same\n is true of the Pisidians, and as for the Lycaonians we even saw with our own eyes that\n they had seized the strongholds in the plains and were reaping\n for themselves the lands of these Persians; \n ",
                "23":"\n so, in our case, my own view would\n be that we ought not yet to let it be seen that we have set out\n for home; we ought, rather, to be making our arrangements as if\n we intended to settle here. For I know that to the Mysians the\n King would not only give plenty of guides, but plenty of\n hostages, to guarantee a safe conduct for them out of his\n country; in fact, he would build a road for them, even if they\n wanted to take their departure in four-horse chariots. And I\n know that he would be thrice glad to do the same for us, if he\n saw that we were preparing to stay here. \n ",
                "24":"\n I really fear, however, that if we\n once learn to live in idleness and luxury, and to consort with\n the tall and beautiful women and maidens of these Medes and\n Persians, we may, like the lotus-eaters, forget our homeward\n way. \n ",
                "25":"\n Therefore, I think it is right and\n proper that our first endeavour should be to return to our\n kindred and friends in Greece , and to point out to the Greeks that it\n is by their own choice that they are poor; for they could bring\n here the people who are now living a hard life at home, and\n could see them in the enjoyment of riches. It is really a plain fact, gentlemen, that all these\n good things belong to those who have the strength to possess\n them; \n ",
                "26":"\n but I must go on to another point,\n how we can march most safely and, if we have to fight, can fight\n to the best advantage. In the first place, then, Xenophon\n proceeded, I think we should burn up the wagons\n which we have, so that our cattle may not be our captains, but\n we can take whatever route may be best for the army. Secondly,\n we should burn up our tents also; for these, again, are a bother\n to carry, and no help at all either for fighting or for\n obtaining provisions. \n ",
                "27":"\n Furthermore, let us abandon all our\n other superfluous baggage, keeping only such articles as we use\n for war, or in eating and drinking, in order that we may have\n the largest possible number of men under arms and the least\n number carrying baggage. For when men are conquered, you are\n aware that all their possessions become the property of others;\n but if we are victorious, we may regard the enemy as our\n pack-bearers. \n ",
                "28":"\n It\n remains for me to mention the one matter which I believe is\n really of the greatest importance. You observe that our enemies\n did not muster up courage to begin hostilities against us until\n they had seized our generals; for they believed that so long as\n we had our commanders and were obedient to them, we were able to\n worst them in war, but when they had got possession of our\n commanders, they believed that the want of leadership and of\n discipline would be the ruin of us. \n ",
                "29":"\n Therefore our present commanders\n must show themselves far more vigilant than their predecessors,\n and the men in the ranks must be far more orderly and more\n obedient to their commanders now than they used to\n be. \n ",
                "30":"\n We must pass a vote that, in case\n anyone is disobedient, whoever of you may be at hand at the time\n shall join with the officer in punishing him; in this way the\n enemy will find themselves mightily deceived; for to-day they\n will behold, not one Clearchus, \n but ten thousand, who will not suffer anybody to be a bad\n soldier. \n ",
                "31":"\n But it is time now to be acting\n instead of talking; for perhaps the enemy will soon be at hand.\n Whoever, then, thinks that these proposals are good should\n ratify them with all speed, that they may be carried out in\n action. But if any other plan is thought better than mine, let\n anyone, even though he be a private soldier, feel free to\n present it; for the safety of all is the need of all. \n ",
                "32":"\n After this Cheirisophus said: We shall be able to consider presently whether we\n need to do anything else besides what Xenophon proposes, but on\n the proposals which he has already made I think it is best for\n us to vote as speedily as possible. Whoever is in favour of\n these measures, let him raise his hand. \n ",
                "33":"\n They all raised their hands. Then\n Xenophon arose once more and said: Give ear,\n gentlemen, to the further proposals I have to present. It is\n clear that we must make our way to a place where we can get\n provisions; and I hear that there are fine villages at a\n distance of not more than twenty stadia. \n ",
                "34":"\n We should not be surprised, then, if\n the enemy—after the fashion of cowardly dogs that chase\n passers-by and bite them, if they can, but run away from anyone\n who chases them—if the enemy in the same way should follow at\n our heels as we retire. \n ",
                "35":"\n Hence it will be safer, perhaps, for\n us to march with the hoplites formed into a hollow square, so\n that the baggage train and the great crowd of camp followers may\n be in a safer place. If, then, it should be settled at once who\n are to lead the square and marshal the van, who are to be on\n either flank, and who to guard the rear, we should not need to\n be taking counsel at the time when the enemy comes upon us, but\n we should find our men at once in their places ready for\n action. \n ",
                "36":"\n Now if anyone sees another plan\n which is better, let us follow that plan; but if not, I propose\n that Cheirisophus take the lead, especially since he is a\n Lacedaemonian, that the two oldest generals have charge of the\n two flanks, and that, for the present, we who are the youngest,\n Timasion and I, command the rear. \n ",
                "37":"\n And for the future, as we make trial\n of this formation we can adopt whatever course may seem from\n time to time to be best. If anyone sees a better plan, let him\n present it. No one having any opposing view to express,\n Xenophon said: Whoever is in favour of these\n measures, let him raise his hand. The motion was\n carried. \n ",
                "38":"\n \n And now, he continued, we must go back and put into execution what has\n been resolved upon. And whoever among you desires to see his\n friends again, let him remember to show himself a brave man; for\n in no other way can he accomplish this desire. Again, whoever is\n desirous of saving his life, let him strive for victory; for it\n is the victors that slay and the defeated that are slain. Or if\n anyone longs for wealth, let him also strive to conquer; for\n conquerors not only keep their own possessions, but gain the\n possessions of the conquered. \n "

When they had done all this, they set\n about preparing breakfast; and while they were so engaged,\n Mithradates \n approached with about thirty horsemen, summoned the Greek generals\n within earshot, and spoke as follows: \n ",
                "1":"\n \n Men of Greece , I was faithful to\n Cyrus , as you know for yourselves, and\n I am now friendly to you; indeed, I am tarrying here in great\n fear.

                "4":"\n The generals consequently decided that it was best to pass a decree\n that there should be no negotiations with the enemy in this war so\n long as they should be in the enemy’s country.

                "30":"\n In these villages they remained for\n three days, not only for the sake of the wounded, but likewise\n because they had provisions in abundance—flour, wine, and great\n stores of barley that had been collected for horses, all these\n supplies having been gathered together by the acting satrap of the\n district. \n ",
                "31":"\n On the fourth day they proceeded to descend into the plain.

                "32":"\n When they had encamped, and the barbarians, approaching toward the\n village, essayed to attack them at long range, the Greeks had much\n the better of it; for to occupy a position and therefrom ward off an\n attack was a very different thing from being on the march and\n fighting with the enemy as they followed after. \n ",
                "33":"\n As soon as it came to be late in the\n afternoon, it was time for the enemy to withdraw. For in no instance\n did the barbarians encamp at a distance of less than sixty stadia\n from the Greek camp, out of fear that the Greeks might attack them\n during the night. \n ",
                "34":"\n For a Persian army at night is a sorry thing. Their horses are\n tethered, and usually hobbled also to prevent their running away if\n they get loose from the tether, and hence in case of any alarm a\n Persian has to put saddle-cloth and bridle on his horse, and then\n has also to put on his own breastplate and mount his horse—and all\n these things are difficult at night and in the midst of confusion.\n It was for this reason that the Persians encamped at a considerable\n distance from the Greeks. \n ",
                "35":"\n When the Greeks became aware that they\n were desirous of withdrawing and were passing the word along, the\n order to pack up luggage was proclaimed to the Greek troops within\n hearing of the enemy. For a time the barbarians delayed their\n setting out, but when it began to grow late, they went off; for they\n thought it did not pay to be on the march and arriving at their camp\n in the night. \n ",
                "36":"\n When the Greeks saw at length that they were manifestly departing,\n they broke camp and took the road themselves, and accomplished a\n march of no less than sixty stadia. Thus the two armies got so far\n apart that on the next day the enemy did not appear, nor yet on the\n third; on the fourth day, however, after pushing forward by night\n the barbarians occupied a high position on the right of the road by\n which the Greeks were to pass, a spur of the mountain, namely, along\n the base of which ran the route leading down into the plain. \n ",
                "37":"\n As soon as Cheirisophus observed that\n the spur was already occupied, he summoned Xenophon from the rear,\n directing him to come to the front and bring the peltasts with\n him. \n ",
                "38":"\n Xenophon, however, would not bring the peltasts, for he could see\n Tissaphernes and his whole army coming into view; but he\n rode forward himself and asked, Why are you\n summoning me? Cheirisophus replied, It is perfectly evident; the hill overhanging our downward road\n has been occupied, and there is no getting by unless we dislodge\n these people. \n ",
                "39":"\n Why did you not bring the\n peltasts? Xenophon answered that he had not thought it\n best to leave the rear unprotected when hostile troops were coming\n into sight. Well, at any rate, said\n Cheirisophus, it is high time to be thinking how\n we are to drive these fellows from the height. \n ",
                "40":"\n Then Xenophon observed that the summit of the mountain was close\n above their own army and that from this summit there was a way of\n approach to the hill where the enemy were; and he said, Our best plan, Cheirisophus, is to drive with all\n speed for the mountain top; for if we once get possession of\n that, those men above our road will not be able to hold their\n position. If you choose, then, stay in command of the army, and\n I will go; or, if you prefer, you make for the mountain top, and\n I will stay here. \n ",
                "41":"\n \n Well, said Cheirisophus, I leave it to you to choose whichever part you\n wish. Then Xenophon, with the remark that he was the\n younger, elected to go, but he urged Cheirisophus to send with him\n some troops from the front; for it would have been too long a\n journey to bring up men from the rear. \n ",
                "42":"\n Cheirisophus accordingly sent with him the peltasts at the front,\n replacing them with those that were inside the square; he also\n ordered the three hundred picked men under his own\n command at the front of the square to join Xenophon’s force. \n ",
                "43":"\n Then they set out with all possible\n speed. But no sooner had the enemy upon the hill observed their dash\n for the summit of the mountain than they also set off, to race with\n the Greeks for this summit. \n ",
                "44":"\n Then there was a deal of shouting from the Greek army as they urged\n on their friends, and just as much shouting from Tissaphernes’\n troops to urge on their men. \n ",
                "45":"\n And Xenophon, riding along the lines upon his horse, cheered his\n troops forward: My good men, he said,\n believe that now you are racing for\n Greece , racing this\n very hour back to your wives and children, a little toil for\n this one moment and no more fighting for the rest of our\n journey. \n ",
                "46":"\n But Soteridas the Sicyonian said: We are not on\n an equality, Xenophon; you are riding on horseback, while I am\n desperately tired with carrying my shield. \n ",
                "47":"\n When Xenophon heard that, he leaped down from his horse and pushed\n Soteridas out of his place in the line, then took his shield away\n from him and marched on with it as fast as he could; he had on also,\n as it happened, his cavalry breastplate, and the result was that he\n was heavily burdened. And he urged the men in front of him to keep\n going, while he told those who were behind to pass along by him, for\n he found it hard to keep up. \n ",
                "48":"\n The rest of the soldiers, however, struck and pelted and abused\n Soteridas until they forced him to take back his shield and march\n on. Then Xenophon remounted, and as long as riding was possible, led\n the way on horseback, but when the ground became too difficult, he\n left his horse behind and hurried forward on foot.

As for provisions,\n there was an abundance for the Greeks to take, and the houses were\n also supplied with bronze vessels in great numbers; the Greeks,\n however, did not carry off any of these, and did not pursue the\n people themselves, refraining from harshness on the chance that the\n Carduchians might perhaps be willing to let them pass through their\n country in friendship, seeing that they also were enemies of the\n King; \n ",
                "8":"\n but they did take whatever they chanced upon in the way of\n provisions, for that was necessary. The Carduchians, however, would\n neither listen when they called to them nor give any other sign of\n friendliness. \n ",
                "9":"\n And when the rearguard of the Greeks was descending from the summit\n of the pass to the villages—and by this time it was dark, for on\n account of the road being narrow their ascent and descent lasted\n through the entire day—at this moment some of the Carduchians\n gathered together and attacked the hindmost Greeks; and they killed\n some and wounded others severely with stones and arrows, though they\n were themselves but few in number; for the Greek army had come upon\n them unexpectedly. \n ",
                "10":"\n If, however, a larger number of them had gathered together at that\n time, a great part of the army would have been in danger of being\n destroyed. Thus the Greeks bivouacked for that night in the\n villages, while the Carduchians kindled many fires round about upon\n the mountains and kept shouting to one another. \n ",
                "11":"\n At daybreak the generals and captains\n of the Greeks came together and resolved to keep with them on the\n march only the indispensable and most powerful baggage animals and\n to leave the rest behind; likewise, to let go all the newly-taken\n captives that were in the army, to the last man. \n ",
                "12":"\n For the baggage animals and the captives, numerous as they were, made\n the march slow, and the large number of men who had charge of them\n were thus taken out of the fighting line; besides, with so many\n people to feed it was necessary to procure and to carry twice the\n amount of provisions. This decision once reached, they published the\n order to carry it into effect. \n ",
                "13":"\n When they had breakfasted and were\n setting out upon the march, the generals quietly stationed men in\n the defile and proceeded to take away from the troops such of the\n things specified as had not been given up if they found any; and the\n soldiers submitted, except in cases where a man had smuggled through\n a handsome boy or woman, for example, that he had set his heart\n upon. So they went on for that day, now fighting a little and now\n resting. \n ",
                "14":"\n On the next day there was a heavy storm, but they had to continue\n their march, for they had not an adequate supply of provisions; and\n Cheirisophus led the way while Xenophon commanded the rearguard. \n ",
                "15":"\n Here the enemy began a vigorous attack, and in the narrow places on\n the road came close up to discharge their bows and slings. The\n result was that the Greeks were forced to give chase and then fall\n back, and hence made but slow progress; and time after time, when\n the enemy pressed them hard, Xenophon would send word to\n Cheirisophus to wait a little. \n ",
                "16":"\n Now while Cheirisophus was accustomed to wait whenever such word was\n given, on this occasion he did not do so, but led on rapidly and\n passed back the order to keep up with him. It was evident,\n therefore, that something was the matter, but there was no time to\n go forward and find out the reason for his haste; consequently the\n progress of the rearguard became more like a flight than a\n march. \n ",
                "17":"\n Then it was that a brave man was killed, Leonymus the Laconian, who\n was pierced in the side by an arrow that went through his shield and\n cuirass; also Basias the Arcadian, who was shot clean through the\n head. \n ",
                "18":"\n As soon as they reached a halting\n place, Xenophon went straight to Cheirisophus, just as he was, and\n proceeded to reproach him for not waiting, but compelling them to\n flee and fight at the same time; and now, \n he went on, two fine, brave fellows have lost\n their lives, and we were not able to pick up their bodies or\n bury them. \n ",
                "19":"\n Cheirisophus’ reply was, Take a look, said\n he, at the mountains, and observe how impassable\n all of them are. The only road is the one there, which you see,\n a steep one, too, and on that you can see the great crowd of\n people who have taken possession of it and are guarding our way\n out. \n ",
                "20":"\n That’s the reason why I was hurrying\n and why I would not wait for you, for I hoped to reach the pass\n and occupy it before they did. The guides that we have say there\n is no other road. \n ",
                "21":"\n And Xenophon answered, Well, I also have two men.\n For at the time when the enemy were giving us trouble, we set an\n ambush. It allowed us, for one thing, to catch our breath; but,\n besides, we killed a number of them, and we took especial pains\n to get some prisoners for this very purpose, of being able to\n employ as guides men who know the country. \n ",
                "22":"\n They brought up the two men at once\n and questioned them separately as to whether they knew any other\n road besides the one that was in plain sight. The first man said he\n did not, despite all the numerous threats that were made to him; and\n since he would give no information, he was slaughtered before the\n eyes of the second one. \n ",
                "23":"\n The latter now said that the reason why this first man had maintained\n that he did not know any other road, was because he chanced to have\n a daughter living in that neighbourhood with a husband to whom he\n had given her; but as for himself, he said that he would lead the\n Greeks by a road that could be traversed even by baggage\n animals. \n ",
                "24":"\n Upon being asked whether there was any point on it which was\n difficult to pass, he replied that there was a height which they\n could not possibly pass unless they should seize it beforehand. \n ",

                "26":"\n Volunteers came forward, from the hoplites Aristonymus of Methydrium and Agasias of\n Stymphalus, while in rivalry with them Callimachus of Parrhasia said that he was ready\n to make the expedition and take with him volunteers from the entire\n army; for I know, he continued, that many of the young men will follow if I am in\n the lead. \n ",
                "27":"\n Then they asked whether any one among the captains of light troops\n wanted to join in the march. The volunteer was Aristeas of Chios,\n who on many occasions proved himself valuable to the army for such\n services. \n "

                "4":"\n Now I know that we shall have far\n more trouble if you are conveyed by sea, for upon us will fall\n the duty of providing the ships; while if you journey by land,\n upon you will fall the task of doing the fighting. \n ",
                "5":"\n Nevertheless, I must say what I\n believe; for I am acquainted with both the country of the\n Paphlagonians and their power. Their country possesses these two\n things, the fairest plains and the loftiest\n mountains. \n ",
                "6":"\n And, in the first place, I know at\n once where you must make your entry: there is no place save\n where the peaks of the mountains rise high on either side of the\n road; holding these peaks a mere handful of men could command\n the pass, and if they are so held, not all the men in the world\n could effect a passage. All this I could even point out if you\n should care to send some one to the spot with me. \n ",
                "7":"\n Secondly, I know that they have\n plains and a cavalry which the barbarians themselves regard as\n superior to the whole of the King’s cavalry. Indeed, only now\n these Paphlagonians have failed to present themselves when the\n King summoned them, for their ruler is too proud to\n obey. \n ",
                "8":"\n If\n you should, after all, find yourselves able not only to seize\n the mountains, whether by stealth or by anticipating the enemy,\n but also on the plain to conquer in battle both their cavalry\n and their more than one hundred and twenty thousand infantry,\n you will come to the rivers. First is the Thermodon, three\n plethra in width, which I fancy would be difficult to cross,\n especially with great numbers of the enemy in front and great\n numbers following behind; second, the Iris, likewise three\n plethra wide; third, the Halys, not less than two stadia in\n width, which you could not cross without boats—and who will\n there be to supply you with boats?—and similarly impassable is\n the Parthenius also, to which you would come if you should get\n across the Halys. \n ",
                "9":"\n For\n my part, therefore, I believe that this journey is not merely\n difficult for you, but a thing of utter impossibility. If you go\n by sea, however, you can coast along from here to Sinope , and from Sinope to\n Heracleia; and from Heracleia on there is no difficulty either\n by land or by water, for there are ships in abundance at\n Heracleia. \n ",
                "10":"\n When he had thus spoken, some of his\n hearers were suspicious that he spoke as he did out of friendship\n for Corylas, for he was his official representative at Sinope;\n others imagined that he even had the idea of obtaining gifts on\n account of this advice; while still others suspected that the real\n purpose of his speech was to prevent the Greeks from going by land\n and so doing some harm to the territory of the Sinopeans. At any\n rate, however, the Greeks voted to make the journey by sea. \n ",

For Xenophon, \n they went on, wishes and is urging that as soon\n as the ships come, we should then say all of a sudden to the\n army: \n ",
                "19":"\n Soldiers, now\n we see that you are without means either to supply\n yourselves with provisions on the homeward voyage, or to do\n anything for your people at home when you have got back\n there; but if you wish to pick out some spot in the country\n that lies round about the Euxine and put to shore wherever\n you may wish—he who so desires to go back home and he who so\n desires to stay behind—here are your ships, so that you\n could make a sudden attack at whatever point you may\n wish. \n ",
                "20":"\n Upon hearing this statement the\n merchants carried it back to their cities; and along with them\n Timasion the Dardanian sent Eurymachus the Dardanian and Thorax the\n Boeotian to tell the same story. When the Sinopeans and Heracleots\n heard it, they sent to Timasion and urged him to take in charge, for\n a fee, the matter of getting the army to sail away. \n ",
                "21":"\n He received this proposal gladly, and when the soldiers were gathered\n in assembly addressed them as follows: You ought\n not, soldiers, to set your thoughts on remaining here, nor to\n esteem anything more highly than Greece . But I hear that certain people are\n offering sacrifices over this matter, with not so much as a word\n to you. \n ",
                "22":"\n Now I promise, in case you set sail\n from here, to provide you with pay from the first of the month\n at the rate of a Cyzicene per month to each man; and I\n will take you to Troas ,\n the place from which I am an exile, and my city will be at your\n service; for they will receive me willingly. \n ",

It was ridiculous, he\n said, when there was plenty of fertile land in Greece , to be hunting for it in\n the domain of the barbarians. \n ",
                "25":"\n \n And until you reach that spot, he\n continued, I also, like Timasion, promise you\n regular pay.

                "26":"\n Then Philesius and Lycon the Achaeans\n rose and said that it was outrageous for Xenophon to be privately\n urging people to settle down and sacrificing with a view to that\n plan, while publicly saying not a word about the matter. Thus\n Xenophon was compelled to rise and speak as follows: \n ",
                "27":"\n \n I offer, soldiers, as you see, all the\n sacrifices I can both on your behalf and my own in order that I\n may perchance say and think and do such things as will be\n fairest and best both for you and me. And in the present case I\n was sacrificing for guidance on this point only, whether it was\n better to begin to speak before you and to act regarding this\n project, or not to touch the matter at all. \n ",
                "28":"\n Now Silanus , the soothsayer, answered me in respect\n to the main issue that the omens were favourable (for he knew\n well enough that I was not unacquainted with divination, from\n being always present at the sacrifices); but he said that there\n appeared in the omens a kind of fraud and plot against me,\n manifestly because he knew that he was himself plotting to\n traduce me before you. For he spread abroad the report that I\n was intending to do these things at once, without getting your\n consent. \n ",
                "29":"\n Now if I saw that you were without\n resources, I should be looking about for a plan by which you\n might get possession of a city, with the provision that\n afterwards he who chose might sail back home at once, while he\n who did not wish to go at once might return after he had\n accumulated enough to bestow a little something upon his people\n at home. \n ",
                "30":"\n But since, in fact, I see that the\n Heracleots and Sinopeans are sending you the ships in which to\n sail away, and that men are promising you pay from the first of\n the month, it seems to me it is a fine thing to be carried\n safely where we want to go and at the same time to receive pay\n for our preservation; therefore I renounce that other project\n for myself, and I say, to all those who have come to me and\n expressed the view that it ought to be carried out, that they\n also should renounce it. \n ",
                "31":"\n For I\n hold this opinion: standing together and in force, as you are\n now, I think you will be held in honour and will have\n provisions, for in strength lies the opportunity to wrest away\n the possessions of the weaker; but let yourselves get separated\n and your force broken up into small parts, and you would neither\n be able to obtain food to live on nor would you come off\n unharmed. \n ",
                "32":"\n I think, therefore, just as you do,\n that we should set out for Greece , and that if it does come to pass that\n any man is caught deserting before the entire army is in a place\n of safety, he should be brought to trial as a wrong-doer. And\n whoever is of this opinion, he continued, let him raise his hand. Up went every\n hand. \n ",
                "33":"\n Silanus , however, began shouting, and attempted to\n say that it was fair for any one who so chose to leave the army.

                "34":"\n After that, when the Heracleots learned that it had been voted to\n sail away, and that Xenophon himself had put the question to vote,\n they did send the ships, but in the matter of the money they had\n promised to Timasion and Thorax they turned out to be deceivers. \n ",
                "35":"\n Consequently the men who had promised the pay were panic-stricken,\n and stood in fear of the army. They therefore took with them the\n other generals to whom they had communicated their earlier\n doings—namely, all the generals except Neon the Asinaean, who was\n acting as lieutenant for Cheirisophus because Cheirisophus had not\n yet returned—and came to Xenophon, with the message that they had\n changed their minds and thought it was best to sail to the\n Phasis , inasmuch as\n there were ships at hand, and seize the land of the Phasians. \n ",
                "36":"\n Their king, as it chanced, was a grandson of Aeetes.

                "4":"\n \n I hear, soldiers, that some one is bringing a\n charge against me, namely, that I am going to deceive you and\n lead you to the Phasis .\n In the name of the gods, then, give ear to my words, and if it\n appears that I am guilty of wrong, I ought not to leave this\n spot without paying the penalty; but if it appears to you that\n my accusers are guilty of wrong, they ought to be dealt with in\n such manner as they deserve. \n ",
                "5":"\n You doubtless know, he\n continued, where the sun rises and where it\n sets; likewise, that if a man is to go to Greece , he must journey toward\n the west, while if he wishes to go to the lands of the\n barbarians, he must travel in the opposite direction, that is,\n toward the east. Now is there any one who could deceive you in\n this matter, by maintaining that the place where the sun rises\n is the one where it sets and the place where it sets is the one\n where it rises? \n ",
                "6":"\n Again, you surely know this also,\n that the north wind carries one out of the Euxine to Greece , while the south wind\n carries you within, to the Phasis—indeed, the saying is, When the north wind doth blow, fair voyaging\n to Greece . In\n this matter, again, is it possible that any one could deceive\n you into embarking when the south wind is blowing? \n ",
                "7":"\n But I am going to put you aboard,\n you may say, when it is calm. Well, I shall be sailing on one\n ship, you on a hundred at least. How, then, could I either force\n you to voyage along with me if you did not choose, or deceive\n you into following my lead? \n ",
                "8":"\n But suppose you have been deceived\n and bewitched by me and we have come to the Phasis ; we accordingly\n disembark upon the shore; you will perceive, likely enough, that\n you are not in Greece ;\n and I, who have done the deceiving, will be one lone man, while\n you, the deceived, will be close to ten thousand, with arms in\n your hands. Then how could a man bring down punishment upon\n himself more surely than by planning in that way for himself and\n for you? \n ",
                "9":"\n Nay,\n these are the stories of foolish men, jealous of me because I\n enjoy honour at your hands. And yet they should not in fairness\n feel such jealousy; for whom among them do I hinder either from\n saying any good word he can before you, or from fighting if he\n will in your behalf and his own, or from being watchful in his\n care for your safety? Well, then, do I stand in any one’s way\n when you are choosing commanders? I yield, let him be commander;\n only let it be shown that he renders you good\n service. \n ",
                "10":"\n For my part, however, what I have\n said on these points seems to me sufficient; but if any one\n among you imagines either that he could be deceived himself by\n such tales, or could deceive another by these tales, let him\n speak and explain. \n ",
                "11":"\n And when you have had enough of\n this, do not go away until you have heard what manner of evil I\n see beginning to show itself in the army; for if it comes upon\n us and proves to be as serious as it now shows signs of being,\n it is time for us to be taking counsel for ourselves, in order\n that we may not stand revealed as most wicked and base men, both\n in the sight of gods and mankind, of friends and\n enemies. \n ",
                "12":"\n Upon hearing these words the soldiers\n fell to wondering what the thing was, and they bade Xenophon go on.\n So he began again: You know, perhaps, that in\n the mountains there were barbarian strongholds, friendly to the\n Cerasuntians, from which people would come down and sell you\n cattle and other things which they had, and also, I believe,\n some of you went to the nearest of these strongholds and did\n some buying and came back again. \n ",

                "14":"\n It was his intention, in case he\n should capture this stronghold, not to come back again to the\n army, but to embark on a vessel upon which his messmates chanced\n to be sailing along the coast, to put aboard whatever plunder he\n might secure, and sailing out of the Euxine to go away. Indeed,\n as I now learn, his messmates on the vessel had concluded an\n agreement with him to this effect. \n ",
                "15":"\n He accordingly summoned all the men\n he could persuade, and set out at their head to march against\n the stronghold. While he was still on the march, however, the\n break of day surprised him, and the people of the place gathered\n together and, by throwing missiles and dealing blows from strong\n positions, killed Clearetus and a good many of his followers,\n although some of them did make their way back to Cerasus . \n ",

                "20":"\n While we were in session outside the\n camp, we suddenly heard a great uproar and shouts of Strike! strike! pelt! pelt! and in a\n moment we saw a crowd of men rushing toward us with stones in\n their hands and others picking up stones. \n ",
                "21":"\n And the Cerasuntians, having\n witnessed, mark you, the affair in their own city, were\n naturally terrified, and hurried back toward their ships. For\n that matter, by Zeus, there were some of our own number who were\n terrified. \n ",
                "22":"\n I went up to the men, however, and\n asked what the trouble was. Some of them did not know at all,\n but nevertheless they had stones in their hands. When I did come\n upon a man who knew, he told me that the market-clerks were\n treating the army most outrageously. \n ",

                "25":"\n I am happy,\n soldiers, since I am a human being, to be honoured by you, and I\n am grateful also, and I pray that the gods may grant me\n opportunity to be the means of bringing you some benefit; still,\n I think that for me to be preferred by you as commander when a\n Lacedaemonian is at hand, is not expedient for you,—for you\n would be less likely on this account to obtain any favour you\n might desire from the Lacedaemonians—and for myself, on the\n other hand, I believe it is not altogether safe. \n ",
                "26":"\n For I see that the Lacedaemonians\n did not cease waging war upon my native state until they had\n made all her citizens acknowledge that the Lacedaemonians were\n their leaders also. \n ",
                "27":"\n But just as soon as this\n acknowledgment had been made, they straightway ceased waging war\n and no longer continued to besiege the city. Now if I, being\n aware of these things, should seem to be trying to make their\n authority null and void wherever I could, I suspect that I might\n very speedily be brought back to reason on that\n point. \n ",
                "28":"\n As to your own thought, that there\n would be less factiousness with one commander than with many, be\n well assured that if you choose another, you will not find me\n acting factiously,—for I believe that when a man engaged in war\n factiously opposes a commander, that man is factiously opposing\n his own safety; but if you choose me, I should not be surprised\n if you should find some one else feeling angry both with you and\n with myself. \n ",
                "29":"\n When he had thus spoken, a much larger\n number of people arose, saying that he ought to be commander.

Will the\n Lacedaemonians also be angry, he said, if guests at dinner come together and fail to\n choose a Lacedaemonian as master of the feast? For if the matter\n stands in that way, we are not free even to be captains, it\n would seem, because we are Arcadians. Thereupon the\n soldiers raised a shout, saying that Agasias was quite right. \n ",
                "30":"\n Then Xenophon, seeing that something\n more was needed, came forward and spoke again: Well, soldiers, he said, that you\n may understand the matter fully I swear to you by all the gods\n and goddesses that in very truth, so soon as I became aware of\n your intention, I offered sacrifices to learn whether it was\n best for you to entrust to me this command and for me to\n undertake it; and the gods gave me such signs in the sacrifices\n that even a layman could perceive that I must withhold myself\n from accepting the sole command. \n ",
                "31":"\n Under these circumstances, then, they\n chose Cheirisophus. And after being chosen Cheirisophus came forward\n and spoke as follows: Well, soldiers, be sure of\n this, that I also should not have acted factiously if you had\n chosen another; as for Xenophon, however, he continued,\n you did him a kindness by not choosing him;\n for even now Dexippus \n has already been falsely accusing him, as far as he could, to\n Anaxibius, even though I tried hard to silence him. He said he\n believed that Xenophon would rather share the command of\n Clearchus’ army with Timasion, a Dardanian, than with himself, a\n Laconian. \n ",

On the following day all the soldiers held a\n meeting, the chief movers in the matter being Agasias the\n Stymphalian, a captain, Hieronymus the Elean, also a captain, and\n some others from among the eldest of the Arcadians. \n ",
                "10":"\n They passed a resolution that if any man from this time forth should\n suggest dividing the army, he should be punished with death, and\n further, that the army should return to the same organization which\n formerly obtained, and that the former generals should resume\n command. Now by this time Cheirisophus had died, from the effects of\n a medicine which he took for a fever; and his command passed to Neon the\n Asinaean. \n ",
                "11":"\n After this Xenophon rose and said:\n Fellow soldiers, our journey, it seems, must\n be made by land, for we have no ships; and we must set out at\n once, for we have no provisions if we remain here. We,\n then, he continued, will sacrifice,\n and you must prepare yourselves to fight if ever you did; for\n the enemy have renewed their courage. \n ",
                "12":"\n Thereupon the generals proceeded to sacrifice, the soothsayer who was\n present being Arexion the Arcadian; for Silanus the Ambraciot had by\n this time stolen away, \n on a vessel which he hired at Heracleia. When they sacrificed,\n however, with a view to their departure, the victims would not prove\n favourable, \n ",
                "13":"\n and they accordingly ceased their offerings for that day. Now some\n people had the effrontery to say that Xenophon, in his desire to\n found a city at this spot, had induced the soothsayer to declare\n that the sacrifices were not favourable for departure. \n ",
                "14":"\n Consequently he made public proclamation that on the morrow any one\n who so chose might be present at the sacrifice, and if a man were a\n soothsayer, he sent him word to be at hand to participate in the\n inspection of the victims; so he made the offering in the immediate\n presence of many witnesses. \n ",
                "15":"\n But though he sacrificed a second and a third time with a view to\n departure, the victims would not prove favourable. At that the\n soldiers were angry, for the provisions they brought with them had\n given out and there was not yet any market at hand. \n ",
                "16":"\n Therefore they held a meeting and\n Xenophon addressed them again. Soldiers, \n he said, as for setting out upon our journey,\n the sacrifices, as you see, do not yet prove favourable for\n that; but I am aware that you are in need of provisions; hence\n it seems to me that we must sacrifice in regard to this latter\n point alone. Then some one rose and said: \n ",
                "17":"\n \n There appears to be good reason why our\n sacrifices are not favourable; for as I heard from a man who\n chanced to arrive here yesterday on a ship, Cleander, the\n Lacedaemonian governor at Byzantium , is to come here with merchant\n vessels and men-of-war. \n ",
                "18":"\n At that news all deemed it best to stay, but it was still necessary\n to go out after provisions. With this object in view Xenophon again\n sacrificed, going as far as three offerings, and the victims\n continued unfavourable. By this time people were even coming to\n Xenophon’s tent and declaring that they had no provisions, but he\n said that he would not lead forth unless the sacrifices turned out\n favourable. \n ",
                "19":"\n On the next day he undertook to\n sacrifice again, and pretty nearly the entire army—for it was a\n matter of concern to every man—gathered about the place of\n sacrifice; but the victims had given out. Then the generals, while\n refusing to lead the men forth, called them together in\n assembly; \n ",
                "20":"\n and Xenophon said: It may be that the enemy are\n gathered together and that we must fight; if, then, we should\n leave our baggage in the strong place and set out prepared for battle, perhaps our\n sacrifices would be successful. \n ",
                "21":"\n Upon hearing this, however, the soldiers cried out that it was not at\n all necessary to enter the place, but, rather, to offer sacrifice\n with all speed. Now they no longer had any sheep, but they bought a\n bullock that was yoked to a wagon and proceeded to sacrifice; and\n Xenophon requested Cleanor the Arcadian to give special attention to\n see if there was anything auspicious in this offering. But not even\n so did the omens prove favourable. \n ",
                "22":"\n Now Neon was general in place of\n Cheirisophus, and when he saw in what a terrible condition the\n soldiers were from want, he was desirous of doing them a kindness;\n so having found a certain Heracleot who claimed to know of villages\n near at hand from which it was possible to get provisions, he made\n proclamation that all who so wished were to go after provisions and\n that he would be their leader. There set out accordingly, with\n poles, wine-skins, bags, and other vessels, about two\n thousand men. \n ",
                "23":"\n But when they had reached the villages and were scattering here and\n there for the purpose of securing plunder, they were attacked first\n of all by the horsemen of Pharnabazus; for they had come to the aid of the\n Bithynians, desiring in company with the Bithynians to prevent the\n Greeks, if they could, from entering Phrygia ; these horsemen killed no fewer than five\n hundred of the soldiers, the rest fleeing for refuge to the\n heights. \n ",
                "24":"\n After this one of the men who escaped brought back word to the camp\n of what had happened. And Xenophon, inasmuch as the sacrifices had\n not proved favourable on that day, took a bullock that was yoked to\n a wagon,—for there were no other sacrificial animals,—offered it up,\n and set out to the rescue, as did all the rest who were under thirty\n years of age, to the last man. \n ",
                "25":"\n And they picked up the survivors and returned to the camp. By this\n time it was about sunset, and the Greeks were making preparations\n for dinner in a state of great despondency when suddenly through the\n thickets some of the Bithynians burst upon the outposts, killing\n some of them and pursuing the rest up to the camp. \n ",
                "26":"\n An outcry was raised, and all the Greeks ran to their arms; still, it\n did not seem safe to undertake a pursuit or to move the camp during\n the night, seeing that the region was thickly overgrown; so they\n spent the night under arms, keeping plenty of sentinels on\n watch. \n "

Before\n breakfast time came, they proceeded to dig a trench across the way\n of approach to the place, and they backed it along its\n entire length with a palisade, leaving three gates. And now a vessel\n arrived from Heracleia, bringing barley meal, sacrificial victims,\n and wine. \n ",
                "1":"\n Xenophon arose early and sacrificed\n with a view to an expedition, and with the first offering the omens\n turned out favourable.

                "8":"\n \n It seems to me, fellow generals, that we should\n station reserve companies behind our phalanx, so that we may\n have men to come to the aid of the phalanx if aid is needed at\n any point, and that the enemy, after they have fallen into\n disorder, may come upon troops that are in good order and\n fresh. All shared this opinion. \n ",

                "10":"\n So while the others led on quietly, he detached the three hindmost\n battalions, consisting of two hundred men each, and turned the first\n one to the right with orders to follow after the phalanx at a\n distance of about a plethrum; this battalion was commanded by\n Samolas the Achaean; the second battalion he posted at the centre,\n to follow on in the same way; this one was under the command of\n Pyrrhias the Arcadian; and the last one he stationed upon the left,\n Phrasias the Athenian being in command of it. \n ",
                "11":"\n Now when, as they advanced, the men\n who were in the lead reached a large ravine, difficult to pass, they\n halted, in doubt as to whether they ought to cross the ravine; and\n they passed along word for generals and captains to come up to the\n front. \n ",
                "12":"\n Then Xenophon, wondering what it was that was holding up the march\n and speedily hearing the summons, rode forward in all haste. As soon\n as the officers had come together, Sophaenetus, who was the eldest\n of the generals, said that it was not a question worth considering\n whether they ought to cross such a ravine as that. \n ",
                "13":"\n Xenophon rejoined, with much\n earnestness: Well, gentlemen, you know that I\n have never yet introduced you to any danger that was a matter of\n choice; for as I see the situation, you do not stand in need of\n reputation for bravery, but of a safe return. \n ",
                "14":"\n But the conditions at this moment\n are these: there is no possibility of our getting away from here\n without a battle; for if we do not advance upon the enemy\n ourselves, they will follow us when we undertake to retire and\n fall upon us. \n ",
                "15":"\n Consider, then, whether it is better\n to go forward against these men with arms advanced, or with arms\n reversed to behold the enemy coming upon us from behind. \n \n ",
                "16":"\n Yet you know that to retire before\n an enemy does not beseem any man of honour, while to be in\n pursuit creates courage even in cowards. For my part, at any\n rate, I should rather advance to the attack with half as many\n men than to retreat with twice as many. And as to those troops\n yonder, I know that if we advance upon them, you do not\n yourselves expect them to await our attack, while if we retire,\n we all know that they will have the courage to pursue\n us. \n ",
                "17":"\n Again, to cross a difficult ravine\n and get it in your rear when you are about to fight, is not that\n an opportunity really worth seizing? For it is to the enemy that\n I should myself wish to have all roads seem easy—for their\n retreat; as for ourselves, we ought to learn from the very\n ground before us that there is no safety for us except in\n victory. \n ",
                "18":"\n I do wonder, however, that any one\n regards this particular ravine as more dreadful than the rest of\n the country we have just marched through.

                "19":"\n Again, if we do reach the sea in\n safety, what a great ravine, one may say, is the Euxine! where\n we have neither ships to take us away nor food to subsist upon\n if we remain, while the sooner we reach there, the sooner we\n shall have to be off again in quest of provisions. \n ",
                "20":"\n Well, then, it is better to fight\n to-day, with our breakfast already eaten, than to-morrow\n breakfastless.

These\n fellows, now that they have seen us at all, must not again get a\n pleasant dinner or encamp wherever they please. \n ",
                "21":"\n After that the captains bade him lead\n on, and no one spoke in opposition. So he led the way, after giving\n orders that every man should cross at whatever point along the\n ravine he chanced to be; for it seemed that in this way the army\n would get together on the further side more quickly than if they\n defiled along the bridge which was over the ravine. \n ",
                "22":"\n When they had crossed, he went along the lines and said: Soldiers, remember how many battles you have won,\n with the help of the gods, by coming to close quarters, remember\n what a fate they suffer who flee from the enemy, and bethink you\n of this, that we are at the doors of Greece . \n ",

                "26":"\n But when the phalanx of the hoplites kept moving on to meet them,\n marching rapidly, and at the same time the trumpet sounded, and they\n struck up the paean and after that raised the battle-cry, and at the\n same moment couched their spears, then the enemy no longer awaited\n the attack, but took to flight. \n ",
                "27":"\n Timasion and the cavalry pursued, and killed as many as they could,\n considering their own small numbers.

                "28":"\n As soon as the Greeks saw that they were standing their ground there,\n they deemed it the easiest and safest course to charge upon them\n immediately. They accordingly struck up the paean and moved upon\n them at once; and they stood no longer. Thereupon the peltasts\n pursued until the right wing was dispersed; but few of the enemy,\n however, were killed, for his cavalry, numerous as they were,\n inspired fear. \n ",

                "30":"\n Thereupon the enemy’s horsemen fled down the slope just as if they\n were being pursued by horsemen; for a ravine was waiting to receive them,\n although the Greeks were not aware of the fact and hence turned\n aside from their pursuit before reaching it; for it was now late in\n the day. \n ",
                "31":"\n So after returning to the spot where the first encounter took place\n and erecting a trophy, they set out on their way back to the sea at\n about sunset; and the distance to the camp was about sixty\n stadia. \n "

                "23":"\n It was from that sort of a fellow,\n then, that I rescued his prisoner.

And believe that if you now put me to death, you are\n putting to death a good man for the sake of a coward and a\n scoundrel. \n ",
                "24":"\n Upon hearing these words Cleander said\n that he had no commendation for Dexippus if he had behaved in this\n way, but that he nevertheless thought that even if Dexippus were an\n utter scoundrel, he ought not to have suffered violence; rather, he continued, he should first have had a trial, just as you are yourselves\n asking in the present case, and should then have received his\n punishment. \n ",
                "25":"\n For the moment, therefore, go away,\n leaving this man here with me, and when I issue the order, be\n present for the trial. And I bring no charge either against the\n army or any other person now that this man himself admits that\n he rescued the prisoner. \n ",
                "26":"\n Then the one who had been rescued said: For\n myself, Cleander, in case you really imagine that I was being\n led off for some wrong doing, I neither struck nor stoned\n anybody, but merely said that the sheep were public property.\n For a resolution had been passed by the soldiers that if any one\n should do any plundering on his own account when the entire army\n went out, what he secured was to be public property. \n ",
                "27":"\n That was what I said, and thereupon\n this fellow seized me and proceeded to lead me off, in order\n that nobody might utter a word, but that he might save the booty\n for the plunderers in violation of the ordinance—and get his own\n share out of it. In reply to this Cleander said: Well, since that is your statement, stay behind,\n so that we can take up your case also. \n ",
                "28":"\n After that Cleander and his party\n proceeded to breakfast; and Xenophon called a meeting of the army\n and advised the sending of a delegation to Cleander to intercede for\n the men. \n ",

                "30":"\n So Xenophon came before him and said: You have\n the men, Cleander, and the army has submitted to you and allowed\n you to do what you pleased both with these men and with their\n entire body. But now they beg and entreat you to give them the\n two men, and not to put them to death; for many are the labours\n these two have performed for the army in the past. \n ",
                "31":"\n Should they obtain this favour at\n your hands, they promise you in return that, if you wish to be\n their leader and if the gods are propitious, they will show you\n not only that they are orderly, but that they are able, with the\n help of the gods, while yielding obedience to their commander,\n to feel no fear of the enemy. \n ",
                "32":"\n They make this further request of\n you, that when you have joined them and assumed command of them,\n you make trial both of Dexippus and of the rest of them to see\n how the two sorts of men compare, and then give to each his\n deserts. \n ",
                "33":"\n Upon hearing these words Cleander replied: Well,\n by the twin gods, my answer\n to you all will be speedy indeed. I give you the two men and I\n will myself join you, and if the gods so grant, I will lead you\n to Greece . These words\n of yours are decidedly the opposite of what I have been hearing\n about you from some people, namely, that you were trying to make\n the army disloyal to the Lacedaemonians. \n ",
                "34":"\n After this they thanked him and\n departed, taking the two men with them; and Cleander undertook\n sacrifices with a view to the journey and associated amicably with\n Xenophon, so that the two men struck up a friendship. Furthermore,\n when Cleander came to see for himself that the troops carried out\n their orders with good discipline, he was more than ever eager to\n become their commander. \n ",
                "35":"\n When, however, although he continued his sacrifices over three days,\n the victims would not prove favourable, he called a meeting of the\n generals and said: The victims do not prove\n favourable to me as the man to lead you onward; but it is not\n for you to be despondent on that account, since to you, as it\n seems, is given the office of delivering these soldiers. To the\n road, then! And we shall give you, when you have reached your\n journey’s end, as splendid a reception as we can. \n ",
                "36":"\n Thereupon the soldiers voted to\n present to him the sheep that were public property, and he accepted\n them, but gave them back again to the troops. Then he sailed away.\n And the soldiers, after selling the corn they had gathered together\n and the other booty they had secured, set out on their march through\n the country of the Bithynians. \n ",
                "37":"\n But when in following the direct road they failed to find any booty,\n to enable them to reach friendly territory with a little something\n in hand, they resolved to turn about and take the opposite direction\n for one day and night.

                "17":"\n When they had got near it, he came upon watch-fires with no one about\n them. And at first he supposed that Seuthes had shifted his camp to\n some other place; but when he became aware of a general uproar and\n heard Seuthes’ followers signalling to one another, he comprehended\n that the reason Seuthes had his watch-fires kindled in front of the\n pickets was in order that the pickets might remain unseen, in the\n darkness as they were, so that no one could tell either how many\n they were or where they were, while on the other hand people who\n were approaching could not escape notice, but would be visible in\n the light of the fires. \n ",
                "18":"\n When he did see pickets, he sent\n forward the interpreter he chanced to have and bade them tell\n Seuthes that Xenophon had come and desired to meet with him. They\n asked whether he was an Athenian from the army. \n ",
                "19":"\n And when Xenophon made reply that he was the man, they leaped up and\n hastened off; and a little afterwards about two hundred peltasts\n appeared, took Xenophon and his party, and proceeded to conduct them\n to Seuthes. \n ",
                "20":"\n He was in a tower and well guarded, and all around the tower were\n horses ready bridled; for out of fear he gave his horses their\n fodder by day, and by night kept them ready bridled to guard himself\n with. \n ",
                "21":"\n For there was a story that in time gone by Teres, an ancestor of\n Seuthes, being in this region with a large army, lost many of his\n troops and was robbed of his baggage train at the hands of the\n people of this neighbourhood; they were the Thynians, and were said\n to be the most warlike of all men, especially by night. \n ",
                "22":"\n When the Greek party had drawn near,\n Seuthes directed Xenophon to come in, with any two men he might\n choose to bring with him. As soon as they were inside, they first\n greeted one another and drank healths after the Thracian fashion in\n horns of wine; and Seuthes had Medosades present also, the same man\n who went everywhere as his envoy. \n ",
                "23":"\n After that Xenophon began the speaking: You sent\n to me, Seuthes, first at Calchedon, this man Medosades, with the\n request that I make every effort on your behalf to bring the\n army across from Asia ,\n and with the promise that if I should do this, you would treat\n me well—as Medosades here declared. \n ",
                "24":"\n After saying this, he asked Medosades whether this statement of the\n matter was a true one. He replied that it was. Medosades here came to me a second time after I had crossed\n over from Parium to rejoin the army, and promised that if I\n should bring the army to you, you would not only treat me in all\n ways as a friend and a brother, but in particular would give me\n the places on the seacoast of which you hold\n possession. \n ",
                "25":"\n Hereupon he again asked Medosades whether this was what he said, and\n he again agreed that it was. Come, now, \n Xenophon went on, tell Seuthes what answer I\n made you that first time at Calchedon. \n ",
                "26":"\n \n You answered that the army was going to cross\n over to Byzantium \n and there was no need, so far as that was concerned, of paying\n anything to you or any one else; you also stated that when you\n had got across, you were yourself to leave the army; and it\n turned out just as you said. \n ",
                "27":"\n \n What then did I say, Xenophon asked,\n at the time when you came to me near\n Selymbria ? \n You said that the project was not possible, but\n that you were going to Perinthus and intended to cross over from\n there to Asia . \n ",
                "28":"\n \n Well, then, said Xenophon, at this moment I am here myself, along with\n Phryniscus here, one of the generals, and Polycrates yonder, one\n of the captains, and outside are representatives of the other\n generals except Neon the Laconian, in each case the man most\n trusted by each general. \n ",
                "29":"\n If you wish, therefore, to have the\n transaction better safeguarded, call them in also. Go and say to\n them, Polycrates, that I direct them to leave their arms behind,\n and do you yourself leave your sabre out there before coming\n back again. \n ",
                "30":"\n Upon hearing these words Seuthes said\n that he should not distrust any one who was an Athenian; for he\n knew, he said, that the Athenians were kinsmen of his, and he believed they\n were loyal friends. After this, when those who were to be present\n had come in, Xenophon began by asking Seuthes what use he wanted to\n make of the army. \n ",
                "31":"\n Then Seuthes spoke as follows: Maesades was my\n father, and his realm embraced the Melanditae, the Thynians, and\n the Tranipsae. Now when the affairs of the Odrysians fell into a\n bad state, my father was driven out of this country, and\n thereafter sickened and died, while I, the son, was brought up\n as an orphan at the court of Medocus, the present\n king. \n ",
                "32":"\n When I became a young man, however,\n I could not endure to live with my eyes turned toward another’s\n table; so I sat myself down on the same seat with Medocus as a\n suppliant and besought him to give me as many men as he could,\n in order that I might inflict whatever harm I could upon those\n who drove us out, and might live without turning my eyes toward\n his table. \n ",
                "33":"\n Thereupon he gave me the men and the\n horses that you will see for yourselves as soon as day has come.\n And now I live with them, plundering my own ancestral land. But\n if you should join me, I think that with the aid of the gods I\n could easily recover my realm. It is this that I\n want. \n ",
                "34":"\n \n What, then, said Xenophon, should you be able, in case we came, to give to\n the rank and file, to the captains, and to the generals? Tell\n us, so that these men here may carry back word. \n ",
                "35":"\n And Seuthes promised to give to each soldier a Cyzicene, to the captains twice as much, and to the\n generals four times as much; furthermore, as much land as they might\n wish, yokes of oxen, and a fortified place upon the seacoast. \n ",
                "36":"\n \n But, said Xenophon, if we make this attempt and do not succeed, because of some\n intimidation on the part of the Lacedaemonians, will you receive\n into your country any one who may wish to leave the army and\n come to you? \n ",
                "37":"\n And he replied: Nay, more than that, I will make\n you my brothers, table-companions, sharers to the uttermost in\n all that we may find ourselves able to acquire. And to you,\n Xenophon, I will also give my daughter, and if you have a\n daughter, I will buy her after the Thracian fashion; and I will\n give you for a residence Bisanthe , the very fairest of all the places I\n have upon the seacoast. \n "

                "1":"\n When day came, Aristarchus again summoned the generals; but they\n resolved to disregard the summons of Aristarchus and instead to call\n a meeting of the army. And all the troops gathered except Neon’s\n men, who were encamped about ten stadia away. \n ",
                "2":"\n When they had gathered, Xenophon arose and spoke as follows: Soldiers, as for sailing across to the place where\n we wish to go, Aristarchus with his triremes prevents our doing\n that; the result is, that it is not safe for us to embark upon\n boats; but this same Aristarchus directs us to force our way to\n the Chersonese , through\n the Sacred Mountain ; and if we make ourselves masters of the\n mountain and get to the Chersonese , he says that he will not sell you\n any more, as he did at Byzantium , that you will not be cheated any\n more but will receive pay, and that he will not shut his eyes\n any more, as he does now, to your being in want of\n provisions. \n ",
                "3":"\n So much for what Aristarchus says;\n but Seuthes says that if you come to him, he will treat you\n well. Now, therefore, make up your minds whether you will\n consider this question here and now or after you have set forth\n in quest of provisions. \n ",
                "4":"\n My own opinion is, seeing that here\n we neither have money with which to buy nor are permitted to\n take anything without money, that we ought to set forth to the\n villages from which we are permitted to take, since their\n inhabitants are weaker than ourselves, and that there, possessed\n of provisions and hearing what the service is that one wants us\n for, we should choose whatever course may seem best to\n us. \n ",
                "5":"\n Whoever, he said, holds this opinion, let him raise his hand. \n Every hand was raised. Go away, then, \n Xenophon continued, and pack up, and when the\n word is given, follow the van. \n ",
                "6":"\n After this Xenophon led the way and\n the troops followed. Neon, indeed, and messengers from Aristarchus\n tried to persuade them to turn back, but they would not listen to\n them. When they had advanced as much as thirty stadia, Seuthes met\n them. And Xenophon, catching sight of him, bade him ride up to the\n troops, in order that he might tell him within hearing of the\n greatest possible number what they had decided upon as\n advantageous. \n ",
                "7":"\n When he had come up, Xenophon said: We are on our\n way to a place where the army will be able to get food; there we\n shall listen both to you and to the Laconian’s messengers,\n and make whatever choice may seem to be best. If, then, you will\n guide us to a spot where there are provisions in greatest\n abundance, we shall think we are being hospitably entertained by\n you. \n ",

                "9":"\n \n Lead on, then, said Xenophon. When they\n had reached the villages, in the afternoon, noon, the soldiers\n gathered together and Seuthes spoke as follows: I ask you, soldiers, to take the field with me, and I promise\n to give to you who are in the ranks a Cyzicene and to the\n captains and generals the customary pay; besides this, I shall\n honour the man who deserves it. Food and drink you will obtain,\n just as to-day, by taking from the country; but whatever may be\n captured I shall expect to retain for myself, so that by selling\n it I may provide you your pay. \n ",
                "10":"\n All that flees and hides we shall\n ourselves be able to pursue and seek out; but if any one offers\n resistance, with your help we shall try to subdue\n him. \n ",
                "11":"\n Xenophon asked, And how far from the seacoast shall you expect\n the army to follow you? He replied, Nowhere more than a seven days’ journey, and in many places\n less. \n ",
                "12":"\n After this the opportunity to speak\n was offered to any one who desired it; and many spoke to the same\n effect, saying that Seuthes’ proposals were most valuable; for the\n season was winter, and it was impossible to sail back home, if that\n was what one wished, and impossible also to get along in a friendly\n country if they had to maintain themselves by purchasing; on the\n other hand, to spend their time and get their maintenance in a\n hostile country was a safer proceeding in Seuthes’ company than if\n they were alone. And if, above and beyond such important advantages,\n they were also to receive pay, they counted it a godsend. \n ",
                "13":"\n After that Xenophon said: If any one holds a\n contrary opinion, let him speak; if not, I will put this\n question to vote. And as no one spoke in opposition, he\n put the matter to vote, and this plan was decided upon. So he told\n Seuthes at once that they would take service with him. \n ",
                "14":"\n After this the troops went into camp\n by divisions, but the generals and captains were invited to dinner\n by Seuthes in a village he was occupying near by. \n ",
                "15":"\n When they had reached his doors and were about to go in to dinner,\n there stood a certain Heracleides, of Maroneia ; this fellow\n came up to each single one of the guests who, as he imagined, were\n able to make a present to Seuthes, first of all to some people of\n Parium who had come to arrange a\n friendship with Medocus, the king of the Odrysians, and brought\n gifts with them for him and his wife; to them Heracleides said that\n Medocus was a twelve days’ journey inland from the sea, while\n Seuthes, now that he had got this army, would be master upon the\n coast. \n ",
                "16":"\n He, therefore, Heracleides went on, being your neighbour, will be best able to do you\n good or harm. Hence if you are wise, you will present to him\n whatever you bring with you; and it will be better for you than\n if you make your gifts to Medocus, who dwells far away. \n It was in this way that he tried to persuade these people. \n ",
                "17":"\n Next he came up to Timasion the Dardanian,—for he heard that he had\n some Persian drinking cups and carpets,—and said that it was\n customary when Seuthes invited people to dinner, for those who were\n thus invited to give him presents. And, \n he continued, in case this Seuthes becomes a\n great man in this region, he will be able either to restore you\n to your home or to make you rich here. Such\n were the solicitations he used as he went to one man after\n another. \n ",
                "18":"\n He came up to Xenophon also, and said to him: You\n are a citizen of a very great state and your name is a very\n great one with Seuthes; perhaps you will expect to obtain\n fortresses in this land, as others among your countrymen have\n done, and\n territory; it is proper, therefore, for you to honour Seuthes in\n the most magnificent way. \n ",
                "19":"\n It is out of good-will to you that I\n give this advice for I am quite sure that the greater the gifts\n you bestow upon this man, the greater the favours that you will\n receive at his hands. Upon hearing this Xenophon was\n dismayed; for he had come across from Parium with nothing but a boy\n and money enough for his travelling expenses. \n ",
                "20":"\n When they had come in for the\n dinner—the noblest of the Thracians who were present, the generals\n and the captains of the Greeks, and whatever embassy from any state\n was there—the dinner was served with the guests seated in a circle;\n then three-legged tables were brought in for the whole company;\n these were full of meat, cut up into pieces, and there were great\n loaves of leavened bread fastened with skewers to the pieces of\n meat. \n ",
                "21":"\n In general the tables were placed opposite the strangers in each\n case; for the Thracians had a custom which Seuthes now took the lead\n in practising,—he would pick up the loaves which lay beside him,\n break them into small pieces, and throw the pieces to whomever he\n pleased, following the same fashion with the meat also, and leaving\n himself only enough for a mere taste. \n ",
                "22":"\n Then the others also who had tables placed opposite them, set about\n doing the same thing. But a certain Arcadian named Arystas, a\n terrible eater, would have none of this throwing about, but took in\n his hand a loaf as big as a three-quart measure, put some pieces of\n meat upon his knees, and proceeded to dine. \n ",
                "23":"\n They carried round horns of wine, and all took them; but Arystas,\n when the cupbearer came and brought him his horn, said to the man,\n after observing that Xenophon had finished his dinner, Give it to him; for he’s already at leisure, but\n I’m not as yet. \n ",
                "24":"\n When Seuthes heard the sound of his voice, he asked the cupbearer\n what he was saying. And the cupbearer, who understood Greek, told\n him. So then there was an outburst of laughter. \n ",
                "25":"\n When the drinking was well under way,\n there came in a Thracian with a white horse, and taking a full horn\n he said: I drink your health, Seuthes, and\n present to you this horse; on his back pursuing you shall catch\n whomever you choose, and retreating you shall not fear the\n enemy. \n ",
                "26":"\n Another brought in a boy and presented him in the same way, with a\n health to Seuthes, while another presented clothes for his wife.\n Timasion also drank his health and presented to him a silver bowl\n and a carpet worth ten minas. \n ",
                "27":"\n Then one Gnesippus, an Athenian, arose and said that it was an\n ancient and most excellent custom that those who had possessions\n should give to the king for honour’s sake, and that to those who had\n nought the king should give, so that, he\n continued, I too may be able to bestow gifts\n upon you and do you honour. \n ",
                "28":"\n As for Xenophon, he was at a loss to know what he should do; for he\n chanced, as one held in honour, to be seated on the stool nearest to\n Seuthes. And Heracleides directed the cupbearer to proffer him the\n horn. Then Xenophon, who already as it happened had been drinking a\n little, arose courageously after taking the horn and said: \n ",
                "29":"\n And I, Seuthes, give you myself and these my\n comrades to be your faithful friends; and not one of them do I\n give against his will, but all are even more desirous than I of\n being your friends. \n ",
                "30":"\n And now they are here, asking you\n for nothing more, but rather putting themselves in your hands\n and willing to endure toil and danger on your behalf. With them,\n if the gods so will, you will acquire great territory,\n recovering all that belonged to your fathers and gaining yet\n more, and you will acquire many horses, and many men and fair\n women; and these things you will not need to take as plunder,\n but my comrades of their own accord shall bring them before you\n as gifts. \n ",
                "31":"\n Up rose Seuthes, drained the horn with Xenophon, and joined him in\n sprinkling the last drops. After this there came in\n musicians blowing upon horns such as they use in giving signals, and\n playing upon trumpets of raw ox-hide not only measured notes, but\n music like that of a harp. \n ",
                "32":"\n And Seuthes himself got up, raised a war-cry, and sprang aside very\n nimbly, as though avoiding a missile. There entered also a company\n of buffoons. \n ",
                "33":"\n When the sun was about setting, the\n Greeks arose and said that it was time to post sentinels and give\n out the watchword. They also urged Seuthes to issue an order that\n none of the Thracians were to enter the Greek camp by night; for, they said, our\n enemies are Thracians and our friends are\n yourselves. \n ",
                "34":"\n As the Greeks were setting forth, Seuthes arose with them, not in the\n least like a drunken man. And after coming out he called the\n generals aside by themselves and said: Gentlemen, our enemies do not yet know of our alliance;\n therefore if we go against them before they have got on guard\n against being captured or have made preparations to defend\n themselves, we should most surely get both captives and\n property. \n ",
                "35":"\n The generals agreed in approving this plan, and bade him lead on. And\n he said: Get yourselves ready and wait; and when\n the proper time comes, I will return to you and, picking up my\n peltasts and yourselves, will lead the way with my\n horsemen. \n ",
                "36":"\n And Xenophon said: Well, now, consider this\n point, whether, if we are to make a night march, the Greek\n practice is not the better: in our marches by day, you know,\n that part of the army takes the lead which is suited to the\n nature of the ground in each case, whether it be hoplites or\n peltasts or cavalry; but by night it is the practice of the\n Greeks that the slowest arm should lead the way; \n ",
                "37":"\n for thus the various parts of the\n army are least likely to become separated, and men are least\n likely to drop away from one another without knowing it; and it\n often happens that scattered divisions fall in with one another\n and in their ignorance inflict and suffer harm. \n ",
                "38":"\n Then Seuthes replied: You are right, and I will\n adopt your practice. I will give you guides from among the oldest men, who know\n the country best, and I myself will bring up the rear with my\n horsemen; for I can speedily reach the front if need be. \n Then they gave out Athena as the watchword, on\n account of their kinship. After\n this conference they went to rest. \n ",
                "39":"\n When it was about midnight, Seuthes\n was at hand with his horsemen armed with breast-plates and his\n peltasts equipped with their arms. And as soon as he had given over\n their guides to the Greeks, the hoplites took the lead, the peltasts\n followed, and the horsemen brought up the rear. \n ",
                "40":"\n When day came, Seuthes rode along to the front and expressed his\n approval of the Greek practice. For many times, he said, while\n marching by night with even a small force he himself, along with his\n cavalry, had got separated from his infantry; but now, he continued, we find\n ourselves at daybreak all together, just as we should be. But do\n you wait where you are and take a rest, and I will return after\n I have looked around a little. With these words he rode\n off along a mountain side, following a kind of road. \n ",
                "41":"\n When he had reached a place where there was deep snow, he looked\n about to see whether there were human footprints, either leading\n onward or back. As soon as he saw that the road was untrodden, he\n quickly returned and said: \n ",
                "42":"\n All will be well, gentlemen, if god will; for we\n shall fall upon these people before they know it. Now I will\n lead the way with the cavalry, so that if we catch sight of any\n one, he may not slip through our fingers and give word to the\n enemy; and do you follow after me, and in case you get left\n behind, keep to the trail of the horses. Once we have crossed\n over the mountains, we shall come to many prosperous\n villages. \n ",
                "43":"\n By the time it was midday he was\n already upon the heights, and catching sight of the villages below\n he came riding up to the hoplites and said: Now\n I am going to let the horsemen charge down to the plain on the\n run, and to send the peltasts against the villages. Do you,\n then, follow as fast as you can, so that if any resistance is\n offered, you may meet it. \n ",
                "44":"\n Upon hearing these words Xenophon dismounted from his horse. And\n Seuthes asked: Why do you dismount, for there is\n need of haste? \n I know, Xenophon replied, that I am not the only one you need; and the\n hoplites will run faster and more cheerfully if I also am on\n foot leading the way. \n ",
                "45":"\n After this Seuthes went off, and with him Timasion at the head of\n about forty horsemen of the Greeks. Then Xenophon gave orders that\n the active men up to thirty years of age should move up from their\n several companies to the front. So he himself ran along with them,\n while Cleanor led the rest. \n ",
                "46":"\n When they had reached the villages, Seuthes with about thirty\n horsemen rode up to him and said: Here’s the\n very thing, Xenophon, that you were saying; these fellows are caught, but unhappily my\n horsemen have gone off unsupported, scattering in their pursuit,\n and I fear that the enemy may get together somewhere in a body\n and work some harm. On the other hand, some of us also must\n remain in the villages, for they are full of people. \n ",
                "47":"\n Well, Xenophon replied, I myself with the troops I have will seize the\n heights, and do you direct Cleanor to extend his line through\n the plain alongside the villages. When they had done\n these things, there were gathered together captives to the number of\n a thousand, two thousand cattle, and ten thousand smaller animals\n besides.

                "1":"\n Then he dispatched Heracleides to Perinthus to sell the booty, so\n that he might get money to pay the soldiers with; while he himself\n and the Greeks encamped on the plain of the Thynians, the\n inhabitants abandoning their homes and fleeing to the mountains. \n ",
                "2":"\n There was deep snow on the plain, and it was so cold that the water\n which they carried in for dinner and the wine in the jars would\n freeze, and many of the Greeks had their noses and ears\n frost-bitten. \n ",

Thereupon the women, children, and older men did come down,\n but the younger men bivouacked in the villages under the\n mountain. \n ",
                "5":"\n And Seuthes, upon learning of this, ordered Xenophon to take the\n youngest of the hoplites and follow him.

                "7":"\n So Xenophon went to Seuthes and begged him not to kill the boy,\n telling him of Episthenes’ turn of mind, how he had once assembled a\n battalion with an eye to nothing else save the question whether a\n man was handsome, and that with this battalion he proved himself a\n brave man. \n ",
                "8":"\n And Seuthes asked: Would you even be willing,\n Episthenes, to die for this boy’s sake? Then Episthenes\n stretched out his neck and said, Strike, if the\n lad bids you and will be grateful. \n ",
                "9":"\n Seuthes asked the boy whether he should strike Episthenes in his\n stead. The boy forbade it, and besought him not to slay either.\n Thereupon Episthenes threw his arms around the boy and said: It is time, Seuthes, for you to fight it out with\n me for this boy; for I shall not give him up. \n ",
                "10":"\n And Seuthes laughed and let the matter go. He resolved, however, to\n establish a camp where they were, in order that the people on the\n mountain should not be supplied with food from these villages,\n either. \n So he himself went quietly down the mountain and encamped upon the\n plain, while Xenophon with his picked men took quarters in the\n uppermost village below the summit and the rest of the Greeks close\n by, among the so-called mountain \n Thracians. \n ",
                "11":"\n Not many days had passed after this\n when the Thracians on the mountain came down and entered into\n negotiations with Seuthes in regard to a truce and hostages.

But Seuthes bade him have no\n fear and showed him hostages that had come from the enemy. \n ",

                "16":"\n Then the Thracians took to flight, swinging their shields around\n behind them, as was their custom; and some of them who tried to jump\n over the palings were captured hanging in the air, with their\n shields caught in the stakes, while others missed the ways that led\n out and were killed; and the Greeks continued the pursuit till they\n were outside the village. \n ",
                "17":"\n Some of the Thynians, however, turned about in the darkness and\n hurled javelins at men who were running along past a burning house,\n throwing out of the darkness toward the light; and they wounded\n Hieronymus the Epitalian, a captain, and Theogenes the Locrian, also\n a captain; no one, however, was killed, but some men had clothes and\n baggage burned up. \n ",

And from the instant he learned of\n the trouble, through all the time that he was hurrying to the\n rescue, every moment his horn was kept sounding; the result was,\n that this also helped to inspire fear in the enemy. When he did\n arrive, he clasped their hands and said that he had supposed he\n should find many of them slain. \n ",
                "19":"\n After this Xenophon asked Seuthes to\n give over the hostages to him and to join him on an expedition to\n the mountain, if he so pleased; otherwise, to let him go by\n himself. \n ",
                "20":"\n On the next day, accordingly, Seuthes gave over the hostages—men\n already elderly and the most powerful, so it was said, of the\n mountaineers—and came himself with his troops. Now by this time\n Seuthes had a force quite three times as large as before; for many\n of the Odrysians, hearing what success Seuthes was enjoying, came\n down from the upper country to take service with him. \n ",
                "21":"\n And when the Thynians saw from their mountain masses of hoplites,\n masses of peltasts, and troops of horsemen, they descended and\n besought him to grant them a truce, agreeing to do anything and\n everything and urging him to receive pledges. \n ",
                "22":"\n Thereupon Seuthes summoned Xenophon, disclosed to him the proposals\n they were making, and said that he should not grant them a truce if\n Xenophon wanted to punish them for their attack. \n ",
                "23":"\n And Xenophon said: Why, for my part I think I\n have abundant satisfaction as it is, if these people are to be\n slaves instead of free men. He added, however, that he\n advised Seuthes to take as hostages in the future those who were\n most capable of doing harm and to leave the old men at home.

                "31":"\n Again, that the Thracians who have\n now fallen under your sway would far more eagerly go against you\n than with you, is quite certain; for when you are conqueror\n their lot is slavery, and when you are conquered it is\n freedom. \n ",
                "32":"\n And\n if you need henceforth to take some thought for the sake of this\n land also, seeing that it is yours, in which case do you suppose\n it would be freer from ills: if these soldiers should recover\n what they claim and go away leaving a state of peace behind\n them, or if they should remain as in a hostile country and you\n should undertake to maintain an opposing camp with other troops,\n that would have to be more numerous than these and would need\n provisions? \n ",
                "33":"\n And in which case would more money\n be spent, if what is owing to these men should be paid over to\n them, or if this sum should be left owing and you should have to\n hire other troops stronger than they are? \n ",
                "34":"\n Yes, but Heracleides thinks, as he\n used to explain to me, that this sum of money is a very large\n one.

                "35":"\n For it is not number that determines\n what is much and what is little, but the capacity of the man who\n pays and of him who receives. And as for yourself, your yearly\n income is going to be greater now than all the property you\n possessed amounted to before. \n ",
                "36":"\n For\n my part, Seuthes, it was out of regard for you as a friend that\n I urged this course, in order that you might be deemed worthy of\n the good things which the gods have given to you and that I\n might not lose credit with the army. \n ",
                "37":"\n For be well assured that at present\n if I should wish to inflict harm upon a foe, I could not do it\n with this army, and if I should wish to come to your assistance\n again, I should not find myself able to do that; such is the\n feeling of the army toward me. \n ",
                "38":"\n And yet I make your own self my\n witness, along with the gods, who know, that I have neither\n received anything from you that was intended for the soldiers,\n nor have ever asked what was theirs for my private use, nor\n demanded from you what you had promised me; \n ",
                "39":"\n and I swear to you that even if you\n had offered to pay what was due to me, I should not have\n accepted it unless the soldiers also were at the same time to\n recover what was due to them.

                "40":"\n And yet Heracleides thinks that\n everything is but nonsense in comparison with possessing money,\n by hook or by crook; but I believe, Seuthes, that no possession\n is more honourable for a man, especially a commander, or more\n splendid than valour and justice and generosity. \n ",
                "41":"\n For he who possesses these things is\n rich because many are his friends, and rich because still others\n desire to become his friends; if he prospers he has those who\n will rejoice with him, and if he meets with a mischance he does\n not lack those who will come to his aid. \n ",
                "42":"\n But\n if you neither learned from my deeds that I was your friend from\n the bottom of my heart nor are able to perceive this from my\n words, at least give a thought to what the soldiers say with one\n accord; for you were present and heard what those who wished to\n censure me said. \n ",

                "46":"\n But truly I have confidence, not\n only that time will teach you that you must resolve to pay what\n is due, but also that you will not yourself endure to see those\n men who have freely given you good service, accusing you.

                "47":"\n Upon hearing these words Seuthes\n cursed the man who was to blame for the fact that the soldiers’\n wages had not been paid long ago; and everybody suspected that\n Heracleides was that man; for I, said\n Seuthes, never intended to defraud them, and I\n will pay over the money. \n ",

But there\n joined him still others who forced themselves in, to the number of\n six hundred; and the captains tried to drive them away, so that they\n might not have to give them a share in the booty—just as though the\n property was already in hand. \n ",
                "11":"\n When they reached the place, about\n midnight, the slaves that were round about the tower and most of the\n animals ran away, the Greeks leaving them unheeded in order to\n capture Asidates himself and his belongings. \n ",
                "12":"\n And when they found themselves unable to take the tower by storm (for\n it was high and large, and furnished with battlements and a\n considerable force of warlike defenders), they attempted to dig\n through the tower-wall. \n ",
                "13":"\n Now the wall had a thickness of eight earthen bricks. At daybreak,\n however, a breach had been made; and just as soon as the light\n showed through, some one from within struck with an ox-spit clean\n through the thigh of the man who was nearest the hole; and from that\n time on they kept shooting out arrows and so made it unsafe even to\n pass by the place any more. \n ",
                "14":"\n Then, as the result of their shouting and lighting of beacon fires,\n there came to their assistance Itamenes with his own force, and from\n Comania Assyrian hoplites and Hyrcanian horsemen—these also being\n mercenaries in the service of the King—to the number of eighty, as\n well as about eight hundred peltasts, and more from Parthenium, and\n more from Apollonia and from the near-by places, including\n horsemen. \n ",
                "15":"\n Then it was time to consider how the\n retreat was to be effected; so seizing all the cattle and sheep\n there were, as well as slaves, they got them inside of a hollow\n square and proceeded to drive them along with them, not because they\n were any longer giving thought to the matter of booty, but out of\n fear that the retreat might become a rout if they should go off and\n leave their booty behind, and that the enemy might become bolder and\n the soldiers more disheartened; while as it was, they were\n withdrawing like men ready to fight for their possessions. \n ",
                "16":"\n But as soon as Gongylus saw that the Greeks were few and those who\n were attacking them many, he sallied forth himself, in spite of his\n mother, at the head of his own force, desiring to take part in the\n action; and Procles also came to the rescue, from Halisarna\n and Teuthrania, the descendant of Damaratus. \n ",
                "17":"\n And Xenophon and his men, by this time sorely distressed by the\n arrows and sling-stones, and marching in a curved line in order to\n keep their shields facing the arrows, succeeded with difficulty in\n crossing the Carcasus river, almost half of their number\n wounded. \n ",
                "18":"\n It was here that Agasias, the Stymphalian captain, was wounded,\n though he continued to fight all the time against the enemy. So they\n came out of it in safety, with about two hundred slaves and sheep\n enough for sacrificial victims. \n ",
                "19":"\n The next day Xenophon offered\n sacrifice, and then by night led forth the entire army with the\n intention of making as long a march as possible through Lydia , to the end that Asidates\n might not be fearful on account of their nearness, but be off his\n guard. \n ",
                "20":"\n Asidates, however, hearing that Xenophon had sacrificed again with a\n view to attacking him and that he was to come with the entire army,\n left his tower and encamped in villages that lay below the town of\n Parthenium. \n ",
                "21":"\n There Xenophon and his men fell in with him, and they captured him,\n his wife and children, his horses, and all that he had; and thus the\n omens of the earlier sacrifice proved true. \n ",
                "22":"\n After that they came back again to Pergamus . And there Xenophon paid his greeting to\n the god; for the Laconians, the captains, the other generals, and\n the soldiers joined in arranging matters so that he got the pick of\n horses and teams of oxen and all the rest; the result was, that he\n was now able even to do a kindness to another. \n ",
                "23":"\n Meanwhile Thibron arrived and took\n over the army, and uniting it with the rest of his Greek forces,\n proceeded to wage war upon Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus. \n ",
                "24":"\n [The governors of all the King’s territories that\n we traversed were as follows: Artimas of Lydia , Artacamas of Phrygia , Mithradates of Lycaonia and Cappadocia , Syennesis of\n Cilicia , Dernes of\n Phoenicia and\n Arabia , Belesys of\n Syria and Assyria,\n Rhoparas of Babylon ,\n Arbacas of Media, Tiribazus of the Phasians and Hesperites; then the\n Carduchians, Chalybians, Chaldaeans, Macronians, Colchians,\n Mossynoecians, Coetians, and Tibarenians, who were independent; and\n then Corylas governor of Paphlagonia , Pharnabazus of the Bithynians, and\n Seuthes of the Thracians in Europe . \n ",
                "25":"\n The length of the entire journey,\n upward and downward, was two hundred and fifteen stages, one\n thousand, one hundred and fifty parasangs, or thirty-four thousand,\n two hundred and fifty-five stadia; and the length in time, upward\n and downward, a year and three months. \n "
