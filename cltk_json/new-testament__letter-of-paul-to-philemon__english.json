            "1":"\n to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:\n ",
            "2":"\n Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\n ",
            "3":"\n I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,\n ",
            "4":"\n hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the\nLord Jesus, and toward all the saints;\n ",
            "5":"\n that the fellowship of\nyour faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing\nwhich is in us in Christ Jesus.\n ",
            "6":"\n For we have much joy and comfort\nin your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed\nthrough you, brother.\n ",
            "7":"\n Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you\nthat which is appropriate,\n ",
            "8":"\n yet for love's sake I rather beg,\nbeing such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus\nChrist.\n ",

            "12":"\n whom I desired to keep with\nme, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the gospel.\n ",
            "13":"\n But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your\ngoodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.\n ",
            "14":"\n For\nperhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would\nhave him forever,\n ",
            "15":"\n no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a\nbeloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in\nthe flesh and in the Lord.\n ",
            "16":"\n If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would\nreceive me.\n ",
            "17":"\n But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you\nanything, put that to my account.\n ",
            "18":"\n I, Paul, write this with my\nown hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me\neven your own self besides).\n ",
            "19":"\n Yes, brother, let me have joy from\nyou in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.\n ",
            "20":"\n Having confidence\nin your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond\nwhat I say.\n ",
