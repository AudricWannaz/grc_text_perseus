        "0":"Here we are, the faithful Council of the Persians, who have gone to the land of Hellas , we who serve as warders of the royal abode, rich in bountiful store of gold,",
        "1":"we whom Xerxes, our King, Darius’ royal son, himself selected, by virtue of our rank and years, to be the guardians of his realm.\n Yet as regards the return of our King and of his host, so richly decked out in gold,",
        "2":"the soul within my breast is distressed and presages disaster. For the whole populace of the Asian nation has come and murmurs against its youthful King, nor does any courier or horseman",
        "3":"arrive at the city of the Persians, who left behind them the walled defence of Susa and Agbatana and Cissa’s ancient ramparts, and went forth, some on horseback, some in galleys, others on foot",
        "4":"presenting a dense array of war.\n Such are Amistres and Artaphrenes and Megabates and Astaspes, marshals of the Persians; kings themselves, yet vassals of the Great King,",
        "5":"they press on, commanders of an enormous host, skilled in archery and horsemanship, formidable to look upon and fearful in battle through the valiant resolve of their souls. Artembares, too, who fights from his chariot,",
        "6":"and Masistres, and noble Imaeus, skilled with the bow, and Pharandaces, and Sosthanes, who urges on his steeds. Others in addition the mighty, fecund Nile sent forth — Susiscanes,",
        "7":"Pegastagon of Egyptian lineage, mighty Arsames, lord of sacred Memphis , Ariomardus, governor of ancient Thebes , and the marsh-dwelling oarsmen,",
        "8":"well-skilled and countless in number.\n ",
        "9":"Behind them follows a throng of luxurious Lydians and those who hold in subjection all the people of the mainland, whom Metrogathes and brave Arcteus, their regal commanders,",
        "10":"and Sardis rich in gold sent forth, riding in many a chariot, in ranks with three and four steeds abreast, a spectacle terrible to behold. They too who live by sacred Tmolus pledge themselves",
        "11":"to cast the yoke of slavery upon Hellas—Mardon, Tharybis, anvils of the lance, and the Mysians, hurlers of the javelin. Babylon , also, teeming with gold, sends a mixed host arrayed in a long line, both mariners borne in galleys",
        "12":"and those who rely on their skill in archery. The nation too which wears the sabre follows from every part of Asia in the fearful procession of the King.\n Such are the warriors, the flower of the Persian land,",
        "13":"who have departed, and in fierce longing for them the whole land of Asia , their foster-nurse, laments, while parents and wives, as they count the days, shudder at the lengthening delay.\n\n ",
        "14":"The royal army, dealing destruction to cities, has already passed to the neighboring land upon the facing shore, and this they did by crossing the Hellespont ,",
        "15":"named for the daughter of Athamas, on a bridge of boats made fast with cables, thereby casting a tightly constructed roadway as a yoke upon the neck of the sea.\n ",
        "16":"The fiery lord of populous Asia",
        "17":"is leading his wondrous warrior-flock against the whole earth in two divisions, on foot and by the sea, putting his trust in his stalwart and stern commanders; he himself,",
        "18":"a god-like hero whose race is sprung from gold.",
        "19":"\n With eyes flashing with the dark glare of a deadly dragon, attended by soldiers and mariners in great numbers, and speeding his Syrian chariot,",
        "20":"he leads against a people renowned for the spear a warlike host of archers.\n ",
        "21":"\n And there is no man skilled to withstand the mighty stream of men, and with strong barriers keep out the sea’s invincible surge;",
        "22":"for Persia ’s host cannot be withstood, and her men are courageous.\n ",
        "23":"\n For by the will of the gods Fate has held sway",
        "24":"since ancient time, and has ordained for the Persians the pursuit of rampart-destroying war, the turmoil of fighting horsemen, and the storming of cities.",
        "25":"And they have learned to look upon the precinct of the deep when the broad-wayed sea whitens to foam beneath the tempest’s blast, trusting in their finely wrought",
        "26":"cables and their devices which give passage to their army.\n ",
        "27":"\n Yet the insidious guile of god—what mortal man can escape it? Who with agile foot can lightly overleap",
        "28":"and escape its toils?\n ",
        "29":"\n For Delusion, with her fair appearance, lures men astray into her snares, from which it is not possible to escape without meeting with disaster.\n ",
        "30":"Therefore my heart is wrapped in gloom and is racked with fear for the Persian army lest the state learn that the mighty capital of Susa is empty of men.\n ",
        "31":"Fearful I am too that as bands of women cry aloud woe, the Cissian stronghold will raise a resounding shout responsive to the beating of breasts,",
        "32":"and that there will be a tearing of fine linen robes.\n ",
        "33":"\n For all the men-at-arms, those who urge on steeds and those who march along the plain, have left the city and gone forth, like bees in a swarm, together with the captain of the host.",
        "34":"They have crossed the headland, projecting into the sea and common to either continent, through which both shores are bridged.\n ",
        "35":"\n And marriage-beds are filled with tears through longing for husbands;",
        "36":"each Persian woman has sent to the field her warlike and fiery consort, and now in grief and longing for her beloved lord, is left forsaken by her mate.\n ",
        "37":"But come, Persians, let us take our place on the steps of this ancient palace and devise some wise and deeply-pondered counsel—for need of this has come upon us—as to how Xerxes our King,",
        "38":"Darius’ son, scion of our own race as his forefather’s name declares, is faring. Is it the drawing of the bow that has triumphed, or is it the might of the sharp spear-head which has prevailed? Enter Atossa, richly dressed, on a chariot and attended by a numerous retinue \n \n \n ",
        "39":"But look, here is a light like the eyes of the god, the mother of our king, my Queen. I bow low before her. It is fitting also that we all address her with words of salutation. The elders prostrate themselves and then rise to their feet. Their leader continues ",
        "40":"O Queen, most exalted of Persia ’s deep-girdled women, venerable mother of Xerxes, wife of Darius, all hail! You were the consort of the Persian’s god, and of another god the mother, that is, unless its former good fortune has now forsaken our host.\n ",
        "41":"\n For this very reason I have left the gold-decorated palace",
        "42":"and the chamber which belongs to Darius and myself, and have come here. My heart, too, is racked with anxiety, and to you, my friends, will I make a disclosure. For I am by no means free from apprehension that wealth, grown great, will, raising a cloud of dust upon the ground, trip up the prosperity which Darius raised not without the favor of some god.",
        "43":"It is for this reason that there is a double concern in my mind: neither to hold in honor vast wealth without men, and that the light of success does not shine, in proportion to their strength, on men without riches. Our wealth, at all events, is ample, but my anxiety is for the light, the salvation of the house, which I regard to be the presence of its lord.",
        "44":"Therefore, since things stand as they do, lend me your counsel in this concern, Persians, my aged trusty servants. For all my hopes of good counsel depend on you.\n ",
        "45":"\n Be assured, our country’s Queen, that you need not twice mention either word or deed regarding that in which it is possible for us to direct you.",
        "46":"For we whom you summon as counsellors in these matters are well disposed towards you and your interests.\n ",
        "47":"I have been haunted by a multitude of dreams at night since the time when my son, having despatched his army, departed with intent to lay waste the land of the Ionians. But never yet have I beheld so distinct a vision",
        "48":"as that of the last night. This I will describe to you.\n I dreamed that two women in beautiful clothes, one in Persian garb, the other in Dorian attire, appeared before my eyes; both far more striking in stature than are the women of our time,",
        "49":"flawless in beauty, sisters of the same family. As for the lands in which they dwelt, to one had been assigned by lot the land of Hellas , to the other that of the barbarians. The two, as I imagined it, seemed to provoke each other to a mutual feud, and my son, when he had become aware of this,",
        "50":"attempted to restrain and placate them. He yoked them both to his car and placed the collar-straps upon their necks. The one bore herself proudly in these trappings and kept her mouth obedient to the rein. The other struggled and with her hands",
        "51":"tore apart the harness of the car; then, free of the curb, she dragged it violently along with her and snapped the yoke in two. My son was hurled to the ground and his father Darius stood by his side filled with pity. But Xerxes, when he caught sight of him, tore the garments covering his body.\n ",
        "52":"Such was the vision I beheld in the night. But when I had risen and dipped my hands in the clear-flowing water of a spring, I drew near to an altar with incense in my hand, intending to make an offering of sacrificial cake to the divinities that avert evil, those to whom these rites are due.",
        "53":"But I saw an eagle fleeing for safety to the altar of Phoebus—and out of terror, my friends, I stood speechless. Thereupon I caught sight of a falcon rushing at full speed with outstretched wings and with his talons plucking at the head of the eagle, which did nothing but cower and",
        "54":"yielded its body to his foe.\n These are the terrors I beheld, terrors too for you to hear. Be assured that if my son should suceeed, he would prove to be remarkable indeed, but if he fails, he does not have to answer to the state; if he returns safely, he will hold sway in this land as he did before.\n\n ",
        "55":"Mother, we would neither alarm you unduly by our words nor raise your hopes too high. If, however, it is something inauspicious that you have seen, visit the gods with supplication and entreat them to avert the evil and to bring to pass what will be beneficial to you, your children, the kingdom, and all else that you hold dear. Next, it is appropriate that you should",
        "56":"offer libations to Earth and the dead; and use auspicious words to address your husband Darius, whom you say you have seen in the night, and ask him to send into the light of day from beneath the earth blessings for you and your son; ask too that the reverse of this may be held in bondage beneath the earth and fade away in gloom. Such is the advice I, relying on my instincts, offer you with kind intent.",
        "57":"According to our interpretation of these portents, the issue will in all respects prove prosperous to you.\n ",
        "58":"You, its first interpreter, have indeed read the meaning of my dream with goodwill, at least, toward my son and house. May the outcome then prove beneficial! When I return to the palace, I will perform for the gods and my dear ones beneath the earth all those rites which you recommend. Meanwhile, my friends, I would like to learn",
        "59":"where Athens is located.\n ",
        "60":"Far from here, to the west where the last rays of our Lord the Sun set.\n ",
        "61":"Can it then really be that my son had the keen desire to make this city his prey?\n ",
        "62":"Yes, for then all Hellas would be subject to the King.\n ",
        "63":"Does their army have such a multitude of men?\n ",
        "64":"Yes, it is an army of such magnitude that it has caused great disaster for the Medes.\n ",
        "65":"And what else have they besides? Do they have sufficient wealth in their homes?\n ",
        "66":"Of silver they possess a veritable fountain, a treasure chest in their soil.\n ",
        "67":"Is the bow-stretching arrow particularly suited to their hands?",
        "68":"Far from it; they have lances for close fight and shields that serve them for armor.\n ",
        "69":"And who is set over them as shepherd and is master of their host?\n ",
        "70":"Of no man are they called the slaves or vassals.\n ",
        "71":"How then can they withstand the attack of an invading foe?\n ",
        "72":"So well as to have destroyed Darius’ great and courageous host.\n ",
        "73":"In truth, your words have given the fathers and mothers of those who are now on their way there dire food for thought.\n ",
        "74":"No, rather I think that you will soon learn the truth of the matter. For here comes one who is beyond a doubt a Persian courier. He bears clear tidings of some issue, be it good or bad.\n ",
        "75":"O cities of all the land of Asia ,",
        "76":"O realm of Persia , and bounteous haven of wealth, at a single stroke all your plenteous prosperity has been shattered, and the flower of the Persians has fallen and perished! Ah, it is a terrible task to be the first to deliver news of disaster. And yet, Persians, I must relate the entirety of the calamity",
        "77":"—the whole barbarian host is lost.\n ",
        "78":"Grievous, grievous disaster, strange and cruel. Alas, Persians, weep now that you hear of this calamity.\n ",
        "79":"Yes, weep, for you hear that the whole army is utterly destroyed; and I myself unexpectedly behold the day of my return.\n ",
        "80":"The life which has been given to us elders is too long, for we have now heard",
        "81":"of this unexpected misery.\n ",
        "82":"Since I myself was present and did not merely hear what happened from the report of others, I can tell you exactly what kind of disaster was wrought.\n ",
        "83":"Alas, alas! In vain did our vast and variously armed host",
        "84":"go forth from the land of Asia against the hostile soil of Hellas .\n ",
        "85":"Full of the bodies of men who perished by a miserable fate are the shores of Salamis and all the neighboring coasts.\n ",
        "86":"Alas, alas! You say that the bodies of our loved ones,",
        "87":"battered by the brine and drenched, are tossing, washed back and forth among the reefs.\n ",
        "88":"Our bows were of no use, and the whole host has perished, overwhelmed when ship charged on ship.",
        "89":"Raise a doleful and mournful wail for the Persians, the wretched Persians, since they have met with complete and utter ruin. Alas for the destruction of our host!\n ",
        "90":"O name of Salamis most odious to my ears!",
        "91":"Alas, how I groan when I recall the memory of Athens !\n ",
        "92":"Ah, hateful indeed is Athens to her foes. Now must we remember how many Persian women she has deprived of sons and husbands, lost all in vain.",
        "93":"Long have I kept silent in my misery, struck with dismay at our disaster; for this calamity is so great that it is not possible to say or even to ask about its extent. Nevertheless mortals must endure affliction when it is heaven-sent.",
        "94":"Compose yourself, and even though you groan at our loss, relate the sum of our disaster and speak out! Who is there that is not dead? Whom of our leaders must we bewail? Who, appointed to wield command, by death left his post empty, without its chief?\n ",
        "95":"Xerxes himself lives and beholds the light.",
        "96":"The words you utter bring a great light of joy into my house, and bright day after night wrapped in gloom.\n ",
        "97":"But Artembares, commander of ten thousand cavalrymen, is being battered now against Silenia’s cruel shore. And Dadaces, leader of a thousand men, leapt, struck by a spear,",
        "98":" with a nimble bound from his ship. Tenagon, the true-born Bactrians’ chieftain, is ranging now around the surf-beaten isle of Ajax. Lilaeus and Arsames, and, third, Argestes,",
        "99":"kept buffeting against its rugged shore, whirled around about the island, the breeding-place of doves. Arcteus, too, who lived by the waters of the Egyptian Nile, Adeues, and Pharnuchus of the mighty shield—all these were hurled out of one ship. Matallus of Chrysa , commander of ten thousand,",
        "100":"leader of the Black Cavalry, thirty thousand strong, in death dyed red his thick and shaggy beard, changing its color with a deep crimson stain. Arabus, too, the Magian, perished there, and Bactrian Artabes, a settler now in a rugged land.",
        "101":"Amistris, and Amphistreus, wielder of a painful spear, and brave Ariomardus, whose death brought grief to Sardis , and Seisames the Mysian, and Tharybis, admiral of five times fifty ships, a Lyrnaean by descent, a man of physical beauty,",
        "102":"lies dead in a state of misery, no longer attended by good fortune. Syennesis, also, the governor of the Cilicians, foremost in courage, he whose prowess did the foe most harm, found there a glorious death. Such were the leaders about whom I was making my report.",
        "103":"Although our losses were many, I announce but few.\n ",
        "104":"Alas! The words I hear put the very crown upon our woes; a disgrace to the Persians and cause for shrill lament. But retrace your tale and tell me this clearly:",
        "105":"how great was the number of the Greek ships which gave them confidence enough to go into battle with their armed prows against the Persian army?\n ",
        "106":"If numbers had been the only factor, be assured that the barbarians would have gained the victory with their fleet. For the whole number of the ships of Hellas amounted to ten times thirty,",
        "107":"and, in addition to these, there was a chosen squadron of ten. But Xerxes, this I know, had under his command a thousand, while those excelling in speed were twice a hundred, and seven more. This is the total of their respective numbers. Do you think that we were simply outnumbered in this contest?",
        "108":"No, it was some divine power that tipped the scale of fortune with unequal weight and thus destroyed our host. The gods preserve the city of the goddess Pallas.\n ",
        "109":"Is then the city of Athens not yet despoiled?\n ",
        "110":"No, while her men still live, her ramparts are impregnable.",
        "111":"But the beginning of the encounter of the fleets, tell me about it. Who began the onset? Was it the Hellenes? Or my son, exulting in the multitude of his ships?\n ",
        "112":"My Queen, some destructive power or evil spirit, appearing from somewhere or other, caused the beginning of our utter rout.",
        "113":"A Hellene, from the Athenian host, came to your son Xerxes and told this tale: that, when the gloom of black night should set in, the Hellenes would not remain in place, but, springing upon the rowing benches of their ships, would seek, some here, some there,",
        "114":"to preserve their lives by stealthy flight. But Xerxes, when he heard this, comprehending neither the cleverness of the Greek nor that the gods grudged him success, straightway gave all his captains orders to this effect—that, when the sun had ceased to illumine the earth with his beams,",
        "115":"and darkness had covered the region of the sky, they should bring up in a tight group the main body of the fleet, disposed in triple line, to bar the exits and the sounding straits, and station other ships in a circle around the island of Ajax. He gave them a warning too that, should the Hellenes escape an evil doom,",
        "116":"finding by stealth some means of flight for their fleet, it had been decreed that every captain should lose his head. These commands he made with complete confidence of heart, since he knew not the issue intended by the gods. Our crews then, with no lack of order but with an obedient spirit,",
        "117":"prepared their evening meal, while each sailor looped his oar about its thole-pin so that it fitted well. But when the light of the sun had faded and night drew on, each master of an oar and each man versed in arms went on board.",
        "118":"The long galleys cheered each other, line by line; and they held their course as each captain had been ordered, and all through the night the commanders of the fleet kept their whole force cruising to and fro across the strait. Night began to wane,",
        "119":"yet the fleet of the Hellenes in no way attempted to put forth by stealth. When, however, radiant Day with her white horses shone over all the land, a loud cheer like a song of triumph first rang out from the Hellenes, and, at the same instant,",
        "120":"clear from the island crags, an echo returned an answering cry. Terror fell on all the barbarians, balked of their purpose; for then the Hellenes chanted their solemn paean, not as in flight, but as men rushing to the onset with the courage of gallant hearts.\n ",
        "121":"The trumpet with its blast set all their side afire, and instantly, at the word of command, with the even stroke of foaming oars they struck the briny deep. Swiftly they all came clear into view. Their right wing, well marshalled,",
        "122":"led on in orderly advance, next their whole army pressed on against us, and at the same time a loud shout met our ears: On, you men of Hellas ! Free your native land. Free your children, your wives, the temples of your fathers’ gods,and the tombs of your ancestors. Now you are fighting for all you have. Then from our side arose in response the mingled clamor of Persian speech, and straightaway the ships dashed together their bronze prows. It was a ship of Hellas \n ",
        "123":"that began the charge and chopped off in its entirety the curved stern of a Phoenician boat. Each captain drove his ship straight against some other ship. At first the stream of the Persian army held its own. When, however, the mass of our ships had been crowded in the narrows, and none could render another aid,",
        "124":"and each crashed its bronze prow against each of its own line, they splintered their whole bank of oars. Then the Hellenic galleys, not heedless of their chance, hemmed them in and battered them on every side. The hulls of our vessels rolled over, and the sea was hidden from our sight,",
        "125":"strewn as it was with wrecks and slaughtered men. The shores and reefs were crowded with our dead, and every ship that formed a part of the barbarian fleet plied its oars in disorderly flight. But, as if our men were tuna or some haul of fish,",
        "126":"the foe kept striking and hacking them with broken oars and fragments of wrecked ships. Groans and shrieks together filled the open sea until the face of black night hid the scene. But as for the the full extent of our disasters, this, even if I had ten days in succession to do so, I could not describe to you.",
        "127":"However, you can be sure that so great a multitude of men never perished in a single day.\n\n ",
        "128":"Alas! In truth a vast sea of troubles has burst upon the Persians and the entire barbarian race.",
        "129":"Be assured of this, not even half of the disaster has as yet been told. A calamity so dreadful as to outweigh these ills twice over befell them.\n ",
        "130":"But what greater misfortune than this could have befallen them? Speak! What is this other disaster you say",
        "131":"came upon our force, sinking the scale to greater weight of ill?\n ",
        "132":"Those Persians who were in their life’s prime, bravest in spirit, pre-eminent for noble birth, and always among the foremost in loyalty to the King himself— these have fallen ignobly by a most inglorious doom.",
        "133":"Ah, I am truly reduced to misery through this disaster! By what fate was it that you say they met their end?\n ",
        "134":"There is an island lying before Salamis , a small one and dangerous anchorage for ships; its sea-washed shore is the haunt of Pan, who loves the dance.",
        "135":"There Xerxes dispatched these, his choicest troops, in order that when the Hellenic enemy, wrecked from their ships, should flee in search of safety to the island, they might slaughter their force, an easy prey, and rescue their comrades from the straits of the sea. Grievously did he misjudge the issue. For when some god",
        "136":"had given the glory to the Hellenes in the battle on the sea, on that same day, fencing their bodies in armor of bronze, they leapt from their ships and encircled the whole island, so that our men were at a loss which way to turn. Often they were struck by stones slung from their hands,",
        "137":"and arrows sped from the bow-string kept falling upon them and doing them harm. At last the Hellenes, charging with one shout, struck them and hacked to pieces the limbs of the poor wretches, until they had utterly quenched the life of all.",
        "138":"Xerxes groaned aloud when he beheld the extent of the disaster, for he occupied a seat commanding a clear view of the entire army—a lofty headland by the open sea. Tearing his robes and uttering a loud cry, he straightaway gave orders to his force on land",
        "139":"and dismissed them in disorderly flight. This, besides the one already told, is the disaster you must bewail.\n ",
        "140":"O hateful divinity, how have you foiled the purpose of the Persians! Cruel was the vengeance which my son brought upon himself for his designs against illustrious Athens ; the barbarians",
        "141":"whom Marathon destroyed were not enough. It was in an effort to exact retribution for them that my son has drawn upon himself so great a multitude of woes. But the ships that escaped destruction—tell me about them. Where did you leave them? Can you give a clear report?\n ",
        "142":"The commanders of the ships which still remained fled with a rush in disorder wherever the wind bore them. As for the survivors of the army, they perished in Boeotian territory, some, faint from thirst, beside a refreshing spring, while some of us, exhausted and panting,",
        "143":"made our way to the land of the Phocians, to Doris and the Melian gulf, where the Spercheus waters the plain with kindly stream. Coming from there, badly in need of food, we received welcome in the Achaean land and the cities of the Thessalians.",
        "144":"There it was that many perished of thirst and hunger, for we were oppressed by both. And we came to the Magnesian land and to the country of the Macedonians, to the ford of the Axius and Bolbe’s reedy marsh, and to Mount Pangaeus,",
        "145":"in the Edonian land. But on that night the god roused winter before its time and froze the stream of sacred Strymon from shore to shore. Many a man who before that had held the gods in no esteem, implored them then in supplication, doing obeisance to earth and heaven.",
        "146":"But when our host had made an end of its fervent invocation of the gods, it ventured to pass across the ice-bound stream. And each of us who started on his way before the sun god dispersed his beams, found himself in safety, for the bright orb of the sun with its burning rays",
        "147":"heated the middle section and pierced it with its flames. One after another our men sank in, and fortunate indeed was he who perished soonest. The survivors, after making their way through Thrace with great hardship,",
        "148":"—and few they were indeed—escaped to the safety of the land of their homes; now the city of the Persians may make lament in regret for the beloved youth of the land. What I say is true, yet much remains untold of the ills launched by Heaven upon the Persians. Exit \n \n ",
        "149":"O unearthly power, source of our cruel distress, with what crushing weight have you fallen upon the whole Persian race!\n ",
        "150":"How the utter destruction of our host distresses me! O vivid vision of my dreams at night, how clearly did you signify misfortune to me!",
        "151":"And all too lightly did you in turn interpret it. However, since your explanation determined thus, first of all I wish to offer prayers to the gods, and then I will return after I have brought from the palace a sacrificial cake as a gift to Earth and the dead.",
