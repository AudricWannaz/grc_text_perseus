This set me thinking whether by any means the citizens might\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobtain food entirely from their own soil, which would certainly be the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfairest way. I felt that, were this so, they would be relieved of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoverty, and also of the suspicion with which they are regarded by the Greek\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworld. \n\t\t\t\t",

Well, if anyone feels doubtful about that, let\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim comfort himself with the thought that many men in the business will hire\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe state slaves as additional hands, since they have abundance of capital,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that among those now working in the mines many are growing old. Moreover\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere are many others, both Athenians and foreigners, who have neither will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnor strength to work with their own hands, but would be glad to to make a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliving by becoming managers. \n\t\t\t\t",

Further, if each man brings in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclear obol a day, the annual revenue derived from that number of men is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsixty talents. \n\t\t\t\t",

And\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is another proof. During the history of the mines an infinite number\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof men has worked in them; and yet the condition of the mines to-day is\n\t\t\t\t\t\texactly the same as it was in the time of our ancestors, and their memory\n\t\t\t\t\t\tran not to the contrary. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "25":"\n\t\t\t\t\t And present conditions all lead to the conclusion that the number of slaves\n\t\t\t\t\t\temployed there can never be greater than the works need. For the miners find\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno limit to shaft or gallery. \n\t\t\t\t",

            "27":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Then why, it may be asked, are fewer new\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcuttings made nowadays than formerly? Simply because those interested in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmines are poorer. For operations have only lately been resumed, and a man\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho makes a new cutting incurs a serious risk. If he strikes good stuff he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmakes a fortune; but if he is \n\t\t\t\t",

The Athenians, of course, are divided into ten\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribes. Now assume that the state were to offer each tribe an equal number\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof slaves, and that when new cuttings were made, the tribes were to pool\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir luck. \n\t\t\t\t",

            "31":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Of course, private individuals also are able to combine on this principle and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpool their fortunes in order to diminish the risk. Nevertheless there is no\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason to fear that a public company formed on this plan will conflict with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe interests of private persons, or be hampered by them. No, just as every\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew adhesion to a confederacy brings an increase of strength to all its\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers, so the greater the number of persons operating in the mines, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore treasure they will discover and unearth. \n\t\t\t\t",

            "33":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Some may imagine that enough money would never be subscribed to provide the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thuge amount of capital necessary, according to their calculations, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinance all these schemes. But even so they need not despair. \n\t\t\t\t",

No, whatever the number\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof houses built, or of ships constructed, or of slaves purchased, they will\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately prove a paying concern. \n\t\t\t\t",
            "35":"\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact in one respect it will be even more profitable to proceed gradually\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan to do everything at once.

            "39":"\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly I hold that this, which is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasiest way, is also the best way of doing these things. On the other hand,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif you think that the burdens imposed during the late war make it impossible for you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto contribute anything at allâ€”well, keep down the cost of administration\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring the next year to the amount that the taxes yielded before the peace;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand invest the balances over and above that amount, which you will get with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeace, with considerate treatment of resident aliens and merchants, with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth of imports and exports due to concentration of a larger population,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand with the expansion of harbour and market dues, so that the investment\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill bring in the largest revenue. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t",

The distance between Megara,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe nearest city, and the silver mines, is of course much more than five\n\t\t\t\t\t\thundred furlongs; and Thebes, which is next in proximity, lies at a distance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof much more than six hundred furlongs from them. \n\t\t\t\t",

On the other hand, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarch on them with a large force, leaving his own property unprotected, is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno easy matter; for when he arrived at the mines the city of Athens would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch nearer to his own states than he himself would be. \n\t\t\t\t",
