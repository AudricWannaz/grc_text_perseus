            "0":"\n I know how difficult it is to write an\n appreciation of Agesilaus that shall be worthy of his virtue and glory.\n Nevertheless the attempt must be made. For it would not be seemly that so\n good a man, just because of his perfection, should receive no tributes of\n praise, however inadequate. \n ",
            "1":"\n Now concerning his high birth what greater and\n nobler could be said than this, that even to-day the line of his descent\n from Heracles \n is traced through the roll of his ancestors, and those no simple citizens,\n but kings and sons of kings? \n ",
            "2":"\n Nor are they open to the reproach that though they were kings, they ruled\n over a petty state. On the contrary, as their family is honoured above all\n in their fatherland, so is their state glorious above all in Greece ; thus they are not first in the\n second rank, but leaders in a community of leaders. \n ",
            "3":"\n On one account his fatherland and his family are worthy to be praised\n together, for never at any time has the state been moved by jealousy of\n their pre-eminence to attempt the overthrow of their government, and never\n at any time have the kings striven to obtain greater powers than were\n conferred on them originally at their succession to the throne. For this\n reason, while no other government — democracy, oligachy, despotism or\n kingdom — can can lay claim to an unbroken existence, this kingdom alone\n stands fast continually. \n ",
            "4":"\n However, there are not wanting signs that even\n before his reign began Agesilaus was deemed worthy to be king. For on the\n death of King Agis there was a struggle for the throne between Leotychidas,\n as the son of Agis, and Agesilaus, as the son of Archidamus. The state\n decided in favour of Agesilaus, judging him to be the more eligible in point\n of birth and character alike. Surely to have been pronounced worthy of the\n highest privilege by the best men in the mightiest state is proof sufficient\n of his virtue, at least before he began to reign. \n ",
            "5":"\n I will now give an account of the achievements\n of his reign, for I believe that his deeds will throw the clearest light on\n his qualities.\n Now Agesilaus was still a young man when he gained the throne. He had been but a short\n time in power when the news leaked out that the king of the Persians was\n assembling a great navy and army for an attack on the Greeks. \n ",
            "6":"\n While the Lacedaemonians and their allies were considering the matter,\n Agesilaus declared, that if they would give him thirty Spartans, two\n thousand newly enrolled citizens, and a contingent of six thousand allies,\n he would cross to Asia and try to\n effect a peace, or, in case the barbarian wanted to fight, would keep him so\n busy that he would have no time for an attack on the Greeks. \n ",
            "7":"\n His eagerness to pay back the Persian in his own coin for the former invasion\n of Greece , his determination to\n wage an offensive rather than a defensive war, and his wish to make the\n enemy pay for it rather than the Greeks, were enough to arouse an immediate\n and widespread enthusiasm for his project. But what appealed most to the\n imagination was the idea of entering on a struggle not to save Greece , but to subdue Asia . \n ",
            "8":"\n And what of his strategy after he had received\n the army and had sailed out? A simple narrative of his actions will\n assuredly convey the clearest impression of it. \n ",
            "9":"\n This, then, was his first act in Asia . Tissaphernes had sworn the following oath to\n Agesilaus: If you will arrange an armistice to last until the return of the\n messengers whom I will send to the King, I will do my utmost to obtain\n independence for the Greek cities in Asia ; and Agesilaus on his part had sworn to observe the\n armistice honestly, allowing three months for the transaction. What\n followed? \n ",
            "10":"\n Tissaphernes forthwith broke his oath, and instead of arranging a peace,\n applied to the King for a large army in addition to that which he had\n before. As for Agesilaus, though well aware of this, he none the less\n continued to keep the armistice. \n ",
            "11":"\n I think, therefore, that here we have his first noble achievement. By showing\n up Tissaphernes as a perjurer, he made him distrusted everywhere; and,\n contrariwise, by proving himself to be a man of his word and true to his\n agreements, he encouraged all, Greeks and barbarians alike, to enter into an\n agreement with him whenever he wished it. \n ",
            "12":"\n The arrival of the new army emboldened\n Tissaphernes to send an ultimatum to Agesilaus, threatening was unless\n he withdrew from Asia ; and the\n allies and the Lacedaemonians present made no concealment of their\n chagrin, believing that the strength of Agesilaus was weaker than the\n Persian king’s armament. But Agesilaus with a beaming face bade the\n envoys of Tissaphernes inform their master that he was profoundly\n grateful to him for his perjury, by which he had gained the hostility of\n the gods for himself and had made them allies of the Greeks. \n ",
            "13":"\n Without a moment’s delay he gave the word to his troops to pack up in\n preparation for a campaign, and warned the cities that lay on the lines\n of march to Caria to have their\n markets ready stocked. He advised by letter the Greeks of Ionia , the Aeolid and the Hellespont , to send their contingents\n for the campaign to his headquarters at Ephesus . \n ",
            "14":"\n Now Tissaphernes reflected that Agesilaus was\n without cavalry, while Caria was a\n difficult country for mounted men, and he thought that Agesilaus was wroth\n with him on account of his deceit. Concluding, therefore, that his estate in\n Caria was the real object of\n the coming attack, he sent the whole of his infantry across to that district\n and took his cavalry round into the plain of the Maeander , confident that he could ride\n down the Greeks before they reached the country where cavalry could not\n operate. \n ",
            "15":"\n But instead of marching on Caria ,\n Agesilaus forthwith turned round and made for Phrygia . Picking up the various forces that met him on the\n route, he proceeded to reduce the cities and captured a vast quantity of\n booty by sudden attacks. \n ",
            "16":"\n This achievement also was thought to be a\n proof of sound generalship, that when war was declared and cozening in\n consequence became righteous and fair dealing, he showed Tissaphernes to be\n a child at deception. It was thought, too, that he made shrewd use of this\n occasion to enrich his friends. \n ",
            "17":"\n For the accumulation of plunder was so great that things were selling for\n next to nothing. So he gave his friends the word to buy, saying that he was\n shortly going down to the coast with his army. The\n auctioneers were ordered to have a schedule made of the prices obtained and\n to give delivery of the goods. Thus without capital outlay, and without any\n loss to the treasury, all his friends made a prodigious amount of money.\n \n ",
            "18":"\n Further, whenever deserters offered to give information where plunder might\n be taken, they naturally went to the king. In such a case he took care that\n the capture should be effected by his friends, so that they might at one and\n the same time make money and add to their laurels. The immediate result was\n that he had many ardent suitors for his friendship. \n ",
            "19":"\n Recognizing that a country plundered and\n depopulated could not long support an army, whereas an inhabited and\n cultivated land would yield inexhaustible supplies, he took pains not only\n to crush his enemies by force, but also to win them over by gentleness. \n ",
            "20":"\n He would often warn his men not to punish their prisoners as criminals, but\n to guard them as human beings; and often when shifting camp, if he noticed\n little children, the property of merchants, left behind — many merchants\n offered children for sale because they thought they would not be able to\n carry and feed them — he looked after them too, and had them conveyed to\n some place of refuge. \n ",
            "21":"\n Again, he arranged that prisoners of war who were too old to accompany the\n army were to be looked after, that they might not fall a prey to dogs or\n wolves. It thus came about that he won the goodwill not only of those who\n heard of these facts, but even of the prisoners themselves. In his\n settlement with the cities that he won over, he invariably excused them from\n all servile duties and required only such obedience as freemen owe to their\n rules; and by his clemency he made himself master of fortresses impregnable\n to assault. \n ",
            "22":"\n However, since a campaign in the plains was\n impossible even in Phrygia ,\n owing to Pharnabazus’ cavalry, he decided that he must raise a mounted\n force, if he was to avoid continually running away from the enemy. He\n therefore enrolled the wealthiest men in all the cities thereabouts as\n breeders of horses, and issued a proclamation that \n ",
            "23":"\n anyone who supplied a horse and arms and an efficient man should be exempt\n from personal service. In this way he brought it about that every one of\n them carried out these requirements with the zeal of a man in quest of\n someone to die in his stead. He also specified cities that were to furnish\n contingents of cavalry, feeling sure that from the horsebreeding cities\n riders proud of their horsemanship would be forthcoming. This again was\n considered an admirable stroke on his part, that no sooner had he raised his\n cavalry than it became a powerful body ready for action. \n ",
            "24":"\n At the first sign of spring he collected\n the whole of his forces at Ephesus . With a view to their training he offered prizes\n for the cavalry squadron that rode best, and for the company of heavy\n infantry that reached the highest level of physical fitness. He also offered\n prizes to the targeteers and the archers who showed the greatest efficiency\n in their particular duties. Thereupon one might see every gymnasium crowded\n with the men exercising, the racecourse thronged with cavalrymen riding, and\n the javelin-men and archers shooting at the mark. \n ",
            "25":"\n Indeed he made the whole city in which he was quartered a sight to see. For\n the market was full of arms and horses of all sorts on sale, and the\n coppersmiths, carpenters, workers in iron, cobblers, and painters were all\n busy making weapons of war, so that you might have thought that the city was\n really a war factory. \n ",
            "26":"\n And an inspiring sight it would have been to watch Agesilaus and all his\n soldiers behind him returning garlanded from the gymnasium and dedicating\n their garlands to Artemis. For where men reverence the gods, train\n themselves in warfare and practise obedience, there you surely find high\n hopes abounding. \n ",
            "27":"\n Moreover, believing that contempt for the enemy would kindle the fighting\n spirit, he gave instructions to his heralds that the barbarians captured in\n the raids should be exposed for sale naked. So when his soldiers saw them\n white because they never stripped, and fat and lazy through constant riding\n in carriages, they believed that the war would be exactly like fighting with\n women.\n He also gave notice to the troops that he\n would immediately lead them by the shortest route to the most fertile parts\n of the country, so that he might at once find them preparing themselves in\n body and mind for the coming struggle. \n ",
            "28":"\n Tissaphernes, however, believed that in saying this he meant to deceive him\n again, and that now he would really invade Caria . Accordingly he sent his infantry across into\n Caria as before, and stationed\n his cavalry in the plain of the Maeander . But Agesilaus did not play false: in accordance\n with his notice he marched straight to the neighbourhood of Sardis ; and for three days his route\n lay through a country bare of enemies, so that he supplied his army with\n abundance of provisions. \n ",
            "29":"\n On the fourth day the enemy’s cavalry came up. Their leader told the officer\n in command of the baggage-train to cross the river Pactolus and encamp.\n The cavalry, meantime, catching sight of the Greek camp-followers\n plundering in scattered bands, killed a large number of them. On\n noticing this, Agesilaus ordered his cavalry to go to their help. The\n Persians in turn, seeing the supports coming, gathered in a mass and\n confronted them with the full strength of their horse. \n ",
            "30":"\n Then Agesilaus, realising that the enemy’s infantry was not yet up, while he\n had all his resources on the spot, thought the moment was come to join\n battle if he could. Therefore, after offering sacrifice, he led forward\n the battle line immediately against the opposing cavalry, the heavy\n infantrymen of ten years service having orders to run to close quarters\n with the enemy, while the targeteers were to lead the advance at the\n double. He also sent word to the cavalry to attack in the knowledge that\n he himself was following with the whole army. \n ",
            "31":"\n The charge of the cavalry was met by the flower of the Persians: but as soon\n as the full weight of the attack fell on them, they swayed, and some were\n cut down immediately in the river, while the rest fled. The Greeks followed\n up their success and captured their camp. The targeteers naturally fell to\n pillaging; but Agesilaus drew the lines of his camp round so as to enclose\n the property of all, friends and foes alike. \n \n ",
            "32":"\n On hearing that there was confusion among the\n enemy, because everyone put the blame for what had happened on his\n neighbour, he advanced forthwith on Sardis . There he began burning and pillaging the suburbs,\n and meantime issued a proclamation calling on those who wanted freedom to\n join his standard, and challenging any who claimed a right to Asia to seek a decision between themselves\n and the liberators by an appeal to arms. \n ",
            "33":"\n As no one came out to oppose him, he prosecuted the campaign henceforward in\n complete confidence: he beheld the Greeks, compelled erstwhile to\n cringe, now honoured by their oppressors; caused those who arrogantly\n claimed for themselves the honours paid to the gods to shrink even from\n looking the Greeks in the face; rendered the country of his friends\n inviolate, and stripped the enemy’s country so thoroughly that in two\n years he consecrated to the god at Delphi more than two hundred talents as tithe. \n ",
            "34":"\n But the Persian king, believing that\n Tissaphernes was responsible for the bad turn in his affairs, sent down\n Tithraustes and beheaded Tissaphernes. After this the outlook became still\n more hopeless for the barbarians, while Agesilaus received large accessions\n of strength. For all the nations of the empire sent embassies seeking his\n friendship, and the desire for freedom caused many to revolt to him, so that\n not Greeks alone, but many barbarians also now acknowledged the leadership\n of Agesilaus. \n ",
            "35":"\n His conduct at this juncture also merits\n unstinted admiration. Though ruler of countless cities on the mainland,\n and master of islands — for the state had now added the fleet to his\n command — becoming daily more famous and more powerful; placed in a\n position to make what use he would of his many opportunities; and\n designing and expecting to crown his achievements by dissolving the\n empire that had attacked Greece \n in the past: he suppressed all thought of these things, and as soon as\n he received a request from the home government to come to the aid of his\n fatherland, he obeyed the call of the state, just as though he were\n standing in the Ephor’s palace alone before the Five, thus showing clearly that\n he would not take the whole earth in exchange for his fatherland, nor\n new-found friends for old, and that he scorned to choose base and secure\n gains rather than that which was right and honourable, even though it\n was dangerous. \n ",
            "36":"\n Throughout the time that he remained in his\n command, another achievement of his showed beyond question how admirable was\n his skill in kingcraft. Having found all the cities that he had gone out to\n govern rent by faction in consequence of the political disturbances that\n followed on the collapse of the Athenian empire, he brought it about by the\n influence of his presence that the communities lived in unbroken harmony and\n prosperity without recourse to banishment or executions. \n ",
            "37":"\n Therefore the Greeks in Asia mourned\n his departure as though they were bidding farewell not merely to a ruler,\n but to a father or a comrade. And at the end they showed that their\n affection was unfeigned. At any rate they went with him voluntarily to aid\n Sparta , knowing as they did\n that they must meet an enemy not inferior to themselves. This then was the\n end of his activities in Asia . \n "
        },
        "1":{
            "0":"\n After crossing the Hellespont , he passed through the very\n same tribes as the Persian king with his mighty host; and the distance that\n had been traversed by the barbarian in a year was covered by Agesilaus in\n less than a month. For he had no intention of arriving too late to aid his\n fatherland. \n ",
            "1":"\n When he had passed through Macedonia \n and reached Thessaly , the people of\n Larisa , Crannon,\n Scotussa and Pharsalus, who were allies of the Boeotians, all the\n Thessalians, in fact, except those who happened to be in exile at the time,\n followed at his heels and kept molesting him. For a time he led the army in\n a hollow square, with one half of the cavalry in front and the other half in\n the rear; but finding his progress hampered by Thessalian attacks on his\n rearguard, he sent round all the cavalry from the vanguard to the rear,\n except his own escort. \n ",
            "2":"\n When the two forces faced one another in line of battle, the Thessalians,\n believing it inexpedient to engage heavy infantry with cavalry, wheeled\n round and slowly retired, their enemy following very cautiously. Agesilaus,\n noticing the errors into which both sides were falling, now sent round his\n own escort of stalwart horsemen, with orders to bid the others to charge at\n full speed, and to do the same themselves, and not to give the enemy a\n chance of rallying. As for the Thessalians, on seeing the unexpected charge\n they either did not rally at all, or were captured in the attempt to do so\n with their horses broadside to the enemy. \n ",
            "3":"\n Polycharmus the Pharsalian, commander of the cavalry, did indeed turn, and\n fell fighting along with those about him. Hereupon ensued a wild flight, so\n that some of the enemy were killed and some were taken prisoners: at any\n rate they never halted until they reached Mt. Narthacium. \n ",
            "4":"\n On that day Agesilaus set up a trophy between Pras and Narthacium, and here\n for the moment he paused, mightily pleased with his exploit, since he had\n defeated an enemy inordinately proud of his horsemanship with the cavalry\n that he had himself created.\n On the morrow he crossed the Achaean mountains\n in Phthia , and now his route led\n him through friendly country till he reached the borders of Boeotia . \n ",
            "5":"\n Here he found arrayed against him the Thebans, Athenians, Argives,\n Corinthians, Aenianians, Euboeans, and both the Locrian tribes. Without\n a moment’s delay, in full view of the enemy, he drew up his army for\n battle. In addition to the army that he had brought with him he had a\n regiment and a half of Lacedaemonians, and of the local allies only the\n Phocians and Orchomenians. \n ",
            "6":"\n Now I am not going to say that his forces were far inferior in numbers and in\n quality, and that nevertheless he accepted battle. That statement, I\n think, would but show a want of common sense in Agesilaus and my own\n folly in praising a leader who wantonly jeopardised interests of vital\n moment. On the contrary — and this is what I do admire him for — he\n brought into the field an army not a whit inferior to the enemy’s; he so\n armed it that it looked one solid mass of bronze and scarlet; he took\n care to render his men \n ",
            "7":"\n capable of meeting all calls on their endurance; he filled their hearts with\n confidence that they were able to withstand any and every enemy; he inspired\n them all with an eager determination to out-do one another in valour; and\n lastly he filled all with anticipation that many good things would befall\n them, if only they proved good men. For he believed that men so prepared\n fight with all their might; nor in point of fact did he deceive himself.\n \n ",
            "8":"\n I will describe the battle, for there has been\n none like it in our time. The two armies met in the plain of Coronea , Agesilaus advancing from the\n Cephisus, the Thebans and their allies from Helicon. Their eyes told them\n that the opposing lines of battle were exactly matched in strength, and the\n number of cavalry on both sides was about the same. Agesilaus was on the\n right wing of his army and had the Orchomenians on his extreme left. On the\n other side the Thebans themselves were on the right wing and the Argives\n held the left. \n ",
            "9":"\n As they approached both sides for a time maintained complete silence, but\n when they were about a furlong apart, the Thebans raised the battle-cry and\n rushed forward at the double. The distance between them was still about one\n hundred yards when the mercenary troops under Herippidas, consisting of the\n \n ",
            "10":"\n men who had gone with Agesilaus from home and some of the Cyreians, dashed\n out in turn from their main body, closely followed by Ionians, Aeolians and\n Hellespontines. All these took part in the dash, and coming within\n spear-thrust put to flight the force in front of them. As for the Argives,\n they fled towards Helicon without awaiting the attack of Agesilaus. And now\n some of the mercenaries were in the act of crowning Agesilaus with a wreath,\n when a man reported to him that the Thebans had cut their way through the\n Orchomenians and were among the baggage train. So he immediately wheeled his\n main body and advanced against them; and the Thebans in their turn, seeing\n that their allies had sought refuge at the foot of Mt. Helicon, and wanting\n to break through and join their friends, made a strong move forward. \n ",
            "11":"\n At this juncture one may say without fear of\n contradiction that Agesilaus showed courage; but the course that he adopted\n was not the safest. For he might have allowed the men who were trying to\n break through to pass, and then have followed them and annihilated those in\n the rear. Instead of doing that he made a furious frontal attack on the\n Thebans. Thrusting shield against shield, they shoved and fought and killed\n and fell. There was no shouting, nor was there silence, but the strange\n noise that wrath and battle together will produce. In the end some of the\n Thebans broke through and reached Helicon, but many fell during the retreat.\n \n ",
            "12":"\n The victory lay with Agesilaus; but he himself\n had been carried wounded to his battle-line, when some horsemen rode up, and\n told him that eighty of the enemy retaining their arms had taken cover in\n the temple, and they asked what they should do. Though wounded in every part\n of his body with every sort of weapon, he did not forget his duty towards\n the gods, but gave orders that these men should be suffered to go\n whithersoever they wished, and would not suffer them to be harmed, and\n charged his escort of cavalry to conduct them to a place of safety. \n ",
            "13":"\n Now that the fighting was at an end, a weird\n spectacle met the eye, as one surveyed the scene of the conflict — the earth\n stained with blood, friend and foe lying dead side by side, shields smashed\n to pieces, spears snapped in two, daggers bared of their sheaths, some on\n the ground, some embedded in the bodies, some yet gripped by the hand. \n ",
            "14":"\n Then, as the day was far spent, having dragged the enemy’s dead within their battle line,\n they supped and slept. Early next morning Agesilaus ordered Gylis, the\n polemarch, to draw up the army in battle order and to set up a trophy,\n and to command every man to wear a wreath in honour of the god and all the flute-players\n to play. \n ",
            "15":"\n Now while they were carrying out these orders\n the Thebans sent a herald, asking leave to bury their dead under protection\n of a truce. And so a truce was made, and Agesilaus left for home, choosing,\n instead of supreme power in Asia ,\n to rule and to be ruled at home according to the constitution. \n ",
            "16":"\n Some time afterwards, finding that the Argives\n were enjoying the fruits of their land, that they had appropriated\n Corinth and were finding\n the war a pleasant occupation, he made an expedition against them. He first\n laid waste all their territory, then crossed to Corinth by the pass and captured the walls leading to\n Lechaeum. Having thus unbarred the gates of Peloponnese , he returned home for the festival of\n Hyacinthus and joined in singing the paean in\n honour of the god, taking the place assigned to him\n by the choirmaster. \n ",
            "17":"\n After a time, discovering that the Corinthians\n were keeping all their cattle safe in Peiraeum , and sowing and reaping the crops throughout that\n district, and — what he thought most serious — that the Boeotians were\n finding this route convenient for sending support to the Corinthians, with\n Creusis as their base, he marched against Peiraeum . Seeing that it was strongly guarded, he moved his\n camp after the morning meal to a position before the capital, as though the\n city was about to surrender. \n ",
            "18":"\n But becoming aware that supports had been hurriedly poured into the city\n during the night from Peiraeum , he turned about at daybreak and captured\n Peiraeum , finding it\n undefended, and everything in it, along with the fortresses that stood\n there, fell into his hands. Having done this, he returned home. \n ",
            "19":"\n After these events, the Achaeans, who were\n zealous advocates of the alliance, begged him to join them in an expedition\n against Acarnania . And when the\n Acarnanians attacked him in a mountain pass he seized the heights above\n their heads with his light infantry, fought\n an engagement and, after inflicting severe losses on them, set up a trophy;\n nor did he cease until he had induced the Acarnanians, Aetolians and Argives\n to enter into friendship with the Achaeans and alliance with himself. \n ",
            "20":"\n \n When the enemy sent embassies desiring peace,\n Agesilaus opposed the peace until he forced Corinth and Thebes to restore to their homes the citizens who had been\n exiled on account of their sympathy with the\n Lacedaemonians. And again later, having led an expedition in person against\n Phleius, he also restored the Phleiasian exiles who had suffered in the same\n cause. Possibly some may censure these actions on other grounds, but at\n least it is obvious that they were prompted by a spirit of true comradeship.\n \n ",
            "21":"\n It was in the same spirit that he subsequently \n made an expedition against Thebes , to relieve the Lacedaemonians in that city when\n their opponents had taken to murdering them. Finding the city protected on\n all sides by a trench and stockade, he crossed the Pass of Cynoscephalae , and laid waste the country\n up to the city walls, offering battle to the Thebans both on the plain and\n on the hills, if they chose to fight. In the following year he made another\n expedition against Thebes , and,\n after crossing the stockade and trenches at Scolus, laid waste the rest of\n Boeotia . \n ",
            "22":"\n Up to this time he and his city enjoyed\n unbroken success; and though the following years brought a series of\n troubles, it cannot be said that they were incurred under the leadership of\n Agesilaus. On the other hand, after the disaster at Leuctra, when his\n adversaries in league with the Mantineans were murdering his friends and\n acquaintances in Tegea , and a\n coalition of all Boeotia ,\n Arcadia and Elis had been formed,\n he took the field with the Lacedaemonian forces only, thus disappointing the\n general expectation that the Lacedaemonians would not even go outside their\n own borders for a long time to come. It was not until he had laid waste the\n country of those who had murdered his friends that he returned home once\n more. \n ",
            "23":"\n After this Sparta was attacked by all the Arcadians, Argives, Eleians\n and Boeotians, who had the support of the Phocians, both the Locrian\n peoples, the Thessalians, Aenianians, Acarnanians and Euboeans.

Accordingly, having\n decided which of them showed the stronger signs of being a friend to the\n Greeks, he took the field with him. He inflicted a crushing defeat on the\n enemy of the Greeks, and helped to establish his rival; and so having made\n him the friend of Sparta , and\n having received a great sum of money in addition,\n he sailed home, though it was mid-winter, with all haste, in order that the\n state might be in a position to take action against her enemies in the\n coming summer. \n "

            "4":"\n The praise of those who were prepared to\n censure faults they disapproved was pleasing to him, and he never resented\n candour, but avoided dissimulation like a snare.\n Slanderers he hated more than thieves, deeming\n loss of friends graver than loss of money. \n ",
            "5":"\n The mistakes of private persons he judged leniently, because few interests\n suffer by their incompetence; but the errors of rulers he treated as\n serious, since they lead to many troubles.\n Kingship, he held, demands not indolence, but\n manly virtue. \n ",
            "6":"\n He would not allow a statue of himself to be\n set up, though many wanted to give him one, but on memorials of his mind\n he laboured unceasingly, thinking the one to be the sculptor’s work, the\n other his own, the one appropriate to the rich, the other to the good. \n ",
            "7":"\n In the use of money he was not only just but\n generous, thinking that a just man may be content to leave other men’s\n money alone, but the generous man is required also to spend his own in\n the service of others. He was ever\n god-fearing, believing that they who are living life well are not yet\n happy, but only they who have died gloriously are blessed. \n ",
            "8":"\n He held it a greater calamity to neglect that\n which is good knowingly than in ignorance.\n No fame attracted him unless he did the right\n work to achieve it.\n He seemed to me one of the few men who count\n virtue not a task to be endured but a comfort to be enjoyed. At any rate\n praise gave him more pleasure than money.\n Courage, as he displayed it, was joined with\n prudence rather than boldness, and wisdom he cultivated more by action than\n in words. \n ",
            "9":"\n Very gentle with friends, he was very\n formidable to enemies; and while he resisted fatigue obstinately, he yielded\n most readily to a comrade, though fair deeds appealed more to his heart than\n fair faces.\n To moderation in times of prosperity he added\n confidence in the midst of danger. \n ",
            "10":"\n His urbanity found its habitual expression not\n in jokes but in his manner; and when on his dignity, he was never arrogant,\n but always reasonable; at least, if he showed his contempt for the haughty,\n he was humbler than the average man. For he prided himself on the simplicity\n of his own dress and the splendid equipment of his army, on a strict\n limitation of his own needs and a boundless generosity to his friends. \n ",
            "11":"\n Added to this, he was the bitterest of adversaries, but the mildest of\n conquerors; wary with enemies, but very compliant to friends.\n While ever ensuring security to his own side,\n he ever made it his business to bring to nought the designs of his enemy.\n \n ",
            "12":"\n By his relatives he was described as devoted\n to his family, by his intimates as an unfailing friend, by those who served him as unforgetful, by the\n oppressed as a champion, by his comrades in danger as a saviour second to\n the gods. \n In one respect, I think, he was unique. \n ",
            "13":"\n He proved that, though the bodily strength decays, the vigour of good men’s\n souls is ageless. At any rate, he never wearied in the pursuit of great\n and noble glory so long as his body could support the vigour of his\n soul. \n ",
            "14":"\n What man’s youth, then, did not seem weaker than his old age? For who in his\n prime was so formidable to his foes as Agesilaus at the very limit of\n human life? Whose removal brought such welcome relief to the enemy as\n the death of Agesilaus, despite his years? Who gave such confidence to\n allies as Agesilaus, though now on the threshold of death? What young\n man was more regretted by his friends than Agesilaus, though he died\n full of years? \n ",
            "15":"\n So complete was the record of his service to his fatherland that it did not\n end even when he died: he was still a bountiful benefactor of the state when\n he was brought home to be laid in his eternal resting-place, and, having\n raised up monuments of his virtue throughout the world, was buried with\n royal ceremony in his own land. \n "
