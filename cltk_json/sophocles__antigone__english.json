        "0":"Ismene, my sister, true child of my own mother, do you know any evil out\n of all the evils bequeathed by Oedipus that Zeus will not fulfil for the\n two of us in our lifetime? There is nothing—no pain, no ruin,",
        "1":"no shame, nor dishonor—that I have not\n seen in your sufferings and mine. And now what is this new edict that\n they say the general has just decreed to all the city? Do you know\n anything? Have you heard? Or does it escape you that ",
        "2":"evils from our enemies are on the march against\n our friends?",
        "3":"To me no word of our friends, Antigone, either bringing joy or bringing\n pain has come since we two were robbed of our two brothers who died in\n one day by a double blow. ",
        "4":"And since\n the Argive army has fled during\n this night, I have learned nothing further, whether better fortune is\n mine, or further ruin.",
        "5":"I knew it well, so I was trying to bring you outside the courtyard gates\n to this end, that you alone might hear.",
        "6":"Hear what? It is clear that you are\n brooding on some dark news.",
        "7":"Why not? Has not Creon destined our brothers, the one to honored burial,\n the other to unburied shame? Eteocles, they say, with due observance of\n right and custom, he has laid in the earth ",
        "8":"for his honor among the dead below. As for the poor\n corpse of Polyneices, however, they say that an edict has been published\n to the townsmen that no one shall bury him or mourn him, but instead\n leave him unwept, unentombed, for the birds a pleasing store",
        "9":"as they look to satisfy their hunger.\n Such, it is said, is the edict that the good Creon has laid down for you\n and for me—yes, for me—and it is said that he is coming here to proclaim\n it for the certain knowledge of those who do not already know. They say\n that he does not conduct this business lightly, ",
        "10":"but whoever performs any of these rites, for him the\n fate appointed is death by public stoning among the entire city. This is\n how things stand for you, and so you will soon show your nature, whether\n you are noble-minded, or the corrupt daughter of a noble line.",
        "11":"Poor sister, if things have come to this, what would I ",
        "12":"profit by loosening or tightening this knot?",
        "13":"Consider whether you will share the toil and the task.",
        "14":"What are you hazarding? What do you intend?",
        "15":"Will you join your hand to mine in order to lift his corpse?",
        "16":"You plan to bury him—when it is forbidden to the city?",
        "17":"Yes, he is my brother, and yours\n too, even if you wish it otherwise. I will never be convicted of\n betraying him.",
        "18":"Hard girl! Even when Creon has forbidden it?",
        "19":"No, he has no right to keep me from my own.",
        "20":"Ah, no! Think, sister, how our father ",
        "21":"perished in hatred and infamy, when, because of the crimes that he\n himself detected, he smashed both his eyes with self-blinding hand; then\n his mother-wife, two names in one, with a twisted noose destroyed her\n life; ",
        "22":"lastly, our two brothers\n in a single day, both unhappy murderers of their own flesh and blood,\n worked with mutual hands their common doom. And now we, in turn—we two\n who have been left all alone—consider how much more miserably we will be\n destroyed, if in defiance of the law ",
        "23":"we transgress against an autocrat’s decree or his powers.\n No, we must remember, first, that ours is a woman’s nature, and\n accordingly not suited to battles against men; and next, that we are\n ruled by the more powerful, so that we must obey in these things and in\n things even more stinging. ",
        "24":"I, therefore, will\n ask those below for pardon, since I am forced to this, and will obey\n those who have come to authority. It is foolish to do what is\n fruitless.",
        "25":"I would not encourage you—no, nor, even if you were willing\n later, ",
        "26":"would I welcome you as\n my partner in this action. No, be the sort that pleases you. I will bury\n him—it would honor me to die while doing that. I shall rest with him,\n loved one with loved one, a pious criminal. For the time is\n greater ",
        "27":"that I must serve the\n dead than the living, since in that world I will rest forever. But if\n you so choose, continue to dishonor what the gods in honor have\n established.",
        "28":"I do them no dishonor. But to act in violation of the\n citizens’ will—of that I am by nature incapable.",
        "29":"You can make that your pretext!\n Regardless, I will go now to heap a tomb over the brother I love.",
        "30":"Oh no, unhappy sister! I fear for you!",
        "31":"Do not tremble for me. Straighten out your own destiny.",
        "32":"Then at least disclose the deed to no one before you do it.",
        "33":"Conceal it, instead, in secrecy—and so,\n too, will I.",
        "34":"Go on! Denounce it! You will be far more hated for your silence, if you\n fail to proclaim these things to everyone.",
        "35":"You have a hot heart for chilling deeds.",
        "36":"I know that I please those whom I am most bound to please.",
        "37":"Yes, if you will also have the\n power. But you crave the impossible.",
        "38":"Why then, when my strength fails, I will have finished.",
        "39":"An impossible hunt should not be tried in the first place.",
        "40":"If you mean that, you will have my hatred, and you will be subject to\n punishment as the enemy of the dead. ",
        "41":"But leave me and the foolish plan I have authored to suffer this\n terrible thing, for I will not suffer anything so terrible that my death\n will lack honor.",
        "42":"Go, then, if you so decide. And of this be sure: though\n your path is foolish, to your loved ones your love is straight and\n true. Exit Antigone on the spectators’ left. Ismene exits into\n the palace.",
        "43":"Shaft of the sun, fairest light of all that have dawned\n on Thebes of the seven\n gates, you have shone forth at last, eye of golden day, advancing\n over Dirce’s streams!",
        "44":"You have goaded with a sharper bit the\n warrior of the white shield, who came from Argos in full armor, driving him to\n headlong retreat.",
        "45":"He set out against our land\n because of the strife-filled claims of Polyneices, and like a screaming\n eagle he flew over into our land, covered by his snow-white\n wing, ",
        "46":"with a mass of weapons\n and crested helmets.",
        "47":"He paused above our dwellings; he\n gaped around our sevenfold portals with spears thirsting for blood; but\n he left ",
        "48":"before his jaws were ever glutted with our gore, or\n before the Fire-god’s pine-fed flame had seized our crown of towers. ",
        "49":"So\n fierce was the crash of battle swelling about his back, a match too hard\n to win for the rival of the dragon.",
        "50":"For Zeus detests above all the\n boasts of a proud tongue. And when he saw them advancing in a swollen\n flood, ",
        "51":"arrogant their clanging\n gold, he dashed with brandished fire one who was already starting to\n shout victory when he had reached our ramparts.",
        "52":"Staggered, he fell to the earth\n with a crash, ",
        "53":"torch in hand, a man\n possessed by the frenzy of the mad attack, who just now was raging\n against us with the blasts of his tempestuous hate. But his threats did\n not fare as he had hoped, and to the other enemies mighty Ares dispensed\n each their own dooms with hard blows, ",
        "54":"Ares, our mighty ally at the turning-point.",
        "55":"For the seven captains, stationed\n against an equal number at the seven gates, left behind their brazen\n arms in tribute to Zeus the turner of battle—all but the accursed pair\n who, born of one father and one ",
        "56":"mother, set against each other their spears, both victorious, and who\n now share in a common death.",
        "57":"But since Victory whose name is\n glory has come to us, smiling in joy equal to the joy of chariot-rich\n Thebes , ",
        "58":"let us make for ourselves forgetfulness after\n the recent wars, and visit all the temples of the gods with night-long\n dance and song. And may Bacchus, who shakes the earth of Thebes , rule our dancing!",
        "59":"But look, the king of the land is\n coming here, Creon, the son of Menoeceus, our new ruler in accordance\n with the new circumstances fated by the gods. What policy is he setting\n in motion, ",
        "60":"that he has proposed\n this special conference of elders, and summoned it by a general\n mandate?",
        "61":"My fellow citizens! First, the\n gods, after tossing the fate of our city on wild waves, have once more\n righted it. Second, I have ordered you through my messengers to come\n here ",
        "62":"apart from all the rest,\n because I knew, first of all, how constant was your reverence for the\n power of the throne of Laius; how, again, you were reverent, when\n Oedipus was guiding our city; and lastly, how, when he was dead, you\n still maintained loyal thoughts towards his children. ",
        "63":"Since, then, these latter have fallen in one day by a\n twofold doom—each striking, each struck, both with the stain of a\n brother’s murder—I now possess all the power and the throne according to\n my kinship with the dead. ",
        "64":"Now, it is impossible to know fully any man’s character,\n will, or judgment, until he has been proved by the test of rule and\n law-giving. For if anyone who directs the entire city does not cling to\n the best and wisest plans, ",
        "65":"but because of some\n fear keeps his lips locked, then, in my judgment, he is and has long\n been the most cowardly traitor. And if any man thinks a friend more\n important than his fatherland, that man, I say, is of no account. Zeus,\n god who sees all things always, be my witness— ",
        "66":"I would not be silent if I saw ruin, instead of safety,\n marching upon the citizens. Nor would I ever make a man who is hostile\n to my country a friend to myself, because I know this, that our country\n is the ship that bears us safe, and that only when ",
        "67":"we sail her on a straight course can we make\n true friends. Such are the rules by which I strengthen this city. Akin\n to these is the edict which I have now published to the citizenry\n concerning the sons of Oedipus: Eteocles, who fell fighting",
        "68":"in behalf of our city and who excelled\n all in battle, they shall entomb and heap up every sacred offering that\n descends to the noblest of the dead below. But as for his brother,\n Polyneices, I mean, who on his return from exile wanted to burn to the\n ground ",
        "69":"the city of his fathers and his race’s gods, and wanted\n to feed on kindred blood and lead the remnant into slavery—it has been\n proclaimed to the city that no one shall give him funeral honors or\n lamentation, ",
        "70":"but all must leave him unburied and a sight of shame,\n with his body there for birds and dogs to eat. This is my will, and\n never will I allow the traitor to stand in honor before the just. But\n whoever has good will to Thebes , ",
        "71":"he shall\n be honored by me in death as in life.",
        "72":"That is your will, Creon, towards this city’s enemy and\n its friend. And the power is yours, I believe, to make use of every law\n whatsoever, both concerning the dead and all us who live.",
        "73":"See, then, that you be guardians\n of my commands.",
        "74":"Lay the weight of this task on some younger man.",
        "75":"That is not what I meant—the guards for the corpse are already in\n place.",
        "76":"Then what is this other command that you would give?",
        "77":"That you not give way to the breakers of my commands.",
        "78":"There is no one so foolish as to\n crave death.",
        "79":"I assure you, that is the wage for disobedience. Yet by just the hope of\n it, money has many times corrupted men.",
        "80":"My king, I will not say that I arrive breathless because of speed, or\n from the action of a swift foot. ",
        "81":"For often I brought myself to a stop because of my thoughts, and\n wheeled round in my path to return. My mind was telling me many things:\n Fool, why do you go to where your arrival will mean your punishment? \n Idiot, are you dallying again? If Creon learns it from another, must\n you not suffer for it? ",
        "82":"So\n debating, I made my way unhurriedly, slow, and thus a short road was\n made long. At last, however, the view prevailed that I should come\n here—to you. Even if my report brings no good, still will I tell\n you, ",
        "83":"since I come with a good\n grip on one hope, that I can suffer nothing except what is my fate.",
        "84":"And what is it that so disheartens you?",
        "85":"I want to tell you first about myself—I did not do the deed, nor did I\n see the doer, ",
        "86":"so it would be wrong\n that I should come to any harm.",
        "87":"Like a bowman you aim well at your target from a distance, and all around\n you hedge yourself off well from the deed. It is clear that you have\n some unheard-of thing to tell.",
        "88":"That I do, for terrible news imposes great hesitation.",
        "89":"Then tell it, will you, and so unburdened go away?",
        "90":"Well, here it is. The corpse—some\n one has just given it burial and disappeared after sprinkling thirsty\n dust on the flesh and performing the other rites that piety demands.",
        "91":"What are you saying? What man dared do this?",
        "92":"I do not know. For there was no scar of a pickax to be seen\n there, ",
        "93":"no earth thrown up by a\n mattock. The ground was hard and dry, unbroken, not rolled over by\n wheels. The doer was someone who left no trace. When the first\n day-watchman showed it to us, a discomforting amazement fell on us\n all. ",
        "94":"The dead man was veiled\n from us—not shut within a tomb, but a light cover of dust was on him, as\n if put there by the hand of one who shunned a curse. And no sign was\n visible that any beast of prey or any dog had approached or torn him.\n Then evil words flew thick and loud among us, ",
        "95":"guard accusing guard. It would even have come to blows\n in the end, nor was there anyone there to prevent it: every man was the\n culprit, and no one was plainly guilty, while all disclaimed knowledge\n of the act. We were ready to take red-hot iron in our hands,",
        "96":"to walk through fire and to swear oaths\n by the gods that we had neither done the deed, nor shared knowledge of\n the planning or the doing. At last, when our investigating got us\n nowhere, someone spoke up and made us all bend our faces",
        "97":"in fear towards the earth. For we did\n not know how we could argue with him, nor yet prosper, if we did what he\n said. His argument was that the deed must be reported to you and not\n hidden. This view prevailed, and so it was that ",
        "98":"the lot doomed miserable me to win this prize. So here\n I stand, as unwelcome to you as I am unwilling, I well know. For no man\n delights in the bearer of bad news.",
        "99":"My king, my thoughts have long been deliberating whether this deed is\n somehow the work of gods?",
        "100":"Quiet, before your words truly\n fill me with rage, so that you not be found at the same time foolish as\n well as old. You say what is intolerable when you claim that the gods\n have concern for that corpse. Was it in high esteem for his\n benefactions ",
        "101":"that they sought\n to hide him, when he had come to burn their columned shrines, their\n sacred treasures and their land, and scatter its laws to the winds? Or\n do you see the gods honoring the wicked? It cannot be. No! From the very\n first ",
        "102":"certain men of the city\n were chafing at this edict and muttering against me, tossing their heads\n in secret, and they did not keep their necks duly under the yoke in\n submission to me. By those men, I am certain, they were led astray and\n bribed to do this deed. ",
        "103":"Nothing so\n evil as money ever grew to be current among men. This destroys cities,\n this drives men from their homes, this trains and warps honest minds to\n set themselves to works of shame, ",
        "104":"this teaches people to practise villainies, and to know every act of\n unholiness. But all the men who did this job for hire have made sure\n that, sooner or later, they shall suffer the punishment. Now, as Zeus\n still has my reverence, know this well— ",
        "105":"I tell you on my oath. If you do not find the very hand\n that made this burial, and reveal him before my eyes, mere death shall\n not suffice for you, not before, hung up alive, you have made this\n outrage plain, ",
        "106":"so that hereafter\n you may thieve with better knowledge of where your money should be\n received from, and learn that it is best not to be fond of money-making\n from any and every source. For you will find that ill-gotten gains bring\n more men to ruin than to safety.",
        "107":"Will you allow me to speak? Or\n shall I just turn and go?",
        "108":"Do you not know even now how much your voice sickens me?",
        "109":"Is the pain in your ears, or in your soul?",
        "110":"And why would you define the seat of my pain?",
        "111":"He who did it hurts your heart, but I, your ears.",
        "112":"God! How plain it is that you are\n a born babbler.",
        "113":"Perhaps, but never the author of this action.",
        "114":"Yes, and what is more, you sold your life for silver.",
        "115":"Ah! It is truly sad when the judge judges wrong .",
        "116":"Expound on judgment as you will. But, if you fail to ",
        "117":"show me the perpetrators of these crimes, you\n will avow that money basely earned wreaks sorrows. Exit\n Creon.",
        "118":"Well, may the man be found! That would be best. But, whether he be caught\n or not—for fortune must decide that—I assure you that you will not see\n me come here again. ",
        "119":"Saved just now\n beyond hope and belief, I owe the gods great thanks. Exit the\n Guard.",
        "120":"Wonders are many, and none is more\n wonderful than man. ",
        "121":"This power\n spans the sea, even when it surges white before the gales of the\n south-wind, and makes a path under swells that threaten to engulf him.\n Earth, too, the eldest of the gods, the immortal, the\n unwearied, ",
        "122":"he wears away to\n his own ends, turning the soil with the offspring of horses as the plows\n weave to and fro year after year.",
        "123":"The light-hearted tribe of\n birds ",
        "124":"and the clans of wild\n beasts and the sea-brood of the deep he snares in the meshes of his\n twisted nets, and he leads them captive, very-skilled man. He masters by\n his arts ",
        "125":"the beast who dwells in\n the wilds and roams the hills. He tames the shaggy-maned horse, putting\n the yoke upon its neck, and tames the tireless mountain bull.",
        "126":"Speech and thought fast as\n the ",
        "127":"wind and the moods that\n give order to a city he has taught himself, and how to flee the arrows\n of the inhospitable frost under clear skies and the arrows of the\n storming rain. ",
        "128":"He has resource for\n everything. Lacking resource in nothing he strides towards what must\n come. From Death alone he shall procure no escape, but from baffling\n diseases he has devised flights.",
        "129":"Possessing resourceful skill, a\n subtlety beyond expectation he moves now to evil, now to good. When he\n honors the laws of the land and the justice of the gods to which he is\n bound by oath, ",
        "130":"his city prospers.\n But banned from his city is he who, thanks to his rashness, couples with\n disgrace. Never may he share my home, ",
        "131":"never think my thoughts, who does these things!",
        "132":"What marvel sent by the gods is this?—I am\n bewildered! I know her. How can I deny that this girl is Antigone? O\n unhappy child ",
        "133":"of your unhappy father, of Oedipus! What can this\n mean? What! Surely they are not bringing you captive for disobeying\n the King’s laws and being caught in lunacy?",
        "134":"Here is she, the one who did the deed. ",
        "135":"We caught this one burying him. Where is Creon?",
        "136":"There, he is coming from the house again at our need.",
        "137":"What is it? What has happened that makes my coming timely?",
        "138":"My king, there is nothing that a man can rightly swear he\n will not do. For second thought belies one’s first intent. ",
        "139":"I could have vowed that I would not ever come here\n again, because of your threats by which I had just been storm-tossed.\n But since this joy that exceeds and oversteps my hopes can be compared\n in fulness to no other pleasure, I am back—though it is contrary to my\n sworn oath— ",
        "140":"bringing this girl who\n was caught giving burial honors to the dead. This time there was no\n casting of lots. No, this piece of luck has fallen to me, and me alone.\n And now, my king, as it pleases you, take her yourself, question her and\n convict her. But justice would see me ",
        "141":"released free and clear from this trouble.",
        "142":"Your prisoner here—how and where did you take her?",
        "143":"She was burying the man. You know all there is to tell.",
        "144":"Are you clear and sure about what you are saying?",
        "145":"I am. I saw her burying the corpse that you ",
        "146":"had forbidden to bury. Is that plain and\n sufficient?",
        "147":"And how was she observed? How taken in the act?",
        "148":"It happened like this. When we had come to the place with those fierce\n threats of yours still in our ears, we swept away all the dust that\n covered ",
        "149":"the corpse and bared\n the damp body well. We then sat down on the brow of the hill to\n windward, fleeing the smell from him, lest it strike us. Each man was\n wide awake and kept his neighbor alert with torrents of threats, if any\n one should be careless of this task. ",
        "150":"So time passed, until the disk of the sun stood bright\n in mid-sky and the heat began to burn. And then suddenly a whirlwind\n lifted from the earth a storm of dust, a trouble in the sky, and it\n filled the plain, marring all the foliage of its woods. ",
        "151":"Soon the wide air was choked with it. We closed\n our eyes, and endured the plague from the gods. When, after a long\n while, this storm had passed, the girl was seen, and she wailed aloud\n with the sharp cry of a grieving bird, as when inside her\n empty ",
        "152":"nest she sees the bed\n stripped of its nestlings. So she, too, when she saw the corpse bare,\n broke into a cry of lamentation and cursed with harsh curses those who\n had done it. Immediately she took thirsty dust in her hands,",
        "153":"and from a pitcher of beaten bronze held\n high she crowned the dead with thrice-poured libations. We rushed\n forward when we saw it, and at once closed upon our quarry, who was not\n at all dismayed. We then charged her with her past and present\n doings, ",
        "154":"but she made no denial of anything—at once to my joy and\n to my pain. For to have escaped from trouble one’s self gives the\n greatest joy, but it stings to lead friends to evil. Naturally, though,\n all such things are ",
        "155":"of less account to me than my own safety.",
        "156":"You, you with your face bent to the ground, do you admit, or deny that\n you did this?",
        "157":"I declare it and make no denial.",
        "158":"You can take yourself wherever you please, ",
        "159":"free and clear of a heavy charge. Exit\n Guard.",
        "160":"You, however, tell me—not at length, but briefly—did you know that an\n edict had forbidden this?",
        "161":"I knew it. How could I not? It was public.",
        "162":"And even so you dared overstep that law?",
        "163":"Yes, since it was not Zeus that\n published me that edict, and since not of that kind are the laws which\n Justice who dwells with the gods below established among men. Nor did I\n think that your decrees were of such force, that a mortal could override\n the unwritten ",
        "164":"and unfailing statutes given us by the gods. For their\n life is not of today or yesterday, but for all time, and no man knows\n when they were first put forth. Not for fear of any man’s pride was I\n about to owe a penalty to the gods for breaking these. ",
        "165":"Die I\n must, that I knew well (how could I not?). That is true even without\n your edicts. But if I am to die before my time, I count that a gain.\n When anyone lives as I do, surrounded by evils, how can he not carry off\n gain by dying? ",
        "166":"So for me to meet this doom is a grief of no account.\n But if I had endured that my mother’s son should in death lie an\n unburied corpse, that would have grieved me. Yet for this, I am not\n grieved. And if my present actions are foolish in your sight, ",
        "167":"it may\n be that it is a fool who accuses me of folly.",

        "369":"And Dryas’s son, the Edonian king swift to rage, was\n tamed in recompense for his frenzied insults, when, by the will of\n Dionysus, he was shut in a rocky prison. There the fierce and\n swelling force of his madness trickled away. ",
        "370":"That man came to know the god whom in his\n frenzy he had provoked with mockeries. For he had sought to quell the\n god-inspired women and the Bacchanalian fire, ",

        "393":"But when an error is made, that man is no longer unwise\n or unblessed who heals the evil into which he has fallen and does not\n remain stubborn. Self-will, we know, invites the charge of foolishness.\n Concede the claim of the dead. Do not kick at the fallen. ",
        "394":"What prowess is it to kill the dead all over again? I\n have considered for your good, and what I advise is good. The sweetest\n thing is to learn from a good advisor when his advice is to your\n profit.",

        "397":"not even if the eagles of Zeus wish to snatch and carry\n him to be devoured at the god’s throne. No, not even then, for fear of\n that defilement will I permit his burial, since I know with certainty\n that no mortal has the power to defile the gods. ",

        "432":"and hurry to that place there in view! But since my\n judgment has taken this turn, I will be there to set her free, as I\n myself confined her. I am held by the fear that it is best to keep the\n established laws to life’s very end.",

        "437":"and Castalia’s stream sees you, too. The ivy-mantled\n slopes of Nysa ’s hills and\n the shore green with many-clustered vines send you, when accompanied\n by the cries of your divine words, ",
        "438":"you visit the\n avenues of Thebes .",
        "439":"Thebes of all cities you hold foremost in honor,\n together with your lightning-struck mother. ",
        "440":"And now when the whole city is held subject to a\n violent plague, come, we ask, with purifying feet over steep Parnassus , ",
        "441":"or over the groaning straits!",

        "444":"Neighbors of the house of Cadmus and of Amphion, there\n is no station of human life that I would ever praise or blame as being\n settled. Fortune sets upright and Fortune sinks the lucky and unlucky\n from day to day, ",
        "445":"and no one can prophesy to men concerning the order\n that has just been established. For Creon, as I saw it, was once blest:\n he had saved this land of Cadmus from its enemies; and having won sole\n and total dominion in the land, he guided it on a straight course and\n flourished in his noble crop of children. ",
        "446":"And now all this has been lost. When a man has\n forfeited his pleasures, I do not reckon his existence as life, but\n consider him just a breathing corpse. Heap up riches in your house, if\n you wish! Live with a tyrant’s pomp! But if there is no joy",
        "447":"along with all of that, I would not pay even the shadow\n of smoke for all the rest, compared with joy.",

        "458":"At one and the same time I was loosening the bolts of\n the gate to open it, and the sound of a blow to our house struck my ear.\n In terror I sank back into the arms of my handmaids, and my senses fled. ",

        "460":"Dear mistress, I will tell what I witnessed and leave no\n word of the truth unspoken. For what good would it do that should I\n soothe you with words in which I must later be found false? ",
        "461":"The truth is always best. I attended your husband as\n his guide to the furthest part of the plain, where unpitied the body of\n Polyneices, torn by dogs, still lay. After we had prayed to the goddess\n of the roads ",
        "462":"and to Pluto to restrain their anger in mercy, we\n washed him with pure washing, and with freshly-plucked boughs we burned\n what remains there were. Lastly we heaped a high-mounded tomb of his\n native earth. Afterwards we turned away to enter the maiden’s\n stoney-bedded ",
        "463":"bridal chamber, the caverned mansion of Hades’ bride.\n From a distance, one of us servants heard a voice of loud wailing near\n that bride’s unwept bed and came to tell our master Creon. And as the\n King moved closer and closer, obscure signs rising from a bitter cry\n surrounded him— ",
        "464":"he groaned and said in bitter lament, Ah, misery, am I now the prophet of evil? Am I going on the path\n most lined with grief of all that I have walked before? My son’s\n voice greets me. Go, my servants, \n ",
        "465":"hurry closer, and when\n you have reached the tomb, enter the opening where the stones of the\n mound have been torn away, up to the cell’s very mouth. See if it is\n Haemon’s voice that I recognize, or if I am cheated by the\n gods.",
        "466":"This search, at our desperate master’s word, ",
        "467":"we went to make, and in the furthest part of the tomb\n we saw her hanging by the neck, fastened by a halter of fine linen\n threads, while he was embracing her with arms thrown around her waist,\n bewailing the loss of his bride to the spirits below, as well as his\n father’s deeds, and his grief-filled marriage. ",
        "468":"But his father, when he saw him, cried aloud with a\n dreadful cry and went in and called to him with a voice of wailing: Ah, unhappy boy, what have you done! What plan have\n you seized on? By what misfortune have you lost your reason? \n ",
        "469":"Come out, my son, I pray\n you, I beg you! But the boy glared at him with savage eyes, spat\n in his face, and without a word in response drew his twin-edged sword.\n As his father rushed out in flight, he missed his aim. Then the\n ill-fated boy was enraged with himself ",
        "470":"and straightway stretched himself over his sword and\n drove it, half its length, into his side. Still conscious, he clasped\n the maiden in his faint embrace, and, as he gasped, he shot onto her\n pale cheek a swift stream of oozing blood. ",
        "471":"Corpse enfolding corpse he lay, having won his marriage\n rites, poor boy, not here, but in Hades’ palace, and having shown to\n mankind by how much the failure to reason wisely is the most severe of\n all afflictions assigned to man. Eurydice departs into the\n house. \n ",
        "472":"What would you infer from this? The lady ",
        "473":"has turned back and gone without a word, either for\n good or for evil.",
        "474":"I, too, am startled. Still I am nourished by the hope that\n at the grave news of her son she thinks it unworthy to make her laments\n before the city, but in the shelter of her home will set her handmaids\n to mourn the house’s grief. ",
        "475":"For she is not unhabituated to discretion, that she\n should err.",
        "476":"I do not know. But to me, in any case, a silence too strict\n seems to promise trouble just as much as a fruitless abundance of\n weeping.",
        "477":"I will find out whether she is not, in fact, hiding some\n repressed plan in the darkness of her passionate heart. ",
        "478":"I will go in, since you are right—in an excess of\n silence, too, there may be trouble. Exit Messenger.",
        "479":"Look, here is the King himself approaching, his hands\n grasping a monument plainly signing that his—if we may say it—and no\n one else’s,",
        "480":"was the madness of this error.",
        "481":"Ah, the blunders of an unthinking\n mind, blunders of rigidity, yielding death! Oh, you witnesses of the\n killers and the killed, both of one family! ",
        "482":"What misery arises from my reasonings! Haemon, you have\n died after a young life, youngest and last of my sons! O God! You have\n departed not by your foolishness, but by my own!",
        "483":"Ah, how late you seem to see the\n right!",
        "484":"God, I have mastered the bitter lesson! But then, then, I think, some god\n struck me on my head with a crushing weight, and drove me into savage\n paths, ",
        "485":"—ah!—and overthrew my\n joy to be trampled on! Ah, the labors men must toil through!",
        "486":"My master, you have come, I\n think, like one whose hands are not empty, but who has a ready store:\n first, you carry that burden visible in your arms; ",
        "487":"second, you will soon look upon further\n sufferings inside your house.",
        "488":"What worse suffering is still to follow upon these sufferings?",
        "489":"Your wife is dead, true mother of that corpse, poor lady, by wounds newly\n cut.",
        "490":"O harbor of Hades, hard to\n purify! ",
        "491":"Why, why do you ruin\n me? Herald of evil, of grief, what word do you say? Ah, you have done in\n a dead man anew! What are you saying, boy? What is this you report to\n me ",
        "492":"God no!—what new slaughter, my wife’s doom, is heaped\n upon this ruin?",
        "493":"The sight is at hand. It is no longer hidden inside.",
        "494":"Ah, misery! ",
        "495":"There I see a new, a\n second evil! What destiny, ah, what, can still await me? I have just now\n taken my son in my arms, and now I see another corpse before\n me! ",
        "496":"Oh, tormented mother! Oh,\n my son!",
        "497":"By the altar, with a\n sharp-whetted sword, she struck until her eyes went slack and dark.\n Before that she bewailed the noble fate of Megareus who died earlier,\n and then the fate of this boy, and also, with her last breath,",
        "498":"she called down evil fortune upon you,\n the slayer of her sons.",
        "499":"Ah, no! I tremble with fear. Why\n does no one strike me full on my chest with a two-edged sword?",
        "500":"I am miserable—ah—and bathed in\n miserable anguish!",
        "501":"Yes, because you were accused of responsibility for both\n this son’s death, and the other’s, by her whose corpse you see.",
        "502":"What was the manner of the violent deed by which she departed?",
        "503":"Her own hand struck her to the heart upon learning her\n son’s sharply-lamented fate.",
        "504":"Ah this guilt can never be\n fastened onto any other mortal so as to remove my own! It was I, yes, I,\n who killed you, I the wretch. ",
        "505":"I\n admit the truth. Lead me away, my servants, lead me from here with all\n haste, who am no more than a dead man!",
        "506":"The course you recommend is to\n your gain, if there can be gain amidst evil. What is briefest is best,\n when trouble lies at your feet.",
        "507":"Let it come, let it appear, that\n fairest of fates for me, that brings my final day, ",
        "508":"the fate supreme! Oh, let it come, so that I may never\n see tomorrow’s light!",
        "509":"These things are in the future.\n We must see to present affairs. ",
