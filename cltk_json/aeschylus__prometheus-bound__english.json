        "0":"To earth’s remotest limit we come, to the Scythian land, an untrodden solitude. And now, Hephaestus, yours is the charge to observe the mandates laid upon you by the Father—to clamp this miscreant",
        "1":"upon the high craggy rocks in shackles of binding adamant that cannot be broken. For your own flower, flashing fire, source of all arts, he has purloined and bestowed upon mortal creatures. Such is his offence; for this he is bound to make requital to the gods,",
        "2":"so that he may learn to bear with the sovereignty of Zeus and cease his man-loving ways.\n ",
        "3":"Power and Force, for you indeed the behest of Zeus is now fulfilled, and nothing remains to stop you. But for me—I do not have the nerve myself",
        "4":"to bind with force a kindred god upon this rocky cleft assailed by cruel winter. Yet, come what may, I am constrained to summon courage to this deed; for it is perilous to disregard the commandments of the Father.\n Lofty-minded son of Themis who counsels straight, against my will, no less than yours, I must rivet you with brazen bonds",
        "5":"no hand can loose to this desolate crag, where neither voice nor form of mortal man shall you perceive; but, scorched by the sun’s bright beams, you shall lose the fair bloom of your flesh. And glad you shall be when spangled-robed night shall veil his brightness and",
        "6":"when the sun shall scatter again the frost of morning. Evermore the burden of your present ill shall wear you out; for your deliverer is not yet born.\n Such is the prize you have gained for your championship of man. For, god though you are, you did not fear the wrath of the gods, but",
        "7":"you bestowed honors upon mortal creatures beyond their due. Therefore on this joyless rock you must stand sentinel, erect, sleepless, your knee unbent. And many a groan and unavailing lament you shall utter; for the heart of Zeus is hard,",
        "8":"and everyone is harsh whose power is new.\n ",
        "9":"Well, why delay and excite pity in vain? Why do you not detest a god most hateful to the gods, since he has betrayed your prerogative to mortals?\n ",
        "10":"A strangely potent tie is kinship, and companionship as well.\n ",
        "11":"I agree; yet to refuse to obey the commands of the Father; is this possible? Do you not fear that more?\n ",
        "12":"Yes, you are ever pitiless and steeped in insolence.\n ",
        "13":"Yes, for it does not good to bemoan this fellow. Stop wasting your labor at an unprofitable task.\n ",
        "14":"Oh handicraft that I hate so much!\n ",
        "15":"Why hate it? Since in truth your craft is in no way to blame for these present troubles.\n ",

        "22":"Cast them about his wrists and with might strike with your hammer; rivet him to the rocks.\n ",
        "23":"There! The work is getting done and not improperly.\n ",
        "24":"Strike harder, clamp him tight, leave nothing loose; for he is wondrously clever at finding a way even out of desperate straits.\n ",
        "25":"This arm, at least, is fixed permanently.\n ",
        "26":"Now rivet this one too and securely, so that he may learn, for all his cleverness, that he is a fool compared to Zeus.\n ",
        "27":"None but he could justly blame my work.\n ",

        "31":"What! Shrinking again and groaning over the enemies of Zeus? Take care, so that the day does not come when you shall grieve for yourself.\n ",

        "42":"There now, indulge your insolence, keep on wresting from the gods their honors to give them to creatures of a day. Are mortals able to lighten your load of sorrow?",

        "47":"throughout the countless years of time apportioned me. Such is the ignominious bondage the new commander of the blessed has devised against me. Woe! Woe! For present misery and misery to come I groan, not knowing where",

        "49":"And yet, what am I saying? All that is to be I know full well and in advance, nor shall any affliction come upon me unforeseen. I must bear my allotted doom as lightly as I can, knowing that",
        "50":"the might of Necessity permits no resistance.Yet I am not able to speak nor be silent about my fate. For it is because I bestowed good gifts on mortals that this miserable yoke of constraint has been bound upon me. I hunted out and stored in fennel stalk the stolen",
        "51":"source of fire that has proved a teacher to mortals in every art and a means to mighty ends. Such is the offence for which I pay the penalty, riveted in fetters beneath the open sky.\n\n ",
        "52":"Ha! Behold!",
        "53":"What murmur, what scent wings to me, its source invisible, heavenly or human, or both? Has someone come to this crag at the edge of the world to stare at my sufferings—or with what motive? Behold me, an ill-fated god, chained,",

        "55":"hated of all who enter the court of Zeus, because of my very great love for mankind. Ha! What’s this? What may be this rustling stir of birds I hear",
        "56":"again nearby? The air whirs with the light rush of wings. Whatever approaches causes me alarm. The Daughters of Oceanus enter on a winged car \n \n ",
        "57":"Do not fear! For our group has come in swift rivalry of wings to this crag",
        "58":"as friend to you, having won our father’s consent as best we might. The swift-coursing breezes bore me on; for the reverberation of the clang of iron pierced the depths of our caves and drove my grave modesty away in fright;",
        "59":"unsandalled I have hastened in a winged car.\n ",
        "60":"Alas! Alas! Offspring of fruitful Tethys and of him who with his sleepless current encircles the whole earth, children of your",
        "61":"father Oceanus, behold, see with what fetters, upon the summit crag of this ravine, I am to hold my unenviable watch.\n ",
        "62":"I see, Prometheus;",
        "63":"and over my eyes a mist of tears and fear spread as I saw your body withering ignominiously upon this rock in these bonds of adamant. For there are new rulers in heaven, and Zeus governs with",
        "64":"lawless customs; that which was mighty before he now brings to nothing.\n ",
        "65":"Oh if only he had hurled me below the earth, yes beneath Hades, the entertainer of the dead, into impassable Tartarus,",
        "66":"and had ruthlessly fastened me in fetters no hand can loose, so that neither god nor any other might have gloated over this agony I feel! But, now, a miserable plaything of the winds, I suffer pains to delight my enemies.\n ",
        "67":"Who of the gods is so hard of heart as to exult in this? Who does not sympathize with your woes—save only Zeus? But he in malice, has set his soul inflexibly",
        "68":"and keeps in subjection the race sprung from Uranus; nor will he stop, until he has satiated his soul or another seizes his impregnable empire by some device of guile.\n ",
        "69":"Truly the day shall come when, although I am tortured in stubborn fetters,",
        "70":"the prince of the blessed will need me to reveal the new design whereby he shall be stripped of his sceptre and his dignities. Not by persuasion’s honeyed enchantments will he charm me;",
        "71":"and I will never, cowering before his dire threats, divulge this secret, until he releases me from my cruel bonds and provides compensation for this outrage.\n ",
        "72":"You are bold, and do not yield to your bitter pangs; you give too much license to your tongue. But my soul is agitated by piercing fear, and I am in dread about your fate,",
        "73":"wondering to what haven you must steer your ship to see an end of your voyage of sorrow. For the heart of Cronus’ son is hardened against entreaty and his ways are inexorable.\n ",
        "74":"I know that Zeus is harsh and",
        "75":"keeps justice in his own hands; but nevertheless one day his judgement will soften, when he has been crushed in the way that I know. Then, calming down his stubborn wrath, he shall at last bond with me in union and friendship,",
        "76":"as eager as I am to welcome him.\n ",
        "77":"Unfold the whole story and tell us upon what charge Zeus has caught you and painfully punishes you with such dishonor. Instruct us, unless, indeed, there is some harm in telling.\n ",
        "78":"It is painful to me to tell the tale,",
        "79":"painful to keep it silent. My case is unfortunate every way.\n When first the heavenly powers were moved to wrath, and mutual dissension was stirred up among them—some bent on casting Cronus from his seat so Zeus, in truth, might reign; others, eager for",
        "80":"the contrary end, that Zeus might never win mastery over the gods—it was then that I, although advising them for the best, was unable to persuade the Titans, children of Heaven and Earth; but they, disdaining counsels of craft, in the pride of their strength",
        "81":"thought to gain the mastery without a struggle and by force. Often my mother Themis, or Earth (though one form, she had many names), had foretold to me the way in which the future was fated to come to pass. That it was not by brute strength nor through violence,",
        "82":"but by guile that those who should gain the upper hand were destined to prevail. And though I argued all this to them, they did not pay any attention to my words. With all that before me, it seemed best that, joining with my mother, I should place myself,",
        "83":"a welcome volunteer, on the side of Zeus; and it is by reason of my counsel that the cavernous gloom of Tartarus now hides ancient Cronus and his allies within it. Thus I helped the tyrant of the gods",
        "84":"and with this foul payment he has responded; for it is a disease that is somehow inherent in tyranny to have no faith in friends.\n However, you ask why he torments me, and this I will now make clear.\n \n ",
        "85":"As soon as he had seated himself upon his father’s throne, he immediately assigned to the deities their several privileges and apportioned to them their proper powers. But of wretched mortals he took no notice, desiring to bring",
        "86":"the whole race to an end and create a new one in its place. Against this purpose none dared make stand except me— I only had the courage; I saved mortals so that they did not descend, blasted utterly, to the house of Hades. This is why I am bent by such grievous tortures,",
        "87":"painful to suffer, piteous to behold. I who gave mortals first place in my pity, I am deemed unworthy to win this pity for myself, but am in this way mercilessly disciplined, a spectacle that shames the glory of Zeus.\n ",
        "88":"Iron-hearted and made of stone, Prometheus,",
        "89":"is he who feels no compassion at your miseries. For myself, I would not have desired to see them; and now that I see them, I am pained in my heart.\n ",
        "90":"Yes, to my friends indeed I am a spectacle of pity.\n ",
        "91":"Did you perhaps transgress even somewhat beyond this offence?\n ",
        "92":"Yes, I caused mortals to cease foreseeing their doom. \n \n ",
        "93":"Of what sort was the cure that you found for this affliction?\n ",
        "94":"I caused blind hopes to dwell within their breasts.\n ",
        "95":"A great benefit was this you gave to mortals.\n ",
        "96":"In addition, I gave them fire.\n ",
        "97":"What! Do creatures of a day now have flame-eyed fire?\n ",
        "98":"Yes, and from it they shall learn many arts.\n ",
        "99":"Then it was on a charge like this that Zeus—\n ",
        "100":"Torments me and in no way gives me respite from pain.\n ",
        "101":"And is there no end assigned to your ordeal?\n ",
        "102":"No, none except when it seems good to him.\n ",
        "103":"But how will it seem good to him? What hope is there? Do you not see that you have wronged? And yet it is not pleasant for me to talk about how you have wronged, and for you it is pain. So, let us quit this theme; and may you seek some release from your ordeal.\n ",
        "104":"It is easy for him who keeps his foot free from harm to counsel and admonish him who is in misery. I have known this all the while. Of my own will, yes, of my own will I erred—I will not deny it. By helping mortals I found suffering for myself;",
        "105":"nevertheless I did not think I would be punished in this way—wasting away upon cliffs in mid-air, my portion this desolate and dreary crag. And now, bewail no more my present woes; alight on the ground and listen to my",
        "106":"oncoming fortunes so that you may be told them from end to end. Consent, I beg you, oh consent. Take part in the trouble of him who is now in sore distress. In truth, affliction wanders impartially abroad and alights upon all in turn.\n ",
        "107":"Not to unwilling ears have you made this appeal,",
        "108":"Prometheus. And so now with light foot I will quit my swift-speeding seat and the pure air, the pathway of birds and draw near to this rugged ground; for I want to hear",
        "109":"the whole story of your sorrows.\n ",
        "110":"I have come to the end of a long journey in my passage to you, Prometheus, guiding by my own will, without a bridle, this swift-winged bird.",
        "111":"For your fate, you may be sure, I feel compassion. Kinship, I think, constrains me to this; and, apart from blood ties, there is none to whom I should pay greater respect than to you.",
        "112":"You shall know this for simple truth and that it is not in me to utter vain and empty words; come, tell me; what aid can I render you? For you shall never say that you have a friend more loyal than Oceanus.\n ",
        "113":"Ha! What have we here? So then you too have come to stare upon my sufferings? How did you summon courage to quit the stream that bears your name and the rock-roofed caves you yourself have made and come to this land, the mother of iron? Is it that you have come",
        "114":"to gaze upon my state and join your grief to my distress? Look upon me here—a spectacle, the friend of Zeus, who helped him to establish his sovereign power, by what anguish I am bent by him!\n ",
        "115":"I see, Prometheus; and I want to give you",
        "116":"the best advice, although you yourself are wily. Learn to know yourself and adapt yourself to new ways; for new also is the ruler among the gods. If you hurl forth words so harsh and of such whetted edge, perhaps Zeus may hear you,",
        "117":"though throned far off, high in the heavens, and then your present multitude of sorrows shall seem but childish sport. Oh wretched sufferer! Put away your wrathful mood and try to find release from these miseries. Perhaps this advice may seem to you old and dull;",
        "118":"but your plight, Prometheus, is only the wages of too boastful speech. You still have not learned humility, nor do you bend before misfortune, but would rather add even more miseries to those you have. Therefore take me as your teacher",
        "119":"and do not add insult to injury, seeing that a harsh monarch now rules who is accountable to no one. So now I will depart and see whether I can release you from these sufferings. And may you hold your peace and be not too blustering of speech.",
        "120":"Or, can it be that for all your exceeding wisdom, you do not know that chastisement is inflicted on a wagging tongue?\n ",
        "121":"I envy you because you have escaped blame for having dared to share with me in my troubles. So now leave me alone and let it not concern you. ",
        "122":"Do what you want, you cannot persuade him; for he is not easy to persuade. Beware that you do not do yourself harm by the mission you take.\n ",
        "123":"In truth, you are far better able to admonish others than yourself. It is by fact, not by hearsay, that I judge.",
        "124":"So do not hold back one who is eager to go. For I am confident, yes, confident, that Zeus will grant me this favor, to free you from your sufferings.\n ",
        "125":"I thank you for all this and shall never cease to thank you; in zeal you lack nothing, but do not trouble yourself; for your trouble will be vain and",
        "126":"not helpful to me—if indeed you want to take the pain. No, keep quiet and keep yourself clear of harm. For even if I am in sore plight, I would not wish affliction on everyone else. No, certainly, no! since, besides, I am distressed by the fate",
        "127":"of my brother Atlas, who, towards the west, stands bearing on his shoulders the pillar of heaven and earth, a burden not easy for his arms to grasp. Pity moved me, too, at the sight of the earth-born dweller of the Cilician caves curbed by violence, that destructive monster",
        "128":"of a hundred heads, impetuous Typhon. He withstood all the gods, hissing out terror with horrid jaws, while from his eyes lightened a hideous glare, as though he would storm by force the sovereignty of Zeus.",
        "129":"But the unsleeping bolt of Zeus came upon him, the swooping lightning brand with breath of flame, which struck him, frightened, from his loud-mouthed boasts; then, stricken to the very heart, he was burnt to ashes and his strength blasted from him by the lightning bolt.",
        "130":"And now, a helpless and a sprawling bulk, he lies hard by the narrows of the sea, pressed down beneath the roots of Aetna ; while on the topmost summit Hephaestus sits and hammers the molten ore. There, one day, shall burst forth",
        "131":"rivers of fire, with savage jaws devouring the level fields of Sicily , land of fair fruit—such boiling rage shall Typho, although charred by the blazing lightning of Zeus, send spouting forth with hot jets of appalling, fire-breathing surge.\n \n ",
        "132":"But you are not inexperienced, and do not need me to teach you. Save yourself, as you know best; while I exhaust my present lot until the time comes when the mind of Zeus shall abandon its wrath.\n ",
        "133":"Do you not know then, Prometheus, that",
        "134":"words are the physicians of a disordered temper?\n ",
        "135":"If one softens the soul in season, and does not hasten to reduce its swelling rage by violence.\n ",
        "136":"What lurking mischief do you see when daring joins to zeal? Teach me this.\n ",
        "137":"Lost labor and thoughtless simplicity.\n ",
        "138":"Leave me to be affected by this, since it is most advantageous, when truly wise, to be deemed a fool.\n ",
        "139":"This fault will be seen to be my own.\n ",
        "140":"Clearly the manner of your speech orders me back home.\n ",
        "141":"So that you won’t win enmity for yourself by lamenting for me.\n ",
        "142":"In the eyes of the one who is newly seated on his omnipotent throne?\n ",
        "143":"Beware lest the time come when his heart is angered with you.\n ",
        "144":"Your plight, Prometheus, is my instructor.\n ",
        "145":"Go away, depart, keep your present purpose.\n ",
        "146":"Your urging meets my eagerness; for my four-footed winged beast fans with his wings the smooth pathway of the air; and truly he will be glad to rest his knees in his stall at home. Exit \n \n ",
        "147":"I mourn your unfortunate fate, Prometheus.",
        "148":"Shedding from my eyes a coursing flood of tears I wet my tender cheeks with their moist streams. For Zeus, holding this unenviable power by self-appointed laws,",
        "149":"displays towards the gods of old an overweening spirit.\n ",
        "150":"Now the whole earth cries aloud in lamentation; . . . lament the greatness of the glory of your time-hallowed honor,",
        "151":"the honor that was yours and your brother’s; and all mortals who make their dwelling place in holy Asia share the anguish of your most lamentable suffering;\n ",
        "152":"And those who dwell in the land of Colchis , the maidens fearless in fight; and the Scythian multitude that inhabits the most remote region of the earth bordering the Maeotic lake;\n ",
        "153":"And the warlike flower of Arabia , which hold the high-cragged citadel near the Caucasus , a hostile host that roars among the sharp-pointed spears.\n ",
        "154":"One other Titan god before this I have seen in distress, enthralled in torment by adamantine bonds—Atlas, pre-eminent in mighty strength, who moans as he supports",
        "155":"the vault of heaven on his back. \n",
        "156":"The waves of the sea utter a cry as they fall, the deep laments, the black abyss of Hades rumbles in response, and the streams of pure-flowing rivers",
        "157":"lament your piteous pain.\n ",
        "158":"No, do not think it is from pride or even from wilfulness that I am silent. Painful thoughts devour my heart as I behold myself maltreated in this way. And yet who else but I definitely assigned",
        "159":"their prerogatives to these upstart gods? But I do not speak of this; for my tale would tell you nothing except what you know. Still, listen to the miseries that beset mankind—how they were witless before and I made them have sense and endowed them with reason.",
        "160":"I will not speak to upbraid mankind but to set forth the friendly purpose that inspired my blessing.\n First of all, though they had eyes to see, they saw to no avail; they had ears, but they did not understand ; but, just as shapes in dreams, throughout their length of days,",
        "161":"without purpose they wrought all things in confusion. They had neither knowledge of houses built of bricks and turned to face the sun nor yet of work in wood; but dwelt beneath the ground like swarming ants, in sunless caves. They had no sign either of winter",
        "162":"or of flowery spring or of fruitful summer, on which they could depend but managed everything without judgment, until I taught them to discern the risings of the stars and their settings, which are difficult to distinguish.\n Yes, and numbers, too, chiefest of sciences,",
        "163":"I invented for them, and the combining of letters, creative mother of the Muses’ arts, with which to hold all things in memory. I, too, first brought brute beasts beneath the yoke to be subject to the collar and the pack-saddle, so that they might bear in men’s stead their",
        "164":"heaviest burdens; and to the chariot I harnessed horses and made them obedient to the rein, to be an image of wealth and luxury. It was I and no one else who invented the mariner’s flaxen-winged car that roams the sea.\n Wretched that I am—such are the arts I devised",
        "165":"for mankind, yet have myself no cunning means to rid me of my present suffering.\n ",
        "166":"You have suffered sorrow and humiliation. You have lost your wits and have gone astray; and, like an unskilled doctor, fallen ill, you lose heart and cannot",
        "167":"discover by which remedies to cure your own disease.\n ",
        "168":"Hear the rest and you shall wonder the more at the arts and resources I devised. This first and foremost: if ever man fell ill, there was no defence—no healing food,",
        "169":"no ointment, nor any drink—but for lack of medicine they wasted away, until I showed them how to mix soothing remedies with which they now ward off all their disorders. And I marked out many ways by which they might read the future,",
        "170":"and among dreams I first discerned which are destined to come true; and voices baffling interpretation I explained to them, and signs from chance meetings. The flight of crook-taloned birds I distinguished clearly— which by nature are auspicious,",
        "171":"which sinister—their various modes of life, their mutual feuds and loves, and their consortings; and the smoothness of their entrails, and what color the gall must have to please",
        "172":"the gods, also the speckled symmetry of the liver-lobe; and the thigh-bones, wrapped in fat, and the long chine I burned and initiated mankind into an occult art. Also I cleared their vision to discern signs from flames,which were obscure before this.",
        "173":"Enough about these arts. Now as to the benefits to men that lay concealed beneath the earth—bronze, iron, silver, and gold—who would claim to have discovered them before me? No one, I know full well, unless he likes to babble idly.",
        "174":"Hear the sum of the whole matter in the compass of one brief word—every art possessed by man comes from Prometheus.\n ",
        "175":"Do not benefit mortals beyond reason and disregard your own distress; although, I am confident that you will be freed",
        "176":"from these bonds and will have power in no way inferior to Zeus.\n ",
        "177":"Not in this way is Fate, who brings all to fulfillment, destined to complete this course. Only when I have been bent by pangs and tortures infinite am I to escape my bondage. Skill is weaker by far than Necessity.\n ",
        "178":"Who then is the helmsman of Necessity?\n ",

        "364":"For nothing of this shall bend my will even to tell at whose hands he is fated to be hurled from his sovereignty.\n ",
        "365":"Look now whether this course seems to profit you.\n ",
        "366":"Long ago has this my course been foreseen and resolved.\n ",
        "367":"Bend your will, perverse fool, oh bend your will at last",
        "368":"to wisdom in face of your present sufferings.\n ",
        "369":"In vain you trouble me, as though it were a wave you try to persuade. Never think that, through terror at the will of Zeus, I shall become womanish and, with hands upturned, aping woman’s ways,",
        "370":"shall importune my greatly hated enemy to release me from these bonds. I am far, far from that.\n ",
        "371":"I think that by speaking much I will only speak in vain; for you are not soothed nor are you softened by my entreaties. You take the bit in your teeth like a new-harnessed",
        "372":"colt and struggle against the reins. Yet it is a paltry device that prompts your vehemence, for in the foolish-minded mere self-will of itself avails less than anything at all. But if you will not be won to belief by my words,",
        "373":"think of what a tempest and a towering wave of woe shall break upon you past escape. First, the Father will shatter this jagged cliff with thunder and lightning-flame, and will entomb your frame, while the rock shall still hold you clasped in its embrace.",
        "374":"But when you have completed a long stretch of time, you shall come back again to the light. Then indeed the winged hound of Zeus, the ravening eagle, coming an unbidden banqueter the whole day long, with savage appetite shall tear your body piecemeal into great rents and feast his fill",
        "375":"upon your liver until it is black with gnawing.\n Look for no term of this your agony until some god shall appear to take upon himself your woes and of his own free will descend into the sunless realm of Death and the dark deeps of Tartarus.\n \n ",
        "376":"Therefore be advised, since this is no counterfeited vaunting but utter truth; for the mouth of Zeus does not know how to utter falsehood, but will bring to pass every word. May you consider warily and reflect, and never deem",
        "377":"stubbornness better than wise counsel.\n ",
        "378":"To us, at least, Hermes seems not to speak untimely; for he bids you to lay aside your stubbornness and seek the good counsel of wisdom. Be advised! It is shameful for the wise to persist in error.\n ",
        "379":"No news to me, in truth, is the message this fellow has proclaimed so noisily.Yet for enemy to suffer ill from enemy is no disgrace. Therefore let the lightning’s forked curl be cast upon my head and let the sky",
        "380":"be convulsed with thunder and the wrack of savage winds; let the hurricane shake the earth from its rooted base, and let the waves of the sea mingle with their savage surge the courses",
        "381":"of the stars in heaven; and let him lift me on high and hurl me down to black Tartarus with the swirling floods of stern Necessity: do what he will, me he shall never bring to death.\n ",
        "382":"Such indeed are the thoughts and the words",
        "383":"one hears from men deranged. Where does his prayer fall short of raving? Where does he abate his frenzy?—But, at all events, may you who sympathize with his anguish,",
        "384":"withdraw in haste from this spot so that the relentless roar of the thunder does not stun your senses.\n ",
        "385":"Use some other strain and urge me to some other course in which you are likely to convince me. This utterance",
        "386":"in your flood of speech is, I think, past all endurance. How do you charge me to practise baseness? With him I am content to suffer any fate; for I have learned to detest traitors, and there is no pest",
        "387":"I abhor more than this.\n ",
        "388":"Well then, bear my warning in memory and do not blame your fortune when you are caught in the toils of calamity; nor ever say that it was Zeus who cast you",
        "389":"into suffering unforeseen. Not so, but blame yourselves. For well forewarned, and not suddenly or secretly shall you be entangled in the inextricable net of calamity by reason of your folly. Exit \n \n ",
        "390":"Indeed, now it has passed from word to deed—the earth rocks, the echoing thunder-peal from the depths rolls roaring past me; the fiery wreathed lightning-flashes flare forth, and whirlwinds toss the",
        "391":"swirling dust; the blasts of all the winds leap forth and set in hostile array their embattled strife; the sky is confounded with the deep. Behold, this stormy turmoil advances against me visibly,",
        "392":"sent by Zeus to frighten me. O holy mother mine, O you firmament that revolves the common light of all, you see the wrongs I suffer! Amid thunder and lightning Prometheus vanishes from sight; and with him disappear the daughters of Oceanus \n \n "
