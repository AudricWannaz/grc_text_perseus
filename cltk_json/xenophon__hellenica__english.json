There-upon they made offerings to the gods\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho avert evil and to those who grant safety, and having with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty obtained favourable omens, ceased sacrificing. And within\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfive days after the sacrifice was ended a man reported to the ephors\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta conspiracy, and Cinadon as the head of the affair. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t",
                "4":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This Cinadon was a young man, sturdy of body and stout of heart, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot one of the peers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd when the ephors asked how he had said that the plan would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcarried out, the informer replied that Cinadon had taken him to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedge of the market-place and directed him to count how many\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpartiatae there were in the market-place. And I, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the said, after counting king and ephors and senators and about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforty others, asked Why, Cinadon, did you bid me count these men? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd he replied: Believe, said he, that these men are your\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies, and that all the others who are in the market-place, more\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan four thousand in number, are your allies.

When he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas asked again at what time this thing was to be done, he said that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\torders had been given him to stay in the city. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t",
                "7":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Upon hearing these statements the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tephors came to the conclusion that he was describing a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twell-considered plan, and were greatly alarmed; and without even\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconvening the Little Assembly, as it was called, but merely\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgathering about them—one ephor here and another there—some of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsenators, they decided to send Cinadon to Aulon along with others of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe younger men, and to order him to bring back with him certain of the Aulonians and Helots\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhose names were written in the official dispatch.

And when Cinadon was brought back and questioned, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconfessed everything and told the names of his confederates, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tasked him finally what in the world was his object in undertaking\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis thing. He replied: I wished to be inferior to no one in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLacedaemon.

Then, however, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbarbarians charged. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t",
                "13":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t When they came to a hand-to-hand encounter, all of the Greeks who\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstruck anyone broke their spears, while the barbarians, being armed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith javelins of cornel-wood, speedily killed twelve men and two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thorses. Thereupon the Greeks were turned to flight. But when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAgesilaus came to the rescue with the hoplites, the barbarians\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twithdrew again and one of them was killed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t",
                "14":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t After this cavalry battle had taken\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplace and Agesilaus on the next day was offering sacrifices with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tview to an advance, the livers of the victims were found to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlacking a lobe. This sign having presented itself, he turned and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarched to the sea. And perceiving that, unless he obtained an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadequate cavalry force, he would not be able to campaign in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplains, he resolved that this must be provided, so that he might not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave to carry on a skulking warfare. Accordingly he assigned the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trichest men of all the cities in that region to the duty of raising\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thorses; and by proclaiming that whoever supplied a horse and arms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand a competent man would not have to serve himself, he caused these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarrangements to be carried out with all the expedition that was to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe expected when men were eagerly looking for substitutes to die in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir stead. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Thus the soldiers, seeing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat these men were white-skinned because they never were without\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir clothing, and soft and unused to toil because they always rode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin carriages, came to the conclusion that the war would be in no way\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent from having to fight with women. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t",

And not only was much other property captured, which fetched\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore than seventy talents, but it was at this time that the camels\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso were captured which Agesilaus brought back with him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGreece. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t",
