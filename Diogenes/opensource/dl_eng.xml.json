Hence\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPlato, comparing him to Aristotle, said, \"The one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneeded a spur, the other a bridle.\" And again,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"See what an ass I am training and what a horse\n\t\t\t\t\t\the has to run against.\" However, Xenocrates was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin all besides dignified and grave of demeanour,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich made Plato say to him continually, \"Xenocrates, sacrifice to the Graces.\" He spent most of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this time in the Academy; and whenever he was going\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto betake himself to the city, it is said that all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnoisy rabble and hired porters made way for him as\n\t\t\t\t\t\the passed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd that once the notorious Phryne\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttried to make his acquaintance and, as if she were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing chased by some people, took refuge under his\n\t\t\t\t\t\troof; that he admitted her out of ordinary humanity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, there being but one small couch in the room,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpermitted her to share it with him, and at last, after\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tmany importunities, she retired without success,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttelling those who inquired that he whom she quitted\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas not a man but a statue. Another version of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstory is that his pupils induced Las to invade his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcouch; and that so great was his endurance that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany times submitted to amputation and cautery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHis words were entirely worthy of credit, so much\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso that, although it was illegal for witnesses to give\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevidence unsworn, the Athenians allowed Xenocrates\n\t\t\t\t\t\talone to do so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFurthermore, he was extremely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent; at all events, when Alexander sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim a large sum of money, he took three thousand\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAttic drachmas and sent back the rest to Alexander,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhose needs, he said, were greater than his own,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he had a greater number of people to keep.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAgain, he would not accept the present sent him by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntipater, as Myronianus attests in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd when he had been honoured at the court of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDionysius with a golden crown as the prize for his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprowess in drinking at the Feast of Pitchers, he went\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout and placed it on the statue of Hermes just as\n\t\t\t\t\t\the had been accustomed to place there garlands of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflowers. There is a story that, when he was sent,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talong with others also, on an embassy to Philip, his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolleagues, being bribed, accepted Philip's invitations to feasts and talked with him. Xenocrates\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid neither the one nor the other. Indeed on this\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount Philip declined to see him. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHence, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe envoys returned to Athens, they complained\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Xenocrates had accompanied them without\n\t\t\t\t\t\trendering any service.

And afterwards Philip said that,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof all who had arrived at his court, Xenocrates was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe only man whom he could not bribe. Moreover,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen he went as envoy to Antipater to plead for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAthenians taken prisoners in the Lamian war,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvited to dine with Antipater, he quoted to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe following lines:"}, "O Circe! what righteous man would have the heart to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaste meat and drink ere he had redeemed his company and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeheld them face to face?", "and so pleased Antipater with his ready wit that he\n\t\t\t\t\tat once released them.", "When a little sparrow was pursued by a hawk and\n\t\t\t\t\t\trushed into his bosom, he stroked it and let it go,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclaring that a suppliant must not be betrayed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen bantered by Bion, he said he would make no\n\t\t\t\t\t\treply.

The price agreed upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the making of the statue itself has been paid to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPraxiteles, but the rest of the cost should be defrayed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the source above mentioned. The statue should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe set up in whatever place seems desirable to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\texecutors entrusted with carrying out my other\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttestamentary dispositions. Let all that concerns the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttemple and the offerings set up be arranged in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanner. The estate at Stagira belonging to me I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgive and bequeath to Callinus. The whole of my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlibrary I give to Neleus. The garden and the walk\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the houses adjoining the garden, all and sundry,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI give and bequeath to such of my friends hereinafter named as may wish to study literature and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy there in common,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince it is not possible\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor all men to be always in residence, on condition\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat no one alienates the property or devotes it to\n\t\t\t\t\t\this private use, but so that they hold it like a temple\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin joint possession and live, as is right and proper,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton terms of familiarity and friendship. Let the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommunity consist of Hipparchus, Neleus, Strato,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCallinus, Demotimus, Demaratus, Callisthenes,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMelantes, Pancreon, Nicippus.

Pompylus and Threpta have long been\n\t\t\t\t\t\temancipated and have done me much service; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think that 2000 drachmas certainly ought to belong\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto them from previous payments made to them by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme, from their own earnings, and my present bequest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto them to be paid by Hipparchus, as I stated many\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttimes in conversation with Melantes and Pancreon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, who agreed with me. I give and bequeath to them the maidservant Somatale. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmy slaves I at once emancipate Molon and Timon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Parmeno; to Manes and Callias I give their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom on condition that they stay four years in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgarden and work there together and that their conduct is free from blame. Of my household furniture\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlet so much as the executors think right be given to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompylus and let the rest be sold. I also devise\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarion to Demotimus, and Donax to Neleus. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEuboeus must be sold. Let Hipparchus pay to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCallinus 3000 drachmas. And if I had not seen that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHipparchus had done great service to Melantes and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPancreon and formerly to me, and that now in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate affairs he has made shipwreck, I would have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappointed him jointly with Melantes and Pancreon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto carry out my wishes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut, since I saw that it\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\twas not easy for them to share the management\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith him, and I thought it more advantageous for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem to receive a fixed sum from Hipparchus, let\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHipparchus pay Melantes and Pancreon one talent\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach and let Hipparchus provide funds for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\texecutors to defray the expenses set down in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill, as each disbursement falls due. And when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHipparchus shall have carried out all these injunctions, he shall be released in full from his liabilities\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto me. And any advance that he has made in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChalcis in my name belongs to him alone. Let\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHipparchus, Neleus, Strato, Callinus, Demotimus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCallisthenes and Ctesarchus be executors to carry out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe terms of the will. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOne copy of the will, sealed\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the signet-ring of Theophrastus, is deposited\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Hegesias, the son of Hipparchus, the witnesses\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing Callippus of Pallene, Philomelus of Euonymaea,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLysander of Hyba, and Philo of Alopece.

What Chrysippus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmakes of it is not to be found in Polemo nor Hypsicrates, no, nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven in Antigonus. It is his own invention.

He reduces nearly everything to exhalation from the sea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis process is the upward path. Exhalations arise from earth as\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell as from sea ; those from sea are bright and pure, those from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearth dark. Fire is fed by the bright exhalations, the moist element\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the others. He does not make clear the nature of the surrounding\n\t\t\t\t\t\telement. He says, however, that there are in it bowls with their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcavities turned towards us, in which the bright exhalations\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollect and produce flames. These are the stars. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe flame of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsun is the brightest and the hottest ; the other stars are further\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the earth and for that reason give it less light and heat. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoon, which is nearer to the earth, traverses a region which is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpure. The sun, however, moves in a clear and untroubled region, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkeeps a proportionate distance from us. That is why it gives us more\n\t\t\t\t\t\theat and light. Eclipses of the sun and moon occur when the bowls\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare turned upwards ; the monthly phases of the moon are due to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbowl turning round in its place little by little. Day and night,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonths, seasons and years, rains and winds and other similar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tphenomena are accounted for by the various exhalations. Thus the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbright exhalation, set aflame in the hollow orb of the sun, produces\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday, the opposite exhalation when it has\n\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\tgot\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe mastery causes night ; the increase of warmth due to the bright\n\t\t\t\t\t\texhalation produces summer, whereas the preponderance of moisture\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdue to the dark exhalation brings about winter. His explanations of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother phenomena are in harmony with this. He gives no account of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnature of the earth, nor even of the bowls.
