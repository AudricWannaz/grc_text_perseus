It is therefore evident that, while all partnerships aim at some\n\t\t\t\t\tgood the partnership that is the most supreme of all and includes all the others\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes so most of all, and aims at the most supreme of all goods; and this is the\n\t\t\t\t\tpartnership entitled the state, the political association. Those then who think that the natures of the\n\t\t\t\t\tstatesman, the royal ruler, the head of an estate and the master of a family are the same,\n\t\t\t\t\tare mistaken they imagine that the difference between these various\n\t\t\t\t\tforms of authority is one of greater and smaller numbers, not a difference in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe kindthat is, that the ruler over a few people is a master, over\n\t\t\t\t\tmore the head of an estate, over more still a statesman or royal ruler, as if\n\t\t\t\t\tthere were no difference between a large household and a small city; and also as\n\t\t\t\t\tto the statesman and the royal ruler, they think that one who governs as sole\n\t\t\t\t\thead is royal, and one who, while the government follows the principles of the\n\t\t\t\t\tscience of royalty, takes turns to govern and be governed is a statesman; but\n\t\t\t\t\tthese views are not true. And a proof that these people are mistaken will appear if we examine the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion in accordance with our regular method of investigation. In every other\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter it is necessary to analyze the composite whole down to its uncompounded\n\t\t\t\t\telements for these are the smallest parts of the whole; so too with the state, by\n\t\t\t\t\texamining the elements of which it is composed we shall better discern in\n\t\t\t\t\trelation to these different kinds of rulers what is the difference between them,\n\t\t\t\t\tand whether it is possible to obtain any scientific precision in regard to the\n\t\t\t\t\tvarious statements made above.In this subject as\n\t\t\t\t\tin others the best method of investigation is to study things in the process of\n\t\t\t\t\tdevelopment from the beginning. The\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst coupling together of persons then to which necessity gives rise is that\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween those who are unable to exist without one another: for instance the\n\t\t\t\t\tunion of female and male for the continuance of the species and this\n\t\t\t\t\tnot of deliberate purpose, but with man as with the other animals and with\n\t\t\t\t\tplants there is a natural instinct to desire to leave behind one another being\n\t\t\t\t\tof the same sort as oneself; and the union of natural ruler and\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural subject for the sake of security for he that can foresee with\n\t\t\t\t\this mind is naturally ruler and naturally master, and he that can do these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings with his body is\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject and naturally a slave; so that master and slave have the same\n\t\t\t\t\tinterest. Thus\n\t\t\t\t\tthe female and the slave are by nature distinct for nature makes\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing as the cutlers make the Delphic knife, in a niggardly way, but one thing for one purpose; for so each\n\t\t\t\t\ttool will be turned out in the finest perfection, if it serves not many uses but\n\t\t\t\t\tone. Yet among barbarians the female and the slave have the same rank;\n\t\t\t\t\tand the cause of this is that barbarians have no class of natural rulers, but\n\t\t\t\t\twith them the conjugal partnership is a partnership of female slave and male\n\t\t\t\t\tslave. Hence the saying of the poets  implying that barbarian and slave are the same in nature. From these two partnerships then is first\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed the household, and Hesiod was right when he wrote\n\t\t\t\t\t\t for the ox serves instead of a servant for the poor. The partnership\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore that comes about in the course of nature for everyday purposes is the\n\t\t\t\t\thouse, the persons whom Charondas speaks of as\n\t\t\t\t\tmeal-tub-fellows and the Cretan Epimenides as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanger-fellows.\n\t\t\t\t\tOn\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other hand the primary partnership made up of several households for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsatisfaction of not mere daily needs is the village. The village according to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe most natural account seems to be a colony from a household, formed\n\t\t\t\t\tof those whom some people speak of as fellow-sucklings,\n\t\t\t\t\tsons and sons' sons. It is owing to this that our cities were at first under royal\n\t\t\t\t\tsway and that foreign races are so still,because they were made up of parts that were under royal rule;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor every household is under the royal rule of its eldest member, so that the\n\t\t\t\t\tcolonies from the household were so too, because of the kinship of their\n\t\t\t\t\tmembers. And this is what Homer\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans:  for his Cyclopes live in scattered families; and that is the way in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich people used to live in early times. Also this explains why all races speak\n\t\t\t\t\tof the gods as ruled by a king, because they themselves too are some of them\n\t\t\t\t\tactually now so ruled and in other cases used to be of old; and as men imagine\n\t\t\t\t\tthe gods in human form, so also they suppose their manner of life to be like\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir own. The partnership finally composed of several villages is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcity-state; it has at last attained the limit of virtually complete\n\t\t\t\t\tself-sufficiency, and thus, while it comes into existence for the sake of life,\n\t\t\t\t\tit exists for the good life. Hence every city-state exists by nature, inasmuch\n\t\t\t\t\tas the first partnerships so exist; for the city-state is the end of the other\n\t\t\t\t\tpartnerships, and nature is an end, since that which each thing is when its\n\t\t\t\t\tgrowth is completed we speak of as being the nature of each thing, for instance\n\t\t\t\t\tof a man, a horse, a household. Again, the object for which a thing exists, its\n\t\t\t\t\tend, is its chief good; and self-sufficiency is an end, and a chief good.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom these things therefore it\n\t\t\t\t\tis clear that the city-state is a natural growth, and that man is by nature a\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical animal, and a man that is by nature and not merely by fortune citiless\n\t\t\t\t\tis either low in the scale of humanity or above it like the  man reviled by Homer, for one by nature unsocial is also a\n\t\t\t\t\tlover of war inasmuch as he is solitary, like an isolated\n\t\t\t\t\tpiece at draughts. And why man is a\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical animal in a greater measure than any bee or any gregarious animal is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear. For nature, as we declare, does nothing without purpose; and man alone of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe animals possesses speech. The mere voice, it is true, can indicate pain and\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure, and therefore is possessed by the other animals as well for\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir nature has been developed so far as to have sensations of what is painful\n\t\t\t\t\tand pleasant and to indicate those sensations to one another, but\n\t\t\t\t\tspeech is designed to indicate the advantageous and the harmful, and therefore\n\t\t\t\t\talso the right and the wrong; for\n\t\t\t\t\tit is the special property of man in distinction from the other animals that he\n\t\t\t\t\talone has perception of good and bad and right and wrong and the other moral\n\t\t\t\t\tqualities, and it is partnership in these things that makes a household and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity-state.Thus also the city-state is prior\n\t\t\t\t\tin nature to the household and to each of us individually.For the whole must necessarily be prior to the\n\t\t\t\t\tpart; since when the whole body is destroyed, foot or hand will not exist except\n\t\t\t\t\tin an equivocal sense, like the sense in which one speaks of a hand sculptured\n\t\t\t\t\tin stone as a hand; because a hand in those circumstances will be a hand\n\t\t\t\t\tspoiled, and all things are defined by their function and capacity, so that when\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are no longer such as to perform their function they must not be said to be\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same things, but to bear their names in an equivocal sense. It is clear therefore that the state is\n\t\t\t\t\talso prior by nature to the individual; for if each individual when separate is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot self-sufficient, he must be related to the whole state as other parts are to\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir whole, while a man who is incapable of entering into partnership, or who\n\t\t\t\t\tis so self-sufficing that he has no need to do so, is no part of a state, so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he must be either a lower animal or a god.Therefore the impulse to form a partnership of this kind is present in all men\n\t\t\t\t\tby nature; but the man who first united people in such a partnership was the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatest of benefactors. For as man is the best of the animals when perfected,\n\t\t\t\t\tso he is the worst of all when sundered from law and justice. For\n\t\t\t\t\tunrighteousness is most pernicious when possessed of weapons, and man is born\n\t\t\t\t\tpossessing weapons for the use of wisdom and virtue, which it is possible to\n\t\t\t\t\temploy entirely for the opposite ends. Hence when devoid of virtue man is the\n\t\t\t\t\tmost unholy and savage of animals, and the worst in regard to sexual indulgence\n\t\t\t\t\tand gluttony. Justice on the other hand is an element of the state; for judicial\n\t\t\t\t\tprocedure, which means the decision of what is just, is the regulation of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical partnership. And now that it is clear what are the\n\t\t\t\t\tcomponent parts of the state, we have first of all to discuss household\n\t\t\t\t\tmanagement; for every state is composed of households. Household management\n\t\t\t\t\tfalls into departments corresponding to the parts of which the household in its\n\t\t\t\t\tturn is composed; and the household in its perfect form consists of slaves and\n\t\t\t\t\tfreemen. The investigation of everything should begin with its smallest parts,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the primary and smallest parts of the household are master and slave,\n\t\t\t\t\thusband and wife, father and children; we ought therefore to examine the proper\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution and character of each of these three relationships, I mean that of mastership, that of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarriage there is no\n\t\t\t\t\texact term denoting the relation uniting wife and husband, and thirdly\n\t\t\t\t\tthe progenitive relationship this too has not been designated by a\n\t\t\t\t\tspecial name. Let us then accept these three relationships that we\n\t\t\t\t\thave mentioned. There is also a department which some people consider the same\n\t\t\t\t\tas household management and others the most important part of it, and the true\n\t\t\t\t\tposition of which we shall have to consider: I mean what is called the art of\n\t\t\t\t\tgetting wealth.\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us begin by discussing the relation of master\n\t\t\t\t\tand slave, in order to observe the facts that have a bearing on practical\n\t\t\t\t\tutility, and also in the hope that we may be able to obtain something better\n\t\t\t\t\tthan the notions at present entertained, with a view to a theoretic knowledge of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subject. For some thinkers hold\n\t\t\t\t\tthe function of the master to be a definite science, and moreover think that\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold management, mastership, statesmanship and monarchy are the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthing,as we said at the beginning\n\t\t\t\t\tof the treatise; others however maintain that for one man to be another man's\n\t\t\t\t\tmaster is contrary to nature, because it is only convention that makes the one a\n\t\t\t\t\tslave and the other a freeman and there is no difference between them by nature,\n\t\t\t\t\tand that therefore it is unjust, for it is based on force.Since therefore property is a part of a household and the art\n\t\t\t\t\tof acquiring property a part of household management for without the\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessaries even life, as well as the good life, is impossible, and since, just as for the particular arts it would be\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary for the proper tools to be forthcoming if their work is to be\n\t\t\t\t\taccomplished, so also the manager of a household must have his tools, and of\n\t\t\t\t\ttools some are lifeless and others living for example, for a helmsman\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rudder is a lifeless tool and the look-out man a live toolfor an\n\t\t\t\t\tassistant in the arts belongs to the class of tools, so also an\n\t\t\t\t\tarticle of property is a tool for the purpose of life, and property generally is\n\t\t\t\t\ta collection of tools, and a slave is a live article of property. And every assistant is as it were a tool\n\t\t\t\t\tthat serves for several tools; for if every tool could perform its own work when\n\t\t\t\t\tordered, or by seeing what to do in advance, like the statues of Daedalus in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstory, or the\n\t\t\t\t\ttripods of Hephaestus which the poet says enter self-moved the\n\t\t\t\t\tcompany divine,if thus shuttles wove and quills played harps of themselves,\n\t\t\t\t\tmaster-craftsmen would have no need of assistants and masters no need of slaves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow the tools mentioned are instruments of production, whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tan article of property is an instrument of action; for from a shuttle we get something else beside the\n\t\t\t\t\tmere use of the shuttle, but from a garment or a bed we get only their use.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd also inasmuch as there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference in kind between production and action, and both need tools, it\n\t\t\t\t\tfollows that those tools also must possess the same difference. But life is\n\t\t\t\t\tdoing things, not making things; hence the slave is an assistant in the class of\n\t\t\t\t\tinstruments of action.And the term\n\t\t\t\t\tarticle of property is used in the same way as the term\n\t\t\t\t\tpart: a thing that is a part is not only a part of another\n\t\t\t\t\tthing but absolutely belongs to another thing, and so also does an article of\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty. Hence whereas the master is merely the slave's master and does not\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to the slave, the slave is not merely the slave of the master but wholly\n\t\t\t\t\tbelongs to the master. These\n\t\t\t\t\tconsiderations therefore make clear the nature of the slave and his essential\n\t\t\t\t\tquality: one who is a human being belonging by nature not to himself but to\n\t\t\t\t\tanother is by nature a slave, and a person is a human being belonging to another\n\t\t\t\t\tif being a man he is an article of property, and an article of property\n\t\t\t\t\tis an instrument for action separable from its owner. But we must next consider\n\t\t\t\t\twhether or not anyone exists who is by nature of this character, and whether it\n\t\t\t\t\tis advantageous and just for anyone to be a slave, or whether on the contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tall slavery is against nature.And it is not difficult either\n\t\t\t\t\tto discern the answer by theory or to learn it empirically. Authority and\n\t\t\t\t\tsubordination are conditions not only inevitable but also expedient; in some\n\t\t\t\t\tcases things are marked out from the moment of birth to rule or to be ruled. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are many varieties both of rulers and of subjects and the higher\n\t\t\t\t\tthe type of the subjects, the loftier is the nature of the authority exercised\n\t\t\t\t\tover them, for example to control a human being is a higher thing than to tame a\n\t\t\t\t\twild beast; for the higher the type of the parties to the performance of a\n\t\t\t\t\tfunction, the higher is the function, and when one party rules and another is\n\t\t\t\t\truled, there is a function performed between thembecause in every composite thing, where a\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality of parts, whether continuous or discrete, is combined to make a single\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon whole, there is always found a ruling and a subject factor, and this\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristic of living things is present in them as an outcome of the whole of\n\t\t\t\t\tnature, since even in things that do not partake of life there is a ruling\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple, as in the case of a musical scale. However, this matter perhaps belongs to an investigation\n\t\t\t\t\tlying somewhat outside our subject; but an animal consists primarily of soul and body, of which the former is by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature the ruling and the latter the subject factor. And to discover what is\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural we must study it preferably in things that are in a natural state, and\n\t\t\t\t\tnot in specimens that are degenerate. Hence in studying man we must consider a\n\t\t\t\t\tman that is in the best possible condition in regard to both body and soul, and\n\t\t\t\t\tin him the principle stated will clearly appear, since in those\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are bad or in a bad condition it might be thought that the body often rules\n\t\t\t\t\tthe soul because of its vicious and unnatural condition. But to resumeit is in a living creature,\n\t\t\t\t\tas we say, that it is first possible to discern the rule both of master and of\n\t\t\t\t\tstatesman the soul rules the body with the sway of a master, the intelligence\n\t\t\t\t\trules the appetites with that of a statesman or a king and in these examples it\n\t\t\t\t\tis manifest that it is natural and expedient for the body to be governed by the\n\t\t\t\t\tsoul and for the emotional part to be governed by the intellect, the part\n\t\t\t\t\tpossessing reason, whereas for the two parties to be on an equal footing or in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe contrary positions is harmful in all cases. Again, the same holds good between man and the other\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals: tame animals are superior in their nature to wild animals, yet for all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe former it is advantageous to be ruled by man, since this gives them\n\t\t\t\t\tsecurity. Again, as between the sexes, the male is by nature superior and the\n\t\t\t\t\tfemale inferior, the male ruler and the female subject. And the same must also\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily apply in the case of mankind as a whole; therefore all men that differ as widely as the soul does\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the body and the human being from the lower animal and this is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe condition of those whose function is the use of the body and from whom this\n\t\t\t\t\tis the best that is forthcoming these are by nature slaves, for whom\n\t\t\t\t\tto be governed by this kind of authorityis advantageous, inasmuch as it is advantageous to the subject\n\t\t\t\t\tthings already mentioned. For he is by nature a slave who is capable of\n\t\t\t\t\tbelonging to another and that is why he does so belong, and\n\t\t\t\t\twho participates in reason so far as to apprehend it but not to possess it; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe animals other than man are subservient not to reason, by apprehending it,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut to feelings. And also the\n\t\t\t\t\tusefulness of slaves diverges little from that of animals; bodily service for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe necessities of life is forthcoming from both, from slaves and from domestic\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals alike. The intention of nature therefore is to make the bodies also of\n\t\t\t\t\tfreemen and of slaves differentthe latter strong for necessary\n\t\t\t\t\tservice, the former erect and unserviceable for such occupations, but\n\t\t\t\t\tserviceable for a life of citizenship and that again divides into the\n\t\t\t\t\temployments of war and those of peace; but as a matter of fact often\n\t\t\t\t\tthe very opposite comes aboutsome persons have the bodies of free men\n\t\t\t\t\tand others the souls; since this is\n\t\t\t\t\tcertainly clear, that if persons were born as distinguished only in body as are\n\t\t\t\t\tthe statues of the gods, everyone would say that those who were inferior\n\t\t\t\t\tdeserved to be these men's slaves. And if this is true in the case of the body,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is far juster reason for this rule being laid down in the case of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsoul; but beauty of soul is not so easy to see as beauty of body. It is\n\t\t\t\t\tmanifest therefore that there are cases of people of whom some are freemen and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe others slaves by nature, and for these slavery is an institution both\n\t\t\t\t\texpedient and just. But at the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime it is not difficult to see that those who assert the opposite are also\n\t\t\t\t\tright in a manner. The fact is that the terms slavery and\n\t\t\t\t\tslave are ambiguous; for there is also such a thing as a\n\t\t\t\t\tslave or a man that is in slavery by law, for the law is a sort of agreement\n\t\t\t\t\tunder which the things conquered in war are said to belong to their conquerors.\n\t\t\t\t\tNow this conventional right is arraigned by many jurists just as a statesman is\n\t\t\t\t\timpeached for proposing an unconstitutional measure; they say that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tmonstrous if the person powerful enough to use force, and superior in power, is\n\t\t\t\t\tto have the victim of his force as his slave and subject; and even among the\n\t\t\t\t\tlearned some hold this view, though others hold the other. But the reason of this dispute and what makes the\n\t\t\t\t\ttheories overlap is the fact that in a certain manner virtue when it obtains\n\t\t\t\t\tresources has in fact very great power to use force, and the stronger party\n\t\t\t\t\talways possesses superiority in something that is good, so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is thought that force cannot be devoid of goodness, but that the dispute\n\t\t\t\t\tis merely about the justice of the matter for it is due to the one\n\t\t\t\t\tparty holding that the justification of authority is good-will, while the other\n\t\t\t\t\tidentifies justice with the mere rule of the stronger; because\n\t\t\t\t\tobviously if these theories be separated apart,the other theories have no force or plausibility at all,\n\t\t\t\t\timplying that the superior in goodness has no claim to rule and be master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut some persons, simply\n\t\t\t\t\tclinging, as they think, to principle of justice for the law is a\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple of justice, assert that the enslavement of prisoners of war\n\t\t\t\t\tis just; yet at the same time they deny the assertion, for there is the\n\t\t\t\t\tpossibility that wars may be unjust in their origin and one would by no means\n\t\t\t\t\tadmit that a man that does not deserve slavery can be really a\n\t\t\t\t\tslaveotherwise we shall have the result that persons reputed of the\n\t\t\t\t\thighest nobility are slaves and the descendants of slaves if they happen to be\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken prisoners of war and sold. Therefore they do not mean to assert that\n\t\t\t\t\tGreeks themselves if taken prisoners are slaves, but that barbarians are. Yet\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they say this, they are merely seeking for the principles of natural\n\t\t\t\t\tslavery of which we spoke at the outset; for they are compelled to say that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere exist certain persons who are essentially slaves everywhere and certain\n\t\t\t\t\tothers who are so nowhere. And the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame applies also about nobility: our nobles consider themselves noble not only\n\t\t\t\t\tin their own country but everywhere, but they think that barbarian noblemen are\n\t\t\t\t\tonly noble in their own countrywhich implies that there are two kinds\n\t\t\t\t\tof nobility and of freedom, one absolute and the other relative, as Helen says\n\t\t\t\t\tin Theodectes:  Yet in so speaking they make nothing but virtue and vice the\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinction between slave and free, the noble and the base-born; for they\n\t\t\t\t\tassume that just as from a man springs a man and from brutes a brute, so also\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom good parents comes a good son but as a matter of fact nature frequently\n\t\t\t\t\twhile intending to do this is unable to bring it about.It is clear therefore that there is some reason for this\n\t\t\t\t\tdispute, and that in some instances it is not the case that one set are slaves\n\t\t\t\t\tand the other freemen by nature; and also that in some instances such a distinction does exist, when slavery\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the one and mastership for the other are advantageous and just, and it is\n\t\t\t\t\tproper for the one party to be governed and for the other to govern by the form\n\t\t\t\t\tof government for which they are by nature fitted, and therefore by the exercise\n\t\t\t\t\tof mastership, while to govern badly is to govern disadvantageously for both\n\t\t\t\t\tparties for the same thing is advantageous for a part and for the\n\t\t\t\t\twhole body or the whole soul, and the slave is a part of the masterhe\n\t\t\t\t\tis, as it were, a part of the body, alive but yet separated from it; hence there is a certain community of\n\t\t\t\t\tinterest and friendship between slave and master in cases when they have been\n\t\t\t\t\tqualified by nature for those positions, although when they do not hold them in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat way but by law and by constraint of force the opposite is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase.And even from these\n\t\t\t\t\tconsiderations it is clear that the authority of a master over slaves is not the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame as the authority of a magistrate in a republic, nor are all forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment the same, as some assert. Republican government controls men who are\n\t\t\t\t\tby nature free, the master's authority men who are by nature slaves; and the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment of a household is monarchy since every house is governed by\n\t\t\t\t\ta single ruler,whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tstatesmanship is the government of men free and equal. The term master therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tdenotes the possession not of a certain branch of knowledge but of a certain\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter, and similarly also the terms slave and\n\t\t\t\t\tfreeman. Yet there might be a science of mastership and a\n\t\t\t\t\tslave's sciencethe latter being the sort of knowledge that used to be\n\t\t\t\t\timparted by the professor at  for there used to be a man there who for a\n\t\t\t\t\tfee gave lessons to servants in their ordinary duties; and indeed\n\t\t\t\t\tthere might be more advanced scientific study of such matters, for instance a\n\t\t\t\t\tscience of cookery and the other such kinds of domestic servicefor\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent servants have different functions, some more honorable and some more\n\t\t\t\t\tmenial, and as the proverb says, \n\t\t\t\t\tThe slave's sciences then are all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe various branches of domestic work; the master's science is the science of\n\t\t\t\t\temploying slavesfor the master's function consists not in acquiring\n\t\t\t\t\tslaves but in employing them. This science however is one of no particular\n\t\t\t\t\timportance or dignity: the master must know how to direct the tasks which the\n\t\t\t\t\tslave must know how to execute. Therefore all people rich enough to be able to\n\t\t\t\t\tavoid personal trouble have a steward who takes this office, while they\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves engage in politics or philosophy. The science of acquiring slaves is\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent both from their ownership and their directionthat is, the\n\t\t\t\t\tjust acquiring of slaves, which is akin to the art of war or that of the chase.\n\t\t\t\t\tLet this then stand as our definition of slave and master. But let us follow our normal method and investigate\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally the nature of all kinds of property and the art of getting wealth,\n\t\t\t\t\tinasmuch as we saw the slave to be one division of property. In the first place\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore one might raise the question whether the art of getting wealth is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame as that of household management, or a part of it, or subsidiary to it; and\n\t\t\t\t\tif subsidiary, whether it is so in the sense in which the art of making shuttles\n\t\t\t\t\tis subsidiary to the art of weaving or in that in which the art of casting\n\t\t\t\t\tbronze is subsidiary to the making of statues for the two are not\n\t\t\t\t\tsubsidiary in the same way, but shuttle-making supplies tools whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tbronze-founding supplies materialand by material I mean the substance\n\t\t\t\t\tout of which certain work is produced, for example fleeces are material for a\n\t\t\t\t\tweaver and bronze for a statuary. Now it is clear that wealth-getting is not the same art as\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold management, for the function of the former is to provide and that of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe latter to usefor what will be the art that will use the contents\n\t\t\t\t\tof the house if not the art of household management? but whether wealth-getting\n\t\t\t\t\tis a part of the art of household management, or a different sort of science, is\n\t\t\t\t\topen to debate. For if it is the function of the getter of wealth to study the\n\t\t\t\t\tsource from which money and property are to be procured, . . . But property and riches comprise many divisions; hence first\n\t\t\t\t\tof all is husbandry a division of the household art, or is it a different kind\n\t\t\t\t\tof science? and so in general of the superintendence and acquisition of articles\n\t\t\t\t\tof food. But furthermore, there are\n\t\t\t\t\tmany sorts of food,owing to which\n\t\t\t\t\tboth animals and men have many modes of life; for it is impossible to live\n\t\t\t\t\twithout food, so that the differences of food have made the lives of animals\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent. Among wild animals some are nomadic and others solitary, according to\n\t\t\t\t\twhichever habit is advantageous for their supply of food, because some of them\n\t\t\t\t\tare carnivorous, others graminivorous, and others eat all kinds of food; so that\n\t\t\t\t\tnature has differentiated their modes of life to suit their facilities and their\n\t\t\t\t\tpredilection for those articles of food. And as different kinds of animals by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature relish different sorts of food, and not each kind the same, even within\n\t\t\t\t\tthe classes of carnivorous and graminivorous animals their modes of life differ\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom one another. And similarly in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe human race also, for there are wide differences of life among mankind. The\n\t\t\t\t\tidlest men are nomads for to procure food from domesticated animals\n\t\t\t\t\tinvolves no toil or industry, but as it is necessary for the herds to move from\n\t\t\t\t\tplace to place because of the pastures, the people themselves are forced to\n\t\t\t\t\tfollow along with them, as though they were farming a live farm. Other\n\t\t\t\t\tmen live from hunting, and different people from different kinds of hunting, for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance some from brigandage, others from fishingthese are those that\n\t\t\t\t\tdwell on the banks of lakes, marshes and rivers or of a sea suitable for\n\t\t\t\t\tfishing,and others live on wild birds and animals. But the largest\n\t\t\t\t\tclass of men live from the land and the fruits of cultivation. This then virtually completes the list of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe various modes of life, those at least that have their industry sprung from\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves and do not procure their food by barter and trade\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe lives of the herdsman, the brigand, the fisherman, the\n\t\t\t\t\thunter, the husband-man. Others also live pleasantly by combining some of these\n\t\t\t\t\tpursuits, supplementing the more deficient life where it happens to fall short\n\t\t\t\t\tin regard to being self-sufficing: for instance, some combine a pastoral life\n\t\t\t\t\tand brigandage, others husbandry and hunting, and similarly with the\n\t\t\t\t\tothersthey pass their time in such a combination of pursuits as their\n\t\t\t\t\tneed compels. Property of this sort\n\t\t\t\t\tthen seems to be bestowed by nature herself upon all, as immediately upon their\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst coming into existence, so also when they have reached maturity. For even\n\t\t\t\t\tat the original coming into existence of the young some kinds of animals bring\n\t\t\t\t\tforth with them at birth enough sustenance to suffice until the offspring can\n\t\t\t\t\tprovide for itself, for example all the species that bear their young in the\n\t\t\t\t\tform of larvae or in eggs. The viviparous species have sustenance for their\n\t\t\t\t\toffspring inside themselves for a certain period, the substance called milk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo that clearly we must suppose\n\t\t\t\t\tthat nature also provides for them in a similar way when grown up, and that\n\t\t\t\t\tplants exist for the sake of animals and the other animals for the good of man,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe domestic species both for his service and for his food, and if not all at\n\t\t\t\t\tall events most of the wild ones for the sake of his food and of his supplies of\n\t\t\t\t\tother kinds, in order thatthey may\n\t\t\t\t\tfurnish him both with clothing and with other appliances. If therefore nature\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes nothing without purpose or in vain, it follows that nature has made all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe animals for the sake of men. Hence even the art of war will by nature be in a manner an art of acquisition\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the art of hunting is a part of it that is properly\n\t\t\t\t\temployed both against wild animals and against such of mankind as though\n\t\t\t\t\tdesigned by nature for subjection refuse to submit to it, inasmuch as this\n\t\t\t\t\twarfare is by nature just.One kind of acquisition\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore in the order of nature is a part of the household art, in accordance with\n\t\t\t\t\twhich either there must be forthcoming or else that art must procure to be\n\t\t\t\t\tforthcoming a supply of those goods, capable of accumulation, which are\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary for life and useful for the community of city or household. And it is of these goods that riches in the\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue sense at all events seem to consist. For the amount of such property\n\t\t\t\t\tsufficient in itself for a good life is not unlimited, as Solon  says that it is in the verse  for a limit has been fixed, as with the other arts, since no tool\n\t\t\t\t\tbelonging to any art is without a limit whether in number or in size, and riches\n\t\t\t\t\tare a collection of tools for the householder and the statesman. Therefore that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is a certain art of acquisition belonging in the order of nature to\n\t\t\t\t\thouseholders and to statesmen, and for what reason this is so, is clear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut there is another kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tacquisition that is specially called wealth-getting, and that is so called with\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice and to this kind it is due that there is thought to be no limit to\n\t\t\t\t\triches and property. Owing to its affinity to the art of acquisition of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we spoke, it is supposed by many people to be one and the same as that;\n\t\t\t\t\tand as a matter of fact, while it is not the same as the acquisition spoken of,\n\t\t\t\t\tit is not far removed from it. One of them is natural, the other is not natural,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut carried on rather by means of a certain acquired skill or art. We may take\n\t\t\t\t\tour starting-point for its study from the following consideration: with every article of property there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdouble way of using it; both uses are related to the article itself, but not\n\t\t\t\t\trelated to it in the same mannerone is peculiar to the thing and the\n\t\t\t\t\tother is not peculiar to it. Take for example a shoethere is its wear\n\t\t\t\t\tas a shoe and there is its use as an article of exchange; for both are ways of\n\t\t\t\t\tusing a shoe, inasmuch as even he that barters a shoe for money or food with the\n\t\t\t\t\tcustomer that wants a shoe uses it as a shoe, though not for the use peculiar to\n\t\t\t\t\ta shoe, since shoes have not come into existence for the purpose of barter. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same also holds good about the other articles of property; for all of them\n\t\t\t\t\thave an art of exchange related to them, which began in the first instance from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe natural order of things, because men had more than enough of some things and\n\t\t\t\t\tless than enough of others. This\n\t\t\t\t\tconsideration also shows that the art of trade is not by nature a part of the\n\t\t\t\t\tart of wealth-getting; for the practice of barter was\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary only so far as to satisfy men's own needs. In the primaryassociation therefore I mean the\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold there is no function for trade, but it only arises after the\n\t\t\t\t\tassociation has become more numerous. For the members of the primitive household\n\t\t\t\t\tused to share commodities that were all their own, whereas on the contrary a\n\t\t\t\t\tgroup divided into several households participated also in a number of\n\t\t\t\t\tcommodities belonging to their neighbors, according to their needs for which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey were forced to make their interchanges by way of barter, as also many\n\t\t\t\t\tbarbarian tribes do still; for such tribes do not go beyond exchanging actual\n\t\t\t\t\tcommodities for actual commodities, for example giving and taking wine for corn,\n\t\t\t\t\tand so with the various other things of the sort. Exchange on these lines therefore is not contrary to\n\t\t\t\t\tnature, nor is it any branch of the art of wealth-getting, for it existed for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe replenishment of natural self-sufficiency; yet out of it the art of business\n\t\t\t\t\tin due course arose. For when they had come to supply themselves more from\n\t\t\t\t\tabroad by importing things in which they were deficient and exporting those of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich they had a surplus, the employment of money necessarily came to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdevised. For the natural necessaries are not in every case readily portable;\n\t\t\t\t\t\thence for the purpose of barter\n\t\t\t\t\tmen made a mutual compact to give and accept some substance of such a sort as\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing itself a useful commodity was easy to handle in use for general life, iron\n\t\t\t\t\tfor instance, silver and other metals, at the first stage defined merely by size\n\t\t\t\t\tand weight, but finally also by impressing on it a stamp in order that this\n\t\t\t\t\tmight relieve them of having to measure it; for the stamp was put on as a token\n\t\t\t\t\tof the amount. So when currency\n\t\t\t\t\thad been now invented as an outcome of the necessary interchange of goods, there\n\t\t\t\t\tcame into existence the other form of wealth-getting, trade, which at first no\n\t\t\t\t\tdoubt went on in a simple form, but later became more highly organized as\n\t\t\t\t\texperience discovered the sources and methods of exchange that would cause most\n\t\t\t\t\tprofit. Hence arises the idea that the art of wealth-getting deals specially\n\t\t\t\t\twith money, and that its function is to be able to discern from what source a\n\t\t\t\t\tlarge supply can be procured, as this art is supposed to be creative of riches\n\t\t\t\t\tand wealth; indeed riches are often\n\t\t\t\t\tassumed to consist of a quantity of money, because money is the thing with which\n\t\t\t\t\tthe art of business and of trade deals. But at other times, on the contrary, it\n\t\t\t\t\tis thought that money is nonsense, and nothing by nature but entirely a\n\t\t\t\t\tconvention, because when those who use it have changed the currency it is worth\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing, and because it is of no use for any of the necessary needs of life and\n\t\t\t\t\ta man well supplied with money may often be destitute of the bare necessities of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubsistence, yet it is anomalous that wealth should be of such a kind that a man\n\t\t\t\t\tmay be well supplied with it and yet die of hunger, like the famous Midas in the\n\t\t\t\t\tlegend, when owing to the insatiable covetousness of his prayer all the viands\n\t\t\t\t\tserved up to him turned into gold. Hence people seek for a different definition of riches and the art of getting\n\t\t\t\t\twealth, and rightly; for natural wealth-getting and natural riches are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent:natural wealth-getting\n\t\t\t\t\tbelongs to household management, whereas the other kind belongs to trade,\n\t\t\t\t\tproducing goods not in every way but only by the method of exchanging goods. It\n\t\t\t\t\tis this art of wealth-getting that is thought to be concerned with money, for\n\t\t\t\t\tmoney is the first principle and limit of commerce. And these riches, that are\n\t\t\t\t\tderived from this art of wealth-getting, are truly unlimited; for just as the art of\n\t\t\t\t\tmedicine is without limit in respect of health, and each of the arts is without\n\t\t\t\t\tlimit in respect of its end for they desire to produce that in the\n\t\t\t\t\thighest degree possible, whereas they are not without limit as regards\n\t\t\t\t\tthe means to their end for with all of them the end is a limit to the\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans, so also this wealth-getting has no limit in respect of its end,\n\t\t\t\t\tand its end is riches and the acquisition of goods in the commercial sense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the household branch of\n\t\t\t\t\twealth-getting has a limit, since the acquisition of commercial riches is not\n\t\t\t\t\tthe function of household management. Hence from this point of view it appears\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary that there should be a limit to all riches, yet in actual fact we\n\t\t\t\t\tobserve that the opposite takes place; for all men engaged in wealth-getting try\n\t\t\t\t\tto increase their money to an unlimited amount. The reason of this is the close\n\t\t\t\t\taffinity of the two branches of the art of business. Their common ground is that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe thing that each makes use of is the same; they use the same property,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough not in the same waythe one has another end in view, the aim\n\t\t\t\t\tof the other is the increase of the property. Consequently some people suppose\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is the function of household management to increase property, and they\n\t\t\t\t\tare continually under the idea that it is their duty to be either safeguarding\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir substance in money or increasing it to an unlimited amount. The cause of this state of mind is that\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir interests are set upon life but not upon the good life; as\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore the desire for life is unlimited, they also desire without limit the\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans productive of life. And even those who fix their aim on the good life seek\n\t\t\t\t\tthe good life as measured by bodily enjoyments, so that inasmuch as this also\n\t\t\t\t\tseems to be found in the possession of property, all their energies are occupied\n\t\t\t\t\tin the business of getting wealth; and owing to this the second kind of the art\n\t\t\t\t\tof wealth-getting has arisen. For as their enjoyment is in excess, they try to\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscover the art that is productive of enjoyable excess; and if they cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tprocure it by the art of wealth-getting, they try to do so by some other means,\n\t\t\t\t\temploying each of the faculties in an unnatural way. For it is not the function of courage to produce wealth,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut to inspire daring; nor is it the function of the military art nor of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmedical art, but it belongs to the former to bring victory and to the latter to\n\t\t\t\t\tcause health. Yet these people make all these faculties means for the business\n\t\t\t\t\tof providing wealth, in the belief that wealth is the end and that everything\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be directed to the end.We have therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed both the unnecessary branch of wealth-getting, defining it and also\n\t\t\t\t\texplaining the cause why we require it, and the necessary branch, showing that\n\t\t\t\t\tthis branch which has to do with food is different from the unnecessary branch\n\t\t\t\t\tand is by nature a part of household management, not being like that branch\n\t\t\t\t\tunlimited but having a limit. And\n\t\t\t\t\twe can also see the answer to the question raised at the beginning, whetherthe art of wealth-getting belongs to the\n\t\t\t\t\thouseholder and the statesman, or whether on the contrary supplies ought to be\n\t\t\t\t\tprovided already for just as statesmanship does not create human\n\t\t\t\t\tbeings but having received them from nature makes use of them, so also it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary for nature to bestow food by bestowing land or sea or something\n\t\t\t\t\telse, and the task of the householder is, starting with these supplies\n\t\t\t\t\tgiven, to dispose of them in the proper way. For it does not belong to the art\n\t\t\t\t\tof weaving to make fleeces, but to use them, and also to know what sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tfleece is good and suitable or bad and unsuitable. In fact the question might be raised, why the getting of\n\t\t\t\t\twealth is a part of the household art whereas the art of medicine is not a part\n\t\t\t\t\tof it, although the members of the household ought to be healthy, just as they\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be alive or fulfil any of the other essential conditions. But inasmuch as\n\t\t\t\t\talthough in a way it does belong to the householder and the ruler to see even to\n\t\t\t\t\thealth, yet in a way it does not belong to them but to the physician, so also\n\t\t\t\t\twith regard to wealth, although in a way it is the affair of the house-holder,\n\t\t\t\t\tin a way it is not, but is a matter for the subsidiary art. But best of all, as\n\t\t\t\t\thas been said before, this provision ought to be made in advance by nature. For\n\t\t\t\t\tit is the work of nature to supply nourishment for her offspring, since every\n\t\t\t\t\tcreature has for nourishment the residue of the substance from which it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsprings. Hence the\n\t\t\t\t\tbusiness of drawing provision from the fruits of the soil and from animals is\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural to all. But, as we said,\n\t\t\t\t\tthis art is twofold, one branch being of the nature of trade while the other\n\t\t\t\t\tbelongs to the household art; and the latter branch is necessary and in good\n\t\t\t\t\testeem, but the branch connected with exchange is justly discredited for it is not in accordance with nature, but involves men's taking\n\t\t\t\t\tthings from one another. As this is so, usury is most reasonably\n\t\t\t\t\thated, because its gain comes from money itself and not from that for the sake\n\t\t\t\t\tof which money was invented. For money was brought into existence for the\n\t\t\t\t\tpurpose of exchange, but interest increases the amount of the money itself\n\t\t\t\t\tand this is the actual origin of the Greek word: offspring resembles\n\t\t\t\t\tparent, and interest is money born of money; consequently this form of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe business of getting wealth is of all forms the most contrary to nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd since we have adequately\n\t\t\t\t\tdefined the scientific side of the subject, we ought to discuss it from the\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint of view of practice; although, whereas the theory of such matters is a\n\t\t\t\t\tliberal study, the practical pursuit of them is narrowing. The practically\n\t\t\t\t\tuseful branches of the art of wealth-getting are first, an expert knowledge of\n\t\t\t\t\tstock, what breeds are most profitable and in what localities and under what\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions, for instance what particular stock in horses or cattle or sheep, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly of the other animals also for the farmer must be an expert\n\t\t\t\t\tas to which of these animals are most profitable compared with one another, and\n\t\t\t\t\talso as to what breeds are most profitable on what sorts of land, since\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent breeds flourish in different places; secondly, the subject\n\t\t\t\t\tof agriculture, and this again is divided into corn-growing and fruit-farming;\n\t\t\t\t\talso bee-keeping, and the breeding of the other creatures finned and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeatheredwhich can be used to\n\t\t\t\t\tfurnish supplies. These then are the\n\t\t\t\t\tbranches and primary parts of wealth-getting in the most proper sense. Of the\n\t\t\t\t\tkind that deals with exchange, the largest branch is commerce which\n\t\t\t\t\thas three departments, ship-owning, transport and marketing: these departments\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffer from each other in the fact that some are safer and others carry larger\n\t\t\t\t\tprofits; the second branch is money-lending, and the third labor for\n\t\t\t\t\thire, one department of which is that of the mechanic arts and the other that of unskilled\n\t\t\t\t\tlaborers who are useful only for bodily service. And there is a third form of\n\t\t\t\t\twealth-getting that lies between the latter and the one placed first, since it\n\t\t\t\t\tpossesses mediate an element both of natural wealth-getting and of the sort that\n\t\t\t\t\temploys exchange; it deals with all the commodities that are obtained from the\n\t\t\t\t\tearth and from those fruitless but useful things that come from the\n\t\t\t\t\tearthexamples are the felling of timber and all sorts of mining; and of mining itself there\n\t\t\t\t\tare many classes, since there are many sorts of metals obtained out of the\n\t\t\t\t\tearth. The most\n\t\t\t\t\tscientific of these industries are those which involve the smallest element of\n\t\t\t\t\tchance, the most mechanic those in which the operatives undergo the greatest\n\t\t\t\t\tamount of bodily degradation, the most servile those in which the most uses are\n\t\t\t\t\tmade of the body, and the most ignoble those in which there is the least\n\t\t\t\t\trequirement of virtue as an accessory. But while we have even now given a\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral description of these various branches, yet a detailed and particular\n\t\t\t\t\taccount of them, though useful for the practice of the industries, would be\n\t\t\t\t\tilliberal as a subject of prolonged study. There are books on these subjects by certain authors, for\n\t\t\t\t\texample Charetides\n\t\t\t\t\tof \n\t\t\t\t\tand Apollodorus of  have\n\t\t\t\t\twritten about both agriculture and fruit-farming, and similarly others also on\n\t\t\t\t\tother topics, so these subjects may be studied from these authors by anybody\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned to do so; but in addition a collection ought also to be made of the scattered accounts of methods that have brought success\n\t\t\t\t\tin business to certain individuals. All these methods are serviceable for those\n\t\t\t\t\twho value wealth-getting, for\n\t\t\t\t\texample the plan of Thales of , which is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdevice for the business of getting wealth, but which, though it is attributed to\n\t\t\t\t\thim because of his wisdom, is really of universal application. Thales, so the\n\t\t\t\t\tstory goes, because of his poverty was taunted with the uselessness of\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy; but from his knowledge of astronomy he had observed while it was\n\t\t\t\t\tstill winter that there was going to be a large crop of olives, so he raised a\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall sum of money and paid round deposits for the whole of the olive-presses in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t and , which he hired at a low rent as nobody\n\t\t\t\t\twas running him up; and when the season arrived, there was a sudden demand for a\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of presses at the same time, and by letting them out on what terms he\n\t\t\t\t\tliked he realized a large sum of money, so proving that it is easy for\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophers to be rich if they choose, but this is not what they care about.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThales then is reported to have\n\t\t\t\t\tthus displayed his wisdom, but asa\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter of fact this device of taking an opportunity to secure a monopoly is a\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal principle of business; hence even some states have recourse to this\n\t\t\t\t\tplan as a method of raising revenue when short of funds: they introduce a\n\t\t\t\t\tmonopoly of marketable goods. There\n\t\t\t\t\twas a man in  who used a sum of\n\t\t\t\t\tmoney deposited with him to buy up all the iron from the iron mines, and\n\t\t\t\t\tafterwards when the dealers came from the trading-centers he was the only\n\t\t\t\t\tseller, though he did not greatly raise the price, but all the same he made a\n\t\t\t\t\tprofit of a hundred talents on his capital of fifty. When Dionysius came to\n\t\t\t\t\tknow of it he ordered the man to take his money with him but clear out of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t on the spot, since he was inventing\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans of profit detrimental to the tyrant's own affairs. Yet really this device\n\t\t\t\t\tis the same as the discovery of Thales, for both men alike contrived to secure\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves a monopoly. An acquaintance with these devices is also serviceable\n\t\t\t\t\tfor statesmen, for many states need financial aid and modes of revenue like\n\t\t\t\t\tthose described, just as a household may, but in greater degree; hence some\n\t\t\t\t\tstatesmen even devote their political activity exclusively to finance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd since, as we saw, the science of household\n\t\t\t\t\tmanagement has three divisions, one the relation of master to slave, of which we\n\t\t\t\t\thave spoken before, one the\n\t\t\t\t\tpaternal relation, and the third the conjugalfor it is a part of the household science to\n\t\t\t\t\trule over wife and children over both as over freemen, yet not with the same mode of government,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut over the wife to exercise republican government and over the children\n\t\t\t\t\tmonarchical; for the male is by nature better fitted to command\n\t\t\t\t\tthan the female except in some cases where their union has been formed\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to nature and the older and fully developed person than the\n\t\t\t\t\tyounger and immature. It is true that in most cases of republican government the\n\t\t\t\t\truler and the ruled interchange in turn for they tend to be on in\n\t\t\t\t\tequal level in their nature and to have no difference at all, although\n\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless during the period when one is ruler and the other ruled they seek\n\t\t\t\t\tto have a distinction by means of insignia and titles and honors, just as Amasis\n\t\t\t\t\tmade his speech about the foot-bath; but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe male stands in this relationship to the female continuously. The rule of the\n\t\t\t\t\tfather over the children on the other hand is that of a king; for the male\n\t\t\t\t\tparent is the ruler in virtue both of affection and of seniority, which is\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristic of royal government and therefore Homer finely designated Zeus by the words  as the king of them all. For though in nature the king must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe superior, in race he should be the same as his subjects, and this is the\n\t\t\t\t\tposition of the elder in relation to the younger and of the father in relation\n\t\t\t\t\tto the child. It is clear then that\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold management takes more interest in the human members of the household\n\t\t\t\t\tthan in its inanimate property, andin\n\t\t\t\t\tthe excellence of these than in that of its property, which we style riches, and\n\t\t\t\t\tmore in that of its free members than in that of slaves.First of all then as to slaves the difficulty might be raised,\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes a slave possess any other excellence, besides his merits as a tool and a\n\t\t\t\t\tservant, more valuable than these, for instance temperance, have the courage,\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice and any of the other moral virtues, or has he no excellence beside his\n\t\t\t\t\tbodily service? For either way there is difficulty; if slaves do possess moral\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue, wherein will they differ from freemen? or if they do not, this is\n\t\t\t\t\tstrange, as they are human beings and participate in reason. And nearly the same is the question also raised\n\t\t\t\t\tabout the woman and the child: have they too virtues, and ought a woman to be\n\t\t\t\t\ttemperate, brave and just, and can a child be intemperate or temperate, or not?\n\t\t\t\t\tThis point therefore requires general consideration in relation to natural ruler\n\t\t\t\t\tand subject: is virtue the same for ruler and ruled, or different? If it is\n\t\t\t\t\tproper for both to partake in nobility of character, how could it be proper for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe one to rule and the other to be ruled unconditionally? we cannot say that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe difference is to be one of degree, for ruling and being ruled differ in\n\t\t\t\t\tkind, and difference of degree is not a difference in kind at all. Whereas if on the contrary it is proper for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe one to have moral nobility but not for the other, this is surprising. For if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ruler is not temperate and just, how will he rule well? And if the ruled,\n\t\t\t\t\thow will he obey well? If intemperate and cowardly he will not perform any\n\t\t\t\t\tof the duties of his position. It is evident therefore that both must possess\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue, but that there are differences in their virtue as also there\n\t\t\t\t\tare differences between those who are by nature ruled. And of this we straightway find an indication in\n\t\t\t\t\tconnection with the soul; for the soul by nature contains a part that rules and\n\t\t\t\t\ta part that is ruled, to which we assign different virtues, that is, the virtue\n\t\t\t\t\tof the rational and that of the irrational. It is clear then that the case is the same also with the\n\t\t\t\t\tother instances of ruler and ruled. Hence there are by nature various classes of\n\t\t\t\t\trulers and ruled. For the free rules the slave, the male the female, and the man\n\t\t\t\t\tthe child in a different way. And all possess the various parts of the soul, but\n\t\t\t\t\tpossess them in different ways; for the slave has not got the deliberative part\n\t\t\t\t\tat all, and the female has it, but without full authority, while the child has\n\t\t\t\t\tit, but in an undeveloped form. Hence the ruler must possess intellectual virtue in\n\t\t\t\t\tcompleteness for any work, taken absolutely, belongs to the\n\t\t\t\t\tmaster-craftsman, and rational principle is a master-craftsman; while\n\t\t\t\t\teach of the other parties must have that share of this virtue which is\n\t\t\t\t\tappropriate to them. We must suppose therefore that the same necessarily holds\n\t\t\t\t\tgood of the moral virtues: all must partake of them, but not in the same way,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut in such measure as is proper to each in relation to his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunction.Hence it is manifest that all the persons mentioned\n\t\t\t\t\thave a moral virtue of their own, and that the temperance of a woman and that of\n\t\t\t\t\ta man are not the same, nor their courage and justice, as Socrates thought, but the one is the courage of command, and the other that of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubordination, and the case is similar with the other virtues. And this is also\n\t\t\t\t\tclear when we examine the matter more in detail, for it is misleading to give a\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral definition of virtue, as some do, who say that virtue is being in good\n\t\t\t\t\tcondition as regards the soul or acting uprightly or the like; those who\n\t\t\t\t\tenumerate the virtues of different persons separately, as Gorgias does, are much more correct than those who define virtue in that way.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence we must hold that all of these persons have their appropriate virtues, as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe poet said of woman:  though that is not the case likewise with a man. Also the child is not completely developed, so that\n\t\t\t\t\tmanifestly his virtue also is not personal to himself, but relative to the fully\n\t\t\t\t\tdeveloped being, that is, the person in authority over him. And similarly the\n\t\t\t\t\tslave's virtue also is in relation to the master.And we laid it down that the slave is serviceable for the mere necessaries of\n\t\t\t\t\tlife, so that clearly he needs only a small amount of virtue, in fact just\n\t\t\t\t\tenough to prevent him from failing in his tasks owing to intemperance and\n\t\t\t\t\tcowardice. But the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion might be raised, supposing that what has just been said is true, will\n\t\t\t\t\tartisans also need to have virtue? for they frequently fall short in their tasks\n\t\t\t\t\towing to intemperance. Or is their case entirely different? For the slave is a\n\t\t\t\t\tpartner in his master's life, but the artisan is more remote, and only so much\n\t\t\t\t\tof virtue falls to his share as of slavery for the mechanic artisan is\n\t\t\t\t\tunder a sort of limited slavery, and whereas the slave is one of the natural\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses, no shoemaker or other craftsman belongs to his trade by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature. It is manifest\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore that the master ought to be the cause to the slave of the virtue\n\t\t\t\t\tproper to a slave, but not as possessing that art of mastership which teaches a\n\t\t\t\t\tslave his tasks. Hence those persons are mistaken who deprive the slave of\n\t\t\t\t\treasoning and tell us to use command only; for admonition is more properly\n\t\t\t\t\temployed with slaves than with children.But on\n\t\t\t\t\tthese subjects let us conclude our decisions in this manner; while the question\n\t\t\t\t\tof the virtue severally belonging to man and woman and children and father, and\n\t\t\t\t\tof the right and wrong mode of conducting their mutual intercourse and the\n\t\t\t\t\tproper way of pursuing the good mode and avoiding the bad one, are matters that\n\t\t\t\t\tit will be necessary to follow up in the part of our treatise dealing with the\n\t\t\t\t\tvarious forms of constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor since every household is part\n\t\t\t\t\tof a state, and these relationships are part of the household, and the\n\t\t\t\t\texcellence of the part must have regard to that of the whole, it is necessary\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the education both of the children and of the women should be carried on\n\t\t\t\t\twith a regard to the form of the constitution, if it makes any difference as\n\t\t\t\t\tregards the goodness of the state for the children and the women to be good. And\n\t\t\t\t\tit must necessarily make a difference; for the women are a half of the free\n\t\t\t\t\tpopulation, and the childrengrow up\n\t\t\t\t\tto be the partners in the government of the state. So that as these questions\n\t\t\t\t\thave been decided, and those that remain must be discussed elsewhere, let us\n\t\t\t\t\trelinquish the present subjects as completed, and make a fresh start in our\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscourse, and first let us consider those thinkers who have advanced views\n\t\t\t\t\tabout the Ideal State."}}, {"@n": "2", "@type": "Book", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1260b",

We must first adopt as a starting-point\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is the natural point of departure for this inquiry. There are three\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible systems of property: either all the citizens must own everything in\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon, or they must own nothing in common, or some things must be common\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty and others not. To have nothing in common is clearly impossible for the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate is essentially a form of community, and to begin with there is bound to be\n\t\t\t\t\ta common locality: a single city occupies a single site, and the single city\n\t\t\t\t\tbelongs to its citizens in common. But is it better for a city that\n\t\t\t\t\tis to be well ordered to have community in everything which can possibly be made\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon property, or is it better to have some things in common and others not?\n\t\t\t\t\tFor example, it is possible for the citizens to have children, wives and\n\t\t\t\t\tpossessions in common with each other, as in Plato's , in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich Socrates says that there must be\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunity of children, women and possessions. Well then, which is preferable,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe system that now obtains, or one conforming with the regulation described in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow for all the citizens to have their wives in common involves a variety of\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties; in particular, 1 the object which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSocrates advances as the reason why this\n\t\t\t\t\tenactment should be made clearly does not follow from his arguments; also\n\t\t\t\t\t2 as a means to the end which he asserts should be the\n\t\t\t\t\tfundamental object of the city, the scheme as actually set forth in the dialogue\n\t\t\t\t\tis not practicable; yet 3 how it is to be further worked out\n\t\t\t\t\thas been nowhere definitely stated. I refer to the ideal of the fullest possible\n\t\t\t\t\tunity of the entire state, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSocrates takes as his fundamental principle. Yet it is clear that\n\t\t\t\t\tif the process of unification advances beyond a certain point, the city will not\n\t\t\t\t\tbe a city at all for a state essentially consists of a multitude of persons, and\n\t\t\t\t\tif its unification is carried beyond a certain point, city will be reduced to\n\t\t\t\t\tfamily and family to individual,for\n\t\t\t\t\twe should pronounce the family to be a more complete unity than the city, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe single person than the family; so that even if any lawgiver were able to\n\t\t\t\t\tunify the state, he must not do so, for he will destroy it in the process. And\n\t\t\t\t\tnot only does a city consist of a multitude of human beings, it consists of\n\t\t\t\t\thuman beings differing in kind. A collection of persons all alike does not\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitute a state. For a city is not the same thing as a league; a league is of\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue by its quantity, even though it is art the same in kind since\n\t\t\t\t\tthe essential object of the league is military strength, just as a\n\t\t\t\t\tweight would be worth more if it weighed more, whereas components which are to make up a\n\t\t\t\t\tunity must differ in kind and it is by this characteristic that a city will also surpass a\n\t\t\t\t\ttribe of which the population is not scattered among villages but organized like\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Arcadians. Hence reciprocal equality is the preservative of states, as has been said\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore in the . For even among the free and equal this\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple must necessarily obtain, since all cannot govern at once: they must\n\t\t\t\t\thold office for a year at a time or by some other arrangement or period; and in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis manner it does actually come about that all govern, just as all shoemakers\n\t\t\t\t\twould be also carpenters if the shoemakers and the carpenters kept on changing\n\t\t\t\t\ttrades instead of the same persons being shoemakers and carpenters always.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut since such permanence of\n\t\t\t\t\tfunction is better for the political community also, it is clear that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tbetter for the same persons to govern always, if possible; and among peoples\n\t\t\t\t\twhere it is impossible because all the citizens are equal in their nature,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyet at the same time it is only just, whether governing is a\n\t\t\t\t\tgood thing or a bad, that all should partake in it, and for equals thus to\n\t\t\t\t\tsubmit to authority in turn imitates their being originally dissimilar; for some govern and others are\n\t\t\t\t\tgoverned by turn, as though becoming other persons; and also similarly when they\n\t\t\t\t\thold office the holders of different offices are different persons. It is clear then from these considerations\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is not an outcome of nature for the state to be a unity in the manner in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich certain persons say that it is, and that what has been said to be the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatest good in states really destroys states; yet surely a thing's particular\n\t\t\t\t\tgood acts as its preservative.Another line of consideration also\n\t\t\t\t\tshows that to seek to unify the state excessively is not beneficial. In point of\n\t\t\t\t\tself-sufficiency the individual is surpassed by the family and the family by the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate, and in principle a state is fully realized only when it comes to pass\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the community of numbers is self-sufficing; if therefore the more\n\t\t\t\t\tself-sufficing a community is, the more desirable is its condition, then a less\n\t\t\t\t\tdegree of unity is more desirable than a greater. Again, even granting that\n\t\t\t\t\tit is best for the community to be as complete a unity as possible, complete\n\t\t\t\t\tunity does not seem to be proved by the formula if all the citizens\n\t\t\t\t\tsay Mine and Not mine at the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime, which Socrates thinks to be a sign of thecity's being completely one.\n\t\t\t\t\tAll is an ambiguous term. If it means each\n\t\t\t\t\tseverally, very likely this would more fully realize the state of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which Socrates wishes to produce\n\t\t\t\t\tfor in that case every citizen will call the same boy his son and also\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same woman his wife, and will speak in the same way of property and indeed\n\t\t\t\t\tof each of the accessories of life but  the citizens, having\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunity of women and children, will not call them theirs\n\t\t\t\t\tin this sense, but will mean theirs collectively and not severally, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly they will call property theirs meaning the\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty of them all, not of each of them severally. We see then that the phrase\n\t\t\t\t\tall say is equivocal in fact the words\n\t\t\t\t\tall, both,\n\t\t\t\t\todd, even, owing to their ambiguity,\n\t\t\t\t\toccasion argumentative quibbling even in philosophical discussions;\n\t\t\t\t\thence really for all to say the same thing is in one sense admirable, although\n\t\t\t\t\timpracticable, but in another sense is not at all a sign of concord. And furthermore, the proposal has another\n\t\t\t\t\tdisadvantage. Property that is common to the greatest number of owners receives\n\t\t\t\t\tthe least attention; men care most for their private possessions, and for what\n\t\t\t\t\tthey own in common less, or only so far as it falls to their own individual\n\t\t\t\t\tshare for in addition to the other reasons, they think less of it on the ground\n\t\t\t\t\tthat someone else is thinking about it, just as in household service a large\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of domestics sometimes give worse attendance than a smaller number.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd it results in each\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen's having a thousand sons, and these do not belong to them as individuals\n\t\t\t\t\tbut any child is equally the son of anyone, so that all alike will regard them\n\t\t\t\t\twith indifference. Again, each speaks\n\t\t\t\t\tof one of his fellow-citizens who is prospering or getting on badly as\n\t\t\t\t\tmy son only in the sense of the fractional part which he\n\t\t\t\t\tforms of the whole numberthat is, he says my\n\t\t\t\t\tson or so-and-so's son, specifying as the\n\t\t\t\t\tfather any individual of the thousand citizens or whatever the number be of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the state consists, and even this dubiously, for it is uncertain who has\n\t\t\t\t\tchanced to have had a son born to him and when born safely reared. Yet which is the better way to use the\n\t\t\t\t\tword minethis way, each of two thousand or ten\n\t\t\t\t\tthousand people applying it to the same thing, or rather the way in which they\n\t\t\t\t\tsay mine in the actual states now? for the same person is\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled my son by one man and my\n\t\t\t\t\tbrother by another, and another calls him\n\t\t\t\t\tnephew, or by some other relationship, whether of blood or\n\t\t\t\t\tby affinity and marriage, the speaker's own in the first place, or that of his\n\t\t\t\t\trelations; and in addition someone else calls him\n\t\t\t\t\tfellow-clansman or fellow-tribesman.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor it is better for a boy to be one's own private nephew than one's son in the\n\t\t\t\t\tway described. Moreover it would\n\t\t\t\t\talso be impossible to avoid men's supposing certain persons to be their real\n\t\t\t\t\tbrothers and sons and fathers and mothers; for they would be bound to form their\n\t\t\t\t\tbelief about each other by the resemblances which occur between children and\n\t\t\t\t\tparents. This indeed is said by some of those who write of travels round the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworld actually to occur;they say that some of the people of Upper\n\t\t\t\t\tLibya have their wives in common, yet the children born are divided among them\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to their personal resemblances. And there are some females both of the\n\t\t\t\t\thuman race and of the other animals, for instance horses and cattle, who have a\n\t\t\t\t\tstrong natural tendency to produce off-spring resembling the male parents, as\n\t\t\t\t\twas the case with the mare at \n\t\t\t\t\tnamed Honest Lady.\n\t\t\t\t\tMoreover it is not easy for those who institute this communism to guard\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst such objectionable occurrences as outrage, involuntary and in some cases\n\t\t\t\t\tvoluntary homicide, fights, abusive language; all of which are violations of\n\t\t\t\t\tpiety when committed against fathers, mothers and near relatives as if they were\n\t\t\t\t\tnot relatives; but these are bound to occur more frequently when people do not\n\t\t\t\t\tknow their relations than when they do, and also, when they do occur, if the\n\t\t\t\t\toffenders know their relationship it is possible for them to have the customary\n\t\t\t\t\texpiations performed, but for those who do not no expiation is possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlso it is curious that a\n\t\t\t\t\ttheorist who makes the sons common property only debars lovers from intercourse\n\t\t\t\t\tand does not prohibit love, nor the other familiarities, which between father\n\t\t\t\t\tand son or brother and brother are most unseemly, since even the fact of love\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween them is unseemly. And it is also strange that he deprives them of\n\t\t\t\t\tintercourse for no other reason except because the pleasure is too violent; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he thinks it makes no difference that the parties are in the one case\n\t\t\t\t\tfather or son and in the other case brothers of one another. And it seems that\n\t\t\t\t\tthis community of wives and sons is more serviceable for the Farmer class than\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the Guardians; for there will be less friendship among them if\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir children and women are in common, and unfriendliness in the subject\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses is a good thing with a view to their being submissive to authority and\n\t\t\t\t\tnot making revolution. But speaking\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally such a law is bound to bring about the opposite state of things to\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which rightly enacted laws ought properly to cause, and because of which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSocrates thinks it necessary to\n\t\t\t\t\tmake these regulations about the children and women. For we think that\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship is the greatest of blessings for the state, since it is the best\n\t\t\t\t\tsafeguard against revolution, and the unity of the state, which\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates praises most highly, both appears to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe and is said by him to be the effect of friendship, just as we know that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAristophanes in the discourses on love describes how the\n\t\t\t\t\tlovers owing to their extreme affection desire to grow together and both become\n\t\t\t\t\tone instead of being two. In such a\n\t\t\t\t\tunion it would be inevitable that both would be spoiled, or at least one, and in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe state friendship would inevitably become watery in consequence of such\n\t\t\t\t\tassociation, and the expressions my father and\n\t\t\t\t\tmy son would quite go out. For just as putting a little\n\t\t\t\t\tsugar into a quantity of water makes the mixture imperceptible, so it also must\n\t\t\t\t\tcome about that the mutual relationship based on these names must become\n\t\t\t\t\t\timperceptible,since in the\n\t\t\t\t\trepublic described by Plato there will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe the least possible necessity for people to care for one another as father for\n\t\t\t\t\tsons or as son for father or as brother for brother. For there are two things\n\t\t\t\t\tthat most cause men to care for and to love each other, the sense of ownership\n\t\t\t\t\tand the sense of preciousness; and neither motive can be present with the\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens of a state so constituted. Again, as to the transference of some of the children at birth from the\n\t\t\t\t\tFarmers and Artisans to the Guardians and of others from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Guardians to the Farmers and Artisans, there is much confusion as to how it\n\t\t\t\t\tis to be done; and the parents who give the children and the officials who\n\t\t\t\t\ttransfer them are bound to know which they give to whom. And again, the things\n\t\t\t\t\tspoken of above are bound to occur even more with these transferred children,\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch as outrage, love-making and murder; for the children of the Guardians\n\t\t\t\t\ttransferred to the other citizens will no longer speak of the Guardians as\n\t\t\t\t\tbrothers and children and fathers and mothers, nor yet will those living among\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Guardians so speak of the other classes, so as to be careful not to commit\n\t\t\t\t\tany such offence because of their relationship.Such therefore may be our decision as to community of children and women.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn connection with this we have to consider the due regulation of property in\n\t\t\t\t\ta community that is to have the best political institutions: should property be\n\t\t\t\t\towned in common or privately? This question might indeed be considered\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately from the system laid down by law with regard to the children and the\n\t\t\t\t\twomen: I mean, even if there be separate families as is now the case\n\t\t\t\t\twith all nations, is it better for both the ownership and the employment of\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty to be in common. . . , for example, should the farms\n\t\t\t\t\tbe separate property but the farm-produce be brought into the common stock for\n\t\t\t\t\tconsumption as is the practice with some non-Greek races; or\n\t\t\t\t\ton the contrary should the land be common and farmed in common, but the produce\n\t\t\t\t\tbe divided for private use and this form of communism also is said to\n\t\t\t\t\tprevail among some of the barbarians; or should both farms and produce\n\t\t\t\t\tbe common property? Now if the\n\t\t\t\t\ttillers of the soil be of a different class there might be another and easier system,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut if the citizens do the work for themselves, the regulations for the common\n\t\t\t\t\townership of property would give more causes for discontent; for if both in the\n\t\t\t\t\tenjoyment of the produce and in the work of production they prove not equal but\n\t\t\t\t\tunequal, complaints are bound to arise between those who enjoy or take much but\n\t\t\t\t\twork little and those who take less but work more. And in general to live together and share all our human\n\t\t\t\t\taffairs is difficult, and especially to share such things as these. And this is\n\t\t\t\t\tshown in the partnerships of fellow-travellers, for almost the greatest number\n\t\t\t\t\tof them quarrel because they come into collision with one another as a result of\n\t\t\t\t\tordinary matters and trifles; and also we come into collision most with those of\n\t\t\t\t\tour servantswhom we employ most often\n\t\t\t\t\tfor ordinary attendance. Community\n\t\t\t\t\tof property therefore involves these and other similar difficulties; and the\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent system, if further improved by good morals and by the regulation of\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrect legislation, would be greatly superior. For it will possess the merit of\n\t\t\t\t\tboth systems, by which I mean the advantage of property being common and the\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantage of its being private. For property ought to be common in a sense but\n\t\t\t\t\tprivate speaking absolutely. For the superintendence of properties being divided\n\t\t\t\t\tamong the owners will not cause these mutual complaints, and will improve the\n\t\t\t\t\tmore because each will apply himself to it as to private business of his own;\n\t\t\t\t\twhile on the other hand virtue will be exercised to make friends'\n\t\t\t\t\tgoods common goods, as the proverb goes, for the purpose of\n\t\t\t\t\tuse. Such a system exists even now\n\t\t\t\t\tin outline in some states, showing that it is not impracticable, and especially\n\t\t\t\t\tin the ones that are well-administered parts of it are realized already and\n\t\t\t\t\tparts might be realized; for individuals while owning their property privately\n\t\t\t\t\tput their own possessions at the service of their friends and make use of their\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends' possessions as common property; for instance in  people use one another's slaves as\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtually their own, as well as horses and hounds, and also use the produce in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe fields throughout the country if they need provisions on a journey. It is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear therefore that it is better for possessions to be privately owned, but to\n\t\t\t\t\tmake them common property in use; and to train the citizens to this is the\n\t\t\t\t\tspecial task of the legislator. And\n\t\t\t\t\tmoreover to feel that a thing is one's private property makes an inexpressibly\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat difference for pleasure; for the universal feeling of love for oneself is\n\t\t\t\t\tsurely not purposeless, but a natural instinct. Selfishness on the\n\t\t\t\t\tother hand is justly blamed; but this is not to love oneself but to love oneself\n\t\t\t\t\tmore than one ought, just as covetousness means loving money to\n\t\t\t\t\texcesssince some love of self, money and so on is practically\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal. Moreover, to bestow favors and assistance on friends or visitors or\n\t\t\t\t\tcomrades is a great pleasure, and a condition of this is the private ownership\n\t\t\t\t\tof property. These advantages\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore do not come to those who carry the unification of the state too far;\n\t\t\t\t\tand in addition to this they manifestly do away with the practice of two\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtues, temperance in relation to women for it is a noble deed to\n\t\t\t\t\trefrain from one through temperance when she belongs to another and\n\t\t\t\t\tliberality in relation to possessions for one will not be able to\n\t\t\t\t\tdisplay liberality nor perform a single liberal action, since the active\n\t\t\t\t\texercise of liberality takes place in the use of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossessions.Such legislation therefore has an attractive appearance,\n\t\t\t\t\tand might be thought to be humane; for he who is told about it welcomes it with\n\t\t\t\t\tgladness, thinking that it will result in a marvellous friendliness of everybody\n\t\t\t\t\ttowards everybody, especially when somebody denounces the evils at present\n\t\t\t\t\texisting in states as due to the fact thatwealth is not owned in common I mean lawsuits\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween citizens about breach of contract, and trials for perjury, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tflattery of the rich. But the real\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of all these evils is not the absence of communism, but wickedness, since\n\t\t\t\t\twe see far more quarrels occurring among those who own or use property in common\n\t\t\t\t\tthan among those who have their estates separate; but we notice that those who\n\t\t\t\t\tquarrel as a result of their partnerships are few when compared with the total\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of private owners. And again it is just to state not only all the evils\n\t\t\t\t\tthat men will lose by adopting communism, but also all the good things; and life\n\t\t\t\t\tin such circumstances is seen to be utterly impossible. The cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates' error must be deemed to be that his\n\t\t\t\t\tfundamental assumption was incorrect. It is certain that in a way both the\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold and the state should be a unit, but they should not be so in every\n\t\t\t\t\tway. For in one way the state as its unification proceeds will cease to be a\n\t\t\t\t\tstate, and in another way, though it continues a state, yet by coming near to\n\t\t\t\t\tceasing to be one it will be a worse state, just as if one turned a harmony into\n\t\t\t\t\tunison or a rhythm into a single foot. The proper thing is for the state, while being a\n\t\t\t\t\tmultitude, to be made a partnership and a unity by means of education, as has\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen said before and it is strange that the very philosopher who intends to\n\t\t\t\t\tintroduce a system of education and thinks that this will make the city morally\n\t\t\t\t\tgood should fancy that he can regulate society by such measures as have been\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned instead of by manners and culture and laws, just as the legislator\n\t\t\t\t\tintroduced community of property in  and  by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe institution of public messes. And this very point also must\n\t\t\t\t\tnot be ignored, that attention must be paid to length of time and to the long\n\t\t\t\t\tperiod of years, in which it would not have escaped notice if these measures\n\t\t\t\t\twere good ones; for nearly all of them have been discovered already, although\n\t\t\t\t\tsome of them have not been collected together and others though brought to\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge are not put into practice. And their value would become most manifest if one could see such a\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution in actual process of formation; for one will only be able to\n\t\t\t\t\tconstruct Plato's state by introducing its partitions and dividing up the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunity into common messes and also into brotherhoods and tribes. So that in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe upshot no other regulation will have been enacted except the exemption of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Guardians from the work of agriculture, which is a measure that even now the\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartans attempt to introduce.Moreover, the\n\t\t\t\t\tworking of the constitution as a whole in regard to the members of the state has\n\t\t\t\t\talso not been described by Socrates,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor is it easy to say what it will be. Yet the general mass of the citizens of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other classes make almost the bulk of the state, and about these no definite\n\t\t\t\t\tregulations are laid down, as to whether the Farmers also are to have their\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty in common or to hold it in private ownership, and also whether\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunity of wives and children is to apply to them or not. For if the Farmers are to have the same complete\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunism, what will be the difference between them and the Guardian class? or\n\t\t\t\t\twhat advantage will they gain by submitting to their government? or what\n\t\t\t\t\tconsideration will induce them to submit tothe government, unless the Guardians adopt some clever device\n\t\t\t\t\tlike that of the Cretans? These have conceded to their slaves all the same\n\t\t\t\t\trights as they have themselves except that they are forbidden gymnastic\n\t\t\t\t\texercises and the possession of arms. But if the family life and property of the\n\t\t\t\t\tFarmers are to be such as they are in other states, what sort of communism will\n\t\t\t\t\tthere be? For there will inevitably be two states in one, and these antagonistic\n\t\t\t\t\tto one another. For Socrates makes the\n\t\t\t\t\tGuardians a sort of garrison, while the Farmers, Artisans and other classes are\n\t\t\t\t\tthe citizens.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut quarrels and lawsuits and all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other evils which according to\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates exist in actual states will all be found among his\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens too. Yet he says that owing to their education they will not need many\n\t\t\t\t\tregulations such as city and market by-laws and the other regulations of that\n\t\t\t\t\tsort, although he assigns his education only to the Guardians. Again, he makes\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Farmers the masters of the estates, for which they pay rent; but they are\n\t\t\t\t\tlikely to be far more unmanageable and rebellious than the classes of helots,\n\t\t\t\t\tserfs and slaves in certain states today. However, whether this communism is to be compulsory for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Farmers in the same way as for the Guardians or whether it is not, has as a\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter of fact not been definitely stated anywhere, nor is there any information\n\t\t\t\t\tabout the connected questions, what are to be the political functions and the\n\t\t\t\t\teducation of the lower classes, and the laws affecting them. But it is not easy\n\t\t\t\t\tto discover the answers to these questions, yet the character of the lower\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses is of no small importance for the preservation of the community of the\n\t\t\t\t\tGuardians. But again, if Socrates\n\t\t\t\t\tintends to make the Farmers have their wives in common but their property\n\t\t\t\t\tprivate, who is to manage the household in the way in which the women's husbands\n\t\t\t\t\twill carry on the work of the farms? And if the property and the wives of the\n\t\t\t\t\tFarmers are to be common . . . \n\t\t\t\t\tIt\n\t\t\t\t\tis also strange that Socrates employs\n\t\t\t\t\tthe comparison of the lower animals to show that the women are to have the same\n\t\t\t\t\toccupations as the men, considering that animals have no households to manage.\n\t\t\t\t\tAlso Socrates' method of appointing the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates is not a safe one. For he makes the same persons hold office always;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut this occasions rebellion even among people of no special distinction, much\n\t\t\t\t\tmore so then among high-spirited and warlike men. But it is clear that he is\n\t\t\t\t\tcompelled to make the same persons govern always, for the god-given admixture of\n\t\t\t\t\tgold in the soul is not bestowed on some at one time and others at another time,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut is always in the same men, and\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates says that at the moment of birth some men receive an\n\t\t\t\t\tadmixture of gold and others of silver and those who are to be the Artisans and\n\t\t\t\t\tFarmers an admixture of copper and iron. And again, although he deprives the Guardians of\n\t\t\t\t\thappiness, he says that it is the duty of the law-giver to make the whole city\n\t\t\t\t\thappy. But it is not possible for the whole to be happy unless most or all of\n\t\t\t\t\tits parts, or some of them, possess happiness. For happiness is not a thing of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same sortas being an even number:\n\t\t\t\t\tthat may belong to a whole but not to either of its parts, but happiness cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to the whole and not to its parts. But yet, if the Guardians are not\n\t\t\t\t\thappy, what other class is? For clearly the Artisans and the general mass of the\n\t\t\t\t\tvulgar classes are not.The Republic discussed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSocrates therefore possesses these\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties and also others not smaller than these.And almost the same holds\n\t\t\t\t\tgood of the  also, which was written later, so that it will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe advantageous to make some small examination of the constitution described in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat book as well. For in the \n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates has laid down details about\n\t\t\t\t\tvery few mattersregulations about community of wives and children and\n\t\t\t\t\tabout property, and the structure of the constitution for the mass of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe population is divided into two parts, one forming the Farmer class and the\n\t\t\t\t\tother the class that defends the state in war, and there is a third class drawn\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom these latter that forms the council and governs the state, but\n\t\t\t\t\tabout the Farmers and the Artisans, whether they are excluded from government or\n\t\t\t\t\thave some part in it, and whether these classes also are to possess arms and to\n\t\t\t\t\tserve in war with the others or not, on these points\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates has made no decision, but though he\n\t\t\t\t\tthinks that the women ought to serve in war with the Guardians and share the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame education, the rest of the discourse he has filled up with external topics,\n\t\t\t\t\tand about the sort of education which it is proper for the Guardians to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut though the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t consists for the most part of a treatise on law, the\n\t\t\t\t\tauthor has said a little about the form of the constitution, and in a desire to\n\t\t\t\t\tmake this more suitable for adoption by actual states he brings it round by\n\t\t\t\t\tdegrees back to the other form, that of the . For except\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunity in wives and property, he assigns all his other regulations in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame form to both states, for he prescribes for both the same scheme of\n\t\t\t\t\teducation, and a life detached from menial tasks, and similarly as regards\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon meals, except that in the state described in the  he\n\t\t\t\t\tsays there are to be common meals for women also, and he makes the Republic\n\t\t\t\t\tconsist of a class possessing arms that numbers a thousand, but the state of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t has five thousand.Now it is true that all the\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscourses of Socrates possess brilliance, cleverness, originality and keenness\n\t\t\t\t\tof inquiry, but it is no doubt difficult to be right about everything: for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance with regard to the size of population just mentioned it must not be\n\t\t\t\t\tover-looked that a territory as large as that of  will be needed for so many inhabitants, or some other\n\t\t\t\t\tcountry of unlimited extent, to support five thousand men in idleness and\n\t\t\t\t\tanother swarm of women and servants around them many times as numerous. It is\n\t\t\t\t\tproper no doubt to assume ideal conditions, but not to go beyond all bounds of\n\t\t\t\t\tpossibility. And it is said that in\n\t\t\t\t\tlaying down the laws the legislator must have his attention fixed on two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings,the territory and the\n\t\t\t\t\tpopulation. But also it would be well to add that he must take into account the\n\t\t\t\t\tneighboring regions also, if the city is to live a life of politics for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary for it to use for war not only such arms as are serviceable within its\n\t\t\t\t\town territory but also such as are serviceable against places outside\n\t\t\t\t\tit; and if one does not accept such a description whether for the life\n\t\t\t\t\tof the individual or for the common life of the state, yet it is none the less\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary for the citizens to be formidable to their enemies not only when they\n\t\t\t\t\thave entered the country but also when they have left it.\n\t\t\t\t\tAlso the amount of property requires\n\t\t\t\t\tconsideration: would it not perhaps be better to define it differently, by a\n\t\t\t\t\tclearer formula? The writer says that it ought to be sufficiently large for the\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens to live a temperate lifeas if one were\n\t\t\t\t\tto say to live a good life; but really that phrase is too\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral, since it is possible to live temperately yet miserably. But a better\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition would be to live temperately and liberally\n\t\t\t\t\tfor if the two are separated a liberal mode of life is liable to slip\n\t\t\t\t\tinto luxury and a temperate one into a life of hardship, since surely\n\t\t\t\t\tthese are the only desirable qualities relating to the use of\n\t\t\t\t\twealthfor instance you cannot use wealth gently or bravely, but you\n\t\t\t\t\tcan use it temperately and liberally, so that it follows that these are\n\t\t\t\t\tqualities that have to do with wealth. And it is also strange that although equalizing properties\n\t\t\t\t\tthe writer does not regulate the number of the citizens, but leaves the\n\t\t\t\t\tbirth-rate uncontrolled, on the assumption that it will be sufficiently levelled\n\t\t\t\t\tup to the same total owing to childless marriages, however many children are\n\t\t\t\t\tbegotten, because this seems to take place in the states at present. But\n\t\t\t\t\tthis ought to be regulated much more in the supposed case than it is now, for\n\t\t\t\t\tnow nobody is destitute, because estates are divided among any number, but then,\n\t\t\t\t\tas division of estates will not be allowed, the extra children will necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\thave nothing, whether they are fewer in number or more. And one might think that restriction ought to be\n\t\t\t\t\tput on the birth-rate rather than on property, so as not to allow more than a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain number of children to be produced, and that in fixing their number\n\t\t\t\t\tconsideration should be paid to the chances of its happening that some of the\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren born may die, and to the absence of children in the other marriages;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut for the matter to be left alone, as it is in most states, is bound to lead\n\t\t\t\t\tto poverty among the citizens, and poverty produces sedition and crime. The\n\t\t\t\t\tCorinthian Phidon\n\t\t\t\t\tin fact, one of the most ancient lawgivers, thought that the house-holds and the\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen population ought to remain at the same numbers, even though at the\n\t\t\t\t\toutset the estates of all were unequal in size; but in Plato's\n\t\t\t\t\t\t the opposite is the case. However, we must say later\n\t\t\t\t\twhat we think would be a better system in these matters; but another question omitted in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t is how the rulers will be different from the classes\n\t\t\t\t\truled; the writer prescribesthat the\n\t\t\t\t\trulers are to stand in the same relation to the ruled as the warp of cloth\n\t\t\t\t\tstands to the woof by being made of different wool. And inasmuch as he allows a man's\n\t\t\t\t\ttotal property to be increased up to five times its original value, for what\n\t\t\t\t\treason should not an increase in his landed estate be allowed up to a certain\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint? Also it must be considered whether the proposed separation of homesteads\n\t\t\t\t\tis not inexpedient for household economyfor the writer allotted two\n\t\t\t\t\thomesteads separate from one another to each citizen; but it is difficult to\n\t\t\t\t\tmanage two households.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd the whole constitution is\n\t\t\t\t\tintended, it is true, to be neither a democracy nor an oligarchy, but of the\n\t\t\t\t\tform intermediate between them which is termed a republic, for the government is\n\t\t\t\t\tconstituted from the class that bears arms. If therefore he introduces this\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution as the one most commonly existing of all forms of constitution in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe actual states, he has perhaps made a good proposal, but if he introduces it\n\t\t\t\t\tas the next best to the first form of constitution, it is not a good proposal;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor very likely one might approve the Spartan constitution more highly, or\n\t\t\t\t\tperhaps some other form nearer to an aristocracy. In fact some people assert that the best constitution must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe a combination of all the forms of constitution, and therefore praise the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution of  for\n\t\t\t\t\tsome people say that it consists of oligarchy, monarchy and democracy, meaning\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the kingship is monarchy and the rule of the ephors oligarchy, but that an\n\t\t\t\t\telement of democracy is introduced by the rule of the ephors because the ephors\n\t\t\t\t\tcome from the common people; while others pronounce the ephorate a tyranny but\n\t\t\t\t\tfind an element of democracy in the public mess-tables and in the other\n\t\t\t\t\tregulations of daily life. In Plato's  on the other hand it is\n\t\t\t\t\tstated that the best constitution must consist of a combination of democracy and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttyranny, which one might\n\t\t\t\t\trefuse to count as constitutional governments at all, or else rank as the worst\n\t\t\t\t\tof all constitutions. A better theory therefore is put forward by those who\n\t\t\t\t\tintermingle a larger number of forms, for the constitution composed of a\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination of a larger number of forms is better. In the next place, the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution in the  proves as a matter of fact not to\n\t\t\t\t\tcontain any element of monarchy at all, but its factors are taken from oligarchy\n\t\t\t\t\tand democracy, and for the most part it tends to incline towards oligarchy. This\n\t\t\t\t\tappears from the regulations for the appointment of the magistrates; for their\n\t\t\t\t\tselection by lot from a list previously elected by vote is a feature common to\n\t\t\t\t\tboth oligarchy and democracy, but the compulsion put upon the richer citizens to\n\t\t\t\t\tattend the assembly and vote for magistrates or perform any other political\n\t\t\t\t\tfunction, while the others are allowed to do as they like, is oligarchical, as\n\t\t\t\t\tis the endeavor to secure that a majority of the magistrates shall be drawn from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe wealthy and that the highest offices shall be filled from the highest of the\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses assessed by wealth. But the\n\t\t\t\t\twriter also makes the election of the council oligarchical for everybody is\n\t\t\t\t\tcompelled to elect, but from the first property-class, and then again an equal\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber from the second class, and then from the members of the third class,\n\t\t\t\t\texcept that it was not to be compulsory for all to vote for those to be elected\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the members of the third or the fourth class, and to elect from the fourth\n\t\t\t\t\tclass was only compulsory for the members of the first and second classes; and\n\t\t\t\t\tafterwards from those thus selected he says that they are to appointan equal number from each class. Thus those\n\t\t\t\t\twho elect the members from the highest property classes will be more numerous\n\t\t\t\t\tand better, because some of the lower\n\t\t\t\t\torders will abstain from voting as\n\t\t\t\t\tit is not compulsory. Accordingly\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is not proper to establish a constitution of this character from a blend\n\t\t\t\t\tof democracy and monarchy appears clearly from these considerations, and from\n\t\t\t\t\twhat will be said later when our inquiry comes to deal with this class of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution; also the provision for the election of the rulers from among\n\t\t\t\t\tcandidates chosen at a preliminary election is dangerous, for if even a moderate\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of people choose to combine into a party, the elections will always go\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to their wish.Such are the points as to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe constitution in the \n\t\t\t\t\tThere\n\t\t\t\t\tare also certain other constitutional schemes, some drawn up by amateurs and\n\t\t\t\t\tothers by philosophers and statesmen, but all of them are nearer to those which\n\t\t\t\t\thave been actually established and by which states are governed at present than\n\t\t\t\t\tare both of those which have been considered; for nobody else has introduced the\n\t\t\t\t\tinnovation of community of children and women, nor that of public meals for the\n\t\t\t\t\twomen, but they start rather with the necessary reforms. For some persons think\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the right regulation of property is the most important; for the question of\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty, they say, is universally the cause of party strife. Therefore the\n\t\t\t\t\tChalcedonian Phaleas was the first who introduced this expedient; for he says that the citizens' estates\n\t\t\t\t\tought to be equal and he thought that this would not be difficult to\n\t\t\t\t\tsecure at the outset for cities in process of foundation, while in those already\n\t\t\t\t\tsettled, although it would be a more irksome task, nevertheless a levelling\n\t\t\t\t\twould most easily be effected by the rich giving dowries but not receiving them\n\t\t\t\t\tand the poor receiving but not giving them. Plato when writing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t thought that up to a certain point inequality ought to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe allowed, but that no citizen should be permitted to acquire more land than\n\t\t\t\t\twould make his estate five times the size of the smallest, as has also been said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore.But those who bring in legislation of this sort must also not\n\t\t\t\t\toverlook this point, which is overlooked at present, that when regulating the\n\t\t\t\t\tamount of property legislators ought also to regulate the size of the family;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor if the number of children becomes too large for the property, the law is\n\t\t\t\t\tquite sure to be broken, and apart from the breach of the law it is a bad thing\n\t\t\t\t\tthat many citizens who were rich should become poor, for it is difficult for\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch men not to be advocates of a new order. That a level standard of property affects the community of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe citizens in an important manner some men even in old times clearly have\n\t\t\t\t\trecognized; for example there is the legislation of Solon, and other states have\n\t\t\t\t\ta law prohibiting the acquisition of land to any amount that the individual may\n\t\t\t\t\tdesire; and similarly there is legislation to prevent the sale of estates, as at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t there is a lawthat a man shall not sell unless he can\n\t\t\t\t\tprove that manifest misfortune has befallen him and also there is legislation to\n\t\t\t\t\tpreserve the old allotments, and the repeal of this restriction at  made the Leucadian constitution\n\t\t\t\t\texcessively democratic, for it came about that the offices were no longer filled\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the established property-qualifications. But it is possible that equality of estates may be\n\t\t\t\t\tmaintained, but their size may be either too large and promote luxury, or too\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall, causing a penurious standard of living; it is clear therefore that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot enough for the lawgiver to make the estates equal, but he must aim at\n\t\t\t\t\tsecuring a medium size. And again, even if one prescribed a moderate property\n\t\t\t\t\tfor all, it would be of no avail, since it is more needful to level men's\n\t\t\t\t\tdesires than their properties, and this can only be done by an adequate system\n\t\t\t\t\tof education enforced by law. But\n\t\t\t\t\tperhaps Phaleas would say that he himself actually prescribes this, as he\n\t\t\t\t\tconsiders it fundamentally necessary for states to have equality in these two\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, property and education. But the nature of the education needs to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdefined: it is no use merely for it to be one and the same for all, for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible for all to have one and the same education but for this to be of such a\n\t\t\t\t\tnature as to make them desirous of getting more than their share of money or\n\t\t\t\t\thonor or both; moreover civil strife is caused not only by\n\t\t\t\t\tinequality of property but also by inequality of honors, though the two motives\n\t\t\t\t\toperate in opposite waysthe masses are discontented if possessions\n\t\t\t\t\tare unequally distributed, the upper classes if honors are equally\n\t\t\t\t\tdistributed, bringing it about that  Nor do men do wrong for the sake of the bare necessities only, the sort\n\t\t\t\t\tof wrongdoing for which Phaleas thinks that equality of substance is a\n\t\t\t\t\tcurepreventing highway robbery by removing the motive of cold or\n\t\t\t\t\thunger; men also do wrong to gain pleasure and to satisfy desire. For if they\n\t\t\t\t\thave a desire above the bare necessities of existence, they will transgress to\n\t\t\t\t\tcure this desire; and moreover not because of desire only, but in order that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey may enjoy the pleasures that are not associated with pains. What remedy then is there for these three\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses of offenders? For the first class, a modest competence and work; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsecond, temperance; and as for the third sort, any people who desire pleasures\n\t\t\t\t\tthat depend on themselves would require no cure for their desires save that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is derived from philosophy, for the other pleasures require the aid of\n\t\t\t\t\tfellow-creatures. Since clearly the greatest transgressions spring from a desire\n\t\t\t\t\tfor superfluities, not for bare necessaries for example, men do not\n\t\t\t\t\tbecome tyrants in order to avoid shivering with cold, and accordingly high\n\t\t\t\t\thonors are awarded to one who kills a tyrant, but not to one who kills a\n\t\t\t\t\tthief; so that the method of the constitution of Phaleas is\n\t\t\t\t\tefficacious only against the minor social disorders. Again, Phaleas desires to frame institutions for the most\n\t\t\t\t\tpart which will lead to a right state of affairs in the internal relations of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe citizens, but the legislator should also have regard to relations with the\n\t\t\t\t\tneighboring peoples and with all foreign nations.It is essential therefore for the constitution to be framed\n\t\t\t\t\twith a view to military strength, about which Phaleas has said nothing. And the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame is true also about property; for the citizens should not only possess\n\t\t\t\t\tenough to meet their requirements in civic life, but also to encounter the\n\t\t\t\t\tperils that face them from outside; hence they should possess neither so large\n\t\t\t\t\tan amount of wealth that it will be coveted by their neighbors and by stronger\n\t\t\t\t\tstates while its possessors will be unable to repel their assailants, nor yet so\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall an amount as not to be capable of sustaining a war even against equal and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar states. Phaleas, it is\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue, has laid down no rule at all, but the question must not be overlooked,\n\t\t\t\t\twhat amount of wealth is advantageous. Perhaps therefore the best limit to\n\t\t\t\t\tprescribe is that it must not profit a stronger people to make war upon the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate because of its excessive wealth, but only just as it might do even if the\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens had not got so much property. For example, when Autophradates was about\n\t\t\t\t\tto lay siege to , Eubulus bade him\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider how long it would take him to capture the place, and then calculate\n\t\t\t\t\twhat his expenditure would be for that period, for he himself was willing for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe payment of a smaller sum than that to evacuate  at once; these words caused\n\t\t\t\t\tAutophradates to ponder and led him to abandon the siege. Now equality of property among the citizens is\n\t\t\t\t\tcertainly one of the factors that contribute to the avoidance of party faction;\n\t\t\t\t\tit is not however a particularly important one. For the upper classes may resent\n\t\t\t\t\tit on the ground that their merits are not equal, owing to which we actually see\n\t\t\t\t\tthem often attacking the government and rebelling; and also the\n\t\t\t\t\tbaseness of human beings is a thing insatiable, and though at the first a dole\n\t\t\t\t\tof only two obols is enough,\n\t\t\t\t\tyet when this has now become an established custom, they always want more, until\n\t\t\t\t\tthey get to an unlimited amount; for appetite is in its nature unlimited, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe majority of mankind live for the satisfaction of appetite. The starting-point in such matters\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, rather than levelling estates, is to train those that are respectable\n\t\t\t\t\tby nature so that they may not wish for excessive wealth, and to contrive that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe base may not be able to do so, and this is secured if they are inferior in\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber and not unjustly treated. And also we cannot approve what Phaleas has\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid about equality of property, for he makes the citizens equal in respect of\n\t\t\t\t\tlanded estate only, but wealth also consists in slaves and cattle and money, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is an abundance of property in the shape of what is called furniture; we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust therefore either seek to secure equality or some moderate regulation as\n\t\t\t\t\tregards all these things, or we must permit all forms of wealth. And it is clear from Phaleas's legislation\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he makes the citizen-population a small one, inasmuch as all the artisans\n\t\t\t\t\tare to be publicly owned slaves and are not to furnish any complement of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen-body. But if it is proper to have public slaves, the laborers employed\n\t\t\t\t\tupon the public works ought to be of that status as is the case at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t and as Diophantus once\n\t\t\t\t\ttried to institute at .These remarks\n\t\t\t\t\tmay serve fairly well to indicate such meritsand defects as may be contained in the constitution of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhaleas.Hippodamus son of Euryphon, a Milesian\n\t\t\t\t\twho invented the division of cities into blocks and cut up , and who also became somewhat\n\t\t\t\t\teccentric in his general mode of life owing to a desire for distinction, so that\n\t\t\t\t\tsome people thought that he lived too fussily, with a quantity of hair and expensive ornaments, and also a quantity of cheap yet warm\n\t\t\t\t\tclothes not only in winter but also in the summer periods, and who wished to be\n\t\t\t\t\ta man of learning in natural science generally, was the first man not\n\t\t\t\t\tengaged in politics who attempted to speak on the subject of the best form of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution. His system was for a\n\t\t\t\t\tcity with a population of ten thousand, divided into three classes; for he made\n\t\t\t\t\tone class of artisans, one of farmers, and the third the class that fought for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe state in war and was the armed class. He divided the land into three parts,\n\t\t\t\t\tone sacred, one public and one private: sacred land to supply the customary\n\t\t\t\t\tofferings to the gods, common land to provide the warrior class with food, and\n\t\t\t\t\tprivate land to be owned by the farmers. He thought that there are only three\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisions of the law, since the matters about which lawsuits take place are\n\t\t\t\t\tthree in numberoutrage, damage, homicide. He also proposed to establish one supreme court of\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice, to which were to be carried up all the cases at law thought to have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen decided wrongly, and this court he made to consist of certain selected\n\t\t\t\t\telders. He held that the verdicts in the courts ought not to be given\n\t\t\t\t\tby ballot, but that each juryman should bring a tablet on which if he found a\n\t\t\t\t\tsimple verdict of guilty he should write the penalty, and if simply not guilty\n\t\t\t\t\tleave a blank, but if he found the prisoner guilty on some counts but not on\n\t\t\t\t\tothers he should state this; for the present state of the law he thought\n\t\t\t\t\tunsatisfactory, since it forces jurors to commit perjury by giving either the\n\t\t\t\t\tone verdict or the other. He\n\t\t\t\t\tproposed a law that those who discovered something of advantage to the state\n\t\t\t\t\tshould receive honor, and that the children of those who died in war should have\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir maintenance from the state, in the belief that this had never yet been\n\t\t\t\t\tprovided by law among other peoplebut as a matter of fact this law\n\t\t\t\t\texists at present both at  and\n\t\t\t\t\tin others of the cities. The governing officials were all to be chosen by the\n\t\t\t\t\tassembly of the people, and this he made to consist of the three classes of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcity; and the officials elected were to superintend the business of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunity and the affairs of foreign residents and of orphans. These then are\n\t\t\t\t\tthe greatest number and the most noteworthy of the provisions in the system of\n\t\t\t\t\tHippodamus. But doubt might be\n\t\t\t\t\traised first of all about the division of the general mass of the citizens. The\n\t\t\t\t\tartisans, the farmers and the military class all participate in the government,\n\t\t\t\t\tthough the farmers have not got arms and the artisans neither arms nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tland,which makes them almost the\n\t\t\t\t\tslaves of those who possess the arms. Therefore for them to share in all the\n\t\t\t\t\toffices is impossible for it is inevitable that both military\n\t\t\t\t\tcommanders and civic guards and in general the most important offices should be\n\t\t\t\t\tappointed from those that have the arms; but if they do not share in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe government of the state, how is it possible for them to be friendly towards\n\t\t\t\t\tthe constitution? But it may be said\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the ruling class as possessing the arms is bound to be stronger than both\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses. But this is not easy if they are not numerous and if this be the case,\n\t\t\t\t\twhy should the other classes participate in the government and control the\n\t\t\t\t\tappointment of the rulers? Again,\n\t\t\t\t\twhat use are the farmers to the state? artisans there must necessarily be\n\t\t\t\t\tfor every state requires artisans, and they can make a\n\t\t\t\t\tliving as in the other states from the practice of their craft; but as for the\n\t\t\t\t\tfarmers, although it would have been reasonable for them to be a portion of the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate if they provided the class possessing the arms with its food, as it is\n\t\t\t\t\tthey have private land of their own and farm it for themselves. And again, if the common land from which\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who fight for the state are to have their food is to be farmed by\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, the military class would not be different from the agricultural, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe legislator intends it to be; while if the cultivators of the common land are\n\t\t\t\t\tto be a different set of people from both those who cultivate the private farms\n\t\t\t\t\tand the soldiers, this will be yet a forth section of the state, holding no part\n\t\t\t\t\tin it but quite estranged from the government. But yet if one is to make those\n\t\t\t\t\twho cultivate the private and the common land the same people, the amount of the\n\t\t\t\t\tproduce from the farms which each man will cultivate will be scanty for two\n\t\t\t\t\thouseholds, and moreover why are they not both to take food for themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tand to supply it to the soldiers direct from the land and from the same\n\t\t\t\t\tallotments? All these points\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore involve much confusion. Also the law about trials is\n\t\t\t\t\tunsatisfactorythe requirement that the verdict shall be given on\n\t\t\t\t\tseparate counts when the charge in the indictment is single, and the conversion\n\t\t\t\t\tof the juror into an arbitrator. A qualified verdict is practicable in an\n\t\t\t\t\tarbitration even when there are several arbitrators for they confer\n\t\t\t\t\twith one another about their verdict, but it is not practicable in the\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw-courts, but the contrary to this is actually provided for by most lawgivers,\n\t\t\t\t\twho prohibit consultation between the jurymen. Then the verdict will inevitably be a confused one when\n\t\t\t\t\tthe juror thinks that the defendant is liable for damages but not in so large an\n\t\t\t\t\tamount as the plaintiff claims; for the plaintiff will sue for twenty minae and the juror will adjudge ten minae\n\t\t\t\t\tor the former some larger and the latter some smaller sum,\n\t\t\t\t\tand another juror five minae, and yet another four and so they will\n\t\t\t\t\tobviously go on making fractions, while others will award the whole\n\t\t\t\t\tsum, and others nothing; what then will be the method of counting the votes?\n\t\t\t\t\tAgain, nobody compels the juror to commit perjury who, if the indictment has\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen drawn in simple form, gives a simple verdict of acquittal or condemnation,\n\t\t\t\t\tand gives it justly; for the jurorwho\n\t\t\t\t\tgives a verdict of acquittal does not give judgement that the defendant owes\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing, but that he does not owe the twenty minae for which he is sued; it is\n\t\t\t\t\tonly the juror who gives a verdict condemning the defendant when he does not\n\t\t\t\t\tthink that he owes twenty minae who commits perjury. As for the view that an honor ought to be awarded to those\n\t\t\t\t\twho invent something advantageous to the state, legislation to this effect is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot safe, but only specious to the ear; for it involves malicious prosecutions\n\t\t\t\t\tand, it may even happen, constitutional upheavals. And the matter leads to\n\t\t\t\t\tanother problem and a different inquiry: some persons raise the question whether\n\t\t\t\t\tto alter the ancestral laws, supposing another law is better, is harmful or\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantageous to states. Hence it is not easy to give a speedy agreement to the\n\t\t\t\t\tabove proposal to honor reformers, if really it is disadvantageous to alter the\n\t\t\t\t\tlaws; yet it is possible that persons may bring forward the repeal of laws or of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe constitution as a benefit to the community. And since we have made mention of this question, it will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe better if we set out a few further observations about it, for, as we said, it\n\t\t\t\t\tinvolves difficulty. And it might be thought that it would be better for\n\t\t\t\t\talteration to take place; at all events in the other fields of knowledge this\n\t\t\t\t\thas proved beneficialfor example, medicine has been improved by being\n\t\t\t\t\taltered from the ancestral system, and gymnastic training, and in general all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe arts and faculties so that since statesmanship also is to be counted as one\n\t\t\t\t\tof these, it is clear that the same thing necessarily holds good in regard to it\n\t\t\t\t\tas well. And it might be said that a sign of this has occurred in the actual\n\t\t\t\t\tevents of history, for one might argue the laws of ancient\n\t\t\t\t\ttimes were too simple and uncivilized: the Hellenes, for instance, used both to\n\t\t\t\t\tcarry arms and to purchase their wives from one another, and all the survivals of the customs of antiquity\n\t\t\t\t\texisting anywhere are utterly foolish, as for example at Cyme there is\n\t\t\t\t\ta law relating to trials for murder, that if the prosecutor on the charge of\n\t\t\t\t\tmurder produces a certain number of his own relatives as witnesses, the\n\t\t\t\t\tdefendant is guilty of the murder. And in general all men really seek what is\n\t\t\t\t\tgood, not what was customary with their forefathers; and it is probable that\n\t\t\t\t\tprimitive mankind, whether sprung from the earth or the survivors of some\n\t\t\t\t\tdestructive cataclysm, were\n\t\t\t\t\tjust like ordinary foolish people, as indeed is actually said of the earth-born\n\t\t\t\t\trace, so that it is odd that we should abide by their notions. Moreover even\n\t\t\t\t\twritten codes of law may with advantage not be left unaltered. For just as in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other arts as well, so with the structure of the state it is impossible that\n\t\t\t\t\tit should have been framed aright in all its details; for it must of necessity\n\t\t\t\t\tbe couched in general terms, but our actions deal with particular things. These\n\t\t\t\t\tconsiderations therefore make it clear that it is proper for some laws sometimes\n\t\t\t\t\tto be altered. But if we consider\n\t\t\t\t\tthe matter in another way, it would seem to be a thing that needs much caution.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor when it is the case that the improvement would be small, but it is a bad\n\t\t\t\t\tthing to accustom men to repeal the laws lightly, it is clear that some mistakes\n\t\t\t\t\tboth of the legislator and of the magistrate should be passed over; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople will not be as much benefited by making an alteration as they will be\n\t\t\t\t\tharmed by becoming accustomed to distrust their rulers. Also, the example from the case of the arts is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmistake,as to change the practice\n\t\t\t\t\tof an art is a different thing from altering a law; for the law has no power to\n\t\t\t\t\tcompel obedience beside the force of custom, and custom only grows up in long\n\t\t\t\t\tlapse of time, so that lightly to change from the existing laws to other new\n\t\t\t\t\tlaws is to weaken the power of the law. Again, even if alteration of the laws is\n\t\t\t\t\tproper, are all the laws to be open to alteration, and in every form of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, or not? and is any chance person to be competent to introduce\n\t\t\t\t\talterations or only certain people? for there is a great difference between\n\t\t\t\t\tthese alternatives. Therefore let us abandon this inquiry for the present, since\n\t\t\t\t\tit belongs to other occasions.On the subject of the constitution of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t and that of , and virtually in regard to the other\n\t\t\t\t\tforms of constitution also, the questions that arise for consideration are two,\n\t\t\t\t\tone whether their legal structure has any feature that is admirable or the\n\t\t\t\t\treverse in comparison with the best system, another whether it contains any\n\t\t\t\t\tprovision that is really opposed to the fundamental principle and character of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe constitution that the founders had in view.Now it is a thing admitted\n\t\t\t\t\tthat a state that is to be well governed must be provided with leisure from\n\t\t\t\t\tmenial occupations; but how this is to be provided it is not easy to ascertain.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe serf class in  repeatedly\n\t\t\t\t\trose against its masters, and so did the Helots at , where they are like an enemy\n\t\t\t\t\tconstantly sitting in wait for the disasters of the Spartiates. Nothing of the kind has hitherto occurred\n\t\t\t\t\tin , the reason perhaps being that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe neighboring cities, even when at war with one another, in no instance\n\t\t\t\t\tally themselves with the rebels, because as they themselves also possess a serf\n\t\t\t\t\tclass this would not be for their interest; whereas the Laconians were entirely\n\t\t\t\t\tsurrounded by hostile neighbors, Argives, Messenians and Arcadians. For with the\n\t\t\t\t\tThessalians too the serf risings originally began because they were still at war\n\t\t\t\t\twith their neighbors, the Achaeans, Perraebi and Magnesians. Also, apart from other drawbacks, the mere\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity of policing a serf class is an irksome burdenthe problem of\n\t\t\t\t\thow intercourse with them is to be carried on: if allowed freedom they grow\n\t\t\t\t\tinsolent and claim equal rights with their masters, and if made to live a hard\n\t\t\t\t\tlife they plot against them and hate them. It is clear therefore that those\n\t\t\t\t\twhose helot-system works out in this way do not discover the best mode of\n\t\t\t\t\ttreating the problem. Again, the\n\t\t\t\t\tfreedom in regard to women is detrimental both in regard to the purpose of the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution and in regard to the happiness of the state. For just as man and\n\t\t\t\t\twife are part of a household, it is clear that the state also is divided nearly\n\t\t\t\t\tin half into its male and female population, so that in all constitutions in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the position of the women is badly regulated one half of the state must be\n\t\t\t\t\tdeemed to have been neglected in framing the law. And this has taken place in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe state under consideration,for the\n\t\t\t\t\tlawgiver wishing the whole city to be of strong character displays his intention\n\t\t\t\t\tclearly in relation to the men, but in the case of the women has entirely\n\t\t\t\t\tneglected the matter; for they live dissolutely in respect of every sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tdissoluteness, and luxuriously. So\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the inevitable result is that in a state thus constituted wealth is held in\n\t\t\t\t\thonor, especially if it is the case that the people are under the sway of their\n\t\t\t\t\twomen, as most of the military and warlike races are, except the Celts and such\n\t\t\t\t\tother races as have openly held in honor passionate friendship between males.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor it appears that the original teller of the legend had good reason for\n\t\t\t\t\tuniting Ares with Aphrodite, for all men of martial spirit appear to be\n\t\t\t\t\tattracted to the companionship either of male associates or of women. Hence this characteristic existed among the\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartans, and in the time of their empire many things were controlled by the\n\t\t\t\t\twomen; yet what difference does it make whether the women rule or the rulers are\n\t\t\t\t\truled by the women? The result is the same. And although bravery is of service\n\t\t\t\t\tfor none of the regular duties of life, but if at all, in war, even in this\n\t\t\t\t\trespect the Spartans' women were most harmful; and they showed this at the time\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Theban invasion, for they rendered no useful\n\t\t\t\t\tservice, as the women do in other states, while they caused more confusion than\n\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy. It is true therefore that\n\t\t\t\t\tat the outset the freedom allowed to women at  seems to have come about with good reason, for the\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartans used to be away in exile abroad for long periods on account of their\n\t\t\t\t\tmilitary expeditions, both when fighting the war against the Argives and again\n\t\t\t\t\tduring the war against the Arcadians and Messenians; but when they had turned to\n\t\t\t\t\tpeaceful pursuits, although they handed over themselves to the lawgiver already\n\t\t\t\t\tprepared for obedience by military life for this has many elements of\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue, as for the women it is said that Lycurgus did attempt to bring\n\t\t\t\t\tthem under the laws, but since they resisted he gave it up. So the Spartan women are, it is true, responsible\n\t\t\t\t\tfor what took place, and therefore manifestly for this mistake among the rest;\n\t\t\t\t\talthough for our own part we are not considering the question who deserves\n\t\t\t\t\texcuse or does not, but what is the right or wrong mode of action. But, as was\n\t\t\t\t\talso said before, errors as regards the status of women seem not only to cause a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain unseemliness in the actual conduct of the state but to contribute in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome degree to undue love of money. For next to the things just spoken of one might censure the Spartan\n\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions with respect to the unequal distribution of wealth. It has come\n\t\t\t\t\tabout that some of the Spartans own too much property and some extremely little;\n\t\t\t\t\towing to which the land has fallen into few hands, and this has also been badly\n\t\t\t\t\tregulated by the laws;for the\n\t\t\t\t\tlawgiver made it dishonorable to sell a family's existing estate, and did so\n\t\t\t\t\trightly, but he granted liberty to alienate land at will by gift or bequest; yet\n\t\t\t\t\tthe result that has happened was bound to follow in the one case as well as in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other. And also nearly\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo-fifths of the whole area of the country is owned by women, because of the\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of women who inherit estates and the practice of giving large dowries;\n\t\t\t\t\tyet it would have been better if dowries had been prohibited by law or limited\n\t\t\t\t\tto a small or moderate amount . . . But as it is he\n\t\t\t\t\tis allowed to give an heiress in marriage to whomever he likes; and if he dies\n\t\t\t\t\twithout having made directions as to this by will, whoever he leaves as his\n\t\t\t\t\texecutor bestows her upon whom he chooses. As a result of this although the country is capable of supporting fifteen hundred\n\t\t\t\t\tcavalry and thirty thousand heavy-armed troopers, they numbered not even a\n\t\t\t\t\tthousand. And the defective nature\n\t\t\t\t\tof their system of land-tenure has been proved by the actual facts of history:\n\t\t\t\t\tthe state did not succeed in enduring a single blow, but perished owing to the smallness of its population. They have\n\t\t\t\t\ta tradition that in the earlier reigns they used to admit foreigners to their\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizenship, with the result that dearth of population did not occur in those\n\t\t\t\t\tdays, although they were at war for a long period; and it is stated that at one\n\t\t\t\t\ttime the Spartiates numbered as many as ten thousand. However, whether this is\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue or not, it is better for a state's male population to be kept up by\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasures to equalize property. The\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw in relation to parentage is also somewhat adverse to the correction of this\n\t\t\t\t\tevil. For the lawgiver desiring to make the Spartiates as numerous as\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible holds out inducements to the citizens to have as many children as\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible: for they have a law releasing the man who has been father of three\n\t\t\t\t\tsons from military service, and exempting the father of four from all taxes. Yet\n\t\t\t\t\tit is clear that if a number of sons are born and the land is correspondingly\n\t\t\t\t\tdivided there will inevitably come to be many poor men.Moreover the\n\t\t\t\t\tregulations for the Ephorate are also bad. For this office has\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolute control over their most important affairs, but the Ephors are appointed\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the entire people, so that quite poor men often happen to get into the\n\t\t\t\t\toffice, who owing to their poverty used to be easily bought. This was often manifested\n\t\t\t\t\tin earlier times, and also lately in the affair at ; for certain Ephors were corrupted with money and so far\n\t\t\t\t\tas lay in their power ruined the whole state. And because the office was too\n\t\t\t\t\tpowerful, and equal to a tyranny, the kings also were compelled to cultivate\n\t\t\t\t\tpopular favor, so that in this way too the constitution was jointly injured, for\n\t\t\t\t\tout of an aristocracy came to be evolved a democracy. Thus this office does, it is true, hold together the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutionfor the common people keep quiet because they have a\n\t\t\t\t\tshare in the highest office of state, so that whether this is due to the\n\t\t\t\t\tlawgiver orhas come about by chance,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Ephorate is advantageous for the conduct of affairs; for if a constitution\n\t\t\t\t\tis to be preserved, all the sections of the state must wish it to exist and to\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinue on the same lines; so the kings are in this frame of mind owing to\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir own honorable rank, the nobility owing to the office of the Elders, which\n\t\t\t\t\tis a prize of virtue, and the common people because of the Ephorate, which is\n\t\t\t\t\tappointed from the whole populationbut yet the Ephorate, though rightly open to all the\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens, ought not to be elected as it is now, for the method is too\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchildish. And further the Ephors have jurisdiction in lawsuits\n\t\t\t\t\tof high importance, although they are any chance people, so that it would be\n\t\t\t\t\tbetter if they did not decide cases on their own judgement but by written rules\n\t\t\t\t\tand according to the laws. Also the mode of life of the Ephors is not in\n\t\t\t\t\tconformity with the aim of the state, for it is itself too luxurious, whereas in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case of the other citizens the prescribed life goes too far in the direction\n\t\t\t\t\tof harshness, so that they are unable to endure it, and secretly desert the law\n\t\t\t\t\tand enjoy the pleasures of the body. Also their regulations for the office of the Elders are not good; it is true\n\t\t\t\t\tthat if these were persons of a high class who had been adequately trained in\n\t\t\t\t\tmanly valor, one might perhaps say that the institution was advantageous to the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate, although their life-tenure of the judgeship in important trials is indeed\n\t\t\t\t\ta questionable feature for there is old age of mind as well as of\n\t\t\t\t\tbody; but as their education has been on such lines that\n\t\t\t\t\teven the lawgiver himself cannot trust in them as men of virtue, it is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdangerous institution. And it is\n\t\t\t\t\tknown that those who have been admitted to this office take bribes and betray\n\t\t\t\t\tmany of the public interests by favoritism; so that it would be better if they\n\t\t\t\t\twere not exempt from having to render an account of their office, but at present\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are. And it might be held that the magistracy of the Ephors serves to hold\n\t\t\t\t\tall the offices to account; but this gives altogether too much to the Ephorate,\n\t\t\t\t\tand it is not the way in which, as we maintain, officials ought to be called to\n\t\t\t\t\taccount. Again, the procedure in the election of the Elders as a mode of\n\t\t\t\t\tselection is not only childish, but it is wrong that one who is to be the holder\n\t\t\t\t\tof this honorable office should canvass for it, for the man worthy of the office\n\t\t\t\t\tought to hold it whether he wants to or not. But as it is the lawgiver clearly does the same here as in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rest of the constitution: he makes the citizens ambitious and has used this\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the election of the Elders, for nobody would ask for office if he were not\n\t\t\t\t\tambitious; yet surely ambition and love of money are the motives that bring\n\t\t\t\t\tabout almost the greatest part of the voluntary wrongdoing that takes place\n\t\t\t\t\tamong mankind. As to monarchy, the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion whether it is not or is an advantageous institution for states to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossessmay be left to another\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussion; but at all events it would be advantageous that kings should not be\n\t\t\t\t\tappointed as they are now, but chosen in each case with regard to their own life\n\t\t\t\t\tand conduct. But it is clear that even the lawgiver himself does not suppose\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he can make the kings men of high character: at all events he distrusts\n\t\t\t\t\tthem as not being persons of sufficient worth owing to which the Spartans used\n\t\t\t\t\tto send kings who were enemies as colleagues on embassies, and thought that the\n\t\t\t\t\tsafety of the state depended on division between the kings. Also the regulations for the the public mess-tables\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled Phiditia have been badly laid down by their originator. The revenue for\n\t\t\t\t\tthese ought to come rather from public funds, as in ; but among the Spartans everybody has to contribute,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough some of them are very poor and unable to find money for this charge, so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the result is the opposite of what the lawgiver purposed. For he intends\n\t\t\t\t\tthe organization of the common tables to be democratic, but when regulated by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe law in this manner it works out as by no means democratic; for it is not\n\t\t\t\t\teasy for the very poor to participate, yet their ancestral regulation of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizenship is that it is not to belong to one who is unable to pay this tax.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe law about the Admirals has\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen criticized by some other writers also, and rightly criticized; for it acts\n\t\t\t\t\tas a cause of sedition, since in addition to the kings who are military\n\t\t\t\t\tcommanders the office of Admiral stands almost as another kingship. Another\n\t\t\t\t\tcriticism that may be made against the fundamental principle of the lawgiver\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis one that Plato has made in the . The\n\t\t\t\t\tentire system of the laws is directed towards one part of virtue only, military\n\t\t\t\t\tvalor, because this is serviceable for conquest. Owing to this they remained\n\t\t\t\t\tsecure while at war, but began to decline when they had won an empire, because\n\t\t\t\t\tthey did not know how to live a life of leisure, and had been trained in no\n\t\t\t\t\tother form of training more important than the art of war. And another error no less serious than that one is\n\t\t\t\t\tthis: they think that the coveted prizes of life are won by valor more than by\n\t\t\t\t\tcowardice, and in this they are right, yet they imagine wrongly that these\n\t\t\t\t\tprizes are worth more than the valor that wins them. The public finance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t is also badly regulated:\n\t\t\t\t\twhen compelled to carry on wars on a large scale she has nothing in the state\n\t\t\t\t\ttreasury, and the Spartiates pay war taxes badly because, as most of the land is\n\t\t\t\t\towned by them, they do not scrutinize each other's contributions. And the\n\t\t\t\t\tlawgiver has achieved the opposite result to what is advantageoushe\n\t\t\t\t\thas made the state poor and the individual citizen covetous.So much for a discussion of the constitution of : for these are the main points in it\n\t\t\t\t\tfor criticism.The Cretan\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution approximates to that of , but though in a few points it is not worse framed, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe larger part it has a less perfect finish. For the Spartan constitution\n\t\t\t\t\tappears and indeed is actually stated to have been copied in most of its provisions from the\n\t\t\t\t\tCretan; and as a rule old things have been less fully elaborated than newer\n\t\t\t\t\tones. For it is said that when Lycurgus relinquished his post as guardian of\n\t\t\t\t\tKing Charilaus and went abroad, he\n\t\t\t\t\tsubsequently passed most of his time in  because of the relationship between the Cretans and the\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartans; for the Lyctians were colonists from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t, and the settlers that\n\t\t\t\t\twent out to the colony found the system of laws already existing among the\n\t\t\t\t\tprevious inhabitants of the place; owing to which the neighboring villagers even\n\t\t\t\t\tnow use these laws in the same manner, in the belief that Minos first instituted this code of laws.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd also the island appears to\n\t\t\t\t\thave been designed by nature and to be well situated to be under Greek rule, as\n\t\t\t\t\tit lies across the whole of the sea, round which almost all the Greeks are\n\t\t\t\t\tsettled; for  is only a short\n\t\t\t\t\tdistance from the  in one\n\t\t\t\t\tdirection, and from the part of \n\t\t\t\t\taround Triopium and from  in the\n\t\t\t\t\tother. Owing to this Minos won the empire of the sea, and made some of the\n\t\t\t\t\tislands subject to him and settled colonies in others, but finally when making\n\t\t\t\t\tan attack on  he ended his life\n\t\t\t\t\tthere near Camicus.The Cretan organization is on the same lines as that of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t. In  the land is tilled by the Helots and\n\t\t\t\t\tin  by the serfs; and also\n\t\t\t\t\tboth have public mess-tables, and in old days the Spartans called them not\n\t\t\t\t\tphiditia but men's messes, as the\n\t\t\t\t\tCretans do, which is a proof that they came from . And so also did the system of government; for the Ephors\n\t\t\t\t\thave the same power as the magistrates called Cosmi in , except that the Ephors are five in\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber and the Cosmi ten; and the Elders at  are equal in number to the Elders whom the Cretans call\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Council; and monarchy existed in former times, but then the Cretans\n\t\t\t\t\tabolished it, and the Cosmi hold the leadership in war; and all are members of the Assembly, though it has\n\t\t\t\t\tno powers except the function of confirming by vote the resolutions already\n\t\t\t\t\tformed by the Elders and the Cosmi.Now the Cretan\n\t\t\t\t\tarrangements for the public mess-tables are better than the Spartan; for at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t each citizen pays a fixed\n\t\t\t\t\tpoll-tax, failing which he is prevented by law from taking part in the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment, as has been said before; but in  the system is more communal, for out of all the crops and\n\t\t\t\t\tcattle produced from the public lands, and the tributes paid by the serfs, one\n\t\t\t\t\tpart is assigned for the worship of the gods and the maintenance of the public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservices,and the other for the\n\t\t\t\t\tpublic mess-tables, so that all the citizens are maintained from the common\n\t\t\t\t\tfunds, women and children as well as men; and the lawgiver has devised many wise measures to secure\n\t\t\t\t\tthe benefit of moderation at table, and the segregation of the women in order\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they may not bear many children, for which purpose he instituted\n\t\t\t\t\tassociation with the male sex, as to which there will be another occasion to\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider whether it was a bad thing or a good one. That the regulations for the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon mess-tables therefore are better in  than at  is manifest; but the regulations for the Cosmi are even\n\t\t\t\t\tworse than those regarding the Ephors. For the evil attaching to the office of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Ephors belongs to the Cosmi also, as the post is filled by any chance\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons, while the benefit conferred on the government by this office at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t is lacking in . At , as the election is made from all the citizens, the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon people sharing in the highest office desire the maintenance of the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, but in  they do not\n\t\t\t\t\telect the Cosmi from all the citizens but from certain clans, and the Elders\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom those who have held the office of Cosmos, about which regulations the same comments might be made as\n\t\t\t\t\tabout what takes place at :\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir freedom from being called to account and their tenure for life gives them\n\t\t\t\t\tgreater rank than their merit deserves, and their administration of their office\n\t\t\t\t\tat their own discretion and not under the guidance of a written code is\n\t\t\t\t\tdangerous. And the fact that the common people quietly tolerate their exclusion\n\t\t\t\t\tis no proof that the arrangement is a sound one; for the Cosmi unlike the Ephors\n\t\t\t\t\tmake no sort of profit, as they live in an island remote from any people to\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrupt them. Also the remedy which they employ for this defect is a curious one, and less characteristic of a republic\n\t\t\t\t\tthan of a dynasty:\n\t\t\t\t\t\toften the Cosmi are expelled by\n\t\t\t\t\ta conspiracy formed among some of their actual colleagues or the private\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens. Also the Cosmi are allowed to resign during their term of office. Now\n\t\t\t\t\tit would be preferable for all these expedients to be put in force by law rather\n\t\t\t\t\tthan at the discretion of individuals, for that is a dangerous principle. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthe worst expedient of all is that of the suspension of the office of Cosmi,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is often brought about by members of the powerful class who wish to escape\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing punished; this proves that the constitution has a republican element,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough it is not actually a republic but rather a dynasty. And the nobles frequently form parties\n\t\t\t\t\tamong the common people and among their friends and so bring about a suspension\n\t\t\t\t\tof government, and form factions and engage in war with\n\t\t\t\t\tone another. Yet such a state of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings is virtually the same as if for a period of time the state underwent an\n\t\t\t\t\tentire revolution, and the bonds of civil society were loosened.And it is a precarious position for a state to be in,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen those who wish to attack it also have the power to do so. But, as has been\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid, it is saved by its locality; for distance has had the same effect as\n\t\t\t\t\t\talien-acts. A\n\t\t\t\t\tresult of this is that with the Cretans the serf population stands firm, whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Helots often revolt; for the Cretanstake no part in foreign empire, and also the island has only\n\t\t\t\t\tlately been invaded by warfare from abroad, rendering manifest the weakness of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe legal system there.Let this suffice for our\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussion of this form of constitution. also appears to have a good\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, with many outstanding features as compared with those of other\n\t\t\t\t\tnations, but most nearly resembling the Spartan in some points. For these three\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions are in a way near to one another and are widely different from the\n\t\t\t\t\tothersthe Cretan, the Spartan and, thirdly, that of . Many regulations at  are good; and a proof of a\n\t\t\t\t\twell-regulated constitution is that the populace willingly remain faithful to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe constitutional system, and that neither civil strife has arisen in any\n\t\t\t\t\tdegree worth mentioning, nor yet a tyrant.Points in which the\n\t\t\t\t\tCarthaginian constitution resembles the Spartan are the common mess-tables of\n\t\t\t\t\tits Comradeships corresponding to the Phiditia, and the magistracy of the\n\t\t\t\t\tHundred and Four corresponding to the Ephors except one point of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperioritythe Ephors are drawn from any class, but the Carthaginians\n\t\t\t\t\telect this magistracy by merit; the kings and the council of Elders\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrespond to the kings and Elders at , and it is another superior feature that the\n\t\t\t\t\tCarthaginian kings are not confined to the same family and that one of no\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular distinction, and also that if any family distinguishes itself . .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t. the Elders are to be\n\t\t\t\t\tchosen from these rather than by age; for as they are put in control of\n\t\t\t\t\timportant matters, if they are men of no value they do great harm, and they\n\t\t\t\t\thave already injured the Spartan State.Most of the points\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore in the Carthaginian system that would be criticized on the ground of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir divergences happen to be common to all the constitutions of which we have\n\t\t\t\t\tspoken; but the features open to criticism as judged by the principle of an\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracy or republic are some of them departures in the direction of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy and others in the direction of oligarchy. The reference of some\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters and not of others to the popular assembly rests with the kings in\n\t\t\t\t\tconsultation with the Elders in case they agree unanimously, but\n\t\t\t\t\tfailing that, these matters also lie with the people; and when the kings introduce business in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe assembly, they do not merely let the people sit and listen to the decisions\n\t\t\t\t\tthat have been taken by their rulers, but the people have the sovereign\n\t\t\t\t\tdecision, and anybody who wishes may speak against the proposals introduced, a\n\t\t\t\t\tright that does not exist under the other constitutions. The appointment by co-optation of the Boards of\n\t\t\t\t\tFive which control many important matters, and the election by these boards of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe supreme magistracy of the Hundred, and also their longer tenure of authority\n\t\t\t\t\tthan that of any other officers for they are in power after they have\n\t\t\t\t\tgone out of office and before they have actually entered upon it are\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchical features; their receiving no pay and not being chosen by lot and\n\t\t\t\t\tother similar regulations must be set down as aristocratic, and so must the fact\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the members of the Boards are the judges in all lawsuits,instead of different suits being tried by different\n\t\t\t\t\tcourts as at . But the Carthaginian system diverges from\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracy in the direction of oligarchy most signally in respect of a certain\n\t\t\t\t\tidea that is shared by the mass of mankind; they think that the rulers should be\n\t\t\t\t\tchosen not only for their merit but also for their wealth, as it is not possible\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a poor man to govern well or to have leisure for his duties. If therefore\n\t\t\t\t\telection by wealth is oligarchical and election by merit aristocratic, this will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe a third system exhibited in the organization of the constitution of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t, for there elections\n\t\t\t\t\tare made with an eye to these two qualifications, and especially elections to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe most important offices, those of the kings and of the generals. But it must be held that this divergence\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom aristocracy is an error on the part of a lawgiver; for one of the most\n\t\t\t\t\timportant points to keep in view from the outset is that the best citizens may\n\t\t\t\t\tbe able to have leisure and may not have to engage in any unseemly occupation,\n\t\t\t\t\tnot only when in office but also when living in private life. And if it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary to look to the question of means for the sake of leisure, it is a bad\n\t\t\t\t\tthing that the greatest offices of state, the kingship and the generalship,\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be for sale. For this law makes wealth more honored than worth, and\n\t\t\t\t\trenders the whole state avaricious; and whatever the holders of supreme power deem honorable, the opinion of the\n\t\t\t\t\tother citizens also is certain to follow them, and a state in which virtue is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot held in the highest honor cannot be securely governed by an\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracy. And it is probable that those who purchase office will learn by\n\t\t\t\t\tdegrees to make a profit out of it, when they hold office for money spent; for\n\t\t\t\t\tit would be odd if a man of small means but respectable should want to make a\n\t\t\t\t\tprofit but an inferior person when he has spent money to get elected should not\n\t\t\t\t\twant to. Hence the persons who should be in office are those most capable of\n\t\t\t\t\tholding office. And even if the lawgiver neglected to secure comfortable means\n\t\t\t\t\tfor respectable people, it would at all events be better that he should provide\n\t\t\t\t\tfor their leisure while in office.And it might also be thought a bad thing\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the same person to hold several offices, which is considered a distinction\n\t\t\t\t\tat . One man one job is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best rule for efficiency, and the lawgiver ought to see that this may be\n\t\t\t\t\tsecured, and not appoint the same man to play the flute and make shoes. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\texcept in a small city it is more statesmanlike for a larger number to share in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe offices and more democratic, for it is fairer to all, as we said, and also\n\t\t\t\t\tfunctions are performed better and more quickly when separate than by the same\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople. This is clear in military and naval matters; for in both of these\n\t\t\t\t\tdepartments command and subordination penetrate throughout almost the whole\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut\n\t\t\t\t\tthe constitution being oligarchical they best escape the dangers by being\n\t\t\t\t\twealthy, as they constantly send out a portion of the common people toappointments in the cities; by this means\n\t\t\t\t\tthey heal the social sore and make the constitution stable. However, this is the\n\t\t\t\t\tachievement of fortune, whereas freedom from civil strife ought to be secured by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe lawgiver; but as it is, suppose some misfortune occurs and the multitude of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subject class revolts, there is no remedy provided by the laws to restore\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttranquillity.This then is the character of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Spartan, Cretan and Carthaginian constitutions, which are justly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamous.Of those that have put forward views about politics, some have\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken no part in any political activities whatever but have passed their whole\n\t\t\t\t\tlife as private citizens; and something has been said about almost all the\n\t\t\t\t\twriters of this class about whom there is anything noteworthy. Some on the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand have been lawgivers, either for their native cities or even for certain\n\t\t\t\t\tforeign peoples, after having themselves been actively engaged in government;\n\t\t\t\t\tand of these some have been framers of laws only, and others of a constitution\n\t\t\t\t\talso, for instance Solon and Lycurgus, who instituted both laws and\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions. The Spartan constitution has been discussed. As for Solon, he is considered by some people to\n\t\t\t\t\thave been a good lawgiver, as having put an end to oligarchy when it was too\n\t\t\t\t\tunqualified and having liberated the people from slavery and restored the\n\t\t\t\t\tancestral democracy with a skilful blending of the constitution: the Council on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Areopagus being an oligarchic element, the elective magistracies\n\t\t\t\t\taristocratic and the law-courts democratic. And although really in regard to\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain of these features, the Council and the election of magistrates,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSolon seems merely to have abstained from destroying\n\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions that existed already, he does appear to have founded the democracy\n\t\t\t\t\tby constituting the jury-courts from all the citizens. For this he is actually blamed by some persons, as having\n\t\t\t\t\tdissolved the power of the other parts of the community by making the law-court,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich was elected by lot, all-powerful. For as the law-court grew strong, men\n\t\t\t\t\tcourted favor with the people as with a tyrant, and so brought the constitution\n\t\t\t\t\tto the present democracy; and Ephialtes and Pericles docked the power of the\n\t\t\t\t\tCouncil on the Areopagus, while Pericles instituted payment for serving in the\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw-courts, and in this manner finally the successive leaders of the people led\n\t\t\t\t\tthem on by growing stages to the present democracy. But this does not seem to\n\t\t\t\t\thave come about in accordance with the intention of Solon, but rather as a\n\t\t\t\t\tresult of accident for the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon people having been the cause of the naval victories at the time of the\n\t\t\t\t\tPersian invasion became proud and adopted bad men as popular leaders when the\n\t\t\t\t\trespectable classes opposed their policy; inasmuch as Solon for his\n\t\t\t\t\tpart appears to bestow only the minimum of power upon the people, the function\n\t\t\t\t\tof electing the magistrates and of calling them to account for if even\n\t\t\t\t\tthis were not under the control of the populace it would be a mere slave and a\n\t\t\t\t\tforeign enemy, whereas he appointed all the offices from the notable\n\t\t\t\t\tand the wealthy, the Five-hundred-bushel classand the Teamsters and a third property-class called the\n\t\t\t\t\tKnighthood; while the fourth class, the Thetes, were admitted to no office.\n\t\t\t\t\tLaws\n\t\t\t\t\twere given by Zaleucus to the Epizephyrian Locrians and by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCharondas of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t to his fellow-citizens\n\t\t\t\t\tand to the other Chalcidic cities on the coasts of Italy and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t. Some persons try to connect\n\t\t\t\t\tZaleucus and Charondas together: they say that Onomacritus first arose as an\n\t\t\t\t\table lawgiver, and that he was trained in , being a Locrian and travelling there to practise the art\n\t\t\t\t\tof soothsaying, and Thales became his companion, and Lycurgus and Zaleucus were\n\t\t\t\t\tpupils of Thales, and Charondas of Zaleucus; but these stories give too little\n\t\t\t\t\tattention to the dates. Philolaus of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t also arose as lawgiver\n\t\t\t\t\tat . Philolaus belonged by\n\t\t\t\t\tbirth to the Bacchiad family; he became the lover of Diocles the winner\n\t\t\t\t\tat , but when Diocles\n\t\t\t\t\tquitted the city because of his loathing for the passion of his mother Alcyone,\n\t\t\t\t\the went away to , and there\n\t\t\t\t\tthey both ended their life. Even now people still show their tombs, in full view\n\t\t\t\t\tof each other and one of them fully open to view in the direction of the\n\t\t\t\t\tCorinthian country but the other one not; for the story goes that they arranged to be buried in this\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner, Diocles owing to his hatred for his misfortune securing that the land of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t might not be visible\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom his tomb, and Philolaus that it might be from his. It was due then to\n\t\t\t\t\ta reason of this nature that they went to live at ; but Philolaus became the Thebans'\n\t\t\t\t\tlawgiver in regard to various matters, among others the size of\n\t\t\t\t\tfamilies,the laws called by the Thebans laws of adoption; about this\n\t\t\t\t\tPhilolaus enacted special legislation, in order that the number of the estates\n\t\t\t\t\tin land might be preserved. There is\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing special in the code of Charondas except the trials for false witness\n\t\t\t\t\tfor he was the first to introduce the procedure of\n\t\t\t\t\tdenunciation, but in the accuracy of his laws he is a more finished\n\t\t\t\t\tworkman even than the legislators of today. Peculiar to Phaleas is the measure\n\t\t\t\t\tfor equalizing properties; to Plato, community of wives and children and of property, and the common\n\t\t\t\t\tmeals for the women, and also the law about drunkenness, enacting that sober\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons are to be masters of the drinking-bouts, and the regulation for military\n\t\t\t\t\ttraining to make men ambidextrous during drill, on the ground that it is a\n\t\t\t\t\tmistake to have one of the two hands useful but the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuseless.There are laws\n\t\t\t\t\tof Draco, but he\n\t\t\t\t\tlegislated for an existing constitution, and there is nothing peculiar in his\n\t\t\t\t\tlaws that is worthy of mention, except their severity in imposing heavy\n\t\t\t\t\tpunishment. Pittacus also was a framer\n\t\t\t\t\tof laws, but not of a constitution; a special law of his is that if men commit\n\t\t\t\t\tany offence when drunk,they are to\n\t\t\t\t\tpay a larger fine than those who offend when sober; because since more men are\n\t\t\t\t\tinsolent when drunk than when sober he had regard not to the view that drunken\n\t\t\t\t\toffenders are to be shown more mercy, but to expediency. Androdamas of  also became lawgiver to the\n\t\t\t\t\tChalcidians in the direction of , and to him belong the laws dealing with cases of\n\t\t\t\t\tmurder and with heiresses; however one cannot mention any provision that is\n\t\t\t\t\tpeculiar to him.Let such be our examination of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe constitutional schemes actually in force and of those that have been\n\t\t\t\t\tproposed by certain persons."}}, {"@n": "3", "@type": "Book", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1274b", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "32", "@ed": "Bekker", "@unit": "line"}, {"@n": "1.1", "@ed": "P", "@unit": "Loeb

As it is,\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is a matter of dispute: a public act is spoken of by some people as the\n\t\t\t\t\taction of the state, others speak of it as the action not of the state but of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe oligarchy or the tyrant in power; and we see\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the activity of the statesman and lawgiver is entirely concerned with a\n\t\t\t\t\tstate as its object, and a constitution is a form of organization of the\n\t\t\t\t\tinhabitants of a state. But a state\n\t\t\t\t\tis a composite thing, in the same sense as any other of the things that are\n\t\t\t\t\twholes but consist of many parts; it is therefore clear that we must first\n\t\t\t\t\tinquire into the nature of a citizen; for a state is a collection of citizens,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso that we have to consider who is entitled to the name of\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen, and what the essential nature of a citizen is. For there is often a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference of opinion as to this: people do not all agree that the same person\n\t\t\t\t\tis a citizen; often somebody who would be a citizen in a democracy is not a\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen under an oligarchy. We need\n\t\t\t\t\tnot here consider those who acquire the title of citizen in some exceptional\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner, for example those who are citizens by adoption; and citizenship is not\n\t\t\t\t\tconstituted by domicile in a certain place for resident aliens and\n\t\t\t\t\tslaves share the domicile of citizens, nor are those citizens who\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipate in a common system of justice, conferring the right to defend an\n\t\t\t\t\taction and to bring one in the law-courts for this right belongs also\n\t\t\t\t\tto the parties under a commercial treaty, as they too can sue and be sued at\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw,or rather, in many places even the right of legal action is not\n\t\t\t\t\tshared completely by resident aliens, but they are obliged to produce a patron,\n\t\t\t\t\tso that they only share in a common legal procedure to an incomplete\n\t\t\t\t\tdegree, but these are only\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens in the manner in which children who are as yet too young to have been\n\t\t\t\t\tenrolled in the list and old men who have been discharged must be pronounced to be citizens in a sense, yet not quite\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely, but with the added qualification of under age\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of the former and superannuated or some other\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar term it makes no difference, the meaning being clear\n\t\t\t\t\tin that of the latter. For we seek to define a citizen in the absolute sense,\n\t\t\t\t\tand one possessing nodisqualification\n\t\t\t\t\tof this nature that requires a correcting term, since similar difficulties may\n\t\t\t\t\talso be raised, and solved, about citizens who have been disfranchised or\n\t\t\t\t\texiled. A citizen pure and simple is defined by nothing else so much as by the\n\t\t\t\t\tright to participate in judicial functions and in office. But some offices of\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment are definitely limited in regard to time, so that some of them are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot allowed to be held twice by the same person at all, or only after certain\n\t\t\t\t\tfixed intervals of time; other officials are without limit of tenure, for\n\t\t\t\t\texample the juryman and the member of the assembly. It might perhaps be said that such persons are not\n\t\t\t\t\tofficials at all, and that the exercise of these functions does not constitute\n\t\t\t\t\tthe holding of office; and yet it is absurd to deny the title of\n\t\t\t\t\tofficial to those who have the greatest power in the state. But it need not make\n\t\t\t\t\tany difference, as it is only the question of a name, since there is no common\n\t\t\t\t\tname for a juryman and a member of the assembly that is properly applied to\n\t\t\t\t\tboth. For the sake of distinction therefore let us call the combination of the\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo functions office without limitation. Accordingly we\n\t\t\t\t\tlay it down that those are citizens who participate in office in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanner.Such more or less is the definition of\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen that would best fit with all of those to whom the\n\t\t\t\t\tname is applied. But it must not be\n\t\t\t\t\tforgotten that things in the case of which the things to which they are related\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffer in kind, one of them being primary, another one secondary and so on,\n\t\t\t\t\teither do not contain a common nature at all, as being what they are, or barely\n\t\t\t\t\tdo so. Now we see\n\t\t\t\t\tthat constitutions differ from one another in kind, and that some are subsequent\n\t\t\t\t\tand others prior; for erroneous and divergent forms are necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\tsubsequent to correct forms in what sense we employ the terms\n\t\t\t\t\tdivergent of constitutions will appear later.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence the citizen corresponding to each form of constitution will also\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily be different. Therefore the definition of a citizen that we have\n\t\t\t\t\tgiven applies especially to citizenship in a democracy; under other forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment it may hold good, but will not necessarily do so. For in some states there is no body of common\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens, and they do not have the custom of a popular assembly but councils of\n\t\t\t\t\tspecially convened members, and the office of trying law-suits goes by\n\t\t\t\t\tsectionsfor example at  suits for breach of contract are tried by different\n\t\t\t\t\tephors in different cases, while cases of homicide are tried by the ephors and\n\t\t\t\t\tdoubtless other suits by some other magistrate. The same method is not followed at , where certain magistrates judge all the law-suits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut still, our definition of a\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen admits of correction. For under the other forms of constitution a member\n\t\t\t\t\tof the assembly and of a jury-court is not an official\n\t\t\t\t\twithout restriction, but an official defined according to his office; either all\n\t\t\t\t\tof them or some among them are assigned deliberative and judicial duties either\n\t\t\t\t\tin all matters or in certain matters. What constitutes a citizen is therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tclear from these considerations: we now declare that one who has the right to\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipate in deliberative or judicial office is a citizen of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstatein which he has that right,\n\t\t\t\t\tand a state is a collection of such persons sufficiently numerous, speaking\n\t\t\t\t\tbroadly, to secure independence of life.But in practice citizenship\n\t\t\t\t\tis limited to the child of citizens on both sides, not on one side only, that\n\t\t\t\t\tis, the child of a citizen father or of a citizen mother; and other people carry\n\t\t\t\t\tthis requirement further back, for example to the second or the third preceding\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration or further. But given this as a practical and hasty definition, some\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople raise the difficulty, How will that ancestor three or four generations\n\t\t\t\t\tback have been a citizen? Gorgias of Leontini therefore, partly\n\t\t\t\t\tperhaps in genuine perplexity but partly in jest, said that just as the vessels\n\t\t\t\t\tmade by mortar-makers were mortars, so the citizens made by the magistrates were\n\t\t\t\t\tLarisaeans, since some of the magistrates were actually larisa-makers. But it is really a simple\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter; for if they possessed citizenship in the manner stated in our definition\n\t\t\t\t\tof a citizen, they were citizenssince it is clearly impossible to\n\t\t\t\t\tapply the qualification of descent from a citizen father or mother to the\n\t\t\t\t\toriginal colonizers or founders of a city.But perhaps a question\n\t\t\t\t\trather arises about those who were admitted to citizenship when a revolution had\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken place, for instance such a creation of citizens as that carried out\n\t\t\t\t\tat  by Cleisthenes after the\n\t\t\t\t\texpulsion of the tyrants, when he enrolled in his tribes many resident aliens\n\t\t\t\t\twho had been foreigners or slaves. The dispute as to these is not about the fact\n\t\t\t\t\tof their citizenship, but whether they received it wrongly or rightly. Yet even\n\t\t\t\t\tas to this one might raise the further question, whether, if a man\n\t\t\t\t\tis not rightly a citizen, he is a citizen at all, as\n\t\t\t\t\twrongly means the same as not truly.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut we sometimes see officials governing wrongly, as to whom we shall not deny\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they do govern, but shall say that they do not do it rightly, and a citizen\n\t\t\t\t\tis defined by a certain function of government a citizen, as we said,\n\t\t\t\t\tis one who shares in such and such an office; therefore it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tthat even persons wrongly admitted to citizenship are to be pronounced to be\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens, although the question whether they are so rightly or not rightly is\n\t\t\t\t\tconnected with the question that was propounded before. For some\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons raise the question, When is an occurrence the act of the state and when\n\t\t\t\t\tis it not? for example, when the government has been altered from oligarchy or\n\t\t\t\t\ttyranny to democracy. In such circumstances some people claim that the new\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment should not discharge public debts, on the ground that the money was\n\t\t\t\t\tborrowed by the tyrant and not by the state, and should repudiate many other\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar claims also, because some forms of government rest upon force and are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot aimed at the welfare of the community. If therefore some democracies also are governed in that\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner, the acts of the authorities in their case can only be said to be the\n\t\t\t\t\tacts of the state in the same sense as the public acts emanating from an\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy or a tyranny are said to be. Akin to this controversy seems to be the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject, What exactly is the principle on which we ought to pronounce a city to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe the same city as it was before, or not the same but a different city? The\n\t\t\t\t\tmost obvious mode of inquiring into this difficultydeals with place and people: the place and the people may have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen divided, and some may have settled in one place, and some in another. In\n\t\t\t\t\tthis form the question must be considered as easier of solution; for, as\n\t\t\t\t\tcity has several meanings, the inquiry so put is in a way\n\t\t\t\t\tnot difficult.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut it may similarly be asked,\n\t\t\t\t\tSuppose a set of men inhabit the same place, in what circumstances are we to\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider their city to be a single city? Its unity clearly does not depend on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe walls, for it would be possible to throw a single wall round the ; and a case in point perhaps is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t, and any other city that\n\t\t\t\t\thas the circuit of a nation rather than of a city; for it is said that when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t was captured a considerable\n\t\t\t\t\tpart of the city was not aware of it three days later. But the consideration of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis difficulty will be serviceable for another occasion, as the student of\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitics must not ignore the question, What is the most advantageous size for a\n\t\t\t\t\tcity, and should its population be of one race or of several? But are we to pronounce a city, where the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame population inhabit the same place, to be the same city so long as the\n\t\t\t\t\tpopulation are of the same race, in spite of the fact that all the time some are\n\t\t\t\t\tdying and others being born, just as it is our custom to say that a river or a\n\t\t\t\t\tspring is the same river or spring although one stream of water is always being\n\t\t\t\t\tadded to it and another being withdrawn from it, or are we to say that though\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people are the same people for the similar reason of continuity, yet the\n\t\t\t\t\tcity is a different city? For inasmuch as a state is a kind of partnership,\n\t\t\t\t\tand is in fact a partnership of citizens in a government, when the form of the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment has been altered and is different it would appear to follow that the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate is no longer the same state, just as we say that a chorus which on one\n\t\t\t\t\toccasion acts a comedy and on another a tragedy is a different chorus although\n\t\t\t\t\tit is often composed of the same persons, and similarly with any other common whole or composite\n\t\t\t\t\tstructure we say it is different if the form of its structure is\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentfor instance a musical tune consisting of the same notes we\n\t\t\t\t\tcall a different tune if at one time it is played in the Dorian mode and at\n\t\t\t\t\tanother in the Phrygian. Therefore if this is the case, it is clear that we must\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak of a state as being the same state chiefly with regard to its\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution; and it is possible for it to be called by the same or by a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent designation both when its inhabitants are the same and when they are\n\t\t\t\t\tentirely different persons. But whether a state is or is not bound in justice to\n\t\t\t\t\tdischarge its engagements when it has changed to a different constitution, is\n\t\t\t\t\tanother subject.The next thing to consider after what has now been said is the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion whether we are to hold that the goodness of a good man is the same as\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of a good citizen, or not the same. However, if this point really is to\n\t\t\t\t\treceive investigation, we must first ascertain in some general outline what\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutes the excellence of a citizen.Now a citizen we pronounced to be one sort of partner in a\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunity, as is a sailor. And although sailors differ from each other in\n\t\t\t\t\tfunctionone is an oarsman, another helmsman, another look-out man,\n\t\t\t\t\tand another has some other similar special designationand so clearly\n\t\t\t\t\tthe most exact definition of their excellence will be special to each, yet there\n\t\t\t\t\twill also be a common definition of excellence that will apply alike to all of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem; for security in navigation is the business of them all, since each of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsailors aims at that. Similarly\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore with the citizens, although they are dissimilar from one another,\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir business is the security of their community, and this community is the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, so that the goodness of a citizen must necessarily be relative to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe constitution of the state. If therefore there are various forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, it is clear that there cannot be one single goodness which is the\n\t\t\t\t\tperfect goodness of the good citizen; but when we speak of a good man we mean\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he possesses one single goodness, perfect goodness. Hence it is manifestly\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible to be a good citizen without possessing the goodness that constitutes a\n\t\t\t\t\tgood man. Moreover it is also\n\t\t\t\t\tfeasible to pursue the same topic by raising the question in another manner in\n\t\t\t\t\trelation to the best form of constitution. If it is impossible for a state to consist entirely of good men, and if it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary for each person to perform well the work of his position, and to do\n\t\t\t\t\tthis springs from goodness, then because it is impossible for all the citizens\n\t\t\t\t\tto be alike, the goodness of a good citizen would not be one and the same as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe goodness of a good man; for all ought to possess the goodness of the good\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen that is a necessary condition of the state's being the best\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible, but it is impossible that all should possess the goodness of\n\t\t\t\t\ta good man, if it is not necessary that all the citizens in a good state should\n\t\t\t\t\tbe good men. Again, since the state\n\t\t\t\t\tconsists of unlike personsjust as an animal to take this\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance first consists of soul and body, and a soul of reason and\n\t\t\t\t\tappetite, and a household of husband and wife and ownership\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvolves a master and slave, in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner a state consists of all of these persons and also of others of different\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses in addition to these,it necessarily follows that the goodness\n\t\t\t\t\tof all the citizens is not one and the same, just as among dancers the skill of\n\t\t\t\t\ta head dancer is not the same as that of a subordinate leader. It is clear then from these considerations\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the goodness of a good citizen and that of a good man are not the same in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral; but will the goodness of a good citizen of a particular sort be the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame as that of a good man? Now we say that a good ruler is virtuous and wise,\n\t\t\t\t\tand that a citizen taking part in politics must be wise. Also some people say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat even the education of a ruler must be different, as indeed we see that the\n\t\t\t\t\tsons of kings are educated in horsemanship and military exercises, and Euripides\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsays\n\t\t\t\t\timplying that there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tspecial education for a ruler. And\n\t\t\t\t\tif the goodness of a good ruler is the same as the goodness of a good man, yet\n\t\t\t\t\tthe person ruled is also a citizen, so that the goodness of a citizen in general\n\t\t\t\t\twill not be the same as that of a man, although that of a particular citizen\n\t\t\t\t\twill; for goodness as a ruler is not the same as goodness as a citizen, and no\n\t\t\t\t\tdoubt this is the reason why Jason said that when he was not\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrant he went hungry, meaning that he did not know the art of being a private\n\t\t\t\t\tperson. Another point is that we\n\t\t\t\t\tpraise the ability to rule and to be ruled, and it is doubtless held that the\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness of a citizen consists in ability both to rule and to be ruled well. If\n\t\t\t\t\tthen we lay it down that the goodness of the good man is displayed in ruling,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas that of the citizen is shown in both capacities, the two capacities\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot be equally laudable. Since therefore both views are sometimes accepted,\n\t\t\t\t\tand it is thought that the ruler and the subject do not have to learn the same\n\t\t\t\t\tarts but that the citizen must know both arts and share in both capacities, . .\n\t\t\t\t\t. . And it may be discerned\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the following illustration: one form of authority is that of a master;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby this we mean the exercise of\n\t\t\t\t\tauthority in regard to the necessary work of the house, which it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary for the master to know how to execute, but rather how to utilize; the\n\t\t\t\t\tother capacity, I mean the ability actually to serve in these menial tasks, is\n\t\t\t\t\tindeed a slave's quality. But we distinguish several kinds of slave, as their\n\t\t\t\t\temployments are several. One department belongs to the handicraftsmen, who as\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir name implies are the persons that live by their hands, a class\n\t\t\t\t\tthat includes the mechanic artisan. Hence in some states manual laborers were\n\t\t\t\t\tnot admitted to office in old times, before the development of extreme\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy. The tasks of those who\n\t\t\t\t\tare under this form of authority therefore it is not proper for the good man or\n\t\t\t\t\tthe man fit for citizenship or the good citizen to learn, except for his own\n\t\t\t\t\tprivate use occasionally for then it ceases to be a case of the one\n\t\t\t\t\tparty being master and the other slave. But there exists a form of\n\t\t\t\t\tauthority by which a man rules over persons of the same race as himself, and\n\t\t\t\t\tfree men for that is how we describe political authority,\n\t\t\t\t\tand this the ruler should learn by being ruled, just as a man should command\n\t\t\t\t\tcavalry after having served as a trooper, command a regiment after having served\n\t\t\t\t\tin a regiment and been in command of a company and of a platoon. Hence there is\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch truth in the saying that it is impossible to become a good ruler without\n\t\t\t\t\thaving been a subject. And although\n\t\t\t\t\tthe goodness of a ruler and that of a subject are different, the good citizen\n\t\t\t\t\tmust have the knowledge and the ability both to be ruled and to rule, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tmerit of the good citizen consists in having a knowledge of the government of\n\t\t\t\t\tfree men on both sides. And therefore both these virtues are characteristic of a\n\t\t\t\t\tgood man, even if temperance and justice in a ruler are of a different kind from\n\t\t\t\t\ttemperance and justice in a subject; for clearly a good man's virtue, for\n\t\t\t\t\texample his justice, will not be one and the same when he is under government\n\t\t\t\t\tand when he is free, but it will be of different kinds,one fitting him to rule and one to be ruled, just\n\t\t\t\t\tas temperance and courage are different in a man and in a woman for a\n\t\t\t\t\tman would be thought a coward if he were only as brave as a brave woman, and a\n\t\t\t\t\twoman a chatterer if she were only as modest as a good man; since even the\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold functions of a man and of a woman are differenthis business\n\t\t\t\t\tis to get and hers to keep. And practical wisdom alone of the virtues is a virtue\n\t\t\t\t\tpeculiar to a ruler; for the other virtues seem to be necessary alike for both\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects and rulers to possess, but wisdom assuredly is not a subject's virtue,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut only right opinion: the subject corresponds to the man who makes flutes and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ruler to the flute-player who uses them.The\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion whether the goodness of a good man is the same as that of a good\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen or different, and how they are the same and how different, is clear from\n\t\t\t\t\tthese considerations.But one of the difficulties as to what constitutes a\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen is still left. Is it truly the case that a citizen is a person who has\n\t\t\t\t\tthe right to share office in the government, or are the working classes also to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe counted citizens? If these persons also are to be counted who have no share\n\t\t\t\t\tin offices, it is not possible for every citizen to possess the citizen's\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue; for the true citizen is the man capable of governing. If on the other hand no one of the working\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople is a citizen, in what class are the various workers to be ranked? for\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are neither resident aliens nor foreigners. Or shall we say that so far as\n\t\t\t\t\tthat argument goes no inconsistency results? for slaves also are not in one\n\t\t\t\t\tof the classes mentioned, nor are freedmen. For it is true that not all the persons indispensable for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe existence of a state are to be deemed citizens, since even the sons of\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens are not citizens in the same sense as the adults: the latter are\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens in the full sense, the former only by presumptionthey are\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens, but incomplete ones. In ancient times in fact the artisan class in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome states consisted of slaves or aliens, owing to which the great mass of\n\t\t\t\t\tartisans are so even now; and the best-ordered state will not make an artisan a\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen. While if even the artisan is a citizen, then what we said to be the\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen's virtue must not be said to belong to every citizen, nor merely be\n\t\t\t\t\tdefined as the virtue of a free man, but will only belong to those who are\n\t\t\t\t\treleased from menial occupations. Among menial occupations those who render such services to an individual are\n\t\t\t\t\tslaves, and those who do so for the community are artisans and hired laborers.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe state of the case about them will be manifest from what follows when we\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider it a little further, for what has been said when made known\n\t\t\t\t\titself makes it clear. As there are several forms\n\t\t\t\t\tof constitution, it follows that there are several kinds of citizen, and\n\t\t\t\t\tespecially of the citizen in a subject position; hence under one form of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution citizenship will necessarily extend to the artisan and the hired\n\t\t\t\t\tlaborer, while under other forms this is impossible, for instance in any\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution that is of the form entitled aristocratic and in whichthe honors are bestowed according to\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness and to merit, since a person living a life of manual toil or as a hired\n\t\t\t\t\tlaborer cannot practise the pursuits in which goodness is exercised. In oligarchies on the other hand, though it\n\t\t\t\t\tis impossible for a hired laborer to be a citizen since admission to\n\t\t\t\t\toffice of various grades is based on high property-assessments, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible for an artisan; for even the general mass of the craftsmen are rich. At\n\t\t\t\t\t\t there was a law that no\n\t\t\t\t\tone who had not kept out of trade for the last ten years might be admitted to\n\t\t\t\t\toffice. But under many constitutions the law draws recruits even from\n\t\t\t\t\tforeigners; for in some democracies the son of a citizen-mother is a citizen,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the same rule holds good as\n\t\t\t\t\tto base-born sons in many places. Nevertheless, inasmuch as such persons are\n\t\t\t\t\tadopted as citizens owing to a lack of citizens of legitimate birth\n\t\t\t\t\tfor legislation of this kind is resorted to because of\n\t\t\t\t\tunder-population, when a state becomes well off for numbers it\n\t\t\t\t\tgradually divests itself first of the sons of a slave father or mother, then of\n\t\t\t\t\tthose whose mothers only were citizens, and finally only allows citizenship to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe children of citizens on both sides. These facts then show that there are various kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen, and that a citizen in the fullest sense means the man who shares in the\n\t\t\t\t\thonors of the state, as is implied in the verse of Homer:  since a native not admitted to a share in the public honors is like an\n\t\t\t\t\talien domiciled in the land. But in some places this exclusion is disguised, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe purpose of deceiving those who are a part of the population.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe answer therefore to the question, Is the\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness that makes a good man to be deemed the same as that which makes a\n\t\t\t\t\tworthy citizen, or different? is now clear from what has been said in one form\n\t\t\t\t\tof state the good man and the good citizen are the same, but in another they are\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent, and also in the former case it is not every citizen but only the\n\t\t\t\t\tstatesman, the man who controls or is competent to control, singly or with\n\t\t\t\t\tcolleagues, the administration of the commonwealth, that is essentially also a\n\t\t\t\t\tgood man.And since these points have been determined, the next question\n\t\t\t\t\tto be considered is whether we are to lay it down that there is only one form of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution or several, and if several, what they are and how many and what are\n\t\t\t\t\tthe differences between them. Now a constitution is the ordering of a state in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect of its various magistracies, and especially the magistracy that is\n\t\t\t\t\tsupreme over all matters. For the government is everywhere supreme over the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate and the constitution is the government. I mean that in democratic states\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example the people are supreme, but in oligarchies on the contrary the few\n\t\t\t\t\tare; and we say that they have a different constitution. And we shall use the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame language about the other forms of government also.We have therefore to\n\t\t\t\t\tdetermine first the fundamental points, what is the object for which a state\n\t\t\t\t\texists and how many different kinds of system there are for governing mankind\n\t\t\t\t\tand for controlling the common life.Now it has\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen said in our first discourses, in which we determined the principles concerning household\n\t\t\t\t\tmanagement and the control of slaves, that man is by nature a political\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanimal;and so even when men have\n\t\t\t\t\tno need of assistance from each other they none the less desire to live\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether. At the same time they are\n\t\t\t\t\talso brought together by common interest, so far as each achieves a share of the\n\t\t\t\t\tgood life. The good life then is the chief aim of society, both collectively for\n\t\t\t\t\tall its members and individually; but they also come together and maintain the\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical partnership for the sake of life merely, for doubtless there is some\n\t\t\t\t\telement of value contained even in the mere state of being alive, provided that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is not too great an excess on the side of the hardships of life, and it is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear that the mass of mankind cling to life at the cost of enduring much\n\t\t\t\t\tsuffering, which shows that life contains some measure of well-being and of\n\t\t\t\t\tsweetness in its essential nature.And again, the several recognized varieties\n\t\t\t\t\tof government can easily be defined; in fact we frequently discuss them in our\n\t\t\t\t\texternal discourses. The authority of a\n\t\t\t\t\tmaster over a slave, although in truth when both master and slave are designed\n\t\t\t\t\tby nature for their positions their interests are the same, nevertheless governs\n\t\t\t\t\tin the greater degree with a view to the interest of the master, but\n\t\t\t\t\tincidentally with a view to that of the slave, for if the slave deteriorates the\n\t\t\t\t\tposition of the master cannot be saved from injury. Authority over children and wife and over the\n\t\t\t\t\twhole household, which we call the art of household management is exercised either\n\t\t\t\t\tin the interest of those ruled or for some common interest of both\n\t\t\t\t\tparties,essentially, in the interest of the ruled, as we see that the\n\t\t\t\t\tother arts also, like medicine and athletic training, are pursued in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe interest of the persons upon whom they are practised, although incidentally\n\t\t\t\t\tthey may also be in the interest of the practitioners themselves; for nothing\n\t\t\t\t\tprevents the trainer from being on occasions himself also one of the persons in\n\t\t\t\t\ttraining, just as the pilot is always a member of the crew; so although the\n\t\t\t\t\ttrainer or pilot studies the good of those under his authority, when he himself\n\t\t\t\t\talso becomes one among them he incidentally shares the benefit, for the pilot is\n\t\t\t\t\ta sailor in the ship and the trainer can become one of the persons in training\n\t\t\t\t\tunder his own direction. Hence in\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to the political offices also, when the state is constituted on the\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple of equality and of similarity between the citizens, these claim to\n\t\t\t\t\thold office by turnin earlier times, under the natural system,\n\t\t\t\t\tclaiming to do public services in turn, and for somebody in return to look after\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir own welfare just as previously they looked after his interest when in\n\t\t\t\t\toffice themselves; but nowadays owing to the benefits to be got from public\n\t\t\t\t\tsources and from holding office people wish to be in office continuously, just\n\t\t\t\t\tas if it were the case that those in office although sickly people always\n\t\t\t\t\tenjoyed good healthin which case office would no doubt be much run\n\t\t\t\t\tafter by invalids.It is clear then that those constitutions that aim at the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon advantage are in effect rightly framed in accordance with absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice, while those that aim at the rulers' own advantage only are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaulty,and are all of them\n\t\t\t\t\tdeviations from the right constitutions; for they have an element of despotism,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas a city is a partnership of free men.These\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters having been determined the next step is to consider how many forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution there are and what they are; and first to study the right forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, since the deviations will also become manifest when these are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefined.But inasmuch as constitution means the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame as government, and the government is the supreme\n\t\t\t\t\tpower in the state, and this must be either a single ruler or a few or the mass\n\t\t\t\t\tof the citizens, in cases when the one or the few or the many govern with an eye\n\t\t\t\t\tto the common interest, these constitutions must necessarily be right ones,\n\t\t\t\t\twhile those administered with an eye to the private interest of either the one\n\t\t\t\t\tor the few or the multitude are deviations. For either we must not say that\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who are part of the state are citizens, or those who are part of the state\n\t\t\t\t\tmust share in the advantage of membership. Our customary designation for a monarchy that aims at the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon advantage is kingship; for a government of more\n\t\t\t\t\tthan one yet only a few aristocracy either\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the best men rule or because they rule with a view to what is best for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe state and for its members; while when the multitude govern the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate with a view to the common advantage, it is called by the name common to\n\t\t\t\t\tall the forms of constitution, constitutional government.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd this comes about\n\t\t\t\t\treasonably, since although it is possible for one man or a few to excel in\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue, when the number is larger it becomes difficult for them to possess\n\t\t\t\t\tperfect excellence in respect of every form of virtue, but they can best\n\t\t\t\t\texcel in military valor, for this is found with numbers; and therefore with this\n\t\t\t\t\tform of constitution the class that fights for the state in war is the most\n\t\t\t\t\tpowerful, and it is those who possess arms who are admitted to the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment. Deviations\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the constitutions mentioned are tyranny corresponding to kingship,\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy to aristocracy, and democracy to constitutional government; for\n\t\t\t\t\ttyranny is monarchy ruling in the interest of the monarch, oligarchy government\n\t\t\t\t\tin the interest of the rich, democracy government in the interest of the poor,\n\t\t\t\t\tand none of these forms governs with regard to the profit of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommunity.But it is necessary to say at a\n\t\t\t\t\tlittle greater length what each of these constitutions is; for the question\n\t\t\t\t\tinvolves certain difficulties, and it is the special mark of one who studies any\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject philosophically, and not solely with regard to its practical aspect,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he does not overlook or omit any point, but brings to light the truth about\n\t\t\t\t\teach. Now tyranny, as has been said,\n\t\t\t\t\tis monarchy exerting despotic power over the political community; oligarchy is\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the control of the government is in the hands of those that own the\n\t\t\t\t\tproperties; democracy is when on the contrary it is in the hands of those that\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not possess much property, but are poor.A first difficulty is with regard to the definition. If the\n\t\t\t\t\tmajority of the citizens were wealthy and were in control of the state, yet when\n\t\t\t\t\tthe multitude is in power it is a democracy, and similarly, to take the other\n\t\t\t\t\tcase, if it were to occur somewhere that the poor were fewer than the rich but\n\t\t\t\t\twere stronger than they and accordingly were in control of the government, yet\n\t\t\t\t\twhere a small number is in control it is said to be an oligarchy, then it would\n\t\t\t\t\tseem that our definition of the forms of constitution was not a good one.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd once again, if one assumed the\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination of small numbers with wealth and of multitude with poverty, and\n\t\t\t\t\tnamed the constitutions thusone in which the rich being few in number\n\t\t\t\t\thold the offices, oligarchy: one in which the poor being many in number hold the\n\t\t\t\t\toffices, democracy,this involves another difficulty. What names are\n\t\t\t\t\twe to give to the constitutions just describedthe one in which there\n\t\t\t\t\tare more rich and the one in which the poor are the fewer, and these control\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir respective governmentsif there exists no other form of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution beside those mentioned? The argument therefore seems to make it clear that for few or many to have\n\t\t\t\t\tpower is an accidental feature of oligarchies in the one case and democracies in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other, due to the fact that the rich are few and the poor are many\n\t\t\t\t\teverywhere so that it is not really the case that the points mentioned\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitute a specific difference, but that the real thing in which\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy and oligarchy differ from each other is poverty and wealth; and it\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily follows that wherever the rulers owe their power to wealth, whether\n\t\t\t\t\tthey be a minority or a majority, this is an oligarchy, and when the poor rule,\n\t\t\t\t\tit is a democracy, although it does accidentally happen, as we said, that where\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rulers hold power by wealth they are few and where they hold power by\n\t\t\t\t\tpoverty they are many, because few men are rich but all men possess freedom, and\n\t\t\t\t\twealth and freedom are the grounds on which the two classes lay claim to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment.And first we must ascertain what are stated to be the\n\t\t\t\t\tdetermining qualities of oligarchy and democracy, and what is the principle of\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice under the one form of government and under the other. For all men lay\n\t\t\t\t\thold on justice of some sort, but they only advance to a certain point, and do\n\t\t\t\t\tnot express the principle of absolute justice in its entirety. For instance, it\n\t\t\t\t\tis thought that justice is equality, and so it is, though not for everybody but\n\t\t\t\t\tonly for those who are equals; and it is thought that inequality is just, for so\n\t\t\t\t\tindeed it is, though not for everybody, but for those who are unequal; but these\n\t\t\t\t\tpartisans strip away the qualification of the persons concerned, and judge\n\t\t\t\t\tbadly. And the cause of this is that they are themselves concerned in the\n\t\t\t\t\tdecision, and perhaps most men are bad judges when their own interests are in\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion. Hence inasmuch as\n\t\t\t\t\tjust means just for certain persons, and it is divided in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same way in relation to the things to be distributed and the persons that\n\t\t\t\t\treceive them, as has been said before in the Ethics, the two parties agree as to what constitutes\n\t\t\t\t\tequality in the thing, but dispute as to what constitutes equality in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperson,chiefly for the reason\n\t\t\t\t\tjust now stated, because men are bad judges where they themselves are concerned,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut also, inasmuch as both parties put forward a plea that is just up to a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain point, they think that what they say is absolutely just. For the one\n\t\t\t\t\tside think that if they are unequal in some respects, for instance in wealth,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are entirely unequal, and the other side think that if they are equal in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome respects, for instance in freedom, they are entirely equal. But the most important thing they do not\n\t\t\t\t\tmention. If men formed the community and came together for the sake of wealth,\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir share in the state is proportionate to their share in the property, so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the argument of the champions of oligarchy would appear to be\n\t\t\t\t\tvalidnamely that in a partnership with a capital of 100 minae it would not be just\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the man who contributed one mina to have a share whether of the principal or\n\t\t\t\t\tof the profits accruing equal to the share of the man who supplied the whole of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe remainder; but if on the other hand the state was formed not for the sake of\n\t\t\t\t\tlife only but rather for the good life for otherwise a collection of\n\t\t\t\t\tslaves or of lower animals would be a state, but as it is, it is not a state,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause slaves and animals have no share in well-being\n\t\t\t\t\tor in purposive life, and if its object is not military alliance for\n\t\t\t\t\tdefence against injury by anybody, and it does not exist for the sake of trade\n\t\t\t\t\tand of business relationsfor if so, Etruscans and Carthaginians and all the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople that have commercial relations with one another would be virtually\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens of a single state; at all\n\t\t\t\t\tevents they have agreements about imports and covenants as to abstaining from\n\t\t\t\t\tdishonesty and treaties of alliance for mutual defence; but they do not\n\t\t\t\t\thave officials common to them all appointed to enforce these covenants, but\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent officials with either party, nor yet does either party take any\n\t\t\t\t\tconcern as to the proper moral character of the other, nor attempt to secure\n\t\t\t\t\tthat nobody in the states under the covenant shall be dishonest or in any way\n\t\t\t\t\timmoral, but only that they shall not commit any wrong against each other. All\n\t\t\t\t\tthose on the other hand who are concerned about good government do take civic\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue and vice into their purview. Thus it is also clear that any state that is\n\t\t\t\t\ttruly so called and is not a state merely in name must pay attention to virtue;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor otherwise the community becomes merely an alliance, differing only in\n\t\t\t\t\tlocality from the other alliances, those of allies that live apart. And the law\n\t\t\t\t\tis a covenant or, in the phrase of the sophist Lycophron, a\n\t\t\t\t\tguarantee of men's just claims on one another, but it is not designed to make\n\t\t\t\t\tthe citizens virtuous and just. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthat this is how the matter stands is manifest. For if one were actually to\n\t\t\t\t\tbring the sites of two cities together into one, so that the city-walls of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t and those of  were contiguous, even so they\n\t\t\t\t\twould not be one city; nor would they if they enacted rights of intermarriage\n\t\t\t\t\twith each other, although intermarriage between citizens is one of the elements\n\t\t\t\t\tof community which are characteristic of states. And similarly even if certain\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople lived in separate places yet not so far apart as not to have intercourse,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut had laws to prevent their wronging one anotherin their interchange of products for instance, if\n\t\t\t\t\tone man were a carpenter, another a farmer, another a shoemaker and another\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else of the kind,and the whole population numbered ten\n\t\t\t\t\tthousand, but nevertheless they had no mutual dealings in anything else except\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch things as exchange of commodities and military alliance, even then this\n\t\t\t\t\twould still not be a state. What\n\t\t\t\t\tthen exactly is the reason for this? for clearly it is not because their\n\t\t\t\t\tintercourse is from a distance since even if they came together for intercourse\n\t\t\t\t\tof this sort each nevertheless using his individual house as a\n\t\t\t\t\tcity and for one another's military aid against wrongful aggressors\n\t\t\t\t\tonly, as under a defensive alliance, not even then would they seem to those who\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider the matter carefully to constitute a state, if they associated on the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame footing when they came together as they did when they were apart. It is\n\t\t\t\t\tmanifest therefore that a state is not merely the sharing of a common locality\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the purpose of preventing mutual injury and exchanging goods. These are\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary preconditions of a state's existence, yet nevertheless, even if all\n\t\t\t\t\tthese conditions are present, that does not therefore make a state, but a state\n\t\t\t\t\tis a partnership of families and of clans in living well, and its object is a\n\t\t\t\t\tfull and independent life. At the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame time this will not be realized unless the partners do inhabit one and the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame locality and practise intermarriage; this indeed is the reason why family\n\t\t\t\t\trelationships have arisen throughout the states, and brotherhoods and clubs for\n\t\t\t\t\tsacrificial rites and social recreations. But such organization is produced by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe feeling of friendship, for friendship is the motive of social life;\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, while the object of a state is the good life, these things are means\n\t\t\t\t\tto that end. And a state is the partnership of clans and villages in a full and\n\t\t\t\t\tindependent life, which in our view constitutes a happy and noble\n\t\t\t\t\tlife; the political fellowship must therefore be deemed to exist for the sake of\n\t\t\t\t\tnoble actions, not merely for living in common. Hence those who contribute most to such fellowship have a\n\t\t\t\t\tlarger part in the state than those who are their equals or superiors in freedom\n\t\t\t\t\tand birth but not their equals in civic virtue, or than those who surpass them\n\t\t\t\t\tin wealth but are surpassed by them in virtue.It\n\t\t\t\t\tis therefore clear from what has been said that all those who dispute about the\n\t\t\t\t\tforms of constitution assert a part of the just principle.But it is a matter\n\t\t\t\t\tof question what ought to be the sovereign power in the state. Clearly it must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe either the multitude, or the rich, or the good, or the one man who is best of\n\t\t\t\t\tall, or a tyrant. But all of these arrangements appear to involve disagreeable\n\t\t\t\t\tconsequences. For instance, if the poor take advantage of their greater numbers\n\t\t\t\t\tto divide up the property of the rich, is not this unjust? No, it may be said,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor it was a resolution made by the supreme authority in just form. Then what\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be pronounced to be the extreme of injustice? And again, when everybody is\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken into account, suppose the majority share out among themselves the property\n\t\t\t\t\tof the minority, it is manifest that they are destroying the state; but\n\t\t\t\t\tassuredly virtue does not destroyits\n\t\t\t\t\tpossessor, and justice is not destructive of the state, so that it is clear that\n\t\t\t\t\tthis principle also cannot be just. Also it follows from it that all the actions done by a tyrant are just, for\n\t\t\t\t\this use of force is based upon superior strength, as is the compulsion exerted\n\t\t\t\t\tby the multitude against the rich. But is it just that the minority and the rich\n\t\t\t\t\tshould rule? Suppose therefore they also act in the same way and plunder and\n\t\t\t\t\ttake away the property of the multitude, is this just? If it is, so also is the\n\t\t\t\t\tplunder of the rich by the multitude. It is clear therefore that all these\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are bad and not just. But\n\t\t\t\t\tought the good to rule, and be in control of all classes? If so, then it follows\n\t\t\t\t\tthat all the other classes will be dishonored, if they are not honored by holding the offices of\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment; for we speak of offices as honors, and if the same persons are\n\t\t\t\t\talways in office the rest must necessarily be excluded from honor. But is it\n\t\t\t\t\tbetter for the most virtuous individual to be the ruler? But that is still more\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchical, for the people excluded from honor will be more numerous. But\n\t\t\t\t\tperhaps some one would say that in any case it is a bad thing for a human being,\n\t\t\t\t\thaving in his soul the passions that are the attributes of humanity, to be\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereign, and not the law. Suppose therefore that law is sovereign, but law of\n\t\t\t\t\tan oligarchic or democratic nature, what difference will it make as regards the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties that have been raised? for the results described before will come\n\t\t\t\t\tabout just the same.Most of these points therefore must be discussed on\n\t\t\t\t\tanother occasion; but the view that it is more proper for the multitude to be\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereign than the few of greatest virtue might be thought to be explicable and\n\t\t\t\t\tto have some justification, and even to be the true view. For it is possible\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the many, though not individually good men, yet when they come\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether may be better, not individually but collectively, than those who are\n\t\t\t\t\tso, just as public dinners to which many contribute are better than those\n\t\t\t\t\tsupplied at one man's cost; for where there are many, each individual, it may be\n\t\t\t\t\targued, has some portion of virtue and wisdom, and when they have come together,\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as the multitude becomes a single man with many feet and many hands and\n\t\t\t\t\tmany senses, so also it becomes one personality as regards the moral and\n\t\t\t\t\tintellectual faculties. This is why the general public is a better judge of the\n\t\t\t\t\tworks of music and those of the poets, because different men can judge a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent part of the performance, and all of them all of it. But the superiority of good men over the mass of\n\t\t\t\t\tmen individually, like that of handsome men, so it is said, over plain men and\n\t\t\t\t\tof the works of the painter's art over the real objects, really consists in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis, that a number of scattered good points have been collected together into\n\t\t\t\t\tone example; since if the features be taken separately, the eye of one real\n\t\t\t\t\tperson is more beautiful than that of the man in the picture, and some other\n\t\t\t\t\tfeature of somebody else. It is not indeed clear whether this collective\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperiority of the many compared with the few good men can possibly exist in\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to every democracy and every multitude, and perhaps it may be urged that\n\t\t\t\t\tit is manifestly impossible in the case of somefor the same argument\n\t\t\t\t\twould also apply to animals, yet what difference is there,practically, between some multitudes and\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals?but nothing prevents what has been said from being true about\n\t\t\t\t\tsome particular multitude. One might\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore employ these considerations to solve not only the previously stated\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty but also the related question, over what matters is the authority of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe freemen, the mass of the citizens, to extend using that expression\n\t\t\t\t\tto denote those who are not rich nor possessed of any distinguishing excellence\n\t\t\t\t\tat all? For it is not safe for them to participate in the highest\n\t\t\t\t\toffices for injustice and folly would inevitably cause them to act\n\t\t\t\t\tunjustly in some things and to make mistakes in others, but yet not to\n\t\t\t\t\tadmit them and for them not to participate is an alarming situation, for when\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are a number of persons without political honors and in poverty, the city\n\t\t\t\t\tthen is bound to be full of enemies. It remains therefore for them to share the\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberative and judicial functions. For this reason Solon and certain other lawgivers appoint the common citizens\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the\n\t\t\t\t\telection of the magistrates and the function of calling them to audit, although\n\t\t\t\t\tthey do not allow them to hold office singly. For all when assembled together\n\t\t\t\t\thave sufficient discernment, and by mingling with the better class are of\n\t\t\t\t\tbenefit to the state, just as impure food mixed with what is pure makes the\n\t\t\t\t\twhole more nourishing than the small amount of pure food alone; but separately\n\t\t\t\t\tthe individual is immature in judgement. This arrangement of the constitution is however open to\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion in the first place on the ground that it might be held that the best\n\t\t\t\t\tman to judge which physician has given the right treatment is the man that is\n\t\t\t\t\thimself capable of treating and curing the patient of his present disease, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is the man who is himself a physician; and that this is the case\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly with regard to the other arts and crafts. Hence just as a court of\n\t\t\t\t\tphysicians must judge the work of a physician, so also all other practitioners\n\t\t\t\t\tought to be called to account before their fellows. But\n\t\t\t\t\tphysician means both the ordinary practitioner, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tmaster of the craft, and thirdly, the man who has studied medicine as part of\n\t\t\t\t\this general education for in almost all the arts there are some such\n\t\t\t\t\tstudents, and we assign the right of judgement just as much to cultivated\n\t\t\t\t\tamateurs as to experts. Further the same might be thought to hold good also of the election of\n\t\t\t\t\tofficials, for to elect rightly is a task for expertsfor example, it\n\t\t\t\t\tis for experts in the science of mensuration to elect a land-surveyor and for\n\t\t\t\t\texperts in navigation to choose a pilot; for even though in some occupations and\n\t\t\t\t\tarts some laymen also have a voice in appointments, yet they certainly do not\n\t\t\t\t\thave more voice than the experts. Hence according to this argument the masses\n\t\t\t\t\tshould not be put in control over either the election of magistrates or their\n\t\t\t\t\taudit. But perhaps this statement\n\t\t\t\t\tis not entirely correct, both for the reason stated above, in case the populace is not of too slavish a\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter for although each individual separately will be a worse\n\t\t\t\t\tjudge than the experts, the whole of them assembled together will be better or\n\t\t\t\t\tat least as good judges, and also because about some things the man\n\t\t\t\t\twho made them would not be the only nor the best judge, in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tprofessionals whose products come within the knowledge of laymen also:to judge a house, for instance, does not\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong only to the man who built it, but in fact the man who uses the house\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is, the householder will be an even better judge of it,\n\t\t\t\t\tand a steersman judges a rudder better than a carpenter, and the diner judges a\n\t\t\t\t\tbanquet better than the cook.This difficulty then\n\t\t\t\t\tmight perhaps be thought to be satisfactorily solved in this way. But there is another connected with it: it\n\t\t\t\t\tis thought to be absurd that the base should be in control over more important\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters than the respectable; but the audits and the elections of magistrates\n\t\t\t\t\tare a very important matter, yet in some constitutions, as has been said, they\n\t\t\t\t\tare assigned to the common people, for all such matters are under the control of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe assembly, yet persons of a low property-assessment and of any age take part\n\t\t\t\t\tin the assembly and the council and sit on juries, whereas treasury officials,\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerals and the holders of the highest magistracies are drawn from among\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons of large property. Now this\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty also may be solved in a similar way; for perhaps these regulations\n\t\t\t\t\talso are sound, since it is not the individual juryman or councillor or member\n\t\t\t\t\tof the assembly in whom authority rests, but the court, the council and the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople, while each of the individuals named I mean the councillor, the\n\t\t\t\t\tmembers of assembly and the juryman is a part of those bodies. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tjustly the multitude is sovereign in greater matters, for the popular assembly,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe council and the jury-court are formed of a number of people, and also the\n\t\t\t\t\tassessed property of all these members collectively is more than that of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates holding great offices individually or in small groups.Let these\n\t\t\t\t\tpoints therefore be decided in this manner. But the difficulty first\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmentioned\n\t\t\t\t\tproves nothing else so clearly as that it is proper for the laws when rightly\n\t\t\t\t\tlaid down to be sovereign, while the ruler or rulers in office should have\n\t\t\t\t\tsupreme powers over matters as to which the laws are quite unable to pronounce\n\t\t\t\t\twith precision because of the difficulty of making a general rule to cover all\n\t\t\t\t\tcases. We have not however yet ascertained at all what particular character a\n\t\t\t\t\tcode of laws correctly laid down ought to possess, but the difficulty raised at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe start still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremains; for necessarily the laws are\n\t\t\t\t\tgood or bad, just or unjust, simultaneously with and similarly to the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions of states though of course it is obvious that the laws\n\t\t\t\t\tare bound to be adapted to the constitution; yet if so, it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the laws in conformity with the right constitutions must necessarily be\n\t\t\t\t\tjust and those in conformity with the divergent forms of constitution\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunjust.And\n\t\t\t\t\tinasmuch as in all the sciences and arts the End is a good, and the greatest\n\t\t\t\t\tgood and good in the highest degree in the most authoritative of all, which is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe political faculty, and the good in the political field, that is, the general\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantage, is justice, it is therefore thought by all men that justice is some\n\t\t\t\t\tsort of equality, and up to a certain point at all events they agree with the\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophical discourses in whichconclusions have been reached about questions of ethics; for justice is a quality of a thing in relation\n\t\t\t\t\tto persons, and they hold that for persons that are\n\t\t\t\t\tequal the thing must be equal. But equality in what characteristics does this\n\t\t\t\t\tmean, and inequality in what? This must be made clear, since this too raises a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty, and calls for political philosophy. For perhaps someone might say that the offices of state\n\t\t\t\t\tought to be distributed unequally according to superiority in every good\n\t\t\t\t\tquality, even if the candidates in all other respects did not differ at all but\n\t\t\t\t\twere exactly alike, because men that are different have different\n\t\t\t\t\trights and merits. Yet if this is true, those who are superior in complexion or\n\t\t\t\t\tstature or any good quality will have an advantage in respect of political\n\t\t\t\t\trights. But surely the error here is obvious, and it comes out clearly if we\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider the other sciences and faculties. Among flute-players equally good at\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir art it is not proper to give an advantage in respect of the flutes to\n\t\t\t\t\tthose of better birth, for they will not play any better, but it is the superior\n\t\t\t\t\tperformers who ought to be given the superior instruments. And if our meaning is not yet plain, it will become\n\t\t\t\t\tstill clearer when we have carried the matter further. Suppose someone is\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperior in playing the flute but much inferior in birth or in good looks, then,\n\t\t\t\t\teven granting that each of these thingsbirth and beautyis\n\t\t\t\t\ta greater good than ability to play the flute, and even though they surpass\n\t\t\t\t\tflute-playing proportionately more than the best flute-player surpasses the\n\t\t\t\t\tothers in flute-playing, even so the best flute-player ought to be given the\n\t\t\t\t\toutstandingly good flutes; for otherwise superiority both in wealth and in\n\t\t\t\t\tbirth ought to contribute to the excellence of the performance, but they do not\n\t\t\t\t\tdo so at all. Moreover on this\n\t\t\t\t\ttheory every good thing would be commensurable with every other. For if to be of\n\t\t\t\t\tsome particular height gave more claim, then height in general would be in\n\t\t\t\t\tcompetition with wealth and with free birth; therefore if A excels in height\n\t\t\t\t\tmore than B does in virtue, and speaking generally size gives more superiority\n\t\t\t\t\tthan virtue, all things would be commensurable\n\t\t\t\t\tfor; if such-and-such an amount of one thing is better than such-and-such an\n\t\t\t\t\tamount of another, it is clear that such-and-such an amount of the one is equal\n\t\t\t\t\tto that amount of another. But since\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is impossible, it is clear that in politics with good reason men do not\n\t\t\t\t\tclaim a right to office on the ground of inequality of every kindif\n\t\t\t\t\tone set of men are slow runners and another fast, this is no good ground for the\n\t\t\t\t\tone set having more and the other less political\n\t\t\t\t\tpower, but the latter's superiority receives its honor in athletic contests; but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe claim to office must necessarily be based on superiority in those things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich go to the making of the state. Hence it is reasonable for the well-born,\n\t\t\t\t\tfree and wealthy to lay claim to honor; for there must be free men and\n\t\t\t\t\ttax-payers, since a state consisting entirely of poor men would not be a state,\n\t\t\t\t\tany more than one consisting of slaves. But then, granting there is need of these, it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthatthere is also need of justice\n\t\t\t\t\tand civic virtue, for these are also indispensable in the administration of a\n\t\t\t\t\tstate; except that wealth and freedom are indispensable for a state's existence,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas justice and civic virtue are indispensable for its good\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadministration.As a means therefore towards a\n\t\t\t\t\tstate's existence all or at all events some of these factors would seem to make\n\t\t\t\t\ta good claim, although as means to a good life education and virtue would make\n\t\t\t\t\tthe most just claim, as has been said also before. On the other hand since those who are equal in one thing\n\t\t\t\t\tonly ought not to have equality in all things nor those unequal as regards one\n\t\t\t\t\tthing inequality in all, it follows that all these forms of constitution must be\n\t\t\t\t\tdeviations. Now it has been said before that all make a claim that is in a\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner just, though not all a claim that is absolutely just; the rich claiming\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they have a larger share of the land, and the land is common property,\n\t\t\t\t\tand also as being for the most part more faithful to their covenants; the free\n\t\t\t\t\tand well-born as being closely connected together for the better-born\n\t\t\t\t\tare citizens to a greater degree than those of claims, low birth, and good birth\n\t\t\t\t\tis in every community held in honor at home, and also because it is\n\t\t\t\t\tprobable that the children of better parents will be better, for good birth\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans goodness of breed; and we\n\t\t\t\t\tshall admit that virtue also makes an equally just claim, for we hold that\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice is social virtue, which necessarily brings all the other virtues in its\n\t\t\t\t\ttrain; but moreover the majority have a just claim as compared with the\n\t\t\t\t\tminority, since they are stronger and richer and better if their superior\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers are taken in comparison with the others' inferior numbers. Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tsupposing all were in one city, I mean, that is, the good and the wealthy and\n\t\t\t\t\tnoble and also an additional mass of citizens, will there be a dispute, or will\n\t\t\t\t\tthere not, as to who ought to govern? It is true that under each of the forms of constitution that have been\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned the decision as to who ought to govern is undisputed for the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference between them lies in their sovereign classesone is\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinguished by being governed by the rich men, one by being governed by the\n\t\t\t\t\tgood men, and similarly each of the others; but nevertheless we are\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidering the question how we are to decide between these classes supposing\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they all exist in the state at the same period.If then the possessors of\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue should be quite few in number, how is the decision to be made? ought we\n\t\t\t\t\tto consider their fewness in relation to the task, and whether they are able to\n\t\t\t\t\tadminister the state, or sufficiently numerous to constitute a state? And there\n\t\t\t\t\tis some difficulty as regards all the rival claimants to political honors. Those\n\t\t\t\t\twho claim to rule because of their wealth might seem to have no justice in their\n\t\t\t\t\tproposal, and similarly also those who claim on the score of birth; for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear that if, to go a step further, a single individual is richer than all the\n\t\t\t\t\tothers together, according to the same principle of justice it will obviously be\n\t\t\t\t\tright for this one man to rule over all, and similarly the man of outstanding\n\t\t\t\t\tnobility among the claimantson the\n\t\t\t\t\tscore of free birth. And this same\n\t\t\t\t\tthing will perhaps result in the case of aristocratic government based on\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue; for if there be some one man who is better than the other virtuous men\n\t\t\t\t\tin the state, by the same principle of justice that man must be sovereign.\n\t\t\t\t\tAccordingly if it is actually proper for the multitude to be sovereign because\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are better than the few, then also, if one person or if more than one but\n\t\t\t\t\tfewer than the many are better than the rest, it would be proper for these\n\t\t\t\t\trather than the multitude to be sovereign. All these considerations therefore seem to prove the\n\t\t\t\t\tincorrectness of all of the standards on which men claim that they themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tshall govern and everybody else be governed by them. For surely even against\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who claim to be sovereign over the government on account of virtue, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly against those who claim on account of wealth, the multitudes might be\n\t\t\t\t\table to advance a just plea; for it is quite possible that at some time the\n\t\t\t\t\tmultitude may be collectively better and richer than the few, although not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindividually.Hence it is also possible to meet in this way the question\n\t\t\t\t\twhich some persons investigate and put forward for some raise the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion whether the legislator desiring to lay down the rightest laws should\n\t\t\t\t\tlegislate with a view to the advantage of the better people or that of the\n\t\t\t\t\tlarger number in cases when the situation mentioned\n\t\t\t\t\toccurs. And right must be taken in the sense of\n\t\t\t\t\tequally right, and this means right in regard to the\n\t\t\t\t\tinterest of the whole state and in regard to the common welfare of the citizens;\n\t\t\t\t\tand a citizen is in general one who shares in governing and being governed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough he is different according to each form of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, but in relation to the best form a citizen is one who has the\n\t\t\t\t\tcapacity and the will to be governed and to govern with a view to the life in\n\t\t\t\t\taccordance with virtue.But if there is any one man so greatly distinguished in\n\t\t\t\t\toutstanding virtue, or more than one but not enough to be able to make up a\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete state, so that the virtue of all the rest and their political ability\n\t\t\t\t\tis not comparable with that of the men mentioned, if they are several, or if\n\t\t\t\t\tone, with his alone, it is no longer proper to count these exceptional men a\n\t\t\t\t\tpart of the state; for they will be treated unjustly if deemed worthy of equal\n\t\t\t\t\tstatus, being so widely unequal in virtue and in their political ability: since\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch a man will naturally be as a god among men. Hence it is clear that legislation also must necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\tbe concerned with persons who are equal in birth and in ability, but there can\n\t\t\t\t\tbe no law dealing with such men as those described, for they are themselves a\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw; indeed a man would be ridiculous if he tried to legislate for them, for\n\t\t\t\t\tprobably they would say what in the story of Antisthenes the lions said when the hares\n\t\t\t\t\tmade speeches in the assembly and demanded that all should have equality. This\n\t\t\t\t\tis why democratically governed states institute the system of ostracism, because\n\t\t\t\t\tof a reason of this nature; for these are the states considered to pursue\n\t\t\t\t\tequality most of all things,so that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey used to ostracize men thought to be outstandingly powerful on account of\n\t\t\t\t\twealth or popularity or some other form of political strength, and used to\n\t\t\t\t\tbanish them out of the city for fixed periods of time. And there is a mythical story that the Argonauts left\n\t\t\t\t\tHeracles behind for a similar reason; for the \n\t\t\t\t\tArgo refused to carry him with the\n\t\t\t\t\tothers because he was so much heavier than the sailors. Hence also those who\n\t\t\t\t\tblame tyranny and Periander's advice to Thrasybulus must not\n\t\t\t\t\tbe thought to be absolutely right in their censure the story is that\n\t\t\t\t\tPeriander made no reply to the herald sent to ask his advice, but levelled the\n\t\t\t\t\tcorn-field by plucking off the ears that stood out above the rest; and\n\t\t\t\t\tconsequently, although the herald did not know the reason for what was going on,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen he carried back news of what had occurred, Thrasybulus understood that he\n\t\t\t\t\twas to destroy the outstanding citizens; for this policy is advantageous not only for tyrants, nor\n\t\t\t\t\tis it only tyrants that use it, but the same is the case with oligarchies and\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracies as well; for ostracism has in a way the same effect as docking off\n\t\t\t\t\tthe outstanding men by exile. And the same course is adopted in regard to cities\n\t\t\t\t\tand races by the holders of sovereign power, for example the Athenians so dealt\n\t\t\t\t\twith the Samians and Chians and Lesbians\n\t\t\t\t\tfor no sooner did they get a strong hold of their empire than they\n\t\t\t\t\thumbled them in contravention of their covenants, and the king of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Persians frequently used to cut down the numbers of the Medes and\n\t\t\t\t\tBabylonians and the other races that had waxed proud because they had once been\n\t\t\t\t\thead of an empire. And the problem\n\t\t\t\t\tapplies universally to all the forms of constitution, even the right forms; for\n\t\t\t\t\twhile the divergent forms of government do this because their regard is fixed on\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir private advantage, nevertheless with the constitutions directed to the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon good the same is the case. And this is also clear in the field of the\n\t\t\t\t\tother arts and sciences; a painter would not let his animal have its foot of\n\t\t\t\t\tdisproportionately large size, even though it was an exceptionally beautiful\n\t\t\t\t\tfoot, nor would a shipbuilder make the stern or some other part of a ship\n\t\t\t\t\tdisproportionately big, nor yet will a trainer of choruses allow a man who sings\n\t\t\t\t\tlouder and more beautifully than the whole band to be a member of it. Hence as far as this practice goes nothing\n\t\t\t\t\tprevents monarchs from being in harmony with the cities they rule, if they\n\t\t\t\t\tresort to it when their own personal rule is beneficial to the cities. Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tin relation to acknowledged superiorities the argument for ostracism has a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain element of political justice. True, it is better for the lawgiver so to\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitute the state at the outset that it does not need this medicine; but the\n\t\t\t\t\tnext best course to steer, if occasion arises, is to endeavor to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorrectthe constitution by some\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch method of rectification. But this was not what happened with the states,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor they were not looking at what was advantageous for their proper\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, but their acts of ostracism were done in a revolutionary spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the divergent forms of constitution therefore it is evident that ostracism is\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantageous and just under the special constitution, though perhaps it is also\n\t\t\t\t\tevident that it is not just absolutely; but in the case of the best constitution there is\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch doubt as to what ought to be done, not as regards superiority in the other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings of value, such as strength and wealth and popularity, but in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\ta person becoming exceptionally distinguished for virtue. It certainly would not\n\t\t\t\t\tbe said that such a man must be banished and got out of the way; yet\n\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless no doubt men would not think that they ought to rule over such a\n\t\t\t\t\tman, for that would be the same as if they claimed to rule over Zeus, dividing\n\t\t\t\t\tup his spheres of government. It remains therefore, and this seems to be the\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural course, for all to obey such a man gladly, so that men of this sort may\n\t\t\t\t\tbe kings in the cities for all time.And perhaps it is well after the subjects\n\t\t\t\t\tthat have been discussed to pass over to consider royal government; for we\n\t\t\t\t\tpronounce this to be one of the correct constitutions. And it has to be\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidered whether it is advantageous for a city or a country that is to be well\n\t\t\t\t\tadministered to be ruled by a king, or whether it is not so but some other\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution is more expedient, or whether royal rule is expedient for some\n\t\t\t\t\tstates and not for others. But it is needful to decide first whether there is\n\t\t\t\t\tonly one sort of kingship or whether it has several varieties. Now it is at all events easy to discern that kingship includes several kinds,\n\t\t\t\t\tand that the mode of government is not the same in all. For the kingship in the\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartan constitution, which is held to be a typical royalty of the kind guided\n\t\t\t\t\tby law, does not carry sovereignty in all matters, though when a king goes on a\n\t\t\t\t\tforeign expedition he is the leader in all matters relating to the war; and also\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters relating to religion have been assigned to the kings. This kingship\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore is a sort of military command vested in generals with absolute powers\n\t\t\t\t\tand held for life; for the king has not authority to put a subject to death,\n\t\t\t\t\texcept in a certain reign as in ancient times kings on their military\n\t\t\t\t\texpeditions could kill an offender out of hand, as Homer proves, for Agamemnon\n\t\t\t\t\tendured being reviled in the assemblies but when they were on an expedition had\n\t\t\t\t\tauthority to put a man to death: at all events he says\n\t\t\t\t\tThis\n\t\t\t\t\tthen is one sort of kingship, a lifelong generalship, and some of the kingships\n\t\t\t\t\tof this kind are hereditary, others elective; and by its side there is another\n\t\t\t\t\tsort of monarchy, examples of which are kingships existing among some of the\n\t\t\t\t\tbarbarians. The power possessed by all of these resembles that of tyrannies, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthey govern according to law and are hereditary;for because the barbarians are more servile in their nature\n\t\t\t\t\tthan the Greeks, and the Asiatics than the Europeans, they endure despotic rule\n\t\t\t\t\twithout any resentment. These kingships therefore are for these reasons of a\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrannical nature, but they are secure because they are hereditary and rule by\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw. Also their bodyguard is of a\n\t\t\t\t\troyal and not a tyrannical type for the same reason; for kings are guarded by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe citizens in arms, whereas tyrants have foreign guards, for kings rule in\n\t\t\t\t\taccordance with law and over willing subjects, but tyrants rule over unwilling\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects, owing to which kings take their guards from among the citizens but\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrants have them to guard against the citizens. These then are two kinds of monarchy; while another is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which existed among the ancient Greeks, the type of rulers called\n\t\t\t\t\t\t. This, to put it simply, is an elective tyranny, and\n\t\t\t\t\tit differs from the monarchy that exists among barbarians not in governing\n\t\t\t\t\twithout the guidance of law but only in not being hereditary. Some holders of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis type of monarchy ruled for life, others until certain fixed limits of time\n\t\t\t\t\tor until certain undertakings were ended, as for example the people of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t once elected Pittacus to\n\t\t\t\t\tresist the exiles under the leadership of Antimenides and the poet Alcaeus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThat they elected Pittacus as tyrant is proved by\n\t\t\t\t\tAlcaeus in one of his catches; for he rebukes the people because \n\t\t\t\t\tThese monarchies therefore now and in the past are of the nature of tyrannies\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they are autocratic, but of the nature of kingships because they are\n\t\t\t\t\telective and rule over willing subjects. A fourth class of royal monarchy consists of the\n\t\t\t\t\thereditary legal kingships over willing subjects in the heroic period. For\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the first of the line had been benefactors of the multitude in the arts\n\t\t\t\t\tor in war, or through having drawn them together or provided them with land,\n\t\t\t\t\tthese kings used to come to the throne with the consent of the subjects and hand\n\t\t\t\t\tit on to their successors by lineal descent. And they had supreme command in war\n\t\t\t\t\tand control over all sacrifices that were not in the hands of the priestly\n\t\t\t\t\tclass, and in addition to these functions they were judges in law-suits; some\n\t\t\t\t\tgave judgement not on oath and some on oaththe oath was taken by\n\t\t\t\t\tholding up the sceptre.\n\t\t\t\t\tThese kings then of ancient times\n\t\t\t\t\tused to govern continuously in matters within the city and in the country and\n\t\t\t\t\tacross the frontiers; but later on when gradually the kings relinquished some of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir powers and had others taken from them by the multitudes, in the cities in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral only the sacrifices were left to the kings, while where anything that deserves the name\n\t\t\t\t\tof royalty survived the kings only had the command in military expeditions\n\t\t\t\t\tacross the frontiers. There are\n\t\t\t\t\tthen these kinds of kingship, four in number: one belonging to the heroic times,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich was exercised over willing subjects, but in certain limited fields, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe king was general and judge and master of religious ceremonies; second, the\n\t\t\t\t\tbarbarian monarchy, which is an hereditary despotism governing in conformity\n\t\t\t\t\twith law; third, the rule of the functionary called an ,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is an elective tyranny; and fourth among these is the Spartan kingship,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich may be described simply as an hereditary generalship held for life. These\n\t\t\t\t\tkingships then differ from one another in this manner. But a fifth kind of kingship is when a single ruler\n\t\t\t\t\tis sovereign over all matters in the way in which each race and each city is\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereign over its common affairs; this monarchy ranges with the rule of a\n\t\t\t\t\tmaster over a household, for just as the master's rule is a sort of monarchy in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe home, so absolute monarchy is domestic mastership over a city, or over a\n\t\t\t\t\trace or several races.There are therefore, we may\n\t\t\t\t\tsay, virtually two kinds of kingship that have been examined, this one and the\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartan. For most of the others lie between these, since with them the king is\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereign over fewer things than under absolute monarchy, but over more than\n\t\t\t\t\tunder the Spartan kingship. Hence our inquiry is virtually about two questions,\n\t\t\t\t\tone whether it is expedient or inexpedient for states to have a military\n\t\t\t\t\tcommander holding office for life, and that either by descent or by class,\n\t\t\t\t\tand one whether it is expedient or inexpedient for one man to be sovereign\n\t\t\t\t\tover everything. Now the study of a\n\t\t\t\t\tmilitary command of the kind mentioned has more the aspect of a legal than of a\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional inquiry for it is possible for this form of office to\n\t\t\t\t\texist under all constitutions, so let it be dismissed at the first\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstage; but the remaining mode\n\t\t\t\t\tof kingship is a kind of constitution, so that it is necessary to consider this\n\t\t\t\t\tone and to run over the difficulties that it involves.And the starting-point of the inquiry is the question whether\n\t\t\t\t\tit is more advantageous to be ruled by the best men or by the best laws.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThose of the opinion that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantageous to be governed by a king think that laws enunciate only general\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples but do not give directions for dealing with circumstances as they\n\t\t\t\t\tarise; so that in an art of any kind it is foolish to govern procedure by\n\t\t\t\t\twritten rules and indeed in  physicians have the right to alter their prescription\n\t\t\t\t\tafter four days, although if one of them alters it before he does so at his own\n\t\t\t\t\trisk; it is clear therefore that government according to written\n\t\t\t\t\trules, that is laws, is not the best, for the same reason. At the same time,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, rulers ought to be in possession of the general principle before\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned as well. And a thing that does not contain the emotional element is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally superior to a thing in which it is innate; now the law does not\n\t\t\t\t\tpossess this factor, but every human soulnecessarily has it. But perhaps someone might say that in compensation for this a single ruler\n\t\t\t\t\twill decide better about particular cases. Therefore it is clear that on the one\n\t\t\t\t\thand the ruler must necessarily be a legislator, and that there must or be laws\n\t\t\t\t\tlaid down, although these must not be sovereign where they go astrayadmittedly in all other cases\n\t\t\t\t\tthey ought to be sovereign; but on the other hand in matters which it is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible for the law either to decide at all or to decide well, ought the one\n\t\t\t\t\tbest man to govern or all the citizens? As it is, the citizens assembled hear\n\t\t\t\t\tlawsuits and deliberate and give judgements, but these judgements are all on\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular cases. Now no doubt any one of them individually is inferior compared\n\t\t\t\t\twith the best man, but a state consists of a number of individuals, and just as\n\t\t\t\t\ta banquet to which many contribute dishes is finer than a single plain dinner,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor this reason in many cases a crowd judges better than any single person.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlso the multitude is more\n\t\t\t\t\tincorruptiblejust as the larger stream of water is purer, so the mass\n\t\t\t\t\tof citizens is less corruptible than the few; and the individual's judgement is\n\t\t\t\t\tbound to be corrupted when he is overcome by anger or some other such emotion,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas in the other case it is a difficult thing for all the people to be\n\t\t\t\t\troused to anger and go wrong together. But the multitude must consist of the\n\t\t\t\t\tfreemen, doing nothing apart from the law except about matters as to which the\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw must of necessity be deficient. And if this is not indeed easy to ensure in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case of many men, yet if there were a majority of good men and good\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens, would an individual make a more incorruptible ruler or rather those\n\t\t\t\t\twho though the majority in number yet are all good? The majority, is\n\t\t\t\t\tit not obvious? But it will be said that they will split up into factions,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas with a single ruler this cannot happen. But against this must perhaps be\n\t\t\t\t\tset the fact that they are as virtuous in soul as the single ruler. If then the rule of the majority when\n\t\t\t\t\tthese are all good men is to be considered an aristocracy, and that of the one\n\t\t\t\t\tman kingship, aristocracy would be preferable for the states to kingship,\n\t\t\t\t\twhether the royal office be conjoined with military force or without it, if it\n\t\t\t\t\tbe possible to get a larger number of men than one who are of similar quality.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd it was perhaps only owing to this that kingships existed in earlier times,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause it was rare to find men who greatly excelled in virtue, especially as in\n\t\t\t\t\tthose days they dwelt in small cities. Moreover they used to appoint their kings\n\t\t\t\t\ton the ground of public service, and to perform this is a task for the good men.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut as it began to come about that many men arose who were alike in respect of\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue, they would no longer submit to royalty, but sought for some form of\n\t\t\t\t\tcommonwealth, and set up a republican constitution. And as men becoming baser began to make money out of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunity, it is reasonable to suppose that some such cause as this occasioned\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rise of oligarchies; for they brought wealth into honor. And from\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchies they first changed to tyrannies, and from tyrannies to democracy;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor by constantly bringing the government into fewer hands owing to a base love\n\t\t\t\t\tof gain, they made the multitude stronger,\n\t\t\t\t\tso that it set upon the oligarchs, and democracies came into\n\t\t\t\t\t\texistence.But now that the states\n\t\t\t\t\thave come to be even greater than they were, perhaps it is not easy for yet\n\t\t\t\t\tanother form of constitution beside democracy to come into existence. And even if one held that royal government\n\t\t\t\t\tis best for states, what is to be the position as regards the king's children?\n\t\t\t\t\tis the sovereignty to be hereditary? But this will be disastrous if the king's\n\t\t\t\t\tsons turn out to be like what some have been. It may be said that the king being\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereign will not in that case bequeath the throne to his children. But that is\n\t\t\t\t\ttoo much to be easy to believe: it would be difficult for a king to disinherit\n\t\t\t\t\this sons, and an act of virtue above the level of human nature. And there is a difficulty also about the\n\t\t\t\t\troyal power: ought the man who is to reign as king to force to have an armed\n\t\t\t\t\tforce about him, by means of which he will have power to compel those who may be\n\t\t\t\t\tunwilling to obey, or if not, how is it possible for him to administer his\n\t\t\t\t\toffice? For even if he were a law-abiding sovereign and never acted according to\n\t\t\t\t\this own will against the law, nevertheless it would be essential for him to have\n\t\t\t\t\tpower behind him whereby to safeguard the laws. Probably therefore it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to define the regulations for a king of this sort: he must have a\n\t\t\t\t\tforce of his own, but the force must be only so large as to be stronger than a\n\t\t\t\t\tsingle individual or even several individuals banded together, but weaker than\n\t\t\t\t\tthe multitude, on the principle on which the men of old times used to assign\n\t\t\t\t\tbodyguards whenever they appointed somebody as what they termed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t or tyrant of the state, and also, when Dionysius asked for his guards, somebody advised\n\t\t\t\t\thim to give the same number of guards to the citizens of . Our\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussion has now reached the case of the king who acts in all matters\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to his own will, and we must examine this type of royalty. For the\n\t\t\t\t\tso-called constitutional monarchy, as we said, is not a special kind of constitution\n\t\t\t\t\tsince it is possible for a life-long generalship to exist under all\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions, for example under a democracy and an aristocracy, and many people\n\t\t\t\t\tmake one man sovereign over the administration, for instance there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment of this sort in , and also\n\t\t\t\t\tat Opus to a certain smaller\n\t\t\t\t\textent; but we have now\n\t\t\t\t\tto discuss what is called Absolute Monarchy, which is the monarchy under which\n\t\t\t\t\tthe king governs all men according to his own will. Some people think that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tentirely contrary to nature for one person to be sovereign over all the citizens\n\t\t\t\t\twhere the state consists of men who are alike; for necessarily persons alike in\n\t\t\t\t\tnature must in accordance with nature have the same principle of justice and the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame value, so that inasmuch as for persons who are unequal to have an equal\n\t\t\t\t\tamount of food or clothing is harmful for their bodies, the same is the case\n\t\t\t\t\talso in regard to honors; similarly\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore it is wrong for those who are equal to have inequality, owing to which\n\t\t\t\t\tit is just for no one person to govern or be governed more than another, and\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore for everybody to govern and be governed alike in turn. And this\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutes law for regulation is law. Therefore it is preferable for the law to\n\t\t\t\t\trule rather than any one of the citizens,and according to this same principle, even if it be better for\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain men to govern, they must be appointed as guardians of the laws and in\n\t\t\t\t\tsubordination to them; for there must be some government, but it is clearly not\n\t\t\t\t\tjust, men say, for one person to be governor when all the citizens are alike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt may be objected that any\n\t\t\t\t\tcase which the law appears to be unable to define, a human being also would be\n\t\t\t\t\tunable to decide. But the law first specially educates the magistrates for the\n\t\t\t\t\tpurpose and then commissions them to decide and administer the matters that it\n\t\t\t\t\tleaves over according to the best of their judgement, and\n\t\t\t\t\tfurthermore it allows them to introduce for themselves any amendment that\n\t\t\t\t\texperience leads them to think better than the established code. He therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tthat recommends that the law shall govern seems to recommend that God and reason\n\t\t\t\t\talone shall govern, but he that would have man govern adds a wild animal also;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor appetite is like a wild animal, and also passion warps the rule even of the\n\t\t\t\t\tbest men. Therefore the law is wisdom without desire. And there seems to be no truth in the analogy which argues\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the arts that it is a bad thing to\n\t\t\t\t\tdoctor oneself by book, but preferable to employ the experts in the arts. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthey never act contrary to principle from motives of friendship, but earn their\n\t\t\t\t\tfee when for instance they have cured their patients,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas holders of political office usually do many things out of spite and to\n\t\t\t\t\twin favor; since when people suspect even the physicians of being in the\n\t\t\t\t\tconfidence of their enemies and of trying to make away with them for gain, in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat case they would sooner look up the treatment in the books. Yet certainly physicians\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves call in other physicians to treat them when they are ill, and\n\t\t\t\t\tgymnastic trainers put themselves under other trainers when they are doing\n\t\t\t\t\texercises, believing that they are unable to judge truly because they are\n\t\t\t\t\tjudging about their own cases and when they are under the influence of feeling.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence it is clear that when men seek for what is just they seek for what is\n\t\t\t\t\timpartial; for the law is that which is impartial. Again,\n\t\t\t\t\tcustomary laws are more\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereign and deal with more sovereign matters than written laws, so that if a\n\t\t\t\t\thuman ruler is less liable to error than written laws, yet he is not less liable\n\t\t\t\t\tto error than the laws of custom. But also it is certainly not easy for the single ruler to oversee a multitude\n\t\t\t\t\tof things; it will therefore be necessary for the officials appointed by him to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe numerous; so that what difference does it make whether this has been the\n\t\t\t\t\tarrangement immediately from the outset or the single ruler appoints them in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis manner? Again, a thing that has also been said before, if the virtuous man\n\t\t\t\t\tjustly deserves to rule because he is better, yet two good men are better than\n\t\t\t\t\tone: for that is the meaning of the line\n\t\t\t\t\t and of the prayer of Agamemnon\n\t\t\t\t\t And even now the magistrates, like the Athenian dicast, have power to\n\t\t\t\t\tjudge certain cases about which the law is unable to give a clear declaration,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince nobody disputes that in matters about which it can do so the law would be\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best ruler and judge. But\n\t\t\t\t\tsince, although some things can be covered by the laws,other things cannot, it is the latter that cause\n\t\t\t\t\tdoubt and raise the question whether it is preferable for the best law to rule\n\t\t\t\t\tor the best man. For to lay down a law about things that are subjects for\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberation is an impossibility. Therefore men do not deny that it must be for\n\t\t\t\t\ta human being to judge about such matters, but they say that it ought not to be\n\t\t\t\t\ta single human being only but a number. For the individual official judges well\n\t\t\t\t\twhen he has been instructed by the law, and it would doubtless seem curious if a person saw better\n\t\t\t\t\twhen judging with two eyes and two organs of hearing and acting with two feet\n\t\t\t\t\tand hands than many persons with many, since even as it is monarchs make many\n\t\t\t\t\teyes and ears and hands and feet their own, for they adopt persons that are\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendly to their rule and to themselves as their fellow-rulers. Although\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore if these assistants are not friendly they will not act in conformity\n\t\t\t\t\twith the monarch's policy, if they are friends of him and of his rule, well, a\n\t\t\t\t\tfriend is one's equal and like, so that if the monarch thinks that his friends\n\t\t\t\t\tought to rule he thinks that people who are equal to and like himself ought to\n\t\t\t\t\trule like himself.This then more or less is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase advanced by those who argue against kingship.But perhaps, although this\n\t\t\t\t\tis a true account of the matter in some cases, it does not apply in others. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is such a thing as being naturally fitted to be controlled by a master,\n\t\t\t\t\tand in another case, to be governed by a king, and in another, for citizenship,\n\t\t\t\t\tand this is just and expedient; but there is no such thing as natural fitness\n\t\t\t\t\tfor tyranny, nor for any other of the forms of government that are divergences,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor these come about against nature. But merely from what has been\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid, it is clear that among people who are alike and equal it is neither\n\t\t\t\t\texpedient nor just for one to be sovereign over allneither when there\n\t\t\t\t\tare no laws, but he himself is in the place of law, nor when there are laws,\n\t\t\t\t\tneither when both sovereign and subjects are good nor when both are bad, nor yet\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the sovereign is superior in virtue, except in a certain manner. What this\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner is must be stated; and in a way it has been stated already even before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut first we must define what\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutes fitness for royal government, what fitness for aristocracy, and what\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a republic. A fit subject for royal government is a populace of such a sort\n\t\t\t\t\tas to be naturally capable of producing a family of outstanding excellence for\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical leadership; a community fit for aristocracy is one that naturally\n\t\t\t\t\tproduces a populace capable of being governed under the form of\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment fit for free men by those who are fitted by virtue for taking the\n\t\t\t\t\tpart of leaders in constitutional government; a republican community, one in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich there naturally grows up a military populace capable of being governed and of governing\n\t\t\t\t\tunder a law that distributes the offices among the well-to-do in accordance with\n\t\t\t\t\tmerit. When therefore it comes\n\t\t\t\t\tabout that there is either a whole family or even some one individual that\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffers from the other citizens in virtue so greatly that his virtue exceeds\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of all the others, then it is just for this family to be the royal family\n\t\t\t\t\tor this individual king, and sovereign over all matters. For, as has been said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore,this holds good not only\n\t\t\t\t\tin accordance with the right that is usually brought forward by those who are\n\t\t\t\t\tfounding aristocratic and oligarchic constitutions, and from the other side by\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who are founding democratic ones for they all make their claim\n\t\t\t\t\ton the ground of superiority, though not the same superiority, but it\n\t\t\t\t\talso holds good in accordance with the right spoken of before.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor it is not seemly to put to\n\t\t\t\t\tdeath or banish, nor yet obviously to ostracize, such a man, nor is it seemly to\n\t\t\t\t\tcall upon him to take his turn as a subject; for it is not in the order of\n\t\t\t\t\tnature for the part to overtop the whole, but the man that is so exceptionally\n\t\t\t\t\toutstanding has come to overtop the whole community. Hence it only remains for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe community to obey such a man, and for him to be sovereign not in turn but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely.Let this be our answer to the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions as regards kingship, what are its varieties, and whether it is\n\t\t\t\t\tdisadvantageous for states or advantageous, and for what states, and under what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions.And since we pronounce the right constitutions to be three, and\n\t\t\t\t\tof these the one governed by the best men must necessarily be the best, and such\n\t\t\t\t\tis the one in which it has come about either that some one man or a whole family\n\t\t\t\t\tor a group of men is superior in virtue to all the citizens together, the latter\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing able to be governed and the former to govern on the principles of the most\n\t\t\t\t\tdesirable life, and since in the first part of the discourse it was proved that the virtue of a man\n\t\t\t\t\tand that of a citizen in the best state must of necessity be the same, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tevident that a man becomes good in the same way and by the same means as one\n\t\t\t\t\tmight establish an aristocratically or monarchically governed state,\n\t\t\t\t\tso that it will be almost the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame education and habits that make a man good and that make him capable as a\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen or a king.These conclusions having been\n\t\t\t\t\tlaid down, we must now endeavor to discuss the best form of constitution and to\n\t\t\t\t\tsay in what way it is natural for it to come into existence and how it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural for it to be organized."}}, {"@n": "4",

Hence it is clear that in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase of the constitution as well it is the business of the same science to study\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is the best constitution and what character it must have to be the most\n\t\t\t\t\tideal if no external circumstance stands in the way, and what constitution is\n\t\t\t\t\tadapted to what people since for many it is doubtless impossible to\n\t\t\t\t\tattain the best one, so that the good lawgiver and the true statesman must be\n\t\t\t\t\tacquainted with both the form of constitution that is the highest absolutely and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is best under assumed conditions, and also thirdly the form\n\t\t\t\t\tof constitution based on a certain supposition for he must be also\n\t\t\t\t\tcapable of considering both how some given constitution could be brought into\n\t\t\t\t\texistence originally and also in what way having been brought into existence it\n\t\t\t\t\tcould be preserved for the longest time: I mean for example if it has befallen\n\t\t\t\t\tsome state not only not to possess the best constitution and to be unprovided\n\t\t\t\t\teven with the things necessary for it, but also not to have the constitution\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is practicable under the circumstances but an inferior one;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand beside all these matters he\n\t\t\t\t\tmust ascertain the form of constitution most suited to all states, since most of\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who make pronouncements about the constitution, even if the rest of what\n\t\t\t\t\tthey say is good, entirely miss the points of practical utility. For it is\n\t\t\t\t\tproper to consider not only what is the best constitution but also what is the\n\t\t\t\t\tone possible of achievement, and likewise also what is the one that is easier\n\t\t\t\t\tand more generally shared by all states. But as it is, some students inquire\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is the highest form of all even though requiring much material\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequipment, while those who\n\t\t\t\t\trather state some general form sweep aside the constitutions actually existing\n\t\t\t\t\tand praise that of  or some\n\t\t\t\t\tother; but the proper\n\t\t\t\t\tcourse is to bring forward an organization of such a sort that men will easily\n\t\t\t\t\tbe persuaded and be able in the existing circumstances to take part in it, since\n\t\t\t\t\tto reform a constitution is no less a task than to frame one from the beginning,\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as to re-learn a science is just as hard as to learn it originally; in\n\t\t\t\t\taddition therefore to the things mentioned the student of politics must also be\n\t\t\t\t\table to render aid to the constitutions that exist already, as was also said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore. But this is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible if he does not know how many kinds of constitution there are; but at\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent some people think that there is only one kind of democracy and one kind\n\t\t\t\t\tof oligarchy, but this is not true. Hence he must take in view the different varieties of the constitutions, and\n\t\t\t\t\tknow how many there are and how many are their combinations. And after this it\n\t\t\t\t\tneeds this same discrimination also to discern the laws that are the best, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthose that are suited to each of the forms of constitution. For the laws should\n\t\t\t\t\tbe laid down, and all people lay them down, to suit the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutionsthe constitutions must not be made to suit the laws; for\n\t\t\t\t\ta constitution is the regulation of the offices of the state in regard to the\n\t\t\t\t\tmode of their distribution and to the question what is the sovereign power in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe state and what is the object of each community, but laws are distinct from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe principles of the constitution, and regulate how the magistrates are to\n\t\t\t\t\tgovern and to guard against thosewho\n\t\t\t\t\ttransgress them. So that clearly it\n\t\t\t\t\tis necessary to be in possession of the different varieties of each form of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, and the number of these, even for the purpose of legislation; for\n\t\t\t\t\tit is impossible for the same laws to be expedient for all oligarchies or\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracies if there are really several kinds of them, and not one sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy or oligarchy only.And inasmuch as in our first inquiry about the forms of the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution we classified the right constitutions as three, kingship,\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracy and constitutional government, and the deviations from these as\n\t\t\t\t\tthree, tyranny from kingship, oligarchy from aristocracy and democracy from\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional government, and about aristocracy and kingship we have spoken\n\t\t\t\t\tfor to study the best constitution is the same thing as to speak about\n\t\t\t\t\tthe forms that bear those names, since each of them means a system based on the\n\t\t\t\t\tqualification of virtue equipped with means, and as also the question\n\t\t\t\t\twhat constitutes the difference between aristocracy and kingship and when a\n\t\t\t\t\troyal government is to be adopted has been decided before, it remains to discuss\n\t\t\t\t\tthe form of constitution designated by the name common to them all, and the other forms, oligarchy,\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy and tyranny. Now it is\n\t\t\t\t\tmanifest also which of these deviations is the worst and which\n\t\t\t\t\tthe second worst. For necessarily the deviation from the first and most divine\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be the worst, and kingship must of\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity either possess the name only, without really being kingship,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor be based on the outstanding superiority of the man who is\n\t\t\t\t\tking; so that tyranny being the worst form must be the one farthest removed from\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional government, and oligarchy must be the second farthest\n\t\t\t\t\tfor aristocracy is widely separated from that constitution,\n\t\t\t\t\twhile democracy must be the most moderate. An account of their relative merits has indeed already\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen given also by one of the former writers, though not on the same principle as ours; for he inclined to judge that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere were good varieties of all the forms, for instance a good sort of\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy and so on, and that democracy was the worst among these, but the best\n\t\t\t\t\tamong the bad varieties, whereas we\n\t\t\t\t\tsay that the deviations are wholly wrong, and that it is not right to speak of\n\t\t\t\t\tone form of oligarchy as better than another, but only as less bad. But let us\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the present dismiss the question of a classification of this nature. Our\n\t\t\t\t\tbusiness is first to distinguish how many different forms of the constitutions\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are, assuming that there do exist several kinds of democracy and of\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy; next, which form is most\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral, and which most desirable after the best constitution, and also if there\n\t\t\t\t\texists some other form that is aristocratic in nature and well constructed but\n\t\t\t\t\tnot fitted to the largest number of cities, which this is; next, which of the\n\t\t\t\t\tother forms too is desirable for what people since probably for some\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy is necessary more than oligarchy, and for others oligarchy more than\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy;and after\n\t\t\t\t\tthis, in what way should one proceed who wishes to set up these constitutions, I\n\t\t\t\t\tmean the various forms of democracy and of oligarchy; and finally, when as far\n\t\t\t\t\tas possible we have concisely touched upon all these questions, we must endeavor\n\t\t\t\t\tto review what are the agencies that destroy and what are those that preserve\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions generally and each variety of constitution in particular, and what\n\t\t\t\t\tare the causes by which it is most natural for these events to be brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout.Now the reason of there being several forms of constitution is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat every city has a considerable number of parts. For in the first place we\n\t\t\t\t\tsee that all the cities are composed of households, and then again that of this\n\t\t\t\t\tmultitude some must necessarily be rich and some poor and some between the two,\n\t\t\t\t\tand also of the rich and the poor the former class is heavy-armed and the latter\n\t\t\t\t\twithout armor. And we see that one portion of the common people is agricultural,\n\t\t\t\t\tanother engaged in trade and another mechanic. And the upper classes have\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinctions also corresponding to their wealth and the amounts of their\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty for example in a stud of horsesfor it is not easy\n\t\t\t\t\tto rear horses without being rich, and this is why in ancient times there were oligarchies in all the states\n\t\t\t\t\twhose strength lay in their cavalry, and they used to use horses for their wars\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst their neighbors, as for instance did the Eretrians and Chalcidians and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people of  on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t and many of the other\n\t\t\t\t\tAsiatic peoples. Moreover in addition to differences in wealth there\n\t\t\t\t\tis the difference of birth, and that in regard to virtue, and indeed any\n\t\t\t\t\tother similar distinction that in the discussion of aristocracy has been stated\n\t\t\t\t\tto constitute a part of the state for there we distinguished how many\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary parts there are of which every state must consist; for\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes all of these parts participate in the constitution and sometimes a\n\t\t\t\t\tsmaller or a larger number of them. It is clear therefore that there must necessarily be several forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution differing in kind from one another, inasmuch as these parts differ\n\t\t\t\t\tin kind among themselves. For a constitution means the arrangement of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistracies, and this all people plan out either according to the power of\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who share political rights, or according to some common equality between\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, I mean for example between the poor or between the rich, or some equality\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon to them both. It follows therefore that there are as many forms\n\t\t\t\t\tof constitution as there are modes of arrangement according to the superiorities\n\t\t\t\t\tand the differences of the sections. But the forms mostly are thought to be twojust as in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe winds we speak of some as north and some as south and regard the rest as\n\t\t\t\t\tdeviations from these, so also of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions there are held to be two forms, democracy and oligarchy; for men\n\t\t\t\t\treckon aristocracy as a kind of oligarchy because it is oligarchy of a sort, and\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is called constitutional government as democracy, just as in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe winds they reckon the west wind as a kind of north wind and the east wind as\n\t\t\t\t\ta kind of south wind.And the case is\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar with musical modes, as some people say: for there too they posit two\n\t\t\t\t\tkinds, the Dorian mode and the Phrygian, and call the other scales some of them\n\t\t\t\t\tDorian and the others Phrygian. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthe most part therefore they are accustomed to think in this way about the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions; but it is truer and better to class them as we did, and assuming\n\t\t\t\t\tthat there are two well-constructed forms, or else one, to say that the others\n\t\t\t\t\tare deviations, some from the well-blended constitution and the others from the\n\t\t\t\t\tbest one, the more tense and masterful constitutions being oligarchic and the\n\t\t\t\t\trelaxed and soft ones demotic.But it is not right to define democracy, as\n\t\t\t\t\tsome people are in the custom of doing now, merely as the constitution in which\n\t\t\t\t\tthe multitude is sovereign for even in oligarchies and everywhere the\n\t\t\t\t\tmajority is sovereign nor oligarchy as the constitution in which a few\n\t\t\t\t\tare sovereign over the government. For if the whole number were thirteen\n\t\t\t\t\thundred, and a thousand of these were rich and did not give the three hundred\n\t\t\t\t\tpoor a share in the government although they were free-born and like themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tin all other respects, no one would say that this people was governed\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocratically; and similarly also if there were few poor, but these more\n\t\t\t\t\tpowerful than the rich who were more numerous, no one would call such a\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment a democracy either, if the other citizens being rich had no share in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe honors. Rather therefore ought\n\t\t\t\t\twe to say that it is a democracy when the free are sovereign and an oligarchy\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the rich are, but that it comes about that the sovereign class in a\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy is numerous and that in an oligarchy small because there are many men\n\t\t\t\t\tof free birth and few rich. For otherwise, suppose people assigned the offices\n\t\t\t\t\tby height, as some persons say is done in , or by beauty, that would be an\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy, because both the handsome and the tall are few in number. Nevertheless it is not enough to define\n\t\t\t\t\tthese constitutions even by wealth and free birth only; but inasmuch as there\n\t\t\t\t\tare more elements than one both in democracy and in oligarchy, we must add the\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther distinction that neither is it a democracy if the free being few\n\t\t\t\t\tgovern the majority who are not of free birth, as for instance at  on the Ionian Gulf and at\n\t\t\t\t\t for in each of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese cities the offices of honor were filled by the specially noble families\n\t\t\t\t\twho had been the first settlers of the colonies, and these were few out of\n\t\t\t\t\tmany, nor is it a democracy if the rich rule because they are in a\n\t\t\t\t\tmajority, as in ancient times at  for there the majority of the population\n\t\t\t\t\towned large property before the war against the Lydians took place,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut it is a democracy when those who are free are in the majority and have\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereignty over the government, and an oligarchy when the rich and more well\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbornare few and sovereign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt has then been stated that there are several forms of constitution, and what\n\t\t\t\t\tis the cause of this; but let us take the starting-point that was laid down\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore and say that there\n\t\t\t\t\tare more forms than those mentioned, and what these forms are, and why they\n\t\t\t\t\tvary. For we agree that every state possesses not one part but several.\n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore just as, in case we intended to obtain a classification of animals, we\n\t\t\t\t\tshould first define the properties necessarily belonging to every animal\n\t\t\t\t\tfor instance some of the sense organs, and the machinery for\n\t\t\t\t\tmasticating and for receiving food, such as a mouth and a stomach, and in\n\t\t\t\t\taddition to these the locomotive organs of the various species,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand if there were only so many\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary parts, but there were different varieties of these I mean\n\t\t\t\t\tfor instance certain various kinds of mouth and stomach and sensory organs, and\n\t\t\t\t\talso of the locomotive parts as well, the number of possible\n\t\t\t\t\tcombinations of these variations will necessarily produce a variety of kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals for it is not possible for the same animal to have several\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent sorts of mouth, nor similarly of ears either, so that when\n\t\t\t\t\tall the possible combinations of these are taken they will all produce animal\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies, and there will be as many species of the animal as there are\n\t\t\t\t\tcombinations of the necessary parts:so in the same way also we shall classify the varieties of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe constitutions that have been mentioned. For states also are composed not of\n\t\t\t\t\tone but of several parts, as has been said often. One of these parts therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tis the mass of persons concerned with food who are called farmers, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsecond is what is called the mechanic class and this is the group\n\t\t\t\t\tengaged in the arts without which it is impossible for a city to be inhabited,\n\t\t\t\t\tand some of these arts are indispensably necessary, while others contribute to\n\t\t\t\t\tluxury or noble living, and third is a commercial class by\n\t\t\t\t\twhich I mean the class that is engaged in selling and buying and in wholesale\n\t\t\t\t\tand retail trade, and fourth is the class of manual laborers, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tfifth class is the one to defend the state in war, which is no less\n\t\t\t\t\tindispensable than the others if the people are not to become the slaves of\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who come against them; for surely it is quite out of the question that it\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be proper to give the name of state to a community that is by nature a\n\t\t\t\t\tslave, for a state is self-sufficient, but that which is a slave is not\n\t\t\t\t\tself-sufficient. Therefore the\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement made in the  is witty but not adequate. For Socrates says that the most necessary\n\t\t\t\t\telements of which a state is composed are four, and he specifies these as a\n\t\t\t\t\tweaver, a farmer, a shoemaker and a builder; and then again he adds, on the\n\t\t\t\t\tground that these are not self-sufficient, a copper-smith and the people to look\n\t\t\t\t\tafter the necessary live-stock, and in addition a merchant and a retail trader.\n\t\t\t\t\tThese elements together constitute the full complement of his first city, implying that every city is formed for the sake of the\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessaries of life and not rather for the sake of what is noble, and that it\n\t\t\t\t\thas equal need of both shoemakers and farmers; but the warrior classhe does not assign to it until as the territory is increased\n\t\t\t\t\tand comes into contact with that of the neighbors they are brought into war. But\n\t\t\t\t\tyet even among the four partners or whatever their number be there must\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily be somebody to assign justice and to judge their claims; inasmuch\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore as one would count the soul of an animal to be more a part of it than\n\t\t\t\t\tthe body, so also the factors in states corresponding to the soul must be deemed\n\t\t\t\t\tto be parts of them more than those factors which contribute to necessary\n\t\t\t\t\tutility,the former being the military class and the class that plays\n\t\t\t\t\ta part in judicial justice, and in addition to these the deliberative class,\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberation being a function of political intelligence. And it makes no\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference to the argument whether these functions are held by special classes\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately or by the same persons; for it often happens for the same men to be both soldiers and farmers. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tinasmuch as both groups of classes must be counted parts of the state, it\n\t\t\t\t\tis clear that the heavy-armed soldiery at any rate must be a part of the state. And a seventh class is the\n\t\t\t\t\tone that serves the community by means of its property, the class that we call\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rich. And an eighth is the class of public servants, that is, those who\n\t\t\t\t\tserve in the magistracies, inasmuch as without rulers it is impossible for a\n\t\t\t\t\tcity to exist; it is therefore necessary that there should be some men who are\n\t\t\t\t\table to govern and who render this service to the state either continuously or\n\t\t\t\t\tin turn. And there remain the classes which we happen to have defined just\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore, the deliberative class and the one that judges the claims of litigants.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf therefore it is proper for the states to have these functions performed, and\n\t\t\t\t\twell and justly performed, it is necessary for there also to be some men\n\t\t\t\t\tpossessing virtue in the form of political excellence. Now as to the other capacities many people think\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is possible for them to be possessed in combination, for example, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same men to be the soldiers that defend the state in war and the farmers\n\t\t\t\t\tthat till the land and the artisans, and also the councillors and judges, and\n\t\t\t\t\tindeed all men claim to possess virtue and think themselves capable of filling\n\t\t\t\t\tmost of the offices of state; but it is not possible for the same men to be poor\n\t\t\t\t\tand rich. Hence these seem to be in the fullest sense the parts of the state,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rich and the poor. And also the fact that the rich are usually few and the\n\t\t\t\t\tpoor many makes these two among the parts of the state appear as opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tsections; so that the superior claims of these classes are even made the guiding principles\n\t\t\t\t\tupon which constitutions are constructed, and it is thought that there are two\n\t\t\t\t\tforms of constitution, democracy and oligarchy.That there are then several\n\t\t\t\t\tforms of constitution, and what are the reasons for this, has been stated\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore; let us now say that there are several varieties both of democracy and of\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy. And this is clear even from what has been said already. For there are\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral classes both of the people and of those called the notables; for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance classes of the people are, one the farmers, another the class dealing\n\t\t\t\t\twith the arts and crafts, another the commercial classoccupied in buying and selling and another the one\n\t\t\t\t\toccupied with the seaand this is divided into the classes concerned\n\t\t\t\t\twith naval warfare, with trade, with ferrying passengers and with fishing\n\t\t\t\t\tfor each of these classes is extremely numerous in various places, for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance fishermen at  and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t, navy men at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t, the mercantile class at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t and , and the ferryman-class at , and in addition to\n\t\t\t\t\tthese the hand-working class and the people possessing little substance so that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey cannot live a life of leisure, also those that are not free men of citizen\n\t\t\t\t\tparentage on both sides, and any other similar class of common people; while\n\t\t\t\t\tamong the notables wealth, birth, virtue, education, and the distinctions that\n\t\t\t\t\tare spoken of in the same group as these, form the classes.The first kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy therefore is the one which receives the name chiefly in respect of\n\t\t\t\t\tequality. For the law of this sort of democracy ascribes equality to the state\n\t\t\t\t\tof things in which the poor have no more prominence than the rich, and neither\n\t\t\t\t\tclass is sovereign, but both are alike; for assuming that freedom is chiefly\n\t\t\t\t\tfound in a democracy, as some persons suppose, and also equality, this would be\n\t\t\t\t\tso most fully when to the fullest extent all alike share equally in the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment. And since the people are in the majority, and a resolution passed by\n\t\t\t\t\ta majority is paramount, this must necessarily be a democracy. This therefore is one kind of democracy,\n\t\t\t\t\twhere the offices are held on property qualifications, but these low ones,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough it is essential that the man who acquires the specified amount should\n\t\t\t\t\thave the right to hold office, and the man who loses it should not hold office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd another kind of democracy is for all the citizens that are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot open to challenge to have a share in office, but for the law to rule;\n\t\t\t\t\tand another kind of democracy is for all to share in the offices on the mere\n\t\t\t\t\tqualification of being a citizen, but for the law to rule. Another kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy is where all the other regulations are the same, but the multitude is\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereign and not the law; and this\n\t\t\t\t\tcomes about when the decrees of the assembly over-ride the law. This state of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings is brought about by the demagogues; for in the states under democratic\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment guided by law a demagogue does not arise, but the best classes of\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens are in the most prominent position; but where the laws are not\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereign, then demagogues arise; for the common people become a single\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposite monarch, since the many are sovereign not as individuals but\n\t\t\t\t\tcollectively. Yet what kind of democracy Homer means by the words no blessing is the lordship of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmanywhether he means this kind or when those who rule as\n\t\t\t\t\tindividuals are more numerous, is not clear. However, a people of this sort, as being monarch, seeks to\n\t\t\t\t\texercise monarchic rule through not being ruled by the law, and becomes\n\t\t\t\t\tdespotic, so that flatterers are held in honor. And a democracy of this nature\n\t\t\t\t\tis comparable to the tyrannical form of monarchy, because their spirit is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame, and both exercise despotic control over the better classes, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tdecrees voted by the assemblyare like\n\t\t\t\t\tthe commands issued in a tyranny, and the demagogues and the flatterers are the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame people or a corresponding class, and either set has the very strongest\n\t\t\t\t\tinfluence with the respective ruling power, the flatterers with the tyrants and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe demagogues with democracies of this kind. And these men cause the resolutions of the assembly to be\n\t\t\t\t\tsupreme and not the laws, by referring all things to the people; for they owe\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir rise to greatness to the fact that the people is sovereign over all things\n\t\t\t\t\twhile they are sovereign over the opinion of the people, for the multitude\n\t\t\t\t\tbelieves them. Moreover those who bring charges against the magistrates say that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people ought to judge the suits, and the people receive the invitation\n\t\t\t\t\tgladly, so that all the magistracies are put down. And it would seem to be a reasonable criticism to say that\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch a democracy is not a constitution at all; for where the laws do not govern\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is no constitution, as the law ought to govern all things while the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates control particulars, and we ought to judge this to be constitutional\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment; if then democracy really is one of the forms of constitution, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tmanifest that an organization of this kind, in which all things are administered\n\t\t\t\t\tby resolutions of the assembly, is not even a democracy in the proper sense, for\n\t\t\t\t\tit is impossible for a voted resolution to be a universal rule.Let this be our discussion of the different kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy.Of the kinds of oligarchy, one is for the magistracies to be\n\t\t\t\t\tappointed from property-assessments so high that the poor who are the majority\n\t\t\t\t\thave no share in the government, but for the man who acquires the requisite\n\t\t\t\t\tamount of property to be allowed to take part in it; another is when\n\t\t\t\t\tthe magistracies are filled from high assessments and the magistrates themselves\n\t\t\t\t\telect to fill vacancies so that if they do so from all the citizens of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis assessment, this appears rather to be of the nature of an aristocracy, but\n\t\t\t\t\tif from a particular section of them, it is oligarchical; another\n\t\t\t\t\tvariety of oligarchy is when son succeeds father in office; and a fourth kind is\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the hereditary system just mentioned exists and also the magistrates govern\n\t\t\t\t\tand not the law. This among oligarchies is the form corresponding to tyranny\n\t\t\t\t\tamong monarchies and to the form of democracy about which we spoke last among\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracies, and indeed oligarchy of this sort has the special name of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdynasty.\n\t\t\t\t\tSo\n\t\t\t\t\tmany therefore are the kinds of oligarchy and of democracy; but it must not\n\t\t\t\t\tescape notice that in many places it has come about that although the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution as framed by the laws is not democratic, yet owing to custom and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe social system it is democratically administered, and similarly by a reverse\n\t\t\t\t\tprocess in other states although the legal constitution is more democratic, yet\n\t\t\t\t\tby means of the social system and customs it is carried on rather as an\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy. This occurs chiefly after alterations of the constitutions have taken\n\t\t\t\t\tplace; for the people do not change over to the new system immediately but are\n\t\t\t\t\tcontent at the first stages to gain small advantages from the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparty,so that the previously\n\t\t\t\t\texisting laws continue although power is in the hands of the party that is\n\t\t\t\t\tchanging the constitution.And that these various kinds of democracy and oligarchy\n\t\t\t\t\texist is manifest from the actual things that have been said. For necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\teither all the parts of the population that have been mentioned must have a\n\t\t\t\t\tshare in the government, or some and not others. When therefore the farmer class\n\t\t\t\t\tand the class possessed of moderate property is sovereign over the government,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey govern according to laws; for they have a livelihood if they work, but are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot able to be at leisure, so that they put the law in control and hold the\n\t\t\t\t\tminimum of assemblies necessary; and the other persons have the right to take\n\t\t\t\t\tpart when they have acquired the property-assessment fixed by the laws, so that\n\t\t\t\t\tto take part in the government is open to all who have got that amount of\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty; since for it not to be open to everybody on any terms at all is a\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristic of oligarchy, but then on the other hand it is impossible for it\n\t\t\t\t\tto be open to them to have leisure if there are no revenues. This then is one kind of democracy\n\t\t\t\t\tfor these reasons. Another kind is\n\t\t\t\t\tdue to the distinction that comes next: it is possible that all the citizens not\n\t\t\t\t\tliable to objection on the score of birth may have the right to take part in the\n\t\t\t\t\tassembly, but may actually take part only when they are able to be at leisure;\n\t\t\t\t\thence in a democracy of this nature the laws govern because there is no revenue.\n\t\t\t\t\tA third kind is when all those who are free men have the right to take part in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe government yet do not do so because of the aforesaid reason, so that it\n\t\t\t\t\tfollows that in this form of democracy also the law governs. And a fourth kind of democracy\n\t\t\t\t\tis the one that has been the last in point of time to come into existence in the\n\t\t\t\t\tstates. Because the states have become much greater than the original ones and\n\t\t\t\t\tpossess large supplies of revenue, while all the citizens have a share in the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment because of the superiority of the multitude, all actually take part in it and\n\t\t\t\t\texercise their citizenship because even the poor are enabled to be at leisure by\n\t\t\t\t\treceiving pay. Indeed the multitude in this kind of state has a very great deal\n\t\t\t\t\tof leisure, for they are not hampered at all by the care of their private\n\t\t\t\t\taffairs, but the rich are, so that often they take no part in the assembly nor\n\t\t\t\t\tin judging lawsuits. Owing to this the multitude of the poor becomes sovereign\n\t\t\t\t\tover the government, instead of the laws. Such in number and in nature are the\n\t\t\t\t\tkinds of democracy that these causes necessarily bring into existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo turn to the varieties and of\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy, when more men possess property, but less of it and not a very large\n\t\t\t\t\tamount, this is the first form of oligarchy; for they allow the man that\n\t\t\t\t\tacquires property the right to participate, and because there is a large number\n\t\t\t\t\tof persons participating in the government it necessarily follows that not the\n\t\t\t\t\tmen but the law is sovereign for the farther removed they are from\n\t\t\t\t\tmonarchy, and as they have not so much property as to be idle and neglect it,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor yet so little as to be kept at the expense of the state,they are compelled to call upon the law to rule\n\t\t\t\t\tinstead of ruling themselves. But then if the owners of the properties are fewer than\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who owned them previously, and own more, the second form of oligarchy\n\t\t\t\t\tcomes into being; for as they become stronger they claim to have a larger share,\n\t\t\t\t\tand therefore they themselves select those from among the rest of the citizens\n\t\t\t\t\twho go into the government, but as they are not yet strong enough to rule\n\t\t\t\t\twithout law they make the law conform with this.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd if they carry matters further by\n\t\t\t\t\tbecoming fewer and holding larger properties, there comes about the third\n\t\t\t\t\tadvance in oligarchy, which consists in their keeping the offices in their own\n\t\t\t\t\thands, but under a law enacting that they are to be hereditary. And when finally\n\t\t\t\t\tthey attain very great pre-eminence by their wealth and their multitude of\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends, a dynasty of this nature is near to monarchy, and men become supreme\n\t\t\t\t\tinstead of the law; and this is the fourth kind of oligarchy, the counterpart of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe last kind of democracy.Furthermore there are two constitutions by the\n\t\t\t\t\tside of democracy and oligarchy, one of which is counted by everybody and has been referred\n\t\t\t\t\tto as one of the four forms of constitution and the four meant are\n\t\t\t\t\tmonarchy, oligarchy, democracy and fourth the form called aristocracy,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut there is a fifth, entitled by the common name of them all for it\n\t\t\t\t\tis called constitutional government, but as it does not often occur it\n\t\t\t\t\tis overlooked by those who try to enumerate the forms of constitution, and they\n\t\t\t\t\tuse the four names only as does Plato in the list of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions. Now the name of\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracy is indeed properly given to the constitution that we discussed in\n\t\t\t\t\tour first discourses for it is right to apply the name\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracygovernment of the\n\t\t\t\t\tbestonly to the constitution of which the citizens are\n\t\t\t\t\tbest in virtue absolutely and not merely good men in relation to some arbitrary\n\t\t\t\t\tstandard, for under it alone the same person is a good man and a good citizen\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely, whereas those who are good under the other constitutions are good\n\t\t\t\t\trelatively to their own form of constitution; nevertheless there are\n\t\t\t\t\talso some constitutions that have differences both in comparison with\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchically governed states and with what is termed constitutional\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment, inasmuch as in them they elect the officials not only by wealth but\n\t\t\t\t\talso by goodness; this form of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution differs from both and is called aristocratic. For even in the\n\t\t\t\t\tstates that do not pay any public attention to virtue there are nevertheless\n\t\t\t\t\tsome men that are held in high esteem and are thought worthy of respect. Where\n\t\t\t\t\tthen the constitution takes in view wealth and virtue as well as the common\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople, as for instance at , this is of the nature of an aristocracy; and so also\n\t\t\t\t\tare the states, in which the constitution, like that of , takes in view two of these things\n\t\t\t\t\tonly, virtue and the common people, and there is a mingling of these two\n\t\t\t\t\tfactors, democracy and virtue. These then are two kinds of aristocracy beside\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first, which is the best constitution,and a third kind is those instances of what is called\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional government that incline more in the direction of\n\t\t\t\t\t\toligarchy.It remains for us to speak about what is termed constitutional\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment and also about tyranny. Though neither the former nor the\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracies spoken of just now are really deviations, we have classed them\n\t\t\t\t\tthus because in actual truth they have all fallen away from the most correct\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, and consequently are counted with the deviation-forms, and those\n\t\t\t\t\tare deviations from them, as we said in our remarks at the beginning.\n\t\t\t\t\tTyranny is reasonably mentioned last because it is the least constitutional of\n\t\t\t\t\tall governments, whereas our investigation is about constitutional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment.Having then stated the reason for\n\t\t\t\t\tthis mode of classification, we have now to set forth our view about\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional government. For its\n\t\t\t\t\tmeaning is clearer now that the characteristics of oligarchy and democracy have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen defined; since constitutional government is, to put it simply, a mixture of\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy and democracy. But people customarily give the name of constitutional\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment only to those among such mixed constitutions that incline towards\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy, and entitle those that incline more towards oligarchy aristocracies,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause education and good birth go more with the wealthier classes, and also\n\t\t\t\t\tthe wealthy are thought to have already the things to get which wrongdoers\n\t\t\t\t\tcommit wrong; owing to which people apply the terms gentry\n\t\t\t\t\tand notabilities to the rich. Since therefore aristocracy means the assignment of the\n\t\t\t\t\thighest place to the best of the citizens, oligarchies also are said to be drawn\n\t\t\t\t\trather from the gentry. And it seems an impossibility for a city governed\n\t\t\t\t\tnot by the aristocracy but by the base to have well-ordered government, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly also for a city that has not a well-ordered government to be governed\n\t\t\t\t\taristocratically. But to have good laws enacted but not obey them does not\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitute well-ordered government. Hence one form of good government must be\n\t\t\t\t\tunderstood to consist in the laws enacted being obeyed, and another form in the\n\t\t\t\t\tlaws which the citizens keep being well enacted for it is possible to\n\t\t\t\t\tobey badly enacted laws. And for laws to be well enacted is possible\n\t\t\t\t\tin two ways: they must either be the best laws possible for the given people or\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best absolutely. But aristocracy\n\t\t\t\t\tin the fullest sense seems to consist in the distribution of the honors\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to virtue; for virtue is the defining factor of aristocracy, as wealth\n\t\t\t\t\tis of oligarchy, and freedom of democracy while the principle that a\n\t\t\t\t\tdecision of the majority is supreme is found in them all: for in both oligarchy\n\t\t\t\t\tand aristocracy and democracies whatever the larger part of those who have a\n\t\t\t\t\tshare in the government decides is supreme. In most states then the name of aristocracy is given to that form of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional government, for the combination aims only at the\n\t\t\t\t\twell-off and the poor, wealth and freedom since in almost the largest\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of states the rich seem to occupy the place of the gentry;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut as there are three things\n\t\t\t\t\tthat claim equal participationin the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, freedom, wealth and virtue for the fourth, what is\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled nobility, accompanies the two latternobility means ancient\n\t\t\t\t\twealth and virtue, it is manifest that the mixture of the two factors,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rich and the poor, ought to be termed\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional government, while the mixture of the three factors deserves the\n\t\t\t\t\tname of aristocracy most of all the various forms of aristocracy beside the true\n\t\t\t\t\tand best form.It has then been stated that other\n\t\t\t\t\tforms of constitution also exist besides monarchy, democracy and oligarchy, and\n\t\t\t\t\twhat their characteristics are, and how the various sorts of aristocracy and of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional government differ from one another; and it is manifest that\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracy and constitutional government are not widely apart from one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother.Next to what has been said let us state the way in which what\n\t\t\t\t\tis called constitutional government comes into existence by the side of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy and oligarchy, and how it is proper to establish it. At the same time\n\t\t\t\t\tthe defining characteristics of democracy and oligarchy will also be clear; for\n\t\t\t\t\twe must grasp the distinction between these and then make a combination out of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, taking, so to say, a contribution from each. And there are three\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples determining this combination or mixture. Under one plan we must adopt both features from the\n\t\t\t\t\tlegislative schemes of the two different constitutions: for example, in regard\n\t\t\t\t\tto the administration of justice, in oligarchies they institute a fine for the\n\t\t\t\t\trich if they do not serve on juries but no pay for the poor for serving, while\n\t\t\t\t\tin democracies they assign pay for the poor but no fine for the rich, but a\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon and intermediate principle is to have both payment and fine, and\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore this is a mark of a constitutional government, since it is a mixture\n\t\t\t\t\tof elements from both oligarchy and democracy. This then is one mode of combining the two. Another\n\t\t\t\t\tis to take the middle course between the regulations of each: for example,\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracies permit membership of the assembly on no property-qualification at\n\t\t\t\t\tall or a quite small one, oligarchies on a large property-qualification, but the\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination clearly is to have neither principle, but one which lies in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle between either of these two qualifications. In the third place is a\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination of the two systems, taking some features from the oligarchical law\n\t\t\t\t\tand some from the democratic; I mean, for example, that it is thought to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocratic for the offices to be assigned by lot, for them to be elected\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchic, and democratic for them not to have a property-qualification,\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchic to have one; therefore it is aristocratic and constitutional to take\n\t\t\t\t\tone feature from one form and the other from the other, from oligarchy that\n\t\t\t\t\toffices are to be elected, and from democracy that this is not to be on a\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty-qualification. This then is the mode of the mixture; and the mark of a good mixture of democracy and\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy is when it is possible to speak of the same constitution as a\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy and as an oligarchy; for manifestly this is so when it is said because\n\t\t\t\t\tthey have been mixed well, and this is the case with the form that lies in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle, for each of the two extreme forms can be seen in it. This is the case with the constitution of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t. For many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeopleendeavor to describe it as\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing a democracy, because its system has many democratic features, for instance\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst of all its regulation for the rearing of boys, since the sons of the rich\n\t\t\t\t\tare brought up in the same way as those of the poor, and are educated in a\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner in which the sons of the poor also could be educated, and they are also\n\t\t\t\t\ttreated similarly at the next age, and in the same manner when they are grown\n\t\t\t\t\tup, for there is nothing that distinguishes the rich man from the poor\n\t\t\t\t\tmanthus the arrangements for food are the same for all at the common\n\t\t\t\t\tmesses, and the rich wear clothes such as even any poor man could procure, and\n\t\t\t\t\talso because of the two greatest offices the common people elect to one and\n\t\t\t\t\tshare in the other they elect the Elders and share in the\n\t\t\t\t\tEphorate; but others call it an oligarchy, because it has many\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchical features, for instance that all the offices are elective and none\n\t\t\t\t\tappointed by lot and few persons have the power to sentence to death and exile,\n\t\t\t\t\tand a number of other such matters. But in a well-constructed mixed constitution both of the two factors, and\n\t\t\t\t\tneither of them, should seem to be present, and\n\t\t\t\t\tit should be kept safe by its own means and not by outside aid, and by its own\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans not because those who desire its security are more numerous outside\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit for\n\t\t\t\t\teven a bad constitution might possess this quality, but because no\n\t\t\t\t\tsection of the state whatever would even wish for another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstitution.The proper way therefore to\n\t\t\t\t\testablish a constitutional government, and similarly also the governments named\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracies, has now been stated. It remained for us to speak\n\t\t\t\t\tof tyranny, not because there is much that can be said about it, but in order\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it may receive its part in our inquiry, since we rank this also as one\n\t\t\t\t\tamong the kinds of constitution. The nature of kingship we have defined in our\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst discourses, in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we examined the question in relation to the constitution most commonly\n\t\t\t\t\tdenoted by the term kingship, whether it is\n\t\t\t\t\tdisadvantageous or an advantage to states, and what person ought to be set up as king, and from what\n\t\t\t\t\tsource, and by what procedure; and in the passage in which we were considering\n\t\t\t\t\tkingship we distinguished two kinds of tyranny, because their power in a manner\n\t\t\t\t\tborders upon royalty, because both these forms of rule are in accordance with\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw for among some of the barbarians they elect monarchic rulers with\n\t\t\t\t\tautocratic powers, and also in old times among the ancient Greeks some men used\n\t\t\t\t\tto become monarchs of this sort, the rulers called\n\t\t\t\t\t, but these two forms of tyranny have certain\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferences from one another, although they were on the one hand of the nature\n\t\t\t\t\tof royalty because they were in accordance with law and because they exercised\n\t\t\t\t\tmonarchic rule over willing subjects, and on the other hand of the nature of a\n\t\t\t\t\ttyranny because they ruled despotically and according to their own judgement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut there is a third kind of\n\t\t\t\t\ttyranny which is thought to be tyranny in the fullest degree, being the\n\t\t\t\t\tcounterpart of universal kingship; to this sort of tyranny must necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong a monarchythat exercises\n\t\t\t\t\tirresponsible rule over subjects all of the same or of a higher class with a\n\t\t\t\t\tview to its own private interest and not in the interest of the persons ruled.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence it is held against the will of the subjects, since no free man willingly\n\t\t\t\t\tendures such rule.These then are the kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\ttyranny and such is their number, for the reasons statedBut what is the best\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution and what is the best mode of life for most cities and most of\n\t\t\t\t\tmankind, if we do not judge by the standard of a virtue that is above the level\n\t\t\t\t\tof private citizens or of an education that needs natural gifts and means\n\t\t\t\t\tsupplied by fortune, nor by the standard of the ideal constitution, but of a\n\t\t\t\t\tmode of life able to be shared by most men and a constitution possible for most\n\t\t\t\t\tstates to attain? For the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions called aristocracies, of which we spoke just now,\n\t\t\t\t\tin some cases fall somewhat out of the scope of most states, and in others\n\t\t\t\t\tapproximate to what is called constitutional government, so that it is proper to\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak of these two forms as if they were one. And indeed the decision in regard\n\t\t\t\t\tto all these questions is based on the same elementary principles. For if it has\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen rightly said in the that the happy life is the life that is lived without\n\t\t\t\t\timpediment in accordance with virtue, and that virtue is a middle course, it\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily follows that the middle course of life is the bestsuch a\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle course as it is possible for each class of men to attain. And these same criteria must also\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily apply to the goodness and badness of a state, and of a\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutionfor a constitution is a certain mode of life of a state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn all states therefore there exist three divisions of the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate, the very rich, the very poor, and thirdly those who are between the two.\n\t\t\t\t\tSince then it is admitted that what is moderate or in the middle is best, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tmanifest that the middle amount of all of the good things of fortune is the best\n\t\t\t\t\tamount to possess. For this degree\n\t\t\t\t\tof wealth is the readiest to obey reason, whereas for a person who is\n\t\t\t\t\texceedingly beautiful or strong or nobly born or rich, or the\n\t\t\t\t\toppositeexceedingly poor or weak or of very mean station, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to follow the bidding of reason; for the former turn more to insolence\n\t\t\t\t\tand grand wickedness, and the latter overmuch to malice and petty wickedness,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the motive of all wrongdoing is either insolence or malice. And moreover the\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle class are the least inclined to shun office and to covet office, and both these tendencies\n\t\t\t\t\tare injurious to states. And in\n\t\t\t\t\taddition to these points, those who have an excess of fortune's goods, strength,\n\t\t\t\t\twealth, friends and the like, are not willing to be governed and do not know how\n\t\t\t\t\tto be and they have acquired this quality even in their boyhood from\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir homelife, which was so luxurious that they have not got used to submitting\n\t\t\t\t\tto authority even in school, while those who are excessively in need\n\t\t\t\t\tof these things are too humble. Hence the latter class do not know how to govern\n\t\t\t\t\tbut know how to submit togovernment\n\t\t\t\t\tof a servile kind, while the former class do not know how to submit to any\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment, and only know how to govern in the manner of a master. The result is a state consisting of slaves\n\t\t\t\t\tand masters, not of free men, and of one class envious and another contemptuous\n\t\t\t\t\tof their fellows. This condition of affairs is very far removed from\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendliness, and from political partnershipfor friendliness is an\n\t\t\t\t\telement of partnership, since men are not willing to be partners with their\n\t\t\t\t\tenemies even on a journey. But surely the ideal of the state is to consist as\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch as possible of persons that are equal and alike, and this similarity is\n\t\t\t\t\tmost found in the middle classes; therefore the middle-class state will\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily be best constituted in respect of those elements of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we say that the state is by nature composed. And also this class of citizens have the greatest security\n\t\t\t\t\tin the states; for they do not themselves covet other men's goods as do the\n\t\t\t\t\tpoor, nor do the other classes covet their substance as the poor covet that of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rich; and because they are neither plotted against nor plotting they live\n\t\t\t\t\tfree from danger. Because of this it was a good prayer of Phocylides \n\t\t\t\t\tIt is clear therefore also that the\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical community administered by the middle class is the best, and that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible for those states to be well governed that are of the kind in which the\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle class is numerous, and preferably stronger than both the other two\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses, or at all events than one of them, for by throwing in its weight it\n\t\t\t\t\tsways the balance and prevents the opposite extremes\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom coming into existence. Hence it is the greatest good fortune if the men\n\t\t\t\t\tthat have political power possess a moderate and sufficient substance,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince where some own a very great deal of property and others\n\t\t\t\t\tnone there comes about either an extreme democracy or an unmixed oligarchy, or a\n\t\t\t\t\ttyranny may result from both of the two extremes, for tyranny springs from both\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy and oligarchy of the most unbridled kind, but much less often from the\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle forms of constitution and those near to them. The cause of this we will\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak of later in our treatment of political revolutions. That the middle form of constitution is the best is\n\t\t\t\t\tevident; for it alone is free from faction, since where the middle class is\n\t\t\t\t\tnumerous, factions and party divisions among the citizens are least likely to\n\t\t\t\t\toccur. And the great states are more free from faction for the same reason,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the middle class is numerous, whereas in the small states it is easy to\n\t\t\t\t\tdivide the whole people into two parties leaving nothing in between, and also\n\t\t\t\t\talmost everybody is needy or wealthy. Also democracies are more secure and more\n\t\t\t\t\tlong-lived than oligarchies owing to the citizens of the middle class\n\t\t\t\t\tfor they are more numerous and have a larger share of the honors in\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracies than in oligarchies, since when the poor are in a majority\n\t\t\t\t\twithout the middle class, adversity sets in and they are soon ruined. And it must be deemed a significant fact\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the best lawgivers are from among the middle citizens; for Solon was of\n\t\t\t\t\tthat class,as appears from his\n\t\t\t\t\tpoetry, and so was Lycurgus for he was not a king and\n\t\t\t\t\tCharondas and almost the greatest number of the other lawgivers.And these considerations also show the reason why the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions of most states are either democratic or oligarchical; owing to the\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle class in these states being often a small one, the classes diverging from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe middle statuswhichever of the two, the owners of the estates or\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people, from time to time has the upper handconduct the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment on their own lines, so that it becomes either a democracy or an\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy. And in addition to this,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause factions occur and fights between the people and the wealthy, whichever\n\t\t\t\t\tparty happens to gain the upper hand over its opponents does not establish a\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon or equal government, but takes the superior share in the government as a\n\t\t\t\t\tprize of victory, and makes it a democracy in the one case and an oligarchy in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other. Moreover each of the two states that in the past held the leadership\n\t\t\t\t\tof  took as a pattern the form of\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment that existed among themselves and set up in the one case democracies\n\t\t\t\t\tand in the other oligarchies in the cities, not considering the interest of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcities but their own advantage. Hence owing to these causes the middle form of constitution either never comes\n\t\t\t\t\tinto existence or seldom and in few places; for one man only among the states that have formerly held the\n\t\t\t\t\tleadership was induced to grant this form of organization, and by this time it\n\t\t\t\t\thas become a fixed habit with the people of the separate cities also not even to\n\t\t\t\t\tdesire equality, but either to seek to rule or to endure being under\n\t\t\t\t\ta master.These considerations therefore make it\n\t\t\t\t\tclear which is the best constitution, and why it is the best; and now that the best has been defined, it\n\t\t\t\t\tis not difficult to see, among the other forms of constitution\n\t\t\t\t\tinasmuch as we pronounce that there are various forms of democracy and\n\t\t\t\t\tvarious oligarchies, what kind is to be placed first, what second, and\n\t\t\t\t\twhat next in this order, by reason of one being better and another worse. For at\n\t\t\t\t\teach stage the form nearest to the best one must necessarily be superior, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe form that is more remote from the middle must be inferiorunless\n\t\t\t\t\tone is judging relatively to given conditions: I make this reservation because\n\t\t\t\t\tit is quite possible that although one form of constitution is preferable it may\n\t\t\t\t\toften be more advantageous for certain people to have another form.The next\n\t\t\t\t\tthing after what has been said is to discuss which constitution is advantageous\n\t\t\t\t\tfor which people, and what sort of constitution for what sort of people. Now we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust first grasp a general principle that applies equally to all sorts of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution: it is essential that the part of the state that wishes the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution to remain should be stronger than the part that does not wish it.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut every state consists of both quality and quantity: by quality I mean\n\t\t\t\t\tfreedom, wealth, education, good birth, and by quantity the superior numbers of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe multitude. And it is possible\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat,while the quality of the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate belongs to one among the parts of which the state consists and its\n\t\t\t\t\tquantity to another partfor example the low-born may be more numerous\n\t\t\t\t\tthan the noble or the poor than the rich, yet the more numerous class may not\n\t\t\t\t\texceed in quantity as much as they fall behind in quality. Hence these two\n\t\t\t\t\tfactors have to be judged in comparison with one another.Where therefore the multitude of the poor exceeds in the\n\t\t\t\t\tproportion stated, here it is natural for there to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy, and each kind of democracy in accordance with the superior number of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe common people of each sort, for example if the number of the farming class\n\t\t\t\t\texceeds, the first sort of democracy, but if that of the common laborers and\n\t\t\t\t\twage-earners, the last sort, and similarly also with the other sorts that lie\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween these two; but where the\n\t\t\t\t\tclass of the well-to-do and notable exceeds in quality more than it falls behind\n\t\t\t\t\tin quantity, here it is natural for there to be an oligarchy, and likewise the\n\t\t\t\t\tvarious kinds of oligarchy according to the degree of superiority of the\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchical multitude. But the lawgiver in his constitution must\n\t\t\t\t\talways take in the middle class; if he is making the laws of an oligarchical\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter he must keep the middle class in view, and if democratic, he must\n\t\t\t\t\tlegislate so as to bring them in. And where the number of the middle class exceeds both the extreme classes\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether, or even one of them only, here it is possible for a constitutional\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment to be lasting; for there is no fear of the rich ever coming to\n\t\t\t\t\tterms with the poor against this numerous middle class; for neither class will\n\t\t\t\t\tever wish to be subject to the other, and if they look for another constitution\n\t\t\t\t\tfairer to both than this they will not find one, for they would not endure to\n\t\t\t\t\ttake turns to govern because they distrust each other: everywhere it is the\n\t\t\t\t\tarbitrator that is most trusted, and the man in the middle is an arbitrator. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthe better the constitution is mixed, the more permanent it is; and many even of those who want to\n\t\t\t\t\testablish aristocratic forms of constitution make a great mistake not only in\n\t\t\t\t\tgiving too large a share to the well-to-do but also in cheating the people; for\n\t\t\t\t\tfalse benefits inevitably result ultimately in true evil, as the encroachments\n\t\t\t\t\tof the rich ruin the constitution more than those of the people.The\n\t\t\t\t\tartifices employed in constitutions as a pretext in regard to the people are\n\t\t\t\t\tfive in number, and are concerned with the assembly, the magistracies, the\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw-courts, the bearing of heavy arms, and gymnastic exercises; in relation to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe assembly, the granting to all of the right to attend but the imposition of a\n\t\t\t\t\tfine for non-attendance on the well-to-do only, or a much larger fine on them\n\t\t\t\t\tthan others; in relation to the magistracies,the denial to the owners of rated property of the right to\n\t\t\t\t\tswear off serving, while the poor have this right; in relation to the\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw-courts, the imposition of a fine on the well-to-do if they do not serve on a\n\t\t\t\t\tjury, but no penalty for the poor, or else a large fine for the one class and a\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall one for the others, as in the laws of Charondas. In some places all have the right to serve in the\n\t\t\t\t\tassembly and on juries after having their names put on a register, but large\n\t\t\t\t\tfines are imposed on those who after so registering fail to attend in either\n\t\t\t\t\tcapacity, in order that the fine may cause them to avoid registration and that\n\t\t\t\t\towing to their not registering they may not serve on juries or in the assembly.\n\t\t\t\t\tThey also legislate in the same manner about owning heavy arms and engaging in\n\t\t\t\t\tgymnastic exercises: the poor are not allowed to possess arms, but the\n\t\t\t\t\twell-to-do are liable to a fine if they have not got them, and there is no fine\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the former class if they abstain from gymnastics, but the well-to-do are\n\t\t\t\t\tliable to a fine, in order that the one class because of the fine may take part\n\t\t\t\t\tin them and the other because they have no penalty to fear may not. These\n\t\t\t\t\tartifices of legislation then are of an oligarchic nature; in democracies they introduce contrary devices in\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to these matters: they provide pay for the poor for serving in the\n\t\t\t\t\tassembly and on juries and impose no fine upon the well-to-do for abstaining.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence it is manifest that if anybody wishes to make a just blend, he must bring\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether the regulations existing in each of the two forms of constitution, and\n\t\t\t\t\tprovide pay for attendance and a fine for non-attendance; for thus all would\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipate, whereas in the other way the government comes to be in the hands of\n\t\t\t\t\tonly one of the two classes. And although it is proper that the government\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be drawn only from those who possess heavy armor, yet it is not possible\n\t\t\t\t\tto define the amount of the property-qualification absolutely and to say that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey must possess so much, but only to consider what sort of amount is the\n\t\t\t\t\thighest that is compatible with making those who have a share in the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution more numerous than those who have not, and to fix that limit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor those who are poor and have\n\t\t\t\t\tno share in the honors are willing to keep quiet if no one insults them or takes\n\t\t\t\t\taway any part of their substance; but this is not easy to secure, for it does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot always happen that those who are in the governing class are gentlemen. Also\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople have a way of being reluctant to serve when there is a war if they do not\n\t\t\t\t\tget rations and are poor men but; if somebody provides food they want to fight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn some states the\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen-body consists not only of those who are serving as heavy-armed soldiers,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut also of those who have so served; and at Malea the citizen-body consisted of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese, while the magistrates were elected from those who were actually on\n\t\t\t\t\tservice. And indeed the earliest form of constitution among the Greeks after the\n\t\t\t\t\tkingships consisted of those who were actually soldiers, the original form\n\t\t\t\t\tconsisting of the cavalry for war had its strength and its\n\t\t\t\t\tpre-eminence in cavalry, since without orderly formation heavy-armed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfantryis useless, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tsciences and systems dealing with tactics did not exist among the men of old\n\t\t\t\t\ttimes, so that their strength lay in their cavalry; but as the states\n\t\t\t\t\tgrew and the wearers of heavy armor had become stronger, more persons came to\n\t\t\t\t\thave a part in the government. Hence what we now call constitutional governments\n\t\t\t\t\tthe men of former times called democracies; but the constitutional governments of early days were\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally oligarchical and royal, for owing to the smallness of the populations\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir middle class was not numerous, so that because of their small numbers as\n\t\t\t\t\twell as in conformity with the structure of the state the middle class more\n\t\t\t\t\treadily endured being in a subject position.It\n\t\t\t\t\thas then been said what is the reason of there being several forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, and why there are others besides those designated by name\n\t\t\t\t\tfor there is not one single democracy only, and similarly there are\n\t\t\t\t\tmore than one of the other forms, and also what are the differences\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween them and what is the reason why these differences occur, and in addition\n\t\t\t\t\tto these points, which is the best of the constitutions speaking generally, and\n\t\t\t\t\tof the other constitutions which sort is suited to which sort of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople.And again, let us speak about the points that come next, both\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally and with reference to each constitution separately, taking their\n\t\t\t\t\tappropriate starting-point. All forms of constitution then have three factors in\n\t\t\t\t\treference to which the good lawgiver has to consider what is expedient for each\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution; and if these factors are well-ordered the constitution must of\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity be well-ordered, and the superiority of one constitution over another\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily consists in the superiority of each of these factors. Of these three\n\t\t\t\t\tfactors one is, what is to be the body that deliberates about the common\n\t\t\t\t\tinterests, second the one connected with the magistracies, that is, what\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are to be and what matters they are to control, and what is to be the\n\t\t\t\t\tmethod of their election, and a third is, what is to be the judiciary.The deliberative factor is sovereign about war and peace\n\t\t\t\t\tand the formation and dissolution of alliances, and about laws, and about\n\t\t\t\t\tsentences of death and exile and confiscation of property, and about the audits\n\t\t\t\t\tof magistrates. And necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\teither all these decisions must be assigned to all the citizens, or all to some\n\t\t\t\t\tof them for instance to some one magistracy or to several,\n\t\t\t\t\tor different ones to different magistracies, or some of them to all the citizens\n\t\t\t\t\tand some to certain persons.For all the citizens\n\t\t\t\t\tto be members of the deliberative body and to decide all these matters is a mark\n\t\t\t\t\tof a popular government, for the common people seek for equality of this nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut there are several modes of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch universal membership. One is for the citizens to serve in rotation and not\n\t\t\t\t\tall in a body as is enacted in the constitution of the Milesian\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTelecles, and in\n\t\t\t\t\tother constitutions also the boards of magistrates deliberate in joint\n\t\t\t\t\tassemblies but all the citizens enter into the magistracies from the tribes or\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the very smallest sections of the citizen-body in rotation until office has\n\t\t\t\t\tgone through the whole body, and for there to be joint assemblies only\n\t\t\t\t\tto consider legislation and reforms of the constitution and to hear the reports\n\t\t\t\t\tsubmitted by the magistrates. Another mode isfor all to assemble\n\t\t\t\t\tin a body, but only for the purpose of electing magistrates, enacting laws,\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidering the declaration of war and the conclusion of peace and holding the\n\t\t\t\t\taudit of magistrates, but for all other matters to be considered by the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates appointed to deal with each respectively and elected by suffrage or\n\t\t\t\t\tby lot from all the citizens. Another mode is for the citizens to meet about the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistracies and the audits and in order to deliberate about declaring war and\n\t\t\t\t\tconcluding an alliance, but for all other matters to be dealt with by the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates, elected by suffrage in as many cases as circumstances allow, and such\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistracies are all those which must of necessity be filled by experts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA fourth mode is for all to\n\t\t\t\t\tmeet in council about all matters, and for the magistracies to decide about\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing but only to make preliminary decisions; this is the mode in which\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy in its last form is administered at the present daythe form\n\t\t\t\t\tof democracy which we pronounce to correspond to dynastic oligarchy and to\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrannical monarchy. These modes\n\t\t\t\t\tthen are all of them democratic. On the other hand for some persons to\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberate upon all matters is oligarchic. But this also has several variations.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor when the members of the deliberative body are elected on comparatively\n\t\t\t\t\tmoderate property-qualifications, and the eligible persons are comparatively\n\t\t\t\t\tnumerous because of the moderateness of the qualification, and when they do not\n\t\t\t\t\tmake changes in things in which the law forbids it but follow the law, and when\n\t\t\t\t\tanybody acquiring the property-qualification is allowed to become a member, a\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution of this sort is indeed an oligarchy, but one of the nature of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional government, because of its moderation. When on the other hand not\n\t\t\t\t\teverybody thus qualified participates in deliberation but only certain persons\n\t\t\t\t\tpreviously chosen by election, and these govern in accordance with law as in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe former case, this is oligarchical; and also when the deliberative officials\n\t\t\t\t\tare elected by co-optation, and when the office is hereditary and has supreme\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrol over the laws, this system is bound to be oligarchical. But when certain persons control certain\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters, for instance when all the citizens control decisions as to war and\n\t\t\t\t\tpeace and the audit of officials while everything else is controlled by\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates and these are elected by vote, not by lot, the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution is an aristocracy; while if some matters are controlled by\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates elected by vote and others by magistrates chosen by lot, and this\n\t\t\t\t\teither directly or from a list previously selected by vote, or if magistrates\n\t\t\t\t\telected by vote and by lot sit in a joint body, some of these regulations are\n\t\t\t\t\tfeatures of an aristocratic constitution and others of constitutional government\n\t\t\t\t\t\titself.We have then in this way distinguished\n\t\t\t\t\tthe different kinds of deliberative body in relation to the forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, and each form of constitution carries on the administration in\n\t\t\t\t\taccordance with the distinction stated. But for a democracy of the form that at the present day is\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidered to be democracy in the fullest degree and I mean one of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsort in which the people is sovereign even over the laws it is\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantageous for the improvement of its deliberative function for it to do the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame as is done in oligarchies in the matter of the law-courts for\n\t\t\t\t\tthey enact a fine to compel the attendance on juries of those whom they want to\n\t\t\t\t\tattend, whereas democratic states institute payment for attendance for the\n\t\t\t\t\tbenefit of the poor, and also to do this in respect of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassembliesfor they will\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberate better when all are deliberating jointly, the common people when with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe notables and these when with the masses, and it is also\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantageous for those who deliberate to be elected by vote or by lot equally\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the different sections, and, if the men of the people far exceed the\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical class in number, it is advantageous either not to give pay to all but\n\t\t\t\t\tonly to as many as are commensurate with the number of the notables, or to\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscard by lot those who exceed this number. In oligarchies on the other hand it is advantageous either\n\t\t\t\t\tto co-opt some persons from the multitude, or to institute an office like the\n\t\t\t\t\tone that exists in certain constitutional governments under the flame of\n\t\t\t\t\tPreliminary Councillors or Guardians of the Law, and deal with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe matters about which these officials have held a preliminary deliberation\n\t\t\t\t\tfor thus the common people will have a share in deliberation and will\n\t\t\t\t\tnot have the power to abolish any part of the constitution, and then\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the people by their vote either to confirm or at all events not to pass\n\t\t\t\t\tanything contrary to the resolutions brought before them, or to allow all to\n\t\t\t\t\ttake part in debate but only the magistrates to frame resolutions; and in fact it is proper to do just the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite of what takes place in constitutionally governed states; for the common\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople ought to be given power to vote the rejection of a measure, but not to\n\t\t\t\t\tvote its ratification, but it should be referred back to the magistrates. In\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional governments the procedure is the reverse; the few are competent\n\t\t\t\t\tto vote the rejection of a resolution but are not competent to vote its\n\t\t\t\t\tratification, this being always referred back to the most numerous body.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLet us then decide in this\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner about the deliberative body, which in fact is the sovereign power in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstitution.Connected with this subject is the determination in regard to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe magistracies for this part of the constitution also has many\n\t\t\t\t\tvarieties, how many magistracies there are to be, and what are to be\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir powers, and what their various periods of tenure for some people\n\t\t\t\t\tmake their magistracies tenable for six months, others for less, others for a\n\t\t\t\t\tyear and others for a longer periodshall the magistracies\n\t\t\t\t\tbe for life or for a long period, or if for a shorter term shall the same people\n\t\t\t\t\tbe allowed to hold them several times or not the same man twice but once only?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand also as to the appointment\n\t\t\t\t\tof magistrates, who shall be eligible, who the electors, and what the mode of\n\t\t\t\t\telection? For on all these points it is needful to be able to determine how many\n\t\t\t\t\tmodes of procedure are possible, and then to settle what modes are expedient for\n\t\t\t\t\twhat sorts of constitution. Nor is it easy to decide to what kinds of office the\n\t\t\t\t\tname of magistracy ought to be applied; for the political community requires a\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat many officials, owing to which it is not proper to reckon all of them\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates, whether elected by vote or by lot,for instance first the\n\t\t\t\t\tpriests for this office must be considered as something different from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe political magistracies, and again there are leaders of choruses,\n\t\t\t\t\tand heralds, and persons are also elected as ambassadors.And of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe offices exercising superintendence some are political, and are exercised\n\t\t\t\t\teither over the whole of the citizens in regard to some operationfor\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance a general superintends them when serving as soldiers, or over a\n\t\t\t\t\tsectionfor instance the superintendent of women or of children; while\n\t\t\t\t\tothers are economic for states often elect officers to dole out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorn; and others are subordinate, and are the sort of services\n\t\t\t\t\tto which people when well off appoint slaves. But the title of magistracy, to\n\t\t\t\t\tput it simply, is chiefly to be applied to all those offices to which have been\n\t\t\t\t\tassigned the duties of deliberating about certain matters and of acting as\n\t\t\t\t\tjudges and of issuing orders, and especially the last, for to give orders is\n\t\t\t\t\tmost characteristic of authority. But this question is of virtually no practical\n\t\t\t\t\timportance for no decision has yet been given, our discussion being\n\t\t\t\t\tmerely about the name, although it does admit of some further inquiry\n\t\t\t\t\tof a speculative kind. On the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand the questions what kinds and what number of magistracies are necessary to\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitute a state at all, and what kinds although not necessary are\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantageous for a good constitution, are questions that might preferably be\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed, both indeed as regards every form of constitution and particularly in\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to the small states. For it is true that in the large states it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible and proper for one magistracy to be assigned to one function\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the large number of the citizens makes it possible for many people\n\t\t\t\t\tto enter on an official career, so as to intermit their tenure of some offices\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a long time and to hold others only once, and also every task is better\n\t\t\t\t\tattended to if the attention is directed to one thing only than if it is busy\n\t\t\t\t\twith many; but in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe small states it is inevitable that many offices must be gathered into few\n\t\t\t\t\thands for owing to shortage of manpower it is not easy for many people\n\t\t\t\t\tto be in office, since who will take over the posts as their\n\t\t\t\t\tsuccessors?. But sometimes small states require the same magistracies\n\t\t\t\t\tand laws as large ones except that the latter require the same persons to serve\n\t\t\t\t\toften, but in the former this only occurs after a long interval. Hence it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible to assign several duties to one man at the same time since\n\t\t\t\t\tthey will not interfere with one another, and to meet the shortage of\n\t\t\t\t\tman-power it is necessary to make the magistracies like spit-lampholders.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf therefore we are able to say how\n\t\t\t\t\tmany magistracies every state must necessarily possess and how many, though not\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely necessary, it ought to possess, knowing these points one might more\n\t\t\t\t\teasily make a combination of those magistracies which are of a suitable nature\n\t\t\t\t\tto be combined into a single office. And it is suitable for the further question\n\t\t\t\t\tnot to be overlooked, what kinds of matters ought to be attended to by a number\n\t\t\t\t\tof officials locally distributed and what ought to be under the authority of one\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrate for all localities, for example should good order be seen to in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmarket-place by a Controller of the Market and elsewhere by another official, or\n\t\t\t\t\teverywhere by the same one? and ought the offices to be divided according to the\n\t\t\t\t\tfunction or according to the persons concernedI mean, for instance,\n\t\t\t\t\tshould there be a single official in control of good order, or a different\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonefor children and for women?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand also under the various\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions does the nature of the magistracies vary in accordance with each\n\t\t\t\t\tor does it not vary at allfor example in democracy, oligarchy,\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracy and monarchy are the magistracies the same in their powers, although\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are not filled from equal ranks nor from similar classes but are different\n\t\t\t\t\tin different constitutions for example in aristocracies drawn from the\n\t\t\t\t\teducated, in oligarchies from the wealthy, and in democracies from the\n\t\t\t\t\tfree, or although some constitutions happen to be correspondent with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe actual differences of their magistracies, yet in other cases are the same\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistracies advantageous even where the constitutions differ for in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome places it is suitable for the same magistracies to have large functions and\n\t\t\t\t\tin other places small ones? Not but what there are also some offices peculiar to\n\t\t\t\t\tspecial forms of constitution, for instance the office of Preliminary\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCouncillors. This\n\t\t\t\t\tis undemocratic, although a Council is a popular body, for there is bound to be\n\t\t\t\t\tsome body of this nature to have the duty of preparing measures for the popular\n\t\t\t\t\tassembly, in order that it may be able to attend to its business; but a\n\t\t\t\t\tpreparatory committee, if small, is oligarchical, and Preliminary Councillors\n\t\t\t\t\tmust necessarily be few in number, so that they are an oligarchical element. But\n\t\t\t\t\twhere both of these magistracies exist, the Preliminary Councillors are in\n\t\t\t\t\tauthority over the Councillors, since a councillor is a democratic official, but\n\t\t\t\t\ta preliminary councillor is an oligarchic one. Also the power of the Council is weakened in democracies\n\t\t\t\t\tof the sort in which the people in assembly deals with everything itself;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand this usually happens when there is a plentiful supply of\n\t\t\t\t\tpay for those who attend the assembly, for being at leisure they meet frequently\n\t\t\t\t\tand decide all things themselves. But a Superintendent of Children and a\n\t\t\t\t\tSuperintendent of Women, and any other magistrates that exercise a similar sort\n\t\t\t\t\tof supervision, are an aristocratic feature, and not democratic for\n\t\t\t\t\thow is it possible to prevent the wives of the poor from going out of doors? nor yet oligarchic for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe wives of oligarchic rulers are luxurious. But let the discussion of these matters go no\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther at present, and let us attempt to go through from the beginning the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion of the ways of appointing the magistrates. The varieties here depend on\n\t\t\t\t\tthree determinants, the combinations of which must give all the possible modes.\n\t\t\t\t\tOne of these three determining points is, who are the persons who appoint the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates? the second is, from whom? and last, in what manner? And of each of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese three determinants there are three variations: either all the citizens\n\t\t\t\t\tappoint or some, and either from all or from a certain class defined\n\t\t\t\t\tfor instance by property-assessment or birth or virtue or some other such\n\t\t\t\t\tqualification, as at  only\n\t\t\t\t\tthose were eligible who returned in a body from exile and fought together\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst the common people, and the mode of\n\t\t\t\t\tappointment may be either by vote or by lot; again, these systems may be coupled\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogetherI mean that\n\t\t\t\t\tsome citizens may appoint to some offices but all to others, and to some offices\n\t\t\t\t\tall citizens may be eligible but to others only a certain class, and to some\n\t\t\t\t\tappointment may be by vote but to others by lot. And of each variation of these\n\t\t\t\t\tdeterminants there will be four modes: either all citizens may appoint from all\n\t\t\t\t\tby vote, or all from all by lotand from all either section by\n\t\t\t\t\tsection, for instance by tribes or demes or brotherhoods until the procedure has\n\t\t\t\t\tgone through all the citizens, or from the whole number every time,or\n\t\t\t\t\telse partly in one way and partly in the other. Again, if the electors are some\n\t\t\t\t\tof the citizens, they must either appoint from all by vote, or from all by lot,\n\t\t\t\t\tor from some by vote, or from some by lot, or partly in one way and partly in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe otherI mean partly by vote and partly by lot. Hence the modes\n\t\t\t\t\tprove to be twelve, apart from the two combinations. And among these, two ways of appointment are\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocraticfor all to appoint from all by vote, or by lot, or by\n\t\t\t\t\tbothsome offices by lot and others by vote; but for not all to be the\n\t\t\t\t\telectors and for them to appoint simultaneously, and either from all or from\n\t\t\t\t\tsome either by lot or by vote or by both, or some offices from all and others\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom some by both by which I mean some by lot and others by\n\t\t\t\t\tvote is constitutional. And for some to appoint from all, to some\n\t\t\t\t\toffices by vote and to others by lot or by both to some by lot and to others by\n\t\t\t\t\tvote is oligarchical; and it is even more oligarchical to appoint from\n\t\t\t\t\tboth classes. But to appoint some\n\t\t\t\t\toffices from all and the others from a certain class is constitutional with an\n\t\t\t\t\taristocratic bias; or to appoint some by vote and others by lot. And\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a certain class to appoint from a certain class <by vote> is oligarchical, and so it is for a certain class to appoint\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom a certain class by lot although not working out in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tway, and for a certain class to appoint from a certain class by both\n\t\t\t\t\tmethods. And for a certain class to make a preliminary selection from the whole\n\t\t\t\t\tbody and then for all to appoint from among certain persons thus\n\t\t\t\t\tselected is aristocratic.So many in\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber therefore are the modes of appointing to the magistracies, and this is\n\t\t\t\t\thow the modes are classified according to the different constitutions; and what\n\t\t\t\t\tregulations are advantageous for what people and how the appointments ought to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe conducted will be made clear at the same time as we consider what are the\n\t\t\t\t\tpowers of the offices. By the power of an office I mean for instance the control\n\t\t\t\t\tof the revenues and the control of the guard; since a different sort of power\n\t\t\t\t\tbelongs for example to a generalship and to the office that controls market\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontracts.Of the three factors of a constitution it remains to speak of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe judiciary, and of judicial bodies also we must consider the various modes,\n\t\t\t\t\tin accordance with the same plan. And a difference among judicial courts rests\n\t\t\t\t\tupon three determinantsconstituents, sphere of action, and mode of\n\t\t\t\t\tappointment. As to their constituents I mean are the courts drawn from all the\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens or from a certain class? as to sphere of action, how many kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\tcourts are there? and as to mode of appointment, are they appointed by lot or by\n\t\t\t\t\tvote? First then let us distinguish how many kinds of courts there are. They are\n\t\t\t\t\teight in number, one a court of audit,another to deal with offenders against any public interest, another with\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters that bear on the constitution, a fourth for both magistrates and private\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons in disputes about penalties, fifth the court dealing with private\n\t\t\t\t\tcontracts that are on an important scale, and beside these there is\n\t\t\t\t\t6 the court that tries homicide, and 7\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which hears alien suits of courts of homicide there are four kinds, whether the jury is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame or differentnamely, for cases of deliberate homicide, of\n\t\t\t\t\tinvoluntary homicide, of homicide admitted but claimed to be justifiable, and\n\t\t\t\t\tfourth to deal with charges of homicide brought against men that have fled from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe country for homicide, upon their return, such as at  for instance the Court at Phreatto is said to be,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough such cases are of rare occurrence in the whole course of history, even\n\t\t\t\t\tin the great states and of the aliens' court one branch hears suits of aliens\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst aliens and another of aliens against citizens; and also beside\n\t\t\t\t\tall of these there are 8 courts to try cases of petty\n\t\t\t\t\tcontracts, involving sums of one drachma, five drachmas or a little\n\t\t\t\t\tmorefor even these cases have to be tried, though they are not\n\t\t\t\t\tsuitable for a numerous jury. But\n\t\t\t\t\tlet us dismiss the subject of these petty suits, and the courts for homicide and\n\t\t\t\t\tthose for aliens, and let us speak about political trials, which when not well\n\t\t\t\t\tconducted cause party divisions and revolutionary disturbances. And necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\teither all the judges of all the cases that have been classified will be\n\t\t\t\t\tappointed by vote, or by lot, or all in all cases partly by lot and partly by\n\t\t\t\t\tvote, or in some cases some judges will be appointed by lot and others by vote\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the same case. These modes then are four in number, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tsectional modes also make as many others; for here again the judges for all\n\t\t\t\t\tcases may be drawn by vote from a certain class, or for all cases by lot from a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain class, or some courts may be appointed by lot and others by vote, or\n\t\t\t\t\tsome courts may be composed of judges chosen by lot and by vote for the same\n\t\t\t\t\tcases. These then are the modes, as was said, corresponding to those mentioned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd there are also the same\n\t\t\t\t\tcourts in combinationI mean for example some drawn from the whole\n\t\t\t\t\tbody and some from a class and some from both, as for instance if the same court\n\t\t\t\t\tcontained some members from the whole body and others from a class, and\n\t\t\t\t\tappointed either by lot or by vote or both. We have then stated all the modes in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it is possible for the courts to be composed; and of these the first set,\n\t\t\t\t\tdrawn from all the citizens and dealing with all cases, are popular, the second,\n\t\t\t\t\tdrawn from a certain class to deal with all cases, are oligarchic, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tthird, drawn partly from all and partly from a certain class, are suited to an\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracy and to a constitutional government."}}, {"@n": "5", "@type": "Book", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1301a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "19", "@ed": "Bekker", "@unit": "line"},

"perseus,Carthage", "#text": "Carthage"}], "title": "Law and Order", "#text": "Almost all the\n\t\t\t\t\tother subjects which we intended to treathave now been discussed. There must follow the consideration of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe questions, what are the number and the nature of the causes that give rise\n\t\t\t\t\tto revolutions in constitutions, and what are the causes that destroy each form\n\t\t\t\t\tof constitution, and out of what forms into what forms do they usually change,\n\t\t\t\t\tand again what are the safeguards of constitutions in general and of each form\n\t\t\t\t\tin particular, and what are the means by which the safeguarding of each may best\n\t\t\t\t\tbe put into effect.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd\n\t\t\t\t\twe must first assume the starting-point, that many forms of constitution have\n\t\t\t\t\tcome into existence with everybody agreeing as to what is just, that is\n\t\t\t\t\tproportionate equality, but failing to attain it as has also been said\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore. Thus democracy arose from men's thinking that if they are\n\t\t\t\t\tequal in any respect they are equal absolutely for they suppose that\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they are all alike free they are equal absolutely, oligarchy\n\t\t\t\t\tarose from their assuming that if they are unequal as regards some one thing\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are unequal wholly for being unequal in property they assume that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are unequal absolutely; and then the democrats claim as being equal to participate\n\t\t\t\t\tin all things in equal shares, while the oligarchs as being unequal seek to have\n\t\t\t\t\ta larger share, for a larger share is unequal. All these forms of constitution\n\t\t\t\t\tthen have some element of justice, but from an absolute point of view they are\n\t\t\t\t\terroneous; and owing to this cause, when each of the two parties has not got the\n\t\t\t\t\tshare in the constitution which accords with the fundamental assumption that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey happen to entertain, faction ensues. And of all men those who excel in\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue would most justifiably stir up faction, though they are least given to\n\t\t\t\t\tdoing so; for they alone can with the fullest reason be deemed absolutely\n\t\t\t\t\tunequal. And there are some men who being superior in birth claim unequal rights\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause of this inequality; for persons who have ancestral virtue and wealth\n\t\t\t\t\tbehind them are thought to be noble.These then roughly speaking are the\n\t\t\t\t\tstarting-points and sources of factions, which give rise to party strife\n\t\t\t\t\tand revolutions due to this take place in two ways: sometimes they are\n\t\t\t\t\tin regard to the constitution, and aim at changing from the one established to\n\t\t\t\t\tanother, for instance from democracy to oligarchy, or to democracy from\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy, or from these to constitutional government and aristocracy, or from\n\t\t\t\t\tthose to these; but sometimes the revolution is not in regard to the established\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, but its promoters desire the same form of government, for instance\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy or monarchy, but wish it to be in their own control. Again it may be a question of degree; for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance, when there is an oligarchy the object may be to change to a more\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchical government or to a less, or when there is a democracy to a more or\n\t\t\t\t\tto a less democratic government, and similarly in the case of the remaining\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions, the aim may be either to tighten them up or to relax them. Or\n\t\t\t\t\tagain the aim may be to change a certain part of the constitution, for example\n\t\t\t\t\tto establish or abolish a certain magistracy, as according to some accounts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLysanderattempted to abolish the\n\t\t\t\t\tkingship at  and the king\n\t\t\t\t\tPausanias the ephorate; and also at  the constitution was altered in\n\t\t\t\t\tpart, for they set up a council instead of the tribal rulers, and it is still\n\t\t\t\t\tcompulsory for the magistrates alone of the class that has political power to\n\t\t\t\t\tcome to the popular assembly when an appointment to a magistracy is put to the\n\t\t\t\t\tvote; and the single supreme magistrate was also an oligarchical feature in this\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution. For party strife is everywhere due to inequality, where\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses that are unequal do not receive a share of power in proportion\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a lifelong monarchy is an unequal feature when it exists among\n\t\t\t\t\tequals; for generally the motive for factious strife is the desire for\n\t\t\t\t\tequality. But equality is of two\n\t\t\t\t\tkinds, numerical equality and equality according to worthby\n\t\t\t\t\tnumerically equal I mean that which is the same and equal in number or\n\t\t\t\t\tdimension, by equal according to worth that which is equal by proportion; for instance numerically 3 exceeds 2\n\t\t\t\t\tand 2 exceeds 1 by an equal amount, but by proportion 4 exceeds 2 and 2 exceeds\n\t\t\t\t\t1 equally, since 2 and 1 are equal parts of 4 and 2, both being halves. But\n\t\t\t\t\talthough men agree that the absolutely just is what is according to worth, they\n\t\t\t\t\tdisagree as was said before in that some think that if they are\n\t\t\t\t\tequal in something they are wholly equal, and others claim that if they are\n\t\t\t\t\tunequal in something they deserve an unequal share of all things. Owing to this two principal varieties of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution come into existence, democracy and oligarchy; for noble birth and\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue are found in few men, but the qualifications specified in more:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnowhere are there a hundred men nobly born and good, but there\n\t\t\t\t\tare rich men in many places. But for the constitution to be\n\t\t\t\t\tframed absolutely and entirely according to either kind of equality is bad. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is proved by experience, for not one of the constitutions formed on such\n\t\t\t\t\tlines is permanent. And the cause of this is that it is impossible for some evil\n\t\t\t\t\tnot to occur ultimately from the first and initial error that has been made.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence the proper course is to employ numerical equality in some things and\n\t\t\t\t\tequality according to worth in others. But nevertheless democracy is safer and more free from\n\t\t\t\t\tcivil strife than oligarchy; for in oligarchies two kinds of strife spring up,\n\t\t\t\t\tfaction between different members of the oligarchy and also faction between the\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchs and the people, whereas in democracies only strife between the people\n\t\t\t\t\tand the oligarchical party occurs, but party strife between different sections\n\t\t\t\t\tof the people itself does not occur to any degree worth mentioning. And again\n\t\t\t\t\tthe government formed of the middle classes is nearer to the people than to the\n\t\t\t\t\tfew, and it is the safest of the kinds of constitution mentioned.And since we\n\t\t\t\t\tare considering what circumstances give rise to party factions and revolutions\n\t\t\t\t\tin constitutions, we must first ascertain their origins and causes generally.\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are, speaking roughly, three in number, which we must first define in outline\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseparately.For we must ascertain\n\t\t\t\t\twhat state of affairs gives rise to party strife, and for what objects it is\n\t\t\t\t\twaged, and thirdly what are the origins of political disorders and internal\n\t\t\t\t\tparty struggles.Now the principal cause, speaking\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally, of the citizens being themselves disposed in a certain manner towards\n\t\t\t\t\trevolution is the one about which we happen to have spoken already. Those that\n\t\t\t\t\tdesire equality enter on party strife if they think that they have too little\n\t\t\t\t\talthough they are the equals of those who have more, while those that desire\n\t\t\t\t\tinequality or superiority do so if they suppose that although they are unequal\n\t\t\t\t\tthey have not got more but an equal amount or less and these desires may be felt justly, and they\n\t\t\t\t\tmay also be felt unjustly; for when inferior, people enter on strife\n\t\t\t\t\tin order that they may be equal, and when equal, in order that they may be\n\t\t\t\t\tgreater. We have therefore said what are the states of feeling in which men\n\t\t\t\t\tengage in party strife.The objects about which it\n\t\t\t\t\tis waged are gain and honor, and their opposites, for men carry on party faction\n\t\t\t\t\tin states in order to avoid dishonor and loss, either on their own behalf or on\n\t\t\t\t\tbehalf of their friends.And the causes and origins of the disturbances which\n\t\t\t\t\toccasion the actual states of feeling described and their direction to the\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects mentioned, according to one account happen to be seven in number, though\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to another they are more. Two of them are the same as those spoken of\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore although not operating in the same way: the motives of gain and honor\n\t\t\t\t\talso stir men up against each other not in order that they may get them for\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, as has been said before, but because they see other men\n\t\t\t\t\tin some cases justly and in other cases unjustly getting a larger share of them.\n\t\t\t\t\tOther causes are insolence, fear, excessive predominance, contempt,\n\t\t\t\t\tdisproportionate growth of power; and also other modes of cause are election intrigue,\n\t\t\t\t\tcarelessness, pettiness, dissimilarity. Among these motives the power possessed by insolence and\n\t\t\t\t\tgain, and their mode of operation, is almost obvious; for when the men in office\n\t\t\t\t\tshow insolence and greed, people rise in revolt against one another and against\n\t\t\t\t\tthe constitutions that afford the opportunity for such conduct; and greed\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes preys on private property and sometimes on common funds. It is clear\n\t\t\t\t\talso what is the power of honor and how it can cause party faction; for men form\n\t\t\t\t\tfactions both when they are themselves dishonored and when they see others\n\t\t\t\t\thonored; and the distribution of honors is unjust when persons are either\n\t\t\t\t\thonored or dishonored against their deserts, just when it is according to\n\t\t\t\t\tdesert. Excessive predominance causes faction, when some individual or body of\n\t\t\t\t\tmen is greater and more powerful than is suitable to the state and the power of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe government; for such are the conditions that usually result in the rise of a\n\t\t\t\t\tmonarchy or dynasty. Owing to this\n\t\t\t\t\tin some places they have the custom of temporary banishment, as at  and ;\n\t\t\t\t\tyet it would be better to provide from the outset that there may be no persons\n\t\t\t\t\tin the stateso greatly predominant,\n\t\t\t\t\tthan first to allow them to come into existence and afterwards to apply a\n\t\t\t\t\tremedy. Fear is the motive of faction with those who have inflicted wrong and\n\t\t\t\t\tare afraid of being punished, and also with those who are in danger of suffering\n\t\t\t\t\ta wrong and wish to act in time before the wrong is inflicted, as the notables\n\t\t\t\t\tat  banded together against the people because of the\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw-suits that were being brought against them. Contempt is a cause of faction and of actual attacks, upon\n\t\t\t\t\tthe government, for instance in oligarchies when those who have no share in the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment are more numerous for they think themselves the stronger\n\t\t\t\t\tparty, and in democracies when the rich have begun to feel contempt\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the disorder and anarchy that prevails, as for example at  the democracy was destroyed owing to\n\t\t\t\t\tbad government after the battle of Oenophyta, and that of the Megarians was\n\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed when they had been defeated owing to disorder and anarchy, and at  before the tyranny of\n\t\t\t\t\tGelo, and at  the common people had fallen into\n\t\t\t\t\tcontempt before the rising against them. Revolutions in the constitutions also take place on\n\t\t\t\t\taccount of disproportionate growth; for just as the body is\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of parts, and needs to grow proportionately in order that its symmetry\n\t\t\t\t\tmay remain, and if it does not it is spoiled, when the foot is four cubits long\n\t\t\t\t\tand the rest of the body two spans, and sometimes it might even change into the\n\t\t\t\t\tshape of another animal if it increased disproportionately not only in size but\n\t\t\t\t\talso in quality, so also a state is composed of parts,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone of which often grows without its being noticed, as for\n\t\t\t\t\texample the number of the poor in democracies and constitutional states.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd sometimes this is also\n\t\t\t\t\tbrought about by accidental occurrences, as for instance at  when a great many notables were\n\t\t\t\t\tdefeated and killed by the Iapygians a short time after the Persian wars a\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional government was changed to a democracy, and at  when those in the seventh tribe had been destroyed by the Spartan Cleomenes the\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens were compelled to admit some of the surrounding people, and at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t when they suffered\n\t\t\t\t\tdisasters by land the notables became fewer because at the time of the war\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst  the army was drawn\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom a muster-roll. And this happens also in\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracies, though to a smaller extent; for when the wealthy become more\n\t\t\t\t\tnumerous or their properties increase, the governments change to oligarchies and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdynasties.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd revolutions in constitutions\n\t\t\t\t\ttake place even without factious strife, owing to election intrigue, as at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t for they made their magistrates\n\t\t\t\t\telected by lot instead of by vote for this reason, because the people used to\n\t\t\t\t\telect those who canvassed; and also owing to carelessness, when people\n\t\t\t\t\tallow men that are not friends of the constitution to enter into the sovereign\n\t\t\t\t\toffices, as at Oreus oligarchy was\n\t\t\t\t\tbroken up when Heracleodorus became one of the magistrates, who in place of an\n\t\t\t\t\t\toligarchyformed a constitutional\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment, or rather a democracy. Another cause is alteration by small stages;\n\t\t\t\t\tby this I mean that often a great change of institutions takes place unnoticed\n\t\t\t\t\twhen people overlook a small alteration, as in  the property-qualification was small, and finally men\n\t\t\t\t\thold office with none at all, as a little is near to nothing, or practically the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame. Also difference of race is a\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of faction, until harmony of spirit is reached; for just as any chance\n\t\t\t\t\tmultitude of people does not form a state, so a state is not formed in any\n\t\t\t\t\tchance period of time. Hence most of the states that have hitherto admitted\n\t\t\t\t\tjoint settlers or additional settlers have split into factions; for example Achaeans\n\t\t\t\t\tsettled at  jointly with\n\t\t\t\t\tTroezenians, and afterwards the Achaeans having become more numerous expelled\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Troezenians, which was the Cause of the curse that fell on the Sybarites;\n\t\t\t\t\tand at Thurii Sybarites quarrelled with those who had settled there with them,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor they claimed to have the larger share in the country as being their own, and\n\t\t\t\t\twere ejected; and at \n\t\t\t\t\tthe additional settlers were discovered plotting against the colonists and were\n\t\t\t\t\texpelled by force of arms; and the people of  after admitting the Chian\n\t\t\t\t\texiles expelled them by arms; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people of  after admitting settlers from  were themselves expelled; and the people\n\t\t\t\t\tof  on the  after bringing in additional\n\t\t\t\t\tsettlers fell into faction; and the Syracusans after the period of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttyrants\n\t\t\t\t\tconferred citizenship on their foreign troops and mercenaries and then faction\n\t\t\t\t\tset in and they came to battle; and the Amphipolitans having received settlers\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom  were most of them\n\t\t\t\t\tdriven out by them.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd in oligarchies civil strife is\n\t\t\t\t\traised by the many, on the ground that they are treated unjustly because they\n\t\t\t\t\tare not admitted to an equal share although they are equal, as has been said\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore, but in democracies it begins with the notables, because they have an\n\t\t\t\t\tequal share although they are not equal.\n\t\t\t\t\tAlso\n\t\t\t\t\tstates sometimes enter on faction for geographical reasons, when the nature of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe country is not suited for there being a single city, as for example at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClazomenae the people near Chytrum are in feud with the inhabitants of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe island, and the Colophonians and the Notians; and\n\t\t\t\t\tat  the population is not\n\t\t\t\t\tuniformly democratic in spirit, but the inhabitants of  are more so than those of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcity. For just as in wars the fording of watercourses, even quite small ones,\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses the formations to lose contact, so every difference seems to cause\n\t\t\t\t\tdivision. Thus perhaps the greatest division is that between virtue and vice,\n\t\t\t\t\tnext that between wealth and poverty, and so with other differences in varying\n\t\t\t\t\tdegree, one of which is the one mentioned.\n\t\t\t\t\tFactions arise therefore not about but out of small matters; but they are\n\t\t\t\t\tcarried on about great matters. And even the small ones grow extremely violent\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they spring up among men of the ruling class,as happened for example at  in ancient times. For the constitution underwent a\n\t\t\t\t\trevolution as a result of a quarrel that arose between two young men, who belonged to the ruling class, about a\n\t\t\t\t\tlove affair. While one of them was abroad the other who was his comrade won over\n\t\t\t\t\tthe youth with whom he was in love, and the former in his anger against him\n\t\t\t\t\tretaliated by persuading his wife to come to him; owing to which they stirred up\n\t\t\t\t\ta party struggle among all the people in the state, enlisting them on their\n\t\t\t\t\tsides. On account of this it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary to guard against such affairs at their beginning, and to break up the\n\t\t\t\t\tfactions of the leaders and powerful men; for the error occurs at the beginning,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the beginning as the proverb says is half of the whole, so that even a small\n\t\t\t\t\tmistake at the beginning stands in the same ratio to mistakes\n\t\t\t\t\tat the other stages. And in general the faction quarrels of the notables involve\n\t\t\t\t\tthe whole state in the consequences, as happened at Hestiaea after the Persian\n\t\t\t\t\twars, when two brothers quarrelled about the division of their patrimony; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe poorer of the two, on the ground that the other would not make a return of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe estate and of the treasure that their father had found, got the common\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople on his side, and the other possessing much property was supported by the\n\t\t\t\t\trich. And at  the beginning of all the factions\n\t\t\t\t\tthat occurred afterwards was when a quarrel arose out of a marriage; the\n\t\t\t\t\tbridegroom interpreted some chance occurrence when he came to fetch the bride as\n\t\t\t\t\ta bad omen and went away without taking her, and her relatives thinking\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves insulted threw some articles of sacred property into the fire when he\n\t\t\t\t\twas performing a sacrifice and then put him to death as guilty of sacrilege. And\n\t\t\t\t\talso at  a faction that arose out\n\t\t\t\t\tof some heiresses was the beginning of many misfortunes, and of the war with the\n\t\t\t\t\tAthenians in which Paches captured the city of : a wealthy citizen named Timophanes left two\n\t\t\t\t\tdaughters, and a man who was rejected in his suit to obtain them for his own\n\t\t\t\t\tsons, Doxander, started the faction and kept on stirring up the Athenians, whose\n\t\t\t\t\tconsul he was at . And among the Phocians when a faction\n\t\t\t\t\tarising out of an heiress sprang up in connection with Mnaseas the father of\n\t\t\t\t\tMnason and Euthykrates the father of Onomarchus, this faction proved to be\n\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning for the Phocians of the Holy War. At Epidamnus also circumstances\n\t\t\t\t\trelating to a marriage gave rise to a revolution in the constitution; somebody had betrothed his daughter, and the father of the\n\t\t\t\t\tman to whom he had betrothed her became a magistrate, and had to sentence him to\n\t\t\t\t\ta fine; the other thinking that he had been treated with insolence formed a\n\t\t\t\t\tparty of the unenfranchised classes to assist him. And also revolutions to oligarchy and democracy and\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional government arise from the growth in reputation or in power of\n\t\t\t\t\tsome magistracy or some section of the state;as for example the Council on the Areopagus having risen in\n\t\t\t\t\treputation during the Persian wars was believed to have made the constitution\n\t\t\t\t\tmore rigid, and then again the naval multitude, having been the cause of the\n\t\t\t\t\tvictory off  and thereby of the\n\t\t\t\t\tleadership of  due to her\n\t\t\t\t\tpower at sea, made the democracy stronger; and at  the notables having risen in repute in connection with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe battle against the Spartans at  took in hand to put down the people; and at  the people having been the cause of the victory in the\n\t\t\t\t\twar against  made a revolution\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom constitutional government to democracy; and at  the people with the aid of the\n\t\t\t\t\tnotables overthrew the tyrant Phoxus and then immediately seized the government; and again at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t similarly the people\n\t\t\t\t\tjoined with the adversaries of the tyrant Periander in expelling him and then\n\t\t\t\t\tbrought the government round to themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd indeed in general it must not\n\t\t\t\t\tescape notice that the persons who have caused a state to win power, whether\n\t\t\t\t\tprivate citizens or magistrates or tribes, or in general a section or group of\n\t\t\t\t\tany kind, stir up faction; for either those who envy these men for being honored\n\t\t\t\t\tbegin the faction, or these men owing to their superiority are not willing to\n\t\t\t\t\tremain in a position of equality. And constitutions also undergo revolution when\n\t\t\t\t\twhat are thought of as opposing sections of the state become equal to one\n\t\t\t\t\tanother, for instance the rich and the people, and there is no middle\n\t\t\t\t\tclass or only an extremely small one; for if either of the two sections becomes\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch the superior, the remainder is not willing to risk an encounter with its\n\t\t\t\t\tmanifestly stronger opponent. Owing to this men who are exceptional in virtue\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally speaking do not cause faction, because they find themselves few\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst many. Universally then in connection with all the forms of constitution\n\t\t\t\t\tthe origins and causes of factions and revolutions are of this nature.The means\n\t\t\t\t\tused to cause revolutions of constitutions are sometimes force and sometimes\n\t\t\t\t\tfraud. Force is employed either when the revolutionary leaders exert compulsion\n\t\t\t\t\timmediately from the start or later onas indeed the mode of using\n\t\t\t\t\tfraud is also twofold: sometimes the revolutionaries after completely deceiving\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people at the first stage alter the constitution with their consent, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthen at a later stage retain their hold on it by force against the people's\n\t\t\t\t\twill: for instance, at the time of the Four Hundred, they deceived the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople by saying that the Persian King would supply money for the war against\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Spartans, and after telling them this falsehood endeavored to keep a hold\n\t\t\t\t\tupon the government; but in other cases they both persuade the people at the\n\t\t\t\t\tstart and afterwards repeat the persuasion and govern them with their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsent.Speaking generally therefore in\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to all the forms of constitution, the causes that have been stated are\n\t\t\t\t\tthose from which revolutions have occurred.But in the light of these\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral rules we must consider the usual course of eventsas classified according to each different kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution. In democracies the principal cause of revolutions is the insolence\n\t\t\t\t\tof the demagogues; for they cause the owners of property to band together,\n\t\t\t\t\tpartly by malicious prosecutions of individuals among them for common\n\t\t\t\t\tfear brings together even the greatest enemies, and partly by setting\n\t\t\t\t\ton the common people against them as a class. And one may see this taking place in this manner in many\n\t\t\t\t\tinstances. In Cos the democracy was overthrown when evil demagogues had arisen there,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the notables banded themselves together; and also in , for the demagogues used to provide pay for public\n\t\t\t\t\tservices, and also to hinder the payment of money owed to the naval captains, and these\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause of the lawsuits that were brought against them were forced to make\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon cause and overthrow the people. And also at  the people were put down\n\t\t\t\t\timmediately after the foundation of the colony because of the people's leaders;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the notables being unjustly treated by them used to be driven out, but later\n\t\t\t\t\ton those who were driven out collecting together effected their return and put\n\t\t\t\t\tdown the people. And also the\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy at  was put down in\n\t\t\t\t\ta similar manner;\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people's leaders in order to have money to distribute to the people went on\n\t\t\t\t\texpelling many of the notables, until they made the exiles a large body, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthese came back and defeated the people in a battle and set up the oligarchy.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd the same thing happened also at Cyme in the time of the democracy\n\t\t\t\t\twhich Thrasymachus put down, and in the case of other states also examination\n\t\t\t\t\twould show that revolutions take place very much in this manner. Sometimes they\n\t\t\t\t\tmake the notables combine by wronging them in order to curry favor, causing\n\t\t\t\t\teither their estates to be divided up or their revenues by imposing public\n\t\t\t\t\tservices, and sometimes by so slandering them that they may have the property of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe wealthy to confiscate. And in\n\t\t\t\t\told times whenever the same man became both leader of the people and general,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey used to change the constitution to a tyranny; for almost the largest number\n\t\t\t\t\tof the tyrants of early days have risen from being leaders of the people. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthe reason why this used to happen then but does not do so now is because then\n\t\t\t\t\tthe leaders of the people were drawn from those who held the office of general\n\t\t\t\t\tfor they were not yet skilled in oratory, but now when\n\t\t\t\t\trhetoric has developed the able speakers are leaders of the people, but owing to\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir inexperience in military matters they are not put in control of these,\n\t\t\t\t\texcept in so far as something of the kind has taken place to a small extent in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome places. And tyrannies also used\n\t\t\t\t\tto occur in former times more than they do now because important offices were\n\t\t\t\t\tentrusted to certain men, as at  a tyranny arose out\n\t\t\t\t\tof the presidency for the president had control of many important\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters. And moreover, because the cities in those times were not\n\t\t\t\t\tlarge but the common people lived on their farmsbusily engaged in agriculture, the people's champions when they\n\t\t\t\t\tbecame warlike used to aim at tyranny. And they all used to do this when they\n\t\t\t\t\thad acquired the confidence of the people, and their pledge of confidence was\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir enmity towards the rich, as at Athens Pisistratus made himself tyrant by\n\t\t\t\t\traising up a party against the men of the plain, and Theagenes at  by slaughtering the cattle of the\n\t\t\t\t\twell-to-do which he captured grazing by the river, and Dionysius\n\t\t\t\t\testablished a claim to become tyrant when he accused Daphnaeus and the rich,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince his hostility to them caused him to be trusted as a true man of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople. And revolutions also take\n\t\t\t\t\tplace from the ancestral form of democracy to one of the most modern kind; for\n\t\t\t\t\twhere the magistracies are elective, but not on property-assessments, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople elect, men ambitious of office by acting as popular leaders bring things\n\t\t\t\t\tto the point of the people's being sovereign even over the laws. A remedy to\n\t\t\t\t\tprevent this or to reduce its extent is for the tribes to elect the magistrates,\n\t\t\t\t\tand not the people collectively.These then are\n\t\t\t\t\tthe causes through which almost all the revolutions in democracies take\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace.Oligarchies undergo revolution principally through two ways\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are the most obvious. One is if they treat the multitude unjustly; for\n\t\t\t\t\tanybody makes an adequate people's champion, and especially so when their leader\n\t\t\t\t\thappens to come from the oligarchy itself, like Lygdamis at , who afterwards actually became tyrant\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Naxians. Faction\n\t\t\t\t\toriginating with other people also has various ways of arising. Sometimes when\n\t\t\t\t\tthe honors of office are shared by very few, dissolution originates from the\n\t\t\t\t\twealthy themselves, but not those that are in office, as for example has\n\t\t\t\t\toccurred at , at , at , and in other states; for those who did not share in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistracies raised disturbances until as a first stage the older brothers were\n\t\t\t\t\tadmitted, and later the younger ones again for in some places a father\n\t\t\t\t\tand a son may not hold office together, and in others an elder and a younger\n\t\t\t\t\tbrother may not. At  the oligarchy became more constitutional, while at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t it ended in becoming\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy, and in  the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment passed from a smaller number to six hundred. At \n\t\t\t\t\talso there was a revolution of the oligarchy caused by a\n\t\t\t\t\tfaction formed by the notables against one another, because few shared in the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment, and the rule stated held, that if a father was a member a son could\n\t\t\t\t\tnot be, nor if there were several brothers could any except the eldest; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon people seized the opportunity of their quarrel and, taking a champion\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom among the notables, fell upon them and conquered them, for a party divided\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst itself is weak. Another case\n\t\t\t\t\twas at Erythrae, where at the time of the oligarchy of the\n\t\t\t\t\tBasilidae in ancient days, althoughthe persons in the government directed affairs well, nevertheless the common\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople were resentful because they were governed by a few, and brought about a\n\t\t\t\t\trevolution of the constitution.On the other hand,\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchies are overthrown from within themselves both when from motives of rivalry they play\n\t\t\t\t\tthe demagogue and this demagogy is of two sorts, one among the\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchs themselves, for a demagogue can arise among them even when they are a\n\t\t\t\t\tvery small body,as for instance in the time of the Thirty at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t, the party of Charicles\n\t\t\t\t\trose to power by currying popularity with the Thirty, and in the time of the\n\t\t\t\t\tFour Hundred the party\n\t\t\t\t\tof Phrynichus rose in the same way,the other when the members of the oligarchy curry\n\t\t\t\t\tpopularity with the mob, as the Civic Guards at  courted popularity with the mob because it elected them, and in\n\t\t\t\t\tall the oligarchies in which the magistracies are not elected by the class from\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the magistrates come but are filled from high property-grades or from\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical clubs while the electors are the heavy-armed soldiers or the common\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople, as used to be the case at , and in places where the jury-courts are not made up\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the governmentfor there members of the\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy by courting popular favor with a view to their trials cause a\n\t\t\t\t\trevolution of the constitution, as took place at  on the Euxine; and a\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther instance is when some men try to narrow down the oligarchy to a smaller\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber, for those who seek equality are forced to bring in the people as a\n\t\t\t\t\thelper. And revolutions in oligarchy also take place when they\n\t\t\t\t\tsquander their private means by riotous living; for also men of this sort seek\n\t\t\t\t\tto bring about a new state of affairs, and either aim at tyranny themselves or\n\t\t\t\t\tsuborn somebody else as Hipparinus put forward Dionysius at , and at  a man named Cleotimus led the\n\t\t\t\t\tadditional settlers that came from  and on their arrival stirred them up to sedition\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst the wealthy, and in  the\n\t\t\t\t\tman who carried out the transactions with Chares attempted to cause a revolution\n\t\t\t\t\tin the constitution for a reason of this sort; so sometimes\n\t\t\t\t\tthey attempt at once to introduce some reform, at other times they rob the\n\t\t\t\t\tpublic funds and in consequence either they or those who fight against them in\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir peculations stir up faction against the government, as happened at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t on the Black Sea.\n\t\t\t\t\tOn the other hand, harmonious oligarchy does not easily cause its own\n\t\t\t\t\tdestruction; and an indication of this is the constitutional government at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t, for there the ruling\n\t\t\t\t\tclass though few are masters of many men because on good\n\t\t\t\t\tterms with one another. Also\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchical governments break up when they create a second oligarchy within the\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy. This is when, although the whole citizen class is small, its few\n\t\t\t\t\tmembers are not all admitted to the greatest offices; this is what once occurred\n\t\t\t\t\tin , for the government being in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe hands of a few, very few men used to become members of the Elders, because\n\t\t\t\t\tthese numbering ninety held office for life, and the mode of election was of a\n\t\t\t\t\tdynastic type and resembled that of the Elders at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.Revolutionsof oligarchies occur both during war and in\n\t\t\t\t\ttime of peace during war since the oligarchs are forced by their\n\t\t\t\t\tdistrust of the people to employ mercenary troops for the man in whose\n\t\t\t\t\thands they place them often becomes tyrant, as Timophanes did at , and\n\t\t\t\t\tif they put several men in command, these win for themselves dynastic\n\t\t\t\t\tpower, and when through fear of this they give a share in the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution to the multitude, the oligarchy falls because they are compelled to\n\t\t\t\t\tmake use of the common people; during peace, on the other hand, because of their\n\t\t\t\t\tdistrust of one another they place their protection in the hands of mercenary\n\t\t\t\t\ttroops and a magistrate between the two parties, who sometimes becomes master of\n\t\t\t\t\tboth, which happened at  in the\n\t\t\t\t\ttime of the government of the Aleuadae led by Simus, and at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t in the time of the political\n\t\t\t\t\tclubs of which that of Iphiades was one. And factions arise also in consequence of one set of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmembers of the oligarchy themselves being pushed aside by another set and being\n\t\t\t\t\tdriven into party strife in regard to marriages or law-suits; examples of such\n\t\t\t\t\tdisorders arising out of a cause related to marriage are the instances spoken of\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore, and also the oligarchy of the knights at  was put down by Diagoras when he had\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen wronged in respect of a marriage, while the faction at  and that at  arose out of a judgement of a\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw-court, when the people at \n\t\t\t\t\tjustly but factiously enforced the punishment against Eurytion on a charge of\n\t\t\t\t\tadultery and those at \n\t\t\t\t\tdid so against Archias; for their personal enemies stirred up party feeling\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst them so as to get them bound in the pillory in the market-place.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlso many governments have been\n\t\t\t\t\tput down by some of their members who had become resentful because the\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchies were too despotic; this is how the oligarchies fell at  and at .\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd revolutions also occur from an accident, both in what is called a\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional government and in those oligarchies in which membership of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcouncil and the law-courts and tenure of the other offices are based on a\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty-qualification. For often the qualification first having been fixed to\n\t\t\t\t\tsuit the circumstances of the time, so that in an oligarchy a few may be members\n\t\t\t\t\tand in a constitutional government the middle classes, when peace or some other\n\t\t\t\t\tgood fortune leads to a good harvest it comes about that the same properties\n\t\t\t\t\tbecome worth many times as large an assessment, so that all the citizens share\n\t\t\t\t\tin all the rights, the change sometimes taking place gradually and little by\n\t\t\t\t\tlittle and not being noticed, but at other times more quickly.Such then\n\t\t\t\t\tare the causes that lead to revolutions and factions in oligarchies\n\t\t\t\t\tand generally, both democracies and oligarchies are sometimes altered\n\t\t\t\t\tnot into the opposite forms of constitution but into ones of the same class, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstancefrom legitimate\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracies and oligarchies into autocratic ones and from the latter into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformer.In aristocracies factions arise in some cases because\n\t\t\t\t\tfew men share in the honors which has also been said to be the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tdisturbances in oligarchies, because an aristocracy too is a sort of oligarchy,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor in both those who govern are fewalthough the reason for this is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot the same in bothsince this does cause it to be thought that\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracy is a form of oligarchy. And this is most bound to come\n\t\t\t\t\tabout when there is a considerable number of people who are proud-spirited on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ground of being equals in virtue for example the clan called the\n\t\t\t\t\tMaidens' Sons at Spartafor they were\n\t\t\t\t\tdescended from the Equalswhom the Spartans detected in a conspiracy\n\t\t\t\t\tand sent away to colonize ; or\n\t\t\t\t\twhen individuals although great men and inferior to nobody in virtue are treated\n\t\t\t\t\tdishonorably by certain men in higher honor for example Lysander by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe kings; or when a person of manly nature has no share in the\n\t\t\t\t\thonors for example Cinadon,\n\t\t\t\t\twho got together the attack upon the Spartans in the reign of\n\t\t\t\t\tAgesilaus. Faction in aristocracies also arises when some of the\n\t\t\t\t\twell-born are too poor and others too rich which happens especially\n\t\t\t\t\tduring wars, and this also occurred at  at the time of the Messenian Waras appears\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the poem of Tyrtaeus entitled; for some\n\t\t\t\t\tmen being in distress because of the war put forward a claim to carry out a\n\t\t\t\t\tre-division of the land of the country. Also if a man is great and\n\t\t\t\t\tcapable of being yet greater, he stirs up faction in order that he may be sole\n\t\t\t\t\truler as Pausanias who commanded the army through the Persian war\n\t\t\t\t\tseems to have done at , and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHanno at .But the actual overthrow of both\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional governments and aristocracies is mostly due to a departure from\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice in the actual framework of the constitution. For what starts it in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase of a constitutional government is that it does not contain a good blend of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy and oligarchy; and in the case of an aristocracy it is the lack of a\n\t\t\t\t\tgood blend of those two elements and of virtue, but chiefly of the two elements\n\t\t\t\t\tI mean popular government and oligarchy, for both\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional governments and most of the constitutions that are called\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracies aim at blending these. For this is the point of distinction between\n\t\t\t\t\taristocracies and what are called constitutional governments, and it is owing to\n\t\t\t\t\tthis that some of them\n\t\t\t\t\tare less and others more stable; for the constitutions inclining more towards\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy men call aristocracies and those inclining more to the side of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmultitude constitutional governments, owing to which those of the latter sort\n\t\t\t\t\tare more secure than the others, for the greater number is the stronger, and\n\t\t\t\t\talso men are more content when they have an equal amount, whereas the owners of\n\t\t\t\t\twealthy properties, if the constitution gives them the superior\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposition,seek to behave\n\t\t\t\t\tinsolently and to gain money. And\n\t\t\t\t\tspeaking broadly, to whichever side the constitution leans, that is the side to\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it shifts as either of the two parties increases its own sidea\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional government shifts to democracy and an aristocracy to oligarchy,\n\t\t\t\t\tor to the opposite extremes, that is, aristocracy to democracy for the\n\t\t\t\t\tpoorer people feeling they are unjustly treated pull it round to the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite and constitutional governments to oligarchy for the\n\t\t\t\t\tonly lasting thing is equality in accordance with desert and the possession of\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is their own. And the\n\t\t\t\t\tchange mentioned\n\t\t\t\t\tcame about at , for because\n\t\t\t\t\tthe property-qualification for honors was too high, the constitution was altered\n\t\t\t\t\tto a lower property-qualification and to a larger number of official posts, but\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the notables illegally bought up the whole of the land for the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution was too oligarchical, so that they were able to grasp at\n\t\t\t\t\twealth . . . And\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people having been trained in the war overpowered the guards, until those\n\t\t\t\t\twho were in the position of having too much land relinquished it.Besides, as\n\t\t\t\t\tall aristocratic constitutions are inclined towards oligarchy, the notables\n\t\t\t\t\tgrasp at wealth for example at  the estates are coming into a few hands; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe notables have more power to do what they like, and to form marriage\n\t\t\t\t\tconnections with whom they like which was the cause of the fall of the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate of , as a result of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmarriage with Dionysius, which would not have\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken place in a democracy; nor in a well-blended aristocracy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd aristocracies are most liable to undergo revolution\n\t\t\t\t\tunobserved, through gradual relaxation, just as it has been said in what has\n\t\t\t\t\tgone before about all forms of constitution in general, that even a small change\n\t\t\t\t\tmay cause a revolution. For when they give up one of the details of the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, afterwards they also make another slightly bigger change more\n\t\t\t\t\treadily, until they alter the whole system. This occurred for instance with the constitution of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t. There was a law that the\n\t\t\t\t\toffice of general could be held at intervals of four years, but some of the\n\t\t\t\t\tyounger men, becoming warlike and winning high repute with the mass of the\n\t\t\t\t\tguards, came to despise the men engaged in affairs, and thought that they would\n\t\t\t\t\teasily get control; so first they tried to repeal the law referred to, so as to\n\t\t\t\t\tenable the same persons to serve as generals continuously, as they saw that the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople would vote for themselves with enthusiasm. And though the magistrates in\n\t\t\t\t\tcharge of this matter, called the Councillors, at first made a movement to\n\t\t\t\t\toppose them, they were won over, believing that after repealing this law they\n\t\t\t\t\twould allow the rest of the constitution to stand; but later, though they wished\n\t\t\t\t\tto prevent them when other laws were being repealed, they could no longer do\n\t\t\t\t\tanything more, but the whole system of the constitution was converted into a\n\t\t\t\t\tdynasty of the men who had initiated the innovations.And constitutions of all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformsare broken up some times\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom movements initiating from within themselves, but sometimes from outside,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen there is an opposite form of constitution either near by or a long way off\n\t\t\t\t\tyet possessed of power. This used to happen in the days of the Athenians and the\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartans; the Athenians used to put down oligarchies everywhere and the Spartans\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemocracies.We have then approximately stated\n\t\t\t\t\tthe causes that give rise to revolutions in the constitutions of states and to\n\t\t\t\t\tparty factions.The next thing to speak about is security both in general and\n\t\t\t\t\tfor each form of constitution separately. First then it is clear that if we know\n\t\t\t\t\tthe causes by which constitutions are destroyed we also know the causes by which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are preserved; for opposites create opposites, and destruction is the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite of security. In well-blended constitutions therefore, if care must be\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken to prevent men from committing any other breach of the law, most of all\n\t\t\t\t\tmust a small breach be guarded against, for transgression of the law creeps in unnoticed, just as\n\t\t\t\t\ta small expenditure occurring often ruins men's estates; for the expense is not\n\t\t\t\t\tnoticed because it does not come all at once, for the mind is led astray by the\n\t\t\t\t\trepeated small outlays, just like the sophistic puzzle, if each is\n\t\t\t\t\tlittle, then all are a little. This is true in one way but in another it is not;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the whole or total is not little, but made up of little parts. One thing\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore that we must guard against is this beginning; and the next point is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat we must not put faith in the arguments strung together for the sake of\n\t\t\t\t\ttricking the multitude, for they are refuted by the facts and\n\t\t\t\t\twhat sort of constitutional sophistries we refer to has been said\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore. And again we must\n\t\t\t\t\tobserve that not only some aristocracies but also some oligarchies endure not\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the constitutions are secure but because those who get in the offices\n\t\t\t\t\ttreat both those outside the constitution and those in the government well, on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe one hand by not treating those who are not members of it unjustly and by\n\t\t\t\t\tbringing their leading men into the constitution and not wronging the ambitious\n\t\t\t\t\tones in the matter of dishonor or the multitude in the matter of gain, and on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other hand, in relation to themselves and those who are members, by treating\n\t\t\t\t\tone another in a democratic spirit. For that equality which men of democratic\n\t\t\t\t\tspirit seek for in the case of the multitude is not only just but also expedient\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of their compeers. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tif there are a greater number in the governing class, many of the legislative\n\t\t\t\t\tenactments of a democratic nature are advantageous, for example for the offices\n\t\t\t\t\tto be tenable for six months, to enable all the compeers to participate in them;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the compeers in this case are as it were the people owing to which\n\t\t\t\t\tdemagogues often arise even among them, as has been said already, and\n\t\t\t\t\talso oligarchies and aristocracies fall into dynasties less for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot so easy to do wrongswhen in\n\t\t\t\t\toffice for a short time as when in for a long time, since it is long tenure of\n\t\t\t\t\toffice that causes tyrannies to spring up in oligarchies and democracies; for\n\t\t\t\t\teither those who are the greatest men in either sort of state aim at tyranny, in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe one sort the demagogues and in the other the dynasts, or those who hold the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatest offices, when they are in office for along time. And constitutions are kept secure not only\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough being at a distance from destroyers but sometimes also through being\n\t\t\t\t\tnear them, for\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they are afraid the citizens keep a closer hold on the government; hence\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who take thought for the constitution must contrive causes of fear, in\n\t\t\t\t\torder that the citizens may keep guard and not relax their vigilance for the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution like a watch in the night, and they must make the distant near.\n\t\t\t\t\tAgain, they must also endeavor to guard against the quarrels and party struggles\n\t\t\t\t\tof the notables by means of legislation, and to keep out those who are outside\n\t\t\t\t\tthe quarrel before they too have taken it over; since to discern a growing evil\n\t\t\t\t\tat the commencement is not any ordinary person's work but needs a statesman.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd to deal with the revolution\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom oligarchy and constitutional government that arises because of the\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty-qualifications, when this occurs while the rates of qualification\n\t\t\t\t\tremain the same but money is becoming plentiful, it is advantageous to examine\n\t\t\t\t\tthe total amount of the rated value of the community as compared with the past\n\t\t\t\t\tamount, in states where the assessment is made yearly, over that period,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand three years or five years ago in the larger states, and if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe new total is many times larger or many times smaller than the former one at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe time when the rates qualifying for citizenship were fixed, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantageous that there should be a law for the magistrates correspondingly to\n\t\t\t\t\ttighten up or to relax the rates, tightening them up in proportion to the ratio\n\t\t\t\t\tof increase if the new total rated value exceeds the old, and relaxing them and\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking the qualification lower if the new total falls below the old. For in oligarchies and constitutional\n\t\t\t\t\tstates, when they do not do this, in the one case the result\n\t\t\t\t\tis that in the latter an oligarchy comes into existence and in the former a\n\t\t\t\t\tdynasty, and in the other case a constitutional government turns into a\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy and an oligarchy into a constitutional government or a government of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people. But it is a policy common to democracy and oligarchy and\n\t\t\t\t\tto monarchy, and every form of constitution not to raise\n\t\t\t\t\tup any man too much beyond due proportion, but rather to try to assign small\n\t\t\t\t\thonors and of long tenure or great ones quickly for officials grow corrupt, and not\n\t\t\t\t\tevery man can bear good fortune, or if not, at all events not to\n\t\t\t\t\tbestow honors in clusters and take them away again in clusters, but by a gradual\n\t\t\t\t\tprocess; and best of all to try so\n\t\t\t\t\tto regulate people by the law that there may be nobody among them specially\n\t\t\t\t\tpre-eminent in power due to friends or wealth, or, failing this, to cause their\n\t\t\t\t\tperiods out of office to be spent abroad.And since men also cause revolutions through their private\n\t\t\t\t\tlives, some magistracy must be set up to inspect those whose mode of living is\n\t\t\t\t\tunsuited to the constitutionunsuited to democracy in a democracy, to\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy in an oligarchy, and similarly for each of the other forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution. And also sectional prosperity in the state must be guarded against\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the same reasons; and the way to avert this is always to entrust business\n\t\t\t\t\tand office to the opposite sections I mean that the respectable are\n\t\t\t\t\topposite to the multitude and the poor to the wealthy, and to endeavor\n\t\t\t\t\teither to mingle together the multitude of the poor and that of the wealthy or\n\t\t\t\t\tto increase the middle class for this dissolves party factions due to\n\t\t\t\t\tinequality. And in every\n\t\t\t\t\tform of constitution it is a very great thing for it to be so framed both by its\n\t\t\t\t\tlaws and by its other institutions that it is impossible for the magistracies to\n\t\t\t\t\tmake a profit. And this has most to be guarded against in oligarchies; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tmany are not so much annoyed at being excluded from holding office but\n\t\t\t\t\tin fact they are glad if somebody lets them have leisure to spend on their own\n\t\t\t\t\taffairs as they are if they think that the magistrates are stealing\n\t\t\t\t\tthe common funds, but then both things annoy them, exclusion from the honors of\n\t\t\t\t\toffice and exclusion from its profits. And indeed the sole way in which a combination of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy and aristocracy is possible is if someone could contrive this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrangement; for it would then be possible\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the notables and also the multitude both to have what they want; for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe democratic principle for all to have the right to hold office and the\n\t\t\t\t\taristocratic one for the offices to be filled by the notables, and this will be\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case when it is impossible to make money from office; for the poor will not\n\t\t\t\t\twant to hold office because of making nothing out of it, but rather to attend to\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir own affairs, while the wealthy will be able to hold office because they\n\t\t\t\t\thave no need to add to their resources from the public funds; so that the result\n\t\t\t\t\twill be that the poor will become well-off through spending their time upon\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir work, and the notables will not be governed by any casual persons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTherefore to prevent peculation\n\t\t\t\t\tof the public property, let the transfer of the funds take place in the presence\n\t\t\t\t\tof all the citizens, and let copies of the lists be deposited for each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrotherhood, company and tribe; and to get men to hold office without\n\t\t\t\t\tprofit there must be honors assigned by law to officials of good repute. And in\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracies it is necessary to be sparing of the wealthy not only by not causing\n\t\t\t\t\tproperties to be divided up, but not incomes either which under some\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions takes place unnoticed, and it is better to prevent men\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom undertaking costly but useless public services like equipping choruses and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttorch-races and all other similar\n\t\t\t\t\tservices, even if they wish to;in an oligarchy on the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand it is necessary to take much care of the poor, and to allot to them the\n\t\t\t\t\toffices of profit, and the penalty if one of the rich commits an outrage against\n\t\t\t\t\tthem must be greater than if it is done by one of themselves, and inheritance must not go\n\t\t\t\t\tby bequest but by family, and the same man must not inherit more than one\n\t\t\t\t\testate, for so estates would be more on a level, and more of the poor would\n\t\t\t\t\testablish themselves as prosperous. And it is expedient both in a democracy and in an oligarchy to assign to those\n\t\t\t\t\twho have a smaller share in the governmentin a democracy to the\n\t\t\t\t\twealthy and in an oligarchy to the pooreither equality or precedence\n\t\t\t\t\tin all other things excepting the supreme offices of state; but these should be\n\t\t\t\t\tentrusted to those prescribed by the constitution exclusively, or to them for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe most part.There are some three qualities which those who are to hold the\n\t\t\t\t\tsupreme magistracies ought to possess, first, loyalty to the established\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, next, very great capacity to do the duties of the office, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthird, virtue and justicein each constitution the sort of justice\n\t\t\t\t\tsuited to the constitution for if the rules of justice are not the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame under all constitutions, it follows that there must be differences in the\n\t\t\t\t\tnature of justice also. It is a difficult question how the choice\n\t\t\t\t\tought to be made when it happens that all these qualities are not found in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame person; for instance, if one man is a good military commander but a bad\n\t\t\t\t\tman and no friend of the constitution, and the other is just and loyal, how\n\t\t\t\t\tshould the choice be made? It seems\n\t\t\t\t\tthat two things ought to be considered, what is the quality of which all men\n\t\t\t\t\thave a larger share, and what the one of which all have a smaller share?\n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore in the case of military command one must consider experience more than\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue, for men have a smaller share of military experience and a larger share\n\t\t\t\t\tof moral goodness; but in the case of a trusteeship or a stewardship the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite, for these require more virtue than most men possess, but the knowledge\n\t\t\t\t\trequired is common to all men. And somebody might raise the question, why is\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue needed if both capacity and loyalty to the constitution are forthcoming,\n\t\t\t\t\tas even these two qualities will do what is suitable? May not the answer be,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause those who possess these two qualities may possibly lack self-control, so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat just as they do not serve themselves well although they know how to and\n\t\t\t\t\talthough they love themselves, so possibly in some cases they may behave in this\n\t\t\t\t\tway in regard to the community also? And broadly, whatever provisions in the laws we describe as advantageous to\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions, these are all preservative of the constitutions, and so is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsupreme elementary principle that has been often stated, that of taking\n\t\t\t\t\tprecautions that the section desirous of the constitution shall be stronger in\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers than the section not desirous off it. And beside all these matters one\n\t\t\t\t\tthing must not be overlooked which at present is overlooked by the,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeviation-forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutionthe middle party;for many of the institutions thought to be popular destroy\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracies, and many of those thought oligarchical destroy oligarchies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the adherents of the\n\t\t\t\t\tdeviation-form, thinking that this form is the only right thing, drag it to\n\t\t\t\t\texcess, not knowing that just as there can be a nose that although deviating\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the most handsome straightness towards being hooked or snub nevertheless is\n\t\t\t\t\tstill beautiful and agreeable to look at, yet all the same, if a sculptor\n\t\t\t\t\tcarries it still further in the direction of excess, he will first lose the\n\t\t\t\t\tsymmetry of the feature and finally will make it not even look like a nose at\n\t\t\t\t\tall, because of its excess and deficiency in the two opposite qualities\n\t\t\t\t\tand the same is the ease also in regard to the other parts of the\n\t\t\t\t\tbody, so this is what happens about constitutions likewise; for it is possible for an oligarchy and a\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy to be satisfactory although they have diverged from the best\n\t\t\t\t\tstructure, but if one strains either of them further, first he will make the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution worse, and finally he will make it not a constitution at all.\n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore the legislator and the statesman must not fail to know what sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocratic institutions save and what destroy a democracy, and what sort of\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchical institutions an oligarchy; for neither constitution can exist and\n\t\t\t\t\tendure without the well-to-do and the multitude, but when an even level of\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty comes about, the constitution resulting must of necessity be another\n\t\t\t\t\tone, so that when men destroy these classes by laws carried to\n\t\t\t\t\texcess they destroy the constitutions. And a mistake is made both in democracies and in\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchiesin democracies by the demagogues, where the multitude is\n\t\t\t\t\tsupreme over the laws; for they always divide the state into two by fighting\n\t\t\t\t\twith the well-to-do, but they ought on the contrary always to pretend to be\n\t\t\t\t\tspeaking on behalf of men that are well-to-do, while in democracies the\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchical statesmen ought to pretend to be speaking on behalf of the people,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the oligarchics ought to take oath in terms exactly opposite to those which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey use now, for at present in some oligarchies they swear, And I\n\t\t\t\t\twill be hostile to the people and will plan whatever evil I can against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthey ought to hold, and to act the part of holding, the opposite notion,\n\t\t\t\t\tdeclaring in their oaths, I will not wrong the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the greatest of all the\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans spoken of to secure the stability of constitutions is one that at present\n\t\t\t\t\tall people despise: it is a system of education suited to the constitutions. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is no use in the most valuable laws, ratified by the unanimous judgement\n\t\t\t\t\tof the whole body of citizens, if these are not trained and educated in the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, popularly if the laws are popular, oligarchically if they are\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchical; for there is such a thing as want of self-discipline in a state,\n\t\t\t\t\tas well as in an individual.But to\n\t\t\t\t\thave been educatedto suit the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution does not mean to do the things that give pleasure to the adherents\n\t\t\t\t\tof oligarchy or to the supporters of democracy, but the things that will enable\n\t\t\t\t\tthe former to govern oligarchically and the latter to govern themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocratically. But at present in the oligarchies the sons of the rulers are\n\t\t\t\t\tluxurious, and the sons of the badly-off become trained by exercise and labor,\n\t\t\t\t\tso that they are both more desirous of reform and more able to bring it about;\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile in the democracies\n\t\t\t\t\tthought to be the most democratic the opposite of what is expedient has come\n\t\t\t\t\tabout. And the cause of this is that they define liberty wrongly for\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are two things that are thought to be defining features of democracy, the\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereignty of the majority and liberty; for justice is supposed to be\n\t\t\t\t\tequality, and equality the sovereignty of what ever may have been decided by the\n\t\t\t\t\tmultitude, and liberty doing just what one likes. Hence in democracies of this\n\t\t\t\t\tsort everybody lives as he likes, and unto what end he\n\t\t\t\t\tlisteth, as Euripides says. But this is bad; for to live in\n\t\t\t\t\tconformity with the constitution ought not to be considered slavery but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsafety.This therefore, speaking broadly, is a\n\t\t\t\t\tlist of the things that cause the alteration and the destruction of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions, and of those that cause their security and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinuance.It remains to speak of monarchy, the causes\n\t\t\t\t\tthat destroy it and the natural means of its preservation. And the things\n\t\t\t\t\tthat happen about royal governments and tyrannies are almost similar to those\n\t\t\t\t\tthat have been narrated about constitutional governments. For royal government\n\t\t\t\t\tcorresponds with aristocracy, while tyranny is a combination of the last form of\n\t\t\t\t\t\toligarchy\n\t\t\t\t\tand of democracy; and for that very reason it is most harmful to its subjects,\n\t\t\t\t\tinasmuch as it is a combination of two bad things, and is liable to the\n\t\t\t\t\tdeviations and errors that spring from both forms of constitution. And these two different sorts of monarchy\n\t\t\t\t\thave their origins from directly opposite sources; royalty has come into\n\t\t\t\t\texistence for the assistance of the distinguished against the people, and a king\n\t\t\t\t\tis appointed from those distinguished by superiority in virtue or the actions\n\t\t\t\t\tthat spring from virtue, or by superiority in coming from a family of that\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter, while a tyrant is set up from among the people and the multitude to\n\t\t\t\t\toppose the notables, in order that the people may suffer no injustice from them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd this is manifest from the\n\t\t\t\t\tfacts of history. For almost the greatest number of tyrants have risen, it may\n\t\t\t\t\tbe said, from being demagogues, having won the people's confidence by slandering\n\t\t\t\t\tthe notables. For some tyrannies were set up in this manner when the states had\n\t\t\t\t\talready grown great, but others that came before them arose from kings departing\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the ancestral customs and aiming at a more despotic rule,and others from the men elected to fill the supreme\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistracies for in old times the peoples used to appoint the popular\n\t\t\t\t\t\tofficials and the sacred embassies for long terms of office, and others from\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchies electing some one supreme official for the greatest magistracies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor in all these methods they\n\t\t\t\t\thad it in their power to effect their purpose easily, if only they wished,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they already possessed the power of royal rule in the one set of cases\n\t\t\t\t\tand of their honorable office in the other, for example Phidon in  and others became\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrants when they possessed royal power already, while the Ionian tyrants and Phalaris arose from offices of honor, and\n\t\t\t\t\tPanaetius at Leontini and Cypselus at  and Pisistratus at  and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDionysius at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t and others in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame manner from the position of demagogue. Therefore, as we said, royalty is ranged in correspondence\n\t\t\t\t\twith aristocracy, for it goes by merit, either by private virtue or by family or\n\t\t\t\t\tby services or by a combination of these things and ability. For in every\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance this honor fell to men after they had conferred benefit or because they\n\t\t\t\t\thad the ability to confer benefit on their cities or their nations, some having\n\t\t\t\t\tprevented their enslavement in war, for instance Codrus, others having set them free, for instance Cyrus, or having settled or acquired territory, for instance the kings\n\t\t\t\t\tof  and  and the Molossians.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd a king wishes to be a guardian,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto protect the owners of estates from suffering injustice and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people from suffering insult, but tyranny, as has repeatedly been said, pays\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to no common interest unless for the sake of its private benefit; and the\n\t\t\t\t\taim of tyranny is what is pleasant, that of royalty what is noble. Hence even in\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir requisitions money is the aim of tyrants but rather marks of honor that of\n\t\t\t\t\tkings; and a king's body-guard consists of citizens, a tyrant's of foreign\n\t\t\t\t\tmercenaries. And it is manifest that\n\t\t\t\t\ttyranny has the evils of both democracy and oligarchy; it copies oligarchy in\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking wealth its object for inevitably that is the only way in which\n\t\t\t\t\tthe tyrant's body-guard and his luxury can be kept up and in putting\n\t\t\t\t\tno trust in the multitude which is why they resort to the measure of\n\t\t\t\t\tstripping the people of arms, and why ill-treatment of the mob and its expulsion\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the city and settlement in scattered places is common to both forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment, both oligarchy and tyranny, while it copies democracy in\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking war on the notables and destroying them secretly and openly and banishing\n\t\t\t\t\tthem as plotting against it and obstructive to its rule. For it is from them\n\t\t\t\t\tthat counter-movements actually spring, some of them wishing themselves to rule,\n\t\t\t\t\tand others notto be slaves. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tcomes the advice of Periander to Thrasybulus, his docking of the prominent cornstalks, meaning\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the prominent citizens must always be made away with.Therefore, as was\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtually stated, the causes of revolutions in\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional and in royal governments must be deemed to be the same; for\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects in many cases attack monarchies because of unjust treatment and fear\n\t\t\t\t\tand contempt, and among the forms of unjust treatment most of all because of\n\t\t\t\t\tinsolence, and sometimes the cause is the seizure of private property. Also the\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects aimed at by the revolutionaries in the case both of tyrannies and of\n\t\t\t\t\troyal governments are the same as in revolts against constitutional government;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor monarchs possess great wealth and great honor, which are desired by all men.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd in some cases the attack is\n\t\t\t\t\taimed at the person of the rulers, in others at their office. Risings provoked\n\t\t\t\t\tby insolence are aimed against the person; and though insolence has many\n\t\t\t\t\tvarieties, each of them gives rise to anger, and when men are angry they mostly\n\t\t\t\t\tattack for the sake of revenge, not of ambition. For example the attack on the\n\t\t\t\t\tPisistratidae took place because they outraged Harmodius's sister and treated\n\t\t\t\t\tHarmodius with contumely for Harmodius attacked them because of his\n\t\t\t\t\tsister and Aristogiton because of Harmodius, and also the plot was laid against\n\t\t\t\t\tPeriander the tyrant in  because when drinking with his favorite he asked him\n\t\t\t\t\tif he was yet with child by him,and the attack on Philip by Pausanias was because he allowed him to be insulted by Attalus and\n\t\t\t\t\this friends, and that on Amyntas the Little by Derdas\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause he mocked at his youth, and the attack of the eunuch on Evagoras of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t was for revenge, for he\n\t\t\t\t\tmurdered him as being insulted, because Evagoras's son had taken away his wife.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd many risings have also\n\t\t\t\t\toccurred because of shameful personal indignities committed by certain monarchs.\n\t\t\t\t\tOne instance is the attack of Crataeas on Archelaus; for he was always\n\t\t\t\t\tresentful of the association, so that even a smaller excuse became sufficient,\n\t\t\t\t\tor perhaps it was because he did not give him the hand of one of his daughters\n\t\t\t\t\tafter agreeing to do so, but gave the elder to the king of Elimea when hard\n\t\t\t\t\tpressed in a war against Sirras and Arrabaeus, and the younger to his son\n\t\t\t\t\tAmyntas, thinking that thus Amyntas would be least likely to quarrel with his\n\t\t\t\t\tson by Cleopatra; but at all events Crataeas's estrangement was primarily caused\n\t\t\t\t\tby resentment because of the love affair. And Hellanocrates of  also joined in the attack for the same reason; for\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause while enjoying his favors Archelaus would not restore him to his home\n\t\t\t\t\talthough he had promised to do so, he thought that the motive of the familiarity\n\t\t\t\t\tthat had taken placehad been\n\t\t\t\t\tinsolence and not passionate desire. And  and Heraclides of  made away with Cotys to avenge\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir father, and Adamas revolted from Cotys because he had been mutilated by\n\t\t\t\t\thim when a boy, on the ground of the insult. And also many men when enraged by the indignity of\n\t\t\t\t\tcorporal chastisement have avenged the insult by destroying or attempting to\n\t\t\t\t\tdestroy its author, even when a magistrate or member of a royal dynasty. For\n\t\t\t\t\texample when the Penthilidae at  went about striking people with their staves Megacles\n\t\t\t\t\twith his friends set on them and made away with them, and afterwards Smerdis\n\t\t\t\t\twhen he had been beaten and dragged out from his wife's presence killed\n\t\t\t\t\tPenthilus. Also Decamnichus took a leading part in the attack upon Archelaus,\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing the first to stir on the attackers; and the cause of his anger was that he\n\t\t\t\t\thad handed him over to Euripides the poet to flog, Euripides being angry because\n\t\t\t\t\the had made a remark about his breath smelling. And many others also for similar reasons have been made\n\t\t\t\t\taway with or plotted against. And similarly also from the motive of fear; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthis was one of the causes we mentioned in the case of monarchies, as also in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of constitutional governments; for instance Artapanes killed Xerxes fearing\n\t\t\t\t\tthe charge about Darius, because he had hanged him when Xerxes had ordered him\n\t\t\t\t\tnot to but he had thought that he would forgive him because he would forget, as\n\t\t\t\t\the had been at dinner. And other attacks on monarchs have been on account of\n\t\t\t\t\tcontempt, as somebody killed Sardanapallus when he saw him combing\n\t\t\t\t\this hair with his women if this story told by the narrators of legends\n\t\t\t\t\tis trueand if it did not happen with Sardanapallus, it might quite\n\t\t\t\t\twell be true of somebody else, and  attacked the younger Dionysius because he despised\n\t\t\t\t\thim, when he saw the citizens despising him and the king himself always drunk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd contempt has led some even\n\t\t\t\t\tof the friends of monarchs to attack them, for they despise them for trusting\n\t\t\t\t\tthem and think they will not be found out. And contempt is in a manner the\n\t\t\t\t\tmotive of those who attack monarchs thinking that they are able to seize the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment; for they make the attempt with a light heart, feeling that they have\n\t\t\t\t\tthe power and because of their power despising the danger, as generals\n\t\t\t\t\tcommanding the armies attack their monarchs; for instance Cyrus attacked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAstyages when he\n\t\t\t\t\tdespised both his mode of life and his power, because his power had waned and he\n\t\t\t\t\thimself was living luxuriously, and the Thracian Seuthes attacked Amadocus when his general. Others again attack monarchs for more than\n\t\t\t\t\tone of these motives, for instance both because they despise them and for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsake of gain, as Mithridates attacked Ariobarzanes. And it is men of bold nature\n\t\t\t\t\tand who hold a military office with monarchs who most often make the attempt for\n\t\t\t\t\tthis reason; for courage possessing power is boldness,and they make their attacks thinking that with\n\t\t\t\t\tcourage and power they will easily prevail. But with those whose attack is prompted by ambition the\n\t\t\t\t\tmotive operates in a different way from those spoken of before; some men attack\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrants because they see great profits and great honors belonging to them, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is not the reason that in each case leads the persons who attack from\n\t\t\t\t\tmotives of ambition to resolve on the venture; those others are led by the\n\t\t\t\t\tmotive stated, but these attack monarchs from a wish to gain not monarchy but\n\t\t\t\t\tglory, just as they would wish to take part in doing any other uncommon deed\n\t\t\t\t\tthat makes men famous and known to their fellows. Not but what those who make the venture from this motive\n\t\t\t\t\tare very few indeed in number, for underlying it there must be an utter\n\t\t\t\t\tdisregard of safety, if regard for safety is not to check the enterprise; they\n\t\t\t\t\tmust always have present in their minds the opinion of , although it is not easy for many men to\n\t\t\t\t\thave it;  marched with a small\n\t\t\t\t\tforce against Dionysius, saying that his feeling was that, whatever point he\n\t\t\t\t\tmight be able to get to, it would be enough for him to have had that much share\n\t\t\t\t\tin the enterprisefor instance, if it should befall him to die as soon\n\t\t\t\t\tas he had just set foot in the country, that death would satisfy him.And one way\n\t\t\t\t\tin which tyranny is destroyed, as is each of the other forms of constitution\n\t\t\t\t\talso, is from without, if some state with an opposite constitution is\n\t\t\t\t\tstronger for the wish to destroy it will clearly be present in such a\n\t\t\t\t\tneighbor because of the opposition of principle, and all men do what they wish\n\t\t\t\t\tif they have the powerand the constitutions opposed to\n\t\t\t\t\ttyranny are, on the one hand democracy, which is opposed to it as in\n\t\t\t\t\tHesiod's phrase potter to potter,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the final form of democracy is tyranny, and on the other hand royalty\n\t\t\t\t\tand aristocracy are opposed to tyranny because of the opposite nature of their\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutional structure owing to which the Spartans put down a very\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat many tyrannies, and so did the Syracusans at the period when they were\n\t\t\t\t\tgoverned well. But one\n\t\t\t\t\tway is from within itself, when the partners in it fall into discord, as the\n\t\t\t\t\ttyranny of the family of Gelo\n\t\t\t\t\twas destroyed, and in modern times that of the family of DionysiusGelo's, when Thrasybulus the\n\t\t\t\t\tbrother of Hiero paid court to the son of Gelo and urged him into indulgences in\n\t\t\t\t\torder that he himself might rule, and the son's connections banded together a\n\t\t\t\t\tbody of confederates in order that the tyranny might not be put down entirely\n\t\t\t\t\tbut only Thrasybulus, but their confederates seizing the opportunity expelled\n\t\t\t\t\tthem all; Dionysius was put down by , his relative, who got the people on to his side and\n\t\t\t\t\texpelled him, but was afterwards killed. There are two causes that chiefly lead men to attack\n\t\t\t\t\ttyranny, hatred and contempt; the former, hatred,attaches to tyrants always, but it is their being despised that\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses their downfall in many cases. A proof of this is that most of those that\n\t\t\t\t\thave won tyrannies have also kept their offices to the end, but those that have\n\t\t\t\t\tinherited them almost all lose them at once; for they live a life of indulgence,\n\t\t\t\t\tand so become despicable and also give many opportunities to their attackers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd also anger must be counted\n\t\t\t\t\tas an element in the hatred felt for them, for in a way it occasions the same\n\t\t\t\t\tactions. And often it is even more active than hatred, since angry men attack\n\t\t\t\t\tmore vigorously because passion does not employ calculation and\n\t\t\t\t\tinsolence most frequently causes men to be led by their angry tempers, which was\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cause of the fall of the tyranny of the Pisistratidae and many\n\t\t\t\t\tothers, but hatred calculates more; for anger brings with it an\n\t\t\t\t\telement of pain, making calculation difficult, but enmity is not accompanied by\n\t\t\t\t\tpain. And to speak summarily, all the things that we have mentioned as causing\n\t\t\t\t\tthe down fall of unmixed and extreme oligarchy and of the last form of democracy\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be counted as destructive of tyranny as well, since extreme oligarchy and\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy are in reality divided\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrannies. Royal government on the\n\t\t\t\t\tother hand is very seldom destroyed by external causes, so that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tlong-lasting; but in most cases its destruction arises out of itself. And it is\n\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed in two ways, one when those who participate in it quarrel, and\n\t\t\t\t\tanother when the kings try to administer the government too tyrannically,\n\t\t\t\t\tclaiming to exercise sovereignty in more things and contrary to the law. Royal\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernments do not occur any more now, but if ever monarchies do occur they are\n\t\t\t\t\trather tyrannies, because royalty is government over willing subjects but with\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereignty over greater matters, but men of equal quality are numerous and no\n\t\t\t\t\tone is so outstanding as to fit the magnitude and dignity of the office; so that\n\t\t\t\t\tfor this reason the subjects do not submit willingly, and if a man has made\n\t\t\t\t\thimself ruler by deception or force, then this is thought to be a tyranny.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn cases of hereditary royalty\n\t\t\t\t\twe must also set down a cause of their destruction, in addition to those\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned, the fact that hereditary kings often become despicable, and that\n\t\t\t\t\talthough possessing not the power of a tyrant but the dignity of a king they\n\t\t\t\t\tcommit insolent outrages; for the deposition of kings used to be easy, since a\n\t\t\t\t\tking will at once cease to be king if his subjects do not wish him to be,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas a tyrant will still be tyrant even though his subjects do not wish\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit.These causes then and others of the same\n\t\t\t\t\tnature are those that bring about the destruction of monarchies.On the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand it is clear that monarchies, speaking generally, are preserved in safety as\n\t\t\t\t\ta result of the opposite causes to those by which they are destroyed. But taking\n\t\t\t\t\tthe different sorts of monarchy separatelyroyalties are preserved by\n\t\t\t\t\tbringing theminto a more moderate\n\t\t\t\t\tform; for the fewer powers the kings have, the longer time the office in its\n\t\t\t\t\tentirety must last, for they themselves become less despotic and more equal to\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir subjects in temper, and their subjects envy them less. For this was the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of the long persistence of the Molossian royalty, and that of  has continued because the office was\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the beginning divided into two halves, and because it was again limited in\n\t\t\t\t\tvarious ways by Theopompus, in particular by\n\t\t\t\t\this instituting the office of the ephors to keep a check upon it; for by taking\n\t\t\t\t\taway some of the kings' power he increased the permanence of the royal office,\n\t\t\t\t\tso that in a manner he did not make it less but greater. This indeed as the\n\t\t\t\t\tstory goes is what he said in reply to his wife, when she asked if he felt no\n\t\t\t\t\tshame in bequeathing the royal power to his sons smaller than he had inherited\n\t\t\t\t\tit from his father: Indeed I do not, he is said to have\n\t\t\t\t\tanswered, for I hand it on more lasting.Tyrannies on the\n\t\t\t\t\tother hand are preserved in two extremely opposite ways. One of these is the\n\t\t\t\t\ttraditional way and the one in which most tyrants administer their office. Most\n\t\t\t\t\tof these ordinary safeguards of tyranny are said to have been instituted by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPeriander of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t, and also many such\n\t\t\t\t\tdevices may be borrowed from the Persian empire. These are both the measures\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned some time back to secure the safety of a tyranny as far as\n\t\t\t\t\tpossiblethe lopping off of outstanding men and the destruction of the\n\t\t\t\t\tproud,and also the prohibition of common meals and club-fellowship\n\t\t\t\t\tand education and all other things of this nature, in fact the close\n\t\t\t\t\twatch upon all things that usually engender the two emotions of pride and\n\t\t\t\t\tconfidence, and the prevention of the formation of study-circles and other\n\t\t\t\t\tconferences for debate, and the employment of every means that will\n\t\t\t\t\tmake people as much as possible unknown to one another for familiarity\n\t\t\t\t\tincreases mutual confidence; and for the people in the city to be always visible and to\n\t\t\t\t\thang about the palace-gates for thus there would be least concealment\n\t\t\t\t\tabout what they are doing, and they would get into a habit of being humble from\n\t\t\t\t\talways acting in a servile way; and all the other similar devices of\n\t\t\t\t\tPersian and barbarian tyranny for all have the same effect;\n\t\t\t\t\tand to try not to be uninformed about any chance utterances or actions of any of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subjects, but to have spies like the women called\n\t\t\t\t\tprovocatrices at  and the sharp-ears that used to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe sent out by Hiero wherever there was any gathering or conference\n\t\t\t\t\tfor when men are afraid of spies of this sort they keep a check on\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir tongues, and if they do speak freely are less likely not to be found\n\t\t\t\t\tout; and to set men at\n\t\t\t\t\tvariance with one another and cause quarrels between friend and friend and\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween the people and the notables and among the rich. And it is a device of\n\t\t\t\t\ttyranny to make the subjects poor, so that a guardmay not be kept, and also that the people\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing busy with their daily affairs may not have leisure to plot against their\n\t\t\t\t\truler. Instances of this are the pyramids in  and the votive offerings of the Cypselids, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe building of the temple of Olympian Zeus by the Pisistratidae and of the temples at , works of Polycrates for all these\n\t\t\t\t\tundertakings produce the same effect, constant occupation and poverty among the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject people; and the\n\t\t\t\t\tlevying of taxes, as at \n\t\t\t\t\tfor in the reign of Dionysius the result of taxation used to be that in five years men\n\t\t\t\t\thad contributed the whole of their substance. Also the tyrant is a\n\t\t\t\t\tstirrer-up of war, with the deliberate purpose of keeping the people busy and\n\t\t\t\t\talso of making them constantly in need of a leader. Also whereas friends are a\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans of security to royalty, it is a mark of a tyrant to be extremely\n\t\t\t\t\tdistrustful of his friends, on the ground that, while all have the wish, these\n\t\t\t\t\tchiefly have the power. Also the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings that occur in connection with the final form of democracy are all favorable to\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrannydominance of women in the homes, in order that they may carry\n\t\t\t\t\tabroad reports against the men, and lack of discipline among the slaves, for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame reason; for slaves and women do not plot against tyrants, and also, if they\n\t\t\t\t\tprosper under tyrannies, must feel well-disposed to them, and to democracies as\n\t\t\t\t\twell for the common people also wishes to be sole ruler.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence also the flatterer is in honor with bothwith democracies the\n\t\t\t\t\tdemagogue for the demagogue is a flatterer of the people,\n\t\t\t\t\tand with the tyrants those who associate with them humbly, which is the task of\n\t\t\t\t\tflattery. In fact owing to this tyranny is a friend of the base; for\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrants enjoy being flattered, but nobody would ever flatter them if he\n\t\t\t\t\tpossessed a free spiritmen of character love their ruler, or at all\n\t\t\t\t\tevents do not flatter him. And the base are useful for base business, for nail\n\t\t\t\t\tis driven out by nail, as the proverb goes.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd it is a mark of a tyrant to\n\t\t\t\t\tdislike anyone that is proud or free-spirited; for the tyrant claims for himself\n\t\t\t\t\talone the right to bear that character, and the man who meets his pride with\n\t\t\t\t\tpride and shows a free spirit robs tyranny of its superiority and position of\n\t\t\t\t\tmastery; tyrants therefore hate the proud as undermining their authority. And it\n\t\t\t\t\tis a mark of a tyrant to have men of foreign extraction rather than citizens as\n\t\t\t\t\tguests at table and companions, feeling that citizens are hostile but strangers\n\t\t\t\t\tmake no claim against him. These and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar habits are characteristic of tyrants and preservative of their office,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut they lack no element of baseness. And broadly speaking, they are all included under three heads; for tyranny\n\t\t\t\t\taims at three things, one to keep its subjects humble for a\n\t\t\t\t\thumble-spirited man would not plot against anybody, second to have\n\t\t\t\t\tthem continually distrust one another for a tyranny is not destroyed\n\t\t\t\t\tuntil some men come to trust each other, owing to which tyrants also make war on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe respectable, as detrimentalto\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir rule not only because of their refusal to submit to despotic rule, but\n\t\t\t\t\talso because they are faithful to one another and to the other citizens, and do\n\t\t\t\t\tnot inform against one another nor against the others; and the third\n\t\t\t\t\tis lack of power for political action since nobody attempts\n\t\t\t\t\timpossibilities, so that nobody tries to put down a tyranny if he has not power\n\t\t\t\t\tbehind him. These then in\n\t\t\t\t\tfact are the three aims to which the wishes of tyrants are directed; for all the\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasures taken by tyrants one might class under these principlessome\n\t\t\t\t\tare designed to prevent mutual confidence among the subjects, others to curtail\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir power, and others to make them humble-spirited.Such then is the nature of\n\t\t\t\t\tone method by which security is obtained for tyrannies. The other tries to\n\t\t\t\t\toperate in a manner almost the opposite of the devices mentioned. And it can be\n\t\t\t\t\tascertained from considering the downfall of royal governments. For just as one\n\t\t\t\t\tmode of destroying royalty is to make its government more tyrannical, so a mode\n\t\t\t\t\tof securing tyranny is to make it more regal, protecting one thing only, its\n\t\t\t\t\tpower, in order that the ruler may govern not only with the consent of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects but even without it; for if he gives up this, he also gives up his\n\t\t\t\t\tposition as tyrant. But while this must stand as a fundamental principle, all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other measures he may either adopt or pretend to adopt by cleverly acting\n\t\t\t\t\tthe royal part. The first step is\n\t\t\t\t\tto be careful of the public funds, not squandering presents such as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe multitudes resent, when tyrants take money from the people themselves while\n\t\t\t\t\tthey toil and labor in penury and lavish it on mistresses and foreigners and\n\t\t\t\t\tcraftsmen, and also rendering account of receipts and expenditure, as some\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrants have done already for this careful management would make a\n\t\t\t\t\truler seem a steward of the state and not a tyrant, and he need not be afraid of\n\t\t\t\t\tever being at a loss for funds while he is master of the state; on the contrary, for those tyrants who go\n\t\t\t\t\tabroad on foreign campaigns this is actually more expedient than to leave their\n\t\t\t\t\tmoney there collected into one sum, for there is less fear of those guarding it\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking an attempt on power; since for tyrants campaigning abroad the keepers of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe treasury are more to be feared than the citizens, for the citizens go abroad\n\t\t\t\t\twith him but the others stay at home. Secondly he must be seen to\n\t\t\t\t\tcollect his taxes and benevolences for purposes of administration and to meet\n\t\t\t\t\this occasional requirements for military emergencies, and generally must pose as\n\t\t\t\t\tguardian and steward as it were of a public fund and not a private estate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd his bearing must not be\n\t\t\t\t\tharsh but dignified, and also such as to inspire not fear but rather\n\t\t\t\t\t\trespectin those who encounter\n\t\t\t\t\thim, though this is not easy to achieve if he is a contemptible personality; so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat even if he neglects the other virtues he is bound to cultivate military\n\t\t\t\t\tvalor, and to make himself a reputation as a soldier. And further more not only\n\t\t\t\t\tmust he himself be known not to outrage any of his subjects, either boy or girl,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut so also must everybody about him, and also their wives must similarly show\n\t\t\t\t\trespect towards the other women, since even the insolences of women have caused\n\t\t\t\t\tthe fall of many tyrannies. And in\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to bodily enjoyments he must do the opposite of what some tyrants do now\n\t\t\t\t\tfor they not only begin their debaucheries at daybreak and carry them\n\t\t\t\t\ton for many days at a time, but also wish to be seen doing so by the public, in\n\t\t\t\t\torder that people may admire them as fortunate and happy, but best of\n\t\t\t\t\tall he must be moderate in such matters, or if not, he must at all events avoid\n\t\t\t\t\tdisplaying his indulgences to his fellows for not the sober man but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe drunkard is easy to attack and to despise, not the wakeful man but the\n\t\t\t\t\tsleeper. And he must do\n\t\t\t\t\tthe opposite of almost all the things mentioned some time back, for he must lay\n\t\t\t\t\tout and adorn the city as if he were a trustee and not a tyrant. And further he\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be seen always to be exceptionally zealous as regards religious observances\n\t\t\t\t\tfor people are less afraid of suffering any illegal treatment from men\n\t\t\t\t\tof this sort, if they think that their ruler has religious scruples and pays\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to the gods, and also they plot against him less, thinking that he has\n\t\t\t\t\teven the gods as allies, though he should not display a foolish\n\t\t\t\t\treligiosity. And he must pay such\n\t\t\t\t\thonor to those who display merit in any matter that they may think that they\n\t\t\t\t\tcould never be more honored by the citizens if they were in dependent; and\n\t\t\t\t\thonors of this kind he should bestow in person, but inflict his punishments by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe agency of other magistrates and law-courts. And it is a protection common to\n\t\t\t\t\tevery sort of monarchy to make no one man great, but if necessary to exalt\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral for they will keep watch on one another, and if\n\t\t\t\t\tafter all the ruler has to elevate an individual, at all events not take a man\n\t\t\t\t\tof bold spirit for such a character is most enterprising in all\n\t\t\t\t\tundertakings; and if he thinks fit to remove somebody from his power,\n\t\t\t\t\tto do this by gradual stages and not take away the whole of his authority at\n\t\t\t\t\tonce. And again he should carefully\n\t\t\t\t\tavoid all forms of outrage, and two beyond all, violent bodily punishments and\n\t\t\t\t\toutrage of the young. And this caution must especially be exercised in relation\n\t\t\t\t\tto the ambitious, for while to be slighted in regard to property annoys the\n\t\t\t\t\tlovers of wealth, slights that involve dishonor are what men of honorable\n\t\t\t\t\tambition and high character resent.Hence the tyrant should either not consort with men of this kind, or appear to\n\t\t\t\t\tinflict his punishments paternally and not because of contempt, and to indulge\n\t\t\t\t\tin the society of the young for reasons of passion, not because he has the\n\t\t\t\t\tpower, and in general he should buy off what are thought to be dishonors by\n\t\t\t\t\tgreater honors. And among those who\n\t\t\t\t\tmake attempts upon the life of a ruler the most formidable and those against\n\t\t\t\t\twhom the greatest precaution is needed are those that are ready to sacrifice\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir lives if they can destroy him. Hence the greatest care must be taken to\n\t\t\t\t\tguard against those who think that insolent outrage is being done either to\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves or to those who happen to be under their care; for men attacking\n\t\t\t\t\tunder the influence of anger are reckless of themselves, as Heraclitus also observed when he said that anger\n\t\t\t\t\twas hard to combat because it would buy revenge with a life. And since states consist of two parts, the poor\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople and the rich, the most important thing is for both to think that they owe\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir safety to the government and for it to prevent either from being wronged\n\t\t\t\t\tby the other, but whichever class is the stronger, this must be made to be\n\t\t\t\t\tentirely on the side of the government, as, if this support for the tyrant's\n\t\t\t\t\tinterests is secured, there is no need for him to institute a liberation of\n\t\t\t\t\tslaves or a disarming of the citizens, for one of the two parts of the state\n\t\t\t\t\tadded to his power will be enough to make him and them stronger than their\n\t\t\t\t\tattackers. But to discuss each of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch matters separately is superfluous; for the thing to aim at is clear,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it is necessary to appear to the subjects to be not a\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrannical ruler but a steward and a royal governor, and not an appropriator of\n\t\t\t\t\twealth but a trustee, and to pursue the moderate things of life and not its\n\t\t\t\t\textravagances, and also to make the notables one's comrades and the many one's\n\t\t\t\t\tfollowers. For the result of these methods must be that not only the tyrant's\n\t\t\t\t\trule will be more honorable and more enviable because he will rule nobler\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects and not men that have been humiliated, and will not be continually\n\t\t\t\t\thated and feared, but also that his rule will endure longer, and moreover that\n\t\t\t\t\the himself in his personal character will be nobly disposed towards virtue, or\n\t\t\t\t\tat all events half-virtuous, and not base but only half-base.Nevertheless\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy and tyranny are less lasting than any of the constitutional governments.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the longest-lived was the tyranny at , that of the sons of Orthagoras and of\n\t\t\t\t\tOrthagoras himself, and this lasted a hundred years. The cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis was that they treated their subjects moderately and in many matters were\n\t\t\t\t\tsubservient to the laws, and Cleisthenes because he was a warlike man was not\n\t\t\t\t\teasily despised, and in most things they kept the lead of the people by looking\n\t\t\t\t\tafter their interests. At all events it is said that Cleisthenes placed a wreath\n\t\t\t\t\ton the judge who awarded the victory away from him, and some say that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstatueof a seated figure in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmarket-place is a statue of the man who gave this judgement. And they say that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPisistratus also\n\t\t\t\t\tonce submitted to a summons for trial before the Areopagus. And the second longest is the tyranny at , that of the Cypselids,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor even this lasted seventy-three and a half years, as Cypselus was tyrant for\n\t\t\t\t\tthirty years, Periander for forty-four, and Psammetichus son of Gordias for three years. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthe reasons for the permanence of this tyranny also are the same: Cypselus was a\n\t\t\t\t\tleader of the people and continuously throughout his period of office dispensed\n\t\t\t\t\twith a bodyguard; and although Periander became tyrannical, yet he was warlike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe third longest tyranny is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of the Pisistratidae at ,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut it was not continuous; for while Pisistratus was tyrant he twice fled into exile,\n\t\t\t\t\tso that in a period of thirty-three years he was tyrant for seventeen years out\n\t\t\t\t\tof the total, and his sons for eighteen years, so that the whole duration of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir rule was thirty-five years. Among the remaining tyrannies is the one\n\t\t\t\t\tconnected with Hiero and Gelo at , but\n\t\t\t\t\teven this did not last many years, but only eighteen in all, for Gelo after\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing tyrant for seven years ended his life in the eighth, and Hiero ruled ten\n\t\t\t\t\tyears, but Thrasybulus was expelled after ten months. And the usual tyrannies\n\t\t\t\t\thave all of them been of quite short duration.The\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses therefore of the destruction of constitutional governments and of\n\t\t\t\t\tmonarchies and those again of their preservation have almost all of them been\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed. The subject of revolutions is discussed by Socrates in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRepublic, but is not discussed\n\t\t\t\t\twell. For his account of revolution in the constitution that is the best one and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first does not apply to it particularly. He says that the cause is that\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing is permanent but everything changes in a certain cycle, and that change\n\t\t\t\t\thas its origin in those numbers whose basic ratio 4 : 3 linked with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe number 5 gives two harmonies,meaning whenever the\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of this figure becomes cubed,in the belief that nature\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes engenders men that are evil, and too strong for education to\n\t\t\t\t\tinfluencespeaking perhaps not ill as far as this particular dictum\n\t\t\t\t\tgoes for it is possible that there are some persons incapable of being\n\t\t\t\t\teducated and becoming men of noble character, but why should this\n\t\t\t\t\tprocess of revolution belong to the constitution which Socrates speaks of as the\n\t\t\t\t\tbest, more than to all the other forms of constitution, and to all men that come\n\t\t\t\t\tinto existence? and why merely by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe operation of time, which he says is the cause of change in all things, do\n\t\t\t\t\teven things that did not begin to exist simultaneously change simultaneously?\n\t\t\t\t\tfor instance, if a thing came into existence the day before the completion of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cycle, why does it yet change simultaneously with everything else? And in\n\t\t\t\t\taddition to these points, what is the reason why the republic changes from the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution mentioned into the Spartan form? For\n\t\t\t\t\tall constitutions more often change into the opposite form than into\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheone near them. And the same\n\t\t\t\t\tremark applies to the other revolutions as well. For from the Spartan\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution the state changes, he says, to oligarchy, and from this to\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy, and from democracy to tyranny. Yet revolutions also occur the other\n\t\t\t\t\tway about, for example from democracy to oligarchy, and more often so than from\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy to monarchy. Again as to\n\t\t\t\t\ttyranny he does not say whether it will undergo revolution or not, nor, if it\n\t\t\t\t\twill, what will be the cause of it, and into what sort of constitution it will\n\t\t\t\t\tchange; and the reason for this is that he would not have found it easy to say,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor it is irregular; since according to him tyranny ought to change into the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst and best constitution, for so the process would be continuous and a\n\t\t\t\t\tcircle, but as a matter of fact tyranny also changes into tyranny, as the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution of  passed from the tyranny\n\t\t\t\t\tof Myron to that of Cleisthenes, and into oligarchy, as did that of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntileon\n\t\t\t\t\tat , and into democracy, as\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of the family of Gelo at , and\n\t\t\t\t\tinto aristocracy, as that of Charilaus at \n\t\t\t\t\tand as at .\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd constitutions change from\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy to tyranny, as did almost the greatest number of the ancient\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchies in , at Leontini to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe tyranny of Panaetius, at Gelo to that of Cleander, at  to that of Anaxilaus, and in many other cities similarly. And it is also a strange\n\t\t\t\t\tidea that revolutions into oligarchy take place because the occupants of the\n\t\t\t\t\toffices are lovers of money and engaged in money-making, but not because\n\t\t\t\t\towners of much more than the average amount of property think it unjust for\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who do not own any property to have an equal share in the state with those\n\t\t\t\t\twho do; and in many oligarchies those in office are not allowed to engage in\n\t\t\t\t\tbusiness, but there are laws preventing it, whereas in , which has a democratic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment, the magistrates go\n\t\t\t\t\tin for business, and they have not yet had a revolution. And it is also a strange remark that the oligarchical state is two states, one of rich men and one of\n\t\t\t\t\tpoor men. For what has happened to this state rather than to the Spartan or any\n\t\t\t\t\tother sort of state where all do not own an equal amount of wealth or where all\n\t\t\t\t\tare not equally good men? and when nobody has become poorer than he was before,\n\t\t\t\t\tnone the less revolution takes place from oligarchy to democracy if the men of\n\t\t\t\t\tno property become more numerous, and from democracy to oligarchy if the wealthy\n\t\t\t\t\tclass is stronger than the multitude and the latter neglect politics but the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer give their mind to them. And although there are many causes through which\n\t\t\t\t\trevolutions in oligarchies occur, he mentions only onethat of men\n\t\t\t\t\tbecoming poor through riotous living, by paying away their money in interest on\n\t\t\t\t\tloansas if at the start all men or most men were rich. But this is not true, but although when\n\t\t\t\t\tsome of the leaders have lost their properties they stir up innovations, when\n\t\t\t\t\tmen of the other classes are ruined nothing strange happens;and even when such a revolution does occur it is no\n\t\t\t\t\tmore likely to end in a democracy than in another form of constitution. And\n\t\t\t\t\tfurthermore men also form factions and cause revolutions in the constitution if\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are not allowed a share of honors, and if they are unjustly or insolently\n\t\t\t\t\ttreated, even if they have not run through all their property . . . because of being allowed to do whatever they like;\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cause of which he states to be excessive liberty. And although there are\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral forms of oligarchy and of democracy, Socrates speaks of the revolutions\n\t\t\t\t\tthat occur in them as though there were only one form of each."}}, {"@n":

But as a matter of fact since there\n\t\t\t\t\thave come into existence several kinds of democracy and similarly of the other\n\t\t\t\t\tforms of constitution, it will be well at the same time to consider any point that\n\t\t\t\t\tremains about these varieties, and also determine the mode of organization\n\t\t\t\t\tappropriate and advantageous for each. And further we must also investigate the\n\t\t\t\t\tcombinations of all the modes of organizing the actual departments of state that\n\t\t\t\t\thave been mentioned,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor these modes when coupled together make the constitutions overlap, so as to\n\t\t\t\t\tproduce oligarchical aristocracies and republics inclining towards democracy. I\n\t\t\t\t\trefer to the combinations which ought to be investigated but have not at present\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen studied, for example if the deliberative body and the system of electing\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates are organized oligarchically but the regulations as to the\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw-courts aristocratically, or these and the structure of the deliberative body\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchically and the election of magistracy aristocratically, or if in some\n\t\t\t\t\tother manner not all the parts of the constitution are appropriately\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcombined.Now it has been stated before what kind of democracy is\n\t\t\t\t\tsuited to what kind of state, and similarly which of the kinds of oligarchy is\n\t\t\t\t\tsuited to what kind of populace, and also which of the remaining constitutions\n\t\t\t\t\tis advantageous for which people; but nevertheless since it must not only be\n\t\t\t\t\tmade clear which variety of these constitutions is best for states, but also how\n\t\t\t\t\tboth these best varieties and the other forms must be established, let us\n\t\t\t\t\tbriefly pursue the subject. And first let us speak about democracy; for at the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame time the facts will also become clear about the opposite form of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, that is, the constitution which some people call oligarchy.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd\n\t\t\t\t\tfor this inquiry we must take into view all the features that are popular and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are thoughtto go with\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracies; for it comes about from combinations of these that the kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy are formed, and that there are different democracies and more than one\n\t\t\t\t\tsort. In fact there are two causes for there being several kinds of democracy,\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst the one stated before, the fact that the populations are different\n\t\t\t\t\tfor we find one multitude engaged in agriculture and another\n\t\t\t\t\tconsisting of handicraftsmen and day-laborers, and when the first of these is\n\t\t\t\t\tadded to the second and again the third to both of them it not only makes a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference in that the quality of the democracy becomes better or worse but also\n\t\t\t\t\tby its becoming different in kind; and the second cause is the one\n\t\t\t\t\tabout which we now speak. For the\n\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions that go with democracies and seem to be appropriate to this form of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution make the democracies different by their combinations; for one form\n\t\t\t\t\tof democracy will be accompanied by fewer, another by more, and another by all\n\t\t\t\t\tof them. And it is serviceable to ascertain each of them both for the purpose of\n\t\t\t\t\tinstituting whichever of these kinds of democracy one happens to wish and for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe purpose of amending existing ones. For people setting up constitutions seek\n\t\t\t\t\tto collect together all the features appropriate to their fundamental principle,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut in so doing they make a mistake, as has been said before in the passage\n\t\t\t\t\tdealing with the causes of the destruction and the preservation of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions. And now let us state the postulates, the ethical characters and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe aims of the various forms of democracy.Now a fundamental principle\n\t\t\t\t\tof the democratic form of constitution is libertythat is what is\n\t\t\t\t\tusually asserted, implying that only under this constitution do men participate\n\t\t\t\t\tin liberty, for they assert this as the aim of every democracy. But one\n\t\t\t\t\tfactor of liberty is to govern and be governed in turn; for the popular\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple of justice is to have equality according to number, not worth, and if\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is the principle of justice prevailing, the multitude must of necessity be\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereign and the decision of the majority must be final and must constitute\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice, for they say that each of the citizens ought to have an equal share; so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it results that in democracies the poor are more powerful than the rich,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause there are more of them and whatever is decided by the majority is\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereign. This then is one mark of\n\t\t\t\t\tliberty which all democrats set down as a principle of the constitution. And one\n\t\t\t\t\tis for a man to live as he likes; for they say that this is the function of\n\t\t\t\t\tliberty, inasmuch as to live not as one likes is the life of a man that is a\n\t\t\t\t\tslave. This is the second principle of democracy, and from it has come the claim\n\t\t\t\t\tnot to be governed, preferably not by anybody, or failing that, to govern and be\n\t\t\t\t\tgoverned in turns; and this is the way in which the second principle contributes\n\t\t\t\t\tto equalitarian liberty.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd these principles having been\n\t\t\t\t\tlaid down and this being the nature of democratic government, the following\n\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions are democratic in character: election of officials by all from all;\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment of each by all,and of all\n\t\t\t\t\tby each in turn; election by lot either to all magistracies or to all that do\n\t\t\t\t\tnot need experience and skill; no property-qualification for office, or only a\n\t\t\t\t\tvery low one; no office to be held twice, or more than a few times, by the same\n\t\t\t\t\tperson, or few offices except the military ones; short tenure either of all\n\t\t\t\t\toffices or of as many as possible; judicial functions to be exercised by all\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens, that is by persons selected from all, and on all matters, or on most\n\t\t\t\t\tand the greatest and most important, for instance the audit of official\n\t\t\t\t\taccounts, constitutional questions, private contracts; the assembly to be\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereign over all matters, but no official over any or only over extremely few;\n\t\t\t\t\tor else a council to be sovereign over the most important matters and a council is the most\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocratic of magistracies in states where there is not a plentiful supply of\n\t\t\t\t\tpay for everybodyfor where there is, they deprive even this office of\n\t\t\t\t\tits power, since the people draws all the trials to itself when it has plenty of\n\t\t\t\t\tpay, as has been said before in the treatise preceding this one; also\n\t\t\t\t\tpayment for public duties, preferably in all branches, assembly, law-courts,\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistracies, or if not, for the magistracies, the law-courts, council and\n\t\t\t\t\tsovereign assemblies, or for those magistracies which are bound to have common mess tables. Also inasmuch as\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy is defined by birth, wealth and education, the popular qualifications\n\t\t\t\t\tare thought to be the opposite of these, low birth, poverty, vulgarity. And in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect of the magistracies it is democratic to have none tenable for life,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand if any life-office has been left after an ancient\n\t\t\t\t\trevolution, at all events to deprive it of its power and to substitute election\n\t\t\t\t\tby lot for election by vote.These then are the features common to democracies. But what is\n\t\t\t\t\tthought to be the extreme form of democracy and of popular government comes\n\t\t\t\t\tabout as a result of the principle of justice that is admitted to be democratic,\n\t\t\t\t\tand this is for all to have equality according to number. For it is equality for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe poor to have no larger share of power than the rich, and not for the poor\n\t\t\t\t\talone to be supreme but for all to govern equally; for in this way they would\n\t\t\t\t\tfeel that the constitution possessed both equality and liberty. But the question follows, how will they\n\t\t\t\t\thave equality? are the property-assessments of five hundred citizens to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdivided among a thousand and the thousand to have equal power to the five\n\t\t\t\t\t\thundred? or is equality on this principle not to be arranged in this manner, but the\n\t\t\t\t\tdivision into classes to be on this system, but then an equal number to be taken\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the five hundred and from the thousand and these to control the elections\n\t\t\t\t\tand the law-courts? Is this then the justest form of constitution in accordance\n\t\t\t\t\twith popular justice, or is it rather one that goes by counting heads? For democrats say that justice is whatever seems\n\t\t\t\t\tgood to the larger number,but\n\t\t\t\t\tadvocates of oligarchy think that it is whatever seems good to the owners of the\n\t\t\t\t\tlarger amount of property, for they say that the decision ought to go by amount\n\t\t\t\t\tof property. But both views involve\n\t\t\t\t\tinequality and injustice; for if the will of the few is to prevail, this means a\n\t\t\t\t\ttyranny, since if one man owns more than the other rich men, according to the oligarchic principle of justice it is just\n\t\t\t\t\tfor him to rule alone; whereas if the will of the numerical majority is to\n\t\t\t\t\tprevail, they will do injustice by confiscating the property of the rich\n\t\t\t\t\tminority, as has been said before. What form of equality therefore would be one on which both\n\t\t\t\t\tparties will agree must be considered in the light of the principles of justice\n\t\t\t\t\tas defined by both sets. For they say that whatever seems good to the majority\n\t\t\t\t\tof the citizens ought to be sovereign. Let us then accept this principle, yet not wholly without\n\t\t\t\t\tqualification, but inasmuch as fortune has brought into existence two component\n\t\t\t\t\tparts of the state, rich and poor, let any resolution passed by both classes, or\n\t\t\t\t\tby a majority of each, be sovereign, but if the two classes carry opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tresolutions, let the decision of the majority, in the sense of the group whose\n\t\t\t\t\ttotal property assessment is the larger, prevail: for instance, if there are ten\n\t\t\t\t\trich citizens and twenty poor ones, and opposite votes have been cast by six of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rich on one side and by fifteen of the less wealthy on the other, four of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rich have sided with the poor and five of the poor with the rich; then the\n\t\t\t\t\tside that has the larger total property when the assessments of both classes on\n\t\t\t\t\teither side are added together carries the voting.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut if the totals fall out exactly\n\t\t\t\t\tequal, this is to be deemed an impasse common to both sides, as it is at present\n\t\t\t\t\tif the assembly or law-court is exactly divided; either a decision\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be made by casting lots or some other such device must be adopted. But on\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions of equality and justice, even though it is very difficult to discover\n\t\t\t\t\tthe truth about them, nevertheless it is easier to hit upon it than to persuade\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople that have the power to get an advantage to agree to it; equality and\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice are always sought by the weaker party, but those that have the upper\n\t\t\t\t\thand pay no attention to them.There being four kinds of democracy, the\n\t\t\t\t\tbest is the one that stands first in structure, as was said in the discourses\n\t\t\t\t\tpreceding these; it is also the oldest of them all, but by first I mean first\n\t\t\t\t\tas it were in a classification of the kinds of common people. The best common\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople are the agricultural population, so that it is possible to introduce\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy as well as other forms of constitution where the multitude lives by\n\t\t\t\t\tagriculture or by pasturing cattle. For owing to their not having much property\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are busy, so that they cannot often meet in the assembly, while owing to\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir having the necessaries of life they pass their time\n\t\t\t\t\tattending to their farm work and do not covet their neighbors' goods, but find\n\t\t\t\t\tmore pleasure in working than in taking part in politics and holding office,\n\t\t\t\t\twhere the profits to be made from the offices are not large; for the mass of\n\t\t\t\t\tmankind are more covetous of gain than of honor. And this is indicated by the fact that men endured the\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrannies of former times, and endure oligarchies, if a ruler does not prevent\n\t\t\t\t\tthem from working orrob them; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthen some of them soon get rich and the others free from want. And also, if they\n\t\t\t\t\thave any ambition, to have control over electing magistrates and calling them to\n\t\t\t\t\taccount makes up for the lack of office, since in some democracies even if the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople have no part in electing the magistrates but these are elected by a\n\t\t\t\t\tspecial committee selected in turn out of the whole number, as at , yet if they have the power of\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberating on policy, the multitude are satisfied. And this too must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe counted as one form of democracy, on the lines on which it once existed at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t. Indeed it is for this reason that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantageous for the form of democracy spoken of before, and is a customary\n\t\t\t\t\tinstitution in it, for all the citizens to elect the magistrates and call them\n\t\t\t\t\tto account, and to try law-suits, but for the holders of the greatest\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistracies to be elected and to have property-qualifications, the higher\n\t\t\t\t\toffices being elected from the higher property-grades, or else for no office to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe elected on a property-qualification, but for officials to be chosen on the\n\t\t\t\t\tground of capacity. And a state governed in this way is bound to be governed\n\t\t\t\t\twell for the offices will always be administered by the best men with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe consent of the people and without their being jealous of the upper\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses, and this arrangement is certain to be satisfactory for the\n\t\t\t\t\tupper classes and notables, for they will not be under the government of others\n\t\t\t\t\tinferior to themselves, and they will govern justly because a different class\n\t\t\t\t\twill be in control of the auditssince it is expedient to be in a state of suspense and not\n\t\t\t\t\tto be able to do everything exactly as seems good to one, for liberty to do\n\t\t\t\t\twhatever one likes cannot guard against the evil that is in every man's\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter. Hence there necessarily results the condition of affairs that\n\t\t\t\t\tis the most advantageous in the government of statesfor the upper\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses to govern without doing wrong, the common people not being deprived of\n\t\t\t\t\tany rights. It is manifest therefore that this is the best of the forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy, and why this is sonamely, because in it the common people\n\t\t\t\t\tare of a certain kind.For the purpose of making the people an agricultural\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunity, not only were some of the laws that were enacted in many states in\n\t\t\t\t\tearly times entirely serviceable, prohibiting the ownership of more than a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain amount of land under any conditions or else of more than a certain\n\t\t\t\t\tamount lying between a certain place and the citadel or city and in\n\t\t\t\t\tearly times at all events in many states there was even legislation prohibiting\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sale of the original allotments; and there is a law said to be due to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOxylus\n\t\t\t\t\twith some similar provision, forbidding loans secured on a certain portion of a\n\t\t\t\t\tman's existing estate, but\n\t\t\t\t\tat the present day it would also be well to introduce reform by means of the law\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Aphytaeans, as it is serviceable for the purpose of which we are\n\t\t\t\t\tspeaking; the citizens of Aphytis although\n\t\t\t\t\tnumerous and possessing a small territory nevertheless are all engaged in\n\t\t\t\t\tagriculture, for they are assessed not on the whole of their estates, but on\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisions of them so small that even the poor can exceed the required minimum in\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir assessments.\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter\n\t\t\t\t\tthe agricultural communitythe best\n\t\t\t\t\tkind of democracy is where the people are herdsmen and get their living from\n\t\t\t\t\tcattle; for this life has many points of resemblance to agriculture, and as\n\t\t\t\t\tregards military duties pastoral people are in a very well trained condition and\n\t\t\t\t\tserviceable in body and capable of living in the open. But almost all the other\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses of populace, of which the remaining kinds of democracy are composed, are\n\t\t\t\t\tvery inferior to these, for their mode of life is mean, and there is no element\n\t\t\t\t\tof virtue in any of the occupations in which the multitude of artisans and\n\t\t\t\t\tmarket-people and the wage-earning class take part, and also owing to their\n\t\t\t\t\tloitering about the market-place and the city almost all people of this class\n\t\t\t\t\tfind it easy to attend the assembly; whereas the farmers owing to their being\n\t\t\t\t\tscattered over the country do not attend, and have not an equal desire for this\n\t\t\t\t\topportunity of meeting. And where it\n\t\t\t\t\talso happens that the lie of the land is such that the country is widely\n\t\t\t\t\tseparated from the city, it is easy to establish a good democracy and also a\n\t\t\t\t\tgood constitutional government, for the multitude is forced to live at a\n\t\t\t\t\tdistance on the farms; and so, even if there is a crowd that frequents the\n\t\t\t\t\tmarket-place, it is best in democracies not to hold assemblies without the\n\t\t\t\t\tmultitude scattered over the country.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt has then been stated how the best and first\n\t\t\t\t\tkind of democracy is to be organized, and it is clear how we ought to organize\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other kinds also. For they must diverge in a corresponding order, and at\n\t\t\t\t\teach stage we must admit the next inferior class. The last kind of democracy, because all the\n\t\t\t\t\tpopulation share in the government, it is not within the power of every state to\n\t\t\t\t\tendure, and it is not easy for it to persist if it is not well constituted in\n\t\t\t\t\tits laws and customs but the things that result in destroying both\n\t\t\t\t\tthis state and the other forms of constitution have been nearly all of them\n\t\t\t\t\tspoken of before.\n\t\t\t\t\tWith a view to setting up this kind of democracy and making the people powerful\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir leaders usually acquire as many supporters as possible and admit to\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizenship not only the legitimate children of citizens but also the base-born\n\t\t\t\t\tand those of citizen-birth on one side, I mean those whose father or mother is a\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen; for all this element is specially congenial to a to democracy of this\n\t\t\t\t\tsort. Popular leaders therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tregularly introduce such institutions; they ought however only to go on adding\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens up to the point where the multitude outnumbers the notables and the\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle class and not to go beyond that point; for if they exceed it they make\n\t\t\t\t\tthe government more disorderly, and also provoke the notables further in the\n\t\t\t\t\tdirection of being reluctant to endure the democracy, which actually took place\n\t\t\t\t\tand caused the revolution at ; for a small base element is\n\t\t\t\t\toverlooked, but when it grows numerous it is more in evidence.A\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy of this kind will also find useful such institutions as were employed\n\t\t\t\t\tby Cleisthenes at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t when he wished to\n\t\t\t\t\tincrease the power of the democracy, and by the party setting up the democracy\n\t\t\t\t\tat ; different tribes and\n\t\t\t\t\tbrotherhoods must be created outnumbering the old ones, and the celebrations of\n\t\t\t\t\tprivate religious rites must be grouped together into a small number of public\n\t\t\t\t\tcelebrations, and every device must be employed to make all the people as much\n\t\t\t\t\tas possible intermingled with one another, and to break up the previously\n\t\t\t\t\texisting groups of associates. Moreover the characteristics of a tyranny also are all thought to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocratic, I mean for instance licence among slaves, which may really be\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantageous for the popular party up to a point, and among women and children,\n\t\t\t\t\tand indulgence to live as one likes; a constitution of this sort will have a\n\t\t\t\t\tlarge number of supporters, as disorderly living is pleasanter to the mass of\n\t\t\t\t\tmankind than sober living.But it is not the greatest or only task of the\n\t\t\t\t\tlegislator or of those who desire to construct a constitution of this kind\n\t\t\t\t\tmerely to set it up, but rather to ensure its preservation; for it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult for any form of constitution to last for one or two or three days. We\n\t\t\t\t\tmust therefore employ the results obtained in the inquiries that we have made\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready into the causes of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe preservation and the destruction of constitutions, and attempt in the light\n\t\t\t\t\tof those results to establish the safety of the state, carefully avoiding the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings that cause destruction, and enacting such laws both written and unwritten\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas shall best compass the results preservative of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions, and not think that a measure is democratic or oligarchic which\n\t\t\t\t\twill cause the state to be democratically or oligarchically governed in the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatest degree, but which will cause it to be so governed for the longest time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the demagogues of today to\n\t\t\t\t\tcourt the favor of the peoples often use the law-courts to bring about\n\t\t\t\t\tconfiscations of property. Hence those who are caring for the safety of the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution must counteract this by enacting that nothing belonging to persons\n\t\t\t\t\tcondemned at law shall be confiscated and liable to be carried to the public\n\t\t\t\t\ttreasury, but that their property shall be consecrated to the service of\n\t\t\t\t\treligion; for male-factors will be no less on their guard, as they will be\n\t\t\t\t\tpunished just the same, while the mob will less often vote guilty against men on\n\t\t\t\t\ttrial when it is not going to get anything out of it. Also they must always make\n\t\t\t\t\tthe public trials that occur as few as possible, checking those who bring\n\t\t\t\t\tindictments at random by big penalties; for they do not usually indict men of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people but notables, whereas even with this form of constitution it is\n\t\t\t\t\tdesirable for all the citizens if possible to be friendly to the state, or\n\t\t\t\t\tfailing that, at all events not to think of their rulers as enemies. And inasmuch as the ultimate forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy tend to have large populations and it is difficult for their citizens\n\t\t\t\t\tto sit in the assembly without pay, and this in a state where there do not\n\t\t\t\t\thappen to be revenues is inimical to the notables for pay has to be obtained from a property-tax and\n\t\t\t\t\tconfiscation, and from corruption of the law-courts, which has caused the\n\t\t\t\t\toverthrow of many democracies before now,where therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tthere happen to be no revenues, few meetings of the assembly must be held, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe law-courts must consist of many members but only sit a few days\n\t\t\t\t\tfor this not only contributes to the rich not being in fear of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcost of the system even if the well-off do not take the pay and only the poor\n\t\t\t\t\tdo, but also leads to far greater efficiency in the trial of law-suits, for the\n\t\t\t\t\twell-to-do, though not wishing to be away from their private affairs for many\n\t\t\t\t\tdays, are willing to leave them for a short time, while where there are revenues men must not do what\n\t\t\t\t\tthe popular leaders do now for they use the surplus for doles, and\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople no sooner get them than they want the same doles again, because this way\n\t\t\t\t\tof helping the poor is the legendary jar with a hole in it, but the truly democratic statesman must study how\n\t\t\t\t\tthe multitude may be saved from extreme poverty; for this is what causes\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy to be corrupt. Measures must therefore be contrived that may bring\n\t\t\t\t\tabout lasting prosperity. And since this is advantageous also for the\n\t\t\t\t\twell-to-do, the proper course is to collect all the proceeds of the revenues\n\t\t\t\t\tinto a fund and distribute this in lump sums to the needy, best of all, if one\n\t\t\t\t\tcan, in sums large enough for acquiring a small estate, or, failing this, to\n\t\t\t\t\tserve as capital for trade or husbandry, and if this is not possible for\n\t\t\t\t\tall, at all events to distribute the money by tribes or some other division of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe population in turn, while in the meantime the well-to-do must contribute pay\n\t\t\t\t\tfor attendance at the necessary assemblies, being themselves excused from\n\t\t\t\t\tuseless public services. By\n\t\t\t\t\tfollowing some such policy as this the Carthaginians have won the friendship of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe common people; for they constantly send out some of the people to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsurrounding territories and so make them well-off. And if the notables are men\n\t\t\t\t\tof good feeling and sense they may also divide the needy among them in groups\n\t\t\t\t\tand supply them with capital to start them in businesses. It is also a good plan\n\t\t\t\t\tto imitate the policy of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Tarentines. They get the goodwill of the multitude by making property\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunal for the purpose of use by the needy; also they have divided the whole number of their\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistracies into two classes, one elected by vote and the other filled by\n\t\t\t\t\tlot,the latter to ensure that the people may have a share in them,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the former to improve the conduct of public affairs. And it is also possible\n\t\t\t\t\tto effect this by dividing the holders of the same magistracy into two groups,\n\t\t\t\t\tone appointed by lot and the other by vote.We\n\t\t\t\t\thave then said how democracies should be organized.It is also fairly clear\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom these considerations how oligarchies ought to be organized. We must infer\n\t\t\t\t\tthem from their opposites, reasoning out each form of oligarchywith reference to the form of democracy opposite to\n\t\t\t\t\tit, starting with the most well-blended and first form of oligarchyand this is the one near to what is\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled a constitutional government, and for it the property-qualifications must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe divided into one group of smaller properties and another of larger ones,\n\t\t\t\t\tsmaller properties qualifying their owners for the indispensable offices and\n\t\t\t\t\tlarger ones for the more important; and a person owning the qualifying property\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be allowed to take a share in the government,introducing by the\n\t\t\t\t\tassessment a large enough number of the common people to secure that with them\n\t\t\t\t\tthe governing class will have a majority over those excluded; and persons to\n\t\t\t\t\tshare in the government must constantly be brought in from the better class of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe common people. And the next form\n\t\t\t\t\tof oligarchy also must be constructed in a similar way with a slight tightening\n\t\t\t\t\tup of the qualification. But the form of oligarchy that stands opposite to the\n\t\t\t\t\tlast form of democracy, the most autocratic and tyrannical of the oligarchies,\n\t\t\t\t\tin as far as it is the worst requires a correspondingly great amount of\n\t\t\t\t\tsafe-guarding. For just as human bodies in a good state of health and ships well\n\t\t\t\t\tequipped with their crews for a voyage admit of more mistakes without being\n\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed thereby, but bodies of a morbid habit and vessels strained in their\n\t\t\t\t\ttimbers and manned with bad crews cannot endure even the smallest mistakes, so\n\t\t\t\t\talso the worst constitutions need the most safe-guarding. Democracies therefore generally speaking are kept\n\t\t\t\t\tsafe by the largeness of the citizen-body, for this is the antithesis of justice\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to desert; but oligarchy on the contrary must manifestly obtain its\n\t\t\t\t\tsecurity by means of good organization.And since\n\t\t\t\t\tthe mass of the population falls principally into four divisions, the farming\n\t\t\t\t\tclass, artisans, retail traders and hired laborers, and military forces are of\n\t\t\t\t\tfour classes, cavalry, heavy infantry, light infantry and marines, in places\n\t\t\t\t\twhere the country happens to be suitable for horsemanship, there natural\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions favor the establishment of an oligarchy that will be powerful\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the security of the inhabitants depends on the strength of this\n\t\t\t\t\telement, and keeping studs of horses is the pursuit of those who own extensive\n\t\t\t\t\testates; and where the ground is suitable for heavy infantry,\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions favor the next form of oligarchy for heavy infantry is a\n\t\t\t\t\tservice for the well-to-do rather than the poor; but light infantry\n\t\t\t\t\tand naval forces are an entirely democratic element. As things are therefore, where there is a large multitude\n\t\t\t\t\tof this class, when party strife occurs the oligarchs often get the worst of the\n\t\t\t\t\tstruggle; and a remedy for this must be adopted from military commanders, who\n\t\t\t\t\tcombine with their cavalry and heavy infantry forces a contingent of light\n\t\t\t\t\tinfantry. And this is the way in which the common people get the better over the\n\t\t\t\t\twell-to-do in outbreaks of party strife:being unencumbered they fight easily against cavalry and heavy\n\t\t\t\t\tinfantry. Therefore to establish\n\t\t\t\t\tthis force out of this class is to establish it against itself, but the right\n\t\t\t\t\tplan is for the men of military age to be separated into a division of older and\n\t\t\t\t\tone of younger men, and to have their own sons while still young trained in the\n\t\t\t\t\texercises of light and unarmed troops, and for youths selected from among the\n\t\t\t\t\tboys to be themselves trained in active operations. And the bestowal of a share\n\t\t\t\t\tin the government upon the multitude should either go on the lines stated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore, and be\n\t\t\t\t\tmade to those who acquire the property-qualification, or as at , to people after they have abstained\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a time from mechanic industries, or as at , by making a selection among members of the\n\t\t\t\t\tgoverning classes and those outside it of persons who deserve inclusion. And furthermore the most supreme offices also, which must be retained by those\n\t\t\t\t\twithin the constitution, must have expensive duties attached to them, in order\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the common people may be willing to be excluded from them, and may feel no\n\t\t\t\t\tresentment against the ruling class, because it pays a high price for office.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd it fits in with this that they should offer splendid sacrifices and build up\n\t\t\t\t\tsome public monument on entering upon office, so that the common people sharing\n\t\t\t\t\tin the festivities and seeing the city decorated both with votive offerings and\n\t\t\t\t\twith building may be glad to see the constitution enduring; and an additional\n\t\t\t\t\tresult will be that the notables will have memorials of their outlay. But at\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent the members of oligarchies do not adopt this course but the opposite,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor they seek the gains of office just as much as the honor; hence these\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchies are well described as miniature democracies.\n\t\t\t\t\tLet this then be a description of the proper way to organize the various forms\n\t\t\t\t\tof democracy and of oligarchy.As a consequence of what has been said\n\t\t\t\t\tthere follow satisfactory conclusions to the questions concerning\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistracieshow many and what they should be and to whom they should\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong, as has also been said before. For without the indispensable magistracies a state cannot\n\t\t\t\t\texist, while without those that contribute to good order and seemliness it\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot be well governed. And furthermore the magistracies are bound to be fewer\n\t\t\t\t\tin the small states and more numerous in the large ones, as in fact has been\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid before; it\n\t\t\t\t\tmust therefore be kept in view what kinds of magistracies it is desirable to\n\t\t\t\t\tcombine and what kinds to keep separate. First among the indispensable services is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperintendence of the market, over which there must be an official to\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperintend contracts and good order; since it is a necessity for almost all\n\t\t\t\t\tstates that people shall sell some things and buy others according to one\n\t\t\t\t\tanother's necessary requirements, and this is the readiest means of securing\n\t\t\t\t\tself-sufficiency, which seems to be the reason for men's having united into a\n\t\t\t\t\tsingle state. Another\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperintendency connected very closely with this one is the curatorship of\n\t\t\t\t\tpublic and private properties in the city,to secure good order and the preservation and rectification of\n\t\t\t\t\tfalling buildings and roads, and of the bounds between different persons'\n\t\t\t\t\testates, so that disputes may not arise about them, and all the other duties of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperintendence similar to these. An office of this nature is in most states\n\t\t\t\t\tentitled that of City-controller, but it has several departments, each of which\n\t\t\t\t\tis filled by separate officials in the states with larger populations, for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance Curators of Walls, Superintendents of Wells, Harbors-guardians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd another office also is\n\t\t\t\t\tindispensable and closely akin to these, for it controls the same matters but\n\t\t\t\t\tdeals with the country and there regions outside the city; and these magistrates\n\t\t\t\t\tare called in some places Land-controllers and in others Custodians of Forests.\n\t\t\t\t\tThese then are three departments of control over these matters, while another\n\t\t\t\t\toffice is that to which the revenues of the public funds are paid in, the\n\t\t\t\t\tofficials who guard them and by whom they are divided out to the several\n\t\t\t\t\tadministrative departments; these magistrates are called Receivers and Stewards.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnother magistracy is the one that has to receive a written return of private\n\t\t\t\t\tcontracts and of the verdicts of the law-courts; and with these same officials\n\t\t\t\t\tthe registration of legal proceedings and their institution have also to take\n\t\t\t\t\tplace. In some states this office also is divided into several, but there are\n\t\t\t\t\tplaces where one magistracy controls all these matters; and these officials are\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled Sacred Recorders, Superintendents, Recorders, and other names akin to\n\t\t\t\t\tthese. And after these is the office\n\t\t\t\t\tconnected with it but perhaps the most indispensable and most difficult of all,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe one concerned with the execution of judgement upon persons cast in suits and\n\t\t\t\t\tthose posted as defaulters according to the lists, and with the\n\t\t\t\t\tcustody of prisoners. This is an irksome office because it involves great\n\t\t\t\t\tunpopularity, so that where it is not possible to make a great deal of profit\n\t\t\t\t\tout of it men will not undertake it, or when they have undertaken it are\n\t\t\t\t\treluctant to carry out its functions according to the laws; but it is necessary,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause there is no use in trials being held about men's rights when the\n\t\t\t\t\tverdicts are not put into execution, so that if when no legal trial of disputes\n\t\t\t\t\ttakes place social intercourse is impossible, so also is it when judgements are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot executed. Hence it is better for\n\t\t\t\t\tthis magistracy not to be a single office but to consist of several persons\n\t\t\t\t\tdrawn from different courts, and it is desirable similarly to try to divide up\n\t\t\t\t\tthe functions connected with the posting up of people registered as public\n\t\t\t\t\tdebtors, and further also in some cases for the sentences to be executed by\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates, especially by the newly elected ones preferably in suits tried by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe outgoing ones, and in those tried by men actually in office for the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrate executing the sentence to be different from the one that passed it,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor instance the City-controllers to execute the judgements passed on from the\n\t\t\t\t\tMarket-controllers and other magistrates those passed on by the\n\t\t\t\t\tCity-controllers. For the less odium involved for those who execute the\n\t\t\t\t\tjudgements, the more adequately the judgements will be carried out; so for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame magistrates to have imposed the sentence and to execute it involves a\n\t\t\t\t\ttwofold odium, and for the same ones to execute it in all cases makes them the\n\t\t\t\t\tenemies of everybody. And in many\n\t\t\t\t\tplaces also the office of keeping custody of prisoners, for example at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t the office of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates known as the Eleven,is separate\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the magistracy that executes sentences. It is better therefore to keep this\n\t\t\t\t\talso separate, and to attempt the same device with regard to this as well. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthough it is no less necessary than the office of which I spoke, yet in practice\n\t\t\t\t\trespectable people avoid it most of all offices, while it is not safe to put it\n\t\t\t\t\tinto the hands of the base, for they themselves need others to guard them\n\t\t\t\t\tinstead of being able to keep guard over others. Hence there must not be one\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistracy specially assigned to the custody of prisoners nor must the same\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistracy perform this duty continuously, but it should be performed by the\n\t\t\t\t\tyoung, in places where there is a regiment of cadets or guards, and by the magistrates, in successive\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsections.These magistracies therefore must be counted first as supremely\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary, and next to them must be put those that are not less necessary but\n\t\t\t\t\tare ranked on a higher grade of dignity, because they require much experience\n\t\t\t\t\tand trustworthiness; in this class would come the magistracies concerned with\n\t\t\t\t\tguarding the city and those assigned to military requirements. And both in peace\n\t\t\t\t\tand in war it is equally necessary for there to be magistrates to superintend\n\t\t\t\t\tthe guarding of gates and walls and the inspection and drill of the citizen\n\t\t\t\t\ttroops. In some places therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are more magistracies assigned to all these duties, and in others\n\t\t\t\t\tfewerfor instance in the small states there is one to deal with all\n\t\t\t\t\tof them. And the officers of this sort are entitled Generals or War-lords.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd moreover if there are also cavalry or light infantry or\n\t\t\t\t\tarchers or a navy, sometimes a magistracy is appointed to have charge of each of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese arms also, and they carry the titles of Admiral, Cavalry-commander and\n\t\t\t\t\tTaxiarch, and also the divisional commissions subordinate to these of Captains\n\t\t\t\t\tof Triremes, Company-commanders and Captains of Tribes, and all the subdivisions\n\t\t\t\t\tof these commands. But the whole of this sort of officers constituted a single\n\t\t\t\t\tclass, that of military command. This then is how the matter stands in regard to this office; but inasmuch as\n\t\t\t\t\tsome of the magistracies, if not all, handle large sums of public money, there\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be another office to receive an account and subject it to audit, which must\n\t\t\t\t\titself handle no other business; and these officials are called Auditors by some\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople, Accountants by others, Examiners by others and Advocates by others. And\n\t\t\t\t\tby the side of all these offices is the one that is most supreme over all\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters, for often the same magistracy has the execution of business that\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrols its introduction, or presides over the general assembly in places where\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people are supreme; for the magistracy that convenes the sovereign assembly\n\t\t\t\t\tis bound to be the sovereign power in the state. It is styled in some places the\n\t\t\t\t\tPreliminary Council because it considers business in advance, but where there is\n\t\t\t\t\ta democracy it is more usually called a Council. This more or less\n\t\t\t\t\tcompletes the number of the offices of a political nature; but another kind of superintendence is that\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned with divine worship; in this class are priests and superintendents of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmattersconnected with the\n\t\t\t\t\ttemples, the preservation of existing buildings and the restoration of those\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are ruinous, and the other duties relating to the gods. In practice this\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperintendence in some places forms a single office, for instance in the small\n\t\t\t\t\tcities, but in others it belongs to a number of officials who are not members of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe priesthood, for example Sacrificial Officers and Temple-guardians and\n\t\t\t\t\tStewards of Sacred Funds. And connected with this is the office devoted to the\n\t\t\t\t\tmanagement of all the public festivals which the law does not assign to the\n\t\t\t\t\tpriests but the officials in charge of which derive their honor from the common\n\t\t\t\t\tsacrificial hearth, and these officials are called in some places Archons, in\n\t\t\t\t\tothers Kings and in others Presidents. To sum up therefore, the necessary offices of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperintendence deal with the following matters : institutions of religion,\n\t\t\t\t\tmilitary institutions, revenue and expenditure, control of the market, citadel,\n\t\t\t\t\tharbors and country, also the arrangements of the law-courts, registration of\n\t\t\t\t\tcontracts, collection of fines, custody of prisoners, supervision of accounts\n\t\t\t\t\tand inspections, and the auditing of officials, and lastly the offices connected\n\t\t\t\t\twith the body that deliberates about public affairs. On the other hand, peculiar to the states that have more\n\t\t\t\t\tleisure and prosperity, and also pay attention to public decorum, are the\n\t\t\t\t\toffices of Superintendent of Women, Guardian of the Laws, Superintendent of\n\t\t\t\t\tChildren, Controller of Physical Training, and in addition to these the\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperintendence of athletic and Dionysiac contests and of any similar displays\n\t\t\t\t\tthat happen to be held. Some of these offices are obviously not of a popular\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter, for instance that of Superintendent of Women and of Children; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tpoor having no slaves are forced to employ their women and children as servants.\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are three offices which in some states supervise the election of the chief\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistratesGuardians of the Laws, Preliminary Councillors and\n\t\t\t\t\tCouncil; of these the Guardians of the Laws are an aristocratic institution, the\n\t\t\t\t\tPreliminary Councillors oligarchic, and a Council democratic.We have now therefore spoken in outline about almost all the\n\t\t\t\t\toffices of state."}}, {"@n": "7", "@type": "Book", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1323a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "14", "@ed": "Bekker", "@unit": "line"},

For while this is uncertain it is also bound to be uncertain what\n\t\t\t\t\tis the best constitution, since it is to be expected that the people that have\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best form of government available under their given conditions will fare the\n\t\t\t\t\tbest, exceptional circumstances apart. Hence we must firstagree what life is most desirable for almost all\n\t\t\t\t\tmen, and after that whether the same life is most desirable both for the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunity and for the individual, or a different one. Believing therefore in the adequacy of much of what is\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid even in extraneous discourses on the subject of the best life, let us make\n\t\t\t\t\tuse of these pronouncements now. For as regards at all events one classification\n\t\t\t\t\tof things good, putting them in three groups, external goods, goods of the soul\n\t\t\t\t\tand goods of the body, assuredly nobody would deny that the ideally happy are\n\t\t\t\t\tbound to possess all three. For nobody would call a man ideally happy that has\n\t\t\t\t\tnot got a particle of courage nor of temperance nor of justice nor of wisdom,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut is afraid of the flies that flutter by him, cannot refrain from any of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmost outrageous actions in order to gratify a desire to eat or to drink, ruins\n\t\t\t\t\this dearest friends for the sake of a farthing, and similarly in matters of the\n\t\t\t\t\tintellect also is as senseless and mistaken as any child or lunatic. But although these are propositions which\n\t\t\t\t\twhen uttered everybody would agree to, yet men differ about amount and degrees\n\t\t\t\t\tof value. They think it is enough to possess however small a quantity of virtue,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut of wealth, riches, power, glory and everything of that kind they seek a\n\t\t\t\t\tlarger and larger amount without limit. We on the other hand shall tell them\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is easy to arrive at conviction on these matters in the light of the\n\t\t\t\t\tactual facts, when one sees that men do not acquire and preserve the virtues by\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans of these external goods, but external goods by means of the virtues,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that whether the life of happiness consists for man in\n\t\t\t\t\tenjoyment or in virtue or in both, it is found in larger measure with those who\n\t\t\t\t\tare of surpassingly high cultivation in character and intellect but only\n\t\t\t\t\tmoderate as regards the external acquisition of goods, than with those who own\n\t\t\t\t\tmore than they can use of the latter but are deficient in the former. Not but what the truth is also easily seen\n\t\t\t\t\tif we consider the matter in the light of reason. For external goods have a\n\t\t\t\t\tlimit, as has any instrument and everything useful is useful for\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething, so an excessive amount of them must necessarily do harm, or\n\t\t\t\t\tdo no good, to its possessor; whereas with any of the goods of the soul, the\n\t\t\t\t\tmore abundant it is, the more useful it must beif even to goods of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe soul not only the term noble but also the term\n\t\t\t\t\tuseful can be properly applied. And broadly, it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tthat we shall declare that the best condition of each particular thing,\n\t\t\t\t\tcomparing things with one another, corresponds in point of superiority to the\n\t\t\t\t\tdistance that subsists between the things of which we declare these conditions\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves to be conditions. Hence inasmuch as our soul is a more valuable\n\t\t\t\t\tthing both absolutely and relatively to ourselves than either our property or\n\t\t\t\t\tour body, the best conditions of these things must necessarily stand in the same\n\t\t\t\t\trelation to one another as the things themselves do. Moreover it is for the sake\n\t\t\t\t\tof the soul that these goods are in their nature desirable, and that all wise\n\t\t\t\t\tmen mustchoose them, not the soul for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of those other things. Let\n\t\t\t\t\tus then take it as agreed between us that to each man there falls just so large\n\t\t\t\t\ta measure of happiness as he achieves of virtue and wisdom and of virtuous and\n\t\t\t\t\twise action: in evidence of this we have the case of God, who is happy and\n\t\t\t\t\tblessed, but is so on account of no external goods, but on account of himself,\n\t\t\t\t\tand by being of a certain quality in his nature; since it is also for this\n\t\t\t\t\treason that prosperity is necessarily different from happinessfor the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of goods external to the soul is the spontaneous and fortune, but nobody is just\n\t\t\t\t\tor temperate as a result of or owing to the action of fortune. And connected is\n\t\t\t\t\ta truth requiring the same arguments to prove it, that it is also the best\n\t\t\t\t\tstate, and the one that does well,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is happy. But to do well is impossible save for those who do good actions,\n\t\t\t\t\tand there is no good action either of a man or of a state without virtue and\n\t\t\t\t\twisdom; and courage, justice and wisdom belonging to a state have the same\n\t\t\t\t\tmeaning and form as have those virtues whose possession bestows the titles of\n\t\t\t\t\tjust and wise and temperate on an individual human being.These remarks\n\t\t\t\t\thowever must suffice by way of preface to our discourse: for neither is it\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible to abstain from touching on these subjects altogether, nor is it\n\t\t\t\t\tfeasible to follow out all the arguments that are germane to them, for that is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe business of another course of study. For the present let us take it as\n\t\t\t\t\testablished that the best life, whether separately for an individual or\n\t\t\t\t\tcollectively for states, is the life conjoined with virtue furnished with\n\t\t\t\t\tsufficient means for taking part in virtuous actions; while objections to this position we must pass over\n\t\t\t\t\tin the course of the present inquiry, and reserve them for future consideration,\n\t\t\t\t\tif anyone be found to disagree with what has been said.On the other hand it\n\t\t\t\t\tremains to say whether the happiness of a state is to be pronounced the same as\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of each individual man, or whether it is different. Here too the answer is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear: everybody would agree that it is the same; for all those who base the\n\t\t\t\t\tgood life upon wealth in the case of the individual, also assign felicity to the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate as a whole if it is wealthy; and all who value the life of the tyrant\n\t\t\t\t\thighest, would also say that the state which rules the widest empire is the\n\t\t\t\t\thappiest; and if any body accepts the individual as happy on account of virtue,\n\t\t\t\t\the will also say that the state which is the better morally is the happier.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut there now arise these two\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions that require consideration: first, which mode of life is the more\n\t\t\t\t\tdesirable, the life of active citizenship and participation in politics, or\n\t\t\t\t\trather the life of an alien and that of detachment from the political\n\t\t\t\t\tpartnership; next, what constitution and what organization of a state is to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdeemed the best,either on the assumption that to take an active part\n\t\t\t\t\tin the state is desirable for everybody, or that it is undesirable for some men\n\t\t\t\t\talthough desirable for most. But as it isthe latter question that is the business of political study and\n\t\t\t\t\tspeculation, and not the question of what is desirable for the individual, and\n\t\t\t\t\tas it is the investigation of politics that we have now taken up, the former\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion would be a side issue, and the latter is the business of political\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinquiry.Now it is clear that the best constitution is the system under\n\t\t\t\t\twhich anybody whatsoever would be best off and would live in felicity; but the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion is raised even on the part of those who agree that the life accompanied\n\t\t\t\t\tby virtue is the most desirable, whether the life of citizenship and activity is\n\t\t\t\t\tdesirable or rather a life released from all external affairs, for example some\n\t\t\t\t\tform of contemplative life, which is said by some to be the only life that is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tphilosophic. For it is manifest that these are the two\n\t\t\t\t\tmodes of life principally chosen by the men most ambitious of excelling in\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue, both in past times and at the present dayI mean the life of\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitics and the life of philosophy. And it makes no little difference which way the truth lies; for assuredly the\n\t\t\t\t\twise are bound to arrange their affairs in the direction of the better\n\t\t\t\t\tgoaland this applies to the state collectively as well as to the\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual human being. Some persons think that empire over one's neighbors, if\n\t\t\t\t\tdespotically exercised, involves a definite injustice of the greatest kind, and\n\t\t\t\t\tif constitutionally, although it carries no injustice, yet is a hindrance to the\n\t\t\t\t\truler's own well-being; but others hold almost the opposite view to\n\t\t\t\t\tthesethey think that the life of action and citizenship is the only\n\t\t\t\t\tlife fit for a man, since with each of the virtues its exercise in actions is\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as possible for men engaged in public affairs and in politics as for those\n\t\t\t\t\twho live a private life. Some\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople then hold the former view, while others declare that the despotic and\n\t\t\t\t\ttyrannical form of constitution alone achieves happiness; and in some states it\n\t\t\t\t\tis also the distinctive aim of the constitution and the laws to enable them to\n\t\t\t\t\texercise despotic rule over their neighbors. Hence even though with most peoples\n\t\t\t\t\tmost of the legal ordinances have been laid down virtually at random,\n\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless if there are places where the laws aim at one definite object, that\n\t\t\t\t\tobject is in all cases power, as in  and  both\n\t\t\t\t\tthe system of education and the mass of the laws are framed in the main with a\n\t\t\t\t\tview to war; and also among all the non-Hellenic nations that are strong enough\n\t\t\t\t\tto expand at the expense of others, military strength has been held in honor,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example, among the Scythians, Persians, Thracians and Celts. Indeed among some peoples there are even\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain laws stimulating military valor; for instance at , we are told, warriors receive\n\t\t\t\t\tthe decoration of armlets of the same number as the campaigns on which they have\n\t\t\t\t\tserved; and at one time there was also a law in  that a man who had never killed an enemy must wear\n\t\t\t\t\this halter instead of a belt. Among Scythian tribes at a certain festival a cup\n\t\t\t\t\twas carried round from which a man that had not killed an enemy was not allowed\n\t\t\t\t\tto drink. Among the Iberians, a warlike race, they fix small spitsin the\n\t\t\t\t\tearth round a man's grave corresponding in number to the enemies he has killed.\n\t\t\t\t\tSo with other races there are many other practices of a similar kind, some\n\t\t\t\t\testablished by law and others by custom.Nevertheless those who wish\n\t\t\t\t\tto examine the matter closely might perhaps think it exceedingly strange that it\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be the business of a statesman to be able to devise means of holding\n\t\t\t\t\tempire and mastery over the neighboring peoples whether they desire it or not.\n\t\t\t\t\tHow can that be worthy of a statesman or lawgiver which is not even lawful? and\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment is not lawful when it is carried on not only justly but also\n\t\t\t\t\tunjustlyand superior strength may be unjustly exercised. Moreover we do not see this in the other\n\t\t\t\t\tsciences either: it is no part of a physician's or ship-captain's business to\n\t\t\t\t\tuse either persuasion or compulsion upon the patients in the one case and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrew in the other. Yet most peoples seem to think\n\t\t\t\t\tthat despotic rule is statesmanship, and are not ashamed to practise towards\n\t\t\t\t\tothers treatment which they declare to be unjust and detrimental for themselves;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor in their own internal affairs they demand just government, yet in their\n\t\t\t\t\trelations with other peoples they pay no attention to justice. Yet it is strange if there is not a natural\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinction between peoples suited to be despotically ruled and those not\n\t\t\t\t\tsuited; so that if this is so, it is not proper to attempt to exercise despotic\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment over all people, but only over those suited for it, just as it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tright to hunt human beings for food or sacrifice, but only the game suitable for\n\t\t\t\t\tthis purpose, that is, such wild creatures as are good to eat. And moreover it\n\t\t\t\t\tis possible even for a single state in isolation to be happy, that is\n\t\t\t\t\tone that is well governed, in as much as it is conceivable that a state might be\n\t\t\t\t\tcarried on somewhere in isolation, enjoying good laws, and in such a state the\n\t\t\t\t\tsystem of the constitution will not be framed for the purpose of war or of\n\t\t\t\t\toverpowering its enemiesfor we are to suppose everything to do with\n\t\t\t\t\twar to be excluded. It is evident\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore that while all military pursuits are to be deemed honorable, they are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot so as being the ultimate end of all things but as means to that end. And it\n\t\t\t\t\tis the business of the good lawgiver to study how a state, a race of men or any\n\t\t\t\t\tother community is to partake of the good life and the happiness possible for\n\t\t\t\t\tthem. Some however of the regulations laid down will vary; and in case there\n\t\t\t\t\texist any neighbor peoples, it is the business of the legislative art to\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider what sort of exercises should be practised in relation to what sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tneighbors or how the state is to adopt the regulations that are suitable in\n\t\t\t\t\trelation to each.But this question of the proper\n\t\t\t\t\tend for the best constitutions to aim at may receive its due consideration\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater.\n\t\t\t\t\tWe\n\t\t\t\t\tturn to those who, while agreeing that the life of virtue is the most desirable,\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffer about the way in which that life should be pursued. Some disapprove of\n\t\t\t\t\tholding office in the state, thinking that the life of the free manis different from the life of politics and\n\t\t\t\t\tis the most desirable of any; whereas others think the political life the best\n\t\t\t\t\tlife, for they argue that it is impossible for the man who does nothing to do\n\t\t\t\t\twell, and doing well and happiness are the same thing. To these two parties we must reply that both are partly\n\t\t\t\t\tright and partly wrong. The former are right in saying that the life of the free\n\t\t\t\t\tman is better than the life of mastership, for this is truethere is\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing specially dignified in employing a slave, as a slave, for giving orders\n\t\t\t\t\tabout menial duties has in it nothing of nobility; yet to think that all government is exercising the\n\t\t\t\t\tauthority of a master is a mistake, for there is as wide a difference between\n\t\t\t\t\truling free men and ruling slaves as there is between the natural freeman and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe natural slave themselves. But these things have been adequately decided in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first discourses. But\n\t\t\t\t\tto praise inaction more highly than action is an error, for happiness is an\n\t\t\t\t\tactivity, and further the actions of the just and temperate have in them the\n\t\t\t\t\trealization of much that is noble. Yet on the strength of these decisions somebody might perhaps suppose that the\n\t\t\t\t\thighest good is to be the master of the world, since thus one would have the\n\t\t\t\t\tpower to compass the greatest number and the noblest kind of actions, and\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore it is not the duty of the man that is capable of ruling to surrender\n\t\t\t\t\toffice to his neighbor, but rather to take it from him, and no account must be\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken by father of sons nor by sons of father nor in general by one friend of\n\t\t\t\t\tanother, and no heed must be paid to them in comparison with this; for the best\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is the most to be desired, and to do well is the best thing. Now this statement is perhaps true\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif it is the case that the most desirable of existing things\n\t\t\t\t\twill belong to men that use robbery and violence. But perhaps it cannot belong\n\t\t\t\t\tto them, and this is a false assumption. For a man's acts can no longer be noble\n\t\t\t\t\tif he does not excel as greatly as a man excels a woman or a father his children\n\t\t\t\t\tor a master his slaves, so that one who transgresses cannot afterwards achieve\n\t\t\t\t\tanything sufficient to rectify the lapse from virtue that he had already\n\t\t\t\t\tcommitted; because for equals the noble and just consists in their taking turns,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince this is equal and alike, but for those that are equal to have an unequal\n\t\t\t\t\tshare and those that are alike an unlike share is contrary to nature, and\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing contrary to nature is noble. Hence in case there is another person who\n\t\t\t\t\tis our superior in virtue and in practical capacity for the highest functions,\n\t\t\t\t\thim it is noble to follow and him it is just to obey; though he must possess not\n\t\t\t\t\tonly virtue but also capacity that will render him capable of action. But if these things are well said, and if\n\t\t\t\t\thappiness is to be defined as well-doing, the active life is the best life both\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the whole state collectively and for each man individually. But the active\n\t\t\t\t\tlife is not necessarily active in relation to other men, as some people think,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor are only those processes of thought active that are pursued for the sake of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe objects that result from action, but far morethose speculations and thoughts that have their end in\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves and are pursued for their own sake; for the end is to do well, and\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore is a certain form of action. And even with actions done in relation to\n\t\t\t\t\texternal objects we predicate action in the full sense chiefly of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmaster-craftsmen who direct the action by their thoughts. Moreover with cities also, those that occupy an\n\t\t\t\t\tisolated situation and pursue a policy of isolation are not necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\tinactive; for state activities also can be sectional, since the sections of the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate have many common relations with one another. And this is also possible\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly in the case of any individual human being; for otherwise God and the\n\t\t\t\t\twhole universe could hardly be well circumstanced, since they have no external\n\t\t\t\t\tactivities by the side of their own private activities.It is therefore manifest that the same life must be the best\n\t\t\t\t\tboth for each human being individually and for states and mankind\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollectively.And as we have prepared the way by this prefatory discussion of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subject, and have previously studied all the other forms of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, the starting-point for the remainder of our subject is\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst to specify the nature of the conditions that are necessary in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe state that is to be constituted in the ideally best manner. For the best\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution cannot be realized without suitable equipment. We must therefore posit as granted in\n\t\t\t\t\tadvance a number of as it were ideal conditions, although none of these must be\n\t\t\t\t\tactually impossible. I mean for instance in reference to number of citizens and\n\t\t\t\t\tterritory. All other craftsmen, for\n\t\t\t\t\texample a weaver or a shipwright, have to be supplied with their\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterial in a condition suitable for their trade, for the better this material\n\t\t\t\t\thas been prepared, the finer is bound to be the product of their craft; so also\n\t\t\t\t\tthe statesman and the lawgiver ought to be furnished with their proper material\n\t\t\t\t\tin a suitable condition. Under the head of material equipment for the state\n\t\t\t\t\tthere first come the questions as to a supply of populationwhat\n\t\t\t\t\tprecisely ought to be its number and what its natural character? and similarly\n\t\t\t\t\tin regard to the territory, what is to be its particular size and nature?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost people imagine that the\n\t\t\t\t\tprosperous state must be a great state; but granted the truth of this, they fail\n\t\t\t\t\tto realize in what quality the greatness or smallness of a state consists: they\n\t\t\t\t\tjudge a great state by the numerical magnitude of the population, but really the\n\t\t\t\t\tmore proper thing to look at is not numbers but efficiency. For a state like\n\t\t\t\t\tother things has a certain function to perform, so that it is the state most\n\t\t\t\t\tcapable of performing this function that is to be deemed the greatest, just as\n\t\t\t\t\tone would pronounce Hippocrates to be greater, not as a human being but as a\n\t\t\t\t\tphysician, than somebody who surpassed him in bodily size. All the same, even if it be right to judge the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate by the test of its multitude, this ought not to be done with regard to the\n\t\t\t\t\tmultitude of any and every class for states are doubtless bound to\n\t\t\t\t\tcontain a large number of slavesand\n\t\t\t\t\tresident aliens and foreigners, but the test should be the number of\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who are a part of the statethe special parts of which a state\n\t\t\t\t\tconsists. It is superiority in the number of these that indicates a great state;\n\t\t\t\t\ta state that sends forth to war a large number of the baser sort and a small\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of heavy-armed soldiers cannot possibly be a great statefor a\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat state is not the same thing as a state with a large population. But certainly experience also shows that it\n\t\t\t\t\tis difficult and perhaps impossible for a state with too large a population to\n\t\t\t\t\thave good legal government. At all events we see that none of the states reputed\n\t\t\t\t\tto be well governed is without some restriction in regard to numbers. The\n\t\t\t\t\tevidence of theory proves the same point. Law is a form of order, and good law\n\t\t\t\t\tmust necessarily mean good order; but an excessively large number cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipate in order: to give it order would surely be a task for divine power,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich holds even this universe together. Hence that state also must\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily be the most beautiful with whose magnitude is combined the\n\t\t\t\t\tabove-mentioned limiting principle; for certainly beauty is usually found in number and magnitude, but there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdue measure of magnitude for a city-state as there also is for all other\n\t\t\t\t\tthingsanimals, plants, tools; each of these if too small or\n\t\t\t\t\texcessively large will not possess its own proper efficiency, but in some cases\n\t\t\t\t\twill have entirely lost its true nature and in others will be in a defective\n\t\t\t\t\tcondition: for instance, a ship a span long will not be a ship at all, nor will\n\t\t\t\t\ta ship a quarter of a mile long, and even when it reaches a certain size,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin some cases smallness and in others excessive largeness will\n\t\t\t\t\tmake it sail badly. Similarly a\n\t\t\t\t\tstate consisting of too few people will not be self-sufficing which is\n\t\t\t\t\tan essential quality of a state, and one consisting of too many,\n\t\t\t\t\tthough self-sufficing in the mere necessaries, will be so in the way in which a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnation is, and not as a state, since it\n\t\t\t\t\twill not be easy for it to possess constitutional governmentfor who\n\t\t\t\t\twill command its over-swollen multitude in war? or who will serve as its herald,\n\t\t\t\t\tunless he have the lungs of a Stentor? It follows that the lowest limit for the\n\t\t\t\t\texistence of a state is when it consists of a population that reaches the\n\t\t\t\t\tminimum number that is self-sufficient for the purpose of living the good life\n\t\t\t\t\tafter the manner of a political community. It is possible also for one that\n\t\t\t\t\texceeds this one in number to be a greater state, but, as we said, this\n\t\t\t\t\tpossibility of increase is not without limit, and what the limit of the state's\n\t\t\t\t\texpansion is can easily be seen from practical considerations. The activities of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe state are those of the rulers and those of the persons ruled, and the work\n\t\t\t\t\tof a ruler is to direct the administration and to judge law-suits; but in order\n\t\t\t\t\tto decide questions of justice and in order to distribute the offices according\n\t\t\t\t\tto merit it is necessary for the citizens to know each other's personal\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacters, since where this does not happen to be the case the business of\n\t\t\t\t\telecting officials and trying law-suits is bound to go badly; haphazard decision\n\t\t\t\t\tis unjust in both matters, and thismust obviously prevail in an excessively numerous community. Also in such a community it is easy for\n\t\t\t\t\tforeigners and resident aliens to usurp the rights of citizenship, for the\n\t\t\t\t\texcessive number of the population makes it not difficult to escape detection.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is clear therefore that the best limiting principle for a state is the\n\t\t\t\t\tlargest expansion of the population, with a view to self-sufficiency that can\n\t\t\t\t\twell be taken in at one view.Such may be our\n\t\t\t\t\tconclusion on the question of the size of the state.Very much the same holds\n\t\t\t\t\tgood about its territory. As to the question what particular kind of land it\n\t\t\t\t\tought to have, it is clear that everybody would command that which is most\n\t\t\t\t\tself-sufficing and such is necessarily that which bears every sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tproduce, for self-sufficiency means having a supply of everything and lacking\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing. In extent and magnitude the land ought to be of a size that\n\t\t\t\t\twill enable the inhabitants to live a life of liberal and at the same time\n\t\t\t\t\ttemperate leisure. Whether this limiting principle is rightly or wrongly stated\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be considered more precisely later on,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen we come to raise the general subject of property and the ownership of\n\t\t\t\t\twealth,how and in what way it ought to be related to the employment\n\t\t\t\t\tof wealth; about this question there are\n\t\t\t\t\tmany controversies, owing to those that draw us towards either extreme of life,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe one school towards parsimony and the other towards luxury. The proper configuration of the country it\n\t\t\t\t\tis not difficult to state though there are some points on which the\n\t\t\t\t\tadvice of military experts also must be taken: on the one hand it\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be difficult for enemies to invade and easy for the people themselves to\n\t\t\t\t\tmarch out from, and in addition, on the other hand, the same thing\n\t\t\t\t\tholds good of the territory that we said about the size of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpopulationit must be well able to be taken in at one view, and that\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans being a country easy for military defence. As to the site of the city, if\n\t\t\t\t\tit is to be ideally placed, it is proper for it to be well situated with regard\n\t\t\t\t\tboth to the sea and to the country. One defining principle is that mentioned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabovethe city must be in communication with all parts of the\n\t\t\t\t\tterritory for the purpose of sending out military assistance; and the remaining\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple is that it must be easily accessible for the conveyance to it of the\n\t\t\t\t\tagricultural produce, and also of timber-wood and any other such material that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe country happens to possess.As to communication with the sea it is in\n\t\t\t\t\tfact much debated whether it is advantageous to well-ordered states or harmful.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is maintained that the visits of persons brought up under other institutions\n\t\t\t\t\tare detrimental to law and order, and so also is a swollen population, which\n\t\t\t\t\tgrows out of sending out abroad and receiving in a number of traders, but is\n\t\t\t\t\tunfavorable to good government. Now\n\t\t\t\t\tit is not difficult to see that, if these consequences are avoided, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantageous in respect of both security and the supply of necessary\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommoditiesthat the city and the\n\t\t\t\t\tcountry should have access to the sea. With a view to enduring wars more easily\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople that are to be secure must be capable of defensive operations on both\n\t\t\t\t\telements, land and sea, and with a view to striking at assailants, even if it be\n\t\t\t\t\tnot possible on both elements, yet to do so on one or the other will be more in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe power of people that have access to both. And the importation of commodities\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they do not happen to have in their own country and the export of their\n\t\t\t\t\tsurplus products are things indispensable; for the state ought to engage in\n\t\t\t\t\tcommerce for its own interest, but not for the interest of the foreigner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPeople that throw open their\n\t\t\t\t\tmarket to the world do so for the sake of revenue, but a state that is not to\n\t\t\t\t\ttake part in that sort of profit-making need not possess a great commercial\n\t\t\t\t\tport. But since even now we see many countries and cities possessing sea-ports\n\t\t\t\t\tand harbors conveniently situated with regard to the city, so as not to form\n\t\t\t\t\tpart of the same town and yet not to be too far off, but commanded by\n\t\t\t\t\twalls and other defence-works of the kind, it is manifest that if any advantage\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes result through the communication of city with port the state will possess\n\t\t\t\t\tthis advantage, and if there is any harmful result it is easy to guard against\n\t\t\t\t\tit by means of laws stating and regulating what persons are not and what persons\n\t\t\t\t\tare to have intercourse with one another. On the question of naval forces, there is no doubt that to\n\t\t\t\t\tpossess them up to a certain strength is most desirable for a\n\t\t\t\t\tstate ought to be formidable, and also capable of the defence of not only its\n\t\t\t\t\town people but also some of its neighbors, by sea as well as by land;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut when we come to the question of the number and size of this force, we have\n\t\t\t\t\tto consider the state's manner of life if it is to live a life of leadership and\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffairs, it must possess maritime as well as other forces\n\t\t\t\t\tcommensurate with its activities. On\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other hand it is not necessary for states to include the teeming population\n\t\t\t\t\tthat grows up in connection with common sailors, as there is no need for these\n\t\t\t\t\tto be citizens; for the marines are free men and are a part of the infantry, and\n\t\t\t\t\tit is they who have command and control the crew; and if there exists a mass of\n\t\t\t\t\tvillagers and tillers of the soil, there is bound to be no lack of sailors too.\n\t\t\t\t\tIn fact we see this state of thing existing even now in some places, for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance in the city of ; the\n\t\t\t\t\tHeracleotes man a large fleet of triremes, although they possess a city of but\n\t\t\t\t\tmoderate size as compared with others.Let such\n\t\t\t\t\tthen be our conclusions about the territories and harbors of cities, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tsea, and about naval forces.About the citizen population, we said\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore what is its proper limit of numbers. Let us now speakof what ought to be the citizens' natural\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter. Now this one might almost discern by looking at the famous cities of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t and by observing how the\n\t\t\t\t\twhole inhabited world is divided up among the nations. The nations inhabiting the cold places and\n\t\t\t\t\tthose of  are full of spirit but\n\t\t\t\t\tsomewhat deficient in intelligence and skill, so that they continue\n\t\t\t\t\tcomparatively free, but lacking in political organization and capacity to rule\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir neighbors. The peoples of  on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other hand are intelligent and skillful in temperament, but lack spirit, so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they are in continuous subjection and slavery. But the Greek race\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipates in both characters, just as it occupies the middle position\n\t\t\t\t\tgeographically, for it is both spirited and intelligent; hence it continues to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe free and to have very good political institutions, and to be capable of\n\t\t\t\t\truling all mankind if it attains constitutional unity. The same diversity also exists among the Greek races\n\t\t\t\t\tcompared with one another: some have a one-sided nature, others are happily\n\t\t\t\t\tblended in regard to both these capacities. It is clear therefore that people that are to be\n\t\t\t\t\teasily guided to virtue by the lawgiver must be both intellectual and spirited\n\t\t\t\t\tin their nature. For as to what is said by certain persons about the character\n\t\t\t\t\tthat should belong to their Guardiansthey should be affectionate to their\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends but fierce towards strangersit is spirit that causes\n\t\t\t\t\taffectionateness, for spirit is the capacity of the soul whereby we love.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA sign of this is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat spirit is more roused against associates and friends than against\n\t\t\t\t\tstrangers, when it thinks itself slighted. Therefore Archilochus for instance,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen reproaching his friends, appropriately apostrophizes his spirit:  Moreover it is from this faculty that power to command and love of\n\t\t\t\t\tfreedom are in all cases derived; for spirit is a commanding and indomitable\n\t\t\t\t\telement. But it is a mistake to describe the Guardians as cruel towards\n\t\t\t\t\tstrangers; it is not right to be cruel towards anybody, and men of great-souled\n\t\t\t\t\tnature are not fierce except towards wrongdoers, and their anger is still\n\t\t\t\t\tfiercer against their companions if they think that these are wronging them, as\n\t\t\t\t\thas been said before. And this is\n\t\t\t\t\treasonable, because they think that in addition to the harm done them they are\n\t\t\t\t\talso being defrauded of a benefit by persons whom they believe to owe them one.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence the sayings  and \n\t\t\t\t\tWe have now approximately decided what are the\n\t\t\t\t\tproper numbers and the natural qualities of those who exercise the right of\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens, and the proper extent and nature of the territory for we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust notseek to attain the same\n\t\t\t\t\texactness by means of theoretical discussions as is obtained by means of the\n\t\t\t\t\tfacts that come to us through sense-perceptions.But since, just as\n\t\t\t\t\twith all other natural organisms those things that are indispensable for the\n\t\t\t\t\texistence of the whole are not parts of the whole organization,\n\t\t\t\t\tit is also clear that not all the things that are necessary for states to\n\t\t\t\t\tpossess are to be counted as parts of a state any more than this is so\n\t\t\t\t\twith any other association that forms something one in kind, for there must be\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething that is one and common and the same for the partners, whether the\n\t\t\t\t\tshares that they take be equal or unequal: for example this common property may\n\t\t\t\t\tbe food or an area of land or something else of the same sort\n\t\t\t\t\tbut when of two related things one\n\t\t\t\t\tis a means and the other an end, in their case there is nothing in common except\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the one to act and the other to receive the action. I mean for instance the\n\t\t\t\t\trelation between any instrument or artificer and the work that they produce:\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween a house and a builder there is nothing that is produced in common, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe builder's craft exists for the sake of the house. Hence although states need\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty, the property is no part of the state. And there are many living things\n\t\t\t\t\tthat fall under the head of property. And the state is one\n\t\t\t\t\tform of partnership of similar people, and its object is the best life that is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible. And since the greatest\n\t\t\t\t\tgood is happiness, and this is some perfect activity or employment of virtue,\n\t\t\t\t\tand since it has so come about that it is possible for some men to participate\n\t\t\t\t\tin it, but for others only to a small extent or not at all, it is clear that\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is the cause for there arising different kinds and varieties of state and\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral forms of constitution; for as each set of people pursues\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipation in happiness in a different manner and by different means they\n\t\t\t\t\tmake for themselves different modes of life and different constitutions. And we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust also further consider how many there are of these things referred to that\n\t\t\t\t\tare indispensable for the existence of a state; for among them will be the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which we pronounce to be parts of a state, owing to which their presence\n\t\t\t\t\tis essential. We must therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider the list of occupations that a state requires : for from these it will\n\t\t\t\t\tappear what the indispensable classes are. First then a state must have a supply\n\t\t\t\t\tof food; secondly, handicrafts since life needs many tools;\n\t\t\t\t\tthird, arms since the members of the association must necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\tpossess arms both to use among themselves and for purposes of government, in\n\t\t\t\t\tcases of insubordination, and to employ against those who try to molest them\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom without; also a certain abundance of money, in order that they\n\t\t\t\t\tmay have enough both for their internal needs and for requirements of war;\n\t\t\t\t\tfifth, a primary need, the service of religion, termed a priesthood; and sixth\n\t\t\t\t\tin number and most necessary of all, a provision for deciding questions of\n\t\t\t\t\tinterests and of rights between the citizens. These then are the occupations that virtually every state\n\t\t\t\t\trequires for the state is not any chance multitude of people but one\n\t\t\t\t\tself-sufficient for the needs of life, as we say, and if any of these\n\t\t\t\t\tindustries happens to be wanting, it is impossible for that association to be\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely self-sufficient. It is necessary therefore for the state to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe organizedon the lines of these\n\t\t\t\t\tfunctions; consequently it must possess a number of farmers who will provide the\n\t\t\t\t\tfood, and craftsmen, and the military class, and the wealthy, and priests and\n\t\t\t\t\tjudges to decide questions of necessity and of interests.These matters having been\n\t\t\t\t\tsettled, it remains to consider whether everybody is to take part in all of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese functions for it is possible for the whole of the people to be\n\t\t\t\t\tat once farmers and craftsmen and the councillors and judges, or\n\t\t\t\t\twhether we are to assume different classes corresponding to each of the\n\t\t\t\t\tfunctions mentioned, or whether some of them must necessarily be specialized and\n\t\t\t\t\tothers combined. But it will not be the same in every form of constitution; for,\n\t\t\t\t\tas we said, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible either for all the people to take part in all the functions or for not\n\t\t\t\t\tall to take part in all but for certain people to have certain functions. In\n\t\t\t\t\tfact these different distributions of functions are the cause of the difference\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween constitutions: democracies are states in which all the people\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipate in all the functions, oligarchies where the contrary is the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut at present we are studying\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best constitution, and this is the constitution under which the state would\n\t\t\t\t\tbe most happy, and it has been stated before that happiness cannot be forthcoming without virtue; it is\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore clear from these considerations that in the most nobly constituted\n\t\t\t\t\tstate, and the one that possesses men that are absolutely just, not merely just\n\t\t\t\t\trelatively to the principle that is the basis of the constitution, the citizens\n\t\t\t\t\tmust not live a mechanic or a mercantile life for such a life is\n\t\t\t\t\tignoble and inimical to virtue, nor yet must those who are to be\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens in the best state be tillers of the soil for\n\t\t\t\t\tleisure is needed both for the development of virtue and for active\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipation in politics. And since the state also contains the military class and the class that\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberates about matters of policy and judges questions of justice, and these\n\t\t\t\t\tare manifestly in a special sense parts of the state, are these classes also to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe set down as distinct or are both functions to be assigned to the same\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons? But here also the answer is clear, because in a certain sense they\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be assigned to the same persons, but in a certain sense to different\n\t\t\t\t\tones. Inasmuch as each of these two functions belongs to a different prime of\n\t\t\t\t\tlife, and one requires wisdom, the other strength, they are to be assigned to\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent people; but inasmuch as it is a thing impossible that when a set of\n\t\t\t\t\tmen are able to employ force and to resist control, these should submit always\n\t\t\t\t\tto be ruled, from this point of view both functions must be assigned to the same\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople; for those who have the power of arms have the power to decide whether\n\t\t\t\t\tthe constitution shall stand or fall. The only course left them is to assign this constitutional function to both\n\t\t\t\t\tsets of men without distinction, yet not simultaneously, but,\n\t\t\t\t\tas in the natural order of things strength is found in the younger men and\n\t\t\t\t\twisdom in the elder, it seems to be expedient and just for their functions to be\n\t\t\t\t\tallotted to both in this way, for this mode of division possesses conformity\n\t\t\t\t\twith merit. Moreover the ownership\n\t\t\t\t\tof properties also must be centered round these classes, for the citizens must\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily possess plentiful means, and these are the citizens. For\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheartisan class has no share in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe state, nor has any other class that is not an artificer of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvirtue. And this is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear from our basic principle; for in conjunction with virtue happiness is\n\t\t\t\t\tbound to be forthcoming, but we should pronounce a state happy having regard not\n\t\t\t\t\tto a particular section of it but to all its citizens. And it is also manifest\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the properties must belong to these classes, inasmuch as it is necessary for the tillers of the soil to be slaves, or\n\t\t\t\t\tserfs of alien race. There remains\n\t\t\t\t\tof the list enumerated the class of priests; and the position of this class also\n\t\t\t\t\tis manifest. Priests must be appointed neither from the tillers of the soil nor\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the artisans, for it is seemly that the gods should be worshipped by\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizens; and since the citizen body is divided into two parts, the military\n\t\t\t\t\tclass and the councillor class, and as it is seemly that those who have\n\t\t\t\t\trelinquished these duties owing to age should render to the gods their due\n\t\t\t\t\tworship and should spend their retirement in their service, it is to these that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe priestly offices should be assigned.We have\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore stated the things indispensable for the constitution of a state, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe things that are parts of a state: tillers of the soil, craftsmen and the\n\t\t\t\t\tlaboring class generally are a necessary appurtenance of states, but the\n\t\t\t\t\tmilitary and deliberative classes are parts of the state; and moreover each of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese divisions is separate from the others, either permanently or by turn.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is proper for the state to be divided up into castes and for the\n\t\t\t\t\tmilitary class to be distinct from that of the tillers of the soil does not\n\t\t\t\t\tseem to be a discovery of political philosophers of today or one made\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecently. In  this arrangement still exists even now,\n\t\t\t\t\tas also in ; it is said to have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen established in  by the\n\t\t\t\t\tlegislation of Sesostris and in \n\t\t\t\t\tby that of Minos. Common meals also\n\t\t\t\t\tseem to be an ancient institution, those in  having begun in the reign of Minos, while those in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t are much older than these.\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the historians one of the settlers there, a certain Italus, became\n\t\t\t\t\tking of Oenotria, and from him they took the name of Italians instead of that of\n\t\t\t\t\tOenotrians, and the name of Italy was given to all that promontory of  lying\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween the Gulfs of Scylletium and of Lametus, which are half a day's\n\t\t\t\t\tjourney apart. It was this Italus\n\t\t\t\t\tthen who according to tradition converted the Oenotrians from a pastoral life to\n\t\t\t\t\tone of agriculture and gave them various ordinances, being the first to\n\t\t\t\t\tinstitute their system of common meals; hence the common meals and some of his\n\t\t\t\t\tlaws are still observed by certain of his successors even today. The settlers in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe direction of Tyrrhenia were Opicans, who today as in former times\n\t\t\t\t\tbear the surname ofAusonians; the\n\t\t\t\t\tregion towards Iapygia and the Ionian Gulf, called Syrtis, was\n\t\t\t\t\tinhabited by the Chones, who also were Oenotrians by race. It is from this country that the system of common\n\t\t\t\t\tmeals has its origin, while the division of the citizen-body by hereditary caste\n\t\t\t\t\tcame from , for the reign of\n\t\t\t\t\tSesostris long antedates that of Minos. We may almost take it therefore that all\n\t\t\t\t\tother political devices also have been discovered repeatedly, or rather an\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite number of times over, in the lapse of ages; for the discoveries of a\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary kind are probably taught by need itself, and when the necessaries have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen provided it is reasonable that things contributing to refinement and luxury\n\t\t\t\t\tshould find their development; so that we must assume that this is the way with\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical institutions also. The\n\t\t\t\t\tantiquity of all of them is indicated by the history of ; for the Egyptians are reputed to be the\n\t\t\t\t\toldest of nations, but they have always had laws and a political system. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\twe should use the results of previous discovery when adequate, while endeavoring\n\t\t\t\t\tto investigate matters hitherto passed over.It\n\t\t\t\t\thas been stated before that the land ought to be owned by those who possess arms\n\t\t\t\t\tand those who share the rights of the constitution, and why the cultivators\n\t\t\t\t\tought to be a different caste from these, and what is the proper extent and\n\t\t\t\t\tconformation of the country. We have\n\t\t\t\t\tnow to discuss first the allotment of the land, and the proper class and\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter of its cultivators; since we advocate not common ownership of land, as\n\t\t\t\t\tsome have done, but community in it brought about in a friendly way\n\t\t\t\t\tby the use of it, and we hold that no\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen should be ill supplied with means of subsistence. As to common meals,\n\t\t\t\t\tall agree that this is an institution advantageous for well-organized states to\n\t\t\t\t\tpossess; our own reasons for sharing this view we will state later. But the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon meals must be shared by all the citizens, and it is not easy for the poor\n\t\t\t\t\tto contribute their assessed share from their private means and also to maintain\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir household as well. And\n\t\t\t\t\tmoreover the expenses connected with religion are the common concern of the\n\t\t\t\t\twhole state. It is necessary therefore for the land to be divided into two\n\t\t\t\t\tparts, of which one must be common and the other the private property of\n\t\t\t\t\tindividuals; and each of these two divisions must again be divided in two. Of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe common land one portion should be assigned to the services of religion, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other to defray the cost of the common meals; of the land in private\n\t\t\t\t\townership one part should be the district near the frontiers, and another the\n\t\t\t\t\tdistrict near the city, in order that two plots may be assigned to each citizen\n\t\t\t\t\tand all may have a share in both districts. This arrangement satisfies equity and justice, and also\n\t\t\t\t\tconduces to greater unanimity in facing border warfare. Where this system is not\n\t\t\t\t\tfollowed, one set of people are reckless about quarrelling with the neighboring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstates,and the other set are too\n\t\t\t\t\tcautious and neglect considerations of honor. Hence some people have a law that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe citizens whose land is near the frontier are not to take part in\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberation as to wars against neighboring states, on the ground that private\n\t\t\t\t\tinterest would prevent them from being able to take counsel wisely. The land\n\t\t\t\t\tmust therefore be divided up in this manner because of the reasons\n\t\t\t\t\t\taforesaid.Those who are to cultivate the soil should best of all, if the\n\t\t\t\t\tideal system is to be stated, be slaves, not drawn from people all of one tribe\n\t\t\t\t\tnor of a spirited character for thus they would be both serviceable\n\t\t\t\t\tfor their work and safe to abstain from insurrection, but as a second\n\t\t\t\t\tbest they should be alien serfs of a similar nature. Of these laborers those in\n\t\t\t\t\tprivate employment must be among the private possessions of the owners of the\n\t\t\t\t\testates, and those working on the common land common property. How slaves should\n\t\t\t\t\tbe employed, and why it is advantageous that all slaves should have their\n\t\t\t\t\tfreedom set before them as a reward, we will say later.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt\n\t\t\t\t\thas been said before that the city should so far as circumstances permit be in\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunication alike with the mainland, the sea and the whole of its territory.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe site of the city itself we must pray that fortune may place on sloping\n\t\t\t\t\tground, having regard to four considerations: first, as a thing essential, the consideration of\n\t\t\t\t\thealth for cities whose site slopes east or towards the breezes that\n\t\t\t\t\tblow from the sunrise are more healthy, and in the second degree those that face\n\t\t\t\t\taway from the north wind,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor these are milder in winter; and among the remaining considerations, a sloping site is\n\t\t\t\t\tfavorable both for political and for military purposes. For military purposes\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore the site should be easy of exit for the citizens themselves, and\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult for the adversary to approach and to blockade, and it must possess if\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible a plentiful natural supply of pools and springs, but failing this, a\n\t\t\t\t\tmode has been invented of supplying water by means of constructing an abundance\n\t\t\t\t\tof large reservoirs for rain-water, so that a supply may never fail the citizens\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they are debarred from their territory by war. And since we have to consider the health of the\n\t\t\t\t\tinhabitants, and this depends upon the place being well situated both on healthy\n\t\t\t\t\tground and with a healthy aspect, and secondly upon using wholesome\n\t\t\t\t\twater-supplies, the following matter also must be attended to as of primary\n\t\t\t\t\timportance. Those things which we use for the body in the largest quantity, and\n\t\t\t\t\tmost frequently, contribute most to health; and the influence of the\n\t\t\t\t\twater-supply and of the air is of this nature. Hence in wise cities if all the\n\t\t\t\t\tsources of water are not equally pure and there is not an abundance of suitable\n\t\t\t\t\tsprings, the water-supplies for drinking must be kept separate from those for\n\t\t\t\t\tother requirements. As to fortified\n\t\t\t\t\tpositions, what is expedient is not the same for all forms of constitution\n\t\t\t\t\talike; for example, a citadel-hill is suitable for oligarchy and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonarchy,and a level site for\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy; neither is favorable to an aristocracy, but rather several strong\n\t\t\t\t\tpositions. The arrangement of the private dwellings is thought to be more\n\t\t\t\t\tagreeable and more convenient for general purposes if they are laid out in\n\t\t\t\t\tstraight streets, after the modern fashion, that is, the one introduced by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHippodamus; but it\n\t\t\t\t\tis more suitable for security in war if it is on the contrary plan, as cities\n\t\t\t\t\tused to be in ancient times; for that arrangement is difficult for foreign\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroops to enter and to find their way\n\t\t\t\t\tabout in when attacking. Hence it\n\t\t\t\t\tis well to combine the advantages of both plans for this is possible\n\t\t\t\t\tif the houses are laid out in the way which among the farmers some people call\n\t\t\t\t\ton the slant in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tvines, and not to lay out the whole city in straight streets, but only\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain parts and districts, for in this way it will combine security with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeauty.As regards walls, those who aver that\n\t\t\t\t\tcities which pretend to valor should not have them hold too old-fashioned a\n\t\t\t\t\tviewand that though they see that the cities that indulge in that\n\t\t\t\t\tform of vanity are refuted by experience. It is true that against an evenly matched foe and one\n\t\t\t\t\tlittle superior in numbers it is not honorable to try to secure oneself by the\n\t\t\t\t\tstrength of one's fortifications; but as it does and may happen that the\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperior numbers of the attackers may be too much for the human valor of a small\n\t\t\t\t\tforce, if the city is to survive and not to suffer disaster or insult, the\n\t\t\t\t\tsecurest fortification of walls must be deemed to be the most warlike,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in view of the inventions that have now been made\n\t\t\t\t\tin the direction of precision with missiles and artillery for sieges. To claim not to encompass cities with\n\t\t\t\t\twalls is like desiring the country to be easy\n\t\t\t\t\tto invade and stripping it of hilly regions, and similarly not surrounding even\n\t\t\t\t\tprivate dwellings with house-walls on the ground that the inhabitants will be\n\t\t\t\t\tcowardly. Another point moreover that must not be forgotten is that those who\n\t\t\t\t\thave walls round the city can use their cities in both ways, both as walled\n\t\t\t\t\tcities and as open ones, whereas cities not possessing walls cannot be used in\n\t\t\t\t\tboth ways. If then this is so, not\n\t\t\t\t\tonly must walls be put round a city, but also attention must be paid to them in\n\t\t\t\t\torder that they may be suitable both in regard to the adornment of the city and\n\t\t\t\t\tin respect of military requirements, especially the new devices recently\n\t\t\t\t\tinvented. For just as the attackers of a city are concerned to study the means\n\t\t\t\t\tby which they can gain the advantage, so also for the defenders some devices\n\t\t\t\t\thave already been invented and others they must discover and think out; for\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople do not even start attempting to attack those who are well\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprepared.And since the multitude of citizens\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be distributedin separate\n\t\t\t\t\tmesses, and the city walls must be divided up by guard-posts and towers in\n\t\t\t\t\tsuitable places, it is clear that these facts themselves call for some of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmesses to be organized at these guard-posts. These things then might be arranged\n\t\t\t\t\tin this manner. But it is fitting\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the dwellings assigned to the gods and the most important of the official\n\t\t\t\t\tmesses should have a suitable site, and the same for all, excepting those\n\t\t\t\t\ttemples which are assigned a special place apart by the law or else by some\n\t\t\t\t\tutterance of the Pythian oracle. And the site would be suitable if it is one\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is sufficiently conspicuous in regard to the excellence of its position,\n\t\t\t\t\tand also of superior strength in regard to the adjacent parts of the city.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is convenient that below\n\t\t\t\t\tthis site should be laid out an agora of the kind customary in  which they call a free agora, that\n\t\t\t\t\tis, one which has to be kept clear of all merchandise and into which no artisan\n\t\t\t\t\tor farmer or any other such person may intrude unless summoned by the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates. It would give amenity to the site if the gymnasia of the older men\n\t\t\t\t\twere also situated herefor it is proper to have this institution also\n\t\t\t\t\tdivided according to ages, and for certain magistrates to pass their\n\t\t\t\t\ttime among the youths while the older men spend theirs with the magistrates; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe presence of the magistrates before men's eyes most engenders true respect\n\t\t\t\t\tand a freeman's awe. The agora for merchandise must be different from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe free agora, and in another place; it must have a site convenient for the\n\t\t\t\t\tcollection there of all the goods sent from the seaport and from the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd as the divisions of the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate's populace include priests\n\t\t\t\t\tand magistrates, it is suitable that the priests' mess-rooms also should have\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir position round that of the sacred buildings. And all the magistracies that\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperintend contracts, and the registration of actions at law, summonses and\n\t\t\t\t\tother such matters of administration, and also those that deal with the control\n\t\t\t\t\tof the markets and with what is termed policing the city, should have buildings\n\t\t\t\t\tadjacent to an agora or some public place of resort, and such a place is the\n\t\t\t\t\tneighborhood of the business agora, for we assign the upper agora as the place\n\t\t\t\t\tin which to spend leisure, and this one for necessary business.The\n\t\t\t\t\tarrangements in the country also should copy the plan described; there too the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates called in some states Wardens of the Woods and in others\n\t\t\t\t\tLand-superintendents must have their guard-posts and mess-rooms for patrol duty,\n\t\t\t\t\tand also temples must be distributed over the country, some dedicated to gods\n\t\t\t\t\tand some to heroes. But to linger at this point over the detailed statement and\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussion of questions of this kind is waste of time.The difficulty with such things is not so much in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe matter of theory but in that of practice; to lay down principles is a work\n\t\t\t\t\tof aspiration, but their realization is the task of fortune. Hence we will\n\t\t\t\t\trelinquish for the present the further consideration of matters of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsort.We must now discuss the constitution itself, and ask what and\n\t\t\t\t\tof what character should be the components of the state that is to have felicity\n\t\t\t\t\tand good government. There are two things in which the welfare of all men\n\t\t\t\t\tconsists: one of these is the correct establishment of the aim and end of their\n\t\t\t\t\tactions, the other the ascertainment of the actions leading to that end.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the end proposed and the means adopted may be inconsistent with\n\t\t\t\t\tone another, as also they may be consistent; sometimes the aim has been\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrectly proposed, but people fail to achieve it in action, sometimes they\n\t\t\t\t\tachieve all the means successfully but the end that they posited was a bad one,\n\t\t\t\t\tand sometimes they err as to bothfor instance, in medicine\n\t\t\t\t\tpractitioners are sometimes both wrong in their judgement of what qualities a\n\t\t\t\t\thealthy body ought to possess and unsuccessful in hitting on effective means to\n\t\t\t\t\tproduce the distinctive aim that they have set before them; whereas in the arts\n\t\t\t\t\tand sciences both these things have to be secured, the end and the practical\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans to the end. Now it\n\t\t\t\t\tis clear that all men aim at the good life and at happiness, but though some\n\t\t\t\t\tpossess the power to attain these things, some do not, owing to some factor of\n\t\t\t\t\tfortune or of nature fortune because the good life needs also a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain equipment of means, and although it needs less of this for men of\n\t\t\t\t\tbetter natural disposition it needs more for those of worse; while\n\t\t\t\t\tothers, although they have the power, go wrong at the start in their search for\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappiness. But the\n\t\t\t\t\tobject before us is to discern the best constitution, and this is the one under\n\t\t\t\t\twhich a state will be best governed, and a state will be best governed under the\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution under which it has the most opportunity for happiness; it is\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore clear that we must know what happiness is. The view that we maintain and this is the\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition that we laid down in the, if those discourses are of any value is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat happiness is the complete activity and employment of virtue, and this not\n\t\t\t\t\tconditionally but absolutely. When I say conditionally I\n\t\t\t\t\trefer to things necessary, by absolutely I mean\n\t\t\t\t\tnobly: for instance, to take the case of just actions,\n\t\t\t\t\tjust acts of vengeance and of punishment spring it is true from virtue, but are\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary, and have the quality of nobility only in a limited manner\n\t\t\t\t\tsince it would be preferable that neither individual nor state should\n\t\t\t\t\thave any need of such things, whereas actions aiming at honors and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresources are the noblest actions\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely; for the former class of acts consist in the removal of something evil, but\n\t\t\t\t\tactions of the latter kind are the oppositethey are the foundation\n\t\t\t\t\tand the generation of things good. The virtuous man will use even poverty, disease, andthe other forms of bad fortune in a noble manner,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut felicity consists in their opposites for it is a definition\n\t\t\t\t\testablished by our ethical discourses that the virtuous man is the man of such a character that because of his\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue things absolutely good are good to him, and it is therefore clear that\n\t\t\t\t\this employment of these goods must also be virtuous and noble\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely; and hence men actually suppose that external goods are the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of happiness, just as if they were to assign the cause of a brilliantly\n\t\t\t\t\tfine performance on the harp to the instrument rather than to the skill of the\n\t\t\t\t\tplayer. It follows therefore from what has been said that some goods must be\n\t\t\t\t\tforthcoming to start with and others must be provided by the legislator.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHence we pray that the\n\t\t\t\t\torganization of the state may be successful in securing those goods which are in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe control of fortune for that fortune does control external goods we\n\t\t\t\t\ttake as axiomatic; but when we come to the state's being virtuous, to\n\t\t\t\t\tsecure this is not the function of fortune but of science and policy. But then\n\t\t\t\t\tthe virtue of the state is of course caused by the citizens who share in its\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment being virtuous; and in our state all the citizens share in the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment. The point we have to consider therefore is, how does a man become\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtuous? For even if it be possible for the citizens to be virtuous\n\t\t\t\t\tcollectively without being so individually, the latter is preferable, since for\n\t\t\t\t\teach individual to be virtuous entails as a consequence the collective virtue of\n\t\t\t\t\tall. But there are admittedly three\n\t\t\t\t\tthings by which men are made good and virtuous, and these three things are\n\t\t\t\t\tnature, habit and reason. For to start with, one must be born with the nature of\n\t\t\t\t\ta human being and not of some other animal; and secondly, one must be born of a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain quality of body and of soul. But there are some qualities that it is of\n\t\t\t\t\tno use to be born with, for our habits make us alter them: some qualities\n\t\t\t\t\tin fact are made by nature liable to be modified by the habits in either\n\t\t\t\t\tdirection, for the worse or for the better. Now the other animals live chiefly by nature, though some\n\t\t\t\t\tin small degrees are guided by habits too; but man lives by reason also, for he\n\t\t\t\t\talone of animals possesses reason; so that in him these three things must be in\n\t\t\t\t\tharmony with one another; for men often act contrary to their acquired habits\n\t\t\t\t\tand to their nature because of their reason, if they are convinced that some\n\t\t\t\t\tother course of action is preferable.Now we have\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready defined the proper\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural character of those who are to be amenable to the hand of the legislator;\n\t\t\t\t\twhat now remains is the task of education, for men learn some things by\n\t\t\t\t\tpractice, others by precept.But since every political community is\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of rulers and subjects, we must therefore consider whether the rulers\n\t\t\t\t\tand the subjects ought to change, or to remain the same through life; for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear that their education also will have to be made to correspond with this\n\t\t\t\t\tdistribution of functions. If then it were the case that the one class differed\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the other as widely as we believe the gods and heroes to differ from\n\t\t\t\t\tmankind, having first a great superiority in regard to the body and then in\n\t\t\t\t\tregard tothe soul, so that the\n\t\t\t\t\tpre-eminence of the rulers was indisputable and manifest to the subjects, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear that it would be better for the same persons always to be rulers and\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects once for all; but as this\n\t\t\t\t\tis not easy to secure, and as we do not find anything corresponding to the great\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference that Scylax states to exist between kings and subjects in , it is clear that for many reasons it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary for all to share alike in ruling and being ruled in turn. For equality\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans for persons who are alike identity of status, and also it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult for a constitution to endure that is\n\t\t\t\t\tframed in contravention of justice. For all the people throughout the country\n\t\t\t\t\tare ranged on the side of the subject class in wishing for a revolution, and it\n\t\t\t\t\tis a thing inconceivable that those in the government should be sufficiently\n\t\t\t\t\tnumerous to over power all of these together. But yet on the other hand that the rulers ought to be\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperior to the subjects cannot be disputed; therefore the lawgiver must\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider how this is to be secured, and how they are to participate in the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment. And this has been already discussed. Nature has given the distinction by making the\n\t\t\t\t\tgroup that is itself the same in race partly younger and partly older, of which\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo sets it is appropriate to the one to be governed and for the other to\n\t\t\t\t\tgovern; and no one chafes or thinks himself better than his rulers when he is\n\t\t\t\t\tgoverned on the ground of age, especially as he is going to get back what he has\n\t\t\t\t\tthus contributed to the common stock when he reaches the proper age. In a sense therefore we must say that the\n\t\t\t\t\trulers and ruled are the same, and in a sense different. Hence their\n\t\t\t\t\teducation also is bound to be in one way the same and in another different. For\n\t\t\t\t\the who is to be a good ruler must have first been ruled, as the saying is and government,\n\t\t\t\t\tas has been said in the first discourses, is of two sorts, one carried on for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsake of the ruler and the other for the sake of the subject; of these the former\n\t\t\t\t\tis what we call the rule of a master,the latter is the government of free men .\n\t\t\t\t\t. .\n\t\t\t\t\tBut some of the commands given\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffer not in nature of the services commanded but in their object. Hence a\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of what are thought to be menial services can be honorably performed even\n\t\t\t\t\tby freemen in youth; since in regard to honor and dishonor actions do not differ\n\t\t\t\t\tso much in themselves as in their end and object. But since we say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the goodness of a citizen and ruler are the same as that of the best man,\n\t\t\t\t\tand that the same person ought to become a subject first and a ruler afterwards,\n\t\t\t\t\tit will be important for the legislator to study how and by what courses of\n\t\t\t\t\ttraining good men are to be produced, and what is the end of the best\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlife.The soul is divided into two parts, of which one is in itself\n\t\t\t\t\tpossessed of reason, while the other is not rational in itself but capable of\n\t\t\t\t\tobeying reason. To these parts in our view belong those virtues in accordance\n\t\t\t\t\twith which a man is pronounced to be good in some way. But in which of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthesetwo parts the end of man\n\t\t\t\t\trather resides, those who define the parts of the soul in accordance with our\n\t\t\t\t\tview will have no doubt as to how they should decide. The worse always exists as\n\t\t\t\t\ta means to the better, and this is manifest alike in the products of art and in\n\t\t\t\t\tthose of nature; but the rational part of the soul is better than the\n\t\t\t\t\tirrational. And the rational part\n\t\t\t\t\tis subdivided into two, according to our usual scheme of division; for reason is\n\t\t\t\t\tof two kinds, practical and theoretic, so that obviously the rational part of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe soul must also be subdivided accordingly. A corresponding classification we\n\t\t\t\t\tshall also pronounce to hold among its activities: the activities of the part of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe soul that is by nature superior must be preferable for those persons who are\n\t\t\t\t\tcapable of attaining either all the soul's activities or two out of the three; since\n\t\t\t\t\tthat thing is always most desirable for each person which is the highest to\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it is possible for him to attain. Also life as a whole is divided into business and leisure,\n\t\t\t\t\tand war and peace, and our actions are aimed some of them at things necessary\n\t\t\t\t\tand useful, others at things noble. In these matters the same principle of\n\t\t\t\t\tpreference that applies to the parts of the soul must apply also to the\n\t\t\t\t\tactivities of those parts: war must be for the sake of peace, business for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsake of leisure, things necessary and useful for the purpose of things noble.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe statesman therefore must\n\t\t\t\t\tlegislate with all these considerations in view, both in respect of the parts of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe soul and of their activities, and aiming more particularly at the greater\n\t\t\t\t\tgoods and the ends. And the same principle applies in regard to modes of life\n\t\t\t\t\tand choices of conduct: a man should be capable of engaging in business and war,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut still more capable of living in peace and leisure; and he\n\t\t\t\t\tshould do what is necessary and useful, but still more should he do what is\n\t\t\t\t\tnoble. These then are the aims that ought to be kept in view in the education of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe citizens both while still children and at the later ages that require\n\t\t\t\t\teducation. But the Greek peoples\n\t\t\t\t\treputed at the present day to have the best constitutions, and the lawgivers\n\t\t\t\t\tthat established them, manifestly did not frame their constitutional systems\n\t\t\t\t\twith reference to the best end, nor construct their laws and their scheme of\n\t\t\t\t\teducation with a view to all the virtues, but they swerved aside in a vulgar\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner towards those excellences that are supposed to be useful and more\n\t\t\t\t\tconducive to gain. And following the same lines as they, some later writers also\n\t\t\t\t\thave pronounced the same opinion: in praising the Spartan constitution they\n\t\t\t\t\texpress admiration for the aim of its founder on the ground that he framed the\n\t\t\t\t\twhole of his legislation with a view to conquest and to war. These views are easy to refute on\n\t\t\t\t\ttheoretical grounds and also have now been refuted by the facts of history. For\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as most of mankind covet being master of many servants because this produces a manifold supply of\n\t\t\t\t\tfortune's goods, so Thibron\n\t\t\t\t\tand all the other writers about the Spartan constitutionshow admiration for the lawgiver of the Spartans\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause owing to their having been trained to meet dangers they governed a wide\n\t\t\t\t\tempire. Yet it clearly follows\n\t\t\t\t\tthat since as a matter of fact at the present day the Spartans no longer possess\n\t\t\t\t\tan empire, they are not happy, and their lawgiver was not a good one. And it is\n\t\t\t\t\tridiculous that although they have kept to his laws, and although nothing\n\t\t\t\t\thinders their observing the laws, they have lost the noble life. Also writers\n\t\t\t\t\thave a wrong conception of the power for which the lawgiver should display\n\t\t\t\t\testeem; to govern freemen is nobler and more conjoined with virtue than to rule\n\t\t\t\t\tdespotically. And again it is not\n\t\t\t\t\ta proper ground for deeming a state happy and for praising its lawgiver, that it\n\t\t\t\t\thas practised conquest with a view to ruling over its neighbors. This principle is most\n\t\t\t\t\tdisastrous; it follows from it that an individual citizen who has the capacity\n\t\t\t\t\tought to endeavor to attain the power to hold sway over his own city; but this\n\t\t\t\t\tis just what the Spartans charge as a reproach against their king Pausanias,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough he attained such high honor. No principle therefore and no law of this\n\t\t\t\t\tnature is either statesmanlike or profitable, nor is it true; the same ideals\n\t\t\t\t\tare the best both for individuals and for communities, and the lawgiver should\n\t\t\t\t\tendeavor to implant them in the souls of mankind. The proper object of practising military training is not\n\t\t\t\t\tin order that men may enslave those who do not deserve slavery, but in order\n\t\t\t\t\tthat first they may themselves avoid becoming enslaved to others; then so that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey may seek suzerainty for the benefit of the subject people, but not\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the sake of world-wide despotism; and thirdly to hold despotic power over\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who deserve to be slaves. Experience supports the testimony of theory, that it is the duty of the\n\t\t\t\t\tlawgiver rather to study how he may frame his legislation both with regard to\n\t\t\t\t\twarfare and in other departments for the object of leisure and of peace. Most\n\t\t\t\t\tmilitary states remain safe while at war but perish when they have won their\n\t\t\t\t\tempire; in peace-time they lose their keen temper, like iron. The lawgiver is to blame, because\n\t\t\t\t\the did not educate them to be able to employ leisure.And since it appears that\n\t\t\t\t\tmen have the same end collectively and individually, and since the same\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinctive aim must necessarily belong both to the best man and to the best\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment, it is clear that the virtues relating to leisure are essential; since, as has been said repeatedly, peace is the end of\n\t\t\t\t\twar, leisure of business. But the\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtues useful for leisure and for its employment are not only those that\n\t\t\t\t\toperate during leisure but also those that operate in business; for many of the\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessaries must needs be forthcoming to give us opportunity for leisure.\n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore it is proper for the state to be temperate,brave and enduring; since, as the proverb goes,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is no leisure for slaves, but people unable to face danger bravely are the\n\t\t\t\t\tslaves of their assailants. Therefore courage and fortitude are needed for business, love of wisdom for\n\t\t\t\t\tleisure, temperance and justice for both seasons, and more especially when men\n\t\t\t\t\tare at peace and have leisure; for war compels men to be just and temperate,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas the enjoyment of prosperity and peaceful leisure tend to make them\n\t\t\t\t\tinsolent. Therefore much justice\n\t\t\t\t\tand much temperance are needed by those who are deemed very prosperous and who\n\t\t\t\t\tenjoy all the things counted as blessings, like the persons, if such there be,\n\t\t\t\t\tas the poets say, that dwell in the Islands of the Blest; these will most need wisdom,\n\t\t\t\t\ttemperance and justice, the more they are at leisure and have an abundance of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch blessings. It is clear therefore why a state that is to be happy and\n\t\t\t\t\trighteous must share in these virtues; for if it is disgraceful to be unable to\n\t\t\t\t\tuse our good things, it is still more disgraceful to be unable to use them in\n\t\t\t\t\ttime of leisure, and although showing ourselves good men when engaged in\n\t\t\t\t\tbusiness and war, in times of peace and leisure to seem no better than slaves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTherefore we must not\n\t\t\t\t\tcultivate virtue after the manner of the state of . The superiority of the Spartans\n\t\t\t\t\tover other races does not lie in their holding a different opinion from\n\t\t\t\t\tothers as to what things are the greatest goods, but rather in their believing\n\t\t\t\t\tthat these are obtained by means of one particular virtue; yet because they both\n\t\t\t\t\tdeem these things and their enjoyment to be greater goods than the enjoyment of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe virtues . . .\n\t\t\t\t\t. . . and that it is to be practised for its own\n\t\t\t\t\tsake is manifest from these considerations; but it must now be considered how and by what means this\n\t\t\t\t\twill come about. Now we have indeed previously decided that it requires nature\n\t\t\t\t\tand habit and reason, and among these, what particular quality of nature men\n\t\t\t\t\tought to possess has been defined previously; but it remains to consider whether\n\t\t\t\t\tmen ought to be educated first by means of the reason or by the habits. For\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween reason and habit the most perfect harmony ought to exist, as it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible both for the reason to have missed the highest principle and for men to\n\t\t\t\t\thave been as wrongly trained through the habits. This therefore at all events is clear in the first place,\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of men as of other creatures, that their engendering starts from a\n\t\t\t\t\tbeginning, and that the end starts from a certain beginning that is another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend, and that reason and intelligence are for\n\t\t\t\t\tus the end of our natural development, so that it is with a view to these ends\n\t\t\t\t\tthat our engendering and the training of our habits must be regulated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd secondly, as soul and body\n\t\t\t\t\tare two, so we observe that the soul also has two parts, the irrational part and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe part possessing reason, and that the states which they experience are two in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber,the one being desire and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other intelligence; and as the body is prior in its development to the soul,\n\t\t\t\t\tso the irrational part of the soul is prior to the rational. And this also is\n\t\t\t\t\tobvious, because passion and will, and also appetite, exist in children even as soon as\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are born, but it is the nature of reasoning and intelligence to arise in\n\t\t\t\t\tthem as they grow older. Therefore in the first place it is necessary for the\n\t\t\t\t\ttraining of the body to precede that of the mind, and secondly for the training\n\t\t\t\t\tof the appetite to precede that of the intelligence; but the training of the\n\t\t\t\t\tappetite must be for the sake of the intellect, and that of the body for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsake of the soul.Inasmuch therefore as it is the duty of the lawgiver to\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider from the start how the children reared are to obtain the best bodily\n\t\t\t\t\tframes, he must first pay attention to the union of the sexes, and settle when\n\t\t\t\t\tand in what condition a couple should practise matrimonial intercourse. In\n\t\t\t\t\tlegislating for this partnership he must pay regard partly to the persons\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves and to their span of life, so that they may arrive together at the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame period in their ages, and their powers may not be at discord through the\n\t\t\t\t\tman being still capable of parentage and the wife incapable, or the wife capable\n\t\t\t\t\tand the man not for this causes differences and actual discord between\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, and also he must\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider as well the succession of the children, for the children must neither\n\t\t\t\t\tbe too far removed in their ages from the fathers since elderly\n\t\t\t\t\tfathers get no good from their children's return of their favors, nor do the\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren from the help they get from the fathers, nor must they be\n\t\t\t\t\ttoo near them for this involves much unpleasantness, since in such\n\t\t\t\t\tfamilies there is less respect felt between them, as between companions of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame age, and also the nearness of age leads to friction in household\n\t\t\t\t\taffairs; and in addition, to return to the point from which we began\n\t\t\t\t\tthis digression, measures must be taken to ensure that the children produced may\n\t\t\t\t\thave bodily frames suited to the wish of the lawgiver. These results then are almost all attained by one\n\t\t\t\t\tmode of regulation. For since the period of parentage terminates, speaking\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally, with men at the age of seventy at the outside, and with women at\n\t\t\t\t\tfifty, the commencement of their union should correspond in respect of age with\n\t\t\t\t\tthese times. But the mating of the\n\t\t\t\t\tyoung is bad for child-bearing; for in all animal species the offspring of the\n\t\t\t\t\tyoung are more imperfect and likely to produce female children, and small in figure, so that the same thing\n\t\t\t\t\tmust necessarily occur in the human race also. And a proof of this is that in\n\t\t\t\t\tall the states where it is the local custom to mate young men and young women,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people are deformed and small of body. And again young women labor more, and\n\t\t\t\t\tmore of them die in childbirth; indeed according to some accounts such was the\n\t\t\t\t\treason why the oracle was givento the people of , because many were dying owing to its being their\n\t\t\t\t\tcustom for the women to marry young, and it did not refer to the harvest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd again it also contributes\n\t\t\t\t\tto chastity for the bestowal of women in marriage to be made when they are\n\t\t\t\t\tolder, for it is thought that they are more licentious when they have had\n\t\t\t\t\tintercourse in youth. Also the males are thought to be arrested in bodily growth\n\t\t\t\t\tif they have intercourse while the seed is still growing, for this also has a\n\t\t\t\t\tfixed period after passing which it is no longer plentiful. Therefore it is fitting for the women to be married\n\t\t\t\t\tat about the age of eighteen and the men at thirty-seven or a little beforefor that will give long enough for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe union to take place with their bodily vigor at its prime, and for it to\n\t\t\t\t\tarrive with a convenient coincidence of dates at the time when procreation\n\t\t\t\t\tceases. Moreover the succession of the children to the estates, if their birth\n\t\t\t\t\tduly occurs soon after the parents marry, will take place when they are\n\t\t\t\t\tbeginning their prime, and when the parents' period of vigor has now come to a\n\t\t\t\t\tclose, towards the age of seventy. The proper age therefore for union has been discussed; as to the proper times\n\t\t\t\t\tin respect of the season we may accept what is customary with most people, who\n\t\t\t\t\thave rightly decided even as it is to practise marital cohabitation in winter.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd people should also study for themselves, when their time comes, the\n\t\t\t\t\tteachings of physicians and natural philosophers on the subject of the\n\t\t\t\t\tprocreation of children; the suitable bodily seasons are adequately discussed by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe physicians, and the question of weather by the natural\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophers, who say that north winds are more favorable than south. The particular kind of bodily constitution\n\t\t\t\t\tin the parents that will be most beneficial for the offspring must be dwelt on\n\t\t\t\t\tmore in detail in our discussion of the management of children; it is sufficient to speak of it in outline now. The athlete's\n\t\t\t\t\thabit of body is not serviceable for bodily fitness as required by a citizen,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor for health and parentage, nor yet is a habit that is too valetudinarian and\n\t\t\t\t\tunfit for labor, but the condition that lies between them. The bodily habit\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore should have been trained by exercise, but not by exercises that are\n\t\t\t\t\tviolent, and not for one form of labor only, as is the athlete's habit of body,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut for the pursuits of free men. And these arrangements must be provided alike\n\t\t\t\t\tfor men and women. And pregnant\n\t\t\t\t\twomen also must take care of their bodies, not avoiding exercise nor adopting a\n\t\t\t\t\tlow diet; this it is easy for the lawgiver to secure by ordering them to make a\n\t\t\t\t\tjourney daily for the due worship of the deities whose office is the control of\n\t\t\t\t\tchildbirth. As regards the mind, however, on the contrary it suits them to pass\n\t\t\t\t\tthe time more indolently than as regards their bodies; for children before birth\n\t\t\t\t\tare evidently affected by the mother just as growing plants are by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tearth.As to exposing\n\t\t\t\t\t\torrearing the children born, let\n\t\t\t\t\tthere be a law that no deformed child shall be reared; but on the ground of\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of children, if the regular customs hinder any of those born being\n\t\t\t\t\texposed, there must be a limit fixed to the procreation of offspring, and if any\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople have a child as a result of intercourse in contravention of these\n\t\t\t\t\tregulations, abortion must be practised on it before it has developed sensation\n\t\t\t\t\tand life; for the line between lawful and unlawful abortion will be marked by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe fact of having sensation and being alive. And since the beginning of the fit age for a man and for a\n\t\t\t\t\twoman, at which they are to begin their union, has been defined, let it also be\n\t\t\t\t\tdecided for how long a time it is suitable for them to serve the state in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter of producing children. For the offspring of too elderly parents, as those\n\t\t\t\t\tof too young ones, are born imperfect both in body and mind, and the children of\n\t\t\t\t\tthose that have arrived at old age are weaklings. Therefore the period must be\n\t\t\t\t\tlimited to correspond with the mental prime; and this in the case of most men is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe age stated by some of the poets, who measure men's age by periods of seven\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears,it is about the age of fifty. Therefore persons exceeding this age by four or five years\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be discharged from the duty of producing children for the community, and\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the rest of their lives if they have intercourse it must be manifestly for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of health or for some other similar reason. As to intercourse with\n\t\t\t\t\tanother woman or man, in general it must be dishonorable for them to be known to\n\t\t\t\t\ttake any part in it in any circumstances whatsoever as long as they are husband\n\t\t\t\t\tand wife and bear those names, but any who may be discovered doing anything of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sort during their period of parentage must be punished with a loss of\n\t\t\t\t\tprivilege suited to the offence.When the children have been born, the\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular mode of rearing adopted must be deemed an important determining\n\t\t\t\t\tinfluence in regard to their power of body. It appears from examining the other\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals, and is also shown by the foreign races that make it their aim to keep\n\t\t\t\t\tup the military habit of body, that a diet giving an abundance of milk is most\n\t\t\t\t\tsuited to the bodies of children, and one that allows rather little wine because\n\t\t\t\t\tof the diseases that it causes. Moreover it is advantageous to subject them to as many movements as are\n\t\t\t\t\tpracticable with children of that age. To prevent the limbs from being distorted\n\t\t\t\t\towing to softness, some races even now employ certain mechanical appliances that\n\t\t\t\t\tkeep the bodies of infants from being twisted. And it is also advantageous to\n\t\t\t\t\taccustom them at once from early childhood to cold, for this is most useful both\n\t\t\t\t\tfor health and with a view to military service. Hence among many non-Greek races\n\t\t\t\t\tit is customary in the case of some peoples to wash the children at birth by\n\t\t\t\t\tdipping them in a cold river, and with others, for instance the Celts, to give\n\t\t\t\t\tthem scanty covering. For it is\n\t\t\t\t\tbetter to inure them at the very start to everything possible, but to inure them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgradually;and the bodily habit of\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren is naturally well fitted by warmth to be trained to bear cold. In the\n\t\t\t\t\tearliest period of life then it is expedient to employ this or a similar method\n\t\t\t\t\tof nursing; and the next period to\n\t\t\t\t\tthis, up to the age of five, which it is not well to direct as yet to any study\n\t\t\t\t\tnor to compulsory labors, in order that they may not hinder the growth, should\n\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless be allowed enough movement to avoid bodily inactivity; and this\n\t\t\t\t\texercise should be obtained by means of various pursuits, particularly play. But\n\t\t\t\t\teven the games must not be unfit for freemen, nor laborious, nor undisciplined.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlso the question of the kind\n\t\t\t\t\tof tales and stories that should be told to children of this age must be\n\t\t\t\t\tattended to by the officials called Children's Tutors. For all such amusements\n\t\t\t\t\tshould prepare the way for their later pursuits; hence most children's games\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be imitations of the serious occupations of later life. The legislators in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe forbid allowing\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren to have paroxysms of crying, but this prohibition is a mistake; violent\n\t\t\t\t\tcrying contributes to growth, for it serves in a way as exercise for the body,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince holding the breath is the strength giving factor in hard labor, and this\n\t\t\t\t\ttakes place also with children when they stretch themselves in crying. The\n\t\t\t\t\tTutors must supervise the children's pastimes, and in particular must see that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey associate as little as possible with slaves. For children of this age,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand up to seven years old, must necessarily be reared at home;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso it is reasonable to suppose\n\t\t\t\t\tthat even at this age they may acquire a taint of illiberality from what they\n\t\t\t\t\thear and see. The lawgiver ought therefore to banish indecent talk, as much as\n\t\t\t\t\tanything else, out of the state altogether for light talk about\n\t\t\t\t\tanything disgraceful soon passes into actionso most of all\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom among the young, so that they may not say nor hear anything of the sort;\n\t\t\t\t\tand anybody found saying or doing any of the things prohibited, if he is of free\n\t\t\t\t\tstation but not yet promoted to reclining at the public meals, must be punished\n\t\t\t\t\twith marks of dishonor and with beating, and an older offender must be punished\n\t\t\t\t\twith marks of dishonor degrading to a free man, because of his slavish behavior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd since we banish any talk of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis kind, clearly we must also banish the seeing of either pictures or\n\t\t\t\t\trepresentations that are indecent. The officials must therefore be careful that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere may be no sculpture or painting that represents indecent actions, except\n\t\t\t\t\tin the temples of a certain class of gods to whom the law allows even\n\t\t\t\t\tscurrility; but in regard to these the law permits\n\t\t\t\t\tmen still of suitable age to worship the gods both on their own behalf and on\n\t\t\t\t\tbehalf of the children and women.But the younger ones must not\n\t\t\t\t\tbe allowed in the audience at lampoons\n\t\t\t\t\tand at comedy, before they reach the age at which they will now have the right\n\t\t\t\t\tto recline at table in company and to drink deeply, and at which their education\n\t\t\t\t\twill render all of them immune to the harmful effects of such things. For the\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent therefore we have merely mentioned these matters in passing, but later\n\t\t\t\t\twe must stop to settle them more definitely, first discussing fully whether\n\t\t\t\t\tlegislation prohibiting the attendance of the young is desirable or not, and how\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch prohibition should be put in force; but on the present occasion we have\n\t\t\t\t\ttouched on the question only in the manner necessary. For perhaps the tragic actor Theodorus used to put the matter not badly: he had\n\t\t\t\t\tnever once allowed anybody to produce his part before him, not even one of the poor actors, as he\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid that audiences are attracted by what they hear first; and this happens\n\t\t\t\t\talike in regard to our dealings with people and to our dealings with\n\t\t\t\t\tthingsall that comes first we like better. On this account we ought\n\t\t\t\t\tto make all base things unfamiliar to the young, and especially those that\n\t\t\t\t\tinvolve either depravity or malignity.But when\n\t\t\t\t\tthe five years from two to seven have passed, the children must now become\n\t\t\t\t\tspectators at the lessons which they will themselves have to learn. And there are two ages corresponding to\n\t\t\t\t\twhich education should be dividedthere must be a break after the\n\t\t\t\t\tperiod from seven to puberty, and again after that from puberty to twenty-one.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor those who divide the ages by periods of seven years are generally speaking\n\t\t\t\t\tnot wrong,\n\t\t\t\t\tand it is proper to follow the division of nature, for all art and education\n\t\t\t\t\taim at filling up nature's deficiencies. First therefore we must consider\n\t\t\t\t\twhether some regulation in regard to the boys ought to be instituted, next\n\t\t\t\t\twhether it is advantageous for their supervision to be conducted on a public\n\t\t\t\t\tfooting or in a private manner as is done at present in most states, and thirdly\n\t\t\t\t\tof what particular nature this supervision ought to be."}}, {"@n": "8", "@type": "Book",

Indeed the neglect of this in states is injurious to\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir constitutions; for education ought to be adapted to the particular form of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitution, since the particular character belonging to each constitution both\n\t\t\t\t\tguards the constitution generally and originally establishes itfor\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance the democratic spirit promotes democracy and the oligarchic spirit\n\t\t\t\t\toligarchy; and the best spirit always causes a better constitution. Moreover in regard to all the faculties and\n\t\t\t\t\tcrafts certain forms of preliminary educationand training in their various operations are necessarys o that\n\t\t\t\t\tmanifestly this is also requisite in regard to the actions of virtue. And\n\t\t\t\t\tinasmuch as the end for the whole state is one, it is manifest that education\n\t\t\t\t\talso must necessarily be one and the same for all and that the superintendence\n\t\t\t\t\tof this must be public, and not on private lines, in the way in which at present\n\t\t\t\t\teach man superintends the education of his own children, teaching them\n\t\t\t\t\tprivately, and whatever special branch of knowledge he thinks fit. But matters\n\t\t\t\t\tof public interest ought to be under public supervision; at the same time we\n\t\t\t\t\tought not to think that any of the citizens belongs to himself, but that all\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to the state, for each is a part of the state, and it is natural for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperintendence of the several parts to have regard to the superintendence of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe whole. And one might praise the\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartans in respect of this, for they pay the greatest attention to the training\n\t\t\t\t\tof their children, and conduct it on a public system.It is clear then that there should be legislation about\n\t\t\t\t\teducation and that it should be conducted on a public system. But consideration\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be given to the question, what constitutes education and what is the proper\n\t\t\t\t\tway to be educated. At present there are differences of opinion as to the proper\n\t\t\t\t\ttasks to be set; for all peoples do not agree as to the things that the young\n\t\t\t\t\tought to learn, either with a view to virtue or with a view to the best life,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor is it clear whether their studies should be regulated more with regard to\n\t\t\t\t\tintellect or with regard to character. And confusing questions arise out of the education that\n\t\t\t\t\tactually prevails, and it is not at all clear whether the pupils should practise\n\t\t\t\t\tpursuits that are practically morally edifying, or higher\n\t\t\t\t\taccomplishmentsfor all these views have won the support of some\n\t\t\t\t\tjudges; and nothing is agreed as regards the exercise conducive to\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue, for, to start with, all men do not honor the same virtue, so that they\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally hold different opinions in regard to training in virtue.It is\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore not difficult to see that the young must be taught those useful arts\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are indispensably necessary; but it is clear that they should not be taught\n\t\t\t\t\tall the useful arts, those pursuits that are liberal being kept distinct from\n\t\t\t\t\tthose that are illiberal, and that they must participate in such among the\n\t\t\t\t\tuseful arts as will not render the person who participates in them vulgar. A\n\t\t\t\t\ttask and also an art or a science must be deemed vulgar if it renders the body\n\t\t\t\t\tor soul or mind of free men useless for the employments and actions of virtue.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence we entitle vulgar all such arts as deteriorate the condition of the body,\n\t\t\t\t\tand also the industries that earn wages; for they make the mind preoccupied and\n\t\t\t\t\tdegraded. And even with the liberal\n\t\t\t\t\tsciences, although it is not illiberal to take part in some of them up to a\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint, to devote oneself to them too assiduously and carefully is liable to have\n\t\t\t\t\tthe injurious results specified. Also it makes much difference what object one\n\t\t\t\t\thas in view in a pursuit or study; if one follows it for the sake of oneself or\n\t\t\t\t\tone's friends, or on moral grounds, it is not illiberal,but the man who follows the same pursuit because of\n\t\t\t\t\tother people would often appear to be acting in a menial and servile\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanner.The branches of study at present\n\t\t\t\t\testablished fall into both classes, as was said before.\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are perhaps four customary\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects of education, reading and writing, gymnastics, music, and fourth, with\n\t\t\t\t\tsome people, drawing; reading and writing and drawing being taught as being\n\t\t\t\t\tuseful for the purposes of life and very serviceable, and gymnastics as\n\t\t\t\t\tcontributing to manly courage; but as to music, here one might raise a question.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor at present most people take part in it for the sake of pleasure; but those,\n\t\t\t\t\twho originally included it in education did so because, as has often been said,\n\t\t\t\t\tnature itself seeks to be able not only to engage rightly in business but also\n\t\t\t\t\tto occupy leisure nobly; forto speak about it yet againthis\n\t\t\t\t\tis the first principle of all things. For if although both business and leisure are necessary, yet leisure is more\n\t\t\t\t\tdesirable and more fully an end than business, we must inquire what is the\n\t\t\t\t\tproper occupation of leisure. For assuredly it should not be employed in play,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince it would follow that play is our end in life. But if this is impossible,\n\t\t\t\t\tand sports should rather be employed in our times of business for a\n\t\t\t\t\tman who is at work needs rest, and rest is the object of play, while business is\n\t\t\t\t\taccompanied by toil and exertion, it follows that in introducing\n\t\t\t\t\tsports we must watch the right opportunity for their employment, since we are\n\t\t\t\t\tapplying them to serve as medicine; for the activity of play is a relaxation of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe soul, and serves as recreation because of its pleasantness. But leisure seems itself to\n\t\t\t\t\tcontain pleasure and happiness and felicity of life. And this is not possessed\n\t\t\t\t\tby the busy but by the leisured; for the busy man busies himself for the sake of\n\t\t\t\t\tsome end as not being in his possession, but happiness is an end achieved, which\n\t\t\t\t\tall men think is accompanied by pleasure and not by pain. But all men do not go\n\t\t\t\t\ton to define this pleasure in the same way, but according to their various\n\t\t\t\t\tnatures and to their own characters, and the pleasure with which the best man\n\t\t\t\t\tthinks that happiness is conjoined is the best pleasure and the one arising from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe noblest sources. So that it is clear that some subjects must be learnt and\n\t\t\t\t\tacquired merely with a view to the pleasure in their pursuit, and that these\n\t\t\t\t\tstudies and these branches of learning are ends in themselves, while the forms\n\t\t\t\t\tof learning related to business are studied as necessary and as means to other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings. Hence our predecessors\n\t\t\t\t\tincluded music in education not as a necessity for there is nothing\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary about it, nor as useful in the way in which\n\t\t\t\t\treading and writing are useful for business and for household management and for\n\t\t\t\t\tacquiring learning and for many pursuits of civil life, while drawing also seems\n\t\t\t\t\tto be useful in making us better judges of the works of artists, nor\n\t\t\t\t\tyet again as we pursue gymnastics,for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of health and strength for we do not see either of these\n\t\t\t\t\tthings produced as a result of music; it remains therefore that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tuseful as a pastime in leisure, which is evidently the purpose for which people\n\t\t\t\t\tactually introduce it, for they rank it as a form of pastime that they think\n\t\t\t\t\tproper for free men. For this reason Homer wrote thus:  and after these words he speaks of certain others  And also in other verses Odysseus says that this is the best pastime,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen, as men are enjoying good cheer, \n\t\t\t\t\tIt is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear therefore that there is a form of education in which boys should be\n\t\t\t\t\ttrained not because it is useful or necessary but as being liberal and noble;\n\t\t\t\t\tthough whether there is one such subject of education or several, and what these\n\t\t\t\t\tare and how they are to be pursued, must be discussed later, but as it is we have\n\t\t\t\t\tmade this much progress on the way, that we have some testimony even from the\n\t\t\t\t\tancients, derived from the courses of education which they foundedfor\n\t\t\t\t\tthe point is proved by music. And it is also clear that some of the useful\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects as well ought to be studied by the young not only because of their\n\t\t\t\t\tutility, like the study of reading and writing, but also because they may lead\n\t\t\t\t\ton to many other branches of knowledge; and similarly they should study drawing not in order that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey may not go wrong in their private purchases and may avoid being cheated in\n\t\t\t\t\tbuying and selling furniture, but rather because this study makes a man\n\t\t\t\t\tobservant of bodily beauty; and to seek for utility everywhere is entirely\n\t\t\t\t\tunsuited to men that are great-souled and free. And since it is plain that\n\t\t\t\t\teducation by habit must come before education by reason, and training of the\n\t\t\t\t\tbody before training of the mind, it is clear from these considerations that the\n\t\t\t\t\tboys must be handed over to the care of the wrestling-master and the trainer;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the latter imparts a certain quality to the habit of the body and the former\n\t\t\t\t\tto its actions.Now at the present time some of the states reputed to pay the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatest attention to children produce in them an athletic habit to the detriment of their bodily form and growth, while the\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartans although they have avoided this error yet make their boys animal in\n\t\t\t\t\tnature by their laborious exercises, in the belief that this is most\n\t\t\t\t\tcontributory to manly courage. Yet, as has often been said, it is not right to\n\t\t\t\t\tregulate education with a view to one virtue only, or to this one most of all;\n\t\t\t\t\tindeed they do not even investigate the question whether this virtue is to be\n\t\t\t\t\thad in view at all. For neither in the lower animals nor in the case of foreign\n\t\t\t\t\traces do we see that courage goes with the wildest, but rather with the gentler\n\t\t\t\t\tand lion-like temperaments.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd there are manyforeign races inclined to murder and cannibalism,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example among the tribes of the  the Achaeans and Heniochi, and others of the mainland races,\n\t\t\t\t\tsome in the same degree as those named and some more, which although piratical\n\t\t\t\t\thave got no share of manly courage. And again we know that even the Spartans,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough so long as they persisted by themselves in their laborious exercises\n\t\t\t\t\tthey surpassed all other peoples, now fall behind others both in gymnastic and\n\t\t\t\t\tin military contests; for they used not to excel because they exercised their\n\t\t\t\t\tyoung men in this fashion but only because they trained and their adversaries\n\t\t\t\t\tdid not. Consequently honor and not\n\t\t\t\t\tanimal ferocity should play the first part; for it is not a wolf nor one of the\n\t\t\t\t\tother wild animals that will venture upon any noble hazard, but rather a good\n\t\t\t\t\tman. But those who let boys pursue these hard exercises too much and turn them\n\t\t\t\t\tout untrained in necessary things in real truth render them vulgar, making them\n\t\t\t\t\tavailable for statesmanship to use for one task only, and even for this task\n\t\t\t\t\ttraining them worse than others do, as our argument proves. And we must not judge them from their former achievements but from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe facts of today; for they have rivals in their education now, but they used\n\t\t\t\t\tto have none before.It is therefore agreed that we should employ gymnastic\n\t\t\t\t\ttraining, and how we should employ it. For until puberty we should apply lighter\n\t\t\t\t\texercises, forbidding hard diet and severe exertions, in order that nothing may\n\t\t\t\t\thinder the growth; for there is no small proof that too severe\n\t\t\t\t\ttraining can produce this result in the fact that in the list of Olympic victors\n\t\t\t\t\tone would only find two or three persons who have won both as men and as boys,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause when people go into training in youth the severe exercises rob them of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir strength. But when they have\n\t\t\t\t\tspent three years after puberty upon their other studies, then it is suitable to\n\t\t\t\t\toccupy the next period of life with laborious exercises and strict training\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiet; for\n\t\t\t\t\tit is wrong to work hard with the mind and the body at the same time; for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe nature of the two different sorts of exertion to produce opposite effects,\n\t\t\t\t\tbodily toil impeding the development of the mind and mental toil that of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody.About music on the other hand we have previously raised some\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions in the course of our argument, but it is well to take them up again\n\t\t\t\t\tand carry them further now, in order that this may give the key so to speak for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe principles which one might advance in pronouncing about it. For it is not\n\t\t\t\t\teasy to say precisely what potency it possesses, nor yet for the sake of what\n\t\t\t\t\tobject one should participate in itwhether for amusement and\n\t\t\t\t\trelaxation, as one indulges in sleep and deep drinking for these in\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves are not serious pursuits but merely pleasant, and relax\n\t\t\t\t\tour care, as Euripides says; owing to\n\t\t\t\t\twhich people actually class music with them andemploy all of these things, sleep, deep drinking and music, in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same way, and they also place dancing in the same class;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor whether we ought rather to\n\t\t\t\t\tthink that music tends in some degree to virtue music being capable of\n\t\t\t\t\tproducing a certain quality of character just as gymnastics are capable of\n\t\t\t\t\tproducing a certain quality of body, music accustoming men to be able to rejoice\n\t\t\t\t\trightly; or that it contributes something to intellectual\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentertainment and culture for this must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe set down as a third alternative among those mentioned. Now it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot difficult to see that one must not make amusement the object of the\n\t\t\t\t\teducation of the young; for amusement does not go with\n\t\t\t\t\tlearninglearning is a painful process. Nor yet moreover is it\n\t\t\t\t\tsuitable to assign intellectual entertainment to boys and to the young; for a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing that is an end does not belong to anything that is imperfect. But perhaps it might be thought that the\n\t\t\t\t\tserious pursuits of boys are for the sake of amusement when they have grown up\n\t\t\t\t\tto be men. But, if something of this sort is the case, why should the young need\n\t\t\t\t\tto learn this accomplishment themselves, and not, like the Persian and Median\n\t\t\t\t\tkings, participate in the pleasure and the education of music by means of others\n\t\t\t\t\tperforming it? for those who have made music a business and profession must\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily perform better than those who practise only long enough to learn.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut if it is proper for them to labor at accomplishments of this sort, then it\n\t\t\t\t\twould also be right for them to prepare the dishes of an elaborate cuisine; but\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is absurd. And the same\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty also arises as to the question whether learning music can improve\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir characters; for why should they learn to perform edifying music\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, instead of learning to enjoy it rightly and be able to judge it\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they hear others performing, as the Spartans do? for the Spartans although\n\t\t\t\t\tthey do not learn to perform can nevertheless judge good and bad music\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrectly, so it is said. And the same argument applies also if music is to be\n\t\t\t\t\temployed for refined enjoyment and entertainment; why need people learn to\n\t\t\t\t\tperform themselves instead of enjoying music played by others? And we may consider the conception that we\n\t\t\t\t\thave about the gods: Zeus does not sing and harp to the poets himself. But\n\t\t\t\t\tprofessional musicians we speak of as vulgar people, and indeed we think it not\n\t\t\t\t\tmanly to perform music, except when drunk or for fun.But perhaps these points\n\t\t\t\t\twill have to be considered afterwards; our first inquiry is whether music ought\n\t\t\t\t\tnot or ought to be included in education, and what is its efficacy among the\n\t\t\t\t\tthree uses of it that have been discusseddoes it serve for education\n\t\t\t\t\tor amusement or entertainment? It is reasonable to reckon it under all of these\n\t\t\t\t\theads, and it appears to participate in them all. Amusement is for the sake of\n\t\t\t\t\trelaxation, and relaxation must necessarily be pleasant, for it is a way of\n\t\t\t\t\tcuring the pain due to laborious work; also entertainment ought admittedly to be\n\t\t\t\t\tnot only honorable but also pleasant, for happiness is derived from both honor\n\t\t\t\t\tand pleasure;but we all pronounce\n\t\t\t\t\tmusic to be one of the pleasantest things, whether instrumental or instrumental\n\t\t\t\t\tand vocal music together at least Musaeus says, Song is man's sweetest joy,\n\t\t\t\t\tand that is why people with good reason introduce it at parties and\n\t\t\t\t\tentertainments, for its exhilarating effect, so that for this reason\n\t\t\t\t\talso one might suppose that the younger men ought to be educated in music. For\n\t\t\t\t\tall harmless pleasures are not only suitable for the ultimate object but also\n\t\t\t\t\tfor relaxation; and as it but rarely happens for men to reach their ultimate\n\t\t\t\t\tobject, whereas they often relax and pursue amusement not so much with some\n\t\t\t\t\tulterior object but because of the pleasure of it, it would be serviceable to\n\t\t\t\t\tlet them relax at intervals in the pleasures derived from music. But it has come about that men make\n\t\t\t\t\tamusements an end; for the end also perhaps contains a certain pleasure, but not\n\t\t\t\t\tany ordinary pleasure, and seeking this they take the other as being this\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause it has a certain resemblance to the achievement of the end of their\n\t\t\t\t\tundertakings. For the end is desirable not for the sake of anything that will\n\t\t\t\t\tresult from it, and also pleasures of the sort under consideration are not\n\t\t\t\t\tdesirable for the sake of some future result, but because of things that have\n\t\t\t\t\thappened already, for instance labor and pain. One might then perhaps assume\n\t\t\t\t\tthis to be the reason which causes men to seek to procure happiness by means of\n\t\t\t\t\tthose pleasures; but in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\ttaking part in music, this is not because of this reason only, but also because\n\t\t\t\t\tperforming music is useful, as it seems, for relaxation. But nevertheless we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust examine whether it is not the case that, although this has come about,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyet the nature of music is more honorable than corresponds with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe employment of it mentioned, and it is proper not only to participate in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon pleasure that springs from it, which is perceptible to everybody\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the pleasure contained in music is of a natural kind, owing to\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the use of it is dear to those of all ages and characters, but\n\t\t\t\t\tto see if its influence reaches also in a manner to the character and to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsoul. And this would clearly be the case if we are affected in our characters in\n\t\t\t\t\ta certain manner by it. But it is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear that we are affected in a certain manner, both by many other kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\tmusic and not least by the melodies of ; for these admittedly make our souls\n\t\t\t\t\tenthusiastic, and enthusiasm is an affection of the character of the soul. And\n\t\t\t\t\tmoreover everybody when listening to imitations is thrown into a corresponding state of feeling, even apart\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the rhythms and tunes themselves. And since it is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase that music is one of the things that give pleasure, and that virtue has to\n\t\t\t\t\tdo with feeling delight and love and hatred rightly, there is obviously nothing\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is more needful to learn and become habituated to than to judge\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrectly and to delight in virtuous characters and noble actions; but rhythms and melodies contain\n\t\t\t\t\trepresentations of angerand mildness,\n\t\t\t\t\tand also of courage and temperance and all their opposites and the other moral\n\t\t\t\t\tqualities, that most closely correspond to the true natures of these qualities\n\t\t\t\t\tand this is clear from the facts of what occurswhen we\n\t\t\t\t\tlisten to such representations we change in our soul; and habituation\n\t\t\t\t\tin feeling pain and delight at representations of reality is close to feeling\n\t\t\t\t\tthem towards actual reality for example, if a man delights in\n\t\t\t\t\tbeholding the statue of somebody for no other reason than because of its actual\n\t\t\t\t\tform, the actual sight of the person whose statue he beholds must also of\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity give him pleasure; and it is the case that whereas the other objects of\n\t\t\t\t\tsensation contain no representation of character, for example the objects of\n\t\t\t\t\ttouch and taste though the objects of sight do so slightly, for there\n\t\t\t\t\tare forms that represent character, but only to a small extent, and not all men participate in visual perception of such\n\t\t\t\t\tqualities; also visual works of art are not representations of character but\n\t\t\t\t\trather the forms and colors produced are mere indications of character, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthese indications are only bodily sensations during the emotions; not but what\n\t\t\t\t\tin so far as there is a difference even in regard to the observation of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindications, the young must\n\t\t\t\t\tnot look at the works of Pauson but those of Polygnotus, and of any other moral painter or\n\t\t\t\t\tsculptor, pieces of music\n\t\t\t\t\ton the contrary do actually contain in them selves imitations of character; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is manifest, for even in the nature of the mere melodies there are\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferences, so that people when hearing them are affected differently and have\n\t\t\t\t\tnot the same feelings in regard to each of them, but listen to some in a more\n\t\t\t\t\tmournful and restrained state, for instance the mode called Mixolydian, and\n\t\t\t\t\tto others in a softer state of mind, but in a midway state and with the greatest\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposure to another, as the Dorian mode alone of tunes seems to act, while the\n\t\t\t\t\tPhrygian makes men enthusiastic; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthese things are well stated by those who have studied this form of education,\n\t\t\t\t\tas they derive the evidence for their theories from the actual facts of\n\t\t\t\t\texperience. And the same holds good about the rhythms also, for some have a more\n\t\t\t\t\tstable and others a more emotional character, and of the latter some are more\n\t\t\t\t\tvulgar in their emotional effects and others more liberal. From these\n\t\t\t\t\tconsiderations therefore it is plain that music has the power of producing a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain effect on the moral character of the soul, and if it has the power to do\n\t\t\t\t\tthis, it is clear that the young must be directed to music and must be educated\n\t\t\t\t\tin it. Also education in music is\n\t\t\t\t\twell adapted to the youthful nature; for the young owing to their youth cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tendure any thing not sweetened by pleasure, and music is by nature a thing that\n\t\t\t\t\thas a pleasant sweetness. And we seem to have a certain affinity with tunes and\n\t\t\t\t\trhythms; owing to which many wise men say either that the soul is a harmony or\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it has harmony.We ought now\n\t\t\t\t\tto decide the question raised earlier, whether the young ought to learn music by\n\t\t\t\t\tsinging and playing themselves or not. It is not difficult to see that it makes\n\t\t\t\t\ta great difference in the process of acquiring a certain quality whether one\n\t\t\t\t\ttakes a part in the actions that impart it oneself; for it is a thing that is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible, or difficult, to become a good judge of performances if one has not\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken part in them. At the same time also boys must have some occupation, and\n\t\t\t\t\tone must think Archytas's rattle a good invention, which people give to\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren in order that while occupied with this they may not break any of the\n\t\t\t\t\tfurniture; for young things cannot keep still. Whereas then a rattle is a\n\t\t\t\t\tsuitable occupation for infant children, education serves as a rattle for young\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople when older. Such considerations therefore prove that children should be\n\t\t\t\t\ttrained in music so as actually to take part in its performance; and it is not difficult to distinguish what\n\t\t\t\t\tis suitable and unsuitable for various ages, and to refute those who assert that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe practice of music is vulgar. For first, inasmuch as it is necessary to take\n\t\t\t\t\tpart in the performances for the sake of judging them, it is therefore proper\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the pupils when young actually to engage in the performances, though when\n\t\t\t\t\tthey get older they should be released from performing, but be able to judge\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is beautiful and enjoy it rightly because of the study in which they\n\t\t\t\t\tengaged in their youth. Then as to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe objection raised by some people that music makes people vulgar, it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to solve it by considering how far pupils who are being educated with\n\t\t\t\t\ta view to civic virtue should take part in the actual performance of music,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand in what times and what rhythms they should take part, and\n\t\t\t\t\talso what kinds of instruments should be used in their studies, as this\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally makes a difference. For the solution of the objection depends upon\n\t\t\t\t\tthese points, as it is quite possible that some modes of music do produce the\n\t\t\t\t\tresult mentioned. It is manifest\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore that the study of music must not place a hindrance in the way of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubsequent activities, nor vulgarize the bodily frame and make it useless for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe exercises of the soldier and the citizen, either for their practical pursuit\n\t\t\t\t\tnow or for their scientific study later on. And this would come about in respect of their study if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe pupils did not go on toiling at the exercises that aim at professional\n\t\t\t\t\tcompetitions, nor the wonderful and elaborate performances which have now\n\t\t\t\t\tentered into the competitions and have passed from the competitions into\n\t\t\t\t\teducation, but also only practised exercises not of that sort until they are\n\t\t\t\t\table to enjoy beautiful tunes and rhythms, and not merely the charm common to\n\t\t\t\t\tall music, which even some lower animals enjoy, as well as a multitude of slaves\n\t\t\t\t\tand children. And it is also clear\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom these considerations what sort of instruments they should use. Flutes must\n\t\t\t\t\tnot be introduced into education, nor any other professional instrument, such as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe harp or any other of that sort, butsuch instruments as will make them attentive pupils either at their musical\n\t\t\t\t\ttraining or in their other lessons. Moreover the flute is not a moralizing but\n\t\t\t\t\trather an exciting influence, so that it ought to be used for occasions of the\n\t\t\t\t\tkind at which attendance has the effect of purification rather than\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstruction. And\n\t\t\t\t\tlet us add that the flute happens to possess the additional property telling\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst its use in education that playing it prevents the employment of speech.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence former ages rightly rejected its use by the young and the free, although\n\t\t\t\t\tat first they had employed it. For\n\t\t\t\t\tas they came to have more leisure because of their wealth and grew more\n\t\t\t\t\thigh-spirited and valorous, both at a still earlier date and because after the\n\t\t\t\t\tPersian Wars they were filled with pride as a result of their achievements, they\n\t\t\t\t\tbegan to engage in all branches of learning, making no distinction but pursuing\n\t\t\t\t\tresearch further. Because of this they even included flute-playing among their\n\t\t\t\t\tstudies; for in  a certain\n\t\t\t\t\tchorus-leader played the flute to his chorus himself, and at  it became so fashionable that almost the majority of\n\t\t\t\t\tfreemen went in for flute-playing, as is shown by the tablet erected by\n\t\t\t\t\tThrasippus after having provided the chorus for Ecphantides.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut later on it came to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdisapproved of as a result of actual experience, when men were more capable of\n\t\t\t\t\tjudging what music conduced to virtue and what did not; and similarly also many\n\t\t\t\t\tof the old instruments were disapproved of, like the pectis and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbarbitos and the instruments designed to give pleasure to those\n\t\t\t\t\twho hear people playing them, the septangle, the triangle and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsambyc,\n\t\t\t\t\tand all the instruments that require manual skill.And indeed there is a reasonable foundation for the story\n\t\t\t\t\tthat was told by the ancients about the flute. The tale goes that Athena found a\n\t\t\t\t\tflute and threw it away. Now it is not a bad point in the story that the goddess\n\t\t\t\t\tdid this out of annoyance because of the ugly distortion of her features; but as\n\t\t\t\t\ta matter of fact it is more likely that it was because education in\n\t\t\t\t\tflute-playing has no effect on the intelligence, whereas we attribute science\n\t\t\t\t\tand art to Athena.And since we reject professional education in the instruments\n\t\t\t\t\tand in performance and we count\n\t\t\t\t\tperformance in competitions as professional, for the performer does not take\n\t\t\t\t\tpart in it for his own improvement, but for his hearers' pleasure, and that a\n\t\t\t\t\tvulgar pleasure, owing to which we do not consider performing to be proper for\n\t\t\t\t\tfree men, but somewhat menial; and indeed performers do become vulgar, since the\n\t\t\t\t\tobject at which they aim is a low one, as vulgarity in the audience usually\n\t\t\t\t\tinfluences the music, so that it imparts to the artists who practise it with a\n\t\t\t\t\tview to suit the audience a special kind of personality, and also of bodily\n\t\t\t\t\tframe because of the movements requiredwe must therefore give some consideration to tunes\n\t\t\t\t\tand rhythms,and to the question\n\t\t\t\t\twhether for educational purposes we must employ all the tunes and all the\n\t\t\t\t\trhythms or make distinctions; and next, whether for those who are working at\n\t\t\t\t\tmusic for education we shall lay down the same regulation, or ought we to\n\t\t\t\t\testablish some other third one inasmuch as we see that the factors in\n\t\t\t\t\tmusic are melody and rhythm, and it is important to notice what influence each\n\t\t\t\t\tof these has upon education, and whether we are to prefer music with a\n\t\t\t\t\tgood melody or music with a good rhythm. Now we consider that much is well said on these matters by\n\t\t\t\t\tsome of the musicians of the present day and by some of those engaged in\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy who happen to be experienced in musical education, and we will\n\t\t\t\t\tabandon the precise discussion as to each of these matters for any who wish it\n\t\t\t\t\tto seek it from those teachers, while for the present let us lay down general\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples, merely stating the outlines of the subjects. And since we accept the classification of melodies\n\t\t\t\t\tmade by some philosophers, as ethical melodies, melodies of action, and\n\t\t\t\t\tpassionate melodies, distributing the various\n\t\t\t\t\tharmonies among these classes as being in nature akin to one or the other, and\n\t\t\t\t\tas we say that music ought to be employed not for the purpose of one benefit\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it confers but on account of several for it serves the purpose\n\t\t\t\t\tboth of education and of purgationthe term purgation we use for the\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent without explanation, but we will return to discuss the meaning that we\n\t\t\t\t\tgive to it more explicitly in our treatise on poetryand thirdly it serves for\n\t\t\t\t\tamusement, serving to relax our tension and to give rest from it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit is clear that we\n\t\t\t\t\tshould employ all the harmonies, yet not employ them all in the same way, but\n\t\t\t\t\tuse the most ethical ones for education, and the active and passionate kinds for\n\t\t\t\t\tlistening to when others are performing for any experience that occurs\n\t\t\t\t\tviolently in some souls is found in all, though with different degrees of\n\t\t\t\t\tintensityfor example pity and fear, and also religious excitement;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor some persons are very liable to this form of emotion, and under the\n\t\t\t\t\tinfluence of sacred music we see these people, when they use tunes that\n\t\t\t\t\tviolently arouse the soul, being thrown into a state as if they had received\n\t\t\t\t\tmedicinal treatment and taken a purge; the same experience then must come also to the\n\t\t\t\t\tcompassionate and the timid and the other emotional people generally in such\n\t\t\t\t\tdegree as befalls each individual of these classes, and all must undergo a\n\t\t\t\t\tpurgation and a pleasant feeling of relief; and similarly also the purgative\n\t\t\t\t\tmelodies afford harmless delight to people. Therefore those who go in\n\t\t\t\t\tfor theatrical music must be set to compete in harmonies and melodies of this\n\t\t\t\t\tkind and since the\n\t\t\t\t\taudience is of two classes, one freemen and educated people, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\totherthe vulgar class composed of\n\t\t\t\t\tmechanics and laborers and other such persons, the latter sort also must be\n\t\t\t\t\tassigned competitions and shows for relaxation; and just as their souls are\n\t\t\t\t\twarped from the natural state, so those harmonies and melodies that are highly\n\t\t\t\t\tstrung and irregular in coloration\n\t\t\t\t\tare deviations, but people of each sort receive pleasure from what is naturally\n\t\t\t\t\tsuited to them, owing to which the competitors before an audience of this sort\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be allowed to employ some such kind of music as this; but for education, as has been said, the ethical class of melodies\n\t\t\t\t\tand of harmonies must be employed. And of that nature is the Dorian mode, as we\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid before; but we must\n\t\t\t\t\talso accept any other mode that those who take part in the pursuit of philosophy\n\t\t\t\t\tand in musical education may recommend to us. Socrates in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t does not do well in allowing only the Phrygian mode along with the\n\t\t\t\t\tDorian, and that when he has rejected the flute among instruments; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tPhrygian mode has the same effect among harmonies as the flute among\n\t\t\t\t\tinstrumentsboth are violently exciting and emotional. This is shown by poetry; for all Bacchiac\n\t\t\t\t\tversification and all movement of that sort\n\t\t\t\t\tbelongs particularly to the flute among the instruments, and these meters find\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir suitable accompaniment in tunes in the Phrygian mode among the harmonies:\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example the dithyramb is admittedly held to be a Phrygian meter, and the\n\t\t\t\t\texperts on this subject adduce many instances to prove this, particularly the\n\t\t\t\t\tfact that Philoxenus when he attempted to compose a dithyramb, , in the Dorian mode\n\t\t\t\t\twas unable to do so, but merely by the force of nature fell back again into the\n\t\t\t\t\tsuitable harmony, the Phrygian. And\n\t\t\t\t\tall agree that the Dorian mode is more\n\t\t\t\t\tsedate and of a specially manly character. Moreover since we praise and say that\n\t\t\t\t\twe ought to pursue the mean between extremes, and the Dorian mode has this nature in relation to the\n\t\t\t\t\tother harmonies, it is clear that it suits the younger pupils to be educated\n\t\t\t\t\trather in the Dorian melodies. But\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are two objects to aim at, the possible as well as the suitable; for we\n\t\t\t\t\tare bound rather to attempt the things that are possible and those that are\n\t\t\t\t\tsuitable for the particular class of people concerned;and in these matters also there are dividing lines\n\t\t\t\t\tdrawn by the agesfor instance, those whose powers have waned through\n\t\t\t\t\tlapse of time cannot easily sing the highly strung harmonies, but to persons of\n\t\t\t\t\tthat age nature suggests the relaxed harmonies. Therefore some musical experts also rightly criticize\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSocrates because he disapproved of the relaxed harmonies for amusement, taking\n\t\t\t\t\tthem to have the character of intoxication, not in the sense of the effect of\n\t\t\t\t\tstrong drink, for that clearly has more the result of making men frenzied\n\t\t\t\t\trevellers, but as failing in power. Hence even with a view to the period of life\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is to follow, that of the comparatively old, it is proper to engage in the\n\t\t\t\t\tharmonies and melodies of this kind too, and also any kind of harmony that is\n\t\t\t\t\tsuited to the age of boyhood because it is capable of being at once decorous and\n\t\t\t\t\teducative, which seems to be the nature of the Lydian mode most of all the\n\t\t\t\t\tharmonies. It is clear therefore that we should lay down these three canons to\n\t\t\t\t\tguide education, moderation, possibility and suitability."}}]}}}}
