But we must\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider first what the good life consists in and how it is to be\n\t\t\t\t\tobtainedwhether all of those who receive the designation\n\t\t\t\t\t'happy' acquire happiness by nature, as is the case with tallness and\n\t\t\t\t\tshortness of stature and differences of complexion, or by study, which\n\t\t\t\t\twould imply that there is a science of happiness, or by some form of\n\t\t\t\t\ttraining,for there\n\t\t\t\t\tare many human attributes that are not bestowed by nature nor acquired\n\t\t\t\t\tby study but gained by habituationbad attributes by those\n\t\t\t\t\ttrained in bad habits and good attributes by those trained in good\n\t\t\t\t\tones.  Or does happiness\n\t\t\t\t\tcome in none of these ways, but either by a sort of elevation of mind\n\t\t\t\t\tinspired by some divine power, as in the case of persons possessed by\n\t\t\t\t\ta nymph or a god, or, alternatively, by fortune? for many people\n\t\t\t\t\tidentify happiness with good fortune.Now it is pretty\n\t\t\t\t\tclear that the presence of happiness is bestowed upon men by all of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese things, or by some or one of them; for almost all the modes in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it is produced fall under these principles, inasmuch as all the\n\t\t\t\t\tacts that spring from thought may be included with those that spring\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom knowledge.  But to be\n\t\t\t\t\thappy and to five blissfully and finely may consist chiefly in three\n\t\t\t\t\tthings deemed to be most desirable: some people say that Wisdom is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe greatest good, others Goodness and others\n\t\t\t\t\tPleasure.  And certain\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons debate about their importance in relation to happiness,\n\t\t\t\t\tdeclaring that one contributes more to it\n\t\t\t\t\tthan anothersome holding that Wisdom is a greater good than\n\t\t\t\t\tGoodness, others the reverse, and others that Pleasure is a greater\n\t\t\t\t\tgood than either of them; and some think that the happy life comes\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom them all, others from two of them, others that it consists in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome one of them.Having then in regard to this\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject established that everybody able to live according to his own\n\t\t\t\t\tpurposive choice should set before him some object for noble living to\n\t\t\t\t\taim ateither honor or else glory or wealth or\n\t\t\t\t\tcultureon which he will keep his eyes fixed in all his\n\t\t\t\t\tconduct (since clearly it is a mark of much folly not to have one's\n\t\t\t\t\tlife regulated with regard to some End),  it is therefore most necessary first to decide\n\t\t\t\t\twithin oneself, neither hastily nor carelessly, in which of the things\n\t\t\t\t\tthat belong to us the good life consists, and what are the\n\t\t\t\t\tindispensable conditions for men's possessing it. For there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinction between health and the things that are indispensable\n\t\t\t\t\tconditions of health,  and\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is similarly the case with many other things; consequently also\n\t\t\t\t\tto live finely is not the same as the things without which living\n\t\t\t\t\tfinely is impossible.  And\n\t\t\t\t\tin the latter class of things some that are indispensable conditions\n\t\t\t\t\tof health and life are not peculiar to special people but common to\n\t\t\t\t\tpractically all menboth some states and some\n\t\t\t\t\tactionsfor instance, without breathing or being awake or\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipating in movement we could not possess any good or any evil at\n\t\t\t\t\tall; whereas others are more peculiar to special types of natural\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitutionfor instance, eating meat and taking walking exercise after dinner\n\t\t\t\t\tare not closely related to health in the same way as the conditions\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned. And these facts must not be overlooked,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor these are the causes of the disputes about the real nature of\n\t\t\t\t\thappiness and about the means of procuring it; for some people regard\n\t\t\t\t\tthe things that are indispensable conditions of being happy as actual\n\t\t\t\t\tparts of happiness.Now to examine all the opinions\n\t\t\t\t\tthat any people hold about happiness is a superfluous task For children and the sick and\n\t\t\t\t\tinsane have many opinions which no sensible man would discuss, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthese persons need not argument but the former time in which to grow\n\t\t\t\t\tup and alter and the latter medical or official chastisement\n\t\t\t\t\t(treatment with drugs being chastisement just as much as flogging is).\n\t\t\t\t\t And similarly it is\n\t\t\t\t\talso superfluous to examine the opinions of the multitude either; for they\n\t\t\t\t\ttalk at random about almost everything, and especially about\n\t\t\t\t\thappiness. We ought to examine only the opinions of the wise; for it is out of place to apply reasoning to\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who do not need reasoning at all, but experience.  But since every subject has\n\t\t\t\t\tspecial difficulties related to it, it is clear that there are such in\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to the highest life and the best mode of existence; it is then\n\t\t\t\t\twell to examine the opinions putting these difficulties, since the\n\t\t\t\t\trefutations advanced by those who challenge them are demonstrations of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe theories that are opposed to them.Moreover to\n\t\t\t\t\tnotice such matters is especially advantageous with a view to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects to which all inquiry ought to be directedthe\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion what are the means that make it possible to participate in\n\t\t\t\t\tliving well and finely (if 'blissfully' is too invidious an\n\t\t\t\t\texpression)and with a view to the hope that we may have of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe things that are good in the various departments.  For if living finely depends\n\t\t\t\t\ton things that come by fortune or by nature, it would be beyond the\n\t\t\t\t\thopes of many men, for then its attainment is not to be secured by\n\t\t\t\t\teffort, and does not rest with men themselves and is not a matter of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir own conduct;  but if\n\t\t\t\t\tit consists in oneself and one's own actions having a particular\n\t\t\t\t\tquality, the good would be more common and more divinemore\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon because it would be possible for more people to share it, and\n\t\t\t\t\tmore divine because happiness would then be in store for those who\n\t\t\t\t\tmade themselves and their actions of a particular quality. Most of the points debated and the difficulties\n\t\t\t\t\traised will be clear if it be satisfactorily determined what the\n\t\t\t\t\tproper conception of happiness isdoes it consist merely in\n\t\t\t\t\ta person's possessing some particular quality of spirit, as some of the sages and the older thinkers\n\t\t\t\t\theld, or although a particular personal character is indeed an\n\t\t\t\t\tindispensable condition, is a particular quality of conduct even more\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary?There are various different modes of life,\n\t\t\t\t\tand some do not lay any claim to well-being of the kind under\n\t\t\t\t\tconsideration, but are pursued merely for the sake of things\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessaryfor instance the lives devoted to the vulgar and\n\t\t\t\t\tmechanic arts and those dealing with business (by vulgar arts I mean\n\t\t\t\t\tthose pursued only for reputation, by mechanic the sedentary and\n\t\t\t\t\twage-earning pursuits, and by arts of business those concerned with\n\t\t\t\t\tmarket purchase and retail selling); but on the other hand, the things\n\t\t\t\t\trelated to the happy conduct of life being three, the things already\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned as the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatest possible goods for mengoodness, wisdom and\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure, we see that there are also three ways of life in which those\n\t\t\t\t\tto whom fortune gives opportunity invariably choose to live, the life of\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitics, the\n\t\t\t\t\tlife of philosophy, and the life of enjoyment. Of these the\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophic life denotes being concerned with the contemplation of\n\t\t\t\t\ttruth, the political life means being occupied with honorable\n\t\t\t\t\tactivities (and these are the activities that spring from goodness),\n\t\t\t\t\tand the life of enjoyment is concerned with the pleasures of the body.\n\t\t\t\t\t Owing to this,\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent people give the name of happy to different persons, as was\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid before too; and Anaxagoras of Clazomenae\n\t\t\t\t\twhen asked 'Who is the happiest man?' said 'None of those whom you\n\t\t\t\t\tthink, but he would seem to you an odd sort of person.' But Anaxagoras\n\t\t\t\t\tanswered in that way because he saw that the man who put the question\n\t\t\t\t\tsupposed it to be impossible to receive the appellation 'happy'\n\t\t\t\t\twithout being great and beautiful or rich, whereas he himself perhaps\n\t\t\t\t\tthought that the person who humanly speaking enjoys bliss is he that\n\t\t\t\t\tlives by the standard of justice without pain and in purity, or\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipates in some form of divine contemplation.While there are many\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent things as to which it is not easy to make a right judgement,\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is especially the case with one about which everybody thinks that\n\t\t\t\t\tit is very easy to judge and that anybody can decidethe\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion which of the things contained in being alive is preferable,\n\t\t\t\t\tand which when attained would fully satisfy a man's desire. For many\n\t\t\t\t\tof life's events are such that they cause men to throw life\n\t\t\t\t\taway,for instance,\n\t\t\t\t\tdiseases, excessive pains, storms; so that it is clear that on account\n\t\t\t\t\tof these things any way it would actually be preferable, if someone\n\t\t\t\t\toffered us the choice, not to be born at all. And in addition, the kind of life that people live\n\t\t\t\t\twhile still children is not desirablein fact no sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tperson could endure to go back to it again.  And further, many of the\n\t\t\t\t\texperiences that contain no pleasure nor pain, and also of those that\n\t\t\t\t\tdo contain pleasure but pleasure of an ignoble kind, are such that\n\t\t\t\t\tnon-existence would be better than being alive.  And generally, if one\n\t\t\t\t\tcollected together the whole of the things that the whole of mankind\n\t\t\t\t\tdo and experience yet do and experience unwillingly, because not for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of the things themselves, and if one added an infinite extent\n\t\t\t\t\tof time, these things would not cause a man to choose to be alive\n\t\t\t\t\trather than not alive. \n\t\t\t\t\tBut moreover, also the pleasure of food or of sex alone, with the\n\t\t\t\t\tother pleasures abstracted that knowledge or sight or any other of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses provides for human beings, would not induce anybody to value\n\t\t\t\t\tlife higher if he were not utterly slavish, for it is clear that to\n\t\t\t\t\tone making this choice there would be no difference between being born\n\t\t\t\t\ta beast or a man;  at all\n\t\t\t\t\tevents, the ox in ,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich they reverence as Apis, has a greater\n\t\t\t\t\tabundance of such indulgences than many monarchs.  Nor likewise would anyone\n\t\t\t\t\tdesire life for the pleasure of sleep either; for what is the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference between slumbering without being awakened from the first\n\t\t\t\t\tday till the last of a thousand or any number of years, and living a\n\t\t\t\t\tvegetable existence? any way plants seem to participate in life of\n\t\t\t\t\tthat kind; and so do children too, inasmuch as at their first\n\t\t\t\t\tprocreation in the mother, although alive, they stay asleep all the\n\t\t\t\t\ttime.  So that it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom considerations of this sort that the precise nature of well-being\n\t\t\t\t\tand of the good in life escapes our investigation.Now it is said that when somebody persisted in putting various\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties of this sort to Anaxagoras and went on asking for what object one should choose\n\t\t\t\t\tto come into existence rather than not, he replied by saying, 'For the\n\t\t\t\t\tsake of contemplating the heavens and the whole order of the\n\t\t\t\t\tuniverse.' Anaxagoras therefore thought that the alternative of being\n\t\t\t\t\talive was valuable for the sake of some kind of knowledge;  but those who ascribe bliss\n\t\t\t\t\tto Sardanapallus or Smindyrides of  or some of the others living the life of enjoyment,\n\t\t\t\t\tall appear for their part to place happiness in delight; while a different set would not choose either\n\t\t\t\t\twisdom of any kind or the bodily pleasures in preference to the\n\t\t\t\t\tactions that spring from goodness: at all events, some people choose\n\t\t\t\t\tthose actions not only for the sake of reputation but even when they\n\t\t\t\t\tare not going to get any credit.  But the majority of those engaged in politics are not\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrectly designated 'politicians,' for they are not truly political,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince the political man is one who purposely chooses noble actions for\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir own sake, whereas the majority embrace that mode of life for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsake of money and gain.What has been said, therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstrates that all men ascribe happiness to three modes of\n\t\t\t\t\tlifethe political, the philosophic, and the life of\n\t\t\t\t\tenjoyment. Among these,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe nature and quality of the pleasure connected with the body and\n\t\t\t\t\twith enjoyment, and the means that procure it, are not hard to see; so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is not necessary for us to inquire what these pleasures are,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut whether they conduce at all to happiness or not, and how they so\n\t\t\t\t\tconduce, and, if it be the case that the noble life ought to have some\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasures attached to it, whether these are the pleasures that ought\n\t\t\t\t\tto be attached, or whether these must be enjoyed in some other way,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas the pleasures which people reasonably believe to make the\n\t\t\t\t\thappy man's life pleasant and not merely painless are different\n\t\t\t\t\tones.But these matters must be examined\n\t\t\t\t\tlater. Let us first consider\n\t\t\t\t\tGoodness and Wisdomwhat the\n\t\t\t\t\tnature of each is, and also whether they themselves or the actions\n\t\t\t\t\tthat spring from them are parts of the good life, since that they are connected with happiness is asserted,\n\t\t\t\t\tif not by everybody, at all events by all of mankind who are worthy of\n\t\t\t\t\tconsideration.Accordingly Socrates the\n\t\t\t\t\tsenior thought that the End is to get to know\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue, and he pursued an inquiry into the nature of justice and\n\t\t\t\t\tcourage and each of the divisions of virtue. And this was a reasonable\n\t\t\t\t\tprocedure, since he thought that all the virtues are forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge, so that knowing justice and being just must go together,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor as soon as we have learnt geometry and architecture, we are\n\t\t\t\t\tarchitects and geometricians; owing to which he used to inquire what\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue is, but not how and from what sources it is produced.\n\t\t\t\t\t But although this\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes happen in the case of the theoretical sciences, inasmuch as\n\t\t\t\t\tastronomy and natural science and\n\t\t\t\t\tgeometry have no other End except to get to know and to contemplate\n\t\t\t\t\tthe nature of the things that are the subjects of the sciences\n\t\t\t\t\t(although it is true that they may quite possibly be useful to us\n\t\t\t\t\taccidentally for many of our necessary requirements),  yet the End of the productive\n\t\t\t\t\tsciences is something different from science and knowledge, for\n\t\t\t\t\texample the End of medicine is health and that of political science\n\t\t\t\t\tordered government, or something of that sort, different from mere\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge of the science.  Although, therefore, it is fine even to attain a knowledge of the\n\t\t\t\t\tvarious fine things,all the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame nevertheless in the case of goodness it is not the knowledge of\n\t\t\t\t\tits essential nature that is most valuable but the ascertainment of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sources that produce it. For our aim is not to know what courage\n\t\t\t\t\tis but to be courageous, not to know what justice is but to be just,\n\t\t\t\t\tin the same way as we want to be healthy rather than to ascertain what\n\t\t\t\t\thealth is, and to be in good condition of body rather than to\n\t\t\t\t\tascertain what good bodily condition is.And about all\n\t\t\t\t\tthese matters the endeavor must be made to seek to convince by means\n\t\t\t\t\tof rational arguments, using observed facts as evidences and examples.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the best thing would be if all mankind were seen to be in\n\t\t\t\t\tagreement with the views that will be stated, but failing that, at any\n\t\t\t\t\trate that all should agree in some way. And this they will do if led\n\t\t\t\t\tto change their ground, for everyone has something\n\t\t\t\t\trelative to contribute to the truth, and we must start from this to\n\t\t\t\t\tgive a sort of proof about our views; for from statements that are\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue but not clearly expressed, as we advance, clearness will also be\n\t\t\t\t\tattained, if at every stage we adopt more scientific positions in\n\t\t\t\t\texchange for the customary confused statements.  And in every investigation\n\t\t\t\t\targuments stated in philosophical form are different from those that\n\t\t\t\t\tare non-philosophical; hence we must not think that theoretical study\n\t\t\t\t\tof such a sort as to make manifest not only the nature of a thing but\n\t\t\t\t\talso its cause is superfluous even for the political student, since\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is the philosophic procedure in every field of inquiry.\n\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless this requires much caution. For because to say nothing at\n\t\t\t\t\trandom but use reasoned argument seems to mark a philosopher, some\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople often without being detected advance arguments that are not\n\t\t\t\t\tgermane to the subject under treatment and that have nothing in them\n\t\t\t\t\t (and they do this\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes through ignorance and sometimes from charlatanry), which\n\t\t\t\t\tbring it about that even men of experience and practical capacity are\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken in by these people, who neither possess nor are capable of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstructive or practical thought.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd this befalls them owing to lack of educationfor in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect of each subject inability to distinguish arguments germane to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subject from those foreign to it is lack of education.  And it is also well to judge\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately the statement of the cause and the demonstrated fact, both\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the reason stated just now, that it is not proper in regard to all things to\n\t\t\t\t\tattend to theoretical arguments, but often rather to the facts of\n\t\t\t\t\tobservation (whereas now when men are unable to refute an argument\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are forced to believe what has been said), and also because\n\t\t\t\t\toften, although the result that seems to have been proved by the\n\t\t\t\t\targuments is true, it is not true because of the cause asserted in the\n\t\t\t\t\targument. For it is possible to prove truth by falsehood, as is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom .These prefatory\n\t\t\t\t\tremarks having also been made, let us proceed by starting first from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe firststatements, which, as has been said, are not clearly expressed,afterwards seeking to discover clearly the essential\n\t\t\t\t\tnature of happiness.  Now\n\t\t\t\t\tit is agreed that happiness is the greatest and best of human goods\n\t\t\t\t\t(and we say 'human' because there might very likely also be a\n\t\t\t\t\thappiness belonging to some higher being, for instance a god);\n\t\t\t\t\t since none of the\n\t\t\t\t\tother animals, which are inferior in nature to men, share in the\n\t\t\t\t\tdesignation 'happy,' for a horse is not happy, nor is a bird nor a\n\t\t\t\t\tfish nor any other existing thing whose designation does not indicate\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it possesses in its nature a share of something divine, but it is\n\t\t\t\t\tby some other mode of participating in things good that one of them\n\t\t\t\t\thas a better life and another a worse.But the fact that\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is so must be considered later. At the present\n\t\t\t\t\tlet us say that among things good some are within the range of action\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a human being and others are not. And we make this distinction for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe reason that some existing things do not participate in change at\n\t\t\t\t\tall, and therefore some good things do not, and these are perhaps in\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir nature the best things; and some things, though practicable, are\n\t\t\t\t\tonly practicable for beings superior to us.  And inasmuch as 'practicable'\n\t\t\t\t\thas two meanings (for both the Ends for which we act and the actions\n\t\t\t\t\tthat we do as means to those Ends have to do with actionfor\n\t\t\t\t\texample we class among things practicable both health and wealth and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe pursuits that are followed for the sake of health and wealth,\n\t\t\t\t\thealthy exercise and lucrative business), it is clear that happiness\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be set down as the best of the things practicable for a human\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing. We must consider, therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\twhat the best is, and in how many senses the term is used. The answer\n\t\t\t\t\tseems to be principally contained in three views. For it is said that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best of all things is the Absolute Good, and that the Absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tGood is that which has the attributes of being the first of goods and\n\t\t\t\t\tof being by its presence the cause to the other goods of their being\n\t\t\t\t\tgood;  and both of these\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes, it is said, belong to the Form of good (I mean both being the first of goods\n\t\t\t\t\tand being by its presence the cause to the other goods of their being\n\t\t\t\t\tgood), since it is of that Form that goodness is most truly predicated\n\t\t\t\t\t(inasmuch as the other goods are good by participation in and\n\t\t\t\t\tresemblance to the Form of good) and also it is the first of goods,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the destruction of that which is participated in involves the\n\t\t\t\t\tdestruction of the things participating in the Form (which get their\n\t\t\t\t\tdesignation by participating in it),  and that is the relation existing between what\n\t\t\t\t\tis primary and what is subsequent; so that the Form of good is the\n\t\t\t\t\tAbsolute Good, inasmuch as the Form of good is separable from the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings that participate in it, as are the other Forms also.Now a thorough examination of this opinion belongs to another course\n\t\t\t\t\tof study, and one that for the most part necessarily lies more in the\n\t\t\t\t\tfield of Logic, for that is the only science dealing with arguments\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are at the same time destructive and general.  But if we are to speak about\n\t\t\t\t\tit concisely,we say that in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first place to assert the existence of a Form not only of good but\n\t\t\t\t\tof anything else is an expression of logic and a mere abstraction (but\n\t\t\t\t\tthis has been considered in various ways both in extraneous\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscourses and in those on\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophical lines); \n\t\t\t\t\tnext, even granting that Forms and the Form of good exist in the\n\t\t\t\t\tfullest sense, surely this is of no practical value for the good life\n\t\t\t\t\tor for conduct.For 'good' has many senses, in fact as many\n\t\t\t\t\tas 'being.' For the term 'is,' as it has been analyzed in other works,\n\t\t\t\t\tsignifies now substance, now quality, now quantity, now time, and in\n\t\t\t\t\taddition to these meanings it consists now in undergoing change and\n\t\t\t\t\tnow in causing it; and the good is found in each of these casesin\n\t\t\t\t\tessence, as mind and God, in quality justice, in quantity moderation,\n\t\t\t\t\tin time opportunity, and as instances of change, the teacher and the\n\t\t\t\t\ttaught.  Therefore, just\n\t\t\t\t\tas being is not some one thing in respect of the categories mentioned,\n\t\t\t\t\tso neither is the good, and there is no one science either of the real\n\t\t\t\t\tor of the good. But also even the goods predicated in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tcategory, for example opportunity or moderation, do not fall within\n\t\t\t\t\tthe province of a single science to study, but different sorts of\n\t\t\t\t\topportunity and of moderation are studied by different sciences, for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance opportunity and moderation in respect of food are studied by\n\t\t\t\t\tmedicine and gymnastics, in respect of military operations by\n\t\t\t\t\tstrategics, and similarly in respect of another pursuit by another\n\t\t\t\t\tscience; so that it can hardly be the case that the Absolute Good is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subject of only one science. Again, wherever there is a sequence of factors, a prior and a\n\t\t\t\t\tsubsequent, there is not some common element beside these factors and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat element separable; \n\t\t\t\t\tfor then there would be something prior to the first in the series,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the common and separable term would be prior because when the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon element was destroyed the first factor would be destroyed. For\n\t\t\t\t\texample, if double is the first of the multiples, the multiplicity\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicated of them in common cannot exist as a separable thing, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthen it will be prior to double, if it is the case that the common\n\t\t\t\t\telement is the Form, as it would be if one were to make the common\n\t\t\t\t\telement separable: for if justice is a good, and courage, there is\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, they say, a Good-in-itself,  so the term 'in itself' is added to the common\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition. But what could this denote except that the good is eternal\n\t\t\t\t\tand separable? Yet a thing that is white for days is no more white\n\t\t\t\t\tthan a thing that is white for one day, so that the good is no more\n\t\t\t\t\tgood by being eternal; nor yet therefore is the common good the same\n\t\t\t\t\tas the Form, for it is the common property of all the goods.Also the proper method of proving the Absolute Good is the contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tof the method now adopted. At present it is from things not admitted\n\t\t\t\t\tto possess goodness that they prove the things admitted to be good,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor instance, they prove from numbers that justice and health are\n\t\t\t\t\tgood, because they are arrangements and numberson the assumption that goodness\n\t\t\t\t\tis a property of numbers and monads because the Absolute Good is\n\t\t\t\t\tunity.  But the proper\n\t\t\t\t\tmethod is to start from things admitted to be good, for instance\n\t\t\t\t\thealth, strength, sobriety of mind, and prove that beauty is present\n\t\t\t\t\teven more in the unchanging; for all these admitted goods consist in\n\t\t\t\t\torder and rest, and therefore, if that is so, the things unchanging\n\t\t\t\t\tare good in an even greater degree, for they possess order and rest in\n\t\t\t\t\ta greater degree. And it is a hazardous way of proving that the\n\t\t\t\t\tAbsolute Good is unity to say that numbers aim at unity; for it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tclearly stated how they aim at it, but the expression is used in too\n\t\t\t\t\tunqualified a manner; and how can one suppose that things not\n\t\t\t\t\tpossessing life can have appetition?  One ought to study this matter carefully, and\n\t\t\t\t\tnot make an unreasoned assumption about something as to which it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot easy to attain certainty even with the aid of\n\t\t\t\t\treason.And the statement that all existing things desire\n\t\t\t\t\tsome one good is not true; each thing seeks its own particular good,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe eye sight, the body health, and similarly another thing another\n\t\t\t\t\tgood.Such then are the difficulties indicating\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the Absolute Good does not exist,and that it is of no\n\t\t\t\t\tuse for political science, but that this has a special good of its\n\t\t\t\t\town, as have the other sciences alsofor instance the good\n\t\t\t\t\tof gymnastics is good bodily condition.Further\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is also what has been written in the discourse: either the\n\t\t\t\t\tClass-form of the good is in itself useful to no science, or it is\n\t\t\t\t\tuseful to all alike.Further it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tpracticable.And similarly the good as\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal also is not an Absolute Good (for\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversality might be an attribute of even a small good), and also it\n\t\t\t\t\tis not practicable; for medical science does not study how to procure\n\t\t\t\t\tan attribute that belongs to anything, but how to procure health, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly also each of the other practical sciences.  But 'good' has many meanings,\n\t\t\t\t\tand there is a part of it that is beautiful, and one form of it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpracticable but another is not. The sort of good that is practicable\n\t\t\t\t\tis that which is an object aimed at, but the good in things\n\t\t\t\t\tunchangeable is not practicable. It is manifest, therefore, that the\n\t\t\t\t\tAbsolute Good we are looking for is not the Form of good, nor yet the\n\t\t\t\t\tgood as universal, for the Form is unchangeable and impracticable, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe universal good though changeable is not practicable. But the\n\t\t\t\t\tobject aimed at as End is the chief good, and is the cause of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubordinate goods and first of all;  so that the Absolute Good would be thisthe\n\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the goods practicable for man. And this is the good that comes\n\t\t\t\t\tunder the supreme of all the practical sciences, which is Politics and\n\t\t\t\t\tEconomics and Wisdom; for these states of character differ from the\n\t\t\t\t\tothers in the fact that they are supreme (whether they differ at all\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom one another must be discussed later on).  And that the End stands in a causal relation to the\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans subordinate to it is shown by the method of teachers; they prove\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the various means are each good by first defining the End,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the End aimed at is a cause: for example, since to be in\n\t\t\t\t\thealth is so-and-so, what contributes to health must necessarily be\n\t\t\t\t\tso-and-so;the\n\t\t\t\t\twholesome is the efficient cause of health, though only the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tits existingit is not the cause of health's being a good.\n\t\t\t\t\t Furthermore nobody\n\t\t\t\t\tproves that health is a good (unless he is a sophist and not a\n\t\t\t\t\tphysicianit is sophists that juggle with irrelevant\n\t\t\t\t\targuments), any more than he proves any other first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple.After this we must take\n\t\t\t\t\ta fresh starting-point and consider, in regard to the good as End for\n\t\t\t\t\tman and in regard to the best of practicable goods, how many senses\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are of the term 'best of all,' since this is best."}}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "2", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "1218b"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed":

For Wisdom and Goodness and Pleasure are\n\t\t\t\t\tin the spirit, and either some or all of these are thought by\n\t\t\t\t\teverybody to be an End. And the contents of the spirit are in two\n\t\t\t\t\tgroups, one states or faculties, the other activities and\n\t\t\t\t\tprocesses.Let these assumptions, then, be made, and\n\t\t\t\t\tlet it be assumed as to Goodness that it is the best disposition or\n\t\t\t\t\tstate or faculty of each class of things that have some use or work.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is clear from induction, for we posit\n\t\t\t\t\tthis in all cases: for instance, there is a goodness that belongs to a\n\t\t\t\t\tcoat, for a coat has a particular function and use, and the best state\n\t\t\t\t\tof a coat is its goodness; and similarly with a ship and a house and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rest. So that the same is true also of the spirit, for it has a\n\t\t\t\t\twork of its own.  And\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore let us assume that the better the state is the better is the\n\t\t\t\t\twork of that state, and that as states stand in relation to one\n\t\t\t\t\tanother so do the works that result from them.  And the work of each thing is\n\t\t\t\t\tits End; from this, therefore, it is plain that the work is a greater\n\t\t\t\t\tgood than the state, for the End is the best as being an End, since\n\t\t\t\t\tthe greatest good is assumed as an End and as the ultimate object for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of which all the other things exist. It is clear, therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the work is a greater good than the state and disposition.\n\t\t\t\t\t But the term 'work'\n\t\t\t\t\thas two meanings; for some things have a work that is something\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent from the employment of them, for instance the work of\n\t\t\t\t\tarchitecture is a house, not the act of building, that of medicine\n\t\t\t\t\thealth, not the process of healing or curing, whereas with other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings their work is the process of using them, for instance the work\n\t\t\t\t\tof sight is the act of seeing, that of mathematical science the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontemplation of mathematical truths. So it follows that with the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings whose work is the employment of them, the act of employing them\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be of more value than the state of possessing them.And these points having been decided in this way,we say that the same work\n\t\t\t\t\tbelongs to a thing and to its goodness (although not in the same way):\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example, a shoe is the work of the art of shoemaking and of the\n\t\t\t\t\tact of shoemaking; so if there is such a thing as shoemaking goodness\n\t\t\t\t\tand a good shoemaker, their work is a good shoe; and in the same way\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of the other arts also.Again, let us grant that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe work of the spirit is to cause life, and that being alive is\n\t\t\t\t\temployment and being awake (for sleep is a kind of inactivity and\n\t\t\t\t\trest); with the consequence that since the work of the spirit and that\n\t\t\t\t\tof its goodness are necessarily one and the same, the work of goodness\n\t\t\t\t\twould be good life. Therefore this is the perfect good, which as we\n\t\t\t\t\tsaw is happiness.  And it\n\t\t\t\t\tis clear from the assumptions laid down (for we said that happiness is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe greatest good and that the Ends or the greatest of goods are in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe spirit, but things in the spirit are either a state or an\n\t\t\t\t\tactivity) that, since an activity is a better thing than a disposition\n\t\t\t\t\tand the best activity than the best state, and since goodness is the\n\t\t\t\t\tbest state, the activity of goodness is the spirit's greatest good.\n\t\t\t\t\t But also we saw\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the greatest good is happiness. Therefore happiness is the\n\t\t\t\t\tactivity of a good spirit. And since we saw that happiness is something perfect, and\n\t\t\t\t\tlife is either perfect or imperfect, and the same with goodness (for\n\t\t\t\t\tsome goodness is a whole and some a part), but the activity of\n\t\t\t\t\timperfect things is imperfect, it would follow that happiness is an\n\t\t\t\t\tactivity of perfect life in accordance with perfect\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness.And that our classification and definition\n\t\t\t\t\tof it are correct is evidenced by opinions that we all hold.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor we think that to do well and live well\n\t\t\t\t\tare the same as to be happy; but each of these, both life and action,\n\t\t\t\t\tis employment and activity, inasmuch as active life involves employing\n\t\t\t\t\tthingsthe coppersmith makes a bridle, but the horseman uses\n\t\t\t\t\tit. There is also the evidence of the opinion that a person is not\n\t\t\t\t\thappy for one day only,\n\t\t\t\t\tand that a child is not happy, nor any period of life(hence also Solon's advice holds good, not to call a man\n\t\t\t\t\thappy while he is alive, but only when he has reached the end), for\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing incomplete is happy, since it is not a whole.  And again, there are the\n\t\t\t\t\tpraises given to goodness on account of its deeds, and panegyrics\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribing deeds (and it is the victorious who are given wreaths, not\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who are capable of winning but do not win); and there is the\n\t\t\t\t\tfact that we judge a man's character from his actions.  Also why is happiness not\n\t\t\t\t\tpraised? It is because it is on account of it that the other things\n\t\t\t\t\tare praised, either by being placed in relation to it or as being\n\t\t\t\t\tparts of it. Hence felicitation, praise and panegyric are different\n\t\t\t\t\tthings: panegyric is a recital of a particular exploit, praise a\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement of a man's general distinction, felicitation is bestowed on\n\t\t\t\t\tan end achieved.  From\n\t\t\t\t\tthese considerations light is also thrown on the question sometimes\n\t\t\t\t\traisedwhat is the precise reason why the virtuous are for\n\t\t\t\t\thalf their lives no better than the base, since all men are alike when\n\t\t\t\t\tasleep?The reason is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat sleep is inaction of the spirit, not an activity.  Hence the goodness of any\n\t\t\t\t\tother part of the spirit, for instance the nutritive, is not a portion\n\t\t\t\t\tof goodness as a whole, just as also goodness of the body is not; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe nutritive part functions more actively in sleep, where as the\n\t\t\t\t\tsensory and appetitive parts are ineffective in sleep. But even the\n\t\t\t\t\timaginations of the virtuous, so far as the imaginative faculty\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipates in any mode of motion, are better than those of the base,\n\t\t\t\t\tprovided they are not perverted by disease or mutilation.Next we must study the spirit; for goodness is a property of the\n\t\t\t\t\tspirit, it is not accidental. And since it is human goodness that we\n\t\t\t\t\tare investigating, let us begin by positing that the spirit has two\n\t\t\t\t\tparts that partake of reason, but that they do not both partake of\n\t\t\t\t\treason in the same manner, but one of them by having by nature the\n\t\t\t\t\tcapacity to give orders, and the other to obey and listen (let us\n\t\t\t\t\tleave out any part that is irrational in another way).  And it makes no difference\n\t\t\t\t\twhether the spirit is divisible or is undivided yet possessed of\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent capacities, namely those mentioned, just as the concave and\n\t\t\t\t\tconvex sides in a curve are inseparable, and the straightness and\n\t\t\t\t\twhiteness in a straight white line, although a straight thing is not\n\t\t\t\t\twhite except accidentally and not by its own essence.  And we have also abstracted\n\t\t\t\t\tany other part of the spirit that there may be, for instance the\n\t\t\t\t\tfactor of growth; for the parts that we have mentioned are the special\n\t\t\t\t\tproperties of the human spirit, and hence the excellences of the part\n\t\t\t\t\tdealing with nutrition and growth are not the special property of a\n\t\t\t\t\tman, for necessarily, if considered as a man, he must possess a\n\t\t\t\t\treasoning faculty for a principle and with a view to conduct,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the reasoning faculty is a principle\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrolling not reasoning but appetite and passions;  therefore he must necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\tpossess those parts. And just as a good constitution consists of the\n\t\t\t\t\tseparate excellences of the parts of the body, so also the goodness of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe spirit, as being an End, is composed of the separate\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtues.And goodness has two forms, moral virtue and\n\t\t\t\t\tintellectual excellence; for we praise not only the just but also the\n\t\t\t\t\tintelligent and the wise. For we assumed that what is praiseworthy is either goodness\n\t\t\t\t\tor its work, and these are not activities but possess activities.\n\t\t\t\t\t And since the\n\t\t\t\t\tintellectual excellences involve reason, these forms of goodness\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to the rational part, which as having reason is in command of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe spirit; whereas the moral virtues belong to the part that is\n\t\t\t\t\tirrational but by nature capable of following the\n\t\t\t\t\trationalfor in stating a man's moral qualities we do not\n\t\t\t\t\tsay that he is wise or clever but that he is gentle or rash.After this we must first consider Moral Goodnessits\n\t\t\t\t\tessence and the nature of its divisions (for that is the subject now\n\t\t\t\t\tarrived at), and the means by which it is produced. Our method of\n\t\t\t\t\tinquiry then must be that employed by all people in other matters when\n\t\t\t\t\tthey have something in hand to start withwe must endeavor\n\t\t\t\t\tby means of statements that are true but not clearly expressed to\n\t\t\t\t\tarrive at a result that is both true and clear.  For our present state is as\n\t\t\t\t\tif we knew that health is the best disposition of the body and that\n\t\t\t\t\tCoriscus is the\n\t\t\t\t\tdarkest man in the market-place;for that is not to know what health is and who Coriscus\n\t\t\t\t\tis, but nevertheless to be in that state is a help towards knowing\n\t\t\t\t\teach of these things. Then let it first be taken as granted that the best\n\t\t\t\t\tdisposition is produced by the best means, and that the best actions\n\t\t\t\t\tin each department of conduct result from the excellences belonging to\n\t\t\t\t\teach departmentfor example, it is the best exercises and\n\t\t\t\t\tfood that produce a good condition of body, and a good condition of\n\t\t\t\t\tbody enables men to do the best work;  further, that every disposition is both\n\t\t\t\t\tproduced and destroyed by the same things applied in a certain manner,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example health by food and exercises and climate; these points are\n\t\t\t\t\tclear from induction. Therefore goodness too is the sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tdisposition that is created by the best movements in the spirit and is\n\t\t\t\t\talso the source of the production of the spirit's best actions and\n\t\t\t\t\temotions;  and it is in\n\t\t\t\t\tone way produced and in another way destroyed by the same things, and\n\t\t\t\t\tits employment of the things that cause both its increase and its\n\t\t\t\t\tdestruction is directed towards the things towards which it creates\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best disposition. And this is indicated by the fact that both\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness and badness have to do with things pleasant and painful; for\n\t\t\t\t\tpunishments, which are medicines, and which as is the case with other\n\t\t\t\t\tcures operate by\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans of opposites, operate by means of pleasures and pains.It is clear, therefore, that Moral Goodness has to do with pleasures\n\t\t\t\t\tand pains. And since moral character is, as even its\n\t\t\t\t\tname implies that it has its growth from habit, and by our often moving in\n\t\t\t\t\ta certain way a habit not innate in us is finally trained to be\n\t\t\t\t\toperative in that way (which we do not observe in inanimate objects,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor not even if you throw a stone upwards ten thousand times will it\n\t\t\t\t\tever rise upward unless under the operation of force)let\n\t\t\t\t\tmoral character then be defined as a quality of the spirit in\n\t\t\t\t\taccordance with governing reason that is capable of following the\n\t\t\t\t\treason.  We have then to\n\t\t\t\t\tsay what is the part of the spirit in respect of which our moral\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacters are of a certain quality.  And it will be in respect of our faculties for\n\t\t\t\t\temotions according to which people are termed liable to some emotion,\n\t\t\t\t\tand also of the states of character according to which people receive\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain designations in respect of the emotions, because of their\n\t\t\t\t\texperiencing or being exempt from some form of emotion.After this comes the classification, made in previous\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussions, of the modes of emotion, the faculties\n\t\t\t\t\tand the states of character. By emotions I mean such things as anger,\n\t\t\t\t\tfear, shame, desire, and generally those experiences that are in\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves usually accompanied by sensory pleasure or pain.  And to these there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tquality corresponding [but they are passive]. But quality\n\t\t\t\t\tcorresponds to the faculties: by faculties I mean the properties\n\t\t\t\t\tacting by which persons are designated by the names of the various\n\t\t\t\t\temotions, for instance choleric, insensitive, erotic, bashful,\n\t\t\t\t\tshameless. States of character are the states that cause the emotions\n\t\t\t\t\tto be present either rationally or the opposite:for example courage, sobriety of mind,\n\t\t\t\t\tcowardice, profligacy.These distinctions having been\n\t\t\t\t\testablished, it must be grasped that in every continuum that is\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisible there is excess and deficiency and a mean, and these either\n\t\t\t\t\tin relation to one another or in relation to us, for instance in\n\t\t\t\t\tgymnastics or medicine or architecture or navigation, and in any\n\t\t\t\t\tpractical pursuit of whatever sort, both scientific and unscientific,\n\t\t\t\t\tboth technical and untechnical;  for motion is a continuum, and conduct is a motion.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd in all things the mean in relation to us is the best, for that is\n\t\t\t\t\tas knowledge and reason bid. And everywhere this also produces the\n\t\t\t\t\tbest state. This is proved by induction and reason: contraries are\n\t\t\t\t\tmutually destructive, and extremes are contrary both to each other and\n\t\t\t\t\tto the mean, as the mean is either extreme in relation to the\n\t\t\t\t\totherfor example the equal is greater than the less and\n\t\t\t\t\tless than the greater. \n\t\t\t\t\tHence moral goodness must be concerned with certain means and must be\n\t\t\t\t\ta middle state. We must, therefore, ascertain what sort of middle\n\t\t\t\t\tstate is goodness and with what sort of means it is concerned.\n\t\t\t\t\t Let each then be\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken by way of illustration and studied with the help of the\n\t\t\t\t\tschedule: \n\t\t\t\t\tThese and such as these are the emotions\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the spirit experiences, and they are all designated from being\n\t\t\t\t\teither excessive or defective. The man that gets angry more and more\n\t\t\t\t\tquickly and with more people than he ought is irascible, he that in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect of persons and occasions and manner is deficient in anger is\n\t\t\t\t\tinsensitive; the man that is not afraid of things of which he ought to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe afraid, nor when nor as he ought, is rash,  he that is afraid of things of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich he ought not to be afraid, and when and as he ought not to be,\n\t\t\t\t\tis cowardly.Similarly also one that is a prey to his desires and that exceeds in\n\t\t\t\t\teverything possible is profligate, and one that is deficient and does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot desire even to a proper degree and in a natural way, but is as\n\t\t\t\t\tdevoid of feeling as a stone, is insensitive. The\n\t\t\t\t\tman that seeks gain from every source is a profiteer, and he that\n\t\t\t\t\tseeks gain if not from no source, yet from few, is a waster. He that pretends to have more\n\t\t\t\t\tpossessions than he really has is a boaster, and he that pretends to\n\t\t\t\t\thave fewer is a self-depreciator.  One that joins in approval more than is fitting is a\n\t\t\t\t\tflatterer, one that does so less than is fitting is surly. To be too\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplaisant is subservience; to be complaisant seldom and reluctantly\n\t\t\t\t\tis stubbornness.  Again,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe man that endures no pain, not even if it is good for him, is\n\t\t\t\t\tluxurious; one that can endure all pain alike is strictly speaking\n\t\t\t\t\tnameless, but by metaphor he is called hard, patient or enduring.\n\t\t\t\t\t He that rates\n\t\t\t\t\thimself too high is vain, he that rates himself too low,\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall-spirited. Again, he that exceeds in all expenditure is prodigal,\n\t\t\t\t\the that falls short in all, mean.  Similarly the shabby man and the\n\t\t\t\t\tswaggererthe latter exceeds what is fitting and the former\n\t\t\t\t\tfalls below it. The rascal grasps profit by every means and from every\n\t\t\t\t\tsource, the simpleton does not make profit even from the proper\n\t\t\t\t\tsources.  Envy consists\n\t\t\t\t\tin being annoyed at prosperity more often than one ought to be, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe envious are annoyed by the prosperity even of those who deserve to\n\t\t\t\t\tprosper; the opposite character is less definitely named, but it is the man that goes too far in not being annoyed\n\t\t\t\t\teven at the prosperity of the undeserving, and is easy going, as\n\t\t\t\t\tgluttons are in regard to food, whereas his opposite is\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult-tempered in respect of jealousy. It is superfluous to state in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe definition that the specified relation to each thing must not be\n\t\t\t\t\taccidental; no science whether theoretical or productive makes this\n\t\t\t\t\taddition to the definition either in discourse or in practice, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthis addition is aimed against the logical quibbling of the sciences.\n\t\t\t\t\t Let us then accept\n\t\t\t\t\tthese simple definitions, and let us make them more precise when we\n\t\t\t\t\tare speaking about the opposite dispositions. But these modes of emotion\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves are divided into species designated according to their\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference in respect of time or intensity or in regard to one of the\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects that cause the emotions.  I mean for instance that a man is called\n\t\t\t\t\tquick-tempered from feeling the emotion of anger sooner than he ought,\n\t\t\t\t\tharsh and passionate from feeling it more than he ought, bitter from\n\t\t\t\t\thaving a tendency to cherish his anger, violent and abusive owing to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe acts of retaliation to which his anger gives rise.  Men are called gourmands or\n\t\t\t\t\tgluttons and drunkards from having an irrational liability to\n\t\t\t\t\tindulgence in one or the other sort of nutriment.But it must not be ignored that some of the vices mentioned cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tbe classed under the heading of manner, if manner is taken to be\n\t\t\t\t\tfeeling the emotion to excess.For example, a man is not an adulterer because he\n\t\t\t\t\texceeds in intercourse with married women, for 'excess' does not apply\n\t\t\t\t\there, but adultery merely in itself is a vice, since the term denoting\n\t\t\t\t\tthe passion implicitly denotes that the man is vicious;  and similarly with outrage. Hence men dispute the\n\t\t\t\t\tcharge, and admit intercourse but deny adultery on the ground of\n\t\t\t\t\thaving acted in ignorance or under compulsion, or admit striking a\n\t\t\t\t\tblow but deny committing an outrage; and similarly in meeting the\n\t\t\t\t\tother charges of the same kind.These points having been\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken, we must next say that since the spirit has two parts, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtues are divided between them, one set being those of the rational\n\t\t\t\t\tpart, intellectual virtues, whose work is truth, whether about the\n\t\t\t\t\tnature of a thing or about its mode of production, while the other set\n\t\t\t\t\tbelongs to the part that is irrational but possesses appetition\n\t\t\t\t\t (for if the spirit\n\t\t\t\t\tis divided into parts, not any and every part possesses appetition),\n\t\t\t\t\tit therefore follows that the moral character is vicious or virtuous\n\t\t\t\t\tby reason of pursuing or avoiding certain pleasures and pains. This is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear from the classification of the emotions, faculties and states of\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter. For the faculties and the states are concerned with the\n\t\t\t\t\tmodes of emotion, and the emotions are distinguished by pain and\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure;  so that it\n\t\t\t\t\tfollows from these considerations as well as from the positions\n\t\t\t\t\talready laid down that all moral goodness is concerned with pleasures\n\t\t\t\t\tand pains.  For our state\n\t\t\t\t\tof character is related to and concerned with such things as have the\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty of making every person's spirit worse and better. But we say that men are wicked owing to pleasures and\n\t\t\t\t\tpains, through pursuing and avoiding the wrong ones or in the wrong\n\t\t\t\t\tway. Hence all men readily define the virtues as insensitiveness or\n\t\t\t\t\ttranquillity in regard to pleasures and pains, and the vices by the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite qualities.But since it has been\n\t\t\t\t\tassumed that goodness is a state of character of a sort that causes\n\t\t\t\t\tmen to be capable of doing the best actions and gives them the best\n\t\t\t\t\tdisposition in regard to the greatest good, and the best and greatest\n\t\t\t\t\tgood is that which is in accordance with right principle, and this is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe mean between excess and deficiency relative to ourselves, it would\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily follow that moral goodness corresponds with each\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular middle state and is concerned with certain mean points in\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasures and pains and pleasant and painful things.  And this middle state will\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes be in pleasures (for even in these there is excess and\n\t\t\t\t\tdeficiency), sometimes in pains, sometimes in both. For he that\n\t\t\t\t\texceeds in feeling delight exceeds in the pleasant, and he that\n\t\t\t\t\texceeds in feeling pain exceeds in the oppositeand this\n\t\t\t\t\twhether his feelings are excessive absolutely or excessive in relation\n\t\t\t\t\tto some standard, for instance are felt more than ordinary men feel\n\t\t\t\t\tthem; whereas the good man feels in the proper\n\t\t\t\t\tway. And\n\t\t\t\t\tsince there is a certain state of character which results in its\n\t\t\t\t\tpossessor's being in one instance such as to accept an excess and in\n\t\t\t\t\tanother such as to accept a deficiency of the same thing,it follows that as these actions\n\t\t\t\t\tare contrary to each other and to the mean, so also the states of\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter that cause them are contrary to each other and to\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue.It comes about, however, that sometimes all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe oppositions are more evident, sometimes those on the side of\n\t\t\t\t\texcess, in some cases those on the side of deficiency.  The cause of this contrariety\n\t\t\t\t\tis that the resemblance does not always reach the same point of\n\t\t\t\t\tinequality in regard to the middle, but sometimes it may pass over\n\t\t\t\t\tmore quickly from the excess, sometimes from the deficiency, to the\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle state, the person farther removed from which seems to be more\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary: for instance, with regard to the body excess is more healthy\n\t\t\t\t\tand nearer the middle than deficiency in the case of exercises but\n\t\t\t\t\tdeficiency than excess in the case of food.  Consequently the states of\n\t\t\t\t\twill favorable to athletic training will be variously favorable to\n\t\t\t\t\thealth according to the two different fields of choicein\n\t\t\t\t\tthe one case the over-energetic men <will be\n\t\t\t\t\tnearer the mean than the slack ones>, in the other the too hardy <will be nearer the mean than the\n\t\t\t\t\tself-indulgent ones>; and also the character contrary to the\n\t\t\t\t\tmoderate and rational will be in the one case the slack and not both\n\t\t\t\t\tthe slack and the over-energetic, and in the other case the\n\t\t\t\t\tself-indulgent and not the man who goes hungry.  And this comes about because\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the start our nature does not diverge from the mean in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tway as regards everything, but in energy we are deficient and in\n\t\t\t\t\tself-indulgence excessive, and this is also the same with regard the\n\t\t\t\t\tspirit.  And we class as\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to the mean the disposition to which we, and most men, are\n\t\t\t\t\tmore liable to err; whereas the other passes unnoticed as if\n\t\t\t\t\tnon-existent, because its rarity makes it not observed.  For instance we count anger\n\t\t\t\t\tthe contrary of gentleness and the passionate man the contrary of the\n\t\t\t\t\tgentle; yet there is also excess in the direction of\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing gentle and placable and not being angry when struck, but men of\n\t\t\t\t\tthat sort are few, and everyone is more prone to the other extreme; on\n\t\t\t\t\twhich account moreover a passionate temper is not a characteristic of\n\t\t\t\t\ta toady.And since we have dealt with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe scheme of states of character in respect of the various emotions\n\t\t\t\t\tin which there are excesses and deficiencies, and of the opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tstates in accordance with which men are disposed in accordance with\n\t\t\t\t\tright principle (though the question what is the right principle and\n\t\t\t\t\twhat rule is to guide us in defining the mean must be considered\n\t\t\t\t\tlater), it is evident that all the forms of moral goodness and\n\t\t\t\t\tbadness have to do with excesses and deficiencies of pleasures and\n\t\t\t\t\tpains, and that pleasures and pains result from the states of\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter and modes of emotion mentioned.  But then the best state in relation to each\n\t\t\t\t\tclass of thing is the middle state. It is clear, therefore, that the\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtues will be either all or some of these middle states.Let us, therefore, take another starting-point for the ensuing\n\t\t\t\t\tinquiry. Now\n\t\t\t\t\tall essences are by nature first principles of a certain kind, owing\n\t\t\t\t\tto which each is able to generate many things of the same sort as\n\t\t\t\t\titself, for example a man engenders men, and in general an animal\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals, and a plant plants.  And in addition to this, obviously man alone among\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals initiates certain conductfor we should not ascribe conduct to any of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe others.  And the first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples of that sort, which are the first source of motions, are\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled first principles in the strict sense, and most rightly those\n\t\t\t\t\tthat have necessary results; doubtless God is a ruling principle that\n\t\t\t\t\tacts in this way.  But the\n\t\t\t\t\tstrict sense of 'first principle' is not found in first principles\n\t\t\t\t\tincapable of movement, for example those of mathematics, although the\n\t\t\t\t\tterm is indeed used of them by analogy, for in mathematics if the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst principle were changed virtually all the things proved from it\n\t\t\t\t\twould change, though they do not change owing to themselves, one being\n\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed by the other, except by destroying the assumption and\n\t\t\t\t\tthereby establishing a proof. But man is a first principle of a certain\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion, for action is motion. And since as in other matters the first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple is a cause of the things that exist or come into existence\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause of it, we must think as we do in the case of demonstrations.\n\t\t\t\t\t For example, if as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe angles of a triangle are together equal to two right angles the\n\t\t\t\t\tangles of a quadrilateral are necessarily equal to four right angles,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles is clearly\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cause of that fact; and supposing a triangle were to change, a\n\t\t\t\t\tquadrilateral would necessarily change toofor example if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe angles of a triangle became equal to three right angles, the\n\t\t\t\t\tangles of a quadrilateral would become equal to six right angles, or\n\t\t\t\t\tif four, eight; also if a triangle does not change but is as\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribed, a quadrilateral too must of necessity be as\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribed.The necessity of what we are arguing is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear from ; at present we cannot either deny or affirm anything\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinitely except just this. Supposing there were no further cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe triangle's having the property stated, then the triangle would be\n\t\t\t\t\ta sort of first principle or cause of the later stages.  Hence if in fact there are\n\t\t\t\t\tamong existing things some that admit of the opposite state, their\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst principles also must necessarily have the same quality;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor of things that are of necessity the\n\t\t\t\t\tresult is necessary, albeit the subsequent stages may possibly happen\n\t\t\t\t\tin the opposite way. And the things that depend on men themselves in\n\t\t\t\t\tmany cases belong to this class of variables, and men are themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first principle of things of this sort.  Hence it is clear that all the\n\t\t\t\t\tactions of which a man is the first principle and controller may\n\t\t\t\t\teither happen or not happen, and that it depends on himself for them\n\t\t\t\t\tto happen or not, as he controls their existence or non-existence. But\n\t\t\t\t\tof things which it depends on him to do or not to do he is himself the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause, and what he is the cause of depends on himself.  And since goodness and\n\t\t\t\t\tbadness and the actions that spring from them are in some cases\n\t\t\t\t\tpraiseworthy and in other cases blameworthy (for praise and blame are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot given to things that we possess from necessity or fortune or\n\t\t\t\t\tnature but to things of which we ourselves are the cause, since for\n\t\t\t\t\tthings of which another person is the cause, that person has the blame\n\t\t\t\t\tand the praise), it is clear that both goodness and badness have to do\n\t\t\t\t\twith things where a man is himself the cause and origin of his\n\t\t\t\t\tactions.  We must, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tascertain what is the kind of actions of which a man is himself the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause and origin. Now we all agree that each man is the cause of all\n\t\t\t\t\tthose acts that are voluntary and purposive for him individually, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he is not himself the cause of those that are involuntary. And\n\t\t\t\t\tclearly he commits voluntarily all the acts that he commits purposely.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is clear, then,that both\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness and badness will be in the class of things\n\t\t\t\t\tvoluntary.We must, therefore, ascertain what voluntary\n\t\t\t\t\tand involuntary mean, and what is purposive choice, since they enter\n\t\t\t\t\tinto the definition of goodness and badness. And first we must\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider the meaning of voluntary and involuntary.  Now they would seem to refer\n\t\t\t\t\tto one of three thingsconformity with appetition, or with\n\t\t\t\t\tpurposive choice, or with thought: voluntary is what conforms with one\n\t\t\t\t\tof these and involuntary is what contravenes one of them.  But moreover there are three\n\t\t\t\t\tsubdivisions of appetitionwish, passion and desire; so that\n\t\t\t\t\twe have to distinguish these. And first we must consider conformity\n\t\t\t\t\twith desire.It would seem that everything that conforms\n\t\t\t\t\twith desire is voluntary. For everything involuntary seems to be\n\t\t\t\t\tforced, and what is forced and everything that people do or suffer\n\t\t\t\t\tunder necessity is painful, as indeed Evenus says:\n\t\t\t\t\t Evenus of  = Theog. 472\n\t\t\t\t\t so that if a thing is painful\n\t\t\t\t\tit is forced and if a thing is forced it is painful; but everything\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to desire is painful (for desire is for what is pleasant), so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is forced and involuntary. Therefore what conforms with desire\n\t\t\t\t\tis voluntary, for things contrary to and things in conformity with\n\t\t\t\t\tdesire are opposite to one another.  Again, all wickedness makes a man more unrighteous,\n\t\t\t\t\tand lack of self-control seems to be wickedness; and the uncontrolled\n\t\t\t\t\tman is the sort of man to act in conformity with desire contrary to\n\t\t\t\t\tcalculation, and he shows his lack of control when his conduct is\n\t\t\t\t\tguided by desire; so that the uncontrolled man will\n\t\t\t\t\tact unrighteously by acting in conformity with desire. But unrighteous\n\t\t\t\t\taction is voluntary. Therefore he will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe acting voluntarily, and action guided by desire is voluntary.\n\t\t\t\t\tIndeed it would be strange if those who become uncontrolled will be\n\t\t\t\t\tmore righteous. From these considerations, then, it would appear that\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is in conformity with desire is voluntary; and from this the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite follows, for all that a\n\t\t\t\t\tman does voluntarily he wishes to do, and what he wishes to do he does\n\t\t\t\t\tvoluntarily, but nobody wishes what he thinks to be bad. But yet the\n\t\t\t\t\tuncontrolled man does not do what he wishes, for being uncontrolled\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans acting against what one thinks to be best owing to desire; hence\n\t\t\t\t\tit will come about that the same person is acting voluntarily and\n\t\t\t\t\tinvoluntarily at the same time.  But this is impossible. And further, the\n\t\t\t\t\tself-controlled man will act righteously, or more righteously than\n\t\t\t\t\tlack of control will; for self-control is goodness, and goodness makes\n\t\t\t\t\tmen more righteous. And a man exercises self-control when he acts\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst his desire in conformity with rational calculation. So that if\n\t\t\t\t\trighteous action is voluntary, as also unrighteous action (for both of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese seem to be voluntary, and if one of them is voluntary it follows\n\t\t\t\t\tof necessity that the other is also), whereas what is contrary to\n\t\t\t\t\tdesire is involuntary, it therefore follows that the same person will\n\t\t\t\t\tdo the same action voluntarily and involuntarily at the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime.The same argument applies also in the case\n\t\t\t\t\tof passion;for there appear\n\t\t\t\t\tto be control and lack of control of passion as well as of desire and\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is contrary to passion is painful and restraint is a matter of\n\t\t\t\t\tforce, so that if what is forced is involuntary, what is in accordance\n\t\t\t\t\twith passion will always be voluntary. Even Heracleitus seems to have\n\t\t\t\t\tin view the strength of passion when he remarks that the checking of\n\t\t\t\t\tpassion is painful; for 'It is difficult (he says) to do battle with\n\t\t\t\t\tpassion, for it buys its wish at the price of life.'  And if it is impossible to do\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same act voluntarily and involuntarily at the same time and in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect of the same part of the act, action guided by one's wish is\n\t\t\t\t\tmore voluntary than action guided by desire or passion. And a proof of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is that we do many things voluntarily without anger or\n\t\t\t\t\tdesire.It remains, therefore, to consider whether\n\t\t\t\t\tacting as we wish and acting voluntarily are the same. This also seems\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible. For it is a fundamental assumption with us, and a general\n\t\t\t\t\topinion, that wickedness makes men more unrighteous; and lack of\n\t\t\t\t\tself-control seems to be a sort of wickedness. But from the hypothesis\n\t\t\t\t\tthat acting as we wish and acting voluntarily are the same the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite will result; for nobody wishes things that he thinks to be\n\t\t\t\t\tbad, yet he does them when he has become uncontrolled, so if to do\n\t\t\t\t\tinjustice is voluntary and the voluntary is what is in accordance with\n\t\t\t\t\tone's wish, then when a man has become uncontrolled he will no longer\n\t\t\t\t\tbe acting unjustly but will be more just than he was before he lost\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrol of himself. But this is impossible. Therefore it is clear that\n\t\t\t\t\tacting voluntarily does not mean acting in accordance with appetition\n\t\t\t\t\tnor acting involuntarily acting in opposition to appetition.Also it is clear from the following considerations that voluntary\n\t\t\t\t\taction does not mean acting in accordance with purposive choice. It\n\t\t\t\t\twas proved that\n\t\t\t\t\tacting in accordance with one's wish is not acting involuntarily,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut rather everything that one wishes is also\n\t\t\t\t\tvoluntaryit has only been proved that it is possible to do\n\t\t\t\t\ta thing voluntarily without wishing; but many things that we wish we\n\t\t\t\t\tdo suddenly, whereas nobody makes a purposive choice\n\t\t\t\t\tsuddenly.But if as we said the voluntary must necessarily be one of\n\t\t\t\t\tthree thingswhat is in conformity with appetition, or with\n\t\t\t\t\tpurposive choice, or with thought, and if it is not the two\n\t\t\t\t\tformer, it remains that voluntariness consists in acting with some\n\t\t\t\t\tkind of thought. \n\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, let us put a conclusion to our delimitation of the voluntary\n\t\t\t\t\tand involuntary by carrying the thought argument a little further.\n\t\t\t\t\tActing under compulsion and not under compulsion seem to be terms akin\n\t\t\t\t\tto the ones mentioned; for we say that everything forced is\n\t\t\t\t\tinvoluntary and everything involuntary is forced. So we must first\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider the exact meaning of 'forced,' and how what is forced is\n\t\t\t\t\trelated to the voluntary and involuntary.  It seems, then, that in the sphere of conduct\n\t\t\t\t\t'forced' or 'necessary,' and force or necessity, are the opposite of\n\t\t\t\t\t'voluntary,' and of persuasion. And we employ the terms force and\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity in a general sense even in the case of inanimate objects: we\n\t\t\t\t\tsay that a stone travels upwards and fire downwards by force and under\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity, whereas when they travel according to their natural and\n\t\t\t\t\tintrinsic impulse we say that they do not move under\n\t\t\t\t\tforcealthough nevertheless they are not spoken of as moving\n\t\t\t\t\tvoluntarily:the state\n\t\t\t\t\topposite to forced motion has no name, but when they travel contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tto their natural impulse we say that they move by force.  Similarly also in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tliving things and of animals, we see many being acted on by force, and\n\t\t\t\t\talso acting under force when something moves them from outside,\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to the impulse within the thing itself. In inanimate things\n\t\t\t\t\tthe moving principle is simple, but in living things it is multiple,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor appetition and rational principle are not always in harmony.\n\t\t\t\t\t Hence whereas in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case of the other animals the factor of force is simple, as it is\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of inanimate objects, for animals do not possess rational\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple and appetition in opposition to it, but live by their\n\t\t\t\t\tappetition, in man both forms of force are presentthat is,\n\t\t\t\t\tat a certain age, the age to which we attribute action in the proper\n\t\t\t\t\tsense; for we do not speak of a child as acting, any more than a wild\n\t\t\t\t\tanimal, but only a person who has attained to acting by rational\n\t\t\t\t\tcalculation.  So what is\n\t\t\t\t\tforced always seems to be painful, and no one acting under force acts\n\t\t\t\t\tgladly. Consequently there is a great deal of dispute about the\n\t\t\t\t\tself-controlled man and the uncontrolled. For each of them acts under\n\t\t\t\t\ta conflict of impulses within him, so that the self-controlled man,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey say, acts under force in dragging himself away from the pleasures\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he covets (for he feels pain in dragging himself away against the\n\t\t\t\t\tresistance of appetition), while the uncontrolled man acts under force\n\t\t\t\t\tin going contrary to his rational faculty.  But he seems to feel less pain, because desire\n\t\t\t\t\tis for what is pleasant, and he follows his desire; so that the\n\t\t\t\t\tuncontrolled man rather acts voluntarily and not under force, because\n\t\t\t\t\tnot painfully. On the other hand persuasion is thought to be the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite of force and necessity; and the self-controlled man is led\n\t\t\t\t\ttowards things that he has been persuaded to pursue, and proceeds not\n\t\t\t\t\tunder force but voluntarily; whereas desire leads\n\t\t\t\t\ta man on without employing persuasion, since it possesses no element\n\t\t\t\t\tof rational principle.  It\n\t\t\t\t\thas, then, been stated that these men only seem to act under force and\n\t\t\t\t\tinvoluntarily; and we have shown the reasonit is because\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir action has a certain resemblance to forced action, just as we\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak of forced action even in the case of inanimate objects too.\n\t\t\t\t\t Yet nevertheless\n\t\t\t\t\tif one added there also the addition made in our definition, the\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement is refuted. For we speak of a thing as being forced to act\n\t\t\t\t\twhen something external moves it or brings it to rest, acting against\n\t\t\t\t\tthe impulse within the thing itselfwhen there is no\n\t\t\t\t\texternal motive, we do not say that it acts under force; and in the\n\t\t\t\t\tuncontrolled man and the self-controlled it is the impulse present in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe man himself that drives him (for he has both impulses), so that as\n\t\t\t\t\tfar as these considerations go neither of them would be acting under\n\t\t\t\t\tforce, but voluntarily; \n\t\t\t\t\tnor yet are they acting of necessity, for by necessity we mean an\n\t\t\t\t\texternal principle that either checks or moves a man in opposition to\n\t\t\t\t\this impulseas if A were to take hold of B's hand and with\n\t\t\t\t\tit strike C, B's will and desire both resisting; whereas when the\n\t\t\t\t\tsource of action is from within, we do not speak of the act as done\n\t\t\t\t\tunder force.  Again, both\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure and pain are present in both cases; for a man exercising\n\t\t\t\t\tself-control both feels pain when he finally acts in opposition to his\n\t\t\t\t\tdesire and enjoys the pleasure of hoping that he will be benefited\n\t\t\t\t\tlater on, or is even being benefited already, by being in good\n\t\t\t\t\thealth;and the\n\t\t\t\t\tuncontrolled man enjoys getting what he desires owing to his lack of\n\t\t\t\t\tself-control, but feels prospective pain because he thinks he is doing\n\t\t\t\t\ta bad thing.  Hence it is\n\t\t\t\t\treasonable to say that each does what he does under compulsion, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat each is at one point acting involuntarily, from motives both of\n\t\t\t\t\tappetition and of rational calculationfor calculation and\n\t\t\t\t\tappetition are things quite separate, and each is pushed aside by the\n\t\t\t\t\tother. Hence men transfer this to the spirit as a whole, because they\n\t\t\t\t\tsee something of this sort in the experiences of the spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t Now it is\n\t\t\t\t\tadmissible to say this in the case of the parts, but the spirit as a\n\t\t\t\t\twhole both in the uncontrolled and in the self-controlled man acts\n\t\t\t\t\tvoluntarily, and in neither case does the man act under compulsion,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut one of the parts in them so actsfor we possess by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature both parts; since rational principle is a natural property,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause it will be present in us if our growth is allowed and not\n\t\t\t\t\tstunted, and also desire is natural, because it accompanies and is\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent in us from birth;  and these are pretty nearly the two things by which we define the\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturalit is what accompanies everybody as soon as he is\n\t\t\t\t\tborn, or else what comes to us if development is allowed to go on\n\t\t\t\t\tregularly, for example grey hair, old age, etc. Therefore each of the\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo persons in a way acts not in accordance with nature, but\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely each does act according to nature, though not according to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same nature.  The\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties, then, raised about the uncontrolled and the\n\t\t\t\t\tself-controlled man are these: do both, or does one of them, act under\n\t\t\t\t\tcompulsion, so that they either act not voluntarily or else\n\t\t\t\t\tvoluntarily and under compulsion at the same timeand if\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is done under compulsion is involuntary, act voluntarily and\n\t\t\t\t\tinvoluntarily at the same time? And it is fairly clear from what has\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen said how these difficulties are to be met. But there is another way in which people are\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid to act under compulsion and of necessity without disagreement\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween rational principle and appetition, when they do something that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey consider actually painful and bad but they are faced by flogging\n\t\t\t\t\tor imprisonment or execution if they do not do it; for in these cases\n\t\t\t\t\tthey say that they are acting under necessity.  Possibly, however, this is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot the case, but they all do the actual deeds willingly, since it is\n\t\t\t\t\topen to them not to do them but to endure the penalty threatened.\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, perhaps\n\t\t\t\t\tsomeone might say that in some cases these actions are done of\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity and in others not. For in cases where the presence or\n\t\t\t\t\tabsence of such circumstances depends on the agent himself, even the\n\t\t\t\t\tactions that he does without wishing to do them he does willingly and\n\t\t\t\t\tnot under compulsion; but where in such cases the circumstances do not\n\t\t\t\t\trest with himself, he acts under compulsion in a sense, though not\n\t\t\t\t\tindeed under compulsion absolutely, because he does not definitely\n\t\t\t\t\tchoose the actual thing that he does but the object for which he does\n\t\t\t\t\tit; since even in the objects of action there is a certain difference.\n\t\t\t\t\t For if someone\n\t\t\t\t\twere to kill a man to prevent his catching him by groping for\n\t\t\t\t\thim, it\n\t\t\t\t\twould be ridiculous for him to say that he had done it under\n\t\t\t\t\tcompulsion and of necessitythere must be some greater and\n\t\t\t\t\tmore painful evil that he will suffer if he does not do it. It is when\n\t\t\t\t\ta man does something evil for the sake of something good, or for\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliverance from another evil, that he will be acting under necessity\n\t\t\t\t\tand by compulsion, or at all events not by nature; and then he will\n\t\t\t\t\treally be acting unwillingly, for these actions do not rest with\n\t\t\t\t\thimself. On this account many reckon\n\t\t\t\t\teven love as involuntary, and some forms of anger, and natural\n\t\t\t\t\timpulses, because their power is even beyond nature; and we pardon\n\t\t\t\t\tthem as naturally capable of constraining nature. And it would be\n\t\t\t\t\tthought that a man is acting more under compulsion and involuntarily\n\t\t\t\t\twhen his object is to avoid violent pain than when it is to avoid mild\n\t\t\t\t\tpain, and in general more when his object is the avoidance of pain\n\t\t\t\t\tthan when it is to gain enjoyment. For what rests with\n\t\t\t\t\thimselfand it wholly turns on thismeans what his\n\t\t\t\t\tnature is able to bear; what his nature is not able to bear and what\n\t\t\t\t\tis not a matter of his own natural appetition or calculation does not\n\t\t\t\t\trest with himself.  On\n\t\t\t\t\tthis account also in the case of persons who are inspired and utter\n\t\t\t\t\tprophecies, although they perform an act of thought, nevertheless we\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not say that saying what they said and doing what they did rested\n\t\t\t\t\twith themselves.  Nor yet\n\t\t\t\t\tdo we say that what men do because of desire rests with themselves; so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat some thoughts and emotions, or the actions that are guided by\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch thoughts and calculations, do not rest with ourselves, but it is\n\t\t\t\t\tas Philolaus\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid'some arguments are too strong for us.' Hence if it was\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary to consider the voluntary and involuntary with reference\n\t\t\t\t\talso to acting under compulsion, let this be our decision of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter (for those who cause most hindrance . . . the voluntary . .\n\t\t\t\t\t. as acting under\n\t\t\t\t\tcompulsion, but voluntarily).Now that this is\n\t\t\t\t\tconcluded, and as the voluntary has been found not to be defined by\n\t\t\t\t\tappetition, nor yet by purposive choice, it therefore remains to\n\t\t\t\t\tdefine it as that which is in accordance with thought.  Now the\n\t\t\t\t\tvoluntary seems to be the opposite of the involuntary; and acting with\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge of either the person acted on or the instrument or the\n\t\t\t\t\tresult (for sometimes the agent knows that it is his father but does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot intend to kill him but to save himas the Peliads didor knows that what he is\n\t\t\t\t\toffering is a drink but offers it as a love-charm or wine, when really\n\t\t\t\t\tit is hemlock) seems to be the opposite of acting without knowing the\n\t\t\t\t\tperson acted on, the instrument and the nature of the act, through\n\t\t\t\t\tignorance and not by accident. But to act through ignorance of the\n\t\t\t\t\tact, the means and the person acted on is involuntary action.\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite is voluntary. It follows then that all the things that a man\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not in ignorance, and through his own agency, when it is in his\n\t\t\t\t\tpower not to do them, are voluntary acts, and it is in this that the\n\t\t\t\t\tvoluntary consists; and all the things that he does in ignorance, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough being in ignorance, he does involuntarily.  But since to understand or\n\t\t\t\t\tknow has two meanings, one being to have the knowledge and the other\n\t\t\t\t\tto use it, a man who has knowledge but is not using it would in one\n\t\t\t\t\tcase be justly described as acting in ignorance but in another case\n\t\t\t\t\tunjustly namely, if his non-employment of the knowledge\n\t\t\t\t\twere due to carelessness. And similarly one would be blamed for not\n\t\t\t\t\thaving the knowledge, if it were something that was easy or necessary\n\t\t\t\t\tand his not having it is due to carelessness or pleasure or pain.\n\t\t\t\t\tThese points therefore must be added to our definition. Let this,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, be our mode of definition about the voluntary and involuntary.Next let us speak about purposive choice, first raising various difficulties about it.For one might doubt to which\n\t\t\t\t\tclass it naturally belongs and in what class it ought to be put, and\n\t\t\t\t\twhether the voluntary and the purposely chosen are different things or\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same thing.  And a\n\t\t\t\t\tview specially put forward from some quarters, which on inquiry may\n\t\t\t\t\tseem correct, is that purposive choice is one of two things, either\n\t\t\t\t\topinion or appetition; for both are seen to accompany it.  Now it is evident that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot appetition; for in that case it would be either wish or desire or\n\t\t\t\t\tpassion, since nobody wants to get a thing without having experienced\n\t\t\t\t\tone of those feelings. Now even animals possess passion and desire,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut they do not have purposive choice. And again, beings that possess\n\t\t\t\t\tboth of these often make choices even without passion and desire; and\n\t\t\t\t\twhile they are experiencing these feelings do not make a choice but\n\t\t\t\t\thold out. Again, desire and passion are always accompanied by pain,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut we often make a choice even without pain.  But moreover purposive choice\n\t\t\t\t\tis not the same as wish either; for men wish for some things that they\n\t\t\t\t\tknow to be impossible, for instance to be king of all mankind and to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe immortal, but nobody purposively chooses a thing knowing it to be\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible, nor in general a thing that, though possible, he does not\n\t\t\t\t\tthink in his own power to do or not to do. So that this much is\n\t\t\t\t\tcleara thing purposively chosen must necessarily be\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething that rests with oneself.  And similarly it is manifest\n\t\t\t\t\tthat purposive choice is not opinion either, nor something that one\n\t\t\t\t\tsimply thinks; for we saw that a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing chosen is something in one's own power, but we have opinions as\n\t\t\t\t\tto many things that do not depend on us, for instance that the\n\t\t\t\t\tdiagonal of a square is incommensurable with the side;  and again, choice is not true\n\t\t\t\t\tor false. Nor yet is purposive choice an opinion about practicable\n\t\t\t\t\tthings within one's own power that makes us think that we ought to do\n\t\t\t\t\tor not to do something; but this characteristic is common to opinion\n\t\t\t\t\tand to wish.  For no one\n\t\t\t\t\tpurposively chooses any End, but the means to his EndI mean\n\t\t\t\t\tfor instance no one chooses to be healthy, but to take a walk or sit\n\t\t\t\t\tdown for the sake of being healthy, no one chooses to be well off, but\n\t\t\t\t\tto go into business or to speculate for the sake of being well off;\n\t\t\t\t\tand generally, one who makes a choice always makes it clear both what\n\t\t\t\t\this choice is and what its object is, 'object' meaning that for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsake of which he chooses something else and 'choice' meaning that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich he chooses for the sake of something else.  Whereas clearly it is\n\t\t\t\t\tspecially an End that a man wishes, and the feeling that he ought to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe healthy and prosperous is an opinion. So these considerations make\n\t\t\t\t\tit clear that purposive choice is different from both opinion and\n\t\t\t\t\twish. Forming wishes and forming opinions apply specially to one's\n\t\t\t\t\tEnd; purposive choice is not of Ends.It is clear,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, that purposive choice is not either wish or opinion or judgement\n\t\t\t\t\tsimply; but in what does it differ from them? and how is it related to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe voluntary?To answer\n\t\t\t\t\tthese questions will make it clear what purposive choice is.\n\t\t\t\t\t Now of things\n\t\t\t\t\tthat can both be and not be, some are such that it is possible to\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberate about them, but about others it is not possible. Some\n\t\t\t\t\tthings can either be or not be but their coming into being does not\n\t\t\t\t\trest with us, but in some cases is due to the operation of nature and\n\t\t\t\t\tin others to other causes; and about these things nobody would\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberate unless in ignorance of the facts.  But with some things not\n\t\t\t\t\tonly their existence or non-existence is possible, but also for human\n\t\t\t\t\tbeings to deliberate about them; and these are all the things that it\n\t\t\t\t\trests with us to do or not to do. Hence we do not deliberate about\n\t\t\t\t\taffairs in , or about\n\t\t\t\t\thow to square the circle; for affairs in  do not rest with us, whereas the objects of\n\t\t\t\t\tchoice and things practicable are among things resting with us, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsquaring the circle is entirely impracticable (and thus it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tthat purposive choice is not simply opinion either).  But purposive choice does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot deal with all the practicable things resting with us either.\n\t\t\t\t\t Hence one might\n\t\t\t\t\talso raise the question, why is it exactly that, whereas doctors\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberate about things in their field of science, scholars do not?\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reason is that since error occurs in two ways (for we err either\n\t\t\t\t\tin reasoning, or in perception when actually doing the thing), in\n\t\t\t\t\tmedicine it is possible to err in both ways, but in grammar error only\n\t\t\t\t\toccurs in our perception and action, to\n\t\t\t\t\tinvestigate which would be an endless undertaking.Since then purposive choice is not either opinion nor wish\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately, nor yet both (for no one makes a deliberate choice\n\t\t\t\t\tsuddenly, but men do suddenly think they ought to act and wish to\n\t\t\t\t\tact), therefore it arises as from both, for both of them are present\n\t\t\t\t\twith a person choosing. \n\t\t\t\t\tBut how purposive choice arises out of opinion and wish must be\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidered. And indeed in a manner the actual term 'choice' makes this\n\t\t\t\t\tclear. 'Choice' is 'taking,' but not taking simplyit is\n\t\t\t\t\ttaking one thing in preference to another; but this cannot be done\n\t\t\t\t\twithout consideration and deliberation; hence purposive choice arises\n\t\t\t\t\tout of deliberative opinion.Now nobody deliberates\n\t\t\t\t\tabout his Endthis everybody has fixed; but men deliberate\n\t\t\t\t\tabout the means leading to their Enddoes this contribute to\n\t\t\t\t\tit, or does this ? or when a means has been decided on, how will that\n\t\t\t\t\tbe procured? and this deliberation as to means we all pursue until we\n\t\t\t\t\thave carried the starting-point in the process of producing the End\n\t\t\t\t\tback to ourselves.  If,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, nobody chooses without first preparing, and deliberating as to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe comparative merits of the alternatives, and a man deliberates as\n\t\t\t\t\tto those among the means to the End capable of existing or not\n\t\t\t\t\texisting that are within our power, it is clear that purposive choice\n\t\t\t\t\tis deliberative appetition of things within one's power. For we\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberate about everything that we choose, although of course we do\n\t\t\t\t\tnot choose everything that we deliberate about. I call appetition\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberative when its origin or cause is deliberation,and when a man desires because\n\t\t\t\t\tof having deliberated. \n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore the faculty of purposive choice is not present in the other\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals, nor in man at every age nor in every condition, for no more\n\t\t\t\t\tis the act of deliberation, nor yet the concept of cause: it is quite\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible that many men may possess the faculty of forming an opinion\n\t\t\t\t\twhether to do or not to do a thing without also having the power of\n\t\t\t\t\tforming this opinion by process of reasoning.  For the deliberative faculty\n\t\t\t\t\tis the spirit's power of contemplating a kind of causefor\n\t\t\t\t\tone sort of cause is the final cause, as although cause means anything\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause of which a thing comes about, it is the object of a thing's\n\t\t\t\t\texistence or production that we specially designate as its cause: for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance, if a man walks in order to fetch things, fetching things is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cause of his walking. Consequently people who have no fixed aim\n\t\t\t\t\tare not given to deliberation.  Hence inasmuch as if a man of his own accord and not\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough ignorance does or refrains from doing something resting with\n\t\t\t\t\thimself either to do or not to do, he acts or refrains from acting\n\t\t\t\t\tvoluntarily, but yet we do many such things without deliberation or\n\t\t\t\t\tprevious thought, it necessarily follows that, although all that has\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen purposively chosen is voluntary, 'voluntary' is not the same as\n\t\t\t\t\t'chosen,' and, although all things done by purposive choice are\n\t\t\t\t\tvoluntary, not all things voluntary are done by purposive choice.\n\t\t\t\t\t And at the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime it is clear from these considerations that the classification of\n\t\t\t\t\toffences made by legislators as in voluntary, voluntary and\n\t\t\t\t\tpremeditated is a good one; for even if it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot precisely accurate, yet at all events it approximates to the truth\n\t\t\t\t\tin a way.  But we will\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak about this in our examination of justice. As to purposive\n\t\t\t\t\tchoice, it is clear that it is not absolutely identical with wish nor\n\t\t\t\t\twith opinion, but is opinion plus appetition when these follow as a\n\t\t\t\t\tconclusion from deliberation.But since\n\t\t\t\t\tone who deliberates always deliberates for the sake of some object,\n\t\t\t\t\tand a man deliberating always has some aim in view with reference to\n\t\t\t\t\twhich he considers what is expedient, nobody deliberates about his\n\t\t\t\t\tEnd, but this is a starting-point or assumption,  like the postulates in the\n\t\t\t\t\ttheoretic sciences (we have spoken about this briefly at the beginning\n\t\t\t\t\tof this discourse, and in detail in ); whereas with all men\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberation whether technical or untechnical is about the means that\n\t\t\t\t\tlead to their End, e.g. when they deliberate about whether to go to\n\t\t\t\t\twar or not to go to war with a given person.  And the question of means\n\t\t\t\t\twill depend rather on a prior question, that is, the question of\n\t\t\t\t\tobject, for instance wealth or pleasure or something else of that kind\n\t\t\t\t\twhich happens to be our object. For one who deliberates deliberates if\n\t\t\t\t\the has considered, from the standpoint of the End, either what tends\n\t\t\t\t\tto enable him to bring the End to himself or how he can himself go to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe End. And by nature the End is\n\t\t\t\t\talways a good and a thing about which men deliberate step by\n\t\t\t\t\tstep(for example a\n\t\t\t\t\tdoctor may deliberate whether he shall give a drug, and a general\n\t\t\t\t\twhere he shall pitch his camp) when their End is the good that is the\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolute best;  but in\n\t\t\t\t\tcontravention of nature and by perversion not the good but the\n\t\t\t\t\tapparent good is the End. The reason is that there are some things\n\t\t\t\t\tthat cannot be employed for something other than their natural\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects, for instance sightit is not possible to see a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing that is not visible, or to hear a thing that is not audible; but\n\t\t\t\t\ta science does enable us to do a thing that is not the object of the\n\t\t\t\t\tscience. For health and disease are not the objects of the same\n\t\t\t\t\tscience in the same way: health is its object in accordance with\n\t\t\t\t\tnature, and disease in contravention of nature.  And similarly, by nature\n\t\t\t\t\tgood is the object of wish, but evil is also its object in\n\t\t\t\t\tcontravention of nature; by nature one wishes good, against nature and\n\t\t\t\t\tby perversion one even wishes evil.But\n\t\t\t\t\tmoreover with everything its corruption and perversion are not in any\n\t\t\t\t\tchance direction, but leads to the contrary and intermediate states.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor it is not possible to go outside these, since even error does not\n\t\t\t\t\tlead to any chance thing, but, in the case of things that have\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries, to the contraries, and to those contraries that are\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary according to their science. It\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore necessarily follows that both error and purposive choice\n\t\t\t\t\ttake place from the middle point to the contraries (the contraries of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe middle being the more and the less).And the cause is\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure and pain; for things are so constituted that the pleasant\n\t\t\t\t\tappears to the spirit good and the more pleasant better, the painful\n\t\t\t\t\tbad and the more painful worse. So from these things also it\n\t\t\t\t\tis clear that goodness and badness have to do with pleasures and\n\t\t\t\t\tpains; for they occur in connection with the objects of purposive\n\t\t\t\t\tchoice, and this has to do with good and bad and what appears to be\n\t\t\t\t\tgood and bad, and pleasure and pain are by nature things of that\n\t\t\t\t\tkind.It therefore follows that since moral\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness is itself a middle state and is entirely concerned with\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasures and pains, and badness consists in excess and defect and is\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned with the same things as goodness, moral goodness or virtue\n\t\t\t\t\tis a state of purposively choosing the mean in relation to ourselves\n\t\t\t\t\tin all those pleasant and painful things in regard to which according\n\t\t\t\t\tas a person feels pleasure or pain he is described as having some\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular moral quality(for a person is not said to have a particular\n\t\t\t\t\tmoral character merely for being fond of sweets or\n\t\t\t\t\tsavories).These things having been\n\t\t\t\t\tsettled, let us say whether goodness makes the purposive choice\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrect and the End right in the sense of making the agent choose for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of the proper End, or whether (as some hold) it makes the\n\t\t\t\t\trational principle right. But what does this is\n\t\t\t\t\tself-controlfor that saves the rational principle from\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing corrupted; and goodness and self-control are different.\n\t\t\t\t\t But we must speak\n\t\t\t\t\tabout this later, since all who do hold that goodness makes the\n\t\t\t\t\trational principle right think so on the ground that that is the\n\t\t\t\t\tnature of self-control and self-control is a praiseworthy thing.\n\t\t\t\t\t Having raised this\n\t\t\t\t\tpreliminary question let us continue.It is possible to have one's aim right but\n\t\t\t\t\tto be entirely wrong in one's means to the end aimed at; and it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible for the aim to have been wrongly chosen but the means\n\t\t\t\t\tconducing to it to be right; and for neither to be right.  But does goodness decide the\n\t\t\t\t\taim or the means to it? Well, our\n\t\t\t\t\tposition is that it decides the aim, because this is not a matter of\n\t\t\t\t\tlogical inference or rational principle, but in fact this must be\n\t\t\t\t\tassumed as a starting-point. For a doctor does not consider whether\n\t\t\t\t\this patient ought to be healthy or not, but whether he ought to take\n\t\t\t\t\twalking exercise or not, and the gymnastic trainer does not consider\n\t\t\t\t\twhether his pupil ought to be in good condition or not, but whether he\n\t\t\t\t\tought to go in for wrestling or not;  and similarly no other science either\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberates about its End. For as in the theoretic sciences the\n\t\t\t\t\tassumptions are first principles, so in the productive sciences the\n\t\t\t\t\tEnd is a starting-point and assumption: since it is required that\n\t\t\t\t\tso-and-so is to be in good health, if that is to be secured it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary for such-and-such a thing to be providedjust as\n\t\t\t\t\tin mathematics, if the angles of a triangle are together equal to two\n\t\t\t\t\tright angles, such and such a consequence necessarily follows.\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore the End\n\t\t\t\t\tis the starting-point of the process of thought, but the conclusion of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe process of thought is the starting-point of action. If, then, of\n\t\t\t\t\tall rightness either rational principle or goodness is the cause, if\n\t\t\t\t\trational principle is not the cause of the rightness of the End, then\n\t\t\t\t\tthe End (though not the means to the End) will be right owing to\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness.  But the End is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe object for which one acts; for every purposive choice is a choice\n\t\t\t\t\tof something and for some object. The End is therefore the object for\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the thing chosen is the mean, of which End goodness is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause by its act of choicethough the choice is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot of the End but of the means adopted for the sake of the End.\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore though\n\t\t\t\t\tit belongs to another faculty to hit on the things that must be done\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the sake of the End, goodness is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of the End aimed at by choice being right.  And owing to this it is by a\n\t\t\t\t\tman's purposive choice that we judge his characterthat is,\n\t\t\t\t\tnot by what he does but what he does it for.  Similarly also badness\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses purposive choice to be made from the opposite motives. If\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, when a man has it in his power to do what is honorable and\n\t\t\t\t\trefrain from doing what is base, he does the opposite, it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tthat this man is not virtuous. Hence it necessarily follows that both\n\t\t\t\t\tbadness and goodness are voluntary; for there is no necessity to do\n\t\t\t\t\twicked things.  For this\n\t\t\t\t\treason badness is a blameworthy thing and goodness praiseworthy; for\n\t\t\t\t\tinvoluntary baseness and evil are not blamed nor involuntary good\n\t\t\t\t\tthings praised, but voluntary ones are. Moreover we praise and blame\n\t\t\t\t\tall men with regard to their purpose rather than with regard to their\n\t\t\t\t\tactions (although activity is a more desirable thing than goodness),\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause men may do bad acts under compulsion, but no one is compelled\n\t\t\t\t\tto choose to do them. \n\t\t\t\t\tMoreover because it is not easy to see the quality of a man's purpose\n\t\t\t\t\twe are forced to judge his character from his actions;  therefore activity is more\n\t\t\t\t\tdesirable, but purpose more praiseworthy. And this not only follows\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom our assumptions but also is admitted by reason of observed\n\t\t\t\t\tfacts."}}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "3", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n":

But let us take them separately and discuss them\n\t\t\t\t\tseriatim. And first let us speak about Courage.Now almost everybody holds that the brave man is concerned with\n\t\t\t\t\tfears, and that courage is one of the virtues. And in our\n\t\t\t\t\tschedule previously we distinguished\n\t\t\t\t\tdaring and fear as contraries, for they are indeed in a manner opposed\n\t\t\t\t\tto one another.  It is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear, therefore, that the persons named after these states of\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter will also be similarly opposed to each otherthat\n\t\t\t\t\tis, the coward (for that is the term that denotes being more afraid\n\t\t\t\t\tthan is proper and less daring than is proper) and the daring man (for\n\t\t\t\t\tthat denotes the characteristic of being less afraid than is proper\n\t\t\t\t\tand more daring than is properand from this the name is\n\t\t\t\t\tderived, as the word 'daring' is cognate with the word 'dare').\n\t\t\t\t\t So that since\n\t\t\t\t\tcourage is the best state of character in relation to feelings of fear\n\t\t\t\t\tand daring, and the proper character is neither that of the daring\n\t\t\t\t\t(for they fall short in one respect and exceed in another) nor that of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cowardly (for they also do the same, only not as regards the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthings but inversely they fall short in\n\t\t\t\t\tdaring and exceed in being afraid), it is clear that the middle state\n\t\t\t\t\tof character between daring and cowardice is courage, for this is the\n\t\t\t\t\tbest state.And it seems that the brave man is in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral fearless, and the coward liable to fear; and that the latter\n\t\t\t\t\tfears things when they are few in number and small in size as well as\n\t\t\t\t\twhen numerous and great, and fears violently, and gets frightened\n\t\t\t\t\tquickly, whereas the former on the contrary either never feels fear at\n\t\t\t\t\tall or only slightly and reluctantly and seldom, and in regard to\n\t\t\t\t\tthings of magnitude; and he endures things that are extremely\n\t\t\t\t\tformidable, whereas the other does not endure even those that are\n\t\t\t\t\tslightly formidable.  What\n\t\t\t\t\tsort of things, then, does the brave man endure? First, is it the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings that are formidable to himself or formidable to somebody else?\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the things formidable to somebody else, one would not indeed call\n\t\t\t\t\tit anything remarkable; but if it is those that are formidable to\n\t\t\t\t\thimself, what is formidable to him must be things of great magnitude\n\t\t\t\t\tand number. But formidable things are productive of fear in the particular person to whom\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are formidablethat is, if they are very formidable,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe fear they produce will be violent, if slightly formidable, it will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe weak; so it follows that the brave man's fears are great and many.\n\t\t\t\t\tYet on the contrary it appeared that courage makes a man fearless, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat fearlessness consists in fearing nothing, or else few things, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthose slightly and reluctantly.  But perhaps 'formidable' is an ambiguous term, like\n\t\t\t\t\t'pleasant' and 'good.' Some things are pleasant and good\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely,whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tothers are so to a particular person but absolutely are not so, but on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe contrary are bad and unpleasantall the things that are\n\t\t\t\t\tbeneficial for the base, and all those that are pleasant to children\n\t\t\t\t\t children.  And similarly some things are formidable\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely and others to a particular person: thus the things that the\n\t\t\t\t\tcoward  coward fears are some of them not\n\t\t\t\t\tformidable to anybody and others only slightly formidable, but things\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are formidable to most men, and all that are formidable to human\n\t\t\t\t\tnature, we pronounce to be formidable absolutely.  But the brave man is fearless\n\t\t\t\t\tin regard to them, and endures formidable things of this sort, which\n\t\t\t\t\tare formidable to him in one way but in another way are\n\t\t\t\t\tnotthey are formidable to him \n\t\t\t\t\thuman being, but  brave not formidable\n\t\t\t\t\texcept slightly, or not at all. Yet such things really are formidable,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor they are formidable to most men.  Owing to this the brave man's state of\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter is praised, because it resembles that of the strong and the\n\t\t\t\t\thealthy. These have those characters not because no labor in the one\n\t\t\t\t\tcase or extreme of temperature in the other can crush them, but\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they are not affected at all, or only affected slightly, by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe things that affect the many or the majority.  Therefore whereas the sickly\n\t\t\t\t\tand weak and cowardly are affected also by the afflictions commonly\n\t\t\t\t\tfelt, only more quickly and to a greater extent than the mass of men,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe healthy, strong and brave, although affected by the very great\n\t\t\t\t\tafflictions, are affected by them more slowly and less than the mass\n\t\t\t\t\tof men, and moreover they are entirely\n\t\t\t\t\tunaffected or only slightly affected by things that affect the\n\t\t\t\t\tmass.But the question is raised whether to the\n\t\t\t\t\tbrave man nothing is formidable, and whether he would be insensible to\n\t\t\t\t\tfear. Or is it not possible that he may feel fear\n\t\t\t\t\tin the way described? For courage is following reason, and reason bids\n\t\t\t\t\tus choose what is fine. Hence he who endures formidable things not on\n\t\t\t\t\taccount of reason is either out of his mind or daring,  but only he who does so from\n\t\t\t\t\tmotives of honor is fearless and brave. The coward, therefore, fears\n\t\t\t\t\teven things that he ought not to fear, and the daring man is bold even\n\t\t\t\t\tabout things about which he ought not to be bold, but the brave man\n\t\t\t\t\talone does both as he ought, and is intermediate in this respect, for\n\t\t\t\t\the feels both confidence and fear about what ever things reason bids;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut reason does not bid him endure things that are extremely painful\n\t\t\t\t\tand destructive, unless they are fine.  The daring man, therefore, faces such things\n\t\t\t\t\twith confidence even if reason does not bid him face them, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tcoward does not face them even if it does, but only the brave man\n\t\t\t\t\tfaces them if reason bids.There are five kinds of courage\n\t\t\t\t\tso called by analogy, because brave men of these kinds endure the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthings as the really courageous but not for the same reasons. One is\n\t\t\t\t\tcivic courage; this is courage due to a sense of shame. Second is\n\t\t\t\t\tmilitary courage; this is due to experience and to knowledge, not of\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is formidable, as Socrates said, but\n\t\t\t\t\tof ways of encountering what is formidable.  Third is the courage due to\n\t\t\t\t\tinexperience and ignorance, that makes children and madmen face things\n\t\t\t\t\trushing on them, or grasp snakes. Another is the courage caused by\n\t\t\t\t\thope, which often makes those who have had a stroke of luck endure\n\t\t\t\t\tdangers,and those who\n\t\t\t\t\tare intoxicatedfor wine makes men sanguine.  Another is due to some\n\t\t\t\t\tirrational emotion, for example love or passion. For if a man is in\n\t\t\t\t\tlove he is more daring than cowardly, and endures many dangers, like\n\t\t\t\t\tthe man who\n\t\t\t\t\tmurdered the tyrant at Metapontium and the person in  in the story; and similarly if a\n\t\t\t\t\tman is under the influence of anger and passion, for passion is a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing that makes him beside himself. Hence wild boars are thought to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe brave, though they are not really, for they are so when they are\n\t\t\t\t\tbeside themselves, but otherwise they are variable, like daring men.\n\t\t\t\t\t But nevertheless\n\t\t\t\t\tthe courage of passion is in the highest degree natural; passion is a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing that does not know defeat, owing to which the young are the best\n\t\t\t\t\tfighters. Civic courage is due to law.  But none of these is truly courage, though\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are all useful for encouragement in dangers.Up to this point we have spoken about things formidable in general\n\t\t\t\t\tterms, but it will be better to define them more precisely. As a\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral term the formidable denotes what causes fear, and that is of a\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty of things that appear capable of causing pain of a\n\t\t\t\t\tdestructive kind: for persons expecting some other pain might perhaps\n\t\t\t\t\texperience a different sort of pain and a different feeling, but will\n\t\t\t\t\tnot have fearfor example if a man foresaw that he was going\n\t\t\t\t\tto feel the pain felt by the jealous, or the sort of pain felt by the\n\t\t\t\t\tenvious or by those who are ashamed.  But fear only occurs in the case of pains that\n\t\t\t\t\tseem likely to be of the kind whose nature it is to destroy life.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence some people who are even very soft\n\t\t\t\t\tabout certain things are brave, and some who are hard and enduring are\n\t\t\t\t\talso cowardly.  Moreover\n\t\t\t\t\tit is thought to be almost a special property of courage to be of a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain disposition in regard to death and the pain of death; for if a\n\t\t\t\t\tman were such as to be capable of rational endurance in respect of\n\t\t\t\t\theat and cold and pains of that sort that are not dangerous, but at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same time soft and excessively timid about death, not because of\n\t\t\t\t\tany other feeling but just because it brings destruction, while\n\t\t\t\t\tanother man was soft in regard to those pains but impassive as regards\n\t\t\t\t\tdeath, the former would be thought a coward and the latter brave.\n\t\t\t\t\t For we speak of\n\t\t\t\t\tdanger only in the case of such formidable things as bring near to us\n\t\t\t\t\twhat causes destruction of that sort, and when this appears near it\n\t\t\t\t\tappears to be danger.The formidable\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, therefore, in relation to which we speak of a man as brave\n\t\t\t\t\tare, we have said, those that appear likely to cause pain of the\n\t\t\t\t\tdestructive kindprovided that these appear close at hand\n\t\t\t\t\tand not far off, and are or appear to be of a magnitude proportionate\n\t\t\t\t\tto a human being;  for\n\t\t\t\t\tsome things must necessarily appear fearful to every human being and\n\t\t\t\t\tthrow everybody into alarm, since it is quite possible that,just as heat and cold and some\n\t\t\t\t\tof the other forces are above us and above the conditions of the human\n\t\t\t\t\tbody, so also are some mental sufferings.Therefore whereas the cowardly and the daring are mistaken owing to\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir characters, since the coward thinks things not formidable\n\t\t\t\t\tformidable and things slightly formidable extremely formidable, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe daring man on the contrary thinks formidable things perfectly safe\n\t\t\t\t\tand extremely formidable things only slightly formidable, to the brave\n\t\t\t\t\tman on the other hand things seem exactly what they are.  Hence a man is not brave if\n\t\t\t\t\the endures formidable things through ignorance (for instance, if owing\n\t\t\t\t\tto madness he were to endure a flight of thunderbolts), nor if he does\n\t\t\t\t\tso owing to passion when knowing the greatness of the danger, as the\n\t\t\t\t\tCelts 'take arms and march against the waves'; and in general, the\n\t\t\t\t\tcourage of barbarians has an element of passion.  And some men endure terrors\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the sake of other pleasures alsofor even passion\n\t\t\t\t\tcontains pleasure of a sort, since it is combined with hope of\n\t\t\t\t\trevenge. But nevertheless neither if a man endures death for the sake\n\t\t\t\t\tof this pleasure nor for another, nor for the sake of avoiding greater\n\t\t\t\t\tpains, would any of these persons justly be termed brave.  For if dying were pleasant,\n\t\t\t\t\tprofligates would be dying constantly, owing to lack of self-control,\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as even as it is, when, although death itself is not pleasant,\n\t\t\t\t\tthings that cause it are, many men through lack of self control\n\t\t\t\t\tknowingly encounter it; none of whom would be thought brave, even\n\t\t\t\t\tthough he were thought to die quite readily. Nor yet are any of those\n\t\t\t\t\tbrave who, as many men do, commit suicide to escape from trouble, as\n\t\t\t\t\tAgathon says: As also Cheiron, in the\n\t\t\t\t\tlegendary story of the poets, because of the pain from his wound\n\t\t\t\t\tprayed that though immortal he might die.  And in like manner to these, all who face\n\t\t\t\t\tdangers because of experience are not brave; this is how perhaps most\n\t\t\t\t\tof the military class face dangers. For the fact is the exact opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tof the view of Socrates, who thought that bravery was knowledge:\n\t\t\t\t\tsailors who know how to go aloft are not daring through knowing what\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are formidable, but because they know how to protect themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst the dangers; also courage is not merely what makes men more\n\t\t\t\t\tdaring fighters,  for in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat case strength and wealth would be courageas Theognis\n\t\t\t\t\tputs it:But manifestly some\n\t\t\t\t\tmen do face emergencies in spite of being cowards, owing to\n\t\t\t\t\texperience, and they do so because they do not think that there is any\n\t\t\t\t\tdanger, as they know how to protect themselves. A proof of this is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat when they think that they have no protection and that the cause\n\t\t\t\t\tof alarm is now close at hand, they turn tail.  But among all such causes, it\n\t\t\t\t\tis when shame makes men face what is alarming that they would appear\n\t\t\t\t\tto be bravest, as Homer says Hector faced the danger of encountering Achilles:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSource unknown\n\t\t\t\t\tand Civic courage is this kind. But true courage\n\t\t\t\t\tis neither this nor any of the others, though it resembles them, as\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes the courage of wild animals, which are led by passion to rush to\n\t\t\t\t\tmeet the blow. For it is not from fear that he will incur disgrace\n\t\t\t\t\tthat a man ought to stand his ground, nor from motives of anger, nor\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause he does not think that he will be killed or because he has\n\t\t\t\t\tforces to protect him, for in that case he will not think that there\n\t\t\t\t\tis really anything to be afraid of.  But, since indeed all goodness involves purposive\n\t\t\t\t\tchoice (it has been said before what we mean by\n\t\t\t\t\tthisgoodness makes a man choose everything for the sake of\n\t\t\t\t\tsome object, and that object is what is fine), it is clear that\n\t\t\t\t\tcourage being a form of goodness will make a man face formidable\n\t\t\t\t\tthings for some object, so that he does not do it through ignorance\n\t\t\t\t\t(for it rather makes him judge correctly), nor yet for pleasure, but\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause it is fine, since in a case where it is not fine but insane he\n\t\t\t\t\twill not face them, for then it would be base to do so.We have now given an account that is fairly adequate for our present\n\t\t\t\t\tprocedure of the kind of things in relation to which Courage is a\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle state, and between what vices and for what reason it is this,\n\t\t\t\t\tand what is the power that formidable things exercise.We must next attempt to decide about Temperance and Profligacy. The\n\t\t\t\t\tterm 'profligate' (unchaste) has a variety of meanings. It means the\n\t\t\t\t\tman who has not been (as it were) 'chastised' or cured, just as\n\t\t\t\t\t'undivided' means one that has not been divided; and these terms\n\t\t\t\t\tinclude both one capable of the process and one not capable of it:\n\t\t\t\t\t'undivided' means both that which cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\tdivided and that which though it can be has not been;  and similarly with\n\t\t\t\t\t'unchaste'it denotes both that which is by nature incapable\n\t\t\t\t\tof chastening and that which, though capable, has not actually been\n\t\t\t\t\tchastened in respect of the errors as regards which the temperate man\n\t\t\t\t\tacts rightly, as is the case with children; for of them it is in this\n\t\t\t\t\tsense that the term 'unchaste' is used,  whereas another use of it again refers to persons hard to cure or\n\t\t\t\t\tentirely incurable by chastisement. But though 'profligacy' has more\n\t\t\t\t\tthan one sense, it is clear that the profligate are concerned with\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain pleasures and pains and that they differ from one another and\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the other vicious characters in being disposed in a certain\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner towards these; and we described previously the way in which we\n\t\t\t\t\tapply the term 'profligacy' by analogy.\n\t\t\t\t\tPersons on the other hand who owing to insensitiveness are\n\t\t\t\t\tuninfluenced by these pleasures are called by some people\n\t\t\t\t\t'insensitive' and by others are designated by other names of the same\n\t\t\t\t\tsort;  but the state is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot a very familiar one nor of common occurrence, because all men err\n\t\t\t\t\tmore in the other direction, and susceptibility and sensitiveness to\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasures of this sort are natural to everybody. It specially attaches\n\t\t\t\t\tto persons like the boors who are a stock character in\n\t\t\t\t\tcomedypeople who steer clear of pleasures even in moderate and necessary\n\t\t\t\t\tindulgences.And since the temperate\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter is shown in connection with pleasures, it follows that it is\n\t\t\t\t\talso related to certain desires. We must, therefore, ascertain what\n\t\t\t\t\tthese are. For the temperate man is not temperate about all pleasures\n\t\t\t\t\tnor about everything pleasant, but apparently about the objects of two\n\t\t\t\t\tof the senses, taste and touch, and in reality about the objects of\n\t\t\t\t\ttouch.  For the temperate\n\t\t\t\t\tman is not concerned with the pleasure of beautiful things (apart from\n\t\t\t\t\tsexual desire) or pain caused by ugly things, the medium of which is\n\t\t\t\t\tsight, nor with the pleasure of harmonious sounds or pain of discords\n\t\t\t\t\tconveyed through the medium of hearing, nor yet with the pleasures and\n\t\t\t\t\tpains of smell, derived from good and bad scents; for neither is\n\t\t\t\t\tanyone termed profligate because of being sensitive or not sensitive\n\t\t\t\t\tto sensations of that sort for example, a man would not be considered\n\t\t\t\t\tprofligate if when looking at a beautiful statue or horse or person,\n\t\t\t\t\tor listening to someone singing, he did not wish for food or drink or\n\t\t\t\t\tsexual indulgence but only wished to look at the beautiful objects or\n\t\t\t\t\tlisten to the music,any more than the persons held\n\t\t\t\t\tspell-bound in the abode of the Sirens.  Temperance and profligacy have to do with those\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo sorts of sensory objects in relation to which alone the lower\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals also happen to be sensitive and to feel pleasure and\n\t\t\t\t\tpainthe objects of taste and of touch,  whereas about virtually all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe pleasures of the other senses alike animals are clearly so\n\t\t\t\t\tconstituted as to be insensitive e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tharmonious sound, or beauty; for clearly they are not affected in any\n\t\t\t\t\tdegree worth speaking of by the mere sight of beautiful objects or by\n\t\t\t\t\tlistening to musical sounds, except possibly in the case of some\n\t\t\t\t\tmiraculous occurrences. Nor yet are they sensitive to good or bad\n\t\t\t\t\tsmells, although it is true that all their senses are keener than\n\t\t\t\t\tman's;  but even the\n\t\t\t\t\tsmells they enjoy are those that have agreeable associations, and are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot intrinsically agreeable. By smells not intrinsically agreeable I\n\t\t\t\t\tmean those that we enjoy because of either anticipation or\n\t\t\t\t\trecollection, for example the smell of things to eat or drink, for we\n\t\t\t\t\tenjoy these scents on account of a different pleasure, that of eating\n\t\t\t\t\tor drinking; by intrinsically agreeable I mean scents such as those of\n\t\t\t\t\tflowers (this is the reason of Stratonicus's neat remark that the scent of\n\t\t\t\t\tflowers is beautiful but that of things to eat and drink sweet).\n\t\t\t\t\t For even the\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasures of taste are not all attractive to animals, nor are those\n\t\t\t\t\tperceived with the tip of the tongue, but those perceived by the\n\t\t\t\t\tthroat, the sensation of which seems more like touch than taste; so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat gourmands do not pray that they may have a long tongue but a\n\t\t\t\t\tcrane's gullet, like Philoxenus son of Eryxis. It\n\t\t\t\t\tfollows that broadly speaking profligacy must be considered to be\n\t\t\t\t\trelated to the objects of touch, and likewise it is with pleasures of\n\t\t\t\t\tthat sort that the profligate is concerned;for tippling and gluttony and lechery and\n\t\t\t\t\tgormandizing and the like all have to do with the sensations\n\t\t\t\t\tspecified, and these are the departments into which profligacy is\n\t\t\t\t\tdivided.  But nobody is\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled profligate if he exceeds in regard to the pleasures of sight or\n\t\t\t\t\thearing or smell; those errors we criticize without severe rebuke, and\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally all the things included under the term 'lack of\n\t\t\t\t\tself-control': the uncontrolled are not profligate, yet they are not\n\t\t\t\t\ttemperate.Therefore the person of such a\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter as to be deficient in all the enjoyments which practically\n\t\t\t\t\teverybody must share and must enjoy, is insensitive (or whatever the\n\t\t\t\t\tproper term is), and he that exceeds in them is profligate.  For all people by nature\n\t\t\t\t\tenjoy these things, and conceive desires for them, without being or\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing called profligate, for they do not exceed by feeling more joy\n\t\t\t\t\tthan they ought when they get them nor more pain than they ought when\n\t\t\t\t\tthey do not get them; nor yet are they unfeeling, for they do not\n\t\t\t\t\tfall short in feeling joy or pain, but rather exceed.And since there are excess and deficiency in regard to these things,\n\t\t\t\t\tit is clear that there is also a middle state, and that this state of\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter is the best one, and is the opposite of both the others.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence if temperance is the best state of character in relation to the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings with which the profligate is concerned, the middle state in\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to the pleasant objects of sense mentioned will be Temperance,\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing a middle state between profligacy and insensitiveness: the\n\t\t\t\t\texcess will be Profligacy, and the deficiency\n\t\t\t\t\twill either be nameless or will be denoted by the terms\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned.\n\t\t\t\t\tWe shall have to define the class of pleasures concerned more exactly\n\t\t\t\t\tin our discussion of Self-control and Lack of Control later\n\t\t\t\t\ton.And also the nature of Gentleness and\n\t\t\t\t\tHarshness must be ascertained in the same way. For we see that the\n\t\t\t\t\tterm 'gentle' is concerned with the pain that arises from\n\t\t\t\t\tpassiona man is gentle by being disposed in a certain way\n\t\t\t\t\ttowards that pain. And in our diagram we opposed to the irascible and harsh and fierce\n\t\t\t\t\tman (for all such traits belong to the same disposition) the slavish\n\t\t\t\t\tand spiritless man;  for these are perhaps the most usual words to\n\t\t\t\t\tdenote those whose passion is not aroused even at all the things at\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it ought to be, but who undergo insulting treatment readily and\n\t\t\t\t\tmeet slights with humility; since as opposed to feeling the pain that\n\t\t\t\t\twe call passion quickly, extremely or for a long time there is feeling\n\t\t\t\t\tit slowly, slightly, or for a short time.  And since, as we said in the other cases, so\n\t\t\t\t\there also there is excess and deficiency (for the harsh man is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsort of man that feels this emotion too quickly, too long, at the\n\t\t\t\t\twrong time, with the wrong kind of people, and with many\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople,while the\n\t\t\t\t\tslavish man is the opposite), it is clear that there is also some body\n\t\t\t\t\twho is at the middle point in the inequality.\n\t\t\t\t\tSince, therefore, both those states of character are wrong, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear that the state midway between them is right, for it is neither\n\t\t\t\t\ttoo hasty nor too slow-tempered, nor does it get angry with the people\n\t\t\t\t\twith whom it ought not nor fail to get angry with those with whom it\n\t\t\t\t\tought. So that since the best state of character in regard to those\n\t\t\t\t\tfeelings is gentleness, Gentleness also would be a middle state, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe gentle man would be midway between the harsh man and the slavish\n\t\t\t\t\tman.Greatness of Spirit and Magnificence and\n\t\t\t\t\tLiberality are also middle states. Liberality is the mean in regard to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe acquisition and expenditure of wealth. The man who is more pleased\n\t\t\t\t\tthan he ought to be by all acquisition and more pained than he ought\n\t\t\t\t\tto be by all expenditure is mean, he that feels both feelings less\n\t\t\t\t\tthan he ought is prodigal, and he that feels both as he ought is\n\t\t\t\t\tliberal (what I mean by 'as he ought,' both in this and in the other\n\t\t\t\t\tcases, is 'as right principle directs').  And since the two former characters consist in\n\t\t\t\t\texcess and deficiency, and where there are extremes there is also a\n\t\t\t\t\tmean, and that mean is best, there being a single best for each kind\n\t\t\t\t\tof action, a single thing, it necessarily follows that liberality is a\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle state between prodigality and meanness as regards getting and\n\t\t\t\t\tparting with wealth.  But\n\t\t\t\t\tthe terms 'wealth' and 'art of wealth' we use in two senses, since one\n\t\t\t\t\tway of using an article of property, for example\n\t\t\t\t\ta shoe or a cloak, is proper to the article itself, another is accidental, though\n\t\t\t\t\tnot as using a shoe for a weight would be an accidental use of it, but\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example selling it or letting it on hire, for these uses do employ\n\t\t\t\t\tit as a shoe.  The\n\t\t\t\t\tcovetous man is the party whose interest centers on money, and money\n\t\t\t\t\tis a thing of ownership instead of accidental use.  But the mean man might be even\n\t\t\t\t\tprodigal in regard to the accidental mode of getting wealth, inasmuch\n\t\t\t\t\tas it is in the natural acquisition of wealth that he pursues\n\t\t\t\t\tincrease. The prodigal man lacks necessities, but the liberal man\n\t\t\t\t\tgives his superfluity. \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd of these classes themselves there are species designated as\n\t\t\t\t\texceeding or deficient in respect of parts of the matter concerned:\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example, the stingy man, the skinflint and the profiteer are\n\t\t\t\t\tmeanthe stingy in not parting with money, the profiteer in\n\t\t\t\t\taccepting anything, the skinflint is he who is very excited about\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall sums; also the man who offends by way of meanness is a false\n\t\t\t\t\treckoner and a cheat. \n\t\t\t\t\tSimilarly 'prodigal' includes the spendthrift who is prodigal in\n\t\t\t\t\tunregulated spending and the reckless man who is prodigal in not being\n\t\t\t\t\table to endure the pain of calculation.On the subject of\n\t\t\t\t\tGreatness of Spirit we must define its characteristic from the\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes of the great-spirited man.For just as in the other cases of things\n\t\t\t\t\tthat, owing to their affinity and similarity up to a point, are not\n\t\t\t\t\tnoticed to differ when they advance further, the same has happened\n\t\t\t\t\tabout greatness of spirit.  Hence sometimes the opposite characters claim the same quality, for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance the extravagant man claims to be the same as the liberal, the\n\t\t\t\t\tself-willed as the proud, the daring as the brave; for they are\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned with the same things, and also are neighbors up to a point,\n\t\t\t\t\tas the brave man can endure dangers and so can the daring man, but the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer in one way and the latter in another, and that makes a very\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat difference.  And we\n\t\t\t\t\tuse the term 'great-spirited' according to the designation of the\n\t\t\t\t\tword, as consisting in a certain greatness or power of spirit. So that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe great-spirited man seems to resemble both the proud man and the\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnificent, because greatness of spirit seems to go with all the\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtues also.  For it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpraiseworthy to judge great and small goods rightly; and those goods\n\t\t\t\t\tseem great which a man pursues who possesses the best state of\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter in relation to such pleasures, and greatness of spirit is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best.  And the virtue\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned with each thing judges rightly the greater and the smaller\n\t\t\t\t\tgood, just as the wise man and virtue would bid, so that all the\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtues go with it, or it goes with all the virtues.Again, it is thought characteristic of the great-spirited man to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdisdainful. Each virtue makes men disdainful of things irrationally\n\t\t\t\t\tdeemed great: for example, courage makes a man\n\t\t\t\t\tdisdainful of dangers, for he thinks that to consider danger a great\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter is a disgraceful thing, and that numbers are not always\n\t\t\t\t\tformidable; and the sober-minded man disdains great and numerous\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasures, and the liberal man wealth.  But the reason why this is thought\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristic of the great-spirited man is because of his caring\n\t\t\t\t\tabout few things and those great ones, and not about whatever somebody\n\t\t\t\t\telse thinks. And a great-spirited man would consider more what one\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtuous man thinks than what many ordinary people think, as Antiphon\n\t\t\t\t\tafter his condemnation said to Agathon when he praised his speech for\n\t\t\t\t\this defence. And a feeling thought to be specially\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristic of the great-spirited man is disdain.  On the other hand, as to the\n\t\t\t\t\taccepted objects of human interest, honor, life, wealth, he is thought\n\t\t\t\t\tto care nothing about any of them except honor; it would grieve him to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe dishonored and ruled by someone unworthy, and his greatest joy is\n\t\t\t\t\tto obtain honor.Thus he might therefore be thought\n\t\t\t\t\tinconsistent, on the ground that to be specially concerned about honor\n\t\t\t\t\tand to be disdainful of the multitude and of reputation do not go\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether.  But in saying\n\t\t\t\t\tthis we must distinguish. Honor is small or great in two ways: it\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffers in being conferred either by many ordinary people or by\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons of consideration, and again it differs in what it is conferred\n\t\t\t\t\tfor,since its\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatness does not depend only on the number or the quality of those\n\t\t\t\t\twho confer it, but also on its being honorable; and in reality those\n\t\t\t\t\toffices and other good things are honorable and worthy of serious\n\t\t\t\t\tpursuit that are truly great, so that there is no goodness without\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatness; owing to which each of the virtues seems to make men\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat-spirited in regard to the things with which that virtue is\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned, as we said. But\n\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless there is a single virtue of greatness of spirit side by\n\t\t\t\t\tside with the other virtues, so that the possessor of this virtue must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe termed great-spirited in a special sense. And since there are\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain goods which are in some cases honorable and in others not,\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to the distinction made before, and of goods of this sort\n\t\t\t\t\tsome are truly great and others small, and some men deserve and claim\n\t\t\t\t\tthe former, it is among these men that the great-spirited man must be\n\t\t\t\t\tlooked for.  And there\n\t\t\t\t\tare necessarily four varieties of claim: it is possible to deserve\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat things and to claim them as one's desert; and there are small\n\t\t\t\t\tthings and a man may deserve and claim things of that size; and as\n\t\t\t\t\tregards each of these two classes of things the reverse is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossibleone man may be of such a character that although\n\t\t\t\t\tdeserving small things he claims great onesthe goods held\n\t\t\t\t\tin high honor, and another man though deserving great things may claim\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall ones.  Now the man\n\t\t\t\t\tworthy of small things but claiming great ones is blameworthy, for it\n\t\t\t\t\tis foolish and not fine to obtain what does not correspond to one's\n\t\t\t\t\tdeserts. And he also is blameworthy who though worthy of such things\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not deem himself worthy to partake of them although they are\n\t\t\t\t\tavailable for him.  But there is left here the man who is the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite of both of these, who being worthy of great things claims\n\t\t\t\t\tthem as his desert, and is of such a character as to\n\t\t\t\t\tdeem himself worthy: he is\n\t\t\t\t\tpraiseworthy, and he is in the middle between the two.  Since, therefore, greatness\n\t\t\t\t\tof spirit is the best disposition in relation to the choice and the\n\t\t\t\t\temployment of honor and of the other good things that are esteemed,\n\t\t\t\t\tand not in relation to useful things, and since we assign this to the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat-spirited man, and since also at the same time the middle state\n\t\t\t\t\tis most praiseworthy, it is clear that even greatness of spirit must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe a middle state.  And\n\t\t\t\t\tof the opposites as shown in our diagram, the one in the direction of\n\t\t\t\t\tdeeming oneself worthy of great goods when one is not worthy is vanity\n\t\t\t\t\t(for the sort of men that fancy themselves worthy of great things\n\t\t\t\t\tthough they are not we call vain), and the one that is concerned with\n\t\t\t\t\tnot deeming oneself worthy of great things when one is worthy of them\n\t\t\t\t\tis smallness of spirit (for if a man does not think himself worthy of\n\t\t\t\t\tanything great although he possesses qualities which would justly make\n\t\t\t\t\thim considered worthy of it, he is thought small-spirited); so that it\n\t\t\t\t\tfollows that greatness of spirit is a middle state between vanity and\n\t\t\t\t\tsmallness of spirit.  But\n\t\t\t\t\tthe fourth of the persons in our classification is neither entirely\n\t\t\t\t\treprehensible nor is he great spirited, as he is concerned with\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing possessing greatness, for he neither is nor thinks himself\n\t\t\t\t\tworthy of great things; owing to which he is not the opposite of the\n\t\t\t\t\tman of great spirit.Yet\n\t\t\t\t\tthinking oneself worthy of small things when one is worthy of small\n\t\t\t\t\tthings might be thought the opposite of thinking oneself worthy of\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat ones when one is worthy of great ones;  but he is not opposite to the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat-spirited man because he is not blameworthy either, for his\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter is as reason bids, and in nature he is the same as the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat-spirited man, for both claim as their desert the things that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are worthy of.  And\n\t\t\t\t\the might become great-spirited, for he will claim the things that he\n\t\t\t\t\tis worthy of; whereas the small-spirited man, who when great goods\n\t\t\t\t\tcorresponding to his worth are available does not think himself worthy\n\t\t\t\t\tof themwhat would he have done if his deserts were small?\n\t\t\t\t\tFor either he would have conceitedly thought himself worthy of great\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, or of still less. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tnobody would call a man small-spirited for not claiming to hold office\n\t\t\t\t\tand submitting to authority if he is a resident alien, but one would\n\t\t\t\t\tdo so if he were of noble birth and attached great importance to\n\t\t\t\t\toffice.The Magnificent Man also (except in a case\n\t\t\t\t\twhen we are using the term metaphorically) is not concerned with any\n\t\t\t\t\tand every action and purposive choice, but with expenditure. Without\n\t\t\t\t\texpenditure there is no magnificence, for it is what is appropriate in\n\t\t\t\t\tornament, and ornament does not result from any chance expenditure,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut consists in going beyond the merely necessary.  Therefore the magnificent man\n\t\t\t\t\tis the man who purposively chooses the appropriate greatness in great\n\t\t\t\t\texpenditure, and who even on the occasion of a pleasure of this nature aims at this\n\t\t\t\t\tsort of moderation.  There\n\t\t\t\t\tis no name denoting the man who likes spending to excess and\n\t\t\t\t\tinappropriately; however the persons whom some people call tasteless\n\t\t\t\t\tand swaggering have a certain affinity to him.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor instance if a rich man spending money on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe wedding of a favorite thinks it fitting for him to have the sort\n\t\t\t\t\tof arrangements that would be fitting when entertaining\n\t\t\t\t\tabstainers, he is shabby, while one who entertains\n\t\t\t\t\tguests of that sort after the manner of a wedding feast, if he does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot do it for the sake of reputation or to gain an office, resembles\n\t\t\t\t\tthe swaggerer; but he that entertains suitably and as reason directs\n\t\t\t\t\tis magnificent, for the fitting is the suitable, as nothing is fitting\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is unsuitable.  But\n\t\t\t\t\tit must be fitting in each particular, that is, in suitability to the\n\t\t\t\t\tagent and to the recipient and to the occasionfor example,\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is fitting at the wedding of a servant is not what is fitting at\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of a favorite; and it is fitting for the agent himself, if it is\n\t\t\t\t\tof an amount or quality suitable to himfor example people\n\t\t\t\t\tthought that the mission that Themistocles conducted to  was not fitting for\n\t\t\t\t\thim, because of his former low station, but would have been for\n\t\t\t\t\tCimon. But\n\t\t\t\t\the who is casual in regard to the question of suitability is not in\n\t\t\t\t\tany of these classes.Similarly in\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to liberality: a man may be neither liberal nor\n\t\t\t\t\tilliberal.Generally speaking the other praiseworthy\n\t\t\t\t\tand blameworthy states of character also are excesses or deficiencies\n\t\t\t\t\tor middle states, but in respect of an emotion: for instance, the\n\t\t\t\t\tenvious man and the malicious. Forto take the states of\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter after which they are namedEnvy means being pained at people who are\n\t\t\t\t\tdeservedly prosperous, while the emotion of the malicious man is\n\t\t\t\t\titself nameless, but the possessor of it is shown by his feeling joy\n\t\t\t\t\tat undeserved adversities;  and midway between them is the righteously indignant man, and what\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ancients called Righteous Indignationfeeling pain at\n\t\t\t\t\tundeserved adversities and prosperities and pleasure at those that are\n\t\t\t\t\tdeserved; hence the idea that Nemesis is a deity.Modesty is a middle state between Shamelessness and Bashfulness: the\n\t\t\t\t\tman who pays regard to nobody's opinion is shameless, he who regards\n\t\t\t\t\teverybody's is bashful, he who regards the opinion of those who appear\n\t\t\t\t\tgood is modest.Friendliness is a middle state between\n\t\t\t\t\tAnimosity and Flattery; the man who accommodates himself readily to\n\t\t\t\t\this associates' desires in everything is a flatterer, he who runs\n\t\t\t\t\tcounter to them all shows animosity, he who neither falls in with nor\n\t\t\t\t\tresists every pleasure, but falls in with what seems to be the best,\n\t\t\t\t\tis friendly.Dignity is a middle state between Self-will\n\t\t\t\t\tand Obsequiousness. A man who in his conduct pays no regard at all to\n\t\t\t\t\tanother but is contemptuous is self-willed; he who regards another in\n\t\t\t\t\teverything and is inferior to everybody is obsequious; he who regards\n\t\t\t\t\tanother in some things but not in others, and is regardful of persons\n\t\t\t\t\tworthy of regard, is dignified.The truthful and sincere\n\t\t\t\t\tman, called 'downright,' is midway between the dissembler and the\n\t\t\t\t\tcharlatan. He that wittingly makes a false statement against himself\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is depreciatory is a dissembler, he that\n\t\t\t\t\texaggerates his merits is a charlatan, he that speaks of himself as he\n\t\t\t\t\tis is truthful and in Homer's phrase 'sagacious'; and in general the\n\t\t\t\t\tone is a lover of truth and the others lovers of falsehood.Wittiness also\n\t\t\t\t\tis a middle state, and the witty man is midway between the boorish or\n\t\t\t\t\tstiff man and the buffoon. For just as in the matter of food the\n\t\t\t\t\tsqueamish man differs from the omnivorous in that the former takes\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing or little, and that reluctantly, and the latter accepts\n\t\t\t\t\teverything readily, so the boor stands in relation to the vulgar man\n\t\t\t\t\tor buffoonthe former takes no joke except with difficulty,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe latter accepts everything easily and with pleasure. Neither course\n\t\t\t\t\tis right: one should allow some things and not others, and on\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple,that constitutes the witty man.  The proof of the formula is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same as in the other cases: wittiness of this kind (not the\n\t\t\t\t\tquality to which\n\t\t\t\t\twe apply the term in a transferred sense) is a very becoming sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter, and also a middle state is praiseworthy, whereas extremes\n\t\t\t\t\tare blameworthy. But as there are two kinds of wit (one consisting in\n\t\t\t\t\tliking a joke, even one that tells against oneself if it is funny, for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance a jeer, the other in the ability to produce things of this\n\t\t\t\t\tsort), these kinds of wit differ from one another, but both are middle\n\t\t\t\t\tstates; for a man who can produce\n\t\t\t\t\tjokes of a sort that will give pleasure to a person of good judgement\n\t\t\t\t\teven though the laugh is against himself will be midway between the\n\t\t\t\t\tvulgar man and the frigid. This is a better definition than that the\n\t\t\t\t\tthing said must not be painful to the victim whatever sort of man he\n\t\t\t\t\tmay berather, it must give pleasure to the man in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle position, since his judgement is good.All these middle states, though praiseworthy, are not virtues, nor\n\t\t\t\t\tare the opposite states vices, for they do not involve purposive\n\t\t\t\t\tchoice; they are all in the classification of the emotions, for each\n\t\t\t\t\tof them is an emotion. \n\t\t\t\t\tBut because they are natural they contribute to the natural virtues;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor, as will be said in what follows, each virtue exists\n\t\t\t\t\tboth naturally and otherwise, that is, in conjunction with thought.\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore envy\n\t\t\t\t\tcontributes to injustice (for the actions that spring from it affect\n\t\t\t\t\tanother person), and righteous indignation to justice, and modesty to\n\t\t\t\t\ttemperance (owing to which people even define temperance as a species\n\t\t\t\t\tof emotion), and the sincere and false are respectively wise and\n\t\t\t\t\tfoolish.And the mean is more\n\t\t\t\t\topposed to the extremes than the extremes are to one another,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the mean does not occur in\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination with either extreme, whereas the extremes often do occur\n\t\t\t\t\tin combination with one another, and sometimes the same men are\n\t\t\t\t\tventuresome cowards, or extravagant in some things and illiberal in\n\t\t\t\t\tothers, and in general not uniform in a bad way for when men lack uniformity\n\t\t\t\t\tin a good way, this results in men of the middle characters, since the\n\t\t\t\t\tmean contains both extremes.The\n\t\t\t\t\topposition existing between the mean and the extremes does not seem to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe the same in the case of both the extremes, but sometimes the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreater opposition is by way of excess, sometimes by way of\n\t\t\t\t\tdeficiency.  The causes\n\t\t\t\t\tof this are partly the two first mentioned, rarity (for example, the rarity of people\n\t\t\t\t\tinsensitive to pleasant things) and the fact that the error to which\n\t\t\t\t\twe are more prone seems more opposite to the mean,  and thirdly the fact that the\n\t\t\t\t\textreme that more resembles the mean seems less opposite to it, as is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case with daring in relation to boldness and extravagance in relation\n\t\t\t\t\tto liberality. We have therefore sufficiently discussed the other\n\t\t\t\t\tpraiseworthy virtues, and must now speak about Justice."}}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "7", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n":

For to\n\t\t\t\t\tpromote friendship is thought to be the special task of political\n\t\t\t\t\tscience; and people say that it is on this account that goodness is a\n\t\t\t\t\tvaluable thing, for persons wrongfully treated by one another cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tbe each other's friends. \n\t\t\t\t\tFurthermore we all say that justice and injustice are chiefly\n\t\t\t\t\tdisplayed towards friends; it is thought that a good man is a friendly\n\t\t\t\t\tman, and that friendship is a state of the moral character; and if one\n\t\t\t\t\twishes to make men not act unjustly, it is enough to make them\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends, for true friends do not wrong one another.  But neither will men act\n\t\t\t\t\tunjustly if they are just; therefore justice and friendship are either\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same or nearly the same thing.In addition to this, we\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider a friend to be one of the greatest goods, and friendlessness\n\t\t\t\t\tand solitude a very terrible thing, because the whole of life and\n\t\t\t\t\tvoluntary association is with friends; for we pass\n\t\t\t\t\tour days with our family or relations or comrades, children, parents\n\t\t\t\t\tor wife.  And our private\n\t\t\t\t\trights in relation to our friends depend only on ourselves, whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tour rights in relation to the rest of men are established by law and\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not depend on us.Many questions are raised about\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendshipfirst, on the line of those who take in wider\n\t\t\t\t\tconsiderations and extend the term. For some hold that like is friend\n\t\t\t\t\tto like, whence the sayings:; ;\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd thief knows thief and wolf his fellow\n\t\t\t\t\twolf.And the natural philosophers\n\t\t\t\t\teven arrange the whole of nature in a system by assuming as a first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple that like goes to like, owing to which Empedocles said that the dog sits on the tiling because it is most\n\t\t\t\t\tlike him.Some people then give this account of a friend; but others say that\n\t\t\t\t\topposite is dear to opposite, since it is what is loved and desired\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is dear to everybody, and the dry does not desire the dry but the\n\t\t\t\t\twet (whence the sayings\"Earth loveth rain,\" and \"In all things change is\n\t\t\t\t\tsweet\" change being transition to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe opposite), whereas like hates like, for \"Potter against potter has\n\t\t\t\t\ta grudge,\" and animals\n\t\t\t\t\tthat live on the same food are hostile to one another. These opinions, therefore, are thus widely\n\t\t\t\t\tvariant. One party thinks that the like is friend and the opposite foeand moreover\n\t\t\t\t\tadversaries are separated in locality, whereas friendship seems to\n\t\t\t\t\tbring men together. The other party say that opposites are friends,\n\t\t\t\t\tand Heracleitus rebukes the poet who wrote for, he says, there would be no harmony without high and low\n\t\t\t\t\tnotes, and no animals without male and female, which are\n\t\t\t\t\topposites.These, then, are two opinions\n\t\t\t\t\tabout friendship, and being so widely separated they are too\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral; but there are\n\t\t\t\t\tothers that are closer together and more akin to the facts of\n\t\t\t\t\tobservation. Some persons think that it is not possible for bad men to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe friends, but only for the good. Others think it strange that\n\t\t\t\t\tmothers should not love their own children  (and maternal affection we see existing even\n\t\t\t\t\tamong animalsat least, animals choose to die for their\n\t\t\t\t\tyoung).  Others hold that\n\t\t\t\t\tonly what is useful is a friend, the proof being that all men actually\n\t\t\t\t\tdo pursue the useful, and discard what is useless even in their own\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons (as the old Socrates used\n\t\t\t\t\tto say, instancing spittle, hair and nails), and that we throw away\n\t\t\t\t\teven parts of the body that are of no use, and finally the body\n\t\t\t\t\titself, when it dies, as a corpse is\n\t\t\t\t\tuselessbut people that have a use for it keep it, as in\n\t\t\t\t\t.  Now all these factors seem to be somewhat opposed to one\n\t\t\t\t\tanother. For like is of no use to like and opposition is farthest\n\t\t\t\t\tremoved from likeness, and at the same time opposite is most useless\n\t\t\t\t\tto opposite, since opposite is destructive of opposite.  Moreover some think that to\n\t\t\t\t\tgain a friend is easy, but others that it is the rarest thing to\n\t\t\t\t\trecognize a friend, and not possible without misfortune, as everybody\n\t\t\t\t\twants to be thought a friend of the prosperous;  and others maintain that we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust not trust even those who stay with us in our misfortunes, because\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are deceiving us and pretending, in order that by associating\n\t\t\t\t\twith us when unfortunate they may gain our friendship when we are\n\t\t\t\t\tagain prosperous.Accordingly a line of argument\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be taken that will best explain to us the views held on these\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters and at the same time solve the difficulties and\n\t\t\t\t\tcontradictions. And this will be secured if the contradictory views\n\t\t\t\t\tare shown to be held with some reason. For such a line of argument\n\t\t\t\t\twill be most in agreement with the observed facts: and in the upshot,\n\t\t\t\t\tif what is said is true in one sense but not true in another, both the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontradictory views stand good.There is also a question\n\t\t\t\t\tas to whether what is dear to us is the pleasant or the\n\t\t\t\t\tgood.If we hold dear\n\t\t\t\t\twhat we desire (and that is specially characteristic of love, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\"None is a lover that holds not dear for aye\"), and\n\t\t\t\t\tdesire is for what is pleasant, on this showing it is the pleasant\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is dear; whereas if we hold dear what we wish, it is the good;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut the pleasant and the good are different things.We must therefore attempt to decide about these matters and others\n\t\t\t\t\takin to them, taking as a starting point the following. The thing\n\t\t\t\t\tdesired and wished is either the good or the apparent good. Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\talso the pleasant is desired, for it is an apparent good, since some\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople think it good, and to others it appears good even though they\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not think it so (as appearance and opinion are not in the same part\n\t\t\t\t\tof the spirit). Yet it is clear that both the\n\t\t\t\t\tgood and the pleasant are dear.This being decided, we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust make another assumption. Things good are some of them absolutely\n\t\t\t\t\tgood, others good for someone but not good absolutely; and the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are absolutely good and absolutely pleasant. For things\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantageous for a healthy body we pronounce good for the body\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely, but things good for a sick body notfor example\n\t\t\t\t\tdoses of medicine and surgical operations;  and likewise also the things pleasant for a\n\t\t\t\t\thealthy and perfect body are pleasant for the body absolutely, for\n\t\t\t\t\texample to live in the light and not in the dark, although the reverse\n\t\t\t\t\tis the case for a man with ophthalmia. And the pleasanter wine is not\n\t\t\t\t\tthe wine pleasant to a man whose palate has been corrupted by\n\t\t\t\t\ttippling, since sometimes they pour in a dash of vinegar, but to the\n\t\t\t\t\tuncorrupted taste. And similarly also in the case of the spirit,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe really pleasant things are not those pleasant to children and\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals, but those pleasant to the adult; at least it is these that we\n\t\t\t\t\tprefer when we remember both.  And as a child or animal stands to an adult human\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing, so the bad and foolish man stands to the good and wise man; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthese take pleasure in things that correspond to their characters, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthese are things good and fine.Since therefore good is\n\t\t\t\t\ta term of more than one meaning (for we call one thing good because\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is its essential nature, but another because it is serviceable\n\t\t\t\t\tand useful), and furthermore pleasant includes both what is absolutely\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant and absolutely good and what is pleasant for somebody and\n\t\t\t\t\tapparently good, as in the case of inanimate objects we may\n\t\t\t\t\tchoose a thing and love it for each of these reasons, so also in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase of a human being, one man we love because of his character, and\n\t\t\t\t\tfor goodness, another because he is serviceable and useful, another\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause he is pleasant, and for pleasure. And a man becomes a friend\n\t\t\t\t\twhen while receiving affection he returns it, and when he and the\n\t\t\t\t\tother are in some way aware of this.It follows, therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat there are three sorts of friendship, and that they are not all so\n\t\t\t\t\ttermed in respect of one thing or as species of one genus, nor yet\n\t\t\t\t\thave they the same name entirely by accident. For all these uses of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe term are related to one particular sort of friendship which is\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary, like the term 'surgical'and we speak of a surgical\n\t\t\t\t\tmind and a surgical hand and a surgical instrument and a surgical\n\t\t\t\t\toperation,but we\n\t\t\t\t\tapply the term properly to that which is primarily so called.\n\t\t\t\t\t The primary is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of which the definition is implicit in the definition of all, for\n\t\t\t\t\texample a surgical instrument is an instrument that a surgeon would\n\t\t\t\t\tuse, whereas the definition of the instrument is not implicit in that\n\t\t\t\t\tof surgeon.  Therefore in\n\t\t\t\t\tevery case people seek the primary, and because the universal is\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary they assume that also the primary is universal; but this is\n\t\t\t\t\tuntrue. Hence in the case of friendship, they cannot take account of\n\t\t\t\t\tall the observed facts. For as one definition does not fit, they think\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the other kinds of friendship are not friendships at all; but\n\t\t\t\t\treally they are, although not in the same way,  but when they find that the\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary friendship does not fit, assuming that it would be universal\n\t\t\t\t\tif it really were primary, they say that the others are not\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendships at all.  But\n\t\t\t\t\tin reality there are many kinds of friendships: this was among the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings said already, as we have distinguished three senses of the term\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendshipone sort has been defined as based on goodness,\n\t\t\t\t\tanother on utility, another on pleasure.Of these the one\n\t\t\t\t\tbased on utility is assuredly the friendship of most people; for they\n\t\t\t\t\tlove one another because they are useful, and in so far as they are\n\t\t\t\t\tand so, as says the proverbGlaucus, an ally is a\n\t\t\t\t\tfriend, as long as he our battle fights, and  On the other hand\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship based on pleasure is the friendship of the young, for they\n\t\t\t\t\thave a sense of what is pleasant; hence young people's friendship\n\t\t\t\t\teasily changes, for since their characters change as they grow up,\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir taste in pleasure also changes. But the friendship in conformity\n\t\t\t\t\twith goodness is the friendship of the best men. It is clear from this that the primary\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship, that of the good, is mutual reciprocity of affection and\n\t\t\t\t\tpurpose. For the object of affection is dear to the giver of it, but\n\t\t\t\t\talso the giver of affection is himself dear to the object.  This friendship, therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\tonly occurs in man, for he alone perceives purpose; but the other\n\t\t\t\t\tforms occur also in the lower animals. Indeed mutual utility\n\t\t\t\t\tmanifestly exists to some small extent between the domestic animals\n\t\t\t\t\tand man, and between animals themselves, for instance Herodotus's\n\t\t\t\t\taccount of the friendship between the crocodile and the\n\t\t\t\t\tsandpiper, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tperching together and separating of birds of which soothsayers speak.\n\t\t\t\t\t The bad may be\n\t\t\t\t\teach other's friends from motives both of utility and of pleasure;\n\t\t\t\t\t though some say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they are not really friends, because the primary kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship does not belong to them, since obviously a bad man will\n\t\t\t\t\tinjure a bad man, and those who suffer injury from one another do not\n\t\t\t\t\tfeel affection for one another.  But as a matter of fact bad men do feel affection for\n\t\t\t\t\tone another, though not according to the primary form of\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendshipbecause clearly nothing hinders their being\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends under the other forms, since for the sake of pleasure they put\n\t\t\t\t\tup with one another although they are being harmed, so long as they\n\t\t\t\t\tare lacking in self-restraint.  The view is also held, when people look into the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter closely, that those who feel affection for each other on\n\t\t\t\t\taccount of pleasure are not friends, because it is not the primary\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship, since that is reliable but this is unreliable.But as a matter of fact it is\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship, as has been said, though not that sort of friendship but\n\t\t\t\t\tone derived from it. \n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore to confine the use of the term friend to that form of\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship alone is to do violence to observed facts, and compels one\n\t\t\t\t\tto talk paradoxes; though it is not possible to bring all friendship\n\t\t\t\t\tunder one definition. \n\t\t\t\t\tThe only remaining alternative, therefore, is, that in a sense the\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary sort of friendship alone is friendship, but in a sense all\n\t\t\t\t\tsorts are, not as having a common name by accident and standing in a\n\t\t\t\t\tmerely chance relationship to one another, nor yet as falling under\n\t\t\t\t\tone species, but rather as related to one thing.And since the same thing is absolutely good and absolutely pleasant\n\t\t\t\t\tat the same time if nothing interferes, and the true friend and friend\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely is the primary friend, and such is a friend chosen in and\n\t\t\t\t\tfor himself (and he must necessarily be such, for he for whom one\n\t\t\t\t\twishes good for his own sake must necessarily be desirable for his own\n\t\t\t\t\tsake),  a true friend is\n\t\t\t\t\talso absolutely pleasant; owing to which it is thought that a friend\n\t\t\t\t\tof any sort is pleasant. \n\t\t\t\t\tBut we must define this still further, for it is debatable whether\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is good merely for oneself is dear or what is absolutely good,\n\t\t\t\t\tand whether the actual exercise of affection is accompanied by\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure, so that an object of affection is also pleasant, or not.\n\t\t\t\t\tBoth questions must be brought to the same issue; for things not\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely good but possibly evil are to be avoided, and also a thing\n\t\t\t\t\tnot good for oneself is no concern of oneself, but what is sought for\n\t\t\t\t\tis that things absolutely good shall be good for oneself.  For the absolutely good is\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely desirable, but what is good for oneself is desirable for\n\t\t\t\t\toneself; and the two ought to come into agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is effected by goodness; and the purpose of political science is\n\t\t\t\t\tto bring it about in cases where it does not yet exist. And one who is\n\t\t\t\t\ta human being is well adapted to this and on the way to it (for by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature things that are absolutely good are good to him),  and similarly a man rather\n\t\t\t\t\tthan a woman and a gifted man rather than a dull one; but the road is\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough pleasureit is necessary that fine things shall be\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant. When there is discord between them, a man is not yet\n\t\t\t\t\tperfectly good; for it is possible for unrestraint to be engendered in\n\t\t\t\t\thim, as unrestraint is caused by discord between the good and the\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant in the emotions.Therefore since the primary\n\t\t\t\t\tsort of friendship is in accordance with goodness, friends of this\n\t\t\t\t\tsort will be absolutely good in themselves also, and this not because\n\t\t\t\t\tof being useful, but in another manner.  For good for a given person and good\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely are twofold; and the same is the case with states of\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter as with profitablenesswhat is profitable\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely and what is profitable for given persons are different\n\t\t\t\t\tthings (just as taking exercise is a different thing from taking\n\t\t\t\t\tdrugs). So the state of character called human goodness is of two\n\t\t\t\t\tkinds\n\t\t\t\t\tfor let us assume that man is one of the things that are excellent by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature: consequently the goodness of a thing excellent by nature is\n\t\t\t\t\tgood absolutely, but that of a thing not excellent by nature is only\n\t\t\t\t\tgood for that thing.The case of the pleasant also,\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, is similar. For here we must pause and consider whether\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is any friendship without pleasure,and how such a friendship differs from other\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship, and on which exactly of the two things the affection\n\t\t\t\t\tdependsdo we love a man because he is good even if he is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot pleasant, but not because he is pleasant? Then, affection having\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo meanings, does actual affection seem to involve pleasure\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause activity is good?  It is clear that as in science recent studies and acquirements are\n\t\t\t\t\tmost fully apprehended, because of their pleasantness, so with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe recognition of familiar things, and the principle is the same in\n\t\t\t\t\tboth cases. By nature at all events the absolutely good is absolutely\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant, and the relatively good is pleasant to those for whom it is\n\t\t\t\t\tgood. Hence ipso facto like takes pleasure in like, and man\n\t\t\t\t\tis the thing most pleasant to man; so that as this is so even with\n\t\t\t\t\timperfect things, it is clearly so with things when perfected, and a\n\t\t\t\t\tgood man is a perfect man. And if active affection is the reciprocal\n\t\t\t\t\tchoice, accompanied by pleasure, of one another's acquaintance, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear that friendship of the primary kind is in general the reciprocal\n\t\t\t\t\tchoice of things absolutely good and pleasant because they are good\n\t\t\t\t\tand pleasant;  and\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship itself is a state from which such choice arises. For its\n\t\t\t\t\tfunction is an activity, but this not external but within the lover\n\t\t\t\t\thimself; whereas the function of every faculty is external, for it is\n\t\t\t\t\teither in another or in oneself  other.\n\t\t\t\t\t Hence to love is\n\t\t\t\t\tto feel pleasure but to be loved is not; for being loved is not an\n\t\t\t\t\tactivity of the thing loved, whereas loving is an\n\t\t\t\t\tactivitythe activity of friendship; and loving occurs only\n\t\t\t\t\tin an animate thing, whereas being loved occurs with an inanimate\n\t\t\t\t\tthing also, for even inanimate things are loved.  And since to love actively is\n\t\t\t\t\tto treat the loved object  loved, and the friend is an object of love to the friend  dear to him but not  musician or medical man, the pleasure of friendship is the\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure derived from the person himself \n\t\t\t\t\thimself; for the friend loves him as himself, not because he is\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else. Consequently if he does not take pleasure in him  good, it is not the primary friendship.\n\t\t\t\t\t Nor ought any\n\t\t\t\t\taccidental quality to cause more hindrance than the friend's goodness\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses delight; for surely, if a person is very evil-smelling, people\n\t\t\t\t\tcut himhe must be content with our goodwill, he must not\n\t\t\t\t\texpect our society!This then is the\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary friendship, which all people recognize.  It is on account of it that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other sorts are considered to be friendship, and also that their\n\t\t\t\t\tclaim is disputedfor friendship seems to be some thing\n\t\t\t\t\tstable, and only this friendship is stable; for a formed judgement is\n\t\t\t\t\tstable, and not doing things quickly or easily makes the judgement\n\t\t\t\t\tright.  And there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tstable friendship without confidence, and confidence only comes with\n\t\t\t\t\ttime; for it is necessary to make trial, as Theognis says: Those who become friends without the test of time are not real\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends but only wish to be friends; and such a character very readily\n\t\t\t\t\tpasses for friendship, because when\n\t\t\t\t\teager to be friends they think that by rendering each other all\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendly services they do not merely wish to be friends but actually\n\t\t\t\t\tare friends. But as a matter of fact it happens in friendship as in\n\t\t\t\t\teverything else; people are not healthy merely if they wish to be\n\t\t\t\t\thealthy, so that even if people wish to be friends they are not\n\t\t\t\t\tactually friends already.  A proof of this is that people who have come into this position\n\t\t\t\t\twithout first testing one another are easily set at variance; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthough men are not set at variance easily about things in which they\n\t\t\t\t\thave allowed each other to test them, in cases where they have not,\n\t\t\t\t\twhenever those who are attempting to set then, at variance produce\n\t\t\t\t\tevidence they may be convinced.  At the same time it is manifest that this friendship\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not occur between base people either; for the base and\n\t\t\t\t\tevil-natured man is distrustful towards everybody, because he measures\n\t\t\t\t\tother people by himself. Hence good men are more easily cheated,\n\t\t\t\t\tunless as a result of trial they are distrustful.  But the base prefer the goods\n\t\t\t\t\tof nature to a friend, and none of them love people more than things;\n\t\t\t\t\tand so they are not friends, for the proverbial 'common property as\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween friends' is not realized in this waythe friend is\n\t\t\t\t\tmade an appendage of the things, not the things of the\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends.Therefore the first kind of friendship does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot occur between many men, because it is difficult to test\n\t\t\t\t\tmanyone would have to go and live with each of them. Nor\n\t\t\t\t\tindeed should one exercise choice in the case of a friend in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tway as about a coat; \n\t\t\t\t\talthough in all matters it seems the mark of a sensible man to choose\n\t\t\t\t\tthe better of two things, and if he had been wearing his worse coat\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a long time and had not yet worn his better one, the better one\n\t\t\t\t\tought to be chosenbut you ought not in place of an old\n\t\t\t\t\tfriend to choose one whom you do not know to be a better man.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor a friend is not to be had without trial\n\t\t\t\t\tand is not a matter of a single day, but time is needed; hence the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeck of salt' has come to be proverbial.  At the same time if a friend is really to be\n\t\t\t\t\tyour friend he must be not only good absolutely but also good to you;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a man is good absolutely by being good, but he is a friend by\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing good to another, and he is both good absolutely and a friend\n\t\t\t\t\twhen both these attributes harmonize together, so that what is good\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely is also good for another person; or also he may be not good\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely yet good to another because useful.  But being a friend of many\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople at once is prevented even by the factor of affection, for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot possible for affection to be active in relation to many at\n\t\t\t\t\tonce.These things, therefore, show the\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrectness of the saying that friendship is a thing to be relied on,\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as happiness is a thing that is self-sufficing. And it has been\n\t\t\t\t\trightly said: \"Nature is permanent, but wealth is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot\" although it would be much finer to say 'Friendship'\n\t\t\t\t\tthan 'Nature.' And it is proverbial that\n\t\t\t\t\ttime shows a friend, and also misfortunes more than good fortune. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthen the truth of the saying 'friends' possessions are common\n\t\t\t\t\tproperty' is clear for only friends, instead of the natural goods and\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural evils on which good and bad fortune turn, choose a human being\n\t\t\t\t\trather than the presence of the former and the absence of the\n\t\t\t\t\tlatter; and misfortune shows those\n\t\t\t\t\twho are not friends really but only because of some casual utility.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd both are shown by time; for even the useful friend is not shown\n\t\t\t\t\tquickly, but rather the pleasant oneexcept that one who is\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely pleasant is also not quick to show himself. For men are\n\t\t\t\t\tlike wines and foods; the sweetness of those is quickly evident, but\n\t\t\t\t\twhen lasting longer it is unpleasant and not sweet, and similarly in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case of men. For absolute pleasantness is a thing to be defined by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe End it effects and the time it lasts.  And even the multitude would agree, not in\n\t\t\t\t\tconsequence of results only, but in the same way as in the case of a\n\t\t\t\t\tdrink they call it sweeterfor a drink fails to be pleasant\n\t\t\t\t\tnot because of its result, but because its pleasantness is not\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinuous, although at first it quite takes one in.The primary form of friendship therefore, and the one that causes\n\t\t\t\t\tthe name to be given to the others, is friendship based on goodness\n\t\t\t\t\tand due to the pleasure of goodness, as has been said before. The\n\t\t\t\t\tother friendships occur even among children and animals and wicked\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople: whence the sayings \"Two of an age each other\n\t\t\t\t\tgladden\" and \"Pleasure welds the bad man to the bad.\"And also the bad may be pleasant to each other not as being bad or\n\t\t\t\t\tneutral, but if for instance both are musicians or one\n\t\t\t\t\tfond of music and the other a musician, and in the way in which all\n\t\t\t\t\tmen have some good in them and so fit in with one another.  Further they might be\n\t\t\t\t\tmutually useful and beneficial (not absolutely but for their purpose)\n\t\t\t\t\tnot as being bad or neutral. It is also possible for a bad\n\t\t\t\t\tman to be friends with a good man, for the bad man may be useful to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe good man for his purpose at the time-and the good man to the\n\t\t\t\t\tuncontrolled man for his purpose at the time and to the bad man for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe purpose natural to him; and he will wish his friend what is\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodwish absolutely things absolutely good, and under a\n\t\t\t\t\tgiven condition things good for him, as poverty or disease may be\n\t\t\t\t\tbeneficial: things good for him he will wish for the sake of the\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolute goods, in the way in which he wishes his friend to drink\n\t\t\t\t\tmedicinehe does not wish the action in itself but wishes it\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the given purpose. \n\t\t\t\t\tMoreover a bad man may also be friends with a good one in the ways in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich men not good may be friends with one another: he may be pleasant\n\t\t\t\t\tto him not as being bad but as sharing some common characteristic, for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance if he is musical. Again they may be friends in the way in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich there is some good in everybody (owing to which some men are\n\t\t\t\t\tsociable even though good), or in the way in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich they suit each particular person, for all men have something of\n\t\t\t\t\tgood.These then are three kinds of friendship;\n\t\t\t\t\tand in all of these the term friendship in a manner indicates\n\t\t\t\t\tequality, for even with those who are friends on the ground of\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness the friendship is in a manner based on equality of\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness.But another variety of these kinds is\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship on a basis of superiority, as in that of a god for a\n\t\t\t\t\tman,for that is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent kind of friendship, and generally of a ruler and subject;\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as the principle of justice between them is also different, being\n\t\t\t\t\tone of equality proportionally but not of equality numerically. The friendship of father for son is in this class,\n\t\t\t\t\tand that of benefactor for beneficiary.  And of these sorts of friendship themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are varieties: the friendship of father for son is different\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom that of husband for wifethe former is friendship as\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween ruler and subject, the latter that of benefactor for\n\t\t\t\t\tbeneficiary. And in these varieties either there is no return of\n\t\t\t\t\taffection or it is not returned in a similar way.  For it would be ludicrous if\n\t\t\t\t\tone were to accuse God because he does not return love in the same way\n\t\t\t\t\tas he is loved, or for a subject to make this accusation against a\n\t\t\t\t\truler; for it is the part of a ruler to be loved, not to love, or else\n\t\t\t\t\tto love in another way. \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd the pleasure differs; the pleasure that a man of established\n\t\t\t\t\tposition has in his own property or son and that which one who lacks\n\t\t\t\t\tthem feels in an estate or a child coming to him are not one and the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame.  And in the same way\n\t\t\t\t\talso in the case of those who are friends for utility or for\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasuresome are on a footing of equality, others one of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperiority. Owing to this those who think they are on the former\n\t\t\t\t\tfooting complain if they are not useful and beneficial in a similar\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner; and also in the case of pleasure. This is clear in cases of passionate affection, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is often a cause of combat between the lover and his beloved: the\n\t\t\t\t\tlover does not see that they have not the same reason for their\n\t\t\t\t\taffection. Hence Aenicus has said: \"A loved one so\n\t\t\t\t\twould speak, but not a lover.\" But they think that the reason is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame. There being then, as has been said, three kinds of friendship, based on\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness, utility and pleasantness, these are again divided in two,\n\t\t\t\t\tone set being on a footing of equality and the other on one of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperiority.  Though both\n\t\t\t\t\tsets, therefore, are friendships, only when they are on an equality\n\t\t\t\t\tare the parties friends; for it would be absurd for a man to be a\n\t\t\t\t\tfriend of a child, though he does feel affection for him and receive\n\t\t\t\t\tit from him. In some cases, while the superior partner ought to\n\t\t\t\t\treceive affection, if he gives it he is reproached as loving an\n\t\t\t\t\tunworthy object; for affection is measured by the worth of the friends\n\t\t\t\t\tand by one sort of equality. So in some cases there is properly a\n\t\t\t\t\tdissimilarity of affection because of inferiority of age, in others on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ground of goodness or birth or some other such superiority; it is\n\t\t\t\t\tright for the superior to claim to feel either less affection or none, alike in a friendship\n\t\t\t\t\tof utility and in one of pleasure and one based on goodness.\n\t\t\t\t\t So in cases of\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall degrees of superiority disputes naturally occur (for a small\n\t\t\t\t\tamount is not of importance in some matters, as in weighing timber,\n\t\t\t\t\tthough in gold plate it is; but people judge smallness of amount\n\t\t\t\t\tbadly, since one's own good because of its nearness appears big and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of others because of its remoteness small);  but when there is an excessive\n\t\t\t\t\tamount of difference, then even the parties themselves do not demand\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they ought to be loved in return, or not loved\n\t\t\t\t\talikefor example, if one were claiming a return of love\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom God. It is manifest, therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat men are friends when they are on an equality, but that a return\n\t\t\t\t\tof affection is possible without their being friends.  And it is clear why men seek\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship on a basis of superiority more than that on one of\n\t\t\t\t\tequality; for in the former case they score both affection and a sense\n\t\t\t\t\tof superiority at the same time. Hence with some men the flatterer is\n\t\t\t\t\tmore esteemed than the friend, for he makes the person flattered\n\t\t\t\t\tappear to score both advantages. And this most of all characterizes\n\t\t\t\t\tmen ambitious of honors, since to be admired implies superiority.\n\t\t\t\t\t Some persons grow\n\t\t\t\t\tup by nature affectionate and others ambitious; one who enjoys loving\n\t\t\t\t\tmore than being loved is affectionate, whereas the other enjoys being\n\t\t\t\t\tloved more. So the man who enjoys being admired and loved is a lover\n\t\t\t\t\tof superiority, whereas the other, the affectionate man, loves the\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure of loving. For this he necessarily possesses by the mere\n\t\t\t\t\tactivity of loving; for being loved is an accident, as one can be\n\t\t\t\t\tloved without knowing it, but one cannot love without knowing it.\n\t\t\t\t\t Loving depends,\n\t\t\t\t\tmore than being loved, on the actual feeling, whereas being loved\n\t\t\t\t\tcorresponds with the nature of the object. A sign of this is that a\n\t\t\t\t\tfriend, if both things were not possible, would choose to know the\n\t\t\t\t\tother person rather than to be known by him, as for example women do\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they allow others to adopt their children, and Andromache in the\n\t\t\t\t\ttragedy of Antiphon. Indeed the wish to be known seems to be\n\t\t\t\t\tselfish, and its motive a desire to receive and not to confer some\n\t\t\t\t\tbenefit, whereas to wish to know a person is for the sake of\n\t\t\t\t\tconferring benefit and bestowing affection. For this reason we praise\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who remain constant in affection towards the dead; for they\n\t\t\t\t\tknow, but are not known. It has, then, been stated that there are\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral modes of friendship, and how many modes there are, namely\n\t\t\t\t\tthree, and that receiving affection and having one's affection\n\t\t\t\t\treturned, and friends on an equality and those on a footing of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperiority, are different.But as the term 'friend' is\n\t\t\t\t\tused in a more universal sense as well, as was also said at the\n\t\t\t\t\tbeginning, by those who take in wider considerations (some saying that\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is like is dear, others what is opposite), we must also speak\n\t\t\t\t\tabout these forms of friendship and their relation to the kinds that\n\t\t\t\t\thave been discussed.  As\n\t\t\t\t\tfor likeness, it connects with pleasantness and also with goodness.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the good is simple, whereas the bad is multiform; and also the\n\t\t\t\t\tgood man is always alike and does not change in character, whereas the\n\t\t\t\t\twicked and the foolish are quite different in the evening from what\n\t\t\t\t\tthey were in the morning. \n\t\t\t\t\tHence if wicked men do not hit it off together, they are not friends\n\t\t\t\t\twith one another but they separate; yet an insecure friendship is not\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship at all. So the like is dear to us in this way, because the\n\t\t\t\t\tgood is like. But in a way it is also dear on the score of\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasantness; for to those who are alike the same things are pleasant,\n\t\t\t\t\tand also everything is by nature pleasant to itself. Owing to this relations find one another's\n\t\t\t\t\tvoices and characters and society pleasantest, and so with the lower\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals; and in this way it is possible even for bad men to feel\n\t\t\t\t\taffection for each other: \"But pleasure welds the bad man to the\n\t\t\t\t\tbad.\" But opposite is dear to\n\t\t\t\t\topposite on the score of utility. For the like is useless to itself,\n\t\t\t\t\tand therefore master needs slave and slave master, man and wife need\n\t\t\t\t\tone another; and the opposite is pleasant and desirable as useful, not\n\t\t\t\t\tas contained in the End but as a means to the Endfor when a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing has got what it desires it has arrived at its End, and does not\n\t\t\t\t\tstrive to get its opposite, for example the hot the cold and the wet\n\t\t\t\t\tthe dry.But in a way love of the opposite is also\n\t\t\t\t\tlove of the good. For opposites strive to reach one another through\n\t\t\t\t\tthe middle point, for they strive after each other as tallies, because in that way one middle thing results\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the two.  Hence\n\t\t\t\t\taccidentally love of the good is love of the opposite, but essentially\n\t\t\t\t\tit is love of the middle, for opposites do not strive to reach one\n\t\t\t\t\tanother but the middle. If when people have got too cold they are\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjected to heat, and when they have got too hot to cold, they reach\n\t\t\t\t\ta mean temperature, and similarly in other matters; but without such\n\t\t\t\t\ttreatment they are always in a state of desire, because they are not\n\t\t\t\t\tat the middle points.  But\n\t\t\t\t\ta man in the middle enjoys without passionate desire things by nature\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant, whereas the others enjoy everything that takes them outside\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir natural state.  This\n\t\t\t\t\tkind of relationship, then, exists even between inanimate things; but\n\t\t\t\t\twhen it occurs in the case of living things it becomes affection.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence sometimes people take delight in\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons unlike themselves, the stiff for instance in the witty and the\n\t\t\t\t\tactive in the lazy, for they are brought by one another into the\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle state.  Hence\n\t\t\t\t\taccidentally, as was said, opposites\n\t\t\t\t\tare dear to opposites also on account of the good.It has, then, been said how many kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship there are, and what are the different senses in which\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople are termed friends, and also givers and objects of affection,\n\t\t\t\t\tboth in a manner that makes them actually friends and without being\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends.The question whether one is one's own friend\n\t\t\t\t\tor not involves much consideration. Some think that every man is his\n\t\t\t\t\town best friend, and they use this friendship as a standard by which\n\t\t\t\t\tto judge his friendship for his other friends. On theoretical grounds,\n\t\t\t\t\tand in view of the accepted attributes of friends, self-love and love\n\t\t\t\t\tof others are in some respects opposed but in others manifestly\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar.  For in a way\n\t\t\t\t\tself-love is friendship by analogy, but not absolutely. For being\n\t\t\t\t\tloved and loving involve two separate factors; owing to which a man is\n\t\t\t\t\this own friend rather in the way in which, in the case of the\n\t\t\t\t\tunrestrained and the self-restrained man, we have said how one has those qualities\n\t\t\t\t\tvoluntarily or involuntarilynamely by the parts of one's\n\t\t\t\t\tspirit being related to each other in a certain way; and all such\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters are a similar thing,whether a man can be his own friend or\n\t\t\t\t\tfoe, and whether a man can treat himself unjustly.For all these relations involve\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo separate factors;  in\n\t\t\t\t\tso far then as the spirit is in a manner two, these relations do in a\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner belong to it, but in so far as the two are not separate, they\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not.From the state of friendship for\n\t\t\t\t\toneself are determined the remaining modes of friendship under which\n\t\t\t\t\twe usually study it in our discourses. For a man is thought to be a friend who wishes for\n\t\t\t\t\tsomebody things that are good, or that he believes to be good, not on\n\t\t\t\t\this own account but for the other's sake;  and in another way when a man wishes another's\n\t\t\t\t\texistenceeven though not bestowing goods on him, let alone\n\t\t\t\t\texistencefor that other's sake and not for his own, he\n\t\t\t\t\twould be thought to be in a high degree the friend of that other;\n\t\t\t\t\t and in another way\n\t\t\t\t\ta man is a friend of one whose society he desires merely for the sake\n\t\t\t\t\tof his company and not for something else, as fathers desire their\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren's existence, though they associate with other people. All\n\t\t\t\t\tthese cases conflict with one another;  some men do not think they are loved unless the\n\t\t\t\t\tfriend wishes them this or that particular good, others unless their\n\t\t\t\t\texistence is desired, others unless their society.  Again we shall reckon it\n\t\t\t\t\taffection to grieve with one who grieves not for some ulterior\n\t\t\t\t\tmotiveas for instance slaves in relation to their masters\n\t\t\t\t\tshare their grief because when in grief they are harsh, and not for\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir masters' own sake, as mothers grieve with their children, and\n\t\t\t\t\tbirds that share each other's pain.  For a friend wishes most of all that he might not only\n\t\t\t\t\tfeel pain when his friend is in pain but feel actually the same\n\t\t\t\t\tpainfor example when he is thirsty, share his\n\t\t\t\t\tthirstif this were possible, and if not, as nearly the same\n\t\t\t\t\tas may be.  The same\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple applies also in the case of joy; it is characteristic of a\n\t\t\t\t\tfriend to rejoice for no other reason than because the other is\n\t\t\t\t\trejoicing. Again there are sayings about friendship such\n\t\t\t\t\tas 'Amity is equality' and 'True friends have one spirit.'  All these sayings refer back\n\t\t\t\t\tto the single individual; for that is the way in which the individual\n\t\t\t\t\twishes good to himself, as nobody benefits himself for some ulterior\n\t\t\t\t\tmotive, nor speaks well of himself for such and such a consideration,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause he acted as an individual; for one who displays his affection\n\t\t\t\t\twishes not to be but to be thought affectionate.  And wishing for the other to\n\t\t\t\t\texist, and associating together, and sharing joy and grief, and 'being\n\t\t\t\t\tone spirit' and\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing unable even to live without one another but dying\n\t\t\t\t\ttogetherfor this is the case with the single individual,\n\t\t\t\t\tand he associates with himself in this way,all these\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristics then belong to the man in relation to himself.\n\t\t\t\t\t In a wicked man on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other hand, for instance in one who lacks self-control, there is\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscord, and because of this it is thought to be possible for a man\n\t\t\t\t\tactually to be his own enemy; but as being one and indivisible he is\n\t\t\t\t\tdesirable to himself. \n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the case with a good man and one whose friendship is based on\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness, because assuredly an evil man is not a single individual but\n\t\t\t\t\tmany, and a different person in the same day, and full of caprice.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence a man's affection for himself carries back to love of the\n\t\t\t\t\tgood;for because in a\n\t\t\t\t\tway a man is like himself and a single person and good to himself, in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis way he is dear and desirable to himself. And a man is like that\n\t\t\t\t\tby nature, but a wicked man is contrary to nature.  But a good man does not\n\t\t\t\t\trebuke himself either at the time, like the uncontrolled, nor yet his\n\t\t\t\t\tformer self his later, like the penitent, nor his later self his\n\t\t\t\t\tformer, like the liar (and generally, if it is necessary to distinguish as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sophists do, he is related to himself as 'John Styles' is related\n\t\t\t\t\tto 'good John Styles';\n\t\t\t\t\tfor it is clear that the same amount of 'John Styles' is good as of\n\t\t\t\t\t'good John Styles')because when men blame themselves they\n\t\t\t\t\tare murdering their own personalities, whereas everybody seems to\n\t\t\t\t\thimself good. And he who is absolutely good seeks to be dear even to\n\t\t\t\t\thimself, as has been said, because he has two factors within him which by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature desire to be friendly and which it is impossible to draw\n\t\t\t\t\tasunder.  Therefore in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case of man each individual seems dear to himself, although in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase of other animals it is not so, for example a horse to itself . .\n\t\t\t\t\t. so it is not dear to itself. But neither\n\t\t\t\t\tare children, but only when they have come to possess purposive\n\t\t\t\t\tchoice; for when that point is reached the mind is at variance with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe appetite.  And\n\t\t\t\t\taffection for oneself resembles the affection of relationship: neither\n\t\t\t\t\tconnection is in people's own power to dissolve, but even if the\n\t\t\t\t\tparties quarrel, nevertheless relatives are still relatives and the\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual is still one as long as he lives. From what has been said,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, it is clear how many meanings there are of the term 'affection,'\n\t\t\t\t\tand that all the forms of friendship carry back to the first one.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is relative to our inquiry to consider also the subject of\n\t\t\t\t\tagreement of feeling and kindly feeling; for some people think\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they are the same thing, and others that they cannot exist apart.\n\t\t\t\t\tKindly feeling is neither entirely distinct from friendship nor yet\n\t\t\t\t\tidentical with it.  If\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship is divided into three modes, kindly feeling is not found in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe friendship of utility nor in friendship for pleasure. If A wishes\n\t\t\t\t\tB prosperity because he is useful, the motive of his wish would be not\n\t\t\t\t\tB's interest but his own, whereas it is thought that kindly feeling\n\t\t\t\t\tlike . . . is not for the sake of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe person who feels it himself but for the sake of him for whom he\n\t\t\t\t\tfeels kindly; and if kindly feeling were found in friendship for the\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant, men would feel kindly even towards inanimate objects. So\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is clear that kindly feeling has to do with the friendship\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is based on character.  But it is the mark of one who feels kindly only to wish good,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas it is the mark of the friend also to do the good that he\n\t\t\t\t\twishes; for kindly feeling is the beginning of friendship, as every\n\t\t\t\t\tfriend feels kindly, but not everyone who feels kindly is a friend,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince the kindly man is only as it were making a beginning. Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tkindly feeling is the beginning of friendship, but it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship.For it is thought that\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends agree in feeling, and that those who agree in feeling are\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends.  But the\n\t\t\t\t\tagreement of friendship is not in regard to everything, but to things\n\t\t\t\t\tpracticable for the parties, and the good to all that contributes to\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir association. Nor is it only agreement in thought or in\n\t\t\t\t\tappetition, for it is possible to think and to desire opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tthings,as in the man\n\t\t\t\t\tlacking self-control this discord occurs; if a man agrees with another\n\t\t\t\t\tin purposive choice he does not necessarily agree with him in desire\n\t\t\t\t\talso.  Agreement occurs in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case of good menat all events when bad men purpose and\n\t\t\t\t\tdesire the same things they harm one another.  And it appears that agreement,\n\t\t\t\t\tlike friendship, is not a term of single meaning, but whereas the\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary and natural form of it is good, so that it is not possible for\n\t\t\t\t\tbad men to agree in this way, there is another sort of agreement shown\n\t\t\t\t\teven by bad men when their purpose and desire are for the same\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects.  But it is only\n\t\t\t\t\tproper for them to aim at the same objects in cases when it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible for both to have the things aimed at, since if they aim at a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing of a kind that it is not possible for both to have, they will\n\t\t\t\t\tquarrel; but those who agree in mind do not quarrel.Therefore agreement exists when there is the same purposive choice\n\t\t\t\t\tas to ruling and being rulednot each choosing himself to\n\t\t\t\t\trule but both the same one. Agreement is civic friendship. So much for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subject of agreement in feeling and kindly feeling.The question is raised, why those who have conferred a benefit feel\n\t\t\t\t\tmore affection for those who have received it than those who have\n\t\t\t\t\treceived it feel for those who have conferred it; whereas justice\n\t\t\t\t\tseems to require the opposite.  One might conceive that it occurs for reasons of\n\t\t\t\t\tutility and personal benefit; for benefit is owing to one party and it\n\t\t\t\t\tis the other party's duty to repay it. But really it is not this\n\t\t\t\t\talone;  it is also a law\n\t\t\t\t\tof natureactivity is a more desirable thing, and there is the same relation between effect and\n\t\t\t\t\tactivity as between the parties here: the person benefited is as it\n\t\t\t\t\twere the product of the benefactor. This is why even animals have the\n\t\t\t\t\tphiloprogenitive instinct, which urges them to produce offspring and\n\t\t\t\t\talso to protect the offspring produced.  And in fact fathers love their children more\n\t\t\t\t\tthan they are loved by them (mothers more so than fathers) and these in their turn love\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir children more than their parents, because activity is the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatest good. And mothers love their children more than fathers,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they think that the children are more their work;  for people estimate work by\n\t\t\t\t\tits difficulty, and in the production of a child the mother has more\n\t\t\t\t\tpain.Such may be our decision on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subject of friendship for oneself and of friendship among more\n\t\t\t\t\tthan one.It is thought that what is just is something\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is equal, and also that friendship is based on equality, if there\n\t\t\t\t\tis truth in the saying 'Amity is equality.' And all constitutions are\n\t\t\t\t\tsome species of justice; for they are partnerships, and every\n\t\t\t\t\tpartnership is founded on justice, so that there are as many species\n\t\t\t\t\tof justice and of partnership as there are of friendship, and all\n\t\t\t\t\tthese species border on each other and have their differentia closely\n\t\t\t\t\trelated.  But since the\n\t\t\t\t\trelations of soul and body, craftsman and tool, and master and slave\n\t\t\t\t\tare similar, between the two terms of each of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese pairs there is no partnership;for they are not two, but the former is one and the\n\t\t\t\t\tlatter a part of that one, not one itself; nor is the good divisible\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween them, but that of both belongs to the one for whose sake they\n\t\t\t\t\texist. For the body is the soul's tool born with it, a slave is as it\n\t\t\t\t\twere a member or tool of his master, a tool is a sort of inanimate\n\t\t\t\t\tslave.The other partnerships are a constituent\n\t\t\t\t\tpart of the partnerships of the statefor example that of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe members of a brotherhood or a priesthood, or with business\n\t\t\t\t\tpartnerships. All forms of constitution exist together in the\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold, both the correct forms and the deviations (for the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is found in constitutions as in the case of musical modes) paternal authority being royal, the\n\t\t\t\t\trelationship of man and wife aristocratic, that of brothers a\n\t\t\t\t\trepublic, while the deviation-forms of these are tyranny, oligarchy\n\t\t\t\t\tand democracy; and there are therefore as many varieties of\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice.And since there are two sorts of equality,\n\t\t\t\t\tnumerical and proportional, there will also be various species of\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice and of partnership and friendship. The partnership of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemocracy is based on numerical equality, and so is the friendship of\n\t\t\t\t\tcomrades, as it is measured by the same standard; whereas the\n\t\t\t\t\taristocratic partnership (which is the best) and the royal are\n\t\t\t\t\tproportional, for it is just for superior and inferior to have not the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame share but proportional shares;  and similarly also the friendship of father and son,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the same way in partnerships. Specified sorts of friendship are therefore the friendship of\n\t\t\t\t\trelatives, that of comrades, that of partners and what is termed civic\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship. Really friendship of relatives has more than one species,\n\t\t\t\t\tone as between brothers, another as of father and son: it may be proportional, for example\n\t\t\t\t\tpaternal friendship, or based on number, for example the friendship of\n\t\t\t\t\tbrothersfor this is near the friendship of comrades, as in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis also they claim privileges of seniority.  Civic friendship on the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand is constituted in the fullest degree on the principle of utility,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor it seems to be the individual's lack of self-sufficiency that\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes these unions permanentsince they would have been\n\t\t\t\t\tformed in any case merely for the sake of society. Only civic\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship and the deviation from it are not merely friendships but\n\t\t\t\t\talso partnerships on a friendly footing; the others are on a basis of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperiority.  The justice\n\t\t\t\t\tthat underlies a friendship of utility is in the highest degree just,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause this is the civic principle of justice. The coming together of\n\t\t\t\t\ta saw with the craft that uses it is on different linesit\n\t\t\t\t\tis not for the sake of some common object, for saw and craft are like\n\t\t\t\t\tinstrument and spirit, but for the sake of the man who employs them.\n\t\t\t\t\t It does indeed\n\t\t\t\t\tcome about that even the tool itself receives attention which it\n\t\t\t\t\tdeserves with a view to its work, since it exists for the sake of its\n\t\t\t\t\twork, and the essential nature of a gimlet is twofold, the more\n\t\t\t\t\timportant half being its activity, boring. And the body and the slave are\n\t\t\t\t\tin the class of tool, as has been said before.\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore to seek the proper way of\n\t\t\t\t\tassociating with a friend is to seek for a particular kind of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\tIn fact the whole of justice in general is in relation to a friend,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor what is just is just for certain persons; and persons who are\n\t\t\t\t\tpartners, and a friend is a partner, either in one's family or in one's life. For man is not only a\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical but also a house-holding animal, and does not, like the\n\t\t\t\t\tother animals, couple occasionally and with any chance female or male,\n\t\t\t\t\t but man is in a\n\t\t\t\t\tspecial way not a solitary but a gregarious animal, associating with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe persons with whom he has a natural kinship; accordingly there\n\t\t\t\t\twould be partnership; and justice of a sort, even if there were no\n\t\t\t\t\tstate.  And a household\n\t\t\t\t\tis a sort of friendshipor rather the relationships of\n\t\t\t\t\tmaster and slave is that of craft and tools, and of spirit and body,\n\t\t\t\t\tand such relationships are not friendships or forms of justice but\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething analogous, just as health is not justice but\n\t\t\t\t\tanalogous to it.  But the\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship of man and wife is one of utility, a partnership; that of\n\t\t\t\t\tfather and son is the same as that between god and man and between\n\t\t\t\t\tbenefactor and beneficiary, and generally between natural ruler and\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural subject.  That\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween brothers is principally the friendship of comrades, as being\n\t\t\t\t\ton a footing of equality for these are the words of men seeking equality.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence in the household are first found the\n\t\t\t\t\torigins and springs of friendship, of political organization and of\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice.And since there are three sorts of\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship, based on goodness, on utility and on pleasure, and two\n\t\t\t\t\tvarieties of each sort (for each of them is either on a basis of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperiority or of equality), and what is just in relation to them is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear from our discussions, in the variety based on superiority the\n\t\t\t\t\tproportionate claims are not on the same lines, but the superior party\n\t\t\t\t\tclaims by inverse proportionthe contribution of the\n\t\t\t\t\tinferior to stand in the same ratio to his own as he himself stands in\n\t\t\t\t\tto the inferior, his attitude being that of ruler to subject;\n\t\t\t\t\t or if not that,\n\t\t\t\t\tat all events he claims a numerically equal share (for in fact it\n\t\t\t\t\thappens in this way in other associations toosometimes the\n\t\t\t\t\tshares are numerically equal, sometimes proportionally: if the parties\n\t\t\t\t\tcontributed a numerically equal sum of money, they also take a share\n\t\t\t\t\tequal by numerical equality, if an unequal sum, a share proportionally\n\t\t\t\t\tequal). The inferior party on the contrary inverts the proportion, and\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes a diagonal conjunction;  but it would seem that in this way the superior\n\t\t\t\t\tcomes off worse, and the friendship or partnership is a charitable\n\t\t\t\t\tservice. Therefore equality must be restored and\n\t\t\t\t\tproportion secured by some other means;  and this means is honor,which belongs by nature to a\n\t\t\t\t\truler and god in relation to a subject. But the profit must be made equal to the\n\t\t\t\t\thonor.Friendship on a footing of equality is civic\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship. Civic friendship is, it is true, based on utility, and\n\t\t\t\t\tfellow-citizens are one another's friends in the same way as different\n\t\t\t\t\tcities are, and \" no\n\t\t\t\t\tlonger knoweth ,\" nor similarly do citizens know one\n\t\t\t\t\tanother, when they are not useful to one another; their friendship is\n\t\t\t\t\ta ready-money transaction.\n\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless there is present here a ruling factor and a\n\t\t\t\t\trulednot a natural ruler or a royal one, but one that rules\n\t\t\t\t\tin his turn, and not for the purpose of conferring benefit, as God\n\t\t\t\t\trules, but in order that he may have an equal share of the benefit and\n\t\t\t\t\tof the burden. Therefore civic friendship aims at being on a footing\n\t\t\t\t\tof equality.  But useful\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship is of two kinds, the merely legal and the moral. Civic\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship looks to equality and to the object, as buyers and sellers\n\t\t\t\t\tdohence the saying .When,\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, it is based on a definite agreement, this is civic and\n\t\t\t\t\tlegal friendship; but when they trust each other for repayment, it\n\t\t\t\t\ttends to be moral friendship, that of comrades. Hence this is the kind\n\t\t\t\t\tof friendship in which recriminations most occur, the reason being\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is contrary to nature; for friendship based on utility and\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship based on goodness are different, but these people wish to\n\t\t\t\t\thave it both ways at oncethey associate together for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsake of utility but make it out to be a moral friendship as between\n\t\t\t\t\tgood men, and so represent it as not merely legal,\n\t\t\t\t\tpretending that it is a matter of trust.For in general,\n\t\t\t\t\tof the three kinds of friendship, it is in useful friendship that most\n\t\t\t\t\trecriminations occur (for goodness is not given to recrimination, and\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant friends having got and given their share break it off, but\n\t\t\t\t\tuseful friends do not dissolve the association at once, if their\n\t\t\t\t\tintercourse is on comradely and not merely legal lines);  nevertheless the legal sort\n\t\t\t\t\tof useful friendship is not given to recrimination. The legal method\n\t\t\t\t\tof discharging the obligation is a matter of money, for that serves as\n\t\t\t\t\ta measure of equality; but the moral method is voluntary. Hence in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome places there is a law prohibiting friendly associates of this\n\t\t\t\t\tsort from actions as to their voluntary contractsrightly,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince it is not natural for good men to go to law, and these men make their contracts as good men\n\t\t\t\t\tand as dealing with trustworthy people.  And in fact in this sort of friendship the\n\t\t\t\t\trecriminations are doubtful on both sideswhat line of\n\t\t\t\t\taccusation each party will take, inasmuch as their confidence was of a\n\t\t\t\t\tmoral kind and not merely legal.Indeed it is a\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion in which of two ways one ought to judge what is a just\n\t\t\t\t\treturn, whether by looking at the actual amount or quality of the\n\t\t\t\t\tservice rendered, or by its amount or quality for the recipient; for\n\t\t\t\t\tit may be as Theognis says, and also the result may be opposite, as in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe saying  'This is sport to you but\n\t\t\t\t\tdeath to me.' Hence recriminations, as has been said; for one party claims recompense\n\t\t\t\t\tas having rendered a great service, because he did it for his friend\n\t\t\t\t\tin need, or saying something else of the sort as to how much it was\n\t\t\t\t\tworth in relation to the benefit given to the recipient and not what\n\t\t\t\t\tit was to himself, while the other party on the contrary speaks of how\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch it was to the donor and not bow much it was to himself.\n\t\t\t\t\t And at other\n\t\t\t\t\ttimes the position is reversed: the one says how little he got out of\n\t\t\t\t\tit, the other how much the service was worth to himfor\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance, if by taking a risk he did the other a shilling's worth of\n\t\t\t\t\tbenefit, the one talks about the amount of the risk and the other\n\t\t\t\t\tabout the amount of the cash; just as in the repayment of a money\n\t\t\t\t\tloan, for there too the dispute turns on thisone claims to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe repaid the value that the money had when lent,the other claims to\n\t\t\t\t\trepay it at the present value, unless they have put a proviso in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontract.Civic friendship, then, looks\n\t\t\t\t\tat the agreement and to the thing, but moral friendship at the\n\t\t\t\t\tintention; hence the latter is more justit is friendly\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice.  The cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tconflict is that moral friendship is nobler but friendship of utility\n\t\t\t\t\tmore necessary; and men begin as being moral friends and friends on\n\t\t\t\t\tgrounds of goodness, but when some private interest comes into\n\t\t\t\t\tcollision it becomes clear that really they were different. For most\n\t\t\t\t\tmen pursue what is fine only when they have a good margin in hand, and\n\t\t\t\t\tso with the finer sort of friendship too. Hence it is clear how these\n\t\t\t\t\tcases must be decided. If they are moral friends, we must consider if\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir intentions are equal, and nothing else must be claimed by either\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the other; and if they are friends on the ground of utility or\n\t\t\t\t\tcivic friends, we must consider what form of agreement would have been\n\t\t\t\t\tprofitable for them.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut if one says they are friends on one footing and the other on\n\t\t\t\t\tanother, it is not honorable, when an active return is due, merely to\n\t\t\t\t\tmake fine speeches, and similarly also in the other case; but since they did not provide for this in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontract, on the ground that it was a moral friendship, somebody must\n\t\t\t\t\tjudge, and neither party must cheat by pretending; so that each must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe content with his luck.  But it is clear that moral friendship is a matter of intention,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince even if a man after having received great benefits owing to\n\t\t\t\t\tinability did not repay them, but only repaid as much as he was able,\n\t\t\t\t\the acts honorably; for even God is content with getting sacrifices in\n\t\t\t\t\taccordance with our ability.  But a seller will not be satisfied if a man says he\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot pay more, nor will one who has made a loan.In friendships not based on direct reciprocity\n\t\t\t\t\tmany causes of recrimination occur, and it is not easy to see what is\n\t\t\t\t\tjust; for it is difficult to measure by one given thing relations that\n\t\t\t\t\tare not directly reciprocal.  This is how it happens in love affairs, since in\n\t\t\t\t\tthem one party pursues the other as a pleasant person to live with,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut sometimes the other the one as useful, and when the lover ceases\n\t\t\t\t\tto love,he having changed\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other changes, and then they calculate the quid pro quo, and\n\t\t\t\t\tquarrel as  and\n\t\t\t\t\tPammenes used, and as teacher\n\t\t\t\t\tand pupil do in general (for knowledge and money have no common\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasure), and as Herodicus\n\t\t\t\t\tthe doctor did with the patient who offered to pay his fee with a\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscount, and as the harpist and the king fell out.  The king associated with the\n\t\t\t\t\tharpist as pleasant and the harpist with the king as useful; but the\n\t\t\t\t\tking, when the time came for him to pay, made out that he was himself\n\t\t\t\t\tof the pleasant sort, and said that just as the harpist had given him\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure by his singing, so he had given the harpist pleasure by his\n\t\t\t\t\tpromises to him. Nevertheless here too it is clear how we must\n\t\t\t\t\tdecide: here too we must measure by one standard, but by a ratio, not\n\t\t\t\t\ta number. For we must measure by proportion, as also the civic\n\t\t\t\t\tpartnership is measured. For how is a shoemaker to be partner with a\n\t\t\t\t\tfarmer unless their products are equalized by proportion?  Therefore the measure for\n\t\t\t\t\tpartnerships not directly reciprocal is proportionfor\n\t\t\t\t\texample if one party complains that he has given wisdom and the other\n\t\t\t\t\tsays he has given the former money, what is the ratio of wisdom to\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing rich? and then, what is the amount given for each? for if one\n\t\t\t\t\tparty has given half of the smaller amount but the other not even a\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall fraction of the larger, it is clear that the latter is cheating.\n\t\t\t\t\t But here too\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is a dispute at the outset, if one says that they came together\n\t\t\t\t\ton grounds of utility and the other denies it and says it was on the\n\t\t\t\t\tbasis of some other kind of friendship. About the good friend and the friend on the basis of goodness, we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust consider whether one ought to render useful services and\n\t\t\t\t\tassistance to him or to the friend who is able to make an equal\n\t\t\t\t\treturn. This is the same problem as whether it is more one's duty to\n\t\t\t\t\tbenefit a friend or a virtuous man.  If a man is a friend and virtuous, perhaps it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tover-difficult, provided one does not exaggerate the one factor and\n\t\t\t\t\tunderrate the other, benefiting him greatly as friend but only\n\t\t\t\t\tslightly as good. But in other cases many problems arise, for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance, if A was a friend but is going not to be and B is going to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe but is not now, or if A became one but is not one now and B is one\n\t\t\t\t\tnow but was not and is going not to be. But the former problem is more difficult.  For possibly there is something in the lines\n\t\t\t\t\tof Euripides:  and it is not one's duty to give everything to one's father,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut there are other things that one ought to give to one's mother,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough the father is the superior; for even to Zeus not all the\n\t\t\t\t\tsacrifices are offered, nor does he have all the honors but some\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular ones. \n\t\t\t\t\tPerhaps, therefore, there are some services that ought to be rendered\n\t\t\t\t\tto the useful friend and others to the good friend: for instance, if a\n\t\t\t\t\tfriend gives you food and necessaries you are not therefore bound to\n\t\t\t\t\tgive him your society, and accordingly also you are not bound to\n\t\t\t\t\trender to the friend to whom you give your society the things that you\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not get from him but from the useful friend; but those who by so\n\t\t\t\t\tdoing wrongly give everything to one whom they love are\n\t\t\t\t\tgood-for-nothing people.And\n\t\t\t\t\tthe defining marks of friendship stated in the discourses all belong\n\t\t\t\t\tto friendship in some sense, but not to the same kind of friendship.\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a mark of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe useful friend that one wishes the things good for him, and so of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe benefactor, and in fact a friend of any sort (for this definition\n\t\t\t\t\tof friendship is not distinctive); of another friend, that one wishes\n\t\t\t\t\this existence, of another that one wishes his society; of the friend\n\t\t\t\t\ton the ground of pleasure, that one shares his grief and his joy.\n\t\t\t\t\t All these defining\n\t\t\t\t\tmarks are predicated in the case of some friendship, but none of them\n\t\t\t\t\twith reference to friendship as a single thing. Hence there are many\n\t\t\t\t\tof them, and each is thought to belong to friendship as one, though it\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not: for instance, the desire for the friend's\n\t\t\t\t\texistencefor the superior friend and benefactor wishes\n\t\t\t\t\texistence to belong to his own workand to him who gave one\n\t\t\t\t\texistence it is one's duty to give existence in\n\t\t\t\t\treturn; but he wishes the society not of this friend but of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant one.Friends in some cases wrong each other,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they love things more, not the possessor of them, and are\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends of the possessor too on this account (just as a man chose his\n\t\t\t\t\twine because it was sweet and chose his wealth because it was useful),\n\t\t\t\t\tfor he is more useful. Hence naturally he is\n\t\t\t\t\tannoyed, just as if they had preferred his possessions to himself as\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing inferior; and they complain, for now they look to find in him\n\t\t\t\t\tthe good man, having previously looked for the pleasant or the useful\n\t\t\t\t\tman. We must also consider\n\t\t\t\t\tself-sufficiency and friendship, and the interrelationship of their\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentialities. For one may raise the question whether if a person be\n\t\t\t\t\tself-sufficing in every respect he will have a friend, or whether on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe contrary a friend is sought for in need, and the good man will be\n\t\t\t\t\tmost self-sufficing. If the life that is combined with goodness is\n\t\t\t\t\thappy, what need would there be of a friend? For it does not belong to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe self-sufficing man to need either useful friends or friends to\n\t\t\t\t\tamuse him and society, for he is sufficient society for himself.\n\t\t\t\t\t This is most\n\t\t\t\t\tmanifest in the case of God; for it is clear that as he needs nothing\n\t\t\t\t\tmore he will not need a friend, and that supposing he has no need of\n\t\t\t\t\tone he will not have one. Consequently the happiest human being also\n\t\t\t\t\twill very little need a friend, except in so far as to be\n\t\t\t\t\tself-sufficing is impossible.  Of necessity, therefore, he who lives the best life\n\t\t\t\t\twill have fewest friends, and they will constantly become fewer, and\n\t\t\t\t\the will not be eager to have friends but will think lightly not only\n\t\t\t\t\tof useful friends but also of those desirable for society. But\n\t\t\t\t\tassuredly even his case would seem to show that a friend is not for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of utility or benefit but that one loved on account of\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness is the only real friend.  For when we are not in need of something, then we all\n\t\t\t\t\tseek people to share our enjoyments, and beneficiaries rather than\n\t\t\t\t\tbenefactors;and we\n\t\t\t\t\tcan judge them better when we are self-sufficing than when in need,\n\t\t\t\t\tand we most need friends who are worthy of our society.But about this question we must consider whether perhaps, although\n\t\t\t\t\tthe view stated is partly sound, in part the truth escapes us because\n\t\t\t\t\tof the comparison. The matter is clear if we ascertain what life\n\t\t\t\t\tin the active sense and as an End is.  It is manifest that life is perception and\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge, and that consequently social life is perception and\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge in common. But perception and knowledge themselves are the\n\t\t\t\t\tthing most desirable for each individually (and it is owing to this\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the appetition for life is implanted by nature in all, for living\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be deemed a mode of knowing).  If therefore one were to abstract and posit absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge and its negation (though this, it is true, is obscure in the\n\t\t\t\t\targument as we have written it, but it may be observed in experience),\n\t\t\t\t\tthere would be no difference between absolute knowledge and another\n\t\t\t\t\tperson's knowing instead of oneself; but that is like another person's\n\t\t\t\t\tliving instead of oneself, whereas perceiving and knowing oneself is\n\t\t\t\t\treasonably more desirable. For two things must be taken into\n\t\t\t\t\tconsideration together, that life is desirable and that good is\n\t\t\t\t\tdesirable, and as a consequence that it is desirable for ourselves to\n\t\t\t\t\tpossess a nature of that quality.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf, therefore, of the pair of corresponding series of this kind one is always in the\n\t\t\t\t\tclass of the desirable, and the known and the perceived are generally\n\t\t\t\t\tspeaking constituted by their participation in the 'determined'\n\t\t\t\t\tnature, so that to wish to perceive oneself is to wish oneself to be\n\t\t\t\t\tof a certain character,since, then, we are not each of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese things in ourselves but only by participating in these faculties\n\t\t\t\t\tin the process of perceiving or knowing (for when perceiving one\n\t\t\t\t\tbecomes perceived by means of what one previously perceives, in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner and in the respect in which one perceives it, and when knowing\n\t\t\t\t\tone becomes known)hence owing to this one wishes always to\n\t\t\t\t\tlive because one wishes always to know; and this is because one wishes\n\t\t\t\t\tto be oneself the object known.  To choose to live in the society of others might,\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, from a certain point of view seem foolish (first in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase of the things common to the other animals also, for instance\n\t\t\t\t\teating together or drinking together, for what difference does it make\n\t\t\t\t\twhether these things take place when we are near together or apart, if\n\t\t\t\t\tyou take away speech? but even to share in speech that is merely\n\t\t\t\t\tcasual is a thing indifferent, and also neither to impart nor to\n\t\t\t\t\treceive information is possible for friends who are self-sufficing,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince receiving information implies a deficiency in oneself and\n\t\t\t\t\timparting it a deficiency in one's friend, and likeness is\n\t\t\t\t\tfriendship) but nevertheless it surely seems that we all find it\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasanter to share good things with our friends,as far as these fall to each,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the best that each can but among these, it falls to one to share\n\t\t\t\t\tbodily pleasure, to another artistic study, to another\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy; and so it is pleasanter to be with one's friend\n\t\t\t\t\t(whence the saying 'Distant friends a burden are'), so that they must not be separated when\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is taking place. Hence also love seems to resemble friendship,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the lover is eager to share the life of the loved one, although\n\t\t\t\t\tnot in the most proper way but in a sensuous manner.Therefore the argument in raising the question asserts the former\n\t\t\t\t\tposition, but the facts\n\t\t\t\t\tof experience are obviously on the latter lines, so that it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the raiser of the question in a way misleads us.  We must therefore examine\n\t\t\t\t\tthe truth from the following consideration: 'friend' really denotes,\n\t\t\t\t\tin the language of the proverb,'another Hercules'another self; but the\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristics are scattered, and it is difficult for all to be\n\t\t\t\t\trealized in the case of one person; though by nature a friend is what\n\t\t\t\t\tis most akin, yet one resembles his friend in body and another in\n\t\t\t\t\tspirit, and one in one part of the body or spirit, another in another.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut still none the less a friend really means as it were a separate\n\t\t\t\t\tself.  To perceive and\n\t\t\t\t\tto know a friend, therefore, is necessarily in a manner to perceive\n\t\t\t\t\tand in a manner to know oneself. Consequently to share even vulgar\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasures and ordinary life with a friend is naturally pleasant (for\n\t\t\t\t\tit always involves our simultaneously perceiving the friend), but more\n\t\t\t\t\tso to share the more divine pleasures; the reason of which is that it\n\t\t\t\t\tis always more pleasant to behold oneself enjoying the superior good,\n\t\t\t\t\tand this is sometimes a passive, sometimes an\n\t\t\t\t\tactive experience, sometimes something else. But if it is pleasant to\n\t\t\t\t\tlive well oneself and for one's friend also to live well, and if\n\t\t\t\t\tliving together involves working together, surely their partnership\n\t\t\t\t\twill be pre-eminently in things included in the End. Hence we should\n\t\t\t\t\tstudy together, and feast togethernot on the pleasures of\n\t\t\t\t\tfood and the necessary pleasures (for such partnerships do not seem to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe real social intercourse but mere enjoyment),  but each really wishes to\n\t\t\t\t\tshare with his friends the End that he is capable of attaining, or\n\t\t\t\t\tfailing this, men choose most of all to benefit their friends and to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe benefited by them. It is therefore manifest that to live together\n\t\t\t\t\tis actually a duty, and that all people wish it very much, and that\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is most the case with the man that is the happiest and best. But\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the contrary appeared to be the conclusion of the argument was also reasonable, the statement being true.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the solution is on the line of the comparison, the correspondence being true;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the fact that God is not of such a nature as to need a friend\n\t\t\t\t\tpostulates that man, who is like God, also does not need one.\n\t\t\t\t\t Yet according to\n\t\t\t\t\tthis argument the virtuous man will not think of anything; for God's\n\t\t\t\t\tperfection does not permit of this, but he is too perfect to think of\n\t\t\t\t\tanything else beside himself. And the reason is that for us well-being\n\t\t\t\t\thas reference to something other than ourselves, but in his case he is\n\t\t\t\t\thimself his own well-being. As to seeking\n\t\t\t\t\tfor ourselves and praying for many friends, and at the same time\n\t\t\t\t\tsaying that one who has many friends has no friend, both statements\n\t\t\t\t\tare correct. For if it is possible to live with and share the\n\t\t\t\t\tperceptions of many at once, it is most desirable for them to be the\n\t\t\t\t\tlargest possible number; but as that is very difficult, active\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunity of perception must of necessity be in a smaller circle,\n\t\t\t\t\t so that it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tonly difficult to acquire many friends (for probation is needed), but\n\t\t\t\t\talso to use them when one has got them.One for whom we feel affection we sometimes wish to prosper in\n\t\t\t\t\tabsence from us, but sometimes to share the same experiences. And to\n\t\t\t\t\twish to be together is a mark of friendship, for if it is possible to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe together and to prosper all choose this; but if it is not possible\n\t\t\t\t\tto prosper together, then we choose as the mother of Heracles perhaps\n\t\t\t\t\twould have chosen for her son, to be a god rather than to be with her\n\t\t\t\t\tbut in service to Eurystheus.  For men would say things like the jest which the\n\t\t\t\t\tSpartan made when somebody told him to invoke the Dioscuri in a\n\t\t\t\t\tstorm.It seems\n\t\t\t\t\tto be characteristic of one who feels affection for another to debar\n\t\t\t\t\thim from sharing his troubles, and of the person for whom affection is\n\t\t\t\t\tfelt to wish to share them. Both these things happen reasonably; for\n\t\t\t\t\tto a friend nothing ought to give so much pain as his friend gives\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure, yet it is felt that he ought not to choose his own interest.\n\t\t\t\t\t Hence people\n\t\t\t\t\thinder their friends from sharing their sorrows; they are content to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe in trouble by themselves, in order that they\n\t\t\t\t\tmay not appear from selfish considerations actually to choose the joy\n\t\t\t\t\tof their friend's grief and furthermore to find it a relief not to\n\t\t\t\t\tbear their misfortunes alone.  And as both well-being and companionship are\n\t\t\t\t\tdesirable, it is clear that companionship combined with even a lesser\n\t\t\t\t\tgood is in a way more desirable than separation with a greater good.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut as it is not clear how much value companionship has, at this point\n\t\t\t\t\tmen differ, and some think it is friendly to share everything in\n\t\t\t\t\tcompany, and say, for instance, that it is pleasanter to dine with\n\t\t\t\t\tcompany though having the same food; others wish to share only in\n\t\t\t\t\twell-being, because, they say, if one supposes extreme cases, people\n\t\t\t\t\texperiencing great adversity in company or great prosperity separately\n\t\t\t\t\tare on a par.  And it is\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch the same as this in regard to misfortunes also; sometimes we wish\n\t\t\t\t\tour friends to be absent, and do not want to give them pain when their\n\t\t\t\t\tpresence is not going to do any good, but at other times for them to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe present is most pleasant. And the reason of this contrariety is\n\t\t\t\t\tvery easily explained; it comes about because of the things stated\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore, and\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause to behold a friend in pain or in a bad state is a thing we\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely shun, as we shun it in our own case, but to see a friend is\n\t\t\t\t\tas pleasant as anything can be, for the reason stated, and indeed to see him ill if\n\t\t\t\t\tone is ill oneself;  so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat whichever of these is more pleasant, it sways the balance of\n\t\t\t\t\twishing him to be present or not.And it fits in that the former occurs in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tinferior people, and for the same reason; they are most eager for\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir friends not to prosper and not to be absent if they themselves\n\t\t\t\t\thave to suffer adversity. Hence sometimes suicides kill those whom\n\t\t\t\t\tthey love with themselves, as they think that they feel their own\n\t\t\t\t\tmisfortune more if their loved ones are to survive; just as, if a man in trouble had the memory\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he had once been prosperous, he would be more conscious of his\n\t\t\t\t\ttrouble than if he thought that he had always done badly."}}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "8", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "1246a"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "26"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "1.1"}, {"@unit": "para", "@ed": "P"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "1.2"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "1.3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1246b"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "1.4"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "1.5"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "1.6"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "1.7"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.1"}, {"@unit": "para", "@ed": "P"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1247a"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.2"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.3"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.4"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.5"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.6"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.7"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.8"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.9"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1247b"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "para", "@ed": "P"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.10"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.11"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.12"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.13"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.14"}, {"@unit": "para", "@ed": "P"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.15"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.16"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1248a"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.17"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.18"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.19"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.20"}, {"@unit": "para", "@ed": "P"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.21"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.22"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.23"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1248b"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "2.24"}, {"@unit": "para", "@ed": "P"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.1"}, {"@unit": "para", "@ed": "P"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.2"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.3"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.4"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.5"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.6"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.7"}, {"@unit": "para", "@ed": "P"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1249a"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.8"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.9"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.10"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.11"}, {"@unit": "para", "@ed": "P"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.12"}, {"@unit": "para", "@ed": "P"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1249b"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.13"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.14"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.15"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.16"}, {"@unit": "line", "@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "Loeb chap", "@ed": "P", "@n": "3.17"}, {"@unit": "para", "@ed": "P"}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "Rackham", "title": "J.

Or is it manifest that also if there is goodness in the\n\t\t\t\t\tirrational part but folly in the reason, goodness and folly are\n\t\t\t\t\ttransformed in another way? so that it will be possible to use justice\n\t\t\t\t\tunjustly and badly, and wisdom unwisely; and therefore the opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tuses also will be possible.For it is strange if whereas when wickedness at any time arises in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe irrational part it will pervert the goodness in the rational and\n\t\t\t\t\tcause it to be ignorant, yet goodness in the irrational part when\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is folly in the rational should not convert the folly and make\n\t\t\t\t\tit form wise and proper judgements, and again wisdom in the rational\n\t\t\t\t\tpart should not make profligacy in the irrational act\n\t\t\t\t\ttemperatelywhich seems to be what self-control essentially\n\t\t\t\t\tis. So that there will actually be wise action arising from folly.\n\t\t\t\t\t But these\n\t\t\t\t\tconsequences are absurd, especially that of using wisdom wisely as a\n\t\t\t\t\tresult of folly; for that is a thing which we certainly do not see in\n\t\t\t\t\tother casesfor instance profligacy perverts one's medical\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge or scholarship, but it does not pervert one's ignorance if\n\t\t\t\t\tit be opposed to it, because it does not contain superiority, but\n\t\t\t\t\trather it is goodness in general that stands in this relation to\n\t\t\t\t\tbadness; for example, the just man is capable of all that the unjust\n\t\t\t\t\tman is, and in general inability is contained in ability.  So that it is clear that men\n\t\t\t\t\tare wise and good simultaneously, and that the states of character\n\t\t\t\t\tabove described belong to a different person, and the Socratic dictum\n\t\t\t\t\t'Nothing is mightier than wisdom,' is right. But in that by 'wisdom'\n\t\t\t\t\the meant 'knowledge,' he was wrong; for wisdom is a form of goodness,\n\t\t\t\t\tand is not scientific knowledge but another kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tcognition.But wisdom is not the only thing which\n\t\t\t\t\tacting in accordance with goodness causes welfare, but we also speak of the fortunate as faring well, which\n\t\t\t\t\timplies that good fortune also engenders welfare in the same way as\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge does; we must therefore consider whether one man is\n\t\t\t\t\tfortunate and another unfortunate by nature or not, and how it stands\n\t\t\t\t\twith these matters.  For\n\t\t\t\t\tthat some men are fortunate we see, since many though foolish succeed\n\t\t\t\t\tin things in which luck is paramount, and some even in things which\n\t\t\t\t\tinvolve skill although also containing a large element of\n\t\t\t\t\tluckfor example strategy and navigation.  Are, then, these men fortunate\n\t\t\t\t\tas a result of a certain state of character, or are they enabled to\n\t\t\t\t\tachieve fortunate results not by reason of a certain quality in\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves? As it is, people think the latter, holding that some men\n\t\t\t\t\tare successful by natural causes; but nature makes men of a certain\n\t\t\t\t\tquality, and the fortunate and unfortunate are different even from\n\t\t\t\t\tbirth, in the same way as some men are blue-eyed and others black-eyed\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause a particular part of them is of a particular quality.\n\t\t\t\t\t For it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they do not succeed by means of wisdom, because wisdom is not\n\t\t\t\t\tirrational but can give reason why it acts as it does, whereas they\n\t\t\t\t\tcould not say why they succeedfor that would be science;\n\t\t\t\t\t and moreover it is\n\t\t\t\t\tmanifest that they succeed in spite of being unwisenot\n\t\t\t\t\tunwise about other matters (for that would not be anything strange,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example Hippocrates was skilled in geometry but was thought to be stupid and\n\t\t\t\t\tunwise in other matters, and it is said that on a voyage owing to\n\t\t\t\t\tfoolishness he lost a great deal of money,taken from him by the collectors of the\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo-per-cent duty at ), but even though they are unwise about the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters in which they are fortunate.  For in navigation it is not the cleverest who\n\t\t\t\t\tare fortunate, but (just as in throwing dice one man throws a blank\n\t\t\t\t\tand another a six) a man is fortunate according as things were\n\t\t\t\t\tarranged by nature. Or is it\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause he is loved by God, as the phrase goes, and because success is\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething from outside? as for instance a badly built ship often gets\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough a voyage better, though not owing to itself, but because it\n\t\t\t\t\thas a good man at the helm.  But on this showing the fortunate man has the deity as steersman.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut it is strange that a god or deity should love a man of this sort,\n\t\t\t\t\tand not the best and most prudent. If, then, the success of the lucky\n\t\t\t\t\tmust necessarily be due to either nature or intellect or some\n\t\t\t\t\tguardianship, and of these three causes two are ruled out, those who\n\t\t\t\t\tare fortunate will be so by nature.  But again, nature of course is the cause of a thing\n\t\t\t\t\tthat happens either always or generally in the same way, whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tfortune is the opposite. If, then, unexpected achievement seems a\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter of fortune, but, if a man is fortunate owing to fortune, it\n\t\t\t\t\twould seem that the cause is not of such a sort as to produce the same\n\t\t\t\t\tresult always or generally further, if a man's succeeding or not\n\t\t\t\t\tsucceeding is due to his being of a certain sort, as a man does not\n\t\t\t\t\tsee clearly because he has blue eyes, not fortune but nature is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause; therefore he is not a man who has good fortune but one who has\n\t\t\t\t\tas it were a good nature. Hence we should have to say that the people\n\t\t\t\t\twe call fortunate are so not by reason of fortune; therefore they are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot fortunate, for the fortunate are those for\n\t\t\t\t\twhom good fortune is a cause of good things.But if so, shall we say that there is no such thing as\n\t\t\t\t\tfortune at all, or that it does exist but is not a cause? No, it must\n\t\t\t\t\tboth exist and be a cause.  Consequently it will furthermore be a cause of goods or evils to\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain persons; whereas if fortune is to be eliminated altogether,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen nothing must be said to come about from fortune, in spite of the\n\t\t\t\t\tfact that, although there is another cause, because we do not see it\n\t\t\t\t\twe say that fortune is a causeowing to which people give it\n\t\t\t\t\tas a definition of fortune that it is a cause incalculable to human\n\t\t\t\t\treasoning, implying that it is a real natural principle. This, then,\n\t\t\t\t\twould be a matter for another inquiry. But since we see that some\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople have good fortune on one occasion, why should they not succeed\n\t\t\t\t\ta second time too owing to the same cause? and a third time? and a\n\t\t\t\t\tfourth? for the same cause produces the same effect.  Therefore this will not be a\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter of fortune; but when the same result follows from indeterminate\n\t\t\t\t\tand in definite antecedents, it will be good or bad for somebody, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthere will not be the knowledge of it that comes by experience, since,\n\t\t\t\t\tif there were, some fortunate persons would learn it, or indeed all\n\t\t\t\t\tbranches of knowledge would, as Socrates said, be\n\t\t\t\t\tforms of good fortune. \n\t\t\t\t\tWhat, then, prevents such things from happening to somebody a number\n\t\t\t\t\tof times running not because he has a certain character, but in the\n\t\t\t\t\tway in which for instance it would be possible to make the highest\n\t\t\t\t\tthrow at dice every time? And what then? are there not some impulses\n\t\t\t\t\tin the spirit that arise from reasoning and others from irrational\n\t\t\t\t\tappetition? and are not the latter prior?because if the impulse caused by desire for\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is pleasant exists by nature, appetition also would merely by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature proceed towards what is good in every case.  If, therefore, some men have\n\t\t\t\t\tgood naturesjust as musical people though they have not\n\t\t\t\t\tlearnt to sing have a natural aptitude for itand\n\t\t\t\t\twithout the aid of reason have an impulse in the direction of the\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural order of things and desire the right thing in the right way at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe right time, these men will succeed even although they are in fact\n\t\t\t\t\tfoolish and irrational, just as the others will sing well although\n\t\t\t\t\tunable to teach singing. And men of this sort obviously are\n\t\t\t\t\tfortunatemen who without the aid of reason are usually\n\t\t\t\t\tsuccessful. Hence it will follow that the fortunate are so by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature.Or has the term 'good fortune' more than one\n\t\t\t\t\tmeaning? For some things are done from impulse and as a result of the\n\t\t\t\t\tagents' purposive choice, other things not so but on the contrary; and\n\t\t\t\t\tif in the former cases when the agents succeed they seem to have\n\t\t\t\t\treasoned badly, we say that in fact they have had good fortune; and\n\t\t\t\t\tagain in the latter cases, if they wished for a different good or less\n\t\t\t\t\tgood than they have got. \n\t\t\t\t\tThe former persons then may possibly owe their good fortune to nature,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor their impulse and appetition, being for the right object,\n\t\t\t\t\tsucceeded, but their reasoning was foolish; and in their case, when it\n\t\t\t\t\thappens that their reasoning seems to be incorrect but that impulse is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cause of it, this impulse being right has saved them; although\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes on the contrary owing to appetite they have reasoned in this\n\t\t\t\t\tway and come to misfortune.  But in the case of the others, then, how will good fortune be due\n\t\t\t\t\tto natural goodness of appetition and desire? The fact is that the good fortune here and that in the\n\t\t\t\t\tother case are the same. Or is good fortune of more than one kind, and\n\t\t\t\t\tis fortune twofold?  But\n\t\t\t\t\tsince we see some people being fortunate contrary to all the teachings\n\t\t\t\t\tof science and correct calculation, it is clear that the cause of good\n\t\t\t\t\tfortune must be something different. But is it or is it not good\n\t\t\t\t\tfortune whereby a man formed a desire for the right thing and at the\n\t\t\t\t\tright time when in his case human reasoning could not make this\n\t\t\t\t\tcalculation? For a thing the desire for which is natural is not\n\t\t\t\t\taltogether uncalculated, but the reasoning is perverted by something.\n\t\t\t\t\t So no doubt he\n\t\t\t\t\tseems fortunate, because fortune is the cause of things contrary to\n\t\t\t\t\treason, and this is contrary to reason, for it is contrary to\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge and to general principle.  But probably it does not really come from fortune,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut seems to do so from the above cause. So that this argument does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot prove that good fortune comes by nature, but that not all those\n\t\t\t\t\twho seem fortunate succeed because of fortune, but because of nature;\n\t\t\t\t\tnor does it prove that there is no such thing as fortune, nor that\n\t\t\t\t\tfortune is not the cause of anything, but that it is not the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tall the things of which it seems to be the cause.Yet someone may raise the question whether fortune is the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tprecisely thisforming a desire for the right thing at the\n\t\t\t\t\tright time. Or, on that showing, will not fortune be the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\teverythingeven of thought and deliberation? since it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case, that one only deliberates when one has deliberated even\n\t\t\t\t\tpreviously to that deliberation,nor does one only think when one has previously thought\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore thinking, and so on to infinity, but there is some\n\t\t\t\t\tstarting-point; therefore thought is not the starting-point of\n\t\t\t\t\tthinking, nor deliberation of deliberating. Then what else is, save\n\t\t\t\t\tfortune? It will follow that everything originates from fortune. Or\n\t\t\t\t\tshall we say that there is a certain starting-point outside which\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is no other, and that this, merely owing to its being of such\n\t\t\t\t\tand such a nature, can produce a result of such and such a nature?\n\t\t\t\t\t But this is what\n\t\t\t\t\twe are investigatingwhat is the starting-point of motion in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe spirit? The answer then is clear: as in the universe, so there,\n\t\t\t\t\teverything is moved by God; for in a manner the divine element in us\n\t\t\t\t\tis the cause of all our motions.  And the starting-point of reason is not reason but\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething superior to reason. What, then, could be superior even to\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge and to intellect, except God? Not goodness, for goodness is\n\t\t\t\t\tan instrument of the mind; and owing to this, as I was saying some\n\t\t\t\t\ttime ago, those are called\n\t\t\t\t\tfortunate who although irrational succeed in whatever they start on.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd it does not pay them to deliberate, for they have within them a\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple of a kind that is better than mind and deliberation\n\t\t\t\t\t (whereas the\n\t\t\t\t\tothers have reason but have not this): they have inspiration, but they\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot deliberate. For although irrational they attain even what\n\t\t\t\t\tbelongs to the prudent and wiseswiftness of divination:\n\t\t\t\t\tonly the divination that is based on reason we must not specify, but\n\t\t\t\t\tsome of them attain it by experience and others by practice in the use\n\t\t\t\t\tof observation; and these men use the divine. For this quality discerns aright the future as\n\t\t\t\t\twell as the present, and these are the men whose reason is\n\t\t\t\t\tdisengaged. This is why the melancholic even have dreams\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are true; for it seems that when the reason is disengaged\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple has more strength just as the\n\t\t\t\t\tblind remember better, being released from having their faculty of\n\t\t\t\t\tmemory engaged with objects of sight.It is clear, then, that there are two kinds of good\n\t\t\t\t\tfortuneone divine, owing to which the fortunate man's\n\t\t\t\t\tsuccess is thought to be due to the aid of God, and this is the man\n\t\t\t\t\twho is successful in accordance with his impulse, while the other is\n\t\t\t\t\the who succeeds against his impulse. Both persons are irrational. The\n\t\t\t\t\tformer kind is more continuous good fortune, the latter is not\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinuous.We have, then, previously\n\t\t\t\t\tspoken about each virtue in particular; and as we have distinguished\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir meaning separately, we must also describe in detail the virtue\n\t\t\t\t\tconstituted from them, to which we now give the name of nobility.\n\t\t\t\t\tNow it is manifest that one who is to obtain this appellation truly\n\t\t\t\t\tmust possess the particular virtues; for it is impossible for it to be\n\t\t\t\t\totherwise in the case of any other matter eitherfor\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance, no one is healthy in his whole body but not in any part of\n\t\t\t\t\tit, but all the parts, or most of them and the most important, must\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily be in the same condition as the whole.  Now being good and being noble\n\t\t\t\t\tare really different not only in their names but also in themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor all goods have Ends that are desirable in and for\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves. Of these, all those are fine\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are laudable as existing for their own sakes, for these are the\n\t\t\t\t\tEnds which are both the motives of laudable actions and laudable\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselvesjustice itself and its actions, and temperate\n\t\t\t\t\tactions, for temperance also is laudable; but health is not laudable,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor its effect is not, nor is vigorous action laudable, for strength\n\t\t\t\t\tis notthese things are good but they are not laudable.\n\t\t\t\t\t And similarly\n\t\t\t\t\tinduction makes this clear in the other cases also. Therefore a man is\n\t\t\t\t\tgood for whom the things good by nature are good. For the things men\n\t\t\t\t\tfight about and think the greatest, honor and wealth and bodily\n\t\t\t\t\texcellences and pieces of good fortune and powers, are good by nature\n\t\t\t\t\tbut may possibly be harmful to some men owing to their characters. If\n\t\t\t\t\ta man is foolish or unjust or profligate he would gain no profit by\n\t\t\t\t\temploying them, any more than an invalid would benefit from using the\n\t\t\t\t\tdiet of a man in good health, or a weakling and cripple from the\n\t\t\t\t\tequipment of a healthy man and of a sound one.  A man is noble because he\n\t\t\t\t\tpossesses those good things that are fine for their own sake and\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause he is a doer of fine deeds even for their own sake; and the\n\t\t\t\t\tfine things are the virtues and the actions that arise from\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue.But there is also a state of character that\n\t\t\t\t\tis the 'civic' character, such as the Spartans have or others like\n\t\t\t\t\tthem may have; and this character is of the following sort. There are\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who think that one ought, it is true, to possess goodness, but\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the sake of the things that are naturally good; hence though they are good men (for the things naturally\n\t\t\t\t\tgood are good for them), yet they have not nobility, for it is not the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase with them that they possess fine things for their own sake and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they purpose fine actions, and not only this, but also that\n\t\t\t\t\tthings not fine by nature but good by nature are fine for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t For things are fine\n\t\t\t\t\twhen that for which men do them and choose them is fine. Therefore to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe noble man the things good by nature are fine; for what is just is\n\t\t\t\t\tfine, and what is according to worth is just, and he is worthy of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese things;  and what is\n\t\t\t\t\tbefitting is fine, and these things befit himwealth, birth,\n\t\t\t\t\tpower. Hence for the noble man the same things are both advantageous\n\t\t\t\t\tand fine; but for the multitude these things do not coincide, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthings absolutely good are not also good for them, whereas they are\n\t\t\t\t\tgood for the good man; and to the noble man they are also fine, for he\n\t\t\t\t\tperforms many fine actions because of them.  But he who thinks that one\n\t\t\t\t\tought to possess the virtues for the sake of external goods does fine\n\t\t\t\t\tthings only by accident. Nobility then is perfect goodness.We have also spoken about the nature of pleasure and the manner in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it is a good, and have said that things pleasant absolutely are\n\t\t\t\t\talso fine and that things good absolutely are also pleasant. Pleasure\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not occur except in action;on this account the truly happy man will also live most\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasantly, and it is not without reason that people demand\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.But since a doctor has a certain standard by\n\t\t\t\t\treferring to which he judges the healthy body and the goods unhealthy,\n\t\t\t\t\tand in relation to which each thing up to a certain point ought to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdone and is wholesome, but if less is done, or more, it ceases to be\n\t\t\t\t\twholesome, so in regard to actions and choices of things good by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature but not laudable a virtuous man ought to have a certain\n\t\t\t\t\tstandard both of character and of choice and avoidance; and also in regard to large and small amount of property\n\t\t\t\t\tand of good fortune.  Now\n\t\t\t\t\tin what preceded we stated the standard 'as reason directs'; but this is as if\n\t\t\t\t\tin matters of diet one were to say 'as medical science and its\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples direct,' and this though true is not clear.  It is proper, therefore, here\n\t\t\t\t\tas in other matters to live with reference to the ruling factor, and\n\t\t\t\t\tto the state and the activity of the ruling factor, as for example\n\t\t\t\t\tslave must live with reference to the rule of master, and each person\n\t\t\t\t\twith reference to the rule appropriate to each.  And since man consists by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature of a ruling part and a subject part, and each would properly\n\t\t\t\t\tlive with reference to the ruling principle within him (and this is\n\t\t\t\t\ttwofold, for medical science is a ruling principle in one way and\n\t\t\t\t\thealth is in another, and the former is a means to the latter), this\n\t\t\t\t\tis therefore the case in regard to the faculty of contemplation. For\n\t\t\t\t\tGod is not a ruler in the sense of issuing commands, but is the End as\n\t\t\t\t\ta means to which wisdom gives commands (and the term 'End' has two\n\t\t\t\t\tmeanings, but these have been distinguished elsewhere); since clearly God is in need of nothing.\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore whatever\n\t\t\t\t\tmode of choosing and of acquiring things good by\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturewhether goods of body or wealth or friends or the\n\t\t\t\t\tother goodswill best promote the contemplation of God, that\n\t\t\t\t\tis the best mode, and that standard is the finest;and any mode of choice and\n\t\t\t\t\tacquisition that either through deficiency or excess hinders us from\n\t\t\t\t\tserving and from contemplating Godthat is a bad one.\n\t\t\t\t\t This is how it is\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the spirit, and this is the best spiritual standardto\n\t\t\t\t\tbe as far as possible unconscious of the irrational part of the\n\t\t\t\t\tspirit, as such.Let this, then, be our\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement of what is the standard of nobility and what is the aim of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings absolutely good."}}]}}}}
