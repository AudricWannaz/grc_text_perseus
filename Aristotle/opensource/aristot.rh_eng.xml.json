The steps in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\targument will then be: if pleasure is the sensation of a certain emotion; if\n\t\t\t\t\t\timagination is a weakened faded sensation; if one who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremembers or hopes is attended by an imagination of what he remembers or\n\t\t\t\t\t\thopes; then, this being so, pleasure will attend one who remembers or hopes,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince there is sensation, and pleasure is sensation and a kind of movement\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsect. 1. , the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaculty of forming mental images variously translated\n\t\t\t\t\t\timagination, mental impression,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfantasy is defined by Aristotle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t as a , which cannot\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarise apart from sensation, and the movement produced must resemble the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsensation which produced it. But \n\t\t\t\t\t\tis more than this; it is not merely a faculty of sense, but occupies a place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmidway between sense and intellect; while imagination has need of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenses, the intellect has need of imagination.

This being so, it\n\t\t\t\t\tis evident that there is pleasure both for those who remember and for those who\n\t\t\t\t\thope, since there is sensation. Therefore all\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant things must either be present in sensation, or past in recollection, or\n\t\t\t\t\tfuture in hope; for one senses the present, recollects the past, and hopes for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe future.

And it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant to be admired, because of the mere honor. Flattery and the flatterer\n\t\t\t\t\tare pleasant, the latter being a sham admirer and friend. It is pleasant to do the same things often; for that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is familiar is, as we said, pleasant. Change also is pleasant, since change is in the order of nature; for perpetual\n\t\t\t\t\tsameness creates an excess of the normal condition; whence it was said:  This is why what we only see at intervals, whether men or things, is\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant; for there is a change from the present, and at the same time it is\n\t\t\t\t\trare. And learning and admiring are as a rule\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant; for admiring implies the desire to learn, so that what causes\n\t\t\t\t\tadmiration is to be desired, and learning implies a return to the normal.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is pleasant to bestow and to receive\n\t\t\t\t\tbenefits; the latter is the attainment of what we desire, the former the possession of more than\n\t\t\t\t\tsufficient means, both of them things that men\n\t\t\t\t\tdesire. Since it is pleasant to do good, it must also be pleasant for men to set\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir neighbors on their feet, and to supply their deficiencies. And since learning and admiring are pleasant, all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings connected with them must also be pleasant; for instance, a work of\n\t\t\t\t\timitation, such as painting, sculpture, poetry, and all that is well imitated,\n\t\t\t\t\teven if the object of imitation is not pleasant; for it is not this that causes\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure or the reverse, but the inference that the imitation and the object\n\t\t\t\t\timitated are identical, so that the result is that we learn something.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe same may be said of sudden changes and\n\t\t\t\t\tnarrow escapes from danger; for all these things excite wonder. And since that which is in accordance with nature is\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant, and things which are akin are akin in accordance with nature, all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings akin and like are for the most part pleasant to each other, as man to\n\t\t\t\t\tman; horse to horse, youth to youth.

And if the sufferer, having been wronged, has\n\t\t\t\t\tinflicted some terrible injury upon himself, the guilty person deserves greater\n\t\t\t\t\tpunishment; wherefore Sophocles, when pleading on behalf of Euctemon, who had\n\t\t\t\t\tcommitted suicide after the outrage he had suffered, declared that he would not assess the punishment at\n\t\t\t\t\tless than the victim had assessed it for himself. A wrong act is also greater when it is unprecedented, or the first of\n\t\t\t\t\tits kind, or when committed with the aid of few accomplices; and when it has been\n\t\t\t\t\tfrequently committed; or when because of it new prohibitions and penalties have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen sought and found: thus, at \n\t\t\t\t\tthe citizen owing to whom a new law has been passed, is punished, as well as\n\t\t\t\t\tthose on whose account a new prison had to be built. The crime is greater, the more brutal it is; or when it has been for\n\t\t\t\t\ta long time premeditated; when the recital of it inspires terror rather than\n\t\t\t\t\tpity. Rhetorical tricks of the following kind may be used:the\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement that the accused person has swept away or violated several principles\n\t\t\t\t\tof justice, for example, oaths, pledges of friendship, plighted word, the\n\t\t\t\t\tsanctity of marriage; for this amounts to heaping crime upon crime. Wrong acts are greater when committed in the very\n\t\t\t\t\tplace where wrongdoers themselves are sentenced, as is done by false witnesses;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor where would a man not commit wrong, if he does so in a court of justice?\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are also greater when accompanied by the greatest disgrace; when committed\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst one who has been the guilty person's benefactor, for in that case, the\n\t\t\t\t\twrongdoer is guilty of wrong twice over, in that he not only does wrong, but\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not return good for good. So too, again,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen a man offends against the unwritten laws of right, for there is greater\n\t\t\t\t\tmerit in doing right without being compelled; now the\n\t\t\t\t\twritten laws involve compulsion, the unwritten do not. Looked at in another way,\n\t\t\t\t\twrongdoing is greater, if it violates the written laws; for a man who commits\n\t\t\t\t\twrongs that alarm him and involve punishment, will be ready to\n\t\t\t\t\tcommit wrongfor which he will not be punished. Let this\n\t\t\t\t\tsuffice for the treatment of the greater or less degree of wrongdoing."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "15"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}], "note": [{"@resp": "Freese", "@anchored": "yes", "emph": "may", "#text": "Although the use of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinartificial proofs is almost entirely confined to forensic oratory, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t be used in deliberative oratory."}, {"@resp": "Freese", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Which is the administration of real justice, not that which appears to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegislator to be such and is embodied in legal enactments."}, {"@resp": "Freese", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Cp.14.7 above."}], "pb": {"@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "1375b"}, "lb": [{"@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "1"}, {"@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "20"}], "quote": {"lg": {"@type": "iamb", "l": {"note": {"@resp": "Freese", "@anchored": "yes", "bibl": {"@n": "Soph.

These proofs are five in number: laws, witnesses,\n\t\t\t\t\tcontracts, torture, oaths. Let us first then\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak of the laws, and state what use should be made of them when exhorting or\n\t\t\t\t\tdissuading, accusing or\n\t\t\t\t\tdefending. For it is evident that, if the\n\t\t\t\t\twritten law is counter to our case, we must have recourse to the general law and\n\t\t\t\t\tequity, as more in accordance with justice; and\n\t\t\t\t\twe must argue that, when the dicast takes an oath to decide to the best of his\n\t\t\t\t\tjudgement, he means that he will not abide rigorously by the written laws;\n\t\t\t\t\tthat equity is ever constant and never\n\t\t\t\t\tchanges, even as the general law, which is based on nature, whereas the written\n\t\t\t\t\tlaws often vary this is why Antigone in Sophocles justifies herself\n\t\t\t\t\tfor having buried Polynices contrary to the law of Creon, but not contrary to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe unwritten law: \n\t\t\t\t\tand further, that justice is real and\n\t\t\t\t\texpedient, but not that which only appears just; nor the written law either,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause it does not do the work of the law; that the\n\t\t\t\t\tjudge is like an assayer of silver, whose duty is to distinguish spurious from\n\t\t\t\t\tgenuine justice; that it is the part of a\n\t\t\t\t\tbetter man to make use of and abide by the unwritten rather than the written\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw.\n\t\t\t\t\tAgain, it is necessary to see whether the law\n\t\t\t\t\tis contradictory to another approved law or to itself; for instance, one law\n\t\t\t\t\tenacts that all contracts should be binding, while another forbids making\n\t\t\t\t\tcontracts contrary to the law. If the meaning\n\t\t\t\t\tof the law is equivocal, we must turn it about, and see in which way it is to be\n\t\t\t\t\tinterpreted so as to suit the application of justice or expediency, and have\n\t\t\t\t\trecourse to that. If the conditions which led\n\t\t\t\t\tto the enactment of the law are now obsolete, while the law itself remains, one\n\t\t\t\t\tmust endeavor to make this clear and to combat the law by this argument.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut if the written law favors our case, we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust say that the oath of the dicast to decide to the best of his\n\t\t\t\t\tjudgement does not justify him in deciding contrary to the law, but\n\t\t\t\t\tis only intended to relieve him from the charge of perjury, if he is ignorant of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe meaning of the law; that no one chooses that which is good absolutely, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is good for himself;that there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference between not using the laws and their not being enacted; that in the\n\t\t\t\t\tother arts there is no advantage in trying to be wiser than the physician, for\n\t\t\t\t\tan error on his part does not do so much harm as the habit of disobeying the\n\t\t\t\t\tauthority; that to seek to be wiser than the laws is just what is forbidden in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe most approved laws.

And the\n\t\t\t\t\tapophthegm of Xenophanes is apposite that it is unfairfor an impious man to challenge a pious one,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor it is the same as a strong man challenging a weak one to hit or be hit.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you accept the oath, you may say that\n\t\t\t\t\tyou have confidence in yourself, but not in your opponent, and, reversing the\n\t\t\t\t\tapophthegm of Xenophanes, that the only fair way is that the impious man should\n\t\t\t\t\ttender the oath and the pious man take it; and that it would be monstrous to\n\t\t\t\t\trefuse to take the oath yourself, while demanding that the judges should take it\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore giving their verdict. But if you tender\n\t\t\t\t\tthe oath, you may say that it is an act of piety to be willing to leave the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter to the gods; that your opponent has no need to look for other judges, for\n\t\t\t\t\tyou allow him to make the decision himself; and that it would be ridiculous that he should be unwilling to take an oath in\n\t\t\t\t\tcases where he demands that the dicasts should take one."}, {"pb": {"@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "1377b"}, "lb": {"@ed": "Bekker", "@n": "1"}, "milestone": {"@unit": "section", "@n": "33"}, "note": {"@resp": "Freese", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The defence in such cases is: 1 that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevious oath was taken as a result of fraud or compulsion;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 that you did not mean what you said."}, "#text": "Now, since we have shown how we must deal with each case individually, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear how we must deal with them when taken two and two; for instance, if we\n\t\t\t\t\twish to take the oath but not to tender it, to tender it but not to take it, to\n\t\t\t\t\taccept and tender it, or to do neither the one nor the other.

Let us then\n\t\t\t\t\tdefine making mild as the quieting and appeasing of anger. If then men are angry with those who slight them, and\n\t\t\t\t\tslight is voluntary, it is evident that they are mild towards those who do none\n\t\t\t\t\tof these things, or do them involuntarily, or at least appear to be such;\n\t\t\t\t\tand towards those who intended the opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tof what they have done, and all who behave in the same way to themselves, for no\n\t\t\t\t\tone is likely to slight himself. And towards\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who admit and are sorry for a slight; for finding as it were satisfaction\n\t\t\t\t\tin the pain the offenders feel at what they have done, men cease to be angry.\n\t\t\t\t\tEvidence of this may be seen in the punishment of slaves; for we punish more\n\t\t\t\t\tseverely those who contradict us and deny their offence, but cease to be angry\n\t\t\t\t\twith those who admit that they are justly punished. The reason is that to deny\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is evident is disrespect, and disrespectis slight\n\t\t\t\t\tand contempt; anyhow, we show no respect for\n\t\t\t\t\tthose for whom we entertain a profound contempt. Men also are mild towards those\n\t\t\t\t\twho humble themselves before them and do not contradict them, for they seem to\n\t\t\t\t\trecognize that they are inferior; now, those who are inferior are afraid, and no\n\t\t\t\t\tone who is afraid slights another. Even the behavior of dogs proves that anger\n\t\t\t\t\tceases towards those who humble themselves, for they do not bite those who sit\n\t\t\t\t\tdown.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd men are mild towards those who are serious\n\t\t\t\t\twith them when they are serious, for they think they are being treated\n\t\t\t\t\tseriously, not with contempt. And towards those\n\t\t\t\t\twho have rendered them greater services. And towards those who\n\t\t\t\t\twant something and deprecate their anger, for they are humbler. And towards those who refrain from insulting, mocking,\n\t\t\t\t\tor slighting anyone, or any virtuous man, or those who resemble themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd generally speaking, one can determine\n\t\t\t\t\tthe reasons that make for mildness by their opposites. Thus, men are mild\n\t\t\t\t\ttowards those whom they fear or respect, as long as they feel so towards them,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor it is impossible to be afraid and angry at the same time. And against those who have acted in anger they either\n\t\t\t\t\tfeel no anger or in a less degree, for they do not seem to have acted from a\n\t\t\t\t\tdesire to slight.

Again, vengeance\n\t\t\t\t\tpreviously taken upon one person appeases anger against another, even though it\n\t\t\t\t\tbe greater. Wherefore Philocrates, when someone\n\t\t\t\t\tasked him why he did not justify himself when the people were angry with him,\n\t\t\t\t\tmade the judicious reply, Not yet. When\n\t\t\t\t\tthen? When I see someone accused of the same\n\t\t\t\t\toffence; for men grow mild when they have exhausted their anger upon\n\t\t\t\t\tanother, as happened in the case of Ergophilus. For although the Athenians were more\n\t\t\t\t\tindignant with him than with Callisthenes, they acquitted him, because they had\n\t\t\t\t\tcondemned CalIicrates to death on the previous day. Men also grow mild towards those whom they pity; and if an offender has suffered greater evil than those who\n\t\t\t\t\tare angry would have inflicted, for they have an idea that they have as it were\n\t\t\t\t\tobtained reparation. And if they think that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey themselves are wrong and deserve what they suffer, for anger is not aroused\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst what is just; they no longer think that they are being treated otherwise\n\t\t\t\t\tthan they should be, which, as we have said, is the essence of anger. Wherefore\n\t\t\t\t\twe should inflict a preliminary verbal chastisement, for even slaves are less\n\t\t\t\t\tindignant at punishmentof this kind. And men are milder if they think that those punished\n\t\t\t\t\twill never know that the punishment comes from  in requital for\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir own wrongs; for anger has to do with the individual, as is clear from our\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition.\n\t\t\t\t\tWherefore it is justly said by the poet:  as if Polyphemus would not have been punished, had he\n\t\t\t\t\tremained ignorant who had blinded him and for what. So that men are not angry\n\t\t\t\t\teither with any others who cannot know who punishes them, or with the dead, since they have paid the last\n\t\t\t\t\tpenalty and can feel neither pain nor anything else, which is the aim of those\n\t\t\t\t\twho are angry. So then, in regard\n\t\t\t\t\tto Hector, Homer, when desirous of restraining the anger of Achilles against a\n\t\t\t\t\tdead man, well says: \n\t\t\t\t\tIt is evident, then, that men must have\n\t\t\t\t\trecourse to these topics when they desire to appease their audience, putting\n\t\t\t\t\tthem into the frame of mind required and representing those with whom they are\n\t\t\t\t\tangry as either formidable or deserving of respect, or as having rendered them\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat services, or acted involuntarily, or as exceedingly grieved at what they\n\t\t\t\t\thave done."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}], "note": {"@resp": "Freese", "@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "filei=n"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "fili/a"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "fi/los"}, {"@lang": "fr", "#text": "aimer"}, {"@lang": "de", "#text": "lieben"}], "#text": "may be translated to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlove or to like;  by love,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliking, or friendship; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t friend\n\t\t\t\t\t\talone is suitable.

Similarly, in regard to each of all the\n\t\t\t\t\tother vices of character, the acts resulting from them, their signs, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which resemble them, all these are disgraceful, and should make us\n\t\t\t\t\tashamed.

And we are ashamed when we suffer or have suffered or are likely to suffer\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which tend to ignominy and reproach; such are prostituting one's person\n\t\t\t\t\tor performing disgraceful actions, including unnatural lust.

Similarly, if of two\n\t\t\t\t\tlike things the one is possible, so also is the other. And if the harder of two things is possible, so also is the easier.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd if it is possible for a thing to be\n\t\t\t\t\tmade excellent or beautiful, it is possible for\n\t\t\t\t\tit to be made in general; for it is harder for a beautiful house to be made than\n\t\t\t\t\ta mere house.\n\t\t\t\t\tAgain, if the beginning is possible, so also is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe end; for no impossible thing comes, or begins to come, into existence; for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance, that the diameter of a square should be commensurable with the side of\n\t\t\t\t\ta square is neither possible nor could be possible. And when the end is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible, so also is the beginning; for all things arise from a beginning.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd if that which is subsequent inbeing or generation can come into being, so then can\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is antecedent; for instance, if a man can come into being, so can a\n\t\t\t\t\tchild, for the child is antecedent; and similarly, if a child can come into\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing, so can a man, for the child is a beginning. And things which we love or desire naturally are possible; for as a\n\t\t\t\t\trule no one loves the impossible or desires it. And those things which form the subject of sciences or arts can also exist and\n\t\t\t\t\tcome into existence. And so with all those\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, the productive principles of which reside in those things which we can\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrol by force or persuasion, when they depend upon those whose superiors,\n\t\t\t\t\tmasters, or friends we are. And if the parts\n\t\t\t\t\tare possible, so also is the whole; and if the whole is possible, so also are\n\t\t\t\t\tthe parts, speaking generally; for instance, if the front, toe-cap, and upper\n\t\t\t\t\tleather, can be made, then shoes can be made, and if shoes,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen the above parts. And if the whole genus\n\t\t\t\t\tis among things possible\n\t\t\t\t\tto be made, so is the species, and if the species, so the genus; for example, if\n\t\t\t\t\ta vessel can be built, so can a trireme, if a trireme can, so can a vessel.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf of two naturally corresponding things\n\t\t\t\t\tone is possible, so also is the other; for instance, if the double is possible,\n\t\t\t\t\tso is the half, if the half, so the double. If\n\t\t\t\t\ta thing can be made without art or preparation, much the more can it be made\n\t\t\t\t\twith the help of art and carefulness. Whence it was said by Agathon: \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd if a thing is possible for those who are\n\t\t\t\t\tinferior, or weaker, or less intelligent, it will be still more so for those\n\t\t\t\t\twhose qualities are the opposite; as Isocrates said, it would be very strange if\n\t\t\t\t\the were unable by himself to find out what Euthynus had learnt with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe help of others.

And as the enthymeme\n\t\t\t\t\tis, we may say, the syllogism dealing\n\t\t\t\t\twith such things, maxims are the premises or conclusions of enthymemes without\n\t\t\t\t\tthe syllogism.

The demonstrative enthymeme draws conclusions from\n\t\t\t\t\tadmitted premises, the refutative draws conclusions disputed by the\n\t\t\t\t\tadversary.\n\t\t\t\t\tWe know nearly all the general heads of each\n\t\t\t\t\tof the special topics that are useful or necessary; for the propositions\n\t\t\t\t\trelating to each have been selected, so that we have in like manner already\n\t\t\t\t\testablished all the topics from which enthymemes may be derived on the subject\n\t\t\t\t\tof good or bad, fair or foul, just or unjust, characters, emotions, and habits.\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us now endeavor to find topics about enthymemes in general in\n\t\t\t\t\tanother way, noting in passing those which are refutative and those which are\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstrative, and those of apparent enthymemes, which are not really\n\t\t\t\t\tenthymemes, since they are not syllogisms.

This will be secured by observing due proportion;\n\t\t\t\t\totherwise there will be a lack of propriety, because it is when placed in\n\t\t\t\t\tjuxtaposition that contraries are most evident. We must consider, as a red cloak\n\t\t\t\t\tsuits a young man, what suits an old one; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same garment is not suitable for both. And if we wish to ornament our\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject, we must derive our metaphor from the better species under the same\n\t\t\t\t\tgenus; if to depreciate it, from the worse. Thus, to say for you have\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo opposites belonging to the same genus that the man who begs prays,\n\t\t\t\t\tor that the man who prays begs for both are forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tasking is an instance of doing this; as, when Iphicrates called Calliasa mendicant priest instead of a torch-bearer, Callias\n\t\t\t\t\treplied that Iphicrates himself could not be initiated, otherwise he would not\n\t\t\t\t\thave called him mendicant priest but torch-bearer; both titles indeed have to do\n\t\t\t\t\twith a divinity, but the one is honorable, the other dishonorable.

The saying in the  of\n\t\t\t\t\tEuripides,  is inappropriate, because the word ruling exceeds the dignity of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject, and so the artifice can be seen.

Metaphors should also\n\t\t\t\t\tbe derived from things that are beautiful, the beauty of a word consisting, as\n\t\t\t\t\tLicymnius says, in its sound or sense, and its ugliness in the same.

But purity,which is the\n\t\t\t\t\tfoundation of style, depends upon five rules. First, connecting particles should be introduced in their natural order,\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore or after, as they require; thus,  and\n\t\t\t\t\t require to be followed by\n\t\t\t\t\t and . Further, they should be made to correspond whilst the hearer\n\t\t\t\t\tstill recollects; they should not be put too far apart, nor should a clause be\n\t\t\t\t\tintroduced before the necessary connection; for this is rarely appropriate. For instance,\n\t\t\t\t\tAs for me, I, after he had told mefor Cleon came begging\n\t\t\t\t\tand prayingset out, taking them with me. For in this\n\t\t\t\t\tphrase several connecting words have been foisted in before the one which is to\n\t\t\t\t\tfurnish the apodosis; and if the interval between I and\n\t\t\t\t\tset out is too great, the result is obscurity. The first rule therefore is to make a proper use of\n\t\t\t\t\tconnecting particles; the second, to employ special, not generic terms.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe third consists in avoiding ambiguous\n\t\t\t\t\tterms, unless you deliberately intend the opposite, like those who, having\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing to say, yet pretend to say something; such people accomplish this by the\n\t\t\t\t\tuse of verse, after the manner of Empedocles. For the long circumlocution takes in the\n\t\t\t\t\thearers, who find themselves affected like the majority of those who listen to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe soothsayers. For when the latter utter their ambiguities, they also assent;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example, \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd as there is less chance of\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking a mistake when speaking generally, diviners express themselves in general\n\t\t\t\t\tterms on the question of fact; for, in playing odd or even, one is more likely\n\t\t\t\t\tto be right if he says even or odd\n\t\t\t\t\tthan if he gives a definite number, and similarly one who says it\n\t\t\t\t\twill be than if he states when. This is why\n\t\t\t\t\tsoothsayers do not further define the exact time. All such ambiguities are\n\t\t\t\t\talike, wherefore they should be avoided, except for some such reason.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fourth rule consists in keeping the genders\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinctmasculine, feminine, and neuter, as laid down by Protagoras; these also must be properly\n\t\t\t\t\tintroduced: She, having come\n\t\t\t\t\t. and having conversed\n\t\t\t\t\t. with me, went away. The\n\t\t\t\t\tfifth rule consists in observing number, according as many, few, or one are\n\t\t\t\t\treferred to: They, having come .,\n\t\t\t\t\tbegan to beat . me."}, {"note": [{"@resp": "Freese", "@anchored": "yes", "placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7002499", "#text": "Ephesus"}, "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "o(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tskoteino/s"}, "#text": "Heraclitus of  c. 535-475.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHis chief work was on Nature.

Leptines,\n\t\t\t\t\tspeaking of the Lacedaemonians, said that he would not let the Athenians stand\n\t\t\t\t\tby and see  deprived of one of\n\t\t\t\t\ther eyes. When Chares was eager to have his accounts for the Olynthian war\n\t\t\t\t\texamined, Cephisodotus indignantly exclaimed that, now he had the people by the\n\t\t\t\t\tthroat, he was trying to get his accounts examined; on another occasion\n\t\t\t\t\talso he exhorted the Athenians to set out for  without delay and provision themselves there,\n\t\t\t\t\tlike the decree of Miltiades. After the\n\t\t\t\t\tAthenians had made peace with \n\t\t\t\t\tand the maritime cities, Iphicrates indignantly declared that they\n\t\t\t\t\thad deprived themselves of provisions for the war. Pitholaus called the Paralus the bludgeon of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people, and \n\t\t\t\t\tthe corn-chest of the . Pericles recommended that , the eyesore of the\n\t\t\t\t\t, should be\n\t\t\t\t\tremoved. Moerocles, mentioning a very respectable person\n\t\t\t\t\tby name, declared that he was as much a scoundrel as himself; for whereas that\n\t\t\t\t\thonest man played the scoundrel at 33 per cent. he himself was satisfied with 10\n\t\t\t\t\tper cent. And the iambic of\n\t\t\t\t\tAnaxandrides, on girls who wereslow to\n\t\t\t\t\tmarry,  And the saying of Polyeuctus upon a certain paralytic named\n\t\t\t\t\tSpeusippus, that he could not keep quiet, although Fortune had bound\n\t\t\t\t\thim in a five-holed pillory of disease. Cephisodotus called the\n\t\t\t\t\ttriremes parti-colored mills, and\n\t\t\t\t\tDiogenes the Cynic used to say that the taverns were the messes of\n\t\t\t\t\t. Aesion used to say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they had drained the State into , which is a metaphor\n\t\t\t\t\tand sets the thing before the eyes. His words so that  uttered a cry are also in a\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner a metaphor and a vivid one. And again, as Cephisodotus bade the Athenians\n\t\t\t\t\ttake care not to hold their concourses too often; and in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same way Isocrates, who spoke of those who rush\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether in the assemblies. And as\n\t\t\t\t\tLysias says in his Funeral Oration, that it was right that  should cut her hair at the tomb of\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who fell at , since her\n\t\t\t\t\tfreedom was buried along with their valor. If the speaker had said that it was\n\t\t\t\t\tfitting that  should weep, her\n\t\t\t\t\tvalor being buried with them, it would have been a metaphor and a vivid one, whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tfreedom by the side of valor\n\t\t\t\t\tproduces a kind of antithesis. And as Iphicrates said, The path of my\n\t\t\t\t\twords leads through the center of the deeds of Chares; here the\n\t\t\t\t\tmetaphor is proportional and the words through the center\n\t\t\t\t\tcreate vividness. Also, to say that one calls upon dangers to help\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst dangers is a vivid metaphor. And Lycoleon on behalf of\n\t\t\t\t\tChabrias said, not even reverencing the suppliant attitude of his\n\t\t\t\t\tstatue of bronze, a metaphor for the moment, not for all time, but still\n\t\t\t\t\tvivid; for when Chabrias is in danger, the statue intercedes for him, the\n\t\t\t\t\tinanimate becomes animate, the memorial of what he has done for the State. And\n\t\t\t\t\tin every way studying poorness of spirit, for studying a thing implies to\n\t\t\t\t\tincrease it. And that reason\n\t\t\t\t\tis a light that God has kindled in the soul, for both the words\n\t\t\t\t\treason and light make something clear. For we do not put an end to\n\t\t\t\t\twars, but put them off, for both ideas refer to the\n\t\t\t\t\tfutureputting off and a peace of such a kind.

For it becomes more evident to him that\n\t\t\t\t\the has learnt something, when the conclusion turns out contrary to his\n\t\t\t\t\texpectation, and the mind seems to say, How true it is! but I missed\n\t\t\t\t\tit. And smart apophthegms arise from not meaning what one says, as in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe apophthegm of Stesichorus, that the grasshoppers will sing to\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves from the ground. And clever riddles are agreeable for the same reason; for\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething is learnt, and the expression is also metaphorical. And what Theodorus\n\t\t\t\t\tcalls novel expressions arise when what follows is\n\t\t\t\t\tparadoxical, and, as he puts it, not in accordance with our previous\n\t\t\t\t\texpectation; just as humorists make use of slight changes in words. The same\n\t\t\t\t\teffect is produced by jokes that turn on a change of letter; for they are\n\t\t\t\t\tdeceptive. These novelties occur in poetry as well as in prose; for instance,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe following verse does not finish as the hearer expected:  whereas the hearer thought he was going to say\n\t\t\t\t\tsandals. This kind of joke must be clear from the moment\n\t\t\t\t\tof utterance. Jokes that turn on the word are produced, not by giving it the\n\t\t\t\t\tproper meaning, but by perverting it; for instance, when Theodorus said to\n\t\t\t\t\tNicon, the player on the cithara, you are troubled\n\t\t\t\t\t ; for while\n\t\t\t\t\tpretending to say something troubles you, he deceives us;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor he means something else.\n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore the joke is only\n\t\t\t\t\tagreeable to one who understands the point; for if one does not know that Nicon\n\t\t\t\t\tis a Thracian, he will not see any joke in it. Similarly, you wish to destroy him  .\n\t\t\t\t\tJokes of both these kinds must be suitably expressed.\n\t\t\t\t\tSimilar instances are such witticisms as saying that the empire of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sea was not the beginning of misfortunes\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the Athenians, for they benefited by it; or, with Isocrates, that\n\t\t\t\t\tempire was the beginning of misfortunes for the\n\t\t\t\t\tcity; in both cases that which one would not have expected to be said\n\t\t\t\t\tis said, and recognized as true. For, in the second example, to say that\n\t\t\t\t\tempire is empire shows no cleverness, but this is not what\n\t\t\t\t\the means, but something else; in the first, the  which is negatived is used in a different sense. In all these cases, success is attained when a word is\n\t\t\t\t\tappropriately applied, either by homonym or by metaphor. For example, in the\n\t\t\t\t\tphrase Anaschetos Bearable is Unbearable, there is a contradiction of the homonym, which is\n\t\t\t\t\tonly appropriate, if Anaschetus is an unbearable person. And, Thou\n\t\t\t\t\tshalt not be more of a stranger than a stranger, or not\n\t\t\t\t\tmore than you should be, which is the same thing. And again,  for here too the word repeated is taken in a different sense. It\n\t\t\t\t\tis the same with the celebrated verse of Anaxandrides,  for this is the same as saying that it is worthy to die when\n\t\t\t\t\tone does notdeserve to die, or, that\n\t\t\t\t\tit is worthy to die when one is not worthy of death, or,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen one does nothing that is worthy of death. Now the form of expression of these sayings is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame; but the more concisely and antithetically they are expressed, the greater\n\t\t\t\t\tis their popularity. The reason is that antithesis is more instructive and\n\t\t\t\t\tconciseness gives knowledge more rapidly. Further, in order that what is said may be true and not superficial, it must\n\t\t\t\t\talways either apply to a particular person or be suitably expressed; for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible for it to have one quality and not the other. For instance,\n\t\t\t\t\tOne ought to die guiltless of any offence, The\n\t\t\t\t\tworthy man should take a worthy woman to wife. There is no smartness\n\t\t\t\t\tin either of these expressions, but there will be if both conditions are\n\t\t\t\t\tfulfilled: It is worthy for a man to die, when he is not worthy of\n\t\t\t\t\tdeath. The more special qualities the expression possesses, the\n\t\t\t\t\tsmarter it appears; for instance, if the words contain a metaphor, and a\n\t\t\t\t\tmetaphor of a special kind, antithesis, and equality of clauses, and actuality."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "13"}], "note": [{"@resp": "Freese", "@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ai("}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)ei\\"}], "#text": "Or, reading\n\t\t\t\t\t\t for , approved similes are . . ."}, {"@resp": "Freese", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "In the simple metaphor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoblet is substituted for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshield, but sometimes additions are made to the word\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas differently applied, such as of Ares and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout strings.
