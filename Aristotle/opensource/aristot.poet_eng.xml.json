Epic poetry, then, and the poetry of tragic drama, and,\n\t\t\t\tmoreover, comedy and dithyrambic poetry, and most flute-playing and harp-playing,\n\t\t\t\tthese, speaking generally, may all be said to be \"representations of life.\"\n\t\t\t\t But they differ one from another in\n\t\t\t\tthree ways: either in using means generically different or\n\t\t\t\tin representing different objects or in representing objects not in the same way but\n\t\t\t\tin a different manner. For just as by\n\t\t\t\tthe use both of color and form people represent many objects, making likenesses of\n\t\t\t\t\tthemsome having a\n\t\t\t\tknowledge of art and some working empiricallyand just as others use the\n\t\t\t\thuman voice; so is it also in the arts which we have mentioned, they all make their\n\t\t\t\trepresentations in rhythm and language and tune, using these means either separately\n\t\t\t\tor in combination.  For tune and rhythm\n\t\t\t\talone are employed in flute-playing and harp-playing and in any other arts which\n\t\t\t\thave a similar function, as, for example, pipe-playing.  Rhythm alone without tune is employed by dancers in their\n\t\t\t\trepresentations, for by means of rhythmical gestures they represent both character\n\t\t\t\tand experiences and actions. But the art which\n\t\t\t\temploys words either in bare prose or in metres, either in one kind of metre or\n\t\t\t\tcombining several, happens up to the present day to have no name.  For we can find no common term to apply to the mimes\n\t\t\t\tof Sophron and Xenarchus and to the Socratic dialogues:  nor again supposing a poet were to make his representation in\n\t\t\t\tiambics or elegiacs or any other such metreexcept that people attach the\n\t\t\t\tword poetmakerto the name of the metre and speak of elegiac\n\t\t\t\tpoets and of others as epic poets. \n\t\t\t\tThus they do not call them poets in virtue of their representation but apply the\n\t\t\t\tname indiscriminately in virtue of the metre.  For if people publish medical or scientific treatises in\n\t\t\t\tmetre the custom is to call them poets. But Homer and Empedocles have nothing in common\n\t\t\t\texcept the metre, so that it would be proper to call the one a poet and the other not\n\t\t\t\ta poet but a scientist. Similarly if a man makes his representation\n\t\t\t\tby combining all the metres, as Chaeremon did when he wrote his rhapsody , a medley of all the metres, he too should be given the name of\n\t\t\t\t\tpoet. On this point the distinctions thus made may\n\t\t\t\t\tsuffice. There are certain arts which employ all the means which I\n\t\t\t\thave mentioned, such as rhythm and tune and metredithyrambic and \"nomic\"\n\t\t\t\t\tpoetry, for example, and tragedy too and comedy. The\n\t\t\t\tdifference here is that some use all these at once, others use now one now another.\n\t\t\t\t\t These differences then in the\n\t\t\t\tvarious arts I call the means of representation. Since living persons are the objects of representation, these must necessarily be\n\t\t\t\teither good men or inferiorthus only are characters normally\n\t\t\t\tdistinguished, since ethical differences depend upon vice and virtuethat\n\t\t\t\tis to say either better than ourselves or worse or much what we are. It is the same\n\t\t\t\twith painters.  Polygnotus depicted men\n\t\t\t\tas better than they are and Pauson worse, while Dionysius made likenesses.\n\t\t\t\t Clearly each of the above mentioned\n\t\t\t\tarts will admit of these distinctions, and they will differ in representing objects\n\t\t\t\twhich differ from each other in the way here described.  In painting too, and flute-playing and harp-playing, these\n\t\t\t\tdiversities may certainly be found, and it is the same in prose and in unaccompanied\n\t\t\t\tverse.  For instance Homer's people are\n\t\t\t\t\"better,\" Cleophon's are \"like,\" while in Hegemon of , the first writer of parodies, and in Nicochares, the author\n\t\t\t\tof the , they are \"worse.\"\n\t\t\t\t It is the same in dithyrambic and nomic\n\t\t\t\tpoetry, for instance . . . a writer might draw characters like the\n\t\t\t\t\tCyclops as drawn by Timotheus and Philoxenus.\n\t\t\t\t It is just in this respect that tragedy\n\t\t\t\tdiffers from comedy. The latter sets out to represent people as worse than they are\n\t\t\t\tto-day, the former as better. A third difference in these arts is the manner in\n\t\t\t\twhich one may represent each of these objects. For in representing\n\t\t\t\tthe same objects by the same means it is possible to proceed either partly by\n\t\t\t\tnarrative and partly by assuming a character other than your ownthis is\n\t\t\t\tHomer's methodor by remaining yourself without any such change, or else\n\t\t\t\tto represent the characters as carrying out the whole action themselves. These, as we\n\t\t\t\tsaid above, are the three differences which form the several species of the art of\n\t\t\t\trepresentation, the means, the objects, and the manner. It follows that in one respect\n\t\t\t\tSophocles would be the same kind of artist as Homer, for both represent good men,\n\t\t\t\tand in another respect he would resemble Aristophanes, for they both represent men\n\t\t\t\tin action and doing things. And that according to some is the reason why they are\n\t\t\t\tcalled \"dramas,\" because they present people as doing things.  And for this\n\t\t\t\treason the Dorians claim as their own both tragedy and comedycomedy is\n\t\t\t\tclaimed both by the Megarians here in , who say that it originated in the days of their democracy,\n\t\t\t\tand by the Megarians in , for it was\n\t\t\t\tfrom there the poet Epicharmus came, who was much earlier than Chionides and Magnes;\n\t\t\t\tand tragedy some of the Peloponnesians claim. Their evidence is the two names.\n\t\t\t\t\t Their name, they say, for suburb\n\t\t\t\tvillages is the Athenians call them\n\t\t\t\t\"Demes\"and comedians are so called not from , \"to revel,\" but because they were turned out of the towns\n\t\t\t\tand went strolling round the villages . Their word for action, they add, is , whereas the Athenian word is . So much then for the differences, their number, and their\n\t\t\t\t\tnature. Speaking generally, poetry seems to owe its origin to two particular causes, both\n\t\t\t\tnatural.  From childhood men have an\n\t\t\t\tinstinct for representation, and in this respect, differs from the other animals\n\t\t\t\tthat he is far more imitative and learns his first lessons by representing things.\n\t\t\t\tAnd then there is the enjoyment people always get from representations.  What happens in actual experience proves this,\n\t\t\t\tfor we enjoy looking at accurate likenesses of things which are themselves painful\n\t\t\t\tto see, obscene beasts, for instance, and corpses.  The reason is this: Learning things gives great pleasure not\n\t\t\t\tonly to philosophers but also in the same way to all other men, though they share\n\t\t\t\tthis pleasure only to a small degree. \n\t\t\t\tThe reason why we enjoy seeing likenesses is that, as we look, we learn and infer\n\t\t\t\twhat each is, for instance, \"that is so and so.\"  If we have never happened to see the original, our pleasure\n\t\t\t\tis not due to the representation as such but to the technique or the color or some\n\t\t\t\tother such cause. We have, then, a\n\t\t\t\tnatural instinct for representation and for tune and rhythmfor the metres are obviously sections of rhythmsand starting with these\n\t\t\t\tinstincts men very gradually developed them until they produced poetry out of their\n\t\t\t\timprovisations.  Poetry then split into\n\t\t\t\ttwo kinds according to the poet's nature. For the more serious poets represented\n\t\t\t\tfine doings and the doings of fine men, while those of a less exalted nature\n\t\t\t\trepresented the actions of inferior men, at first writing satire just as the others\n\t\t\t\tat first wrote hymns and eulogies. \n\t\t\t\tBefore Homer we cannot indeed name any such poem, though there were probably many\n\t\t\t\tsatirical poets,  but starting from\n\t\t\t\tHomer, there is, for instance, his  and other similar poems. For these the iambic metre was fittingly\n\t\t\t\tintroduced and that is why it is still called iambic, because it was the metre in\n\t\t\t\twhich they lampooned each other.\n\t\t\t\t Of the ancients some wrote heroic\n\t\t\t\tverse and some iambic.  And just as\n\t\t\t\tHomer was a supreme poet in the serious style, since he alone made his\n\t\t\t\trepresentations not only good but also dramatic, so, too, he was the first to mark\n\t\t\t\tout the main lines of comedy, since he made his drama not out of personal satire but\n\t\t\t\tout of the laughable as such. His  indeed provides an\n\t\t\t\tanalogy: as are the  and  to our\n\t\t\t\ttragedies, so is the  to our comedies. When tragedy and\n\t\t\t\tcomedy came to light, poets were drawn by their natural bent towards one or the\n\t\t\t\tother. Some became writers of comedies instead of lampoons, the others produced\n\t\t\t\ttragedies instead of epics; the reason being that the former is in each case a\n\t\t\t\thigher kind of art and has greater value.To consider\n\t\t\t\twhether tragedy is fully developed by now in all its various species or not, and to\n\t\t\t\tcriticize it both in itself and in relation to the stage, that is another question.\n\t\t\t\t\t At any rate it originated in\n\t\t\t\timprovisationboth tragedy itself and comedy. The one came from the\n\t\t\t\t\tprelude to the dithyramb and the\n\t\t\t\tother from the prelude to the phallic songs which still survive as institutions in\n\t\t\t\tmany cities.  Tragedy then gradually\n\t\t\t\tevolved as men developed each element that came to light and after going through\n\t\t\t\tmany changes, it stopped when it had found its own natural form.  Thus it was Aeschylus who first raised the number of\n\t\t\t\tthe actors from one to two. He also curtailed the chorus and gave the dialogue the\n\t\t\t\tleading part. Three actors and scene-painting Sophocles introduced.  Then as to magnitude.Being a development of the Satyr play, it was quite late before tragedy rose from short plots and\n\t\t\t\tcomic diction to its full dignity, and that the iambic metre was used instead of the\n\t\t\t\ttrochaic tetrameter.  At first they\n\t\t\t\tused the tetrameter because its poetry suited the Satyrs and was better for dancing,\n\t\t\t\tbut when dialogue was introduced, Nature herself discovered the proper metre. The\n\t\t\t\tiambic is indeed the most conversational of the metres,  and the proof is that in talking to each other we most often\n\t\t\t\tuse iambic lines but very rarely hexameters and only when we rise above the ordinary\n\t\t\t\tpitch of conversation.  Then there is\n\t\t\t\tthe number of acts. The further embellishments and the story of their introduction one by one we\n\t\t\t\tmay take as told,  for it would\n\t\t\t\tprobably be a long task to go through them in detail. Comedy, as we have said, is a\n\t\t\t\trepresentation of inferior people, not indeed in the full sense of the word bad, but\n\t\t\t\tthe laughable is a species of the base or ugly.\n\t\t\t\t It consists in some blunder or ugliness\n\t\t\t\tthat does not cause pain or disaster, an obvious example being the comic mask which\n\t\t\t\tis ugly and distorted but not painful. The various stages of tragedy and the\n\t\t\t\toriginators of each are well known, but comedy remains obscure because it was not at\n\t\t\t\tfirst treated seriously. Indeed it is only quite late in its history that the archon granted a chorus for a comic poet; before that they\n\t\t\t\twere volunteers.\n\t\t\t\t Comedy had already taken certain forms\n\t\t\t\tbefore there is any mention of those who are called its poets. Who introduced masks\n\t\t\t\tor prologues, the number of actors, and so on, is not known.  Plot making Epicharmus and\n\t\t\t\t\tPhormis originally came\n\t\t\t\tfrom ,  and of the Athenian poets Crates was the first to give up the lampooning form and to\n\t\t\t\tgeneralize his dialogue and plots. Epic poetry agreed with tragedy only in so far as it\n\t\t\t\twas a metrical representation of heroic action, but inasmuch as it has a single\n\t\t\t\tmetre and is narrative in that respect they are different.  And then as regards length, tragedy tends to fall within a\n\t\t\t\tsingle revolution of the sun or slightly to exceed that, whereas epic is unlimited\n\t\t\t\tin point of time;  and that is another\n\t\t\t\tdifference, although originally the practice was the same in tragedy as in epic\n\t\t\t\t\tpoetry. The constituent parts are some of them the same and some\n\t\t\t\tpeculiar to tragedy.  Consequently any\n\t\t\t\tone who knows about tragedy, good and bad, knows about epics too, since tragedy has\n\t\t\t\tall the elements of epic poetry, though the elements of tragedy are not all present\n\t\t\t\tin the epic. With the representation of life\n\t\t\t\tin hexameter verse and\n\t\t\t\twith comedy we will deal later. We must now treat of tragedy after first gathering\n\t\t\t\tup the definition of its nature which results from what we have said already.\n\t\t\t\t\t Tragedy is, then, a representation\n\t\t\t\tof an action that is\n\t\t\t\theroic and complete and of a certain magnitudeby means of language\n\t\t\t\tenriched with all kinds of ornament, each used separately in the different parts of\n\t\t\t\tthe play: it represents men in action and does not use narrative, and through pity\n\t\t\t\tand fear it effects relief to these and similar emotions.\n\t\t\t\t By \"language enriched\" I mean that\n\t\t\t\twhich has rhythm and tune, i.e., song, \n\t\t\t\tand by \"the kinds separately\" I mean that some effects are produced by verse alone\n\t\t\t\tand some again by song. Since the representation is performed by living persons, it\n\t\t\t\tfollows at once that one essential part of a tragedy is the spectacular effect, and,\n\t\t\t\tbesides that, song-making and diction. For these are the means of the\n\t\t\t\trepresentation.  By \"diction\" I mean\n\t\t\t\there the metrical arrangement of the words; and \"song making\" I use in the full,\n\t\t\t\tobvious sense of the word.  And since\n\t\t\t\ttragedy represents action and is acted by living persons, who must of necessity have\n\t\t\t\tcertain qualities of character and thoughtfor it is these which determine\n\t\t\t\tthe quality of an action; indeed thought and character are the natural causes of\n\t\t\t\tany action and it is in virtue of these that all men succeed or\n\t\t\t\t\tfail it follows then that\n\t\t\t\tit is the plot which represents the action. By \"plot\" I mean here the arrangement of\n\t\t\t\tthe incidents: \"character\" is that which determines the quality of the agents, and\n\t\t\t\t\"thought\" appears wherever in the dialogue they put forward an argument or deliver\n\t\t\t\tan opinion. Necessarily then every tragedy has six constituent parts, and on these its\n\t\t\t\tquality depends. These are plot, character, diction, thought, spectacle, and song.\n\t\t\t\t\t Two of these are the means of\n\t\t\t\trepresentation: one is the manner: three are the objects represented.\n\t\t\t\t This list is exhaustive, and\n\t\t\t\tpractically all the poets employ these elements, for every drama includes alike\n\t\t\t\tspectacle and character and plot and diction and song and thought. The most important of\n\t\t\t\tthese is the arrangement of the incidents, for tragedy is not a representation of men but\n\t\t\t\tof a piece of action, of life, of happiness and unhappiness, which come under the\n\t\t\t\thead of action, and the end aimed at is the representation not of qualities of\n\t\t\t\tcharacter but of some action; and while character makes men what they are,it's their actions and experiences that make\n\t\t\t\tthem happy or the opposite.  They do\n\t\t\t\tnot therefore act to represent character, but character-study is included for the\n\t\t\t\tsake of the action. It follows that the incidents and the plot are the end at which\n\t\t\t\ttragedy aims, and in everything the end aimed at is of prime importance.  Moreover, you could not have a tragedy\n\t\t\t\twithout action, but you can have one with out character-study.  Indeed the tragedies of most modern poets are without\n\t\t\t\tthis, and, speaking generally, there are many such writers, whose case is like that\n\t\t\t\tof Zeuxis compared with Polygnotus. The latter was good at depicting character, but there\n\t\t\t\tis nothing of this in Zeuxis's painting.  A further argument is that if a man writes a series of speeches full of character\n\t\t\t\tand excellent in point of diction and thought, he will not achieve the proper\n\t\t\t\tfunction of tragedy nearly so well as a tragedy which, while inferior in these\n\t\t\t\tqualities, has a plot or arrangement of incidents.  And furthermore, two of the most important elements in the\n\t\t\t\temotional effect of tragedy, \"reversals\" and \"discoveries,\" are parts of the plot.  And here is further proof: those who try to write\n\t\t\t\ttragedy are much sooner successful in language and character-study than in arranging\n\t\t\t\tthe incidents. It is the same with almost all the earliest poets. The plot then is the\n\t\t\t\tfirst principle and as it were the soul of tragedy: character comes second.\n\t\t\t\t\t It is much the same also in\n\t\t\t\tpainting; if a man smeared a canvas with the loveliest colors at random, it\n\t\t\t\twould not give as much pleasure as an outline in black and white.\n\t\t\t\t And it is mainly because a play is a\n\t\t\t\trepresentation of action that it also for that reason represents people. Third comes\n\t\t\t\t\"thought.\" This means the ability to say what is possible and appropriate. It comes\n\t\t\t\tin the dialogue and is the function of the statesman's or the rhetorician's\n\t\t\t\t\tart.\n\t\t\t\t The old writers made their characters\n\t\t\t\ttalk like statesmen, the moderns like\n\t\t\t\t\trhetoricians. Character is that which reveals choice, shows what sort of thing a man chooses or avoids in\n\t\t\t\tcircumstances where the choice is not obvious, so those speeches convey no character\n\t\t\t\tin which there is nothing whatever which the speaker chooses or avoids. \"Thought\" you\n\t\t\t\tfind in speeches which contain an argument that something is or is not, or a general\n\t\t\t\texpression of opinion. The fourth of the literary elements is the language. By this\n\t\t\t\tI mean, as we said above, the expression of meaning in words, and this is essentially the same in verse and in\n\t\t\t\t\tprose. Of the other elements which \"enrich\" tragedy the most\n\t\t\t\timportant is song-making.  Spectacle,\n\t\t\t\twhile highly effective, is yet quite foreign to the art and has nothing to do with\n\t\t\t\tpoetry. Indeed the effect of tragedy does not depend on its performance by actors,\n\t\t\t\tand, moreover,for achieving the\n\t\t\t\tspectacular effects the art of the costumier is more authoritative than that of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpoet.\n\t\t\t\tAfter these definitions we must next discuss the proper arrangement of the incidents\n\t\t\t\tsince this is the first and most important thing in tragedy.  We have laid it down that tragedy is a representation\n\t\t\t\tof an action that is whole and complete and of a certain magnitude, since a thing\n\t\t\t\tmay be a whole and yet have no magnitude.  A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end.  A beginning is that which is not a necessary consequent of\n\t\t\t\tanything else but after which something else exists or happens as a natural result.\n\t\t\t\t\t An end on the contrary is that\n\t\t\t\twhich is inevitably or, as a rule, the natural result of something else but from\n\t\t\t\twhich nothing else follows;  a middle\n\t\t\t\tfollows something else and something follows from it.  Well constructed plots must not therefore begin and end at\n\t\t\t\trandom, but must embody the formulae we have stated. Moreover, in everything that is\n\t\t\t\tbeautiful, whether it be a living creature or any organism composed of parts, these\n\t\t\t\tparts must not only be orderly arranged but must also have a certain magnitude of\n\t\t\t\ttheir own;  for beauty consists in\n\t\t\t\tmagnitude and ordered arrangement. From which it follows that neither would a very\n\t\t\t\tsmall creature be beautifulfor our view of it is almost instantaneous and\n\t\t\t\ttherefore confusednor a very large one, since being unable to\n\t\t\t\tview it all at once, we lose the effect of a single whole; for instance, suppose a\n\t\t\t\tcreature a thousand miles long.  As\n\t\t\t\tthen creatures and other organic structures must have a certain magnitude and yet be\n\t\t\t\teasily taken in by the eye, so too with plots: they must have length but must be\n\t\t\t\teasily taken in by the memory. The limit of length considered in relation to\n\t\t\t\tcompetitions and production before an audience\n\t\t\t\tdoes not concern this treatise. Had it been the rule to produce a hundred tragedies,\n\t\t\t\tthe performance would have been regulated by the water clock, as it is said they did\n\t\t\t\tonce in other days.  But as for the\n\t\t\t\tnatural limit of the action, the longer the better as far as magnitude goes,\n\t\t\t\tprovided it can all be grasped at once. To give a simple definition: the magnitude\n\t\t\t\twhich admits of a change from bad fortune to good or from good fortune to bad, in a\n\t\t\t\tsequence of events which follow one another either inevitably or according to\n\t\t\t\tprobability, that is the proper limit. A plot does not have unity, as some people\n\t\t\t\tthink, simply because it deals with a single hero. Many and indeed innumerable\n\t\t\t\tthings happen to an individual, some of which do not go to make up any unity, and\n\t\t\t\tsimilarly an individual is concerned in many actions which do not combine into a\n\t\t\t\tsingle piece of action. It seems therefore that all those poets are wrong who\n\t\t\t\thave written a  or  or other such\n\t\t\t\t\tpoems. They think that because Heracles was a single individual the plot\n\t\t\t\tmust for that reason have unity.  But\n\t\t\t\tHomer, supreme also in all other respects, was apparently well aware of this truth\n\t\t\t\teither by instinct or from knowledge of his art. For in writing an\n\t\t\t\t\t he did not put in all that ever happened to Odysseus, his\n\t\t\t\tbeing wounded on , for instance,\n\t\t\t\tor his feigned madness when the host was gatheredthese being events\n\t\t\t\tneither of which necessarily or probably led to the other, but he\n\t\t\t\tconstructed his  round a single action in our sense of the\n\t\t\t\tphrase. And the  the same.  As then in the other arts of representation a single\n\t\t\t\trepresentation means a representation of a single object, so too the plot being a\n\t\t\t\trepresentation of a piece of action must represent a single piece of action and the\n\t\t\t\twhole of it; and the component incidents must be so arranged that if one of them be\n\t\t\t\ttransposed or removed, the unity of the whole is dislocated and destroyed. For if\n\t\t\t\tthe presence or absence of a thing makes no visible difference, then it is not an\n\t\t\t\tintegral part of the whole. What we have said already makes it further clear that a\n\t\t\t\tpoet's object is not to tell what actually happened but what could and would happen\n\t\t\t\teither probably or inevitably.  The\n\t\t\t\tdifference between a historian and a poet is not that one writes in prose and the\n\t\t\t\tother in verse indeed the writings of Herodotus could be put into\n\t\t\t\tverse and yet would still be a kind of history, whether written in metre or not. The\n\t\t\t\treal difference is this, that one tells what happened and the other what might\n\t\t\t\thappen.  For this reason poetry is\n\t\t\t\tsomething more scientific and serious than history, because poetry tends to give\n\t\t\t\tgeneral truths while history gives particular facts. By a \"general truth\" I mean the\n\t\t\t\tsort of thing that a certain type of man will do or say either probably or\n\t\t\t\tnecessarily. That is what poetry aims at in giving names to the characters. A \"particular fact\" is what Alcibiades did\n\t\t\t\tor what was done to him.  In the case of\n\t\t\t\tcomedy this has now become obvious, for comedians construct their plots out of\n\t\t\t\tprobable incidents and then put in any names that occur to them. They do not, like\n\t\t\t\tthe iambic satirists, write about individuals.\n\t\t\t\t In tragedy, on the other hand, they\n\t\t\t\tkeep to real names. The reason is that what is possible carries conviction. If a\n\t\t\t\tthing has not happened, we do not yet believe in its possibility, but what has\n\t\t\t\thappened is obviously possible. Had it been impossible, it would not have\n\t\t\t\t\thappened. It is true that in some tragedies one or two of the names are\n\t\t\t\tfamiliar and the rest invented; indeed in some they are all invented, as for\n\t\t\t\tinstance in Agathon's , where both the incidents and the names are invented and yet it\n\t\t\t\tis none the less a favourite.  One need\n\t\t\t\tnot therefore endeavor invariably to keep to the traditional stories with which our\n\t\t\t\ttragedies deal. Indeed it would be absurd to do that, seeing that the familiar\n\t\t\t\tthemes are familiar only to a few and yet please all. It is clear, then,\n\t\t\t\tfrom what we have said that the poet must be a \"maker\" not of verses but of stories,\n\t\t\t\tsince he is a poet in virtue of his \"representation,\" and what he represents is\n\t\t\t\taction.  Even supposing he represents\n\t\t\t\twhat has actually happened, he is none the less a poet, for there is nothing to\n\t\t\t\tprevent some actual occurrences being the sort of thing that would probably or\n\t\t\t\tinevitably happen, and it is in virtue of that that he is their \"maker.\" Of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"simple\" plots and actions the worst are those which are \"episodic.\" By\n\t\t\t\tthis I mean a plot in which the episodes do not follow each other probably or\n\t\t\t\tinevitably.  Bad poets write such\n\t\t\t\tplays because they cannot help it, and good poets write them to please the actors.\n\t\t\t\tWriting as they do for competition, they often strain a plot beyond its capacity and\n\t\t\t\tare thus obliged to sacrifice continuity.\n\t\t\t\t But this is bad work, since\n\t\t\t\ttragedy represents not only a complete action but also incidents that cause fear and\n\t\t\t\tpity, and this happens most of all when the incidents are unexpected and yet one is\n\t\t\t\ta consequence of the other.\n\t\t\t\t For in that way the incidents will\n\t\t\t\tcause more amazement than if they happened mechanically and accidentally, since the\n\t\t\t\tmost amazing accidental occurrences are those which seem to have been providential,\n\t\t\t\tfor instance when the statue of Mitys at  killed the man who caused Mitys's death by falling on him at\n\t\t\t\ta festival. Such events do not seem to be mere accidents.  So such plots as these must necessarily be the\n\t\t\t\t\tbest. Some plots are \"simple\" and some \"complex,\" as indeed the actions represented by\n\t\t\t\tthe plots are obviously such.  By a\n\t\t\t\tsimple action I mean one that is single and continuous in the sense of our\n\t\t\t\tdefinition above,\n\t\t\t\twherein the change of fortune occurs without \"reversal\" or \"discovery\";  by a complex action I mean one wherein the\n\t\t\t\tchange coincides with a \"discovery\" or \"reversal\" or both.  These should result from the actual structure of the\n\t\t\t\tplot in such a way that what has already happened makes the result inevitable or\n\t\t\t\t\tprobable;for there is indeed a vast\n\t\t\t\tdifference between what happens propter hoc and post hoc. A \"reversal\" is a\n\t\t\t\tchange of the situation into the opposite, as described above, this change being, moreover, as we are saying, probable or\n\t\t\t\t\tinevitable like the man\n\t\t\t\tin the  who came to cheer Oedipus and rid him of his anxiety\n\t\t\t\tabout his mother by revealing his parentage and changed the whole situation. In\n\t\t\t\tthe , too, there is the man led off to execution and\n\t\t\t\t\t Danaus following to kill him, and\n\t\t\t\tthe result of what had already happened was that the latter was killed and the\n\t\t\t\tformer escaped. A \"discovery,\" as the term itself implies, is a change from\n\t\t\t\tignorance to knowledge, producing either friendship or hatred in those who are\n\t\t\t\tdestined for good fortune or ill.  A\n\t\t\t\tdiscovery is most effective when it coincides with reversals, such as that involved\n\t\t\t\tby the discovery in the .  There are also other forms of discovery, for what we have\n\t\t\t\tdescribed may in a sense occur in relation to inanimate and trivial objects, or one\n\t\t\t\tmay discover whether some one has done something or not.  But the discovery which is most essentially part of the plot\n\t\t\t\tand part of the action is of the kind described above, for such a discovery and\n\t\t\t\treversal of fortune will involve either pity or fear, and it is actions such\n\t\t\t\tas these which, according to our hypothesis, tragedy represents; and, moreover,\n\t\t\t\tmisfortune and good fortune are likely to turn upon such incidents. Now since the\n\t\t\t\tdiscovery is somebody's discovery, in some scenes one character only is discovered\n\t\t\t\tto another, the identity of the other being obvious; but sometimes each must\n\t\t\t\tdiscover the other. Thus Iphigeneia was discovered to Orestes through the sending of\n\t\t\t\tthe letter, but a separate discovery was needed to make him known to\n\t\t\t\t\tIphigeneia. We see then that two\n\t\t\t\telements of the plot, reversal and discovery, turn upon these incidents. A third\n\t\t\t\telement is a calamity. Of these three elements we have already described reversal\n\t\t\t\tand discovery.  A calamity is a\n\t\t\t\tdestructive or painful occurrence, such as a death on the stage, acute suffering and\n\t\t\t\twounding and so on. We have already spoken of the constituent parts to be used as ingredients of tragedy.\n\t\t\t\tThe separable members into which it is quantitatively divided are these: Prologue,\n\t\t\t\tEpisode, Exode, Choral Song,  the last\n\t\t\t\tbeing divided into Parode and Stasimon.  These are common to all tragedies; songs sung by actors on the stage and \"commoi\"\n\t\t\t\tare peculiar to certain plays. A prologue is the whole of that part of a tragedy\n\t\t\t\twhich precedes the entrance of the chorus. An episode is the whole of that\n\t\t\t\tpart of a tragedy which falls between whole choral songs.  An exode is the whole of that part of a tragedy which is not\n\t\t\t\tfollowed by a song of the chorus.  A\n\t\t\t\tparode is the whole of the first utterance of the chorus.  A stasimon is a choral song without anapaests or\n\t\t\t\t\ttrochaics.\n\t\t\t\t A commos is a song of lament shared by\n\t\t\t\tthe chorus and the actors on the stage. The constituent parts to be used as\n\t\t\t\tingredients of tragedy have been described above; these are the separable members\n\t\t\t\tinto which it is quantitatively divided. Following upon what\n\t\t\t\thas been said above we should next state what ought to be aimed at and what avoided\n\t\t\t\tin the construction of a plot, and the means by which the object of tragedy may be\n\t\t\t\tachieved.  Since then the structure of\n\t\t\t\tthe best tragedy should be not simple but complex and one that represents incidents arousing fear and\n\t\t\t\tpityfor that is peculiar to this form of artit is obvious to\n\t\t\t\tbegin with that one should not show worthy men passing from good fortune to bad.\n\t\t\t\tThat does not arouse fear or pity but shocks our feelings.  Nor again wicked people passing from bad fortune to\n\t\t\t\tgood. That is the most untragic of all, having none of the requisite qualities,\n\t\t\t\tsince it does not satisfy our feelings or arouse pity or fear.  Nor again the passing of a thoroughly bad man\n\t\t\t\tfrom good fortune to bad fortune. Such a structure might satisfy our feelings but it\n\t\t\t\tarouses neither pity nor fear, the one being for the man who does not deserve his\n\t\t\t\tmisfortune and the other for the man who is like ourselvespity for the\n\t\t\t\tundeserved misfortune, fear for the man like ourselvesso that the result\n\t\t\t\twill arouse neither pity nor fear. There remains then the mean between these. This is the\n\t\t\t\tsort of man who is not pre-eminently virtous and just, and yet it is through no\n\t\t\t\tbadness or villainy of his own that he falls into the fortune, but rather through\n\t\t\t\tsome flaw in him, he\n\t\t\t\tbeing one of those who are in high station and good fortune, like Oedipus and\n\t\t\t\tThyestes and the famous men of such families as those.  The successful plot must then have a single and not, as some\n\t\t\t\tsay, a double issue; and the change must be not to good fortune from bad but, on the\n\t\t\t\tcontrary, from good to bad fortune, and it must not be due to villainy but to some\n\t\t\t\tgreat flaw in such a man as we have described, or of one who is better rather than\n\t\t\t\tworse.  This can be seen also in actual\n\t\t\t\tpractice. For at first poets accepted any plots, but to-day the best tragedies are\n\t\t\t\twritten about a few familiesAlcmaeon for instance and Oedipus and Orestes and Meleager and Thyestes and\n\t\t\t\tTelephus and all the others whom it befell to suffer or inflict terrible\n\t\t\t\t\tdisasters. Judged then by the theory of the art, the best tragedy is\n\t\t\t\tof this construction.  Those critics\n\t\t\t\tare therefore wrong who charge Euripides with doing this in his tragedies, and say\n\t\t\t\tthat many of his end in misfortune. \n\t\t\t\tThat is, as we have shown, correct. And there is very good evidence of this, for on\n\t\t\t\tthe stage and in competitions such plays appear the most tragic of all, if they are\n\t\t\t\tsuccessful, and even if Euripides is in other respects a bad manager, yet he is certainly the most tragic of the poets. Next in order comes\n\t\t\t\tthe structure which some put first, that which has a double issue, like the\n\t\t\t\t\t, and ends in opposite ways for the good characters and\n\t\t\t\tthe bad.  It is the sentimentality of\n\t\t\t\tthe audience which makes this seem the best form; for the poets follow the wish of\n\t\t\t\tthe spectators.  But this is not the\n\t\t\t\ttrue tragic pleasure but rather characteristic of comedy, where those who are bitter\n\t\t\t\tenemies in the story, Orestes and Aegisthus, for instance, go off at the end, having\n\t\t\t\tmade friends, and nobody kills anybody. Fear and pity sometimes result\n\t\t\t\tfrom the spectacle and are sometimes aroused by the actual arrangement of the\n\t\t\t\tincidents, which is preferable and the mark of a better poet.  The plot should be so constructed that even without\n\t\t\t\tseeing the play anyone hearing of the incidents happening thrills with fear and pity\n\t\t\t\tas a result of what occurs. So would anyone feel who heard the story of Oedipus.\n\t\t\t\t\t To produce this effect by means of\n\t\t\t\tan appeal to the eye is inartistic and needs adventitious aid,  while those who by such means produce an effect which\n\t\t\t\tis not fearful but merely monstrous have nothing in common with tragedy. For one should not seek from tragedy all kinds of pleasure but\n\t\t\t\tthat which is peculiar to tragedy,  and\n\t\t\t\tsince the poet must by \"representation\" produce the pleasure which comes from\n\t\t\t\tfeeling pity and fear, obviously this quality must be embodied in the\n\t\t\t\t\tincidents. We must now decide what incidents seem dreadful or rather\n\t\t\t\tpitiable. Such must necessarily be the actions of friends to each other or of\n\t\t\t\tenemies or of people that are neither. \n\t\t\t\tNow if an enemy does it to an enemy, there is nothing pitiable either in the deed or\n\t\t\t\tthe intention,  except so far as the\n\t\t\t\tactual calamity goes.  Nor would there\n\t\t\t\tbe if they were neither friends nor enemies. But when these calamities happen among\n\t\t\t\t\tfriends,when for instance brother\n\t\t\t\tkills brother, or son father, or mother son, or son mothereither kills or\n\t\t\t\tintends to kill, or does something of the kind, that is what we must look\n\t\t\t\t\tfor. Now it is not right to break up the traditional stories, I mean, for instance,\n\t\t\t\tClytaemnestra being killed by Orestes and Eriphyle by Alcmaeon,  but the poet must show invention and make a skilful\n\t\t\t\tuse of the tradition.But we must state more clearly\n\t\t\t\twhat is meant by \"skilful.\"  The\n\t\t\t\taction may happen in the way in which the old dramatists made their characters\n\t\t\t\tactconsciously and knowing the facts, as Euripides also\n\t\t\t\tmade his Medea kill her children.  Or\n\t\t\t\tthey may do the deed but without realizing the horror of it and then discover the\n\t\t\t\trelationship afterwards, like Oedipus in Sophocles. That indeed lies outside the\n\t\t\t\t\tplay, but an example of this in the tragedy itself is\n\t\t\t\tthe  of Astydamas or Telegonus in the .  A third\n\t\t\t\talternative is to intend to do some irremediable action in ignorance and to discover\n\t\t\t\tthe truth before doing it.  Besides\n\t\t\t\tthese there is no other way, for they must either do the deed or not, either knowing\n\t\t\t\tor unknowing.  The worst of these is\n\t\t\t\tto intend the action with full knowledge and not to perform it. That outrages the\n\t\t\t\tfeelings and is not tragic, for there is no calamity. So nobody does that,\n\t\t\t\texcept occasionally, as, for instance, Haemon and Creon in the\n\t\t\t\t\t.  Next\n\t\t\t\tcomes the doing of the deed.  It is\n\t\t\t\tbetter to act in ignorance and discover afterwards. Our feelings are not outraged\n\t\t\t\tand the discovery is startling.  Best\n\t\t\t\tof all is the last; in the , for instance, Merope intends\n\t\t\t\tto kill her son and does not kill him but discovers; and in the\n\t\t\t\t\t the case\n\t\t\t\tof the sister and brother; and in the  the son discovers just as he is on\n\t\t\t\tthe point of giving up his mother. So this is the reason, as was said\n\t\t\t\t\tabove, why tragedies are about a few families.\n\t\t\t\tFor in their experiments it was from no technical knowledge but purely by chance\n\t\t\t\tthat they found out how to produce such an effect in their stories. So they are\n\t\t\t\tobliged to have recourse to those families in which such calamities befell. Now concerning the structure of the incidents and the\n\t\t\t\tproper character of the plots enough has been said. Concerning \"character\" there are\n\t\t\t\tfour points to aim at. The first and most important is that the character should be\n\t\t\t\tgood.  The play will show character if,\n\t\t\t\tas we said above, either the dialogue or the actions\n\t\t\t\treveal some choice; and the character will be good, if the choice is good.\n\t\t\t\tBut this is relative to each class of people. Even a woman is \"good\" and so is a\n\t\t\t\tslave, although it may be said that a woman is an inferior thing and a slave beneath\n\t\t\t\t\tconsideration. The second point is that the characters should be\n\t\t\t\tappropriate. A character may be manly, but it is not appropriate for a woman to be\n\t\t\t\tmanly or clever. Thirdly, it should be \"like.\" This is different from making the\n\t\t\t\tcharacter good and from making it appropriate in the sense of the word as used\n\t\t\t\t\tabove. Fourthly, it should be consistent. Even if the original be inconsistent and\n\t\t\t\toffers such a character to the poet for representation, still he must be\n\t\t\t\tconsistently inconsistent. An example of unnecessary badness of character is Menelaos in\n\t\t\t\tthe ;  of character that is unfitting and inappropriate the lament\n\t\t\t\tof Odysseus in the  and Melanippe's speech;  of inconsistent character Iphigeneia in , for the suppliant Iphigeneia is not at\n\t\t\t\tall like her later character. In character-drawing just as much as in the\n\t\t\t\tarrangement of the incidents one should always seek what is inevitable or probable,\n\t\t\t\tso as to make it inevitable or probable that such and such a person should say or do\n\t\t\t\tsuch and such; and inevitable or probable that one thing should follow\n\t\t\t\t\tanother. Clearly therefore the \"denouement\" of each play should also be the result of\n\t\t\t\tthe plot itself and not produced mechanically as in the  and the\n\t\t\t\tincident of the embarkation in the Iliad. The\n\t\t\t\t\"god in the car\" should only be\n\t\t\t\tused to explain what lies outside the play, either what happened earlier and is\n\t\t\t\ttherefore beyond human knowledge, or what happens later and needs to be foretold in\n\t\t\t\ta proclamation. For we ascribe to the gods the power of seeing everything.\n\t\t\t\t\t There must, however, be nothing\n\t\t\t\tinexplicable in the incidents, or, if there is, it must lie outside the tragedy.\n\t\t\t\tThere is an example in Sophocles' . Since tragedy is a representation of men\n\t\t\t\tbetter than ourselves we must copy the good portrait-painters who, while rendering\n\t\t\t\tthe distinctive form and making a likeness, yet paint people better than they are.\n\t\t\t\tIt is the same with the poet. When representing people who are hot-tempered or lazy,\n\t\t\t\tor have other such traits of character, he should make them such, yet men of worth\n\t\t\t\tan example of hardness; take the way in which Agathon and Homer portray\n\t\t\t\t\tAchilles. Keep, then, a careful eye on these rules and also on the\n\t\t\t\tappeal to the eye which is necessarily bound up with the poet's business; for that\n\t\t\t\toffers many opportunities of going wrong. But this subject has been adequately\n\t\t\t\tdiscussed in the published treatises. What a \"Discovery\" is has been already stated.As for kinds of Discovery, first comes the least artistic kind,\n\t\t\t\twhich is largely used owing to incompetencediscovery by tokens.\n\t\t\t\t\t These may be congenital, like \"the\n\t\t\t\tspear the Earth-born bear\" or stars, like those which Carcinus uses in his\n\t\t\t\t\t;  or they may be acquired and these may be on the body, for\n\t\t\t\tinstance, wounds, or external things like necklaces, and in the\n\t\t\t\t\t the discovery by means of the boat.  There is a better and a worse way of using\n\t\t\t\tthese tokens; for instance Odysseus, by means of his wound, was discovered in one\n\t\t\t\tway by the nurse and in another way by the swine-herds.\n\t\t\t\t Discovery scenes constructed to prove\n\t\t\t\tthe point are inartistic and so are all such scenes, but those are better which\n\t\t\t\tarise out of a reversal scene, as, for instance, in \"The Washing.\"\n\t\t\t\t In the second place come those which\n\t\t\t\tare manufactured by the poet and are therefore inartistic. For instance, in the\n\t\t\t\t\t Orestes revealed himself. She was revealed to him\n\t\t\t\tthrough the letter,  but Orestes says\n\t\t\t\thimself what the poet wants and not what the plot requires. So this comes near to\n\t\t\t\tthe fault already mentioned, for he might just as well have actually brought some\n\t\t\t\t\ttokens. And there is \"the voice of the shuttle\" In Sophocles'\n\t\t\t\t\t. The third kind is due to memory, to showing distress on\n\t\t\t\tseeing something. An example of this is the scene in the  by\n\t\t\t\tDicaeogenes; on seeing the picture he burst into tears: and again in the \"Tale of Alcinous,\" hearing the minstrel he remembered and burst into tears; and thus they were\n\t\t\t\trecognized.  The fourth kind results\n\t\t\t\tfrom an inference; for instance, in the  \"Someone like me\n\t\t\t\thas come; but nobody is like me except Orestes; therefore he has come.\" And there is\n\t\t\t\t\tPolyidus's idea about Iphigeneia, for it\n\t\t\t\tis likely enough that Orestes should make an inference that, whereas his sister was\n\t\t\t\tsacrificed, here is the same thing happening to him. And in Theodectes'\n\t\t\t\t\t that \"having come to find a son, he is perishing himself.\"\n\t\t\t\tAnd the scene in the , where on seeing the spot the women\n\t\t\t\tinferred their fate, that they were meant to die there for it was there that they\n\t\t\t\thad been exposed. There is also a kind of\n\t\t\t\tfictitious discovery which depends on a false inference on the part of the audience,\n\t\t\t\tfor instance in , he said he would\n\t\t\t\trecognize the bow, which as a matter of fact he had not seen, but to assume that he\n\t\t\t\treally would reveal himself by this means is a false inference. Best of all is the discovery which is\n\t\t\t\tbrought about directly by the incidents, the surprise being produced by means of\n\t\t\t\twhat is likelytake the scene in Sophocles'  or in\n\t\t\t\tthe for it is likely enough that she should want\n\t\t\t\tto send a letter. These are the only discovery scenes which dispense with artificial\n\t\t\t\ttokens, like necklaces. In the second place come those\n\t\t\t\tthat are the result of inference. In constructing plots and completing the effect by the\n\t\t\t\thelp of dialogue the poet should, as far as possible, keep the scene before his\n\t\t\t\teyes. Only thus by getting the picture as clear as if he were present at the actual\n\t\t\t\tevent, will he find what is fitting and detect contradictions.  The censure upon Carcinos is evidence of this.\n\t\t\t\tAmphiaraos was was made to rise from a temple. The poet did not visualize the scene\n\t\t\t\tand therefore this escaped his notice, but on the stage it was a failure since the\n\t\t\t\taudience objected.\n\t\t\t\t The poet should also, as far as\n\t\t\t\tpossible, complete the effect by using the gestures. For, if their natural powers\n\t\t\t\tare equal, those who are actually in the emotions are the most convincing; he who is\n\t\t\t\tagitated blusters and the angry man rages with the maximum of conviction.\n\t\t\t\t And that is why poetry needs either a\n\t\t\t\tsympathetic nature or a madman, the former being impressionable and the latter inspired. The stories,\n\t\t\t\twhether they are traditional or whether you make them up yourself, should first\n\t\t\t\tbe sketched in outline and then expanded by putting in episodes.  I mean that one might look at the general outline, say\n\t\t\t\tof the , like this: A certain maiden has been sacrificed,\n\t\t\t\tand has disappeared beyond the ken of those who sacrificed her and has been\n\t\t\t\testablished in another country, where it is a custom to sacrifice strangers to the\n\t\t\t\tgoddess; and this priesthood she holds. Some time afterwards it happens that the\n\t\t\t\tbrother of the priestess arrives therethe fact that the god told him to\n\t\t\t\tgo there, and why, and the object of his journey, lie outside the outline-plot. He\n\t\t\t\tarrives, is seized, and is on the point of being sacrificed, when he reveals his\n\t\t\t\tidentity either by Euripides' method or according to Polyidos, by making the very\n\t\t\t\tnatural remark that after all it is not only his sister who was born to be\n\t\t\t\tsacrificed but himself too; and thus he is saved.  Not until this has been done should you put in names and\n\t\t\t\tinsert the episodes;  and you must mind\n\t\t\t\tthat the episodes are appropriate, as, for instance, in the case of Orestes the\n\t\t\t\tmadness that led to his capture and his escape by means of the purification. Now in drama the episodes are short, but it is by them that\n\t\t\t\tthe epic gains its length.  The story\n\t\t\t\tof the Odyssey is quite short. A man is for many years away from home and his\n\t\t\t\tfootsteps are dogged by Poseidon and he is all alone. Moreover,affairs at home are in such a state that his estate is\n\t\t\t\tbeing wasted by suitors and a plot laid against his son, but after being\n\t\t\t\tstorm-tossed he arrives himself, reveals who he is, and attacks them, with the\n\t\t\t\tresult that he is saved and destroys his enemies.  That is the essence, the rest is episodes. In every tragedy\n\t\t\t\tthere is a complication and a denouement. The\n\t\t\t\tincidents outside the plot and some of those in it usually form the complication,\n\t\t\t\tthe rest is the denouement.  I mean\n\t\t\t\tthis, that the complication is the part from the beginning up to the point which\n\t\t\t\timmediately precedes the occurrence of a change from bad to good fortune or from\n\t\t\t\tgood fortune to bad; the denouement is from the beginning of the change down to the\n\t\t\t\tend.  For instance, in the\n\t\t\t\t\t of Theodectes the complication is the preceding events,\n\t\t\t\tand the seizure of the boy, and then their own seizure; and the denouement is from\n\t\t\t\tthe capital charge to the end. Tragedies should properly be classed as the same or\n\t\t\t\tdifferent mainly in virtue of the plot, that is to say those that have the same\n\t\t\t\tentanglement and denouement. Many who entangle well are bad at the denouement. Both\n\t\t\t\tshould always be mastered.There are four varieties of\n\t\t\t\ttragedythe same as the number given for the \"elements\" first the\n\t\t\t\tcomplex kind, which all turns on reversal and discovery;  the \"calamity play\" like the stories of Ajax and Ixion;\n\t\t\t\t\t the \"character play\" like the\n\t\t\t\t\t and the .  The fourth element is spectacle, like the\n\t\t\t\t\t and , and all scenes laid in Hades.\n\t\t\t\t\t One should ideally try to include\n\t\t\t\tall these elements or, failing that, the most important and as many as possible,\n\t\t\t\tespecially since it is the modern fashion to carp at poets, and, because there have\n\t\t\t\tbeen good poets in each style, to demand that a single author should surpass the\n\t\t\t\tpeculiar merits of each. One must remember, as we have often said, not to make a\n\t\t\t\ttragedy an epic structure:  by epic I\n\t\t\t\tmean made up of many storiessuppose, for instance, one were to dramatize\n\t\t\t\tthe  as a whole. \n\t\t\t\tThe length of the  allows to the parts their proper size, but in\n\t\t\t\tplays the result is full of disappointment.  And the proof is that all who have dramatized the Sack of\n\t\t\t\t\t as a whole, and not, like\n\t\t\t\tEuripides, piecemeal, or the Niobe story as a whole and not like Aeschylus, either\n\t\t\t\tfail or fare badly in competition. Indeed even Agathon failed in this point alone.\n\t\t\t\t\t In \"reversals,\" however, and in\n\t\t\t\t\"simple\" stories too,they admirably achieve their end, which is a tragic\n\t\t\t\teffect that also satisfies your feelings.  This is achieved when the wise man, who is, however,\n\t\t\t\tunscrupulous, is deceivedlike Sisyphusand the man who is brave\n\t\t\t\tbut wicked is worsted.  And this, as\n\t\t\t\tAgathon says, is a likely result, since it is likely that many quite unlikely things\n\t\t\t\tshould happen. The chorus too must be regarded as one of the actors. It must\n\t\t\t\tbe part of the whole and share in the action, not as in Euripides but as in\n\t\t\t\tSophocles.  In the others the choral\n\t\t\t\todes have no more to do with the plot than with any other tragedy. And so they sing\n\t\t\t\tinterludes, a practice begun by Agathon. And yet to sing interludes is quite as bad\n\t\t\t\tas transferring a whole speech or scene from one play to another. The other factors\n\t\t\t\thave been already discussed. It remains to speak of \"Diction\" and \"Thought.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t All that concerns Thought may be\n\t\t\t\tleft to the treatise on Rhetoric, for the subject is more proper to that\n\t\t\t\t\tinquiry.\n\t\t\t\t Under the head of Thought come all the\n\t\t\t\teffects to be produced by the language.  Some of these are proof and refutation, the arousing of feelings like pity,\n\t\t\t\tfear, anger, and so on, and then again exaggeration and depreciation.\n\t\t\t\t It is clear that in the case of the\n\t\t\t\tincidents, too, one should work on the same principles, when effects of pity or\n\t\t\t\tterror or exaggeration or probability have to be produced.  There is just this difference, that some effects must\n\t\t\t\tbe clear without explanation, whereas others are produced in the speeches by the speaker\n\t\t\t\tand are due to the speeches. For what would be the use of a speaker, if the required\n\t\t\t\teffect were likely to be felt without the aid of the speeches? Under the head of\n\t\t\t\tDiction one subject of inquiry is the various modes of speech, the knowledge of\n\t\t\t\twhich is proper to elocution or to the man who knows the master artI mean for\n\t\t\t\tinstance, what is a command, a prayer, a statement, a threat, question, answer, and\n\t\t\t\tso on.  The knowledge or ignorance of\n\t\t\t\tsuch matters brings upon the poet no censure worth serious consideration. For who\n\t\t\t\tcould suppose that there is any fault in the passage which Protagoras censures,\n\t\t\t\tbecause Homer, intending to utter a prayer, gives a command when he says, \"Sing,\n\t\t\t\tgoddess, the wrath\"? To order something to be done or not is, he points out, a\n\t\t\t\t\tcommand. So we may leave this topic as one that belongs not to poetry\n\t\t\t\tbut to another art. Diction as a\n\t\t\t\t\twhole is made up of these parts: letter, syllable,\n\t\t\t\tconjunction, joint,\n\t\t\t\tnoun, verb, case, phrase.  A letter is\n\t\t\t\tan indivisible sound, not every such sound but one of which an intelligible sound\n\t\t\t\tcan be formed. Animals utter indivisible sounds but none that I should call a\n\t\t\t\tletter.  Such sounds may be subdivided\n\t\t\t\tinto vowel, semi-vowel, and mute. A vowel is that which without any addition has an\n\t\t\t\taudible sound; a semivowel needs the addition of another letter to give it audible\n\t\t\t\tsound, for instance S and R; a mute is that which with addition has no sound of its\n\t\t\t\town but becomes audible when combined with some of the letters which have a sound.\n\t\t\t\tExamples of mutes are G and D.  Letters\n\t\t\t\tdiffer according to the shape of the mouth and the place at which they are sounded;\n\t\t\t\tin being with or without aspiration; in being long and short; and lastly in having\n\t\t\t\tan acute, grave, or intermediate accent. But the detailed study of these matters\n\t\t\t\tproperly concerns students of metre. A syllable is a sound without meaning,\n\t\t\t\tcomposed of a mute and a letter that has a sound. GR, for example, without A is a\n\t\t\t\tsyllable just as much as GRA with an A. But these distinctions also belong to the\n\t\t\t\ttheory of metre. words. It is also very obscure. Students should refer to Bywater's\n\t\t\t\t\tedition. A conjunction is a sound without meaning, which\n\t\t\t\tneither hinders nor causes the formation of a single significant sound or phrase out\n\t\t\t\tof several sounds, and which, if the phrase stands by itself, cannot properly stand\n\t\t\t\tat the beginning of it, e.g. ;\n\t\t\t\tor else it is a sound without meaning capable of forming one significant sound or\n\t\t\t\tphrase out of several sounds having each a meaning of their own, e.g. . A joint is a sound without meaning which\n\t\t\t\tmarks the beginning or end of a phrase or a division in it, and naturally stands at\n\t\t\t\teither end or in the middle. A noun is a\n\t\t\t\tcomposite sound with a meaning, not indicative of time, no part of which has a\n\t\t\t\tmeaning by itself; for in compounds we do not use each part as having a meaning of\n\t\t\t\tits own, for instance, in \"Theodorus,\" there is no meaning of  gift. A verb is a composite sound with\n\t\t\t\ta meaning, indicative of time, no part of which has a meaning by\n\t\t\t\titselfjust as in nouns. \"Man\" or \"white\" does not signify time, but\n\t\t\t\t\"walks\" and \"has walked\" connote present and past time respectively. A\n\t\t\t\tcaseor inflectionof a noun or verb is that which signifies\n\t\t\t\teither \"of\" or \"to\" a thing and the like;or gives the sense of \"one or many\" e.g. men and man; or else it may depend on the\n\t\t\t\tdelivery, for example question and command. \"Walked?\" and \"Walk!\" are verbal \"cases\"\n\t\t\t\tof this kind. A phrase is a composite sound with a\n\t\t\t\tmeaning, some parts of which mean something by themselves.  It is not true to say that every \"phrase\" is made up\n\t\t\t\tof nouns and verbs, e.g. the definition of man; but although\n\t\t\t\tit is possible to have a \"phrase\" without verbs, yet some part of it will always\n\t\t\t\thave a meaning of its own, for example, Cleon in \"Cleon walks.\"  A \"phrase\" may be a unit in two ways; either it\n\t\t\t\tsignifies one thing or it is a combination of several \"phrases.\" The unity of the\n\t\t\t\t\t, for instance, is due to such combination, but the\n\t\t\t\tdefinition of man is \"one phrase\" because it signifies one thing. Nouns are of two\n\t\t\t\tkinds. There is the simple noun, by which I mean one made up of parts that have no\n\t\t\t\tmeaning, like , and there is the compound noun.\n\t\t\t\t\t These may be made up either of a\n\t\t\t\tpart which has no meaning and a part which has a meaningthough it does\n\t\t\t\tnot have its meaning in the compoundor of two parts both having a\n\t\t\t\tmeaning.  A compound noun may be triple\n\t\t\t\tand quadruple and multiple, e.g. many of the bombastic names like\n\t\t\t\t\tHermocaicoxanthus.\n\t\t\t\t . .\n\t\t\t\t.  Every noun is either \"ordinary\" or \"rare\" or \"metaphorical\" or \"ornamental\" or\n\t\t\t\t\"invented\" or \"lengthened\" or \"curtailed\" or \"altered.\"  An \"ordinary\" word is one used by everybody, a \"rare\" word\n\t\t\t\tone used by some;  so that a word may\n\t\t\t\tobviously be both \"ordinary\" and \"rare,\" but not in relation to the same people.\n\t\t\t\t\t, for instance, is to the Cypriots an \"ordinary\" word\n\t\t\t\tbut to us a \"rare\" one. Metaphor is the application of a strange term either\n\t\t\t\ttransferred from the genus and applied to the species or from the species and\n\t\t\t\tapplied to the genus, or from one species to another or else by analogy.  An example of a term transferred from genus\n\t\t\t\tto species is \"Here stands my ship.\" Riding at anchor is a species of standing.\n\t\t\t\t\t An example of transference from\n\t\t\t\tspecies to genus is \"Indeed ten thousand noble things Odysseus did,\" for ten\n\t\t\t\tthousand, which is a species of many, is here used instead of the word \"many.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t An example of transference from\n\t\t\t\tone species to another is \"Drawing off his life with the bronze\" and \"Severing with\n\t\t\t\tthe tireless bronze,\" where \"drawing off\" is used for \"severing\" and \"severing\" for\n\t\t\t\t\"drawing off,\" both being species of \"removing.\" Metaphor by analogy\n\t\t\t\tmeans this: when B is to A as D is to C, then instead of B the poet will say D and B\n\t\t\t\tinstead of D.  And sometimes they add\n\t\t\t\tthat to which the term supplanted by the metaphor is relative.For instance, a cup\n\t\t\t\tis to Dionysus what a shield is to Ares;  so he will call the cup \"Dionysus's shield\" and the shield\n\t\t\t\t\"Ares' cup.\" Or old age is to life as evening is to day; so he will call the evening\n\t\t\t\t\"day's old-age\" or use Empedocles' phrase; and old age he will call \"the evening of life\" or \"life's setting\n\t\t\t\tsun.\"  Sometimes there is no word for\n\t\t\t\tsome of the terms of the analogy but the metaphor can be used all the same. For\n\t\t\t\tinstance, to scatter seed is to sow, but there is no word for the action of the sun\n\t\t\t\tin scattering its fire. Yet this has to the sunshine the same relation as sowing has\n\t\t\t\tto the seed, and so you have the phrase \"sowing the god-created fire.\" Besides this\n\t\t\t\tanother way of employing metaphor is to call a thing by the strange name and then to\n\t\t\t\tdeny it some attribute of that name. For instance, suppose you call the shield not\n\t\t\t\t\"Ares' cup\" but a wineless cup. . . . . . . An invented\n\t\t\t\tword is one not used at all by any people and coined by the poet. There seem to be\n\t\t\t\tsuch words, eg. \"sprouters\" for horns and \"pray-er\" for priest. A word is\n\t\t\t\t\"lengthened\" or \"curtailed,\" the former when use is made of a longer vowel than\n\t\t\t\tusual or a syllable inserted, and the latter when part of the word is curtailed.\n\t\t\t\t\t An example of a lengthened word\n\t\t\t\tis  for  and  for ; and of a curtailed word  and , and e.g. . A word is \"altered\" when the poet coins part of the word and\n\t\t\t\tleaves the rest unchanged, e.g.  instead of . Of the nouns\n\t\t\t\tthemselves, some are masculine, some feminine, and some neuter.\n\t\t\t\t Masculine are all that end in N and P\n\t\t\t\tand  and in the two compounds of  and .  Feminine are all that end in those of the\n\t\t\t\tvowels that are always long, for instance  and\n\t\t\t\t\t, and in \n\t\t\t\tamong vowels that can be lengthened. \n\t\t\t\tThe result is that the number of masculine and feminine terminations is the same,\n\t\t\t\tfor  and  are\n\t\t\t\tthe same as .  No noun ends in a mute or in a short vowel.  Only three end in , and . Five end\n\t\t\t\tin . The neuters end in these letters and in\n\t\t\t\t\t and . The merit of diction is to be clear and not commonplace. The\n\t\t\t\tclearest diction is that made up of ordinary words, but it is commonplace. An\n\t\t\t\texample is the poetry of Cleophon and of Sthenelus.\n\t\t\t\t That which employs unfamiliar words is\n\t\t\t\tdignified and outside the common usage. By \"unfamiliar\" I mean a rare word, a\n\t\t\t\tmetaphor, a lengthening, and anything beyond the ordinary use.  But if a poet writes entirely in such words, the result will\n\t\t\t\tbe either a riddle or jargon; if made up of metaphors, a riddle and if of rare\n\t\t\t\twords, jargon.  The essence of a riddle\n\t\t\t\tconsists in describing a fact by an impossible combination of words. By merely\n\t\t\t\tcombining the ordinary names of things this cannot be done, but it is made possible\n\t\t\t\tby combining metaphors. For instance, \"I saw a man weld bronze upon a man with\n\t\t\t\tfire,\" and so on.\n\t\t\t\t A medley of rare words is jargon.\n\t\t\t\t\t We need then a sort of mixture of\n\t\t\t\tthe two. For the one kind will save the diction from being prosaic and commonplace,\n\t\t\t\tthe rare word, for example, and the metaphor and the \"ornament,\" whereas the\n\t\t\t\tordinary words give clarity. A considerable aid to clarity and distinction are the\n\t\t\t\tlengthening and abbreviation and alteration of words. Being otherwise than in the\n\t\t\t\tordinary form and thus unusual, these will produce the effect of distinction, and\n\t\t\t\tclarity will be preserved by retaining part of the usual form.  Those critics are therefore wrong who censure this\n\t\t\t\tmanner of idiom and poke fun at the poet, as did the elder Eucleides who said it was easy to write poetry, granted the\n\t\t\t\tright to lengthen syllables at will. He had made a burlesque in this very style:\n\t\t\t\t\t and\n\t\t\t\t\t. Now to make an obtrusive use of this licence is ridiculous;\n\t\t\t\t\t but moderation is a requisite\n\t\t\t\tcommon to all kinds of writing. The same effect could be got by using metaphors and\n\t\t\t\trare words and the rest unsuitably for the express purpose of raising a\n\t\t\t\t\tlaugh. What a difference is made by the proper use of such licence\n\t\t\t\tmay be seen in epic poetry, if you substitute in the verse the ordinary forms.\n\t\t\t\t\t Take a rare word or metaphor or\n\t\t\t\tany of the others and substitute the ordinary word; the truth of our contention will\n\t\t\t\tthen be obvious.For instance, Aeschylus\n\t\t\t\tand Euripides wrote the same iambic line with the change of one word only, a rare\n\t\t\t\tword in place of one made ordinary by custom, yet the one line seems beautiful and\n\t\t\t\tthe other trivial. Aeschylus in the  wrote, \"The ulcer\n\t\t\t\teats the flesh of this my foot,\" and Euripides instead of \"eats\" put \"feasts upon.\"\n\t\t\t\tOr take \"I that am small, of no account nor goodly;\" suppose one were to read the\n\t\t\t\tline substituting the ordinary words, \"I that am little and weak and ugly.\" Or\n\t\t\t\tcompare \"He set a stool unseemly and a table small.\" with \"He set a shabby stool and\n\t\t\t\ta little table,\" or \"the sea-shore is roaring\" with \"the sea-shore is\n\t\t\t\t\tshrieking.\" Ariphrades\n\t\t\t\tagain made fun of the tragedians because they employ phrases which no one would use\n\t\t\t\tin conversation, like \" \" instead of\n\t\t\t\t\t and their \" \"and \" \"and \"\n\t\t\t\t\t\" for , and so on.  All that sort of thing, not being in the ordinary form, gives\n\t\t\t\tdistinction to the diction, which was what he failed to understand. It is a great thing\n\t\t\t\tto make a proper use of each of the elements mentioned, and of double words and rare\n\t\t\t\twords too, but by far the greatest thing is the use of metaphor.  That alone cannot be learnt; it is the token\n\t\t\t\tof genius. For the right use of metaphor means an eye for resemblances. Of the various kinds of words the double forms are most\n\t\t\t\tsuited for dithyrambs, rare words for heroic verse and metaphors for iambics.\n\t\t\t\t\t And indeed in heroic verse they\n\t\t\t\tare all useful; but since iambic verse is largely an imitation of speech, only those\n\t\t\t\tnouns are suitable which might be used in talking. These are the ordinary word,\n\t\t\t\tmetaphor, and \"ornament.\" Now concerning tragedy and the art of representing life in\n\t\t\t\taction, what we have said already must suffice. We come now to the art of\n\t\t\t\trepresentation which is narrative and in metre. Clearly the story must be constructed as in tragedy,\n\t\t\t\tdramatically, round a single piece of action, whole and complete in\n\t\t\t\t\titself,with a beginning, middle and\n\t\t\t\tend, so that like a single living organism it may produce its own peculiar form of\n\t\t\t\tpleasure.  It must not be such as we\n\t\t\t\tnormally find in history, where what is required is an exposition not of a single\n\t\t\t\tpiece of action but of a single period of time, showing all that within the period\n\t\t\t\tbefell one or more persons, events that have a merely casual relation to each other.\n\t\t\t\t\t For just as the battle of\n\t\t\t\t\t occurred at the same time as\n\t\t\t\tthe Carthaginian battle in , but they\n\t\t\t\tdo not converge to the same result;\n\t\t\t\tso, too, in any sequence of time one event may follow another and yet they may not\n\t\t\t\tissue in any one result.  Yet most of\n\t\t\t\tthe poets do this.  So in this respect,\n\t\t\t\ttoo, compared with all other poets Homer may seem, as we have already said, divinely\n\t\t\t\tinspired, in that even with the Trojan war, which has a beginning and an end, he did\n\t\t\t\tnot endeavor to dramatize it as a whole, since it would have been either too long to\n\t\t\t\tbe taken in all at once or, if he had moderated the length, he would have\n\t\t\t\tcomplicated it by the variety of incident. As it is, he takes one part of the story\n\t\t\t\tonly and uses many incidents from other parts, such as the Catalogue of Ships and\n\t\t\t\tother incidents with which he diversifies his poetry.  The others, on the contrary, all write about a single hero or\n\t\t\t\tabout a single period or about a single action with a great many parts, the authors,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example, of the  and the .\n\t\t\t\t The result is that out of an\n\t\t\t\t\t or an  only one tragedy can be made,\n\t\t\t\tor two at most, whereas several have been made out of the , and\n\t\t\t\tout of the  more than eight, e.g. , , ,\n\t\t\t\t\t, , , , and , and\n\t\t\t\t\t, too, and  The next point is\n\t\t\t\tthat there must be the same varieties of epic as of tragedy: an epic must be \"simple or complex,\" or else turn on \"character\" or on \"calamity.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t The constituent parts, too, are\n\t\t\t\tthe same with the exception of song and spectacle. Epic needs reversals and\n\t\t\t\tdiscoveries and calamities, and the thought and diction too must be good.  All these were used by Homer for the first\n\t\t\t\ttime, and used well. Of his poems he made the one, the , a \"simple\" story turning on \"calamity,\" and the  a\n\t\t\t\t\"complex\" storyit is full of \"discoveries\"turning on\n\t\t\t\tcharacter. Besides this they surpass all other poems in diction and\n\t\t\t\t\tthought. Epic differs from tragedy in the length of the composition\n\t\t\t\tand in metre.  The limit of length\n\t\t\t\talready given will sufficeit must be\n\t\t\t\tpossible to embrace the beginning and the end in one view,which would be the case if the compositions were\n\t\t\t\tshorter than the ancient epics but reached to the length of the tragedies presented\n\t\t\t\tat a single entertainment.\n\t\t\t\t Epic has a special advantage which\n\t\t\t\tenables the length to be increased, because in tragedy it is not possible to\n\t\t\t\trepresent several parts of the story as going on simultaneously, but only to show\n\t\t\t\twhat is on the stage, that part of the story which the actors are performing;\n\t\t\t\twhereas, in the epic, because it is narrative, several parts can be portrayed as\n\t\t\t\tbeing enacted at the same time.  If\n\t\t\t\tthese incidents are relevant, they increase the bulk of the poem, and this increase\n\t\t\t\tgives the epic a great advantage in richness as well as the variety due to the\n\t\t\t\tdiverse incidents; for it is monotony which, soon satiating the audience, makes\n\t\t\t\ttragedies fail. Experience has shown that the heroic hexameter is the right\n\t\t\t\tmetre. Were anyone to write a narrative poem in any other metre or in several\n\t\t\t\tmetres, the effect would be wrong.  The\n\t\t\t\thexameter is the most sedate and stately of all metres and therefore admits of rare\n\t\t\t\twords and metaphors more than others, and narrative poetry is itself elaborate above\n\t\t\t\tall others.  The iambic and the\n\t\t\t\ttrochaic tetrameter are lively, the latter suits dancing and the former suits real\n\t\t\t\tlife.  Still more unsuitable is it to\n\t\t\t\tuse several metres as Chaeremon did. \n\t\t\t\tSo no one has composed a long poem in any metre other than the heroic hexameter. As\n\t\t\t\twe said above, Nature shows that this is the right metre to choose. Homer deserves\n\t\t\t\tpraise for many things and especially for this, that alone of all poets he does not\n\t\t\t\tfail to understand what he ought to do himself. The poet should speak as seldom as\n\t\t\t\tpossible in his own character, since he is not \"representing\" the story in that\n\t\t\t\t\tsense.\n\t\t\t\t Now the other poets play a part\n\t\t\t\tthemselves throughout the poem and only occasionally \"represent\" a few things\n\t\t\t\tdramatically, but Homer after a brief prelude at once brings in a man or a woman or\n\t\t\t\tsome other character, never without character, but all having character of their\n\t\t\t\t\town. Now the marvellous should certainly be portrayed in tragedy, but epic affords\n\t\t\t\tgreater scope for the inexplicablewhich is the chief element in what is\n\t\t\t\tmarvellous, because we do not actually see the persons of the story.\n\t\t\t\t\t The incident of\n\t\t\t\t\tHector's pursuit would look ridiculous\n\t\t\t\ton the stage, the people standing still and not pursuing and Achilles waving them\n\t\t\t\tback, but in epic that is not noticed.  But that the marvellous causes pleasure is shown by the fact that people always\n\t\t\t\ttell a piece of news with additions by way of being agreeable. Above all, Homer has\n\t\t\t\ttaught the others the proper way of telling lies,that is, by using a fallacy. When B is true if A is true, or B\n\t\t\t\thappens if A happens, people think that if B is true A must be true or happen. But\n\t\t\t\tthat is false. Consequently if A be untrue but there be something else, B, which is\n\t\t\t\tnecessarily true or happens if A is true, the proper thing to do is to posit B, for,\n\t\t\t\tknowing B to be true, our mind falsely infers that A is true also. This is an\n\t\t\t\texample from the Washing. What is convincing\n\t\t\t\tthough impossible should always be preferred to what is possible and unconvincing.\n\t\t\t\t\t Stories should not be made up of\n\t\t\t\tinexplicable details; so far as possible there should be nothing inexplicable, or,\n\t\t\t\tif there is, it should lie outside the storyas, for instance, Oedipus not\n\t\t\t\tknowing how Laius diedand not in the play; for example, in the\n\t\t\t\t\t the news of the Pythian games, or in the Mysians the man who came from\n\t\t\t\t\t to  without speaking. To say that the plot would otherwise have been ruined is\n\t\t\t\tridiculous.  One should not in the\n\t\t\t\tfirst instance construct such a plot, and if a poet does write thus, and there seems\n\t\t\t\tto be a more reasonable way of treating the incident, then it is positively absurd.\n\t\t\t\t\t Even in the\n\t\t\t\t\t the inexplicable elements in the story of his\n\t\t\t\t\tlanding would obviously have been intolerable, had they been written by\n\t\t\t\tan inferior poet. As it is, Homer conceals the absurdity by the charm of all his\n\t\t\t\tother merits. The diction should be elaborated only in the \"idle\" parts\n\t\t\t\twhich do not reveal character or thought. Too brilliant diction frustrates its\n\t\t\t\town object by diverting attention from the portrayal of character and\n\t\t\t\t\tthought. With regard to problems, and the various solutions\n\t\t\t\tof them, how many kinds there are, and the nature of each kind, all will be clear if\n\t\t\t\twe look at them like this.  Since the\n\t\t\t\tpoet represents life, as a painter does or any other maker of likenesses, he must\n\t\t\t\talways represent one of three thingseither things as they were or are; or\n\t\t\t\tthings as they are said and seem to be; or things as they should be.  These are expressed in diction with or\n\t\t\t\twithout rare words and metaphors, there being many modifications of diction, all of\n\t\t\t\twhich we allow the poet to use. \n\t\t\t\tMoreover, the standard of what is correct is not the same in the art of poetry as it\n\t\t\t\tis in the art of social conduct or any other art.  In the actual art of poetry there are two kinds of errors,\n\t\t\t\tessential and accidental.  If a man\n\t\t\t\tmeant to represent something and failed through incapacity, that is an essential\n\t\t\t\terror. But if his error is due to his original conception being wrong and his\n\t\t\t\tportraying, for example, a horse advancing both its right legs, that is then a\n\t\t\t\ttechnical error in some special branch of knowledge,in medicine, say, or whatever it may be; or else some sort of\n\t\t\t\timpossibility has been portrayed, but that is not an essential error.  These considerations must, then, be kept in\n\t\t\t\tview in meeting the charges contained in these objections.Let us first take the charges against the art of poetry itself. If\n\t\t\t\tan impossibility has been portrayed, an error has been made.  But it is justifiable if the poet thus achieves the\n\t\t\t\tobject of poetrywhat that is has been already statedand makes\n\t\t\t\tthat part or some other part of the poem more striking. The pursuit of\n\t\t\t\t\tHector is an example of this.\n\t\t\t\t If, however, the object could have\n\t\t\t\tbeen achieved better or just as well without sacrifice of technical accuracy, then\n\t\t\t\tit is not justifiable, for, if possible, there should be no error at all in any part\n\t\t\t\tof the poem.  Again one must ask of\n\t\t\t\twhich kind is the error, is it an error in poetic art or a chance error in some\n\t\t\t\tother field? It is less of an error not to know that a female stag has no horns than\n\t\t\t\tto make a picture that is unrecognizable. Next, supposing the charge is \"That is not\n\t\t\t\ttrue,\" one can meet it by saying \"But perhaps it ought to be,\" just as Sophocles\n\t\t\t\tsaid that he portrayed people as they ought to be and Euripides portrayed them as\n\t\t\t\tthey are.  If neither of these will\n\t\t\t\tdo, then say, \"Such is the tale\"; for instance, tales about gods.  Very likely there is no advantage in telling\n\t\t\t\tthem, and they are not true either, but may well be what Xenophanes declaredall the same such is the tale.  In another case, perhaps, there is no\n\t\t\t\tadvantage but \"such was the fact,\" e.g. the case of the arms, \"Their spears erect on\n\t\t\t\tbutt-spikes stood,\" for that was then the\n\t\t\t\tcustom, as it still is in . As to the question whether anything that has been said or\n\t\t\t\tdone is morally good or bad, this must be answered not merely by seeing whether what\n\t\t\t\thas actually been done or said is noble or base, but by taking into consideration\n\t\t\t\talso the man who did or said it, and seeing to whom he did or said it, and when and\n\t\t\t\tfor whom and for what reason; for example, to secure a greater good or to avoid a\n\t\t\t\tgreater evil. Some objections may be met by reference to the diction, for\n\t\t\t\texample, by pleading \"rare word,\" e.g. , for perhaps he means not mules but sentinels. And Dolon, \"One that was\n\t\t\t\tverily evil of form,\" it may be not his deformed body but his ugly face, for the\n\t\t\t\tCretans use \"fair-formed\" for \"fair-featured.\" And again \"Livelier\n\t\t\t\tmix it\" may mean not undiluted as for drunkards but quicker.\n\t\t\t\t Other expressions are metaphorical,\n\t\t\t\tfor example: Then all the other immortals and men lay all night in slumber,\" while\n\t\t\t\tyet he says: \"Yea, when indeed he gazed at the Trojan plain Agamemnon Marvelled at\n\t\t\t\tvoices of flutes . . .\" \"All\" is used\n\t\t\t\tinstead of \"many\" metaphorically, \"all\" being a species of \"many.\" And again, \"Alone unsharing \" is metaphorical; the best known is\n\t\t\t\tcalled the only one. By intonation also; for example, the solutions of Hippias of\n\t\t\t\t\t, his \" \" and ;\n\t\t\t\t\t and by punctuation; for example,\n\t\t\t\tthe lines of Empedocles: Soon mortal grow they that aforetime learnt Immortal ways,\n\t\t\t\tand pure erstwhile commingled.\n\t\t\t\t Or again by ambiguity, e.g. , where  is ambiguous. Others\n\t\t\t\taccording to the habitual use of the phrase, e.g. wine and water is called \"wine\" so\n\t\t\t\tyou get the phrase \"greaves of new-wrought tin\"; or\n\t\t\t\tworkers in iron are called \"braziers,\" and so Ganymede is said to pour wine for\n\t\t\t\tZeus, though they do not drink wine. This last might however be metaphorical. Whenever a word seems to involve a contradiction, one should\n\t\t\t\tconsider how many different meanings it might bear in the passage, e.g. in \"There\n\t\t\t\tthe bronzen shaft was stayed,\" we should ask in\n\t\t\t\thow many ways \"being stayed\" might be taken,  interpreting the passage in this sense or in that, and\n\t\t\t\tkeeping as far as possible from the attitude which Glaucon describes  when he\n\t\t\t\tsays that people make some unwarrantable presupposition and having themselves given\n\t\t\t\tan adverse verdict proceed to argue from it, and if what they think the poet has\n\t\t\t\tsaid does not agree with their own preconceived ideas, they censure him, as if that\n\t\t\t\twas what he had said.  This is what\n\t\t\t\thas happened in the case of Icarius. They assume that he was a Spartan and therefore find it odd that\n\t\t\t\twhen Telemachus went to  he did not\n\t\t\t\tmeet him. But the truth may be, as the Cephallenians say, that Odysseus married a\n\t\t\t\twife from their country and that the name was not Icarius but Icadius. So the\n\t\t\t\tobjection is probably due to a mistake. In general any \"impossibility\" may be\n\t\t\t\tdefended by reference to the poetic effect or to the ideal or to current opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t For poetic effect a convincing\n\t\t\t\timpossibility is preferable to that which is unconvincing though possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t It may be impossible that there\n\t\t\t\tshould be such people as Zeuxis used to paint,\n\t\t\t\tbut it would be better if there were; for the type should improve on the\n\t\t\t\t\tactual. Popular tradition may be used to defend what seems\n\t\t\t\tirrational, and you can also say that sometimes it is not irrational, for it is\n\t\t\t\tlikely that unlikely things should happen.  Contradictions in terms must be examined in the same way as\n\t\t\t\tan opponent's refutations in argument, to see whether the poet refers to the same\n\t\t\t\tthing in the same relation and in the same sense, and has contradicted either what\n\t\t\t\the expressly says himself or what an intelligent person would take to be his\n\t\t\t\tmeaning.  It is right, however, to\n\t\t\t\tcensure both improbability and depravity where there is no necessity and no use is\n\t\t\t\tmade of the improbability.An example is\n\t\t\t\tEuripides' intro duction of Aegeus\n\t\t\t\torof depravitythe character of Menelans in the\n\t\t\t\t\t. The censures they bring are of five kinds; that things\n\t\t\t\tare either impossible or irrational or harmful or inconsistent or contrary to\n\t\t\t\tartistic correctness. The solutions must be studied under the heads specified above,\n\t\t\t\ttwelve in number. The question may be\n\t\t\t\traised whether the epic or the tragic form of representation is the better.\n\t\t\t\t\t If the better is the less vulgar\n\t\t\t\tand the less vulgar is always that which appeals to the better audience, then\n\t\t\t\tobviously the art which makes its appeal to everybody is eminently vulgar. And indeed actors think the audience do not understand unless\n\t\t\t\tthey put in something of their own, and so they strike all sorts of attitudes, as\n\t\t\t\tyou see bad flute-players whirling about if they have to do \"the\n\t\t\t\t\tDiscus,\" or mauling the leader of the chorus when\n\t\t\t\tthey are playing the \"Scylla.\" So tragedy is something like what the older\n\t\t\t\tschool of actors thought of their successors, for Mynniscus used to call Callippides\n\t\t\t\t\"the monkey,\" because he overacted, and the same was said of Pindarus.\n\t\t\t\t The whole tragic art, then, is\n\t\t\t\tto epic poetry what these later actors were compared to their predecessors, since\n\t\t\t\taccording to this view epic appeals to a cultivated audience which has no need of\n\t\t\t\tactor's poses, while tragedy appeals to a lower class. If then it is vulgar, it must\n\t\t\t\tobviously be inferior. First of all, this is not a criticism of poetry but of\n\t\t\t\tacting: even in reciting a minstrel can overdo his gestures, as Sosistratus did, or\n\t\t\t\tin a singing competition, like Mnasitheus of Opus. Besides it is\n\t\t\t\tnot all attitudinizing that ought to be barred any more than all dancing, but only\n\t\t\t\tthe attitudes of inferior people. That was the objection to Callippides; and modern\n\t\t\t\tactors are similarly criticized for representing women who are not ladies.\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, tragedy fulfils its\n\t\t\t\tfunction even without acting, just as much as epic, and its quality can be gauged by\n\t\t\t\treading aloud. So, if it is in other respects superior, this disadvantage is not\n\t\t\t\tnecessarily inherent. Secondly, tragedy has all the elements of the\n\t\t\t\tepicit can even use the hexameter and in addition a considerable element of its own in the\n\t\t\t\tspectacle and the music, which make the pleasure all the more vivid;  and this vividness can be felt whether it is\n\t\t\t\tread or acted.  Another point is\n\t\t\t\tthat it attains its end with greater economy of length. What is concentrated is\n\t\t\t\talways more effective than what is spread over a long period; suppose, for example,\n\t\t\t\t\tSophocles'were to be turned into as many lines as there\n\t\t\t\tare in the.  Again, the art of the epic\n\t\t\t\thas less unity, as is shown by the fact that any one epic makes several tragedies.\n\t\t\t\tThe result is that, if the epic poet takes a single plot, either it is set forth so\n\t\t\t\tbriefly as to seem curtailed, or if it conforms to the limit of length\n\t\t\t\tit seems thin and diluted.In saying that epic has\n\t\t\t\tless unity I mean an epic made up of several separate actions.  The  has many such parts and so\n\t\t\t\thas the , and each by itself has a certain magnitude. And yet\n\t\t\t\tthe composition of these poems is as perfect as can be and each of them\n\t\t\t\tisas far as an epic may bea representation of a single action.\n\t\t\t\t\t If then tragedy is superior in\n\t\t\t\tthese respects and also in fulfilling its artistic functionfor tragedies\n\t\t\t\tand epics should produce not any form of pleasure but the pleasure we have\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribedthen obviously, since it\n\t\t\t\tattains its object better than the epic, the better of the two is tragedy. This must\n\t\t\t\tsuffice for our treatment of tragedy and epic, their characteristics, their species,\n\t\t\t\ttheir constituent parts, and their number and attributes; for the causes of success\n\t\t\t\tand failure; and for critical problems and their solutions. . . ."}}}}}
