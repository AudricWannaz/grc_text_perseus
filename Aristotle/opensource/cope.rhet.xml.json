Porson, Elmsley, and their English followers were in the habit of laying down rigorous and inflexible rules of Greek grammar, which were supposed to admit of no exception; any apparent violation of them was to be summarily emended: one of the great services rendered by Hermann to the study of the Greek language is the relaxation of these over exact rules, and the substitution of a rational and logical explanation of these differences of expression, and the analysis of their distinctions, for these often unwarranted alterations of the text.  particula est coniunctiva, says Hermann;  adiunctiva;  disiunctiva.

Hel. 182, , is an exact parallel. In  proper, this third term will not apply in  to  of the others, and some other word or phrase must necessarily be  to complete the sense; as in the passage of Herodotus quoted above, and in the text of Aristotle.

(duranti) does not seem to me to be in any way connected with the conception of present time, though the perfect often is; as when we say this  up to the present time, we often imply our belief in its continuance; and I should rather explain the present infin. in these cases as expressing the mere fact of the existence of the thing named, or the abstract notion of it. The present tense, as it is called, I act, I do, to act, to do, is in reality independent of time: the time present is, I am acting, I am doing; and the present infin. to do is the naked conception of doing without any connotation of time (so the  infinit. with the definite article stands for a   is the mere notion of being). The aorist infin. again may derive its notion of futurity and likelihood, either, as Hermann thinks, from the indefiniteness expressed by the tense, or, in other cases, from the connotation of , implying , which is also one of its acquired senses. The broad distinction will be, , I think it  fall, at some future time, and nothing more:  or , I think it , or  fall, under certain conditions; , I think the notion of falling belongs to it, I think it  fall; that is, that it is , or , to fall, : and , implying also the liability or likelihood of the preceding, is distinguished from it (according to Hermann) by  representing the act or event as transient and not permanent.

Phil. 918), what dost thou intend to do, where the expression of the liability must needs be omitted, and still more the transient nature of the proposed act.

VII, c. 12, seq. and X, c. 2. Aristotle's conclusion (in Bk. X) is that though pleasure may be regarded as good it is not  good, i.e. the supreme good, good in itself, because there are  pleasures which are not proper objects of choice and therefore not good. Eudemus (if the seventh book be his), seems rather to be inclined to the contrary view; it is said at any rate, c. 14, init., , and three lines further, . And at the beginning of c. 13, in answer to Plato's objection in the Philebus, we find, . This difference of view between the master and pupil (on the supposition that eudemus is the author of Bk.

The best way of meeting the difficulty seems to be to adopt, with Spengel, the reading of the best MS A^{c}. This omits the words , without which the sense is clear and consistent. For it must be owing to its being  that they are inclined to (would) admit it, just as (it is equally evident that, by the same rule, in the opposite case) those who are praised by their enemies must be worthless, (because if your enemy approves of your conduct towards him, which is assumed to be hostile, it shews that you can have done him no harm: and therefore that you have been wanting either in courage or patriotism or energy and skill). Of this the example of the Corinthians is now a real instance, and their suspicion of Simonides' intentions may be traced to the general rule. And this was why the Corinthians conceived the suspicion that they had been insulted by Simonides, when he wrote, Ilium has no fault to find with the Corinthians (which it ought to have had if they had done their duty). The Corinthians misinterpreted Simonides expressions; his intentions were innocent, but he failed to perceive the inference that might be derived from them. The line of Simonides is apparently misquoted by a lapse of memory. The Schol. Pind. Ol. XIII p. 78, who cites it, has  () for ; and this reading appears also in another reference to it in Plut. Vit.

Here however an intermediate step is introduced between the feeling and its real origin. This is the love of honour. Censuring and finding fault implies an advantageous contrast between ourselves and those whom we thus tax, a superiority in judgment or virtue, which gives us the right to  find fault; and the honour we all love is reflected upon ourselves by the contrast.

By his conduct and services he had ingratiated himself with Dion's mercenaries, whom he incited to murder their general, and thereby made himself master of Syracuse. Before this, he had spread calumnious reports about Dion and excited the citizens against him. Dion being informed of this took no precautions for his own safety; partly in scorn of the attempt, and partly because he was unwilling to preserve his own power and life at the expense of the destruction of his friends: the scheme accordingly took effect, and Dion was shortly after put to death. Aristotle says upon this that Callippus justified the act by arguing that as Dion had now knowledge of his designs, and his own life  was in danger, this anticipation of the other, was a mere measure of precaution or retaliation, and no crime at all. This suspicion of Callippus is the ground of his  and the occasion of the , or sundering of their apparent friendship.

Whether  is another malicious perversion of Cleophon, on the hypothesis that red hair implies a licentious disposition, or depravity in generalas seems to have been the opinion of the Normans, who had the proverb, , (Wace, , quoted by Sir F. Palgrave,  II 721)or Aristotle, quoting from memory, has quoted, , cannot now be ascertained. At all events it is unlikely that  intended any such imputation on Critias' character, whatever may have been the case with Cleophon; for  Critias is evidently considered as a boy or very young man from the tone of the address or message, and Victorius shews from Theocr. Id. VIII. 3, , that red hair in a boy in the eyes of the Greeks was a beauty and not a deformity. It seems to me that Solon wrote , as Proclus gives it, and that the other reading is due either to Cleophon's malice if we interpret it , or to Aristotle's want of memory, if we take it as synonymous with . The evidence of Critias'  derived from the verses is plainly a false inference of Cleophon and not really contained in the original: the statement in Plat. Charm. 157 E, that Solon wrote Elegies in praise of the house of Critias, and spoke of its members as distinguished by personal beauty and virtue and all other so-called happiness, is altogether against any such supposition. Victorius, who regards the inference drawn by Cleophon as justified by the language of the verses, endeavours to reconcile this with the eulogistic character of the elegy, by the remark that Critias may have been an exception to the general good character of his family.

I will only add one remark upon this interesting subject; that when Aristotle assigns , the contempt and indifference to our feelings and sense of personal dignity implied in the notion of slight, as the main cause of the emotion of anger, he is thinking only of the angry passion as excited against a fellow man. Yet we are angry with a dog that bites, or a cat that scratches us, and here there cannot in all cases be any sense of undeserved contempt or indifference to provoke the angry feeling; though perhaps sometimes it may be increased by such an act of aggression, if the animal happen to be a pet or favourite, in which case we may extend (by analogy) human feelings to the brute, comparing him unconsciously with a  who has injured us, and forgetting the intellectual and moral differences of the two, which aggravate the offence in the  subject.

The feelings and dispositions in ourselves indicative of confidence, are, the opinion which we entertain of great success in our previous undertakings, and of having hitherto been exempt from injury, or if we have often run into danger and escaped: all of these are apt to make men sanguine as regards the future. Comp. Virg. Aen. I 198,  Hor. Od. I 7. 30,    For there are two things which make men insensible (to danger), either never to have experienced it (from ignorance, which inspires confidence) or to have plenty of helps, resources, means of defence, to resist and overcome it; as in dangers at sea, those who have never had experience of a storm are confident as to the future, and those who have derived from their experience plenty of resources. What is said here of the inexperience of men at sea tending to confidence seems to be contradicted by the observation in Eth. Nic. III 9, 1115  1, . Victorius thus reconciles the apparently conflicting statements: in the passage of the Ethics the brave men, who have had no experience,  keep up their courage though they despair of safety, and are indignant at such a death as that of drowning; the death which they covet being death on the field of battle: the sailors on the contrary are sanguine by reason of the resources which their experience has taught them. Still the contradiction is not removed by this explanation; for in the Rhetoric the inexperienced are confident, in the Ethics they are in despair, though their courage may not fail. In fact the two cases are not identical, nor intended to be so. In the Ethics the virtue of courage is displayed in the extremest danger, in the other there is no virtue at all; the ignorance of the. danger inspires confidencenot courageand that is all.

Compassion, according to him, is one of the benevolent affections, a group subordinate to the family of Tender Emotions. This appears to be a juster view of the nature and connexion of the feeling than the account given by Aristotle. The fact is, as I have elsewhere stated, that the conception of general benevolence and love and duty to our fellow-creatures, is of modern and Christian origin, and finds no place in Aristotle's Ethical System: the  of the preceding chapter includes but  a small part of it, being in fact confined to doing a service to a friend in need. Again the limitation of pity to those sufferings to which we ourselves or our friends are exposed, ascribes a selfishness to the emotion which seems not necessarily to belong to it. In fact if this were true, the God of the Christian, and the gods of the heathen would be alike incapable of it. Hobbes, in accordance with his theory of universal selfishness, goes beyond Aristotle in attributing the feeling solely to self-love. , Pt. I. c. 6, Grief for the calamity of another is Pity; and ariseth from the imagination that the like calamity may befall himself; and therefore is called also Compassion, and in the phrase of this present time a Fellow-feeling.

Only  is repeated, which shews that the difference between this and  ishere at all events one of expression merely and not of conception. This is confirmed by the details of things painful which are enumerated in  8, all of them evils affecting the body alone.

The words of  5,  are, whether they are intended for it or not, a correction of the blunder made in the Ethics. It is plain enough, as we are here told in the Rhetoric, that the two  in question are but two different phases of the same  or mental disposition: the same man who feels pain at his neighbour's good fortune  will feel pleasure at his misfortunes, and the two cannot be opposed as extremes.

This however cannot possibly be Aristotle's meaning: birth and beauty certainly have no claim  to any other advantages. When a bad man makes his way to wealth or power, we infer that they have been acquired by fraud or injustice, and thence that he is undeserving of them, which excites our indignation; but no such inference can be drawn from the possession of birth or beauty, there is no such thing as illicit, or undeserved possession of them. Aristotle seems to have meant, what Victorius attributes to him, that, besides moral excellence,  gifts and excellences are also exempt from righteous indignation, for the reason above giventhat they  gifts of nature, and the possessors are in no way responsible for them: and this is fully confirmed by the connexion of what immediately follows.

For it doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes; and pointeth at them, and cometh oftener into their remembrance, and incurreth likewise more into the note of others: and envy ever redoubleth from speech and fame.

Victorius takes what I believe to be the right view on the point. The meaning will then be, that the negative, the contradictory, of pain, i. e. pleasure (the two never co-existing), is excited by the opposite circumstances to those which are productive of the pain of envy; if pain under particular circumstances is excited by the sight of the good fortune of another, substitute the opposite, ill fortune for good fortune in each case, and you will have the appropriate topics for giving rise to the feeling of pleasure in your audience. This, says Victorius, is , wanton malice, malevolent pleasure in the misfortunes of others. The above interpretation is at all events free from the objection to which Schrader's is liable, namely that it makes Aristotle say that the same mental state or disposition is painful and pleasurable. The choice between the two depends mainly upon the interpretation of  and . I understand by the former the , the common character of all the classes distinguished in the analysis; Schrader of the members of the several classes, the ambitious, the prosperous and successful; and in his view these classes must fall under the several states of mind designated by , such as ambition; though how it can be applied to others, such as the prosperous and successful, his second instance, he does not inform us. If by the state of mind the  or emotion is meant (which seems to be Spengel's view), it is quite impossible that two such states, one pleasurable and the other painful, can be the same. Schrader, however, appears to take the  in a different sense, for the character or habit of mind, the mental constitution, which tends to produce such and such feelings; and in this point of view, though ambition (his first instance) may fairly enough be called a disposition of mind, yet I cannot see how the second, the prosperous and successful men, or prosperity and success, can well be included in the designation."}, {"foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "prota/seis"}, "pb": {"@n": "131"}, "#text": "In conclusion I will transcribe part of his note, that the reader may have the opportunity of deciding for himself; merely adding that manuscript and editorial authority is against his omission of the negative, and that though his interpretation is very plausible at first sight, I doubt whether it can be right, for the reasons stated.

His principal object in writing, he says, p. 122, is to defend against Brandis' criticisms Spengel's view that the original arrangement of Aristotle in treating the subjects of the second book has been subsequently inverted in the order in which they now stand; Aristotle having intended to complete the survey of the logical department of Rhetoric before he entered upon the  and .

How or why the order was changed, neither he nor Spengel gives us any indication; and the supposition of these repeated interpolations has little or no foundation except his own hypothesis of the inseparable connexion of the  and : for my own part I cannot find in the passages which he quotes in support of this opinion, or elsewhere in Aristotle's Rhetoric, any statement of a necessary connexion between the two, such as to make it imperative that the  should be treated immediately after the . The order of treatment which we find in the received text appears to be sufficiently natural and regular to defend it in default of the strongest evidence to the contraryagainst the suspicion of dislocation and interpolation, though no doubt the order suggested by Vahlen may be, considered in itself, more strictly logical and consecutive.

In interpreting a rhetorical topic which is to guide men's practice, it is plain that we must keep clear of metaphysics. The beginning and end here have nothing to do with the finite and infinite. Nor is it meant that things that can be begun necessarily admit of being finished: the Tower of Babel, as well as other recorded instances of , shew that this is not true.

All that is really meant is, that if you want to know whether the end of any course of action, plan, scheme, or indeed of anythingis possible, you must look to the begining: beginning implies end: if it can be begun, it can also be brought to an end: nothing that is known to be impossible, like squaring the circle, can ever have a beginning, or be brought into being.

The example of this is a man , , loudly asserting that Solon's universally accepted maxim, or the precept conveyed by it, is untrue, or at any rate liable to exception; for if so and so (some imaginary person) had had a true knowledge of himself (and his own incapacity) he never would have aspired to be a general: but he  done so, and succeeded in the attempt: and this  shews the falsity of the rule, as a prudential maxim, at any rate in this case; and also being  provokes the indignation of the speaker.

Iphicrates, instead of disobeying the precept, conformed to it in the strictest sense; he did  so well, he was so fully aware of his capacity for fulfilling the duties of the office, that he did not hesitate to apply for and exercise the command of an army. Victorius' words are;  dicet, qui ira percitus ita loquetur (but what is the  of the anger, when it is thus interpreted? The mere contradiction of an universal maxim does not give rise to a fit of passion), falsum est omnino, quod aiunt, debere homines seipsos nosse: hic enim profecto si se ipsum cognosset nunquam praetor ducere exercitum voluisset.

Formal proofs, such as they appear in Dialectics and Rhetoric, are of an universal nature, and therefore applicable alike to all branches of science; they form the collective Topics, which Aristotle has elaborated for Dialectics with wonderful completeness in the most comprehensive of all the works of his Organon; whilst in Rhetoric, not without reference to the other, he has selected and put forward only what is most essential. Material proofs are with him such as are derived from the principles of the special sciences, the knowledge of which the orator must bring with him, ready for any occasion on which it may be properly applied. Aristotle is by no means of opinion that a mere superficial description, without thorough knowledge of the object to be described, and alien to the true spirit of it, can be called rhetorical with propriety; on the contrary, the orator must be thoroughly imbued with the knowledge of his subject, whatever department of knowledge it may happen to belong to, and from this special science bring with him his concrete proofs, for the purpose of convincing. Accordingly, for forensic pleading the accurate study of law is indispensable, for the deliberative speaking or counselling that of Politics, the science of government, and similarly for each kind the special knowledge which belongs to it. But this special knowledge cannot be obtained from Rhetoric itself, otherwise it would carry in itself all knowledge, which is not the case: the office of Rhetoric is, to work up the proofs which the special science offers, to combine them with the formal, and so to bring the subject within the reach of universal comprehension.", {"hi": [{"@rend": "italic", "#text": "Philologus"}, {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "Aristotle"}], "#text": "On the contents of this chapter, and its connexion with the Topics, Brandis, ap.

There had been one of the usual quarrels between the aristocratical () and the popular party at Sicyon, of which Euphron took advantage, with the design of making himself master of the city. But knowing that as long as the Thebans occupied the acropolis he had no chance of success, he collected a large sum of money and went to Thebes with the intention of bribing the Thebans to assist him. Some Sicyonian exiles learning this, followed him to Thebes and murdered him in the acropolis. Here the murderers were brought to trial before the magistrates and council, who were already there assembled. The accusation of the magistrates, and the speech for the defence, are both recorded. All the accused with one exception asserted their innocence: one alone admitted the fact, and in justification of it pleaded for himself and the rest the guilt of the man that had been slain, just as Aristotle here describes it. .

The general principle that is to be inferred from the induction may be the Platonic paradox that the true statesmen are philosophers: this appears from the three examples, that the Athenians flourished and were happy under the laws of Solon, and the Lacedaemonians under those of Lycurgus; and at Thebes, the prosperity (or flourishing condition) of the city was coeval with the accession of its leaders to philosophy. I have rendered the last words thus to express . But the meaning of the whole is doubtless as Victorius gives it, that the happiness of Thebes, that is, its virtue and glory, began and ended with the philosophy of its leaders. This is inadequately expressed by , which only conveys the beginning of the coincidence: and, if the explanation of the suppressed rule be right, would have been better represented by .

I will not however deny that Plato may even in conversation have been occasionally guilty of dogmatizing: in his latest writings, such as the Timaeus and Laws, and to a less degree in the Republic, such a tendency undoubtedly shews itself: but by far the larger portion of his dialogues, which represent probably nearly three-fourths of his entire life, are pervaded by a directly opposite spirit, and are the very impersonation of intellectual freedom. Following the method and practice of his master, he submits every question as it arises to the freest dialectical discussion, so that it is often impossible to decide which way (at the period of writing any particular dialogue) his own opinion inclines; and always presents in the strongest light any objections and difficulties in the thesis which he is maintaining. I think at all events with Victorius that Aristotle at any rate lends no countenance here to Aristippus' charge of dogmatic assumption. So far as his outward bearing and demeanour were concerned, I can conceive that he may have been haughty and reserved, possibly even morose: but a habit of laying down the law, or of undue assumption and pretension in lecturing and discussionwhich is what Aristippus appears here to attribute to himseems to me to be inconsistent with what we known from his dialogues to have been the ordinary habit of his mind, at least until he was already advanced in life."}, {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "e)paggeltikw/teron] e)pagge/llesqai"}, "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)p'  a)reth/n"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*prwtago/rou e)pa/ggelma"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "fainome/nh sofi/a"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "tou=to/ e)stin, w)= *s., to\\ e)pa/ggelma o(\\ e)pagge/llomai"}], "hi": [{"@rend": "italic", "#text": "a"}, {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "assumption"}], "#text": "is to announce, make public profession of, as of an art, pursuit, business, practice.

But the fact or character commemorated might be either good or evil; and in the former case it was the name of a public benefactor, in the latter of some signal malefactor or public enemy, that was inscribed. It is usual to apply the latter explanation to the case here in question, which is probably what is meant; and then it seems the story must be this:At some uncertain time previous to the expulsion of the thirty tyrants and their Lacedaemonian supporters by Thrasybulus and his friends, the recovery of the city, and restoration of the demus in 403 B.C., the name of Leodamas had been inscribed as a mark of infamyas a traitor to his country, as Sauppe u. s. and Herm.   144. 11 interpret itaccording to custom on a pillar erected in the Acropolis for that purpose. Now if it was hatred to the demus that was engraved on it () as  the sign and cause of his imputed infamy, it follows that it must have been erected at some period when the popular party was in the ascendant; Leodamas of course being a supporter of the oligarchs. When his friends were in power and he had the opportunity, Thrasybulus charges him,  of course, with having struck or cut it out to efface the record. He denies the possibility of their  by arguing the absence of all assignable , which could have produced it: for this permanent record of his hostility to the people would have been an additional recommendation to the Thirty, who would have trusted him all the more for it. Thrasybulus, says Victorius, was accusing Leodamas of being an enemy and a traitor to his country; and one of the arguments he brought forward was the existence of this inscription, the subsequent disappearance of which he attempted to explain.

Schrader, though he refers to the passage, takes no account of the words , which it seems must have formed part of it. Victorius has endeavoured to combine both in his explanation of the fallacyI am not at all sure that I understand it: I will therefore transcribe it in his own words  Tu scis te esse in Piraeo: quod concedebatur ipsi (the respondent), ac verum erat. Scis triremes Atheniensium esse in Sicilia (miserant enim eo classem ut eam insulam occuparent); id quoque non inficiabatur qui interrogatus erat. Tu scis igitur (aiebat ille) in Piraeo triremes esse, in Sicilia existens. Qua captione ipsum in Sicilia, scire triremes esse in Piraeo cogebatur; cum eo namque, scire in Piraeo, coniungebatur triremes esse: a quo remotum primo pronunciatum fuerat: ab illo vero, in Sicilia, cum quo copulatum editum primo fuerat, disiungebatur: atque ita efficiebatur ipsum, in Sicilia cum esset, scire in Piraeo triremes esse. Quod vero hic adiungit : separatim scilicet utrunque nosse intelligit, se in portu Atheniensium tunc esse: triremesque item in Sicilia. E quorum conglutinatione fallax ratio conflata, quae inde vocata est . By this must be meant, that the two statements, existence or knowledge in the Piraeus, and knowledge of triremes in Sicily, which ought to be kept separate, are combined in one statement, and hence the fallacy: true separately, they are not true together. Whether this is a satisfactory version of Euthydemus' fallacy I fear I must leave it to others to decide. My principal difficulty is as to the mode of transition from the Piraeus to Sicily in the two first propositions, which as far as I can see is not satisfactorily accounted for. What is there to connect the knowing that you are in the Piraeus, or knowing in the Piraeus, with knowing or being in Sicily? And yet there must be some connexion, apparent at least if not real, to make the fallacy plausible. This is nevertheless Alexander's solution of it. Comm. ad Top. 177  12, . However this may be, at any rate, if Plato's dialogue is to be trusted, there is no kind of fallacy however silly, transparent, and contemptible, of which Euthydemus and his partner were incapable; and the weight of authority, notwithstanding the utter want of sense, must decide us to accept this explanation."}, {"pb": {"@n": "309"}, "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)ristikh/"}, "#text": "Of Euthydemus, and his brother and fellow-sophist Dionysodorus, contemporaries of Socrates, nearly all that we know is derived from Plato's Euthydemus.

A flood of field-mice poured over the enemy by night, which devoured their quivers and bows, and besides, the handles of their shields, so that on the following day, flying without arms, many of them fell, &c.

The connexion of the passage thus altered is this: There are two ways of meeting and refuting an opponent's example, the rhetorical substitute for a complete induction: first, if we have an adverse or contradictory instance () to bring against his general rulea case exceptional to the example or examples that he has collected in support of itthis is refuted, at all events so far as to shew that it is not , even though the majority of cases (, more of them and oftener) of the same kind, or examples, are otherwise (, are in another direction, or go to prove the contrary): or, secondly, if the great majority of instances are in conformity with his rule (), and (which must be supplied) we have no instance to the contrary to adduce, we must then contend that the present instance (any one of his examples) is not analogous, not a case in point, that there is some difference either of kind and quality, or of mode, or some other, whatever it may be, between the example and that with which he compares it, which prevents its applicability here.

Still, , introduced by Gorgias and his followers into their arts, may be included with the others, E. M. C). One of the hypotheses suggested by Brandis on the relation of this third book to the two others seems to me highly probable. It is that the third book which is in fact complete in itself (E. M. C.)was written earlier than the rest, and before the author had arrived at his final conception of Rhetoric in its connexion with Logic; and was afterwards appended to the two others, instead of a new treatise written specially with a view to them; and this would account for the repetitions, such as that of III 17, which certainly are difficult to explain, if the third book be supposed to have been written after, and in connexion with, the first and second. With regard to the references, as in cc. 1 and 10, to one of the preceding books, Brandis thinks they might easily have been introduced  of the third to the two others. He altogether rejects the notion that any one but Aristotle could have been the author of it. (It has in fact all the characteristics of Aristotle's style, mode of thought and expression, and nothing whatever which is out of character with him: on the other hand let any two sentences in this book and the Rhet. ad Alex. be compared, and it is seen at once that the style, manner, and mode of treatment are all totally different. E. M. C.) Lastly he notes that it is characteristic of Aristotle's writings (this, I think, deserves attention)  to give a full account of the contents of the work at the beginning of it; and such omission of style and arrangement was all the more likely in the Rhetoric in so far as it was part of Aristotle's theory of the art that everything but proof direct or indirect was non-essential and completely subordinate.

Whilst Gorgias was in Thessaly, where he seems to have spent a considerable time at Larissa, some Thessalian, who had no doubt heard his boast that he was able and ready to answer any question upon any subject, took him at his word, and asked him what constituted a citizen.This is the constitutional question which gives occasion to Aristotle's quotation.Partly in jest, and partly because he was really at a loss, he replied, that citizens were made by citizen-manufacturers: as the vessels made by mortarmanufacturers were mortars, so those made by the Larissaean-manufacturers were Larissaean citizens or Larissaeans: for there were such people as , besides the Thessalian city, denotes also some kind of kettle or other cooking-utensil. The reply is much the same as if some one being asked, What makes a citizen of the town of Sandwich? were to answer, a cook, for he is a sandwich-maker; and is no bad specimen of the way in which Gorgias most likely fulfilled his promise of solving any problem whatsoever that was proposed to him. It may be doubted whether, as Schneider supposes, there is also an ambiguity in : the word bears also the sense of a magistrate, as the grammarians tell us, especially in Doric states. Larissa was not a Doric state: but we learn from K. O. Mller,  Bk. III ch. 8. 5; from Thuc.

This celebrated verse, Hippol. 608, probably owes a good deal of its notoriety to Aristophanes' parody of it near the end of the Frogs. Seldom has so much ado about nothing been made as about this unlucky line. The charge of recommending perjury is at any rate a gross exaggeration. Nor does it  imply even mental reservation.
