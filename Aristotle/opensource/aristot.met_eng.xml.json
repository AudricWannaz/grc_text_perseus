Not only with a view to action, but even when no action is\n\t\t\t\t\tcontemplated, we prefer sight, generally speaking, to all the other\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses.The reason of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is that of all the senses sight best helps us to know things, and\n\t\t\t\t\treveals many distinctions.Now animals\n\t\t\t\t\tare by nature born with the power of sensation, and from this some\n\t\t\t\t\tacquire the faculty of memory, whereas others do not. Accordingly the former are more intelligent and\n\t\t\t\t\tcapable of learning than those which cannot remember.Such as cannot hear sounds (as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe bee, and any other similar type of creature) are intelligent, but\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot learn; those only are capable of learning which possess this\n\t\t\t\t\tsense in addition to the faculty of memory.Thus the other animals live by impressions and\n\t\t\t\t\tmemories, and have but a small share of experience; but the human race\n\t\t\t\t\tlives also by art and reasoning.It is from memory that men acquire experience,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the numerous memories of the same thing eventually produce the\n\t\t\t\t\teffect of a single experience. Experience seems\n\t\t\t\t\tvery similar to science and art,but actually it is through experience that men\n\t\t\t\t\tacquire science and art; for as Polus rightly says, \"experience\n\t\t\t\t\tproduces art, but inexperience chance.\" Art is produced\n\t\t\t\t\twhen from many notions of experience a single universal judgement is\n\t\t\t\t\tformed with regard to like objects.To have a judgement that when Callias was\n\t\t\t\t\tsuffering from this or that disease this or that benefited him, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly with Socrates and\n\t\t\t\t\tvarious other individuals, is a matter of experience; but to judge\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it benefits all persons of a certain type, considered as a class,\n\t\t\t\t\twho suffer from this or that disease (e.g. the phlegmatic or bilious\n\t\t\t\t\twhen suffering from burning fever) is a matter of art.It would seem that for practical purposes experience is in no way\n\t\t\t\t\tinferior to art; indeed we see men of experience succeeding more than\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who have theory without experience.The reason of this is a that experience is\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge of particulars, but art of universals; and actions and the\n\t\t\t\t\teffects produced are all concerned with the particular. For it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tman that the physician cures, except incidentally, but Callias or\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates or some other\n\t\t\t\t\tperson similarly named, who is incidentally a man as well.So if a man has theory without experience, and\n\t\t\t\t\tknows the universal, but does not know the particular contained in it,\n\t\t\t\t\the will often fail in his treatment; for it is the particular that\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be treated.Nevertheless we consider that knowledge and proficiency belong to\n\t\t\t\t\tart rather than to experience, and we assume that artists are wiser\n\t\t\t\t\tthan men of mere experience (which implies that in all cases wisdom\n\t\t\t\t\tdepends rather upon knowledge);and this is because the former know the cause,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas the latter do not. For the experienced know the fact, but not\n\t\t\t\t\tthe wherefore; but the artists know the wherefore and the cause. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same reason we consider that the master craftsmen in every\n\t\t\t\t\tprofession are more estimable and know more and are wiser than the\n\t\t\t\t\tartisans, because they know the reasons of the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which are done; but we think that the artisans, like certain\n\t\t\t\t\tinanimate objects, do things, but without knowing what they are doing\n\t\t\t\t\t(as, for instance, fire burns);only whereas inanimate objects perform all\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir actions in virtue of a certain natural quality, artisans perform\n\t\t\t\t\ttheirs through habit. Thus the master craftsmen are superior in\n\t\t\t\t\twisdom, not because they can do things, but because they possess a\n\t\t\t\t\ttheory and know the causes.In general\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sign of knowledge or ignorance is the ability to teach, and for\n\t\t\t\t\tthis reason we hold that art rather than experience is scientific\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge; for the artists can teach, but the others cannot.Further, we do not consider\n\t\t\t\t\tany of the senses to be Wisdom. They are indeed our chief sources of\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge about particulars, but they do not tell us the reason for\n\t\t\t\t\tanything, as for example why fire is hot, but only that it\n\t\t\t\t\t hot.It is therefore probable that at first\n\t\t\t\t\tthe inventor of any art which went further than the ordinary\n\t\t\t\t\tsensations was admired by his fellow-men, not merely because some of\n\t\t\t\t\this inventions were useful, but as being a wise and superior\n\t\t\t\t\tperson.And as more\n\t\t\t\t\tand more arts were discovered, some relating to the necessities and\n\t\t\t\t\tsome to the pastimes of life, the inventors of the latter were always\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidered wiser than those of the former,because their branches of knowledge did\n\t\t\t\t\tnot aim at utility.Hence\n\t\t\t\t\twhen all the discoveries of this kind were fully developed, the\n\t\t\t\t\tsciences which relate neither to pleasure nor yet to the necessities\n\t\t\t\t\tof life were invented, and first in those places where men had\n\t\t\t\t\tleisure. Thus the mathematical sciences originated in the neighborhood\n\t\t\t\t\tof , because there the\n\t\t\t\t\tpriestly class was allowed leisure.The\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference between art and science and the other kindred mental\n\t\t\t\t\tactivities has been stated in the; the reason for our\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent discussion is that it is generally assumed that what is called\n\t\t\t\t\tWisdom is concerned with the primary causes and\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples, so that, as has been already stated, the man of experience\n\t\t\t\t\tis held to be wiser than the mere possessors of any power of\n\t\t\t\t\tsensation, the artist than the man of experience, the master craftsman\n\t\t\t\t\tthan the artisan; and the speculative sciences to be more learned than\n\t\t\t\t\tthe productive. Thus it is clear that Wisdom is\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge of certain principles and causes.Since\n\t\t\t\t\twe are investigating this kind of knowledge, we must consider what\n\t\t\t\t\tthese causes and principles are whose knowledge is Wisdom. Perhaps it\n\t\t\t\t\twill be clearer if we take the opinions which we hold about the wise\n\t\t\t\t\tman. We consider\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst, then, that the wise man knows all things, so far as it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible, without having knowledge of every one of them individually;\n\t\t\t\t\tnext, that the wise man is he who can comprehend difficult things,\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch as are not easy for human comprehension (for sense-perception,\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing common to all, is easy, and has nothing to do with Wisdom); and\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther that in every branch of knowledge a man is wiser in proportion\n\t\t\t\t\tas he is more accurately informed and better able to expound the\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses. Again among\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sciences we consider that that science which is desirable in\n\t\t\t\t\titself and for the sake of knowledge is more nearly Wisdom than that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is desirable for its results, and that the superior is more\n\t\t\t\t\tnearly Wisdom than the subsidiary; for the wise man should give\n\t\t\t\t\torders, not receive them; nor should he obey others, but the less wise\n\t\t\t\t\tshould obey him.Such in kindand in number are the opinions which we\n\t\t\t\t\thold with regard to Wisdom and the wise. Of the qualities there\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribed the knowledge of everything must necessarily belong to him\n\t\t\t\t\twho in the highest degree possesses knowledge of the universal,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause he knows in a sense all the particulars which it comprises.\n\t\t\t\t\tThese things, viz. the most universal, are perhaps the hardest for man\n\t\t\t\t\tto grasp, because they are furthest removed from the senses.Again, the most exact of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsciences are those which are most concerned with the first principles;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor those which are based on fewer principles are more exact than\n\t\t\t\t\tthose which include additional principles; e.g., arithmetic is more\n\t\t\t\t\texact than geometry.Moreover, the science which investigates causes is more instructive\n\t\t\t\t\tthan one which does not, for it is those who tell us the causes of any\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular thing who instruct us. Moreover, knowledge and\n\t\t\t\t\tunderstanding which are desirable for their own sake are most\n\t\t\t\t\tattainable in the knowledge of that which is most knowable. For the\n\t\t\t\t\tman who desires knowledge for its own sake will most desire the most\n\t\t\t\t\tperfect knowledge, and this is the knowledge of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmost knowable, and the things which are most knowable are first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples and causes; for it is through these and from these that\n\t\t\t\t\tother things come to be known, and not these through the particulars\n\t\t\t\t\twhich fall under them.And\n\t\t\t\t\tthat science is supreme, and superior to the subsidiary, which knows\n\t\t\t\t\tfor what end each action is to be done; i.e. the Good in each\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular case, and in general the highest Good in the whole of\n\t\t\t\t\tnature.Thus as a result of all the above\n\t\t\t\t\tconsiderations the term which we are investigating falls under the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame science, which must speculate about first principles and causes;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the Good, i.e. the  , is one of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses.That it is not a\n\t\t\t\t\tproductive science is clear from a consideration of the first\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophers.It is\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough wonder that men now begin and originally began to\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophize; wondering in the first place at obvious perplexities,\n\t\t\t\t\tand then by gradual progression raising questions about the greater\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters too, e.g. about the changes of the moon and of the sun, about\n\t\t\t\t\tthe stars and about the origin of the universe.Now he who wonders and is perplexed\n\t\t\t\t\tfeels that he is ignorant (thus the myth-lover is in a sense a\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosopher, since myths are composed of wonders);therefore if it was to escape ignorance\n\t\t\t\t\tthat men studied philosophy, it is obvious that they pursued science\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the sake of knowledge, and not for any practical\n\t\t\t\t\tutility.The actual\n\t\t\t\t\tcourse of events bears witness to this; for speculation of this kind\n\t\t\t\t\tbegan with a view to recreation and pastime, at a time when\n\t\t\t\t\tpractically all the necessities of life were already supplied. Clearly\n\t\t\t\t\tthen it is for no extrinsic advantage that we seek this knowledge; for\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as we call a man independent who exists for himself and not for\n\t\t\t\t\tanother, so we call this the only independent science, since it alone\n\t\t\t\t\texists for itself.For this reason its acquisition might\n\t\t\t\t\tjustly be supposed to be beyond human power, since in many respects\n\t\t\t\t\thuman nature is servile; in which case, as Simonides says, \"God alone can have this\n\t\t\t\t\tprivilege,\" and man should only seek the knowledge which is within his\n\t\t\t\t\treach.Indeed if the\n\t\t\t\t\tpoets are right and the Deity is by nature jealous, it is probable that in this case He would be\n\t\t\t\t\tparticularly jealous, and all those who excel in knowledge\n\t\t\t\t\tunfortunate. But it is impossible for the Deity to be jealous (indeed,\n\t\t\t\t\tas the proverb says, \"poets\n\t\t\t\t\ttell many a lie\"), nor must we suppose that any other form of\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge is more precious than this; for what is most divine is most\n\t\t\t\t\tprecious.Now there\n\t\t\t\t\tare two ways only in which it can be divine. A science is divine if it\n\t\t\t\t\tis peculiarly the possession of God, or if it is concerned with divine\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters. And this science alone fulfils both these conditions; for (a)\n\t\t\t\t\tall believe that God is one of the causes and a kind of principle, and\n\t\t\t\t\t(b) God is the sole or chief possessor of this sort of knowledge.\n\t\t\t\t\tAccordingly, although all other sciences are more necessary than this,\n\t\t\t\t\tnone is more excellent.The acquisition of this\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge, however, must in a sense result in something which is the\n\t\t\t\t\treverse of the outlook with which we first approached the inquiry. All\n\t\t\t\t\tbegin, as we have said, by wondering that things should be as they\n\t\t\t\t\tare, e.g. with regard to marionettes, or the solstices, or the\n\t\t\t\t\tincommensurability of the diagonal of a\n\t\t\t\t\tsquare; because it seems wonderful to everyone who has not yet\n\t\t\t\t\tperceived the cause that a thing should not be measurable by the\n\t\t\t\t\tsmallest unit.But we must\n\t\t\t\t\tend with the contrary and (according to the proverb) the better view,\n\t\t\t\t\tas men do even in these cases when they understand them;for a geometrician would wonder\n\t\t\t\t\tat nothing so much as if the diagonal were to become\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasurable.Thus we have stated\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is the nature of the science which we are seeking, and what is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe object which our search and our whole investigation must\n\t\t\t\t\tattain.It is clear that we must obtain knowledge of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe primary causes, because it is when we think that we understand its\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary cause that we claim to know each particular thing. Now there\n\t\t\t\t\tare four recognized kinds of cause. Of these we hold that one is the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence or essential nature of the thing (since the \"reason why\" of a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is ultimately reducible to its formula, and the ultimate \"reason\n\t\t\t\t\twhy\" is a cause and principle); another is the matter or substrate;\n\t\t\t\t\tthe third is the source of motion; and the fourth is the cause which\n\t\t\t\t\tis opposite to this, namely the purpose or \"good\";for this is the end of every generative\n\t\t\t\t\tor motive process. We have investigated these sufficiently in the\n\t\t\t\t\t; however, let us avail ourselves of the evidence of\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who have before us approached the investigation of reality and\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophized about Truth. For clearly they too recognize certain\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples and causes, and so it will be of some assistance to our\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent inquiry if we study their teaching; because we shall either\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscover some other kind of cause, or have more confidence in those\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we have just described.Most of the earliest\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophers conceived only of material principles as underlying all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings. That of which all things consist, from which they first come\n\t\t\t\t\tand into which on their destruction they are ultimately resolved, of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the essence persists although modified by its\n\t\t\t\t\taffectionsthis, they say, is an element and principle of\n\t\t\t\t\texisting things. Hence they believe that nothing is either generated\n\t\t\t\t\tor destroyed, since this kind of primary entity always persists.\n\t\t\t\t\tSimilarly we do not say that\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates comes into being  when he\n\t\t\t\t\tbecomes handsome or cultured, nor that he is destroyed when he loses\n\t\t\t\t\tthese qualities; because the substrate,\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates himself, persists.In the same way nothing else is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated or destroyed; for there is some one entity (or more than\n\t\t\t\t\tone) which always persists and from which all other things are\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated. All are not\n\t\t\t\t\tagreed, however,as to the\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber and character of these principles.\n\t\t\t\t\tThales, the founder of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis school of philosophy, says the permanent entity is water (which is\n\t\t\t\t\twhy he also propounded that the earth floats on water). Presumably he\n\t\t\t\t\tderived this assumption from seeing that the nutriment of everything\n\t\t\t\t\tis moist, and that heat itself is generated from moisture and depends\n\t\t\t\t\tupon it for its existence (and that from which a thing is generated is\n\t\t\t\t\talways its first principle). He derived his assumption, then, from\n\t\t\t\t\tthis; and also from the fact that the seeds of everything have a moist\n\t\t\t\t\tnature, whereas water is the first principle of the nature of moist\n\t\t\t\t\tthings.There are some who think that the men of very\n\t\t\t\t\tancient times, long before the present era, who first speculated about\n\t\t\t\t\tthe gods, also held this same opinion about the primary entity. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthey represented\n\t\t\t\t\tOceanus and Tethys to be the parents of creation, and the oath of the\n\t\t\t\t\tgods to be by water\n\t\t\t\t\tStyx, as they call it. Now what is most\n\t\t\t\t\tancient is most revered, and what is most revered is what we swear by.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhether\n\t\t\t\t\tthis view of the primary entity is really ancient and time-honored may\n\t\t\t\t\tperhaps be considered uncertain; however, it is said that this was\n\t\t\t\t\tThales' opinion\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerning the first cause. (I say nothing of Hippo, because no one would presume to include him in this\n\t\t\t\t\tcompany, in view of the paltriness of his intelligence.)Anaximenes and Diogenes\n\t\t\t\t\theld that air is prior to water, and is of all corporeal elements most\n\t\t\t\t\ttruly the first principle. Hippasus of  and Heraclitus of  hold\n\t\t\t\t\tthis of fire; and Empedoclesadding\n\t\t\t\t\tearth as a fourth to those already mentionedtakes all four.\n\t\t\t\t\tThese, he says, always persist, and are only generated in respect of\n\t\t\t\t\tmultitude and paucity, according as they are combined into unity or\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiated out of unity.Anaxagoras of Clazomenaeprior to Empedocles in point of\n\t\t\t\t\tage, but posterior in his activitiessays that the first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples are infinite in number. For he says that as a general rule\n\t\t\t\t\tall things which are, like fire and water, homoeomerous, are\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated and destroyed in this sense only, by combination and\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiation; otherwise they are neither generated nor destroyed,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut persist eternally.From this account\n\t\t\t\t\tit might be supposed that the only cause is of the kind called\n\t\t\t\t\t\"material.\" But as men proceeded in this way, the very circumstances\n\t\t\t\t\tof the case led them on and compelled them to seek further; because if\n\t\t\t\t\tit is really truethat all\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration and destruction is out of some one entity or even more than\n\t\t\t\t\tone,  does this happen, and what is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause?It is surely\n\t\t\t\t\tnot the substrate itself which causes itself to change. I mean, e.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat neither wood nor bronze is responsible for changing itself; wood\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not make a bed, nor bronze a statue, but something else is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of the change. Now to investigate this is to investigate the\n\t\t\t\t\tsecond type of cause: the source of motion, as we should\n\t\t\t\t\tsay.Those who were the very first to take up this\n\t\t\t\t\tinquiry, and who maintained that the substrate is one thing, had no\n\t\t\t\t\tmisgivings on the subject; but some of those who regard it as\n\t\t\t\t\tone thing, being baffled, as it were, by the inquiry, say that that\n\t\t\t\t\tone thing (and indeed the whole physical world) is immovable in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect not only of generation and destruction (this was a primitive\n\t\t\t\t\tbelief and was generally admitted) but of all other change. This\n\t\t\t\t\tbelief is peculiar to them. None\n\t\t\t\t\tof those who maintained that the universe is a unity achieved any\n\t\t\t\t\tconception of this type of cause, except perhaps Parmenides; and him only in so far as he admits, in a sense,\n\t\t\t\t\tnot one cause only but two.But\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who recognize more than one entity, e.g. hot and cold, or fire\n\t\t\t\t\tand earth, are better able to give a systematic explanation, because\n\t\t\t\t\tthey avail themselves of fire as being of a kinetic nature, and of\n\t\t\t\t\twater, earth, etc., as being the opposite.After these\n\t\t\t\t\tthinkers and the discovery of these causes, since they were\n\t\t\t\t\tinsufficient to account for the generation of the actual world, men\n\t\t\t\t\twere again compelled (as we have said) by truth itself to investigate\n\t\t\t\t\tthe next first principle.For presumably it is unnatural that either fire or earth or any\n\t\t\t\t\tother such element should cause existing things to be or become well\n\t\t\t\t\tand beautifully disposed; or indeed that those thinkers should hold\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch a view. Nor again was it satisfactory to commit so important a\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter to spontaneity and chance.Hence when someone said that there is Mind in\n\t\t\t\t\tnature, just as in animals, and that this is the cause of all order\n\t\t\t\t\tand arrangement, he seemed like a sane man in contrast with the\n\t\t\t\t\thaphazard statements of his predecessors.We know definitely that Anaxagoras adopted\n\t\t\t\t\tthis view; but Hermotimusof\n\t\t\t\t\tClazomenae is credited with having stated it earlier. Those thinkers,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, who held this view assumed a principle in things which is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of beauty, and the sort of cause by which motion is communicated\n\t\t\t\t\tto things.It might be inferred that the first person to\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider this question was Hesiod, or indeed anyone else who assumed\n\t\t\t\t\tLove or Desire as a first principle in things; e.g. Parmenides. For he\n\t\t\t\t\tsays, where he is describing the creation of the universe, And\n\t\t\t\t\tHesiod says,\n\t\t\t\t\t thus implying that there must be in the world some cause to\n\t\t\t\t\tmove things and combine them.The question of arranging these\n\t\t\t\t\tthinkers in order of priority may be decided later. Now since it was\n\t\t\t\t\tapparent that nature also contains the opposite of what is good, i.e.\n\t\t\t\t\tnot only order and beauty, but disorder and ugliness; and that there are more bad and common things than\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are good and beautiful: in view of this another thinker\n\t\t\t\t\tintroduced Love and Strife as the respective causes\n\t\t\t\t\tof these thingsbecause if one follows up and appreciates the statements of\n\t\t\t\t\tEmpedocles with a view to his real meaning and not to his obscure\n\t\t\t\t\tlanguage, it will be found that Love is the cause of good, and Strife\n\t\t\t\t\tof evil. Thus it would perhaps be correct to say that Empedocles in a\n\t\t\t\t\tsense spoke of evil and good as first principles, and was the first to\n\t\t\t\t\tdo sothat is, if the cause of all good things is absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tgood.These thinkers then, as I say, down to the\n\t\t\t\t\ttime of Empedocles, seem to have grasped two of the causes which we\n\t\t\t\t\thave defined in the : the material cause and the source of motion;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut only vaguely and indefinitely. They are like untrained soldiers in\n\t\t\t\t\ta battle, who rush about and often strike good blows, but without\n\t\t\t\t\tscience; in the same way these thinkers do not seem to understand\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir own statements, since it is clear that upon the whole they\n\t\t\t\t\tseldom or never apply them.Anaxagoras avails himself of Mind as an artificial device for\n\t\t\t\t\tproducing order, and drags it in whenever he is at a loss to\n\t\t\t\t\texplainsome necessary\n\t\t\t\t\tresult; but otherwise he makes anything rather than Mind the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\twhat happens. Again, Empedocles does indeed use causes to a\n\t\t\t\t\tgreater degree than Anaxagoras, but not sufficiently; nor does he\n\t\t\t\t\tattain to consistency in their use.At any rate Love often differentiates and\n\t\t\t\t\tStrife combines: because whenever the universe is differentiated into\n\t\t\t\t\tits elements by Strife, fire and each of the other elements are\n\t\t\t\t\tagglomerated into a unity; and whenever they are all combined together\n\t\t\t\t\tagain by Love, the particles of each element are necessarily again\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiated.Empedocles, then, differed from his\n\t\t\t\t\tpredecessors in that he first introduced the division of this cause,\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking the source of motion not one but two contrary forces.Further, he was the first to\n\t\t\t\t\tmaintain that the so-called material elements are fournot\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he uses them as four, but as two only, treating fire on the one hand by itself, and the elements opposed to\n\t\t\t\t\titearth, air and wateron the other, as a single\n\t\t\t\t\tnature.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis can be seen from a study of his writings.Such, then, as I say, is his account of the\n\t\t\t\t\tnature and number of the first principles.Leucippus, however,\n\t\t\t\t\tand his disciple Democritus\n\t\t\t\t\thold that the elements are the Full and the Voidcalling the\n\t\t\t\t\tone \"what is\" and the other \"what is not.\" Of these they identify the\n\t\t\t\t\tfull or solid with \"what is,\" and the void or rare with \"what is not\"\n\t\t\t\t\t(hence they hold that what is not is no less real than what is, because Void is as real as Body); and\n\t\t\t\t\tthey say that these are the material causes of things.And just as those who make the\n\t\t\t\t\tunderlying substance a unity generate all other things by means of its\n\t\t\t\t\tmodifications, assuming rarity and density as first principles of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese modifications, so these thinkers hold that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\"differences\" are the causes of everything else.These differences, they say,\n\t\t\t\t\tare three: shape, arrangement, and position; because they hold that\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is differs only in contour, inter-contact, and\n\t\t\t\t\t .(Of these contour means\n\t\t\t\t\tshape, inter-contact arrangement, and inclination position.) Thus,\n\t\t\t\t\te.g., A differs from N in shape, AN from NA in arrangement, and Z from\n\t\t\t\t\tN in position.As for motion, whence and how it arises in\n\t\t\t\t\tthings,they casually\n\t\t\t\t\tignored this point, very much as the other thinkers did. Such, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tas I say, seems to be the extent of the inquiries which the earlier\n\t\t\t\t\tthinkers made into these two kinds of cause.At the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame time, however, and even earlier the so-called Pythagoreans\n\t\t\t\t\tapplied themselves to mathematics, and were the first to develop this\n\t\t\t\t\tscience; and through\n\t\t\t\t\tstudying it they came to believe that its principles are the\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples of everything.And since  are by nature first among these\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples, and they fancied that they could detect in numbers, to a\n\t\t\t\t\tgreater extent than in fire and earth and water, many analogues of what is and comes into\n\t\t\t\t\tbeingsuch and such a property of number being\n\t\t\t\t\t , and such and such  or\n\t\t\t\t\t , another  , and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly, more or less, with all the restand since they\n\t\t\t\t\tsaw further that the properties and ratios of the musical scales are\n\t\t\t\t\tbased on numbers, and since it seemed clear that all\n\t\t\t\t\tother things have their whole nature modelled upon numbers, and that\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers are the ultimate things in the whole physical universe,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey assumed the elements of numbers to be the\n\t\t\t\t\telements of everything, and the whole universe to be a proportion or number. Whatever analogues to the\n\t\t\t\t\tprocesses and parts of the heavens and to the whole order of the\n\t\t\t\t\tuniverse they could exhibit in numbers and proportions, these they\n\t\t\t\t\tcollected and correlated;and if there was any deficiency anywhere, they made haste to supply\n\t\t\t\t\tit, in order to make their system a connected whole. For example,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince the decad is considered to be a complete thing and to comprise\n\t\t\t\t\tthe whole essential nature of the numerical system, they assert that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe bodies which revolve in the heavens are ten; and there being only\n\t\t\t\t\tnine that are\n\t\t\t\t\tvisible, they make the \"antichthon\" the tenth.We have treated this subject in greater detail\n\t\t\t\t\telsewhere; but the object of our present review is to\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscover from these thinkers too what causes they assume and how these\n\t\t\t\t\tcoincide with our list of causes.Well, it is obvious that these thinkers too\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider number to be a first principle, both as the material of things and as constituting their properties and\n\t\t\t\t\tstates. The elements of number,\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to them, are the Even and the Odd. Of these the former is\n\t\t\t\t\tlimited and the latter unlimited; Unity consists of both(since it is both odd and\n\t\t\t\t\teven); number is derived from\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity; and numbers, as we have said, compose the whole sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tuniverse.Others of this same\n\t\t\t\t\tschool hold that there are ten principles, which they enunciate in a\n\t\t\t\t\tseries of corresponding pairs: (1.) Limit and the Unlimited; (2.) Odd\n\t\t\t\t\tand Even; (3.) Unity and Plurality; (4.) Right and Left; (5.) Male and\n\t\t\t\t\tFemale; (6.) Rest and Motion; (7.) Straight and Crooked; (8.) Light\n\t\t\t\t\tand Darkness; (9.) Good and Evil; (10.) Square and Oblong.Apparently Alcmaeon of\n\t\t\t\t\t speculated\n\t\t\t\t\talong the same lines, and either he derived the theory from them or\n\t\t\t\t\tthey from him; for [Alcmaeon was contemporary with the old age of\n\t\t\t\t\tPythagoras, and] his doctrines\n\t\t\t\t\twere very similar to theirs. He says that the\n\t\t\t\t\tmajority of things in the world of men are in pairs; but the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries which he mentions are not, as in the case of the\n\t\t\t\t\tPythagoreans, carefully defined, but are taken at random, e.g. white\n\t\t\t\t\tand black, sweet and bitter, good and bad, great and small.Thus Alcmaeon only threw out\n\t\t\t\t\tvague hints with regard to the other instances of contrariety,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut the Pythagoreans pronounced how many and what\n\t\t\t\t\tthe contraries are. Thus from both these authorities we can gather thus much,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the contraries are first principles of things; and from the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer, how many and what the contraries are.How these can be referred to our list of\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses is not definitely expressed by them, but they appear to reckon\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir elements as material; for they say that these are the original\n\t\t\t\t\tconstituents of which Being is fashioned and composed.From this survey we can sufficiently understand the meaning of those\n\t\t\t\t\tancients who taught that the elements of the natural world are a\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality. Others, however, theorized about the universe as though it\n\t\t\t\t\twere a single entity; but their doctrines are not all alike either in\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint of soundness or in respect of conformity with the facts of\n\t\t\t\t\tnature.For the\n\t\t\t\t\tpurposes of our present inquiry an account of their teaching is quite\n\t\t\t\t\tirrelevant, since they do not, while assuming a unity, at the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime make out that Being is generated from the unity as from matter,\n\t\t\t\t\tas do some physicists, but give a different explanation; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tphysicists assume motion also, at any rate when explaining the\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration of the universe; but these thinkers hold that it is\n\t\t\t\t\timmovable. Nevertheless thus much is pertinent to our present\n\t\t\t\t\tinquiry.It appears\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Parmenides conceived of the Unity as one in definition,but Melissus as\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterially one. Hence the former says that it is finite, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tlatter that it is infinite. But\n\t\t\t\t\tXenophanes, the first exponent of the Unity\n\t\t\t\t\t(for Parmenides is said to have been his disciple), gave no definite\n\t\t\t\t\tteaching, nor does he seem to have grasped either of these conceptions\n\t\t\t\t\tof unity; but regarding the whole material universe he stated that the\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity is God.This school\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, as we have said, may be disregarded for the purposes of our\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent inquiry; two of them, Xenophanes and Melissus, may be\n\t\t\t\t\tcompletely ignored, as being somewhat too crude in their views.\n\t\t\t\t\tParmenides, however, seems to speak with rather more insight. For\n\t\t\t\t\tholding as he does that Not-being, as contrasted with Being, is\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing, he necessarily supposes that Being is one and that there is\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing else (we have discussed this point in greater detail in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe); but being compelled to accord with phenomena, and assuming\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Being is one in definition but many in respect of sensation, he\n\t\t\t\t\tposits in his turn two causes, i.e. two first principles, Hot and\n\t\t\t\t\tCold; or in other words, Fire and Earth. Of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese he ranks Hot under Being and the other under Not-being.From the account just given,\n\t\t\t\t\tand from a consideration of those thinkers who have already debated\n\t\t\t\t\tthis question, we have acquired the following information. From the\n\t\t\t\t\tearliest philosophers we have learned that the first principle is\n\t\t\t\t\tcorporeal (since water and fire and the like are bodies); some of them\n\t\t\t\t\tassume one and others more than one corporeal principle, but both\n\t\t\t\t\tparties agree in making these principles material. Others assume in\n\t\t\t\t\taddition to this cause the , which some\n\t\t\t\t\thold to be one and others two.Thus down to and apart from the Italian\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophers the other thinkers have expressed themselves vaguely on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subject, except that, as we have said, they actually employ two\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses, and one of thesethe source of motion\n\t\t\t\t\tsome regard as one and others as two. The Pythagoreans,\n\t\t\t\t\twhile they likewise spoke of two principles, made this further\n\t\t\t\t\taddition, which is peculiar to them: they believed, not that the\n\t\t\t\t\tLimited and the Unlimited are separate entities, like fire or water or\n\t\t\t\t\tsome other such thing, but that the Unlimited itself and the One\n\t\t\t\t\titself are the essence of those things of which they are predicated,\n\t\t\t\t\tand hence that number is the essence of all things.Such is the nature of their pronouncements on\n\t\t\t\t\tthis subject. They also began to discuss and define the \"what\" of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings; but their procedure was far too simple. They defined\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperficially, and supposed that the essence of a thing is that to\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the term under consideration first appliese.g. as if\n\t\t\t\t\tit were to be thought that \"double\" and \"2\" are the same, because 2 is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first number which is double another.But presumably \"to be double a number\" is not\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same as \"to be the number 2.\" Otherwise, one thing will be\n\t\t\t\t\tmanya consequence which actually followed in their\n\t\t\t\t\tsystem. This much, then, can be learned from other and\n\t\t\t\t\tearlier schools of thought.The philosophies described\n\t\t\t\t\tabove were succeeded by the system of Plato, which in most respects accorded with\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, but contained also certain peculiar features distinct from the\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy of the Italians.In his youth Plato first became acquainted with Cratylus and the Heraclitean\n\t\t\t\t\tdoctrinesthat the whole sensible world is always in a state\n\t\t\t\t\tof flux, and that there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tscientific knowledge of itand in after years he still held\n\t\t\t\t\tthese opinions. And when Socrates, disregarding the\n\t\t\t\t\tphysical universe and confining his study to moral questions, sought\n\t\t\t\t\tin this sphere for the universal and was the first to concentrate upon\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition, Plato followed him and assumed that the problem of\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition is concerned not with any sensible thing but with entities\n\t\t\t\t\tof another kind; for the reason that there can be no general\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition of sensible things which are always changing.These entities he called\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Ideas,\" and\n\t\t\t\t\theld that all sensible things are named after them sensible and\n\t\t\t\t\tin virtue of their relation to them; for the plurality of things which\n\t\t\t\t\tbear the same name as the Forms exist by participation in them. (With\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to the \"participation,\" it was only the term that he changed;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor whereas the Pythagoreans say that things exist by imitation of\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers, Plato says that they exist by participationmerely\n\t\t\t\t\ta change of term.As to\n\t\t\t\t\twhat this \"participation\" or \"imitation\" may be, they left this an\n\t\t\t\t\topen question.)Further, he states that\n\t\t\t\t\tbesides sensible things and the Forms there exists an intermediate\n\t\t\t\t\tclass, the , which differ from sensible things in being\n\t\t\t\t\teternal and immutable, and from the Forms in that there are many\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar objects of mathematics, whereas each Form is itself\n\t\t\t\t\tunique.Now since the Forms are the causes of\n\t\t\t\t\teverything else, he supposed that their elements are the elements of\n\t\t\t\t\tall things.Accordingly the\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterial principle is the \"Great and Small,\" and the essence\n\t\t\t\t\t<or formal principle> is the One, since the numbers are\n\t\t\t\t\tderived from the \"Great and Small\" by participation in the the\n\t\t\t\t\tOne.In treating the\n\t\t\t\t\tOne as a substance instead of a predicate of some other entity, his\n\t\t\t\t\tteaching resembles that of the Pythagoreans, and also agrees with it\n\t\t\t\t\tin stating that the numbers are the causes of Being in everything\n\t\t\t\t\telse; but it is peculiar to him to posit a duality instead of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsingle Unlimited, and to make the Unlimited consist of the \"Great and\n\t\t\t\t\tSmall.\" He is also peculiar in regarding the numbers as distinct from\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible things, whereas they hold that things themselves are numbers,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor do they posit an intermediate class of mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects.His\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinction of the One and the numbers from ordinary things (in which\n\t\t\t\t\the differed from the Pythagoreans) and his introduction of the Forms\n\t\t\t\t\twere due to his investigation of logic (the earlier thinkers were\n\t\t\t\t\tstrangers to Dialectic); his conception\n\t\t\t\t\tof the other principle as a duality to the belief that numbers other\n\t\t\t\t\tthan primes can be\n\t\t\t\t\treadily generated from it, as from a matrix.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe\n\t\t\t\t\tfact, however, is just the reverse, and the theory is illogical; for\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas the Platonists derive multiplicity from matter although their\n\t\t\t\t\tForm generates only once, it is obvious\n\t\t\t\t\tthat only one table can be made from one piece of timber, and yet he\n\t\t\t\t\twho imposes the form upon it, although he is but one, can make many\n\t\t\t\t\ttables. Such too is the relation of male to female: the female is\n\t\t\t\t\timpregnated in one coition, but one male can impregnate many females.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd these relations are analogues of the principles referred\n\t\t\t\t\tto.This, then, is Plato's verdict upon the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion which we are investigating. From this account it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he only employed two causes: that of the essence, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterial cause; for the Forms are the cause of the essence in\n\t\t\t\t\teverything else, and the One is the cause of it in the\n\t\t\t\t\tForms.He also tells\n\t\t\t\t\tus what the material substrate is of which the Forms are predicated in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case of sensible things, and the One in that of the\n\t\t\t\t\tFormsthat it is this the duality, the \"Great and Small.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tFurther, he assigned to these two elements respectively the causation\n\t\t\t\t\tof good and of evil; a problem which,\n\t\t\t\t\tas we have said, had also been\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidered by some of the earlier philosophers, e.g. Empedocles and\n\t\t\t\t\tAnaxagoras.We have given only a concise and\n\t\t\t\t\tsummary account of those thinkers who have expressed views about the\n\t\t\t\t\tcausesand reality,\n\t\t\t\t\tand of their doctrines. Nevertheless we have learned thus much from\n\t\t\t\t\tthem: that not one of those who discuss principle or cause has\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned any other type than those which we we have distinguished in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe . Clearly it is after these types that they are groping, however\n\t\t\t\t\tuncertainly.Some\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak of the first principle as material, whether they regard it as\n\t\t\t\t\tone or several, as corporeal or incorporeal: e.g. Plato speaks of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Great and Small\"; the Italians of the Unlimited; Empedocles of Fire, Earth,\n\t\t\t\t\tWater and Air; Anaxagoras of the infinity of homoeomeries.All these have apprehended this\n\t\t\t\t\ttype of cause; and all those too who make their first principle air or\n\t\t\t\t\twater or \"something denser than fire but rarer than air\"(for some have so\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribed the primary element). These, then, apprehended this cause\n\t\t\t\t\tonly, but others apprehended the e.g. all such as make Love and Strife, or\n\t\t\t\t\tMind, or Desire a first principle.As for the  or\n\t\t\t\t\t, nobody has definitely introduced\n\t\t\t\t\tit; but the inventors of the Forms express it most\n\t\t\t\t\tnearly. For they do not conceive of the Forms as the\n\t\t\t\t\t of sensible things (and the One as the matter of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Forms), nor as producing the  (for\n\t\t\t\t\tthey hold that they are rather the cause of immobility and\n\t\t\t\t\ttranquillity); but they adduce the Forms as the  of all other things, and the One as that of the\n\t\t\t\t\tForms.The\n\t\t\t\t\t towards which actions, changes and motions tend they\n\t\t\t\t\tdo in a way treat as a cause, but not in this sense, i.e. not in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsense in which it is naturally a cause. Those who speak of Mind or\n\t\t\t\t\tLove assume these causes as being something good; but nevertheless\n\t\t\t\t\tthey do not profess that anything exists or is generated  of them, but only that motions originate from\n\t\t\t\t\tthem.Similarly also those who hold that Unity or Being is an entity of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis kind state that it is the cause of existence, but not that things\n\t\t\t\t\texist or are generated for the sake of it. So it follows that in a\n\t\t\t\t\tsense they both assert and deny that the Good is a cause; for they\n\t\t\t\t\ttreat it as such not absolutely, but incidentally.It appears, then, that all these\n\t\t\t\t\tthinkers too (being unable to arrive at any other cause) testify that\n\t\t\t\t\twe have classified the causes rightly, as regards both number and\n\t\t\t\t\tnature. Further, it is clear that all the principles must be sought\n\t\t\t\t\teither along these lines or in some similar way.Let us\n\t\t\t\t\tnext examine the possible difficulties arising out of the statements\n\t\t\t\t\tof each of these thinkers, and out of his attitude to the first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples.All those who regard the universe as a\n\t\t\t\t\tunity, and assume as its matter some one nature, and that corporeal\n\t\t\t\t\tand extended, are clearly mistaken in many respects. They only assume\n\t\t\t\t\telements of corporeal things, and not of incorporeal ones, which also\n\t\t\t\t\texist. They attempt to state the causes of generation and destruction,\n\t\t\t\t\tand investigate the nature of everything; and at the same time do away\n\t\t\t\t\twith the cause of motion.Then there is their failure to regard the  or\n\t\t\t\t\tformula as a cause of anything; and further their readiness to call\n\t\t\t\t\tany one of the simple bodiesexcept eartha first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple, without inquiring how their reciprocal generation is\n\t\t\t\t\teffected. I refer to fire, water, earth and air. Of these some are\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated from each other by combination and others by\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiation;and\n\t\t\t\t\tthis difference is of the greatest importance in deciding their\n\t\t\t\t\trelative priority. In one way it might seem that the most elementary\n\t\t\t\t\tbody is that from which first other bodies are produced by\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination; and this will be that body which is\n\t\t\t\t\trarest and composed of the finest particles.Hence all who posit Fire as first principle\n\t\t\t\t\twill be in the closest agreement with this theory. However, even among\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other thinkers everyone agrees that the primary corporeal element\n\t\t\t\t\tis of this kind. At any rate none of the Monists thought earth likely\n\t\t\t\t\tto be an elementobviously on account of the size of its\n\t\t\t\t\tparticlesbut each of the other three has had an advocate; for some name fire\n\t\t\t\t\tas the primary element, others water, and others air. And yet why do they not suggest\n\t\t\t\t\tearth too, as common opinion does? for people say \"Everything is\n\t\t\t\t\tearth.\"And Hesiod\n\t\t\t\t\ttoo says\n\t\t\t\t\tthat earth was generated first of corporeal thingsso\n\t\t\t\t\tancient and popular is the conception found to be. Thus according to\n\t\t\t\t\tthis theory anyone who suggests any of these bodies other than fire,\n\t\t\t\t\tor who assumes something \"denser than air but rarer than water,\" will be wrong.On the other hand if what is posterior\n\t\t\t\t\tin generation is prior in nature, and that which is developed and\n\t\t\t\t\tcombined is posterior in generation, then the reverse will be the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase; water will be prior to air, and earth to water. So much for\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who posit  cause such as we have\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribed.The same will apply too if anyone\n\t\t\t\t\tposits more than one, as e.g. Empedocles says that matter consists of\n\t\t\t\t\tfour bodies;objections\n\t\t\t\t\tmust occur in his case also, some the same as before, and some\n\t\t\t\t\tpeculiar to him. First, we can see things being generated from each\n\t\t\t\t\tother in a way which shows that fire and earth do not persist as the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame corporeal entity. (This subject has been treated in my works on\n\t\t\t\t\tNatural Science.) Again with regard to the cause of motion in\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, whether one or two should be assumed, it must not be thought\n\t\t\t\t\tthat his account is entirely correct or even reasonable.And in general those who hold such views as\n\t\t\t\t\tthese must of necessity do away with qualitative alteration; for on\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch a theory cold will not come from hot nor hot from cold, because\n\t\t\t\t\tto effect this there must be something which actually takes on these\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary qualities: some single element which becomes both fire and\n\t\t\t\t\twaterwhich Empedocles denies.If one were to\n\t\t\t\t\tinfer that Anaxagoras recognized two elements, the inference would accord closely\n\t\t\t\t\twith a view which, although he did not articulate it himself, he must\n\t\t\t\t\thave accepted as developed by others.To say that originally everything was a\n\t\t\t\t\tmixture is absurd for various reasons, but\n\t\t\t\t\tespecially since (a) it follows that things must have existed\n\t\t\t\t\tpreviously in an unmixed state; (b) it is contrary to nature for\n\t\t\t\t\t to mix with  ; (c)\n\t\t\t\t\tmoreover affections and attributes would then be separable from their\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances (because what is mixed can also be separated). At the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime, if one were to follow his doctrine carefully and interpret its\n\t\t\t\t\tmeaning, perhaps it would be seen to be more up-to-date;because when nothing was yet\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiated, obviously nothing could be truly predicated of that\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstancee.g. that it was white or black or buff or any\n\t\t\t\t\tother color. It must necessarily have been colorless, since otherwise\n\t\t\t\t\tit would have had one of these colors.Similarly by the same argument it had no taste\n\t\t\t\t\tor any other such attribute; for it cannot have had any quality or\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnitude or individuality. Otherwise some particular form would have\n\t\t\t\t\tbelonged to it; but this is impossible on the assumption that\n\t\t\t\t\teverything was mixed together, for then the form would have been\n\t\t\t\t\talready differentiated, whereas he says that everything was mixed\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether except Mind, which alone was pure and unmixed.It follows from this that he\n\t\t\t\t\trecognizes as principles the One (which is simple and unmixed) and the\n\t\t\t\t\tOther, which is such as we suppose the Indeterminate to be before it\n\t\t\t\t\tis determined and partakes of some form. Thus his account is neither\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrect nor clear,but his\n\t\t\t\t\tmeaning approximates to more recent theories and what is now more\n\t\t\t\t\tobviously true.However, these thinkers are really\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned only with the theories of generation and destruction and\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion (for in general it is only with reference to this aspect of\n\t\t\t\t\treality that they look for their principles and causes).Those, however, who make their\n\t\t\t\t\tstudy cover the whole of reality, and who distinguish between sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tand non-sensible objects, clearly give their attention to both kinds;\n\t\t\t\t\thence in their case we may consider at greater length what\n\t\t\t\t\tcontributions, valuable or otherwise, they make to the inquiry which\n\t\t\t\t\tis now before us.The so-called Pythagoreans employ\n\t\t\t\t\tabstruser principles and elements than the physicists. The reason is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they did not draw them from the sensible world; for mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects, apart from those which are connected with astronomy, are\n\t\t\t\t\tdevoid of motion.Nevertheless all their discussions and investigations are concerned\n\t\t\t\t\twith the physical world. They account for the generation of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible universe, and observe what happens in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect of its parts and affections and activities, and they use up\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir principles and causes in this connection, as though they agreed\n\t\t\t\t\twith the othersthe physiciststhat reality is\n\t\t\t\t\tjust so much as is sensible and is contained in the so-called\n\t\t\t\t\t\"heavens.\"All the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame, as we have said, the causes and\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples which they describe are capable of application to the\n\t\t\t\t\tremoter class of realities as well, and indeed are better fitted to\n\t\t\t\t\tthese than to their physical theories.But as to how there is to be motion, if all\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is premissed is Limit and the Unlimited, and Odd and Even, they\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not even hint; nor how, without motion and change, there can be\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration and destruction, or the activities of the bodies which\n\t\t\t\t\ttraverse the heavens.And\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther, assuming that it be granted to them or proved by them that\n\t\t\t\t\t is\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of these factors, yet how is it to be explained that some\n\t\t\t\t\tbodies are light, and others have weight? For in their premisses and\n\t\t\t\t\tstatements they are speaking just as much about sensible as about\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical objects; and this is why they have made no mention of\n\t\t\t\t\tfire or earth or other similar bodies, because, I presume, they have\n\t\t\t\t\tno separate explanation of sensible things.Again, how are we to understand that number\n\t\t\t\t\tand the modifications of number are the causesof all being and generation, both in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning and now, and at the same time that there is no other\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber than the number of which the universe is composed?Because when they make out that Opinion\n\t\t\t\t\tand Opportunity are in such and such a region, and a little above or\n\t\t\t\t\tbelow them Injustice and Separation or Mixture, and when they state as\n\t\t\t\t\tproof of this that each of these abstractions is a number; and that\n\t\t\t\t\talso in this region there is already a plurality of the magnitudes\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of number, inasmuch as these modifications of number\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrespond to these several regions,is the number which we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust understand each of these abstractions to be the same number which\n\t\t\t\t\tis present in the sensible universe, or another kind of number?Plato at least says that it is another. It is\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue that he too supposes that numbers are both these magnitudes and\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir causes; but in his view the causative numbers are intelligible\n\t\t\t\t\tand the others sensible.The Pythagoreans, then, may be\n\t\t\t\t\tdismissed for the present, for it is enough to touch upon them thus\n\t\t\t\t\tbriefly. As for those who posit the Forms as\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses, in the first place in their\n\t\t\t\t\tattempt to find the causes of things in our sensible world, they\n\t\t\t\t\tintroduced an equal number of other entitiesas though a man\n\t\t\t\t\twho wishes to count things should suppose that it would be impossible\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they are few, and should attempt to count them when he has added\n\t\t\t\t\tto them. For the Forms are as many as, or not fewer than, the things\n\t\t\t\t\tin search of whose causes these thinkers were led to the Forms;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause corresponding to each thing there is a synonymous entity apart\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the substances (and in the case of non-substantial things there\n\t\t\t\t\tis a One over the Many), both in our\n\t\t\t\t\teveryday world and in the realm of eternal entities.Again, not one of the arguments by\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we try to prove that the Forms exist demonstrates\n\t\t\t\t\tour point: from some of them no necessary conclusion follows, and from\n\t\t\t\t\tothers it follows that there are Forms of things of which we hold that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are no Forms.For\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to the arguments from the sciences there will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe Forms of all things of which there are sciences; and according to the \"One-over-Many\"\n\t\t\t\t\targument, of negations too; and according to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe argument that \"we have some conception of what has perished,\" of\n\t\t\t\t\tperishable things; because we have a mental picture of these\n\t\t\t\t\tthings. Again, of Plato's more\n\t\t\t\t\texact arguments some establish Ideas of relations, which we do not hold to form a separate\n\t\t\t\t\tgenus;and others\n\t\t\t\t\tstate the \"Third Man.\" And\n\t\t\t\t\tin general the arguments for the Forms do away with things which are\n\t\t\t\t\tmore important to us exponents of the Forms than the existence of the\n\t\t\t\t\tIdeas;for they imply\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is not the Dyad that is primary, but Number; and that the relative is\n\t\t\t\t\tprior to the absolute; and all the other conclusions in respect of which\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain persons, by following up the views held about the Ideas, have\n\t\t\t\t\tgone against the principles of the theory.Again,\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to the assumption by which we hold that the Ideas exist,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere will be Forms not only of substances but of many other things\n\t\t\t\t\t(since the concept is one not only in the case of substances, but also\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of all other things; and there are sciences not only of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances but of other things as well; and there are a thousand other\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar consequences); but according to logical necessity, and from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe views generally held about them, it follows that if the Forms are\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipated in, then there can only be Ideas of substances. For they\n\t\t\t\t\tare not participated in  accidents; each\n\t\t\t\t\tForm can only be participated in in so far as it is not predicated of\n\t\t\t\t\ta subject.I mean, e.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat if anything participates in \"absolute Doubleness\" it participates\n\t\t\t\t\talso in \"eternal,\" but only accidentally; because it is an\n\t\t\t\t\t of Doubleness to be eternal.Thus the Forms must be substance. But the same names denote\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance in the sensible as in the Ideal world; otherwise what meaning will there be in saying that something exists\n\t\t\t\t\tbeside the particulars, i.e. the unity comprising their\n\t\t\t\t\tmultiplicity?If the\n\t\t\t\t\tform of the Ideas and of the things which participate in them is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame, they will have something in common (for why should Duality mean\n\t\t\t\t\tone and the same thing in the case of perishable \"twos\" and the \"twos\" which are many but eternal,\n\t\t\t\t\tand not in the case of the Idea of Duality and a particular \"two\"?);\n\t\t\t\t\tbut if the form is not the same, they will simply be homonyms; just as\n\t\t\t\t\tthough one were to call both Callias and a piece of wood \"man,\"\n\t\t\t\t\twithout remarking any property common to them.Above\n\t\t\t\t\tall we might examine the question what on earth the Forms contribute\n\t\t\t\t\tto sensible things, whether eternal or subject to generation and\n\t\t\t\t\tdecay; for they are not the cause of any motion or change in\n\t\t\t\t\tthem.Again, they\n\t\t\t\t\tare no help towards the  of other things(for they are not the substance of things,\n\t\t\t\t\totherwise they would be  things), nor to their\n\t\t\t\t\texistence, since they are not present in the things which partake of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem. If they were, it might perhaps seem that they are causes, in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsense in which the admixture of white causes a thing to be\n\t\t\t\t\twhite;but this\n\t\t\t\t\ttheory, which was first stated by Anaxagoras and later by Eudoxus and others, is very readily refutable, for\n\t\t\t\t\tit is easy to adduce plenty of impossibilities against such a view.\n\t\t\t\t\tAgain, other things are notin any accepted sense  from the Forms.To say that the Forms are\n\t\t\t\t\tpatterns, and that other things participate in them, is to use empty\n\t\t\t\t\tphrases and poetical metaphors; for what is it that fashions things on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe model of the Ideas Besides, anything may\n\t\t\t\t\tboth be and become like something else without being imitated from it;\n\t\t\t\t\tthus a man may become just like\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates whether\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates exists or not,and even if\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates were eternal, clearly the case would be\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same. Also there will be several \"patterns,\" and hence Forms, of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same thing; e.g. \"animal\" and \"two-footed\" will be patterns of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"man,\" and so too will the Idea of Man.Further, the Forms will be\n\t\t\t\t\tpatterns not only of sensible things but of themselves (e.g. genus in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sense of genus of species), and thus the same thing will be both\n\t\t\t\t\tpattern and copy.\n\t\t\t\t\tFurther, it would seem impossible that the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance and the thing of which it is the substance exist in\n\t\t\t\t\tseparation; hence how can the Ideas, if they are the substances of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, exist in separation from them? It is stated in the\n\t\t\t\t\t that the\n\t\t\t\t\tForms are the causes both of existence and of generation.Yet, assuming that the Forms\n\t\t\t\t\texist, still the things which participate in them are not generated\n\t\t\t\t\tunless there is something to impart motion; while many other things\n\t\t\t\t\t generated (e.g. house, ring) of which we hold\n\t\t\t\t\tthat there are no Forms. Thus it is clearly possible that all other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings may both exist and be generated for the same causes as the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings just mentioned.Further, if the Forms are\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers, in what sense will they be causes? Is it because things are\n\t\t\t\t\tother numbers, e.g. such and such a number Man, such and such another\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates, such and such\n\t\t\t\t\tanother Callias? then why are those numbers the causes of these? Even\n\t\t\t\t\tif the one class is eternal and the other not, it will make no\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference.And if\n\t\t\t\t\tit is because the things of our world are ratios of numbers (e.g. a\n\t\t\t\t\tmusical concord), clearly there is some one class of things of which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are ratios. Now if there is this something, i.e. their\n\t\t\t\t\t , clearly the numbers themselves will be\n\t\t\t\t\tratios of one thing to another.I mean, e.g., that if Callias is a numerical\n\t\t\t\t\tratio of fire, earth, water and air, the corresponding Idea too will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe a number of certain other things which are its substrate. The Idea\n\t\t\t\t\tof Man, too, whether it is in a sense a number or not, will yet be an\n\t\t\t\t\tarithmetical ratio of certain things,and not a mere number; nor, on these grounds, will\n\t\t\t\t\tany Idea be a number.Again,\n\t\t\t\t\tone number can be composed of several numbers, but how can one Form be\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of several Forms? And if the one number is not composed of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other numbers themselves, but of their constituents (e.g. those of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe number 10,000), what is the relation of the units? If they are\n\t\t\t\t\tspecifically alike, many absurdities will result, and also if they are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot (whether (a) the units in a given number are unlike, or (b) the\n\t\t\t\t\tunits in each number are unlike those in every other number). For in\n\t\t\t\t\twhat can they differ, seeing that they have no qualities? Such a view\n\t\t\t\t\tis neither reasonable nor compatible with our conception of\n\t\t\t\t\tunits.Further, it becomes necessary to set up\n\t\t\t\t\tanother kind of number (with which calculation deals), and all the\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects which are called \"intermediate\" by some thinkers. But how or\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom what principles can these be derived? or on what grounds are they\n\t\t\t\t\tto be considered intermediate between things  and\n\t\t\t\t\tIdeal numbers? Further, each of the units in the number 2 comes from a\n\t\t\t\t\tprior 2; but this is impossible.\n\t\t\t\t\tFurther, why should a number <of\n\t\t\t\t\tunits>, taken together, be one thing? And further, in addition\n\t\t\t\t\tto the above objections, if the units are unlike, they should be\n\t\t\t\t\ttreated as the thinkers who assume two or four elements treat those\n\t\t\t\t\telements; for not one of them applies the term \"element\" to the common\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstrate, e.g. body, but to fire and earthwhether there is\n\t\t\t\t\ta common substrate (i.e. body) or not.As it\n\t\t\t\t\tis, the One is spoken of as though it were homogeneous, like fire or\n\t\t\t\t\twater. But if this is so, the numbers will not be substances. And if\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is an absolute One which is a principle, clearly the term \"one\"\n\t\t\t\t\tis ambiguous; otherwise this is impossible.When we wish to refer\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances to their principles we derive lines from \"Long and Short,\" a kind of \"Great and\n\t\t\t\t\tSmall\"; and the plane from \"Wide and Narrow,\" and the solid body from\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Deep and Shallow.\" But in this case how can the plane contain a\n\t\t\t\t\tline,or the solid a\n\t\t\t\t\tline and a plane? for \"Wide and Narrow\" and \"Deep and Shallow\" are\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent genera. Nor is Number contained in these objects (because\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Many and Few\" is yet another class); and in the same way it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tthat none of the other higher genera will be contained in the lower.\n\t\t\t\t\tNor, again, is the Broad the genus of which the Deep is a species; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthen body would be a kind of plane.Further, how will it be possible for figures to contain points? Plato steadily rejected this class\n\t\t\t\t\tof objects as a geometrical fiction, but he recognized \"the beginning\n\t\t\t\t\tof a line,\" and he frequently assumed this latter class, i.e. the \"\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible lines.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tBut these must have some limit; and so by the same argument which\n\t\t\t\t\tproves the existence of the line, the point also exists.In general, although Wisdom is\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned with the cause of visible things, we have ignored this\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion (for we have no account to give of the cause from which\n\t\t\t\t\tchange arises), and\n\t\t\t\t\tin the belief that we are accounting for their substance we assert the\n\t\t\t\t\texistence of other substances; but as to  the latter\n\t\t\t\t\tare the substances of the former, our explanation is\n\t\t\t\t\tworthlessfor \"participation,\" as we have said before, means\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing.And as for\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which we can see to be the cause in the sciences, and through\n\t\t\t\t\twhich all mind and all nature worksthis cause which we hold\n\t\t\t\t\tto be one of the first principlesthe Forms have not the\n\t\t\t\t\tslightest bearing upon it either. Philosophy has become mathematics\n\t\t\t\t\tfor modern thinkers, although they profess\n\t\t\t\t\tthat mathematics is only to be studied as a means to some other end.\n\t\t\t\t\tFurther, one might regard the substance\n\t\t\t\t\twhich they make the material substrate as too mathematical, and as\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing a predicate and differentia of substance or matter rather than\n\t\t\t\t\tas matter itself, I mean the \"Great and Small,\" which is like the\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Rare and Dense\" of which the physicists speak, holding that they are the\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary differentiae of the substrate; because these qualities are a\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies of excess and defect.Also with regard to motion, if the \"Great and\n\t\t\t\t\tSmall\" is to constitute motion, obviously the Forms will be moved; if\n\t\t\t\t\tnot, whence did it come? On this view the whole study of physics is\n\t\t\t\t\tabolished. And what is supposed to be easy, to prove that everything\n\t\t\t\t\tis One, does not follow; because from their exposition it\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not follow, even if you grant them all their assumptions that\n\t\t\t\t\teverything is One, but only that there is an absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tOneand\n\t\t\t\t\tnot even this, unless you grant that the universal is a class; which\n\t\t\t\t\tis impossible in some cases. Nor\n\t\t\t\t\tis there any explanation of the lines, planes and solids which \"come\n\t\t\t\t\tafter\" the Numbers: neither as to how they exist or can exist, nor as\n\t\t\t\t\tto what their importance is. They cannot be Forms (since they are not\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers) or Intermediates (which are the objects of mathematics) or\n\t\t\t\t\tperishables; clearly they form yet another fourth class.In general, to investigate the elements of existing things without\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinguishing the various senses in which things are said to exist is\n\t\t\t\t\ta hopeless task;especially\n\t\t\t\t\twhen one inquires along these lines into the nature of the elements of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich things are composed. For (a) we cannot surely conceive of the\n\t\t\t\t\telements of activity or passivity or straightness; this is possible,\n\t\t\t\t\tif at all, only in the case of substances. Hence to look for, or to\n\t\t\t\t\tsuppose that one has found, the elements of \n\t\t\t\t\tthat exists, is a mistake.(b) How  one apprehend the elements of\n\t\t\t\t\t ? Obviously one could not have any\n\t\t\t\t\tprevious knowledge of anything; because just as a man who is beginning\n\t\t\t\t\tto learn geometry can have previous knowledge of other facts, but no\n\t\t\t\t\tprevious knowledge of the principles of that science or of the things\n\t\t\t\t\tabout which he is to learn, so it is in the case of all other branches\n\t\t\t\t\tof knowledge.Hence if\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is a science which embraces everything(as\n\t\t\t\t\tsome say), the student of it can have no previous knowledge at all.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut all learning proceeds, wholly or in part, from what is already\n\t\t\t\t\tknown; whether it is through demonstration or through\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinitionsince the parts of the definition must be already\n\t\t\t\t\tknown and familiar. The same is true of induction. On the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand, assuming that this knowledge should turn out to be innate, it is astonishing that we should possess\n\t\t\t\t\tunawares the most important of the sciences. Further, how is one to\n\t\t\t\t\t of what elements things consist? how is it to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe established?Even this\n\t\t\t\t\tpresents a difficulty, because the facts might be disputed, as happens\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of certain syllablesfor some say that ZA is\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of S, D and A, while others say that it is a distinct sound\n\t\t\t\t\tand not any one of those which are familiar to us.Further, how can one gain\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge of the objects of a particular sense-perception without\n\t\t\t\t\tpossessing that sense? Yet it should be possible, that if the elements\n\t\t\t\t\tof which all things consist, as composite sounds consist of their\n\t\t\t\t\tpeculiar elements, are the same.Thus it is obvious, from the statements of earlier thinkers also,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat all inquiry is apparently directed towards the causes described\n\t\t\t\t\tin the , and that we cannot suggest any other cause apart from\n\t\t\t\t\tthese. They were, however, only vaguely conceived; and although in one\n\t\t\t\t\tsense they have all been stated before, in another they have not been\n\t\t\t\t\tstated at all.For the\n\t\t\t\t\tearliest philosophy speaks falteringly, as it were, on all subjects;\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing new and in its infancy. Even Empedocles says that bone exists by\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue of its ratio,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is the definition or essence of a thing.But by similar reasoning both flesh and\n\t\t\t\t\tevery other thing,or else\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing at all, must be ratio; for it must be because of this, and not\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause of their matterwhich he calls fire, earth, water\n\t\t\t\t\tand airthat flesh and bone and every other thing\n\t\t\t\t\texists.If anyone\n\t\t\t\t\telse had stated this, he would necessarily have agreed, but his own\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement was not clear.These and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar points have been explained already.

This is shown by the fact that whereas no\n\t\t\t\t\tone person can obtain an adequate grasp of it, we cannot\n\t\t\t\t\t fail in the attempt; each\n\t\t\t\t\tthinker makes some statement about the natural world, and as an\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual contributes little or nothing to the inquiry; but a\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination of all conjectures results in something\n\t\t\t\t\tconsiderable.Thus in\n\t\t\t\t\tso far as it seems that Truth is like the proverbial door which no one\n\t\t\t\t\tcan miss, in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis sense our study will be easy; but the fact that we cannot,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough having some grasp of the whole, grasp a particular part,\n\t\t\t\t\tshows its difficulty. However, since difficulty also can be accounted\n\t\t\t\t\tfor in two ways, its cause may exist not in the objects of our study\n\t\t\t\t\tbut in ourselves:just as\n\t\t\t\t\tit is with bats' eyes in respect of daylight, so it is with our mental\n\t\t\t\t\tintelligence in respect of those things which are by nature most\n\t\t\t\t\tobvious.It is only fair to be\n\t\t\t\t\tgrateful not only to those whose views we can share but also to those\n\t\t\t\t\twho have expressed rather superficial opinions. They too have\n\t\t\t\t\tcontributed something; by their preliminary work they have formed our\n\t\t\t\t\tmental experience.If there\n\t\t\t\t\thad been no Timotheus, we\n\t\t\t\t\tshould not possess much of our music; and if there had been no\n\t\t\t\t\tPhrynis, there would have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen no Timotheus. It is just the same in the case of those who have\n\t\t\t\t\ttheorized about reality: we have derived certain views from some of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, and they in turn were indebted to others.Moreover, philosophy is rightly calleda knowledge of Truth. The object of theoretic\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge is truth, while that of practical knowledge is action; for\n\t\t\t\t\teven when they are investigating  a thing is so,\n\t\t\t\t\tpractical men study not the eternal principle but the relative and\n\t\t\t\t\timmediate application.But\n\t\t\t\t\twe cannot know the truth apart from the cause. Now every thing through\n\t\t\t\t\twhich a common quality is communicated to other things is itself of\n\t\t\t\t\tall those things in the highest degree possessed of that quality (e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tfire is hottest, because it is the cause of heat in everything else);\n\t\t\t\t\thence that also is most true which causes all subsequent things to be\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue.Therefore in\n\t\t\t\t\tevery case the first principles of things must necessarily be true\n\t\t\t\t\tabove everything elsesince they are not merely\n\t\t\t\t\t true, nor is anything the cause of their\n\t\t\t\t\texistence, but they are the cause of the existence of other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings,and so as each thing is in respect of existence, so\n\t\t\t\t\tit is in respect of truth. Moreover, it is obvious that there is some first principle, and that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe causes of things are not infinitely many either in a direct\n\t\t\t\t\tsequence or in kind. For the material generation of one thing from\n\t\t\t\t\tanother cannot go on in an infinite progression (e.g. flesh from\n\t\t\t\t\tearth, earth from air, air from fire, and so on without a stop); nor\n\t\t\t\t\tcan the source of motion (e.g. man be moved by air, air by the sun,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sun by Strife, with no limit\n\t\t\t\t\tto the series).In the same\n\t\t\t\t\tway neither can the Final Cause recede to infinitywalking\n\t\t\t\t\thaving health for its object, and health happiness, and happiness\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else: one thing always being done for the sake of\n\t\t\t\t\tanother.And it is\n\t\t\t\t\tjust the same with the Formal Cause. For in the case of all\n\t\t\t\t\tintermediate terms of a series which are contained between a first and\n\t\t\t\t\tlast term, the prior term is necessarily the cause of those which\n\t\t\t\t\tfollow it; because if we had to say which of the three is the cause,\n\t\t\t\t\twe should say \"the first.\" At any rate it is not the last term,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause what comes at the end is not the cause of anything. Neither,\n\t\t\t\t\tagain, is the intermediate term, which is only the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tone(and it makes no\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference whether there is one intermediate term or several, nor\n\t\t\t\t\twhether they are infinite or limited in number). But of series which\n\t\t\t\t\tare infinite in this way, and in general of the infinite, all the\n\t\t\t\t\tparts are equally intermediate, down to the present moment. Thus if\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is no first term, there is no cause at all.On the\n\t\t\t\t\tother hand there can be no infinite progression downwards(where there is a beginning in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe upper direction) such that from fire comes water, and from water\n\t\t\t\t\tearth, and in this way some other kind of thing is always being\n\t\t\t\t\tproduced. There are two senses in which one thing \"comes from\"\n\t\t\t\t\tanotherapart from that in which one thing is said to come\n\t\t\t\t\t another, e.g. the Olympian \"from\" the Isthmian\n\t\t\t\t\tgameseither as a man comes from a child as it develops, or\n\t\t\t\t\tas air comes from water.Now we say that a man \"comes from\" a child in the sense that that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich  become something comes from that which\n\t\t\t\t\t becoming: i.e. the perfect from the imperfect. (For\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as \"becoming\" is always intermediate between being and not-being,\n\t\t\t\t\tso is that which is becoming between what is and what is not. The\n\t\t\t\t\tlearner is becoming informed, and that is the meaning of the statement\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the informed person \"comes from\" the learner.)On the other hand A comes from B in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsense that water comes from air by the destruction of B. Hence the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer class of process is not reversible (e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\ta child cannot come from a man, for the result of the process of\n\t\t\t\t\tbecoming is not the thing which is becoming, but that which exists\n\t\t\t\t\tafter the process is complete. So day comes from early dawn, because\n\t\t\t\t\tit is after dawn; and hence dawn does not come from day). But the\n\t\t\t\t\tother class is reversible.In both cases progression to infinity is impossible; for in the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer the intermediate terms must have an end, and in the second the\n\t\t\t\t\tprocess is reversible, for the destruction of one member of a pair is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe generation of the other. At the same time the first cause, being\n\t\t\t\t\teternal, cannot be destroyed; because, since the process of generation\n\t\t\t\t\tis not infinite in the upper direction, that cause which first, on its\n\t\t\t\t\tdestruction, became something else, cannot possibly be eternal.Further, the Final cause of a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is an  , and is such that it does not happen for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of some thing else, but all other things happen for its sake.\n\t\t\t\t\tSo if there is to be a last term of this kind, the series will not be\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite; and if there is no such term, there will be no Final cause.\n\t\t\t\t\tThose who introduce infinity do not realize that they are abolishing\n\t\t\t\t\tthe nature of the Good (although no one would attempt to do anything\n\t\t\t\t\tif he were not likely to reach some limit);nor would there be any intelligence in the\n\t\t\t\t\tworld, because the man who has intelligence always acts for the sake\n\t\t\t\t\tof something, and this is a limit, because the  is a\n\t\t\t\t\tlimit.Nor again can the Formal\n\t\t\t\t\tcause be referred back to another fuller definition;for the prior definition is\n\t\t\t\t\talways closer, and the posterior is not; and where the original\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition does not apply, neither does the subsequent one.Further, those who hold such a\n\t\t\t\t\tview do away with scientific knowledge, for on this view it is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible to know anything until one comes to terms which cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\tanalyzed.Understanding, too, is impossible; for how can one conceive of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which are infinite in this way? It is different in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe line, which, although in respect of divisibility it never stops,\n\t\t\t\t\tyet cannot be conceived of unless we make a stop (which is why, in\n\t\t\t\t\texamining an infinite line, one cannot count the\n\t\t\t\t\tsections).Even matter has to be conceived under\n\t\t\t\t\tthe form of something which changes, and there can be nothing which is infinite. In any case the concept of infinity is not\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite.Again, if the\n\t\t\t\t\tkinds of causes were infinite in  it would still be\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible to acquire knowledge; for it is only when we have become\n\t\t\t\t\tacquainted with the causes that we assume that we know a thing; and we\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot, in a finite time, go completely through what is additively\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite.The effect of a lecture depends upon\n\t\t\t\t\tthe habits of the listener; because we expect the language to which we\n\t\t\t\t\tare accustomed, and anything beyond this seems not to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe on the same level, but somewhat strange and unintelligible on\n\t\t\t\t\taccount of its unfamiliarity; for it is the familiar that is\n\t\t\t\t\tintelligible. The powerful effect of familiarity is clearly shown by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe laws, in which the fanciful and puerile survivals prevail, through\n\t\t\t\t\tforce of habit, against our recognition of them.Thus some people will not accept the\n\t\t\t\t\tstatements of a speaker unless he gives a mathematical proof; others\n\t\t\t\t\twill not unless he makes use of illustrations; others expect to have a\n\t\t\t\t\tpoet adduced as witness. Again, some require exactness in everything,\n\t\t\t\t\twhile others are annoyed by it, either because they cannot follow the\n\t\t\t\t\treasoning or because of its pettiness; for there is something about\n\t\t\t\t\texactness which seems to some people to be mean, no less in an\n\t\t\t\t\targument than in a business transaction.Hence one must\n\t\t\t\t\thave been already trained how to take each kind of argument, because\n\t\t\t\t\tit is absurd to seek simultaneously for knowledge and for the method\n\t\t\t\t\tof obtaining it; and neither is easy to acquire. Mathematical accuracy\n\t\t\t\t\tis not to be demanded in everything, but only in things which do not\n\t\t\t\t\tcontain matter.Hence this\n\t\t\t\t\tmethod is not that of natural science, because presumably all nature\n\t\t\t\t\tis concerned with matter. Hence we should first inquire what nature\n\t\t\t\t\tis; for in this way it will become clear what the objects of natural\n\t\t\t\t\tscience are [and whether it belongs to one science or more than one to\n\t\t\t\t\tstudy the causesand\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples of things]."}}, {"@n": "3", "@type": "Book", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "995a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "24", "@ed": "Bekker", "@unit":

These consist of all the\n\t\t\t\t\tdivergent views which are held about the first principles; and also of\n\t\t\t\t\tany other view apart from these which happens to have been\n\t\t\t\t\toverlooked.Now for\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who wish to get rid of perplexities it is a good plan to go into\n\t\t\t\t\tthem thoroughly; for the subsequent certainty is a release from the\n\t\t\t\t\tprevious perplexities, and release is impossible when we do not know\n\t\t\t\t\tthe knot. The perplexity of the mind shows that there is a \"knot\" in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subject; for in its perplexity it is in much the same condition as\n\t\t\t\t\tmen who are fettered: in both cases it is impossible to make any\n\t\t\t\t\tprogress.Hence we\n\t\t\t\t\tshould first have studied all the difficulties, both for the reasons\n\t\t\t\t\tgiven and also because those who start an inquiry without first\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidering the difficulties are like people who do not know where\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are going; besides, one does not even know whether the thing\n\t\t\t\t\trequired has been found or not. To such a man the\n\t\t\t\t\t is not clear; but it is clear to one who has\n\t\t\t\t\talready faced the difficulties.Further, one who has heard all the conflicting\n\t\t\t\t\ttheories, like one who has heard both sides in a lawsuit, is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily more competent to judge.The first\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty is concerned with the subjects which we discussed in our prefatory remarks. (1.) Does the\n\t\t\t\t\tstudy of the causes belong to one science or to more than one?(2.)\n\t\t\t\t\tHas that science only to contemplate the first principles of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, or is it also concerned with the principles which all use\n\t\t\t\t\tfor demonstratione.g. whether it is possible at the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime to assert and deny one and the same thing, and other similar\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples?And if it is concerned with substance, (3.) is there one science\n\t\t\t\t\twhich deals with all substances, or more than one; and if more than\n\t\t\t\t\tone, are they all cognate, or should we call some of them \"kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\tWisdom\" and others something different?This too is a question which demands inquiry: (iv.) should we hold\n\t\t\t\t\tthat only sensible substances exist, or that there are other besides?\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd should we hold that there is only one class of non-sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances, or more than one (as do those who posit the Forms and the\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical objects as intermediate between the Forms and sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings)?These\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions, then, as I say, must be considered; and also (v.) whether\n\t\t\t\t\tour study is concerned only with substances,or also with the essential attributes\n\t\t\t\t\tof substance;and further,\n\t\t\t\t\twith regard to Same and Other, and Like and Unlike and Contrariety,\n\t\t\t\t\tand Prior and Posterior, and all other such terms which dialecticians\n\t\t\t\t\ttry to investigate, basing their inquiry merely upon popular opinions;\n\t\t\t\t\twe must consider whose province it is to study all of these.Further, we must consider all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe essential attributes of these same things, and not merely what\n\t\t\t\t\teach one of them is, but also whether each one has one opposite; and (vi.) whether the first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples and elements of things are the genera under which they fall\n\t\t\t\t\tor the pre-existent parts into which each thing is divided; and if the\n\t\t\t\t\tgenera, whether they are those which are predicated ultimately of\n\t\t\t\t\tindividuals, or the primary generae.g., whether \"animal\" or\n\t\t\t\t\t\"man\" is the first principle and the more independent of the\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual.Above all we must\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider and apply ourselves to the question (7.) whether there is any\n\t\t\t\t\tother cause  besides matter, and if so whether it\n\t\t\t\t\tis dissociable from matter, and whether it is numerically one or\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral; and whether there is anything apart from the concrete thing\n\t\t\t\t\t(by the concrete thing I mean matter together with whatever is\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicated of it) or nothing; or whether there is in some cases but\n\t\t\t\t\tnot in others; and what these cases are.\n\t\t\t\t\tFurther, (8.) we must ask whether the first principles are limited\n\t\t\t\t\tin number or in kindboth those in the definitions and those\n\t\t\t\t\tin the substrateand (ix.) whether the principles of\n\t\t\t\t\tperishable and of imperishable things are the same or different; and\n\t\t\t\t\twhether all are imperishable, or those of perishable things are\n\t\t\t\t\tperishable.Further, there is the hardest and most\n\t\t\t\t\tperplexing question of all: (x.) whether Unity and Being (as the\n\t\t\t\t\tPythagoreans and Plato maintained) are not distinct, but are the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance of things; or whether this is not so, and the substrate is\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething distinct(as Empedocles holds of Love, another thinker of fire, and another of water or air);and (xi.) whether the first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples are universal or like individual things; and (12.) whether they exist potentially or\n\t\t\t\t\tactually; and further whether their potentiality or actuality depends\n\t\t\t\t\tupon anything other than motion; for these\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions may involve considerable difficulty.Moreover we must ask (13.) whether\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers and lines and figures and points are substances in any sense,\n\t\t\t\t\tor not; and if they are, whether they are separate from sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings or inherent in them. With\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to these problems not only is it difficult to attain to the\n\t\t\t\t\ttruth, but it is not even easy to state all the difficulties\n\t\t\t\t\tadequately.(1.)\n\t\t\t\t\tFirstly, then, with respect to the first point raised: whether it is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe province of one science or of more than one to study all the kinds\n\t\t\t\t\tof causes.How can\n\t\t\t\t\t science comprehend the first principles unless they\n\t\t\t\t\tare contraries? Again, in many things they are not all\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent.How can a\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple of motion be in immovable things? or the \"nature of the\n\t\t\t\t\tGood\"? for everything which is good in itself and of its own nature is\n\t\t\t\t\tan  and thus a cause, because for its sake other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings come to be and exist; and the  and\n\t\t\t\t\t is the end of some action, and all actions\n\t\t\t\t\tinvolve motion; thus it would be impossible either for this principle\n\t\t\t\t\tto exist in motionless things or for there to be any\n\t\t\t\t\t Good.Hence in mathematics too nothing is proved by means of this cause,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor is there any demonstration of the kind \"because it is better or\n\t\t\t\t\tworse\"; indeed no one takes any such consideration into\n\t\t\t\t\taccount.And so for\n\t\t\t\t\tthis reason some of the sophists, e.g. Aristippus, spurned mathematics, on the\n\t\t\t\t\tground that in the other arts, even the mechanical ones such as\n\t\t\t\t\tcarpentry and cobbling, all explanation is of the kind \"because it is\n\t\t\t\t\tbetter or worse,\" while mathematics takes no account of good and\n\t\t\t\t\tbad.\n\t\t\t\t\tOn the other hand if there are several\n\t\t\t\t\tsciences of the causes, and a different one for each different\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple, which of them shall we consider to be the one which we are\n\t\t\t\t\tseeking, or whom of the masters of these sciences shall we consider to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe most learned in the subject which we are investigating?For it is possible for all the\n\t\t\t\t\tkinds of cause to apply to the same object; e.g. in the case of a\n\t\t\t\t\thouse the source of motion is the art and the architect; the final\n\t\t\t\t\tcause is the function; the matter is earth and stones, and the form is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe definition. Now to judge from our discussion some time ago as to which of the sciences should\n\t\t\t\t\tbe called Wisdom, there is some case for applying the name to each of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem.Inasmuch as\n\t\t\t\t\tWisdom is the most sovereign and authoritative kind of knowledge,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the other sciences, like slaves, may not contradict, the\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge of the  and of the \n\t\t\t\t\tresembles Wisdom (since everything else is for the sake of the\n\t\t\t\t\t ); but inasmuch as it has been defined as\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge of the first principles and of the most knowable, the\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge of the essence will resemble Wisdom.For while there are many ways of\n\t\t\t\t\tunderstanding the same thing, we say that the man who recognizes a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing by its being something knows more than he who recognizes it by\n\t\t\t\t\tits not being something; and even in the former case one knows more\n\t\t\t\t\tthan another, and most of all he who knows  it is,\n\t\t\t\t\tand not he who knows its size or quality or natural capacity for\n\t\t\t\t\tacting or being acted upon.Further, in all other cases too, even in such as admit of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstration,we\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider that we know a particular thing when we know\n\t\t\t\t\t it is (e.g. what is the squaring of a rectangle?\n\t\t\t\t\tanswer, the finding of a mean proportional to its sides; and similarly\n\t\t\t\t\tin other instances); but in the case of generations and actions and\n\t\t\t\t\tall kinds of change, when we know the source of motion.This is distinct from and\n\t\t\t\t\topposite to the  . Hence it might be supposed that the\n\t\t\t\t\tstudy of each of these causes pertained to a different science.(2.) Again, with respect to the demonstrative\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples as well, it may be disputed whether they too are the\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects of one science or of\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral.By demonstrative I mean the axioms from\n\t\t\t\t\twhich all demonstration proceeds, e.g. \"everything must be either\n\t\t\t\t\taffirmed or denied,\" and \"it is impossible at once to be and not to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe,\" and all other such premisses. Is there one science both of these\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples and of substance, or two distinct sciences? and if there is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot one, which of the two should we consider to be the one which we\n\t\t\t\t\tare now seeking?It is not probable that both subjects\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to one science; for why should the claim to understand these\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples be peculiar to geometry rather than to any other science?\n\t\t\t\t\tThen if it pertains equally to any science, and yet cannot pertain to\n\t\t\t\t\tall, comprehension of these principles is no more\n\t\t\t\t\tpeculiar to the science which investigates substances than to any\n\t\t\t\t\tother science.Besides, in\n\t\t\t\t\twhat sense can there in be a science of these principles? We know\n\t\t\t\t\talready just what each of them is; at any rate other sciences employ\n\t\t\t\t\tthem as being known to us. If,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever there is a demonstrative science of them, there will have to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe some underlying genus, and some of the principles will be derived\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom axioms, and others will be unproved(for there cannot be demonstration of\n\t\t\t\t\teverything), since demonstration must proceed from something, and have\n\t\t\t\t\tsome subject matter, and prove something. Thus it follows that there\n\t\t\t\t\tis some one genus of demonstrable things; for all the demonstrative\n\t\t\t\t\tsciences employ axioms.On the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand, if the science of substance is distinct from the science of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese principles, which is of its own nature the more authoritative\n\t\t\t\t\tand ultimate?The axioms\n\t\t\t\t\tare most universal, and are the first principles of everything. And\n\t\t\t\t\twhose province will it be, if not the philosopher's, to study truth\n\t\t\t\t\tand error with respect to them?(3.) And\n\t\t\t\t\tin general, is there one science of all substances, or more than\n\t\t\t\t\tone? if there is not one,\n\t\t\t\t\twith what sort of substance must we assume that this science is\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned?On the\n\t\t\t\t\tother hand, it is not probable that there is one science of all\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances; for then there would be one demonstrative of all\n\t\t\t\t\tattributesassuming that every demonstrative\n\t\t\t\t\tscienceproceeds from\n\t\t\t\t\taccepted beliefs and studies the essential attributes concerned with\n\t\t\t\t\tsome definite subject matter.Thus to study the essential attributes\n\t\t\t\t\tconnected with the same genus is the province of the same science\n\t\t\t\t\tproceeding from the same beliefs. For the subject matter belongs to\n\t\t\t\t\tone science, and so do the axioms, whether to the same science or to a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent one; hence so do the attributes, whether they are studied by\n\t\t\t\t\tthese sciences themselves or by one derived from them.(v.) Further, is this study\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned only with substances, or with their attributes as well? I mean, e.g., if the solid is a\n\t\t\t\t\tkind of substance, and so too lines and planes, is it the province of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same science to investigate both these and their attributes, in\n\t\t\t\t\tevery class of objects about which mathematics demonstrates anything,\n\t\t\t\t\tor of a different science?If of the same, then the science of substance too would be in some\n\t\t\t\t\tsense demonstrative; but it does not seem that there is any\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstration of the \"what is it?\" And if of a different science, what\n\t\t\t\t\twill be the science which studies the attributes of substance? This is\n\t\t\t\t\ta very difficult question to answer.(iv.) Further, are we to say that only sensible substances exist, or\n\t\t\t\t\tthat others do as well? and is there really only one kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, or more than one (as they hold who\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak of the Forms and the Intermediates, which they maintain to be\n\t\t\t\t\tthe objects of the mathematical sciences)?In what sense we Platonists hold the Forms to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe both causes and independent substances has been stated in our original discussion on this subject.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut while they involve difficulty in many respects, not the least\n\t\t\t\t\tabsurdity is the doctrine that there are certain entities apart from\n\t\t\t\t\tthose in the sensible universe, and that these are the same as\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible things except in that the former are eternal and the latter\n\t\t\t\t\tperishable.For Platonists say nothing more or less than that there is an\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolute Man, and Horse, and Health; in which they closely resemble\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who state that there are Gods, but of human form; for as the\n\t\t\t\t\tlatter invented nothing more or less than eternal men, so the former\n\t\t\t\t\tsimply make the Forms eternal sensibles.Again, if anyone posits Intermediates distinct from Forms and\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible things, he will have many difficulties;because obviously not only will there\n\t\t\t\t\tbe lines apart from both Ideal and sensible lines, but it will be the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame with each of the other classes.\n\t\t\t\t\tThus since astronomy is one of the mathematical sciences, there will\n\t\t\t\t\thave to be a heaven besides the sensible heaven, and a sun and moon,\n\t\t\t\t\tand all the other heavenly bodies.But how are we to believe this? Nor is it\n\t\t\t\t\treasonable that the heaven should be immovable; but that it should\n\t\t\t\t\tmoveis utterly\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible. It is the same\n\t\t\t\t\twith the objects of optics and the mathematical theory of harmony;\n\t\t\t\t\tthese too, for the same reasons, cannot exist apart from sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects. Because if there are intermediate objects of sense and\n\t\t\t\t\tsensations, clearly there will also be animals intermediate between\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Ideal animals and the perishable animals.One might also\n\t\t\t\t\traise the question with respect to what kind of objects we are to look\n\t\t\t\t\tfor these sciences. For if we are to take it that the only difference\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween mensuration and geometry is that the one is concerned with\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which we can perceive and the other with things which we\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot, clearly there will be a science parallel to medicine (and to\n\t\t\t\t\teach of the other sciences), intermediate between Ideal medicine and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe medicine which we know.Yet how is this possible? for then there would be a class of healthy\n\t\t\t\t\tthings apart from those which are sensible and from the Ideally\n\t\t\t\t\thealthy. Nor, at the same time, is it true that mensuration is\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned with sensible and perishable magnitudes; for then it would\n\t\t\t\t\tperish as they do. Nor, again, can astronomy be concerned with\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible magnitudes or with this heaven of ours; for as sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tlines are not like those of which the geometrician speaks (since there\n\t\t\t\t\tis nothing sensible which is straight or curved in that sense; the\n\t\t\t\t\tcircle\n\t\t\t\t\ttouches the ruler not at a point, but <along a line> as\n\t\t\t\t\tProtagoras used to say in refuting the geometricians), so the paths\n\t\t\t\t\tand orbits of our heaven are not like those which astronomy discusses,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor have the symbols of the astronomer the same nature as the\n\t\t\t\t\tstars.Some, however, say that these so-called\n\t\t\t\t\tIntermediates between Forms and sensibles do exist: not indeed\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately from the sensibles, but in them. It would take too long to\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider in detail all the impossible consequences of this theory, but\n\t\t\t\t\tit will be sufficient to observe the following.On this view it is not logical that\n\t\t\t\t\tonly this should be so; in clearly it would be possible for the Forms\n\t\t\t\t\talso to be in sensible things; for the same argument applies to both.\n\t\t\t\t\tFurther, it follows necessarily that two solids must occupy the same\n\t\t\t\t\tspace; and that the Forms cannot be immovable, being present in\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible things, which move.And in general, what is the object of assuming\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Intermediates exist, but only in sensible things? The same\n\t\t\t\t\tabsurdities as before will result: there will be a heaven besides the\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible one, only not apart from it, but in the same place; which is\n\t\t\t\t\tstill more impossible.Thus it is very\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to say, not only what view we should adopt in the foregoing\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions in order to arrive at the truth, but also in the case of the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst principles (vi.) whether we should assume that the genera, or\n\t\t\t\t\tthe simplest constituents of each particular thing, are more truly the\n\t\t\t\t\telements and first principles of existing things. E.g., it is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally agreed that the elements and first principles of speech are\n\t\t\t\t\tthose things of which, in their simplest form, all speech is composed;\n\t\t\t\t\tand not the common term \"speech\"; and in the case of geometrical\n\t\t\t\t\tpropositions we call those the \"elements\" whose proofs are embodied in the proofs of all or\n\t\t\t\t\tmost of the rest.Again, in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case of bodies, both those who hold that there are several\n\t\t\t\t\telements and those who hold that there is one call the things of which\n\t\t\t\t\tbodies are composed and constituted first principles. E.g., Empedocles\n\t\t\t\t\tstates that fire and water and the other things associated with them\n\t\t\t\t\tare the elements which are present in things and of which things are\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed; he does not speak of them as genera of things.Moreover in the case of other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings too, if a man wishes to examine their nature he observes, e.g., of what parts a bed consists and\n\t\t\t\t\thow they are put together; and then he comprehends its nature. Thus to\n\t\t\t\t\tjudge from these arguments the first principles will not be the genera\n\t\t\t\t\tof things.But from the point of view\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is through definitions that we get to know each particular\n\t\t\t\t\tthing, and that the genera are the first principles of definitions,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe genera must also be the first principles of the things\n\t\t\t\t\tdefined.And if to\n\t\t\t\t\tgain scientific knowledge of things is to gain it of the species after\n\t\t\t\t\twhich things are named, the genera are first principles of the\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies. And apparently some even of those who call Unity\n\t\t\t\t\tor Being or the Great and Small elements of things treat them as\n\t\t\t\t\tgenera.Nor again is it possible\n\t\t\t\t\tto speak of the first principles in both senses.The formula of substance is one; but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe definition by genera will be different from that which tells us of\n\t\t\t\t\twhat  a thing is composed.Moreover, assuming that the genera are first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples in the truest sense, are we to consider the\n\t\t\t\t\t genera to be first principles, or the final terms\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicated of individuals? This question too involves some\n\t\t\t\t\tdispute.For if\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversals are always more truly first principles, clearly the answer\n\t\t\t\t\twill be \"the highest genera,\" since these are predicated of\n\t\t\t\t\teverything. Then there will be as many first principles of\n\t\t\t\t\tthingsas there are\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary genera, and so both Unity and Being will be first principles\n\t\t\t\t\tand substances, since they are in the highest degree predicated of all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings.But it is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible for either Unity or Being to be one genus of existing\n\t\t\t\t\tthings. For there must  differentiae of each genus, and\n\t\t\t\t\teach differentia must be ; but it is impossible either for the\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies of the genus to be predicated of the specific differentiae, or\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the genus to be predicated without its species. Hence if\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity or Being is a genus, there will be no differentia Being or\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity.But if they\n\t\t\t\t\tare not genera, neither will they be first principles, assuming that\n\t\t\t\t\tit is the genera that are first principles. And further, the\n\t\t\t\t\tintermediate terms, taken together with the differentiae, will be\n\t\t\t\t\tgenera, down to the individuals; but in point of fact, although some\n\t\t\t\t\tare thought to be such, others are not. Moreover the differentiae are\n\t\t\t\t\tmore truly principles than are the genera; and if they also are\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples, we get an almost infinite number of principles, especially\n\t\t\t\t\tif one makes the ultimate genus a principle. Moreover, if Unity is really more of the\n\t\t\t\t\tnature of a principle, and the indivisible is a unity, and every thing\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible is such either in quantity or in kind, and the indivisible\n\t\t\t\t\tin kind is prior to the divisible, and the genera are divisible into\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies, then it is rather the lowest predicate that will be a unity\n\t\t\t\t\t(for \"man\" is not the genus of individual men).Further, in the case of things which\n\t\t\t\t\tadmit of priority and posteriority, that which is predicated of the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings cannot exist apart from them. E.g., if 2 is the first number,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere will be no Number apart from the species of number; and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly there will be no Figure apart from the species of figures.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut if the genera do not exist apart from the species in these cases,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey will scarcely do so in others; because it is assumed that genera\n\t\t\t\t\tare most likely to exist in these cases.In individuals, however, there is no priority\n\t\t\t\t\tand posteriority. Further, where there is a question of better or\n\t\t\t\t\tworse, the better is always prior; so there will be no genus in these\n\t\t\t\t\tcases either.From these considerations\n\t\t\t\t\tit seems that it is the terms predicated of individuals, rather than\n\t\t\t\t\tthe genera, that are the first principles. But again on the other hand\n\t\t\t\t\tit is not easy to say in what sense we are to understand these to be\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples;for the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst principle and cause must be apart from the things of which it is\n\t\t\t\t\ta principle, and must be able to exist when separated from them. But\n\t\t\t\t\twhy should we assume that such a thing existsalongside of the individual, except in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is predicated universally and of all the terms? And indeed if\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is a sufficient reason, it is the more universal concepts that\n\t\t\t\t\tshould rather be considered to be principles; and so the primary\n\t\t\t\t\tgenera will be the principles.In this\n\t\t\t\t\tconnection there is a difficulty which is the hardest and yet the most\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary of all to investigate, and with which our inquiry is now\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned. (7.) If nothing exists apart from individual things, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthese are infinite in number, how is it possible to obtain knowledge\n\t\t\t\t\tof the numerically infinite? For we acquire our knowledge of all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings only in so far as they contain something universal, some one\n\t\t\t\t\tand identical characteristic.But if this is essential, and there must be\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething apart from individual things, it must be the genera; either\n\t\t\t\t\tthe lowest or the highest; but we have just concluded that this is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible.Further,\n\t\t\t\t\tassuming that when something is predicated of matter there is in the\n\t\t\t\t\tfullest sense something apart from the concrete whole, if there is\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething, must it exist apart from  concrete wholes,\n\t\t\t\t\tor apart from some but not others, or apart from none? If\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing exists apart from individual things, nothing will be\n\t\t\t\t\tintelligible; everything will be sensible, and there will be no\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge of anythingunless it be maintained that\n\t\t\t\t\tsense-perception is knowledge. Nor again will anything be eternal or\n\t\t\t\t\timmovable, since sensible things are all perishable and in\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion.Again, if\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing is eternal, even generation is impossible; for there must be\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething which becomes something, i.e. out of which something is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated, and of this series the ultimate term must be ungenerated;\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is if there is any end to the series and generation cannot take\n\t\t\t\t\tplace out of nothing.Further, if there is generation and motion, there must be limit too.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor (a) no motion is infinite, but every one has an end; (b) that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich cannot be completely generated cannot begin to be generated, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which has been generated must  as soon as it has\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen generated.Further, if\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter exists apart in virtue of being ungenerated, it is still more\n\t\t\t\t\tprobable that the substance, i.e. that which the matter is at any\n\t\t\t\t\tgiven time becoming, should exist. And if neither one nor the other\n\t\t\t\t\texists, nothing will exist at all. But if this is impossible, there\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be something, the shape or form, apart from the concrete\n\t\t\t\t\twhole.But again, if we assume this, there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty: in what cases shall we, and in what shall we not, assume\n\t\t\t\t\tit? Clearly it cannot be done in all cases; for we should not assume\n\t\t\t\t\tthat a particular house exists apart from particular houses.Moreover, are we to regard the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence of all things, e.g. of men, as one? This is absurd; for all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings whose essence is one are one.Then is it many and diverse? This too is\n\t\t\t\t\tillogical. And besides, how does the matter become each individual one\n\t\t\t\t\tof these things, and how is the concrete whole both matter and\n\t\t\t\t\tform?(8.) Further,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe following difficulty might be raised about the first principles.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf they are one in kind, none of them will be one in number, not even\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Idea of Unity or of Being. And how can there be knowledge unless\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is some universal term?On the other hand if they are numerically one,\n\t\t\t\t\tand each of the principles is one, and not, as in the case of sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, different in different instances (e.g. since a given syllable\n\t\t\t\t\tis always the same in kind, its first principles are always the same\n\t\t\t\t\tin kind, but only in kind, since they are essentially different in\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber)if the first principles are one, not in this sense,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut numerically, there will be nothing else apart from the elements;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor \"numerically one\" and \"individual\" are identical in meaning. This\n\t\t\t\t\tis what we mean by \"individual\": the numerically one; but by\n\t\t\t\t\t\"universal\" we mean what is predicable of individuals. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as, if the elements of language were limited in\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber, the whole of literature would be no more than those\n\t\t\t\t\telementsthat is, if there were not two nor more than two of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same <so it would be in the case of existing things and\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir principles>.(ix.) There is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty, as serious as any, which has been left out of account both\n\t\t\t\t\tby present thinkers and by their predecessors: whether the first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples of perishable and imperishable things are the same or\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent. For if they are the same, how is it that some things are\n\t\t\t\t\tperishable and others imperishable, and for what cause?The school of Hesiod, and all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cosmologists, considered only what was convincing to themselves,\n\t\t\t\t\tand gave no consideration to us. For they make the first principles\n\t\t\t\t\tGods or generated from Gods, and say that whatever did not taste of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe nectar and ambrosia became mortalclearly using these\n\t\t\t\t\tterms in a sense significant to themselves;but as regards the actual applications of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese causes their statements are beyond our comprehension. For if it\n\t\t\t\t\tis for pleasure that the Gods partake of them, the nectar and ambrosia\n\t\t\t\t\tare in no sense causes of their existence; but if it is to support\n\t\t\t\t\tlife, how can Gods who require nourishment be eternal?However, it is not worth while to consider seriously the subtleties\n\t\t\t\t\tof mythologists; we must ascertainby cross-examining those who offer demonstration of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir statements why exactly things which are derived from the same\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples are some of an eternal nature and some perishable. And\n\t\t\t\t\tsince these thinkers state no reason for this view, and it is\n\t\t\t\t\tunreasonable that things should be so, obviously the causes and\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples of things cannot be the same.Even the thinker who might be supposed to\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak most consistently, Empedocles, is in the same case; for he\n\t\t\t\t\tposits Strife as a kind of principle which is the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tdestruction, but none the less Strife would seem to produce everything\n\t\t\t\t\texcept the One; for everything except God proceeds from it.At any rate he saysFrom which grew all that was and is and shall\n\t\t\t\t\tbeIn time to come: the trees, and\n\t\t\t\t\tmen and women,The beasts and birds and\n\t\t\t\t\twater-nurtured fish,And the long-living\n\t\t\t\t\tGods.And it is obvious even apart\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom this; for if there had not been Strife in\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, all things would have been one, he says; for when they came\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether \"then Strife came to stand outermost.\" Hence it follows on his theory that God, the\n\t\t\t\t\tmost blessed being, is less wise than the others, since He does not\n\t\t\t\t\tknow all the elements; for He has no Strife in Him, and knowledge is\n\t\t\t\t\tof like by like:By earth (he says) we earth perceive,\n\t\t\t\t\tby water water,By air bright air, by\n\t\t\t\t\tfire consuming fire,Love too by love,\n\t\t\t\t\tand strife by grievous strife.Butand this is the point from which we\n\t\t\t\t\tstartedthus much is clear: that it follows on his theory\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Strife is no more the cause of destruction than it is of Being.\n\t\t\t\t\tNor, similarly, is Love the cause of Being; for in combining things\n\t\t\t\t\tinto one it destroys everything else.Moreover, of the actual process of change he gives no explanation,\n\t\t\t\t\texcept that it is so by nature:But when\n\t\t\t\t\tStrife waxing great among the membersSprang up to honor as the time came roundAppointed them in turn by a mighty\n\t\t\t\t\toath,as though change\n\t\t\t\t\twere a necessity; but he exhibits no cause for the\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity.However,\n\t\t\t\t\tthus much of his theory is consistent: he does not represent some\n\t\t\t\t\tthings to be perishable and others imperishable, but makes\n\t\t\t\t\teverythingperishable\n\t\t\t\t\texcept the elements. But the difficulty now being stated is why some\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are perishable and others not, assuming that they are derived\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the same principles.The foregoing\n\t\t\t\t\tremarks may suffice to show that the principles cannot be the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame.If however\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are different, one difficulty is whether they too are to be\n\t\t\t\t\tregarded as imperishable or as perishable. For if they are perishable,\n\t\t\t\t\tit is clearly necessary that they too must be derived from something\n\t\t\t\t\telse, since everything passes upon dissolution into that from which it\n\t\t\t\t\tis derived. Hence it follows that there are other principles prior to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first principles;but\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is impossible, whether the series stops or proceeds to infinity.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd further, how can perishable things exist if their principles are\n\t\t\t\t\tabolished? On the other hand if the principles are imperishable, why\n\t\t\t\t\tshould some imperishable principles produce perishable things, and\n\t\t\t\t\tothers imperishable things? This is not reasonable; either it is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible or it requires much explanation.Further, no one has so much as attempted to\n\t\t\t\t\tmaintain different principles; they maintain the same principles for\n\t\t\t\t\teverything. But they swallow down the difficulty\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we raised first as though\n\t\t\t\t\tthey took it to be trifling.But the hardest question of all to investigate and also the most\n\t\t\t\t\timportant with a view to the discovery of the truth, is whether after\n\t\t\t\t\tall Being and Unity are substances of existing things, and each of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem is nothing else than Being and Unity respectively, or whether we\n\t\t\t\t\tshould inquire what exactly Being and Unity are, there being some\n\t\t\t\t\tother nature underlying them.Some take the former, others the latter view\n\t\t\t\t\tof the nature of Being and Unity. Plato and the Pythagoreans hold that\n\t\t\t\t\tneither Being nor Unity is anything else than itself, and that this is\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir nature, their essence being simply Being and Unity.But the physicists, e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tEmpedocles, explain what Unity is by reducing it to something, as it\n\t\t\t\t\twere, more intelligibleor it would seem that by Love\n\t\t\t\t\tEmpedocles means Unity; at any rate Love is the cause of Unity in all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings. Others identify fire and others air with this Unity and Being\n\t\t\t\t\tof which things consist and from which they have been\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated.Those who\n\t\t\t\t\tposit more numerous elements also hold the same view; for they too\n\t\t\t\t\tmust identify Unity and Being with all the principles which they\n\t\t\t\t\trecognize.And it\n\t\t\t\t\tfollows that unless one assumes Unity and Being to be substance in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome sense, no other universal term can be substance; for Unity and\n\t\t\t\t\tBeing are the most universal of all terms,and if there is no absolute Unity or absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tBeing, no other concept can well exist apart from the so-called\n\t\t\t\t\tparticulars. Further, if Unity is not substance, clearly number cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tbe a separate characteristic of things; for number is units, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tunit is simply a particular kind of one.On the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand, if there is absolute Unity and Being, their substance must be\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity and Being; for no other term is predicated universally of Unity\n\t\t\t\t\tand Being, but only these terms themselves. Again, if there is to be\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolute Being and absolute Unity, it is very hard to see how there\n\t\t\t\t\tcan be anything else besides these; I mean, how things can be more\n\t\t\t\t\tthan one.For that which\n\t\t\t\t\tis other than what is, is not; and so by Parmenides' argument it must follow that all things are one, i.e.\n\t\t\t\t\tBeing. In either case there is a difficulty;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor whether Unity is not a substance or whether there is absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity, number cannot be a substance.It has already been stated why this is so if\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity is not a substance; and if it is, there is the same difficulty\n\t\t\t\t\tas about Being. For whence, if not from the absolute One or Unity, can\n\t\t\t\t\tthere be another one? It must be not-one; but all things are either\n\t\t\t\t\tone, or many of which each is one. Further, if absolute Unity is\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible, by Zeno's axiom\n\t\t\t\t\tit will be nothing.For\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which neither when added makes a thing greater nor when\n\t\t\t\t\tsubtracted makes it smaller is not an existent thing, he says; clearly assuming\n\t\t\t\t\tthat what exists is spatial magnitude. And if it is a spatial\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnitude it is corporeal, since the corporeal exists in all\n\t\t\t\t\tdimensions, whereas the other magnitudes, the plane or line, when\n\t\t\t\t\tadded to a thing in one way will increase it, but when added in\n\t\t\t\t\tanother will not; and the point or unit will not increase a thing in\n\t\t\t\t\tany way whatever.But\n\t\t\t\t\tsince Zeno's view is unsound, and it is possible for a thing to be\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible in such a way that it can be defended even against his\n\t\t\t\t\targument (for such a thing when added will\n\t\t\t\t\tincrease a thing in number though not in size)still how can\n\t\t\t\t\ta  be composed of one or more such indivisible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings? It is like saying that the line is composed of\n\t\t\t\t\tpoints.Moreover,\n\t\t\t\t\teven if one supposes the case to besuch that number is generated, as some say, from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe One itself and from something else which is not one, we must none\n\t\t\t\t\tthe less inquire why and how it is that the thing generated will be at\n\t\t\t\t\tone time number and at another magnitude, if the not-one was\n\t\t\t\t\tinequality and the same principle in both cases. For it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot clear how magnitude can be generated either from One and this\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple, or from a number and this principle.(13.) Out of this arises the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion whether numbers, bodies, planes and points are substances or\n\t\t\t\t\tnot. If not, the question of what Being is, what the substances of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are, baffles us; for modifications and motions and relations\n\t\t\t\t\tand dispositions and ratios do not seem to indicate the substance of\n\t\t\t\t\tanything; they are all predicated of a substrate, and none of them is\n\t\t\t\t\ta definite thing.As for\n\t\t\t\t\tthose things which might be especially supposed to indicate\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstancewater, earth, fire and air, of which composite\n\t\t\t\t\tbodies are composed their heat and cold\n\t\t\t\t\tand the like are modifications, not substances; and it is only the\n\t\t\t\t\tbody which undergoes these modifications that persists as something\n\t\t\t\t\treal and a kind of substance.Again, the body is less truly substance than\n\t\t\t\t\tthe plane, and the plane than the line, and the line than the unit or\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint; for it is by these that the body is defined, and it seems that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are possible without the body, but that the body cannot exist\n\t\t\t\t\twithout them.This is why\n\t\t\t\t\tthe vulgar and the earlier thinkers supposed that substance and Being\n\t\t\t\t\tare Body, and everything else the modifications of Body; and hence\n\t\t\t\t\talso that the first principles of bodies are the first principles of\n\t\t\t\t\texisting things; whereas later thinkers with a greater reputation for\n\t\t\t\t\twisdom supposed that substance and Being are numbers.As we\n\t\t\t\t\thave said, then, if these things are not substance, there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance or Being at all; for the attributes of these things surely\n\t\t\t\t\thave no right to be called existent things. On the other hand, if it\n\t\t\t\t\tbe agreed that lines and points are more truly substance than bodies\n\t\t\t\t\tare, yet unless we can see to what  of bodies they\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong (for they cannot be in sensible bodies) there will still be no\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance.Further,\n\t\t\t\t\tit is apparent that all these lines are divisions of Body, either in\n\t\t\t\t\tbreadthor in depth or\n\t\t\t\t\tin length. Moreover every kind of shape is equally present in a solid,\n\t\t\t\t\tso that if \"Hermes is not in the stone,\"\n\t\t\t\t\tneither is the half-cube in the cube as a determinate shape.Hence neither is the plane; for\n\t\t\t\t\tif any kind of plane were in it, so would that plane be which defines\n\t\t\t\t\tthe half-cube. The same argument applies to the line and to the point\n\t\t\t\t\tor unit. Hence however true it may be that body is substance, if\n\t\t\t\t\tplanes, lines and points are more truly substance than Body is, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthese are not substance in any sense, the question of what Being is\n\t\t\t\t\tand what is the substance of things baffles us.Because, in addition to the above\n\t\t\t\t\targuments, absurd results follow from a consideration of generation\n\t\t\t\t\tand destruction; for it seems that if substance, not having existed\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore, now exists, or having existed before, subsequently does not\n\t\t\t\t\texist it suffers these changes in the process of generation and\n\t\t\t\t\tdestruction. But points, lines and planes, although they exist at one\n\t\t\t\t\ttime and at another do not, cannot be in process of being either\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated or destroyed;for\n\t\t\t\t\twhenever bodies are joined or divided, at one\n\t\t\t\t\ttime, when they are joined one surface is instantaneously produced,\n\t\t\t\t\tand at another, when they are divided, two. Thus when the bodies are\n\t\t\t\t\tcombined the surface does not exist but has perished; and when they\n\t\t\t\t\tare divided, surfaces exist which did not exist before. (The\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible point is of course never divided into two.) And if they\n\t\t\t\t\t generated and destroyed, from what are they\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated?It is\n\t\t\t\t\tvery much the same with \"the present moment\" in time. This too cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tbe generated and destroyed; but nevertheless it seems always to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent, not being a substance. And obviously it is the same with\n\t\t\t\t\tpoints, lines and planes, for the argument is the same; they are all\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly either limits or divisions.In general one might wonder why\n\t\t\t\t\twe should seek for other entities apart from sensible things and the\n\t\t\t\t\tIntermediates: e.g., for the\n\t\t\t\t\tForms which we Platonists assume.If it is for the reason that the objects of\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematics, while differing from the things in our world in another\n\t\t\t\t\trespect, resemble them in being a plurality of objects similar in\n\t\t\t\t\tform, so that their principles cannot be numerically determined (just\n\t\t\t\t\tas the principles of all language in this world of ours are\n\t\t\t\t\tdeterminate not in number but in kindunless one takes such\n\t\t\t\t\tand such a particular syllableor sound, for the principles of these are\n\t\t\t\t\tdeterminate in number tooand similarly with the Intermediates, for in\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir case too there is an infinity of objects similar in form), then\n\t\t\t\t\tif there is not another set of objects apart from sensible and\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical objects, such as the Forms are said to be, there will be\n\t\t\t\t\tno substance which is one both in kind and in number, nor will the\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples of things be determinate in number, but in kind\n\t\t\t\t\tonly.Thus if this is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily so, it is necessary for this reason to posit the Forms\n\t\t\t\t\talso. For even if their exponents do not articulate their theory\n\t\t\t\t\tproperly, still this is what they are trying to express, and it must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe that they maintain the Forms on the ground that each of them is a\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, and none of them exists by accident.On the other hand, if we are to assume\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the Forms exist, and that the first principles are one in number\n\t\t\t\t\tbut not in kind, we have already stated the impossible consequences which must follow.(12.) Closely\n\t\t\t\t\tconnected with these questions is the problem whether the elements\n\t\t\t\t\texist potentially or in some other sense.If in some other sense, there will be\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else prior to the first principles. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthe potentiality is prior to the actual cause, and the potential need\n\t\t\t\t\tnot necessarily always become actual. On the other hand, if the\n\t\t\t\t\telements exist potentially, it is possible for nothing to exist; for\n\t\t\t\t\teven that which does not yet exist is capable of existing. That which\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not exist may come to be, but nothing which cannot exist comes to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe.(xi.) Besides the foregoing problems about the first principles we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust also raise the question whether they are universal or such as we\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribe the particulars to be. For if they are universal, there will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe no substances; for no common term denotes an individual thing, but\n\t\t\t\t\ta type; and substance is an individual thing.But if the common predicate be hypostatized as\n\t\t\t\t\tan individual thing, Socrates\n\t\t\t\t\twill be several beings: himself, and Man, and Animalthat\n\t\t\t\t\tis, if each predicate denotes one particular thing.These then are the consequences if the\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples are universal. If on the other hand they are not universal\n\t\t\t\t\tbut like particulars, they will not be knowable; for the knowledge of\n\t\t\t\t\teverything is universal. Hence there will have to be other universally\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicated principles prior to the first principles, if there is to be\n\t\t\t\t\tany knowledge of them."}}, {"@n": "4", "@type": "Book", "p":

This science is not the same as any of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe so-called particular sciences, for none of the others contemplates\n\t\t\t\t\tBeing generally  Being; they divide off some\n\t\t\t\t\tportion of it and study the attribute of this portion, as do for\n\t\t\t\t\texample the mathematical sciences.But since it is for the first principles and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe most ultimate causes that we are searching, clearly they must\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to something in virtue of its own nature. Hence if these\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples were investigated by those also who investigated the\n\t\t\t\t\telements of existing things, the elements must be elements of Being\n\t\t\t\t\tnot incidentally, but  Being. Therefore it\n\t\t\t\t\tis of Being  Being that we too must grasp\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first causes.The term \"being\" is used in various\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses, but with reference to one central idea and one definite\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristic, and not as merely a common epithet. Thus as the term\n\t\t\t\t\t\"healthy\" always relates to health (either as preserving it or as\n\t\t\t\t\tproducing it or as indicating it or as receptive of it), and as\n\t\t\t\t\t\"medical\" relates to the art of medicine (either as possessing it or\n\t\t\t\t\tas naturally adapted for it or as being a function of\n\t\t\t\t\tmedicine)and we shall find other terms used similarly to\n\t\t\t\t\ttheseso\n\t\t\t\t\t\"being \" is used in various senses, but always with reference to one\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple. For some things are said to \"be\" because they are\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances; others because they are modifications of substance; others\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they are a process towards substance, or destructions or\n\t\t\t\t\tprivations or qualities of substance, or productive or generative of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance or of terms relating to substance, or negations of certain\n\t\t\t\t\tof these terms or of substance. (Hence we even say that not-being\n\t\t\t\t\t not-being.)And so, just as there is one science of all\n\t\t\t\t\thealthy things, so it is true of everything else. For it is not only\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of terms which express one common notion that the\n\t\t\t\t\tinvestigation belongs to one science, but also in the case of terms\n\t\t\t\t\twhich relate to one particular characteristic; for the latter too, in\n\t\t\t\t\ta sense, express one common notion. Clearly then the study of things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich  being, also belongs to one\n\t\t\t\t\tscience.Now in every\n\t\t\t\t\tcase knowledge is principally concerned with that which is primary,\n\t\t\t\t\ti.e. that upon which all other things depend, and from which they get\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir names. If, then, substance is this primary thing, it is of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances that the philosopher must grasp the first principles and\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses.Now of every single class\n\t\t\t\t\tof things, as there is one perception,so there is one science: e.g., grammar, which is\n\t\t\t\t\tone science, studies all articulate sounds.Hence the study of all the species of Being\n\t\t\t\t\t Being belongs to a science which is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerically one, and the study of the several species of Being belongs\n\t\t\t\t\tto the specific parts of that science.Now if Being and Unity are the same, i.e. a single nature, in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsense that they are associated as principle and cause are, and not as\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing denoted by the same definition (although it makes no difference\n\t\t\t\t\tbut rather helps our argument if we understand them in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tsense),since \"one\n\t\t\t\t\tman\" and \"man\" and \"existent man\" and \"man\" are the same thing, i.e.\n\t\t\t\t\tthe duplication in the statement \"he is a man and an\n\t\t\t\t\t man\" gives no fresh meaning (clearly the\n\t\t\t\t\tconcepts of humanity and existence are not dissociated in respect of\n\t\t\t\t\teither coming to be or ceasing to be), and similarly in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe term \"one,\" so that obviously the additional term in these phrases\n\t\t\t\t\thas the same significance, and Unity is nothing distinct from\n\t\t\t\t\tBeing;and further if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe substance of each thing is one in no accidental sense, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly is of its very nature something which isthen\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are just as many species of Being as of Unity. And to study the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence of these species (I mean, e.g., the study of Same and Other\n\t\t\t\t\tand all the other similar conceptsroughly speaking all the \"contraries\" are\n\t\t\t\t\treducible to this first principle; but we may consider\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they have been sufficiently studied in the \"Selection of\n\t\t\t\t\tContraries\") is the province of a science which is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerically one.And there are just as\n\t\t\t\t\tmany divisions of philosophy as there are kinds of substance; so that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere must be among them a First Philosophy and one which follows upon\n\t\t\t\t\tit.For Being and\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity at once entail genera, and so the sciences will correspond to\n\t\t\t\t\tthese genera. The term \"philosopher\" is like the term \"mathematician\"\n\t\t\t\t\tin its uses; for mathematics too has divisionsthere is a\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary and a secondary science, and others successively, in the realm\n\t\t\t\t\tof mathematics.Now since it is the province of one\n\t\t\t\t\tscience to study opposites, and the opposite of unity is plurality,\n\t\t\t\t\tand it is the province of one science to study the negation and\n\t\t\t\t\tprivation of Unity, because in both cases we are studying Unity, to\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the negation (or privation) refers, stated either in the simple\n\t\t\t\t\tform that Unity is not present, or in the form that it is not present\n\t\t\t\t\tin a particular class; in the latter case Unity is modified by the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentia, apart from the content of the negation (for the negation\n\t\t\t\t\tof Unity is its absence); but in privation there is a substrate of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the privation is predicated.The opposite of Unity, then, is\n\t\t\t\t\tPlurality; and so the opposites of the above-mentioned\n\t\t\t\t\tconceptsOtherness, Dissimilarity, Inequality and everything\n\t\t\t\t\telse which is derived from these or from Plurality or\n\t\t\t\t\tUnityfall\n\t\t\t\t\tunder the cognizance of the aforesaid science. And one of them is\n\t\t\t\t\tOppositeness; for this is a form of Difference, and Difference is a\n\t\t\t\t\tform of Otherness.Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tsince the term \"one\" is used in various senses, so too will these\n\t\t\t\t\tterms be used; yet it pertains to one science to take cognizance of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem all. For terms fall under different sciences, not if they are\n\t\t\t\t\tused in various senses, but if their definitions are neither identical\n\t\t\t\t\tnor referable to a common notion.And since everything is referred to that which\n\t\t\t\t\tis primary, e.g. all things which are called \"one\" are referred to the\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary \"One,\" we must admit that this is also true of Identity and\n\t\t\t\t\tOtherness and the Contraries. Thus we must first distinguish all the\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses in which each term is used, and then attribute them to the\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary in the case of each predicate, and see how they are related to\n\t\t\t\t\tit; for some will derive their name from possessing and others from\n\t\t\t\t\tproducing it, and others for similar reasons.Thus\n\t\t\t\t\tclearly it pertains to one science to give an account both of these\n\t\t\t\t\tconcepts and of substance (this was one of the questions raised in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe \"Difficulties\"), and it is the function of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe philosopher to be able to study all subjects. If this is not\n\t\t\t\t\tso, who is it who in will investigate whether \"\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates\" and \"\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates seated\" are the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthing; or whether one thing has one contrary, or what the contrary is,\n\t\t\t\t\tor how many meanings it has? and similarly with all other such\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions.Thus\n\t\t\t\t\tsince these are the essential modifications of Unity  Unity and of Being  Being,\n\t\t\t\t\tand not  numbers or lines or fire, clearly\n\t\t\t\t\tit a pertains to that science to discover both the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence and the attributes of these concepts.And those who investigate them err, not\n\t\t\t\t\tin being unphilosophical, but because the substance, of which they\n\t\t\t\t\thave no real knowledge, is prior. For just as number  number has its peculiar modifications, e.g. oddness\n\t\t\t\t\tand evenness, commensurability and equality, excess and defect, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthese things are inherent in numbers both considered independently and\n\t\t\t\t\tin relation to other numbers; and as similarly other peculiar\n\t\t\t\t\tmodifications are inherent in the solid and the immovable and the\n\t\t\t\t\tmoving and the weightless and that which has weight; so Being  Being has certain peculiar modifications,\n\t\t\t\t\tand it is about these that it is the philosopher's function to\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscover the truth. And here is evidence of this fact.Dialecticians and sophists\n\t\t\t\t\twear the same appearance as the philosopher, for sophistry is Wisdom\n\t\t\t\t\tin appearance only, and dialecticians discuss all subjects,and Being is a subject common to\n\t\t\t\t\tthem all; but clearly they discuss these concepts because they\n\t\t\t\t\tappertain to philosophy.For sophistry and dialectic are concerned with the same class of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects as philosophy, but philosophy differs from the former in the\n\t\t\t\t\tnature of its capability and from the latter in its outlook on life.\n\t\t\t\t\tDialectic treats as an exercise what philosophy tries to understand,\n\t\t\t\t\tand sophistry seems to be philosophy; but is not.Further, the second column of contraries is privative, and\n\t\t\t\t\teverything is reducible to Being and Not being, and Unity and\n\t\t\t\t\tPlurality; e.g. Rest falls under Unity and Motion under Plurality. And\n\t\t\t\t\tnearly everyone agrees that substance and existing things are composed\n\t\t\t\t\tof contraries; at any rate all speak of the first principles as\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrariessome as Odd and Even, some as Hot and Cold, some\n\t\t\t\t\tas Limit and Unlimited, some as Love and Strife. And it is\n\t\t\t\t\tapparent that all other things also are reducible to Unity and\n\t\t\t\t\tPlurality (we may assume this reduction); and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe principles adduced by other thinkers fall entirely under these as\n\t\t\t\t\tgenera.It is clear,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, from these considerations also, that it pertains to a single\n\t\t\t\t\tscience to study Being  Being; for all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are either contraries or derived from contraries, and the first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples of the contraries are Unity and Plurality. And these belong\n\t\t\t\t\tto one science, whether they have reference to one common notion or\n\t\t\t\t\tnot. Probably the truth is that they have not; but nevertheless even\n\t\t\t\t\tif the term \"one\" is used in various senses, the others will be\n\t\t\t\t\trelated to the primary sense (and similarly with the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries)even if Being or Unity is not a universal and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same in all cases, or is not separable from particulars (as it\n\t\t\t\t\tpresumably is not; the unity is in some cases one of reference and in\n\t\t\t\t\tothers one of succession). For this very reason it is not the function\n\t\t\t\t\tof the geometrician to inquire what is Contrariety or Completeness or\n\t\t\t\t\tBeing or Unity or Identity or Otherness, but to proceed from the\n\t\t\t\t\tassumption of them.Clearly, then, it pertains to one\n\t\t\t\t\tscience to study Being  Being, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes inherent in it  Being; and the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame science investigates, besides the concepts mentioned above,\n\t\t\t\t\tPriority and Posteriority, Genus and Species, Whole and Part, and all\n\t\t\t\t\tother such concepts.We must pronounce whether it pertains\n\t\t\t\t\tto the same scienceto study\n\t\t\t\t\tboth the so-called axioms in mathematics and substance, or to\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent sciences. It is obvious that the investigation of these\n\t\t\t\t\taxioms too pertains to one science, namely the science of the\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosopher; for they apply to all existing things, and not to a\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular class separate and distinct from the rest. Moreover all\n\t\t\t\t\tthinkers employ thembecause they are axioms of Being  Being, and every genus possesses\n\t\t\t\t\tBeingbut\n\t\t\t\t\temploy them only in so far as their purposes require; i.e., so far as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe genus extends about which they are carrying out their proofs.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence since these axioms apply to all things  Being (for this is what is common to them), it is the\n\t\t\t\t\tfunction of him who studies Being  Being to\n\t\t\t\t\tinvestigate them as well.For this reason no one who is pursuing a particular\n\t\t\t\t\tinquiryneither a geometrician nor an\n\t\t\t\t\tarithmeticianattempts to state whether they are true or\n\t\t\t\t\tfalse; but some of the physicists did so, quite naturally; for they\n\t\t\t\t\talone professed to investigate nature as a whole, and Being.But inasmuch as there is a more\n\t\t\t\t\tultimate type of thinker than the natural philosopher (for nature is\n\t\t\t\t\tonly a genus of Being), the investigation of these axioms too will\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to the universal thinker who studies the primary reality.\n\t\t\t\t\tNatural philosophy is a kind of Wisdom,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut not the primary kind.As for the attempts of some of those who discuss how the truth\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be received, they are due to lack of training in logic; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthey should understand these things before they approach their task,\n\t\t\t\t\tand not investigate while they are still learning.Clearly then it is the function of the\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosopher, i.e. the student of the whole of reality in its essential\n\t\t\t\t\tnature, to investigate also the principles of syllogistic reasoning.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd it is proper for him who best understands each class of subject to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe able to state the most certain principles of that subject; so that\n\t\t\t\t\the who understands the modes of Being  Being\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be able to state the most certain principles of all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings.Now this\n\t\t\t\t\tperson is the philosopher, and the most certain principle of all is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat about which one cannot be mistaken; for such a principle must be\n\t\t\t\t\tboth the most familiar (for it is about the unfamiliar that errors are\n\t\t\t\t\talways made), and not based on hypothesis.For the principle which the student of any\n\t\t\t\t\tform of Being must grasp is no hypothesis; and that which a man must\n\t\t\t\t\tknow if he knows anything he must bring with him to his\n\t\t\t\t\ttask.Clearly, then, it is a\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple of this kind that is the most certain of all principles. Let\n\t\t\t\t\tus next state  this principle is.\"It is impossible for the same\n\t\t\t\t\tattribute at once to belong and not to belongto the same thing and in the same\n\t\t\t\t\trelation\"; and we must add any further qualifications that may be\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary to meet logical objections. This is the most certain of all\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples, since it possesses the required definition;for it is impossible for\n\t\t\t\t\tanyone to suppose that the same thing is and is not, as some imagine\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Heraclitus saysfor what a man says does not\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily represent what he believes.And if it is impossible for contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes to belong at the same time to the same subject (the usual\n\t\t\t\t\tqualifications must be added to this premiss also), and an opinion\n\t\t\t\t\twhich contradicts another is contrary to it, then clearly it is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible for the same man to suppose at the same time that the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is and is not; for the man who made this error would entertain\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo contrary opinions at the same time.Hence all men who are demonstrating anything\n\t\t\t\t\trefer back to this as an ultimate belief; for it is by nature the\n\t\t\t\t\tstarting-point of all the other axioms as well.There\n\t\t\t\t\tare some, however, as we have said, who both state themselves that the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame thing can be and not be, and say that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible to hold this view. Many even of the physicists adopt this\n\t\t\t\t\ttheory. But we have just assumed that it is impossible at once to be\n\t\t\t\t\tand not to be, and by this means we have proved that this is the most\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain of all principles.Some, indeed, demand to have the law proved, but this is because\n\t\t\t\t\tthey lack education; for it shows lack of education not to know of\n\t\t\t\t\twhat we should require proof, and of what we should not. For it is\n\t\t\t\t\tquite impossible that everything should have a proof; the process\n\t\t\t\t\twould go on to infinity, so that even so there would be no proof. If on the other hand there are\n\t\t\t\t\tsome things of which no proof need be sought, they cannot say what\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple they think to be more self-evident. Even in the case of this\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw, however, we can demonstrate the impossibility by refutation, if\n\t\t\t\t\tonly our opponent makes some statement. If he makes none, it is absurd\n\t\t\t\t\tto seek for an argument against one who has no arguments of his own\n\t\t\t\t\tabout anything, in so far as he has none; for such a person, in so far\n\t\t\t\t\tas he is such, is really no better than a vegetable.And I say that proof by refutation\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffers from simple proof in that he who attempts to prove might seem\n\t\t\t\t\tto beg the fundamental question, whereas if the discussion is provoked\n\t\t\t\t\tthus by someone else, refutation and not proof will result.The starting-point for all such\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussions is not the claim that he should state that something is or\n\t\t\t\t\tis not so(because this\n\t\t\t\t\tmight be supposed to be a begging of the question), but that he should\n\t\t\t\t\tsay something significant both to himself and to another (this is\n\t\t\t\t\tessential if any argument is to follow; for otherwise such a person\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot reason either with himself or with another);and if this is granted, demonstration\n\t\t\t\t\twill be possible, for there will be something already defined. But the\n\t\t\t\t\tperson responsible is not he who demonstrates but he who acquiesces;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor though he disowns reason he acquiesces to reason. Moreover, he who\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes such an admission as this has admitted the truth of something\n\t\t\t\t\tapart from demonstration [so that not everything will be \"so and not\n\t\t\t\t\tso\"].Thus in the first place it is obvious that\n\t\t\t\t\tthis at any rate is true: that the term \"to be\" or \"not to be\" has a\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinite meaning; so that not everything can be \"so and not so.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tAgain, if \"man\" has one meaning, let this be \"two-footed\n\t\t\t\t\tanimal.\"By \"has one\n\t\t\t\t\tmeaning\" I mean this: if X means \"man,\" then if anything is a man, its\n\t\t\t\t\thumanity will consist in being X. And it makes no difference even if\n\t\t\t\t\tit be said that \"man\" has several meanings, provided that they are\n\t\t\t\t\tlimited in number; for one could assign a different\n\t\t\t\t\tname to each formula.For\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance, it might be said that \"man\" has not one meaning but several,\n\t\t\t\t\tone of which has the formula \"two-footed animal,\" and there might be\n\t\t\t\t\tmany other formulae as well, if they were limited in number; for a\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular name could be assigned to each for formula.If on the other hand it be\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid that \"man\" has an infinite number of meanings, obviously there\n\t\t\t\t\tcan be no discourse; for not to have one meaning is to have no\n\t\t\t\t\tmeaning, and if words have no meaning there is an end of discourse\n\t\t\t\t\twith others, and even, strictly speaking, with oneself; because it is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible to think of anything if we do not think of one thing; and\n\t\t\t\t\teven if this were possible, one name might be assigned to that of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we think.Now let\n\t\t\t\t\tthis name, as we said at the beginning, have a meaning; and let it\n\t\t\t\t\thave one meaning. Now it is impossible that \"being man\" should have\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same meaning as \"not being man,\" that is, if \"man\" is not merely\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicable of one subject but has one meaning(for we do not identify \"having one\n\t\t\t\t\tmeaning\" with \"being predicable of one subject,\" since in this case\n\t\t\t\t\t\"cultured\" and \"white\" and \"man\" would have one meaning, and so all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings would be one; for they would all have the same meaning). And it\n\t\t\t\t\twill be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be, except by\n\t\t\t\t\tequivocation, as e.g. one whom we call \"man\"others might call \"not-man\";but the problem is whether the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame thing can at once be and not be \"man,\" not in  ,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut in  . If \"man\" and \"not-man\" have not different\n\t\t\t\t\tmeanings, clearly \"not being a man\" will mean nothing different from\n\t\t\t\t\t\"being a man\"; and so \"being a man\" will be \"not being a man\"; they\n\t\t\t\t\twill be one.For \"to be\n\t\t\t\t\tone\" means, as in the case of \"garment\" and \"coat,\" that the formula\n\t\t\t\t\tis one. And if \"being man\" and \"being not-man\" are to be one, they\n\t\t\t\t\twill have the same meaning; but it has been proved above that they\n\t\t\t\t\thave different meanings. If then anything can be truly said to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\"man,\" it must be \"two-footed animal\"; for this is what \"man\" was\n\t\t\t\t\tintended to mean.And if\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is necessarily so, it is impossible that at the same time the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame thing should not be \"two-footed animal.\" For \"to be necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\tso\" means this: that it is impossible not to be so. Thus it cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue to say at the same time that the same thing is and is not\n\t\t\t\t\tman.And the same\n\t\t\t\t\targument holds also in the case of not being man; because \"being man\" and \"being not-man\" have different meanings if\n\t\t\t\t\t\"being white\" and \"being man\" have different meanings (for the\n\t\t\t\t\topposition is much stronger in the former case so as to produce\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent meanings).And\n\t\t\t\t\tif we are told that \"white\" too means one and the same thing,\n\t\t\t\t\twe shall say again just what we said before, that in that case all things, and not merely\n\t\t\t\t\tthe opposites, will be one. But if this is impossible, what we have\n\t\t\t\t\tstated follows; that is, if our opponent answers our question; but if\n\t\t\t\t\twhen asked the simple question he includes in his answer the\n\t\t\t\t\tnegations, he is not answering our question.There is nothing to prevent the same thing\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom being \"man\" and \"white\" and a multitude of other things; but\n\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless when asked whether it is true to say that X is man, or\n\t\t\t\t\tnot, one should return an answer that means one thing, and not add\n\t\t\t\t\tthat X is white and large. It is indeed impossible to enumerate all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe infinity of accidents; and so let him enumerate either all or\n\t\t\t\t\tnone.Similarly\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, even if the same thing is ten thousand times \"man\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"not-man,\" one should not include in one's answer to the question\n\t\t\t\t\twhether it is \"man\" that it is at the same time also \"not-man,\" unless\n\t\t\t\t\tone is also bound to include in one's answer all the other accidental\n\t\t\t\t\tthings that the subject is or is not.And if one does this, he is not arguing\n\t\t\t\t\tproperly.In general those who\n\t\t\t\t\ttalk like this do away with substance and essence,for they are compelled to assert that\n\t\t\t\t\tall things are accidents, and that there is no such thing as \"being\n\t\t\t\t\tessentially man\" or \"animal.\" For if there is to be such a thing as\n\t\t\t\t\t\"being essentially man,\" this will not be \"being not-man\" nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\"not-being man\" (and yet these are negations of it); for it was\n\t\t\t\t\tintended to have one meaning, i.e. the substance of\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething.But to\n\t\t\t\t\tdenote a substance means that the essence is that and nothing else;\n\t\t\t\t\tand if for it \"being essentially man\" is the same as either \"being\n\t\t\t\t\tessentially not-man\" or \"essentially not-being man,\" the essence will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe something else.Thus\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are compelled to say that nothing can have such a definition as\n\t\t\t\t\tthis, but that all things are accidental; for this is the distinction\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween substance and accident: \"white\" is an accident of \"man,\"\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause although he is white, he is not white in essence.And since the accidental\n\t\t\t\t\talways implies a predication about some subject, if all statements are\n\t\t\t\t\taccidental, there will be nothing primary about which they are made;\n\t\t\t\t\tso the predication must proceed to\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinity. But this is impossible, for not even more than two accidents\n\t\t\t\t\tcan be combined in predication. An accident cannot be an accident of\n\t\t\t\t\tan accident unless both are accidents of the same thing.I mean, e.g., that \"white\" is\n\t\t\t\t\t\"cultured\" and \"cultured\" \"white\" merely because both are accidents of\n\t\t\t\t\ta man. But it is not in this sensethat both terms are\n\t\t\t\t\taccidents of something elsethat\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates is cultured. Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tsince some accidents are predicated in the latter and some in the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer sense, such as are predicated in the way that \"white\" is of\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates cannot be an\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite series in the upper direction; e.g. there cannot be another\n\t\t\t\t\taccident of \"white Socrates,\"\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the sum of these predications does not make a single\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement.Nor can\n\t\t\t\t\t\"white \" have a further accident, such as \"cultured\"; for the former\n\t\t\t\t\tis no more an accident of the latter than vice versa; and besides we\n\t\t\t\t\thave distinguished that although some predicates are accidental in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis sense, others are accidental in the sense that \"cultured\" is to\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates; and whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tin the former case the accident is an accident of an accident, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot so in the latter; and thus not all predications will be of\n\t\t\t\t\taccidents.Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\teven so there will be something which denotes substance. And if this\n\t\t\t\t\tis so, we have proved that contradictory statements cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicated at the same time.Again, if\n\t\t\t\t\tall contradictory predications of the same subject at the same time\n\t\t\t\t\tare true, clearly all things will be one.For if\n\t\t\t\t\tit is equally possible either to affirm or deny anything of anything,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same thing will be a trireme and a wall and a man; which is what\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily follows for those who hold the theory of Protagoras. For if anyone thinks that a man is not\n\t\t\t\t\ta trireme, he is clearly not a trireme; and so he also is a trireme if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe contradictory statement is true.And the result is the dictum of Anaxagoras,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"all things mixed together\"; so that nothing truly exists. It seems, then, that they are\n\t\t\t\t\tspeaking of the Indeterminate; and while they think that they are\n\t\t\t\t\tspeaking of what exists, they are really speaking of what does not;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the Indeterminate is that which exists potentially but not\n\t\t\t\t\tactually.But indeed\n\t\t\t\t\tthey must admit the affirmation or negation of any predicate of any\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject, for it is absurd that in the case of each term its own\n\t\t\t\t\tnegation should be true, and the negation of some other term which is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot true of it should not be true. I mean, e.g., that if it is true to\n\t\t\t\t\tsay that a man is not a man, it is obviously also true to say that he\n\t\t\t\t\tis or is not a trireme.Then if the affirmation is true, so must the negation be true; but\n\t\t\t\t\tif the affirmation is not true the negation will be even truer than\n\t\t\t\t\tthe negation of the original term itself. Therefore if the latter negation is true, the negation of \"trireme\"\n\t\t\t\t\twill also be true; and if this is true, the affirmation will be true\n\t\t\t\t\ttoo.And not only does this follow\n\t\t\t\t\tfor those who hold this theory, but also that it is not necessary\n\t\t\t\t\teither to affirm or to deny a statement.For if it is true that X is both man and\n\t\t\t\t\tnot-man, clearly he will be neither man nor not-man; for to the two\n\t\t\t\t\tstatements there correspond two negations, and if the former is taken\n\t\t\t\t\tas a single statement compounded out of two, the latter is also a\n\t\t\t\t\tsingle statement and opposite to it.Again, either\n\t\t\t\t\tthis applies to all terms, and the same thing is both white and\n\t\t\t\t\tnot-white, and existent and non-existent, and similarly with all other\n\t\t\t\t\tassertions and negations; or it does not apply to all, but only to\n\t\t\t\t\tsome and not to others.And if it does not apply to all, the exceptions will be\n\t\t\t\t\tadmitted; but if it does apply to\n\t\t\t\t\tall, again either (a) the negation will be true wherever the\n\t\t\t\t\taffirmation is true, and the affirmation will be true wherever the\n\t\t\t\t\tnegation is true, or (d) the negation will be true wherever the\n\t\t\t\t\tassertion is true, but the assertion will not always be true where the\n\t\t\t\t\tnegation is true. And in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe latter case there will be something which definitely is not, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthis will be a certain belief; and if that it is not is certain and\n\t\t\t\t\tknowable, the opposite assertion will be still more knowable. But if\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is denied can be equally truly asserted, it must be either true\n\t\t\t\t\tor false to state the predicates separately and say, e.g.,that a thing is white, and again\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is not-white.And\n\t\t\t\t\tif it is not-true to state them separately, our opponent does not say\n\t\t\t\t\twhat he professes to say, and nothing exists; and how can that which\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not exist speak or walk? And again all things will be one, as we\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid before,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the same thing will be \"man\" and \"God\" and \"trireme\" and the\n\t\t\t\t\tnegations of these terms.For if it is equally possible to assert or deny anything of\n\t\t\t\t\tanything, one thing will not differ from another; for if anything does\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffer, it will be true and unique. And similarly even if it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible to make a true statement while separating the predicates,\n\t\t\t\t\twhat we have stated follows. Moreover it follows that all statements\n\t\t\t\t\twould be true and all false; and that our opponent himself admits that\n\t\t\t\t\twhat he says is false. Besides, it is obvious that discussion with him\n\t\t\t\t\tis pointless, because he makes no real statement.For he says neither \"yes\" nor \"no,\" but\n\t\t\t\t\t\"yes and no\"; and again he denies both of these and says \"neither yes\n\t\t\t\t\tnor no\"; otherwise there would be already some definite\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement.Again, if when the\n\t\t\t\t\tassertion is true the negation is false, and when the latter is true\n\t\t\t\t\tthe affirmation is false, it will be impossible to assert and deny\n\t\t\t\t\twith truth the same thing at the same time. But perhaps it\n\t\t\t\t\twill be said that this is the point at issue.Again, is the man wrong who supposes that a thing\n\t\t\t\t\tis so or not so, and he who supposes both right? If he is right, what\n\t\t\t\t\tis the meaning of saying that \"such is the nature of reality\"? And if he is not\n\t\t\t\t\tright, but is more right than the holder of the first view, reality\n\t\t\t\t\twill at once have a definite nature, and this will be true, and not at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same time not-true.And if all men are equally right and wrong, an exponent of this view\n\t\t\t\t\tcan neither speak nor mean anything, since at the same time he says\n\t\t\t\t\tboth \"yes\" and \"no.\" And if he forms no judgement, but \"thinks\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"thinks not\" indifferently, what difference will there be between him\n\t\t\t\t\tand the vegetables?Hence it is quite\n\t\t\t\t\tevident that no one, either of those who profess this theory or of any\n\t\t\t\t\tother school, is really in this position.Otherwise, why does a man walk to  and not stay at home, when\n\t\t\t\t\the thinks he ought to make the journey? Why does he not walk early one\n\t\t\t\t\tmorning into a well or ravine, if he comes to it, instead of clearly\n\t\t\t\t\tguarding against doing so, thus showing that he does \n\t\t\t\t\tthink that it is equally good and not good to fall in? Obviously then\n\t\t\t\t\the judges that the one course is better and the other worse.And if this is so, he must\n\t\t\t\t\tjudge that one thing is man and another not man,and that one thing is sweet and another\n\t\t\t\t\tnot sweet. For when, thinking that it is desirable to drink water and\n\t\t\t\t\tsee a man, he goes to look for them, he does not look for and judge\n\t\t\t\t\tall things indifferently; and yet he should, if the same thing were\n\t\t\t\t\tequally man and not-man.But as we have said, there is no one who does not evidently avoid\n\t\t\t\t\tsome things and not others. Hence, as it seems, all men form\n\t\t\t\t\tunqualified judgements, if not about all things, at least about what\n\t\t\t\t\tis better or worse.And if\n\t\t\t\t\tthey do this by guesswork and without knowledge, they should be all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe more eager for truth; just as a sick man should be more eager for\n\t\t\t\t\thealth than a healthy man; for indeed the man who guesses, as\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrasted with him who knows, is not in a healthy relation to the\n\t\t\t\t\ttruth.Again, however much things may be \"so and not\n\t\t\t\t\tso,\" yet differences of degree are inherent in the nature of things.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor we should not say that 2 and 3 are equally even; nor are he who\n\t\t\t\t\tthinks that 4 is 5, and he who thinks it is 1000, equally wrong: hence\n\t\t\t\t\tif they are not equally wrong, the one is clearly less wrong, and so\n\t\t\t\t\tmore right.If then that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich has more the nature of something is nearer to that something,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere will be some truth to which the\n\t\t\t\t\tmore true is nearer. And even if there is not, still there is now\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething more certain and true, and we shall be freed from the\n\t\t\t\t\tundiluted doctrine which precludes any mental determination.From the same view proceeds the theory of Protagoras, and both alike\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be either true or false. For if all opinions and appearances are\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue, everything must be at once true and false; for many people form\n\t\t\t\t\tjudgements which are opposite to those of others, and imagine that\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who do not think the same as themselves are wrong: hence the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame thing must both be and not be.And if this is so, all opinions must be true;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor those who are wrong and those who are right think contrarily to\n\t\t\t\t\teach other. So if reality is of this nature, everyone will be\n\t\t\t\t\tright.Clearly then both these\n\t\t\t\t\ttheories proceed from the same mental outlook. But the method of\n\t\t\t\t\tapproach is not the same for all cases; for some require persuasion\n\t\t\t\t\tand others compulsion.The\n\t\t\t\t\tignorance of those who have formed this judgement through perplexity\n\t\t\t\t\tis easily remedied, because we are dealingnot with the theory but with their\n\t\t\t\t\tmental outlook; but those who hold the theory for its own sake can\n\t\t\t\t\tonly be cured by refuting the theory as expressed in their own speech\n\t\t\t\t\tand words.This view comes to those who are perplexed\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom their observation of sensible things. (1.) The belief that\n\t\t\t\t\tcontradictions and contraries can be true at the same time comes to\n\t\t\t\t\tthem from seeing the contraries generated from the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthing.Then if what\n\t\t\t\t\tis not cannot be generated, the thing must have existed before as both\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries equallyjust as Anaxagoras says that everything is mixed in\n\t\t\t\t\teverything; and also Democritus, for he too says that Void and Plenum are present\n\t\t\t\t\tequally in any part, and yet the latter  , and the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer .To those, then, who base their judgement on these considerations, we\n\t\t\t\t\tshall say that although in one sense their theory is correct, in\n\t\t\t\t\tanother they are mistaken. For \"being\" has two meanings, so that there\n\t\t\t\t\tis a sense in which something can be generated from \"not-being,\" and a\n\t\t\t\t\tsense in which it cannot; and a sense in which the same thing can at\n\t\t\t\t\tonce be and not be; but not in the same respect. For the same thing\n\t\t\t\t\tcan \"be\" contraries at the same time potentially, but not\n\t\t\t\t\tactually.And\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther, we shall request them to conceive another kind also of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance of existing things, in which there is absolutely no motion\n\t\t\t\t\tor destruction or generation. And (2.) similarly\n\t\t\t\t\tthe theory that there is truth in appearances has come to some people\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom an observation of sensible things.They think that the truth should not be judged\n\t\t\t\t\tby the number or fewness of its upholders; and they say that the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthing seems sweet to some who taste it, and bitter to others; so that\n\t\t\t\t\tif all men were diseased or all insane, except two or three who were\n\t\t\t\t\thealthy or sane, the latter would seem to be diseased or insane, and\n\t\t\t\t\tnot the others.And further\n\t\t\t\t\tthey say that many of the animals as well get from the same things\n\t\t\t\t\timpressions which are contrary to ours, and that the individual\n\t\t\t\t\thimself does not always think the same in matters of sense-perception.\n\t\t\t\t\tThus it is uncertain which of these impressions are true or false; for\n\t\t\t\t\tone kind is no more true than another, but equally so. And hence\n\t\t\t\t\tDemocritus says that either there is no truth or we cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscover it.And in general it is because they suppose that\n\t\t\t\t\tthought is sense-perception, and sense-perception physical alteration,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they say that the impression given through sense-perception is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily true; for it is on these grounds that both Empedocles and\n\t\t\t\t\tDemocritus and practically all the rest have become obsessed by such\n\t\t\t\t\topinions as these.For\n\t\t\t\t\tEmpedocles says that those who change their bodily condition change\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir thought:For according to that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is present to them doth thought increase in men.And in another passage he says:And as\n\t\t\t\t\tthey change into a different nature, so it ever comes to them to think\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferently.And Parmenides too declares in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same way:For as each at any time\n\t\t\t\t\thath the temperament of his many-jointed limbs, so thought comes to\n\t\t\t\t\tmen. For for each and every man the substance of his limbs is that\n\t\t\t\t\tvery thing which thinks; for thought is that which preponderates.There is also\n\t\t\t\t\trecorded a saying of Anaxagoras to some of his disciples, that things\n\t\t\t\t\twould be for them as they judged them to be.And they say that in Homer too clearly held\n\t\t\t\t\tthis view, because he made\n\t\t\t\t\tHector, when he was stunned by the blow, lie\n\t\t\t\t\twith thoughts derangedthus implying that even those who are\n\t\t\t\t\t\"out of their minds\" still think, although not the same thoughts.\n\t\t\t\t\tClearly then, if both are kinds of thought, reality also will be \"both\n\t\t\t\t\tso and not so.\"It is\n\t\t\t\t\talong this path that the consequences are most difficult; for if those\n\t\t\t\t\twho have the clearest vision of such truth as is possible (and these\n\t\t\t\t\tare they who seek and love it most) hold such opinions and make these\n\t\t\t\t\tpronouncements about the truth, surely those who are trying to be\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophers may well despair; for the pursuit of truth will be\n\t\t\t\t\t\"chasing birds in the air.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the reason why these men hold this\n\t\t\t\t\tview is that although they studied the truth about reality, they\n\t\t\t\t\tsupposed that reality is confined to sensible things, in which the\n\t\t\t\t\tnature of the Indeterminate, i.e. of Being in the sense which we have\n\t\t\t\t\texplained, is abundantly\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent. (Thus their statements, though plausible, are not\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue;this form of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe criticism is more suitable than that which Epicharmus applied to\n\t\t\t\t\tXenophanes.) And further, observing that all this indeterminate\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance is in motion, and that no true predication can be made of\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which changes, they supposed that it is impossible to make any\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue statement about that which is in all ways and entirely\n\t\t\t\t\tchangeable.For it\n\t\t\t\t\twas from this supposition that there blossomed forth the most extreme\n\t\t\t\t\tview of those which we have mentioned, that of the professed followers\n\t\t\t\t\tof Heraclitus, and such as Cratylus held, who ended by thinking that\n\t\t\t\t\tone need not say anything, and only moved his finger; and who\n\t\t\t\t\tcriticized Heraclitus for saying that one cannot enter the same river\n\t\t\t\t\ttwice, for he himself\n\t\t\t\t\theld that it cannot be done even once.But we shall\n\t\t\t\t\treply to this theory also that although that which is changeable\n\t\t\t\t\tsupplies them, when it changes, with some real ground for supposing\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it \"is not,\" yet there is something debatable in this; for that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is shedding any quality retains something of that which is being\n\t\t\t\t\tshed, and something of that which is coming to be must already\n\t\t\t\t\texist.And in general if a thing is\n\t\t\t\t\tceasing to be, there will be something there which  ;\n\t\t\t\t\tand if a thing is coming to be, that from which it comes and by which\n\t\t\t\t\tit is generated must  ; and this cannot go on to\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinity. But let us leave this line of argument and remark that\n\t\t\t\t\tquantitative and qualitative change are not the same.Let it be granted that there\n\t\t\t\t\tis nothing permanent in respect of quantity; but it is by the\n\t\t\t\t\t that we recognize everything. And again those\n\t\t\t\t\twho hold the theory that we are attacking deserve censure in that they\n\t\t\t\t\thave maintained about the whole material universe what they have\n\t\t\t\t\tobserved in the case of a mere minority of sensible things.For it is only the realm of\n\t\t\t\t\tsense around us which continues subject to destruction and generation,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut this is a practically negligible part of the whole; so that it\n\t\t\t\t\twould have been fairer for them to acquit the former on the ground of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe latter than to condemn the latter on account of the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer.Further, we shall\n\t\t\t\t\tobviously say to these thinkers too the same as we said some time\n\t\t\t\t\tago; for we must prove to them and\n\t\t\t\t\tconvince them that there is a kind of nature that is not\n\t\t\t\t\tmoved(and yet those\n\t\t\t\t\twho claim that things can at once be and not be are logically\n\t\t\t\t\tcompelled to admit rather that all things are at rest than that they\n\t\t\t\t\tare in motion; for there is nothing for them to change into, since\n\t\t\t\t\teverything exists in everything). And as concerning\n\t\t\t\t\treality, that not every appearance is real, we shall say, first, that\n\t\t\t\t\tindeed the perception, at least of the proper object of a sense, is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot false, but the impression we get of it is not the same as the\n\t\t\t\t\tperception.And then\n\t\t\t\t\twe may fairly express surprise if our opponents raise the question\n\t\t\t\t\twhether magnitudes and colors are really such as they appear at a\n\t\t\t\t\tdistance or close at hand, as they appear to the healthy or to the\n\t\t\t\t\tdiseased; and whether heavy things are as they appear to the weak or\n\t\t\t\t\tto the strong; and whether truth is as it appears to the waking or to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sleeping.For clearly\n\t\t\t\t\tthey do not really believe the latter alternativeat any\n\t\t\t\t\trate no one, if in the night he thinks that he is at  whereas he is really in\n\t\t\t\t\t, starts off to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Odeum. And again concerning the\n\t\t\t\t\tfuture (as indeed Plato says)\n\t\t\t\t\tthe opinion of the doctor and that of the layman are presumably not\n\t\t\t\t\tequally reliable, e.g. as to whether a man will get well or\n\t\t\t\t\tnot.And again in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case of the senses themselves, our perception of a foreign object\n\t\t\t\t\tand of an object proper to a given sense, or of a kindred object and\n\t\t\t\t\tof an actual object of that sense itself, is not equally reliable; but in the case of colors\n\t\t\t\t\tsight, and not taste, is authoritative, and in the case of flavor\n\t\t\t\t\ttaste, and not sight. But not one of the senses ever asserts at the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame time of the same object that it is \"so and not so.\"Nor even at another\n\t\t\t\t\ttimedoes it make a\n\t\t\t\t\tconflicting statement about the quality, but only about that to which\n\t\t\t\t\tthe quality belongs. I mean, e.g., that the same wine may seem, as the\n\t\t\t\t\tresult of its own change or of that of one's body, at one time sweet\n\t\t\t\t\tand at another not; but sweetness, such as it is when it exists, has\n\t\t\t\t\tnever yet changed, and there is no mistake about it, and that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tto be sweet is necessarily of such a nature.Yet all these theories destroy the possibility\n\t\t\t\t\tof anything's existing by necessity, inasmuch as they destroy the\n\t\t\t\t\texistence of its essence; for \"the necessary\" cannot be in one way and\n\t\t\t\t\tin another; and so if anything exists of necessity, it cannot be \"both\n\t\t\t\t\tso and not so.\"And in general, if only\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sensible exists, without animate things there would be nothing;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor there would be no sense-faculty.That there would be neither sensible qualities\n\t\t\t\t\tnor sensations is probably true(for these depend upon an effect produced in the\n\t\t\t\t\tpercipient), but that the substrates which cause the sensation should\n\t\t\t\t\tnot exist even apart from the sensation is impossible.For sensation is not of\n\t\t\t\t\titself, but there is something else too besides the sensation, which\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be prior to the sensation; because that which\n\t\t\t\t\tmoves is by nature prior to that which is moved, and this is no less\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue if the terms are correlative.But there are\n\t\t\t\t\tsome, both of those who really hold these convictions and of those who\n\t\t\t\t\tmerely profess these views, who raise a difficulty; they inquire who\n\t\t\t\t\tis to judge of the healthy man, and in general who is to judge rightly\n\t\t\t\t\tin each particular case. But such questions are like wondering whether\n\t\t\t\t\twe are at any given moment asleep or awake;and all problems of this kind amount to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame thing. These people demand a reason for everything. They want a\n\t\t\t\t\tstarting-point, and want to grasp it by demonstration; while it is\n\t\t\t\t\tobvious from their actions that they have no conviction. But their\n\t\t\t\t\tcase is just what we have stated before;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor they require a reason for things which have no reason, since the\n\t\t\t\t\tstarting-point of a demonstration is not a matter of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstration.The\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst class, then, may be readily convinced of this, because it is not\n\t\t\t\t\thard to grasp. But those who look only for cogency in argument look\n\t\t\t\t\tfor an impossibility, for they claim the right to contradict\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, and lose no time in doing so.Yet if not everything is relative, but some\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are self-existent, not every appearance will be true; for an\n\t\t\t\t\tappearance is an appearance to someone. And so he who says that\n\t\t\t\t\tallappearances are\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue makes everything relative.Hence those who demand something cogent in\n\t\t\t\t\targument, and at the same time claim to make out a case, must guard\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves by saying that the appearance is true; not in itself, but\n\t\t\t\t\t it appears, and at, the time when\n\t\t\t\t\tit appears, and in the  and . And if they make out a case without this\n\t\t\t\t\tqualification, as a result they will soon contradict\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves;for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible in the case of the same man for a thing to appear honey to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sight, but not to the taste, and for things to appear different to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sight of each of his two eyes, if their sight is unequal. For to\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who assert (for the reasons previously stated) that appearances are true, and that all things are therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tequally false and true, because they do not appear the same to all,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor always the same to the same person, but often have contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tappearances at the same time(since if one crosses the fingers touch says that an object is two,\n\t\t\t\t\twhile sight says that it is only one), we shall say \"but not to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame sense or to the same part of it in the same way and at the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime\"; so that with this qualification the appearance will be true.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut perhaps it is for this reason that\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who argue not from a sense of difficulty but for argument's sake\n\t\t\t\t\tare compelled to say that the appearance is not true in itself, but\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue to the percipient;and, as we have said before, are compelled also to make everything\n\t\t\t\t\trelative and dependent upon opinion and sensation, so that nothing has\n\t\t\t\t\thappened or will happen unless someone has first formed an opinion\n\t\t\t\t\tabout it; otherwise clearly all things would not be relative to\n\t\t\t\t\topinion.Further, if a thing is\n\t\t\t\t\tone, it is relative to one thing or to something determinate. And if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same thing is both a half and an equal, yet the equal is not\n\t\t\t\t\trelative to the double.If\n\t\t\t\t\tto the thinking subject \"man\" and the object of thought are the same,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"man\" will be not the thinking subject but the object of thought; and\n\t\t\t\t\tif each thing is to be regarded as relative to the thinking subject,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe thinking subject will be relative to an infinity of specifically\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent things.That the most certain of all beliefs is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat opposite statements are not both true at the same time, and what\n\t\t\t\t\tfollows for those who maintain that they are true, and why these\n\t\t\t\t\tthinkers maintain this, may be regarded as adequately stated. And\n\t\t\t\t\tsince the contradiction of a statement cannot be true at the same time\n\t\t\t\t\tof the same thing, it is obvious that contraries cannot apply at the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame time to the same thing.For in each pair of contraries one is a\n\t\t\t\t\tprivation no less than it is a contrarya privation of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance. And privation is the negation of a predicateto some defined genus. Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tif it is impossible at the same time to affirm and deny a thing truly,\n\t\t\t\t\tit is also impossible for contraries to apply to a thing at the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime; either both must apply in a modified sense, or one in a modified\n\t\t\t\t\tsense and the other absolutely.Nor indeed can\n\t\t\t\t\tthere be any intermediate between contrary statements, but of one\n\t\t\t\t\tthing we must either assert or deny one thing, whatever it may be.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis will be plain if we first define truth and falsehood. To say that\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is is not, or that what is not is, is false; but to say that what\n\t\t\t\t\tis is, and what is not is not, is true; and therefore also he who says\n\t\t\t\t\tthat a thing is or is not will say either what is true or what is\n\t\t\t\t\tfalse.But neither\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is nor what is not is said not to be  to be.\n\t\t\t\t\tFurther, an intermediate between contraries will be intermediate\n\t\t\t\t\teither as grey is between black and white, or as \"neither man nor\n\t\t\t\t\thorse\" is between man and horse. If in the latter sense, it cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tchange (for change is from not-good to good, or from good to\n\t\t\t\t\tnot-good);but in\n\t\t\t\t\tfact it is clearly always changing; for change can only be into the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite and the intermediate. And if it is a true intermediate, in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis case too there would be a kind of change into white not from\n\t\t\t\t\tnot-white; but in fact this is not seen.\n\t\t\t\t\tFurther, the understanding either affirms or denies\n\t\t\t\t\tevery object of understanding or thought (as is clear from the\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition)whenever it is right or wrong. When, in asserting or denying, it\n\t\t\t\t\tcombines the predicates in one way, it is right; when in the other, it\n\t\t\t\t\tis wrong.Again, unless it is maintained\n\t\t\t\t\tmerely for argument's sake, the intermediate must exist beside all\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary terms; so that one will say what is neither true nor false.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd it will exist beside what is and what is not; so that there will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe a form of change beside generation and destruction.Again, there will also be an intermediate in all classes in which\n\t\t\t\t\tthe negation of a term implies the contrary assertion; e.g., among\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers there will be a number which is neither odd nor not-odd. But\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is impossible, as is clear from the definition.Again, there will be an infinite progression, and\n\t\t\t\t\texisting things will be not only half as many again, but even\n\t\t\t\t\tmore.For again it\n\t\t\t\t\twill be possible to deny the intermediate in reference both to its\n\t\t\t\t\tassertion and to its negation, and the result will be something;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor its essence is something distinct.Again, when a man is asked whether a thing is white and says \"no,\"\n\t\t\t\t\the has denied nothing except that it is <white>, and its\n\t\t\t\t\tnot-being <white> is a negation.Now\n\t\t\t\t\tthis view has occurred to certain people in just the same way as other\n\t\t\t\t\tparadoxes have also occurred; for when they cannot find a way out from\n\t\t\t\t\teristic arguments, they submit to the argument and admit that the\n\t\t\t\t\tconclusion is true.Some,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, hold the theory for this kind of reason, and others because they\n\t\t\t\t\trequire an explanation for everything. In dealing with all such\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons the starting-point is from definition;and definition results from the\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity of their meaning something; because the formula, which their\n\t\t\t\t\tterm implies, will be a definition. The doctrine of Heraclitus, which says that\n\t\t\t\t\teverything is and is not, seems to\n\t\t\t\t\tmake all things true; and that of Anaxagoras seems to imply an intermediate in contradiction,\n\t\t\t\t\tso that all things are false; for when things are mixed, the mixture\n\t\t\t\t\tis neither good nor not-good; and so no statement is true.It is obvious from this analysis that the one-sided and sweeping\n\t\t\t\t\tstatements which some people make cannot be substantially\n\t\t\t\t\ttruesome maintaining that nothing is true (for they say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat there is no reason why the same rule should not apply to\n\t\t\t\t\teverything as applies to the commensurability of the diagonal of a\n\t\t\t\t\tsquare), and some that\n\t\t\t\t\teverything is true.These\n\t\t\t\t\ttheories are almost the same as that of Heraclitus. For the theory\n\t\t\t\t\twhich says that all things are true and all false also makes each of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese statements separately; so that if they are\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible in combination they are also impossible individually. And\n\t\t\t\t\tagain obviously there are contrary statements, which cannot be true at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same time. Nor can they all be false, although from what we have\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid, this might seem more possible.But in opposing all such theories we must\n\t\t\t\t\tdemand, as was said in our discussion above,\n\t\t\t\t\tnot that something should be or not be, but some significant\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement; and so we must argue from a definition, having first\n\t\t\t\t\tgrasped what \"falsehood\" or \"truth\" means. And if to assert what is\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue is nothing else than to deny what is false, everything cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\tfalse; for one part of the contradiction must be true.Further, if everything must be\n\t\t\t\t\teither asserted or denied, both parts cannot be false; for one and\n\t\t\t\t\tonly one part of the contradiction is false. Indeed, the consequence\n\t\t\t\t\tfollows which is notorious in the case of all such theories, that they\n\t\t\t\t\tdestroy themselves;for he\n\t\t\t\t\twho says that everything is true makes the opposite theory true too,\n\t\t\t\t\tand therefore his own untrue (for the opposite theory says that his is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot true); and he who says that everything is false makes himself a\n\t\t\t\t\tliar.And if they\n\t\t\t\t\tmake exceptions, the one that the opposite theory alone is not true,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the other that his own theory alone is not false,it follows none the less that they\n\t\t\t\t\tpostulate an infinite number of true and false statements. For the\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement that the true statement is true is also true; and this will\n\t\t\t\t\tgo on to infinity.Nor, as is obvious, are those right who\n\t\t\t\t\tsay that all things are at rest; nor those who say that all things are\n\t\t\t\t\tin motion. For if all things are at rest, the same things will always\n\t\t\t\t\tbe true and false, whereas this state of affairs is obviously subject\n\t\t\t\t\tto change; for the speaker himself once did not exist, and again he\n\t\t\t\t\twill not exist. And if all things are in motion, nothing will be true,\n\t\t\t\t\tso everything will be false; but this has been proved to be\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible.Again, it\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be that which  that changes, for change is from\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething into something. And further, neither is it true that all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are at rest or in motion sometimes, but nothing continuously;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor there is something  which always moves that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tmoved, and the \"prime mover\" is itself unmoved."}}, {"@n": "5", "@type": "Book", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1012b", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "34", "@ed": "Bekker", "@unit":

(b) The point from which each\n\t\t\t\t\tthing may best come into being; e.g., a course of study should\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes be begun not from what is primary or from the starting-point\n\t\t\t\t\tof the subject, but from the point from which it is easiest to learn.\n\t\t\t\t\t(c) That thing as a result of whose presence something first comes\n\t\t\t\t\tinto being; e.g., as the keel is the beginning of a ship, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tfoundation that of a house, and as in the case of animals some\n\t\t\t\t\tthinkers suppose the heart to be the \"beginning,\" others the\n\t\t\t\t\tbrain, and others something\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar, whatever it may be. (d) That from which, although not present\n\t\t\t\t\tin it, a thing first comes into being, and that from which motion and\n\t\t\t\t\tchange naturally first begin, as the child comes from the father and\n\t\t\t\t\tmother, and fighting from abuse. (e) That in accordance with whose\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliberate choice that which is moved is moved, and that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tchanged is changed; such as magistracies, authorities, monarchies and\n\t\t\t\t\tdespotisms.(f) Arts\n\t\t\t\t\tare also called \"beginnings,\" especially the architectonic arts.\n\t\t\t\t\t(g) Again, \"beginning\" means the point from which a thing is first\n\t\t\t\t\tcomprehensible, this too is called the \"beginning\" of the thing; e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tthe hypotheses of demonstrations. (\"Cause\" can have a similar number\n\t\t\t\t\tof different senses, for all causes are \"beginnings.\")It is a common property, then, of all \"beginnings\" to be the first\n\t\t\t\t\tthing from which something either exists or comes into being or\n\t\t\t\t\tbecomes known; and some beginnings are originally inherent in things,\n\t\t\t\t\twhile others are not.Hence\n\t\t\t\t\t\"nature\" is a beginning, and so is \"element\" and \"understanding\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"choice\" and \"essence\" and \"final cause\"for in many cases\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Good and the Beautiful are the beginning both of knowledge and of\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion.\"Cause\" means: (a) in one sense, that as the\n\t\t\t\t\tresult of whose presence something comes into beinge.g. the\n\t\t\t\t\tbronze of a statue and the silver of a cup, and the classes which contain these;\n\t\t\t\t\t(b) in another sense, the  or pattern; that is, the\n\t\t\t\t\tessential formula and the classes which contain ite.g. the\n\t\t\t\t\tratio 2:1 and number in general is the cause of the\n\t\t\t\t\toctaveand the parts of the formula.(c) The source of the first beginning\n\t\t\t\t\tof change or rest; e.g. the man who plans is a cause, and the father\n\t\t\t\t\tis the cause of the child, and in general that which produces is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of that which is produced, and that which changes of that which\n\t\t\t\t\tis changed. (d) The same as \"end\"; i.e. the final cause; e.g., as the\n\t\t\t\t\t\"end\" of walking is health.For why does a man walk? \"To be healthy,\" we say, and by saying this\n\t\t\t\t\twe consider that we have supplied the cause. (e) All those means\n\t\t\t\t\ttowards the end which arise at the instigation of something else, as,\n\t\t\t\t\te.g. fat-reducing, purging, drugs and instruments are causes of\n\t\t\t\t\thealth; for they all have the \n\t\t\t\t\tas their object, although they differ from each other as being some\n\t\t\t\t\tinstruments, others actions.These are roughly all the\n\t\t\t\t\tmeanings of \"cause,\" but since causes are spoken of with various\n\t\t\t\t\tmeanings, it follows that there are several causes (and that not in an\n\t\t\t\t\taccidental sense) of the same thing. E.g., both \n\t\t\t\t\tand  are causes of the statue; not in different\n\t\t\t\t\tconnections, but  statue. However, they are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot causes in the same way, but the one as  and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other as the . And things are causes\n\t\t\t\t\tof each other; as e.g. labor of vigor, and vigor of\n\t\t\t\t\tlaborbut not in the same way; the one as an\n\t\t\t\t\t , and the other as  of\n\t\t\t\t\t .And again the same thing is sometimes the cause of contrary results;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause that which by its presence is the cause of so-and-so we\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes accuse of being, by its absence, the cause of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraryas, e.g., we say that the absence of the pilot is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cause of a capsize, whereas his presence was the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tsafety.And both,\n\t\t\t\t\tpresence and privation, are  causes.Now there are four senses which are most\n\t\t\t\t\tobvious under which all the causes just described may be\n\t\t\t\t\tclassed.The\n\t\t\t\t\tcomponents of syllables; the material of manufactured articles; fire,\n\t\t\t\t\tearth and all such bodies; the parts of a whole;and the premisses of a syllogistic\n\t\t\t\t\tconclusion; are causes in the  sense. Of these\n\t\t\t\t\tsome are causes as substrate: e.g. the parts; and others as\n\t\t\t\t\t : the whole, and the composition, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tform.The seed and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe physician and the contriver and in general that which produces,\n\t\t\t\t\tall these are the source of change or stationariness. The remainder\n\t\t\t\t\trepresent the  and  of the others;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the final cause tends to be the greatest good and \n\t\t\t\t\tof the rest.Let it be\n\t\t\t\t\tassumed that it makes no difference whether we call it \"good\" or\n\t\t\t\t\t\"apparent good.\" In  , then, there are these four\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses of cause.The \n\t\t\t\t\tof cause are numerically many, although these too are fewer when\n\t\t\t\t\tsummarized.For\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses are spoken of in many senses, and even of those which are of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same kind, some are causes in a prior and some in a posterior\n\t\t\t\t\tsense; e.g., the physician and the expert are both causes of health;\n\t\t\t\t\tand the ratio 2:1 and number are both causes of the octave; and the\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversals which include a given cause are causes of its particular\n\t\t\t\t\teffects.Again, a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing may be a cause in the sense of an accident, and the classes\n\t\t\t\t\twhich contain accidents; e.g., the cause of a statue is in one sense\n\t\t\t\t\tPolyclitus and in another a sculptor, because it is an accident of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsculptor to be Polyclitus. And the universal\n\t\t\t\t\tterms which include accidents are causes; e.g., the cause of a statue\n\t\t\t\t\tis a man, or even, generally, an animal; because Polyclitus is a man,\n\t\t\t\t\tand man is an animal.And\n\t\t\t\t\teven of accidental causes some are remoter or more proximate than\n\t\t\t\t\tothers; e.g., the cause of the statue might be said to be \"white man\"\n\t\t\t\t\tor \"cultured man,\" and not merely \"Polyclitus\" or \"man.\"And besides the distinction of causes as\n\t\t\t\t\t and  , some are\n\t\t\t\t\ttermed causes in a  and others in an\n\t\t\t\t\t sense; e.g., the cause of building is either\n\t\t\t\t\tthe builder or the builder who builds.And the same distinctions in meaning as we\n\t\t\t\t\thave already described will apply to the  of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses; e.g. to  statue, or  statue, or\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally an image; and to  bronze, or bronze, or\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally material. And it is the same with accidental effects. Again, the\n\t\t\t\t\tproper and accidental senses will be combined; e.g., the cause is\n\t\t\t\t\tneither \"Polyclitus\" nor \"a sculptor\" but \"the sculptor\n\t\t\t\t\tPolyclitus.\"However, these classes of cause are in\n\t\t\t\t\tall six in number, each used in two senses. Causes are (1.)\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular, (2.) generic, (3.) accidental, (4.) generically\n\t\t\t\t\taccidental; and these may be either stated singly or (5, 6) in\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination;and\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther they are all either actual or potential.And there is this difference between\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, that actual and particular causes coexist or do not coexist with\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir effects (e.g.  man giving medical treatment\n\t\t\t\t\twith  man recovering his health, and\n\t\t\t\t\t builder with  building in course of\n\t\t\t\t\terection); but potential causes do not always do so; for the house and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe builder do not perish together.\"Element\" means\n\t\t\t\t\t(a) the primary immanent thing, formally indivisible into another\n\t\t\t\t\tform, of which something is composed. E.g., the elements of a sound\n\t\t\t\t\tare the parts of which that sound is composed and into which it is\n\t\t\t\t\tultimately divisible, and which are not further divisible into other\n\t\t\t\t\tsounds formally different from themselves. If an element be divided,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe parts are formally the same as the whole: e.g., a part of water is\n\t\t\t\t\twater; but it is not so with the syllable.(b) Those who speak of the elements of\n\t\t\t\t\t similarly mean the parts into which bodies\n\t\t\t\t\tare ultimately divisible, and which are not further divisible into\n\t\t\t\t\tother parts different in form. And whether they speak of one such\n\t\t\t\t\telement or of more than one, this is what they mean.(c) The term is applied with a very\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar meaning to the \"elements\" of geometrical figures, and\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally to the \"elements\" of demonstrations; for the primary\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstrations which are contained in a number of other demonstrations\n\t\t\t\t\tare called \"elements\" of\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstrations. Such are the\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary syllogisms consisting of three terms and with one middle\n\t\t\t\t\tterm.(d) The term\n\t\t\t\t\t\"element\" is also applied metaphorically to any small unity which is\n\t\t\t\t\tuseful for various purposes; and so that which is small or simple or\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible is called an \"element.\"(e) Hence it comes that the most universal\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are elements; because each of them, being a simple unity, is\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent in many thingseither in all or in as many as\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible. Some too think that unity and the point are first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples.(f)\n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore since what are called genera are universal and indivisible (because they\n\t\t\t\t\thave no formula), some people call the genera elements, and these\n\t\t\t\t\trather than the differentia, because the genus is more universal. For\n\t\t\t\t\twhere the differentia is present, the genus also follows; but the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentia is not always present where the genus is. And it is common\n\t\t\t\t\tto all cases that the element of each thing is that which is primarily\n\t\t\t\t\tinherent in each thing.\"Nature\"\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans: (a) in one sense, the genesis of growing thingsas\n\t\t\t\t\twould be suggested by pronouncing the  of \n\t\t\t\t\tlongand (b) in another, that immanent thing from which a growing thing first begins to grow. (c)\n\t\t\t\t\tThe source from which the primary motion in every natural object is\n\t\t\t\t\tinduced in that object as such.All things are said to grow which gain increase\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough something else by contact and organic unity (or adhesion, as\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of embryos).Organic unity differs from contact; for in the latter case there\n\t\t\t\t\tneed be nothing except contact, but in both the things which form an\n\t\t\t\t\torganic unity there is some one and the same thing which produces,\n\t\t\t\t\tinstead of mere contact, a unity which is organic, continuous and\n\t\t\t\t\tquantitative (but not qualitative).Again, \"nature\" means (d) the primary stuff,\n\t\t\t\t\tshapeless and unchangeable from its own potency, of which any natural\n\t\t\t\t\tobject consists or from which it is produced; e.g., bronze is called\n\t\t\t\t\tthe \"nature\" of a statue and of bronze articles, and wood that of\n\t\t\t\t\twooden ones, and similarly in all other cases.For each article consists of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\"natures,\" the primary material persisting. It is in this sense that\n\t\t\t\t\tmen call the elements of natural objects the \"nature,\" some calling it\n\t\t\t\t\tfire, others earth or air or water, others something else similar,\n\t\t\t\t\tothers some of these, and others all of them.Again in another sense \"nature\" means (e) the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance of natural objects; as in the case of those who say that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\"nature\" is the primary composition of a thing, or as Empedocles says:\n\t\t\t\t\tOf nothing that exists is there nature,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut only mixture and separation of what has been mixed; nature is but\n\t\t\t\t\ta name given to these by men.Hence as regards those things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich exist or are produced by nature, although that from which they\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally are produced or exist is already present, we say that they\n\t\t\t\t\thave not their nature yet unless they have their form and\n\t\t\t\t\tshape.That which\n\t\t\t\t\tcomprises both of these exists by nature; e.g. animals and their\n\t\t\t\t\tparts. And nature is both the primary matter (and this in two senses:\n\t\t\t\t\teither primary in relation to the thing, or primary in general; e.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tin bronze articles the primary matter in relation to those articles is\n\t\t\t\t\tbronze, but in general it is perhaps waterthat is if all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which can be melted are water) and the form or essence, i.e.\n\t\t\t\t\tthe end of the process, of generation. Indeed from this sense of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"nature,\" by an extension of meaning, every essence in general is\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled \"nature,\" because the nature of anything is a kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tessence.From what has been said, then, the primary and\n\t\t\t\t\tproper sense of \"nature\" is the essence of those things which contain\n\t\t\t\t\tin themselves as such a source of motion; for the matter is called\n\t\t\t\t\t\"nature\" because it is capable of receiving the nature, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tprocesses of generation and growth are called \"nature\" because they\n\t\t\t\t\tare motions derived from it. And nature in this sense is the source of\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion in natural objects, which is somehow inherent in them, either\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially or actually.\"Necessary\" means: (a) That without which, as\n\t\t\t\t\ta concomitant condition, life is impossible; e.g. respiration and food\n\t\t\t\t\tare necessary for an animal, because it cannot exist without them. (b)\n\t\t\t\t\tThe conditions without which good cannot be or come to be, or without\n\t\t\t\t\twhich one cannot get rid or keep free of evile.g., drinking\n\t\t\t\t\tmedicine is necessary to escape from ill-health, and sailing to\n\t\t\t\t\t is necessary to\n\t\t\t\t\trecover one's money.(c)\n\t\t\t\t\tThe compulsory and compulsion; i.e. that which hinders and prevents,\n\t\t\t\t\tin opposition to impulse and purpose. For the compulsory is called\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary, and hence the necessary is disagreeable; as indeed\n\t\t\t\t\tEvenus says: \"For every necessary\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is by nature grievous.\"And compulsion is a kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity, as Sophocles says: \"Compulsion makes me do this of\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity.\"And necessity\n\t\t\t\t\tis held, rightly, to be something inexorable; for it is opposed to\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion which is in accordance with purpose and calculation. (d) Again,\n\t\t\t\t\twhat cannot be otherwise we say is necessarily so.It is from this sense of \"necessary\"\n\t\t\t\t\tthat all others are somehow derived; for the term \"compulsory\" is used\n\t\t\t\t\tof something which it is necessary for one to do or suffer only when it is impossible to act according to\n\t\t\t\t\timpulse, because of the compulsion: which shows that necessity is that\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause of which a thing cannot be otherwise; and the same is true of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe concomitant conditions of living and of the good. For when in the\n\t\t\t\t\tone case good, and in the other life or existence, is impossible\n\t\t\t\t\twithout certain conditions, these conditions are necessary, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause is a kind of necessity.(e) Again, demonstration is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\"necessary\" thing, because a thing cannot be otherwise if the\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstration has been absolute. And this is the result of the first\n\t\t\t\t\tpremisses, when it is impossible for the assumptions upon which the\n\t\t\t\t\tsyllogism depends to be otherwise.Thus\n\t\t\t\t\tof necessary things, some have an external cause of their necessity,\n\t\t\t\t\tand others have not, but it is through them that other things are of\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity what they are.Hence the \"necessary\" in the primary and proper sense is the\n\t\t\t\t\t , for it cannot be in more than one\n\t\t\t\t\tcondition. Hence it cannot be in one state and in another; for if so\n\t\t\t\t\tit would ipso facto be in more than one condition. Therefore if there\n\t\t\t\t\tare certain things which are eternal and immutable, there is nothing\n\t\t\t\t\tin them which is compulsory or which violates their nature.The term \"one\" is used (1.) in an accidental, (2.) in an absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tsense. (1.) In the accidental sense it is used as in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Coriscus\" and \"cultured\" and \"cultured Coriscus\" (for\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Coriscus\" and \"cultured\" and \"cultured Coriscus\" mean the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame);and \"cultured\"\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"upright\"and \"cultured\n\t\t\t\t\tupright Coriscus.\" For all these terms refer accidentally to one\n\t\t\t\t\tthing; \"upright\" and \"cultured\" because they are accidental to one\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, and \"cultured\" and \"Coriscus\" because the one is accidental\n\t\t\t\t\tto the other.And similarly\n\t\t\t\t\tin one sense \"cultured Coriscus\" is one with \"Coriscus,\" because one\n\t\t\t\t\tpart of the expression is accidental to the other, e.g. \"cultured\" to\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Coriscus\"; and \"cultured Coriscus\" is one with \"upright Coriscus,\"\n\t\t\t\t\tbecauseone part of\n\t\t\t\t\teach expression is one accident of one and the same thing. It is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame even if the accident is applied to a genus or a general term;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g., \"man\" and \"cultured man\" are the same, either because \"cultured\"\n\t\t\t\t\tis an accident of \"man,\" which is one substance, or because both are\n\t\t\t\t\taccidents of some individual, e.g. Coriscus.But they do not both belong to it in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tway; the one belongs presumably as  in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, and the other as  or\n\t\t\t\t\t of the substance. Thus all things which are\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid to be \"one\" in an accidental sense are said to be so in this\n\t\t\t\t\tway.(2.) Of those things which are said to be in\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves one, (a) some are said to be so in virtue of their\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinuity; e.g., a faggot is made continuous by its string, and\n\t\t\t\t\tpieces of wood by glue; and a continuous\n\t\t\t\t\tline, even if it is bent, is said to be one, just like each of the\n\t\t\t\t\tlimbs; e.g. the leg or arm. And of these things themselves those which\n\t\t\t\t\tare naturally continuous are one in a truer sense than those which are\n\t\t\t\t\tartificially continuous.\"Continuous\" means that whose motion is essentially one, and cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tbe otherwise; and motion is one when it is indivisible, i.e.\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible in  . Things are essentially continuous\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are one not by contact only; for if you put pieces of wood\n\t\t\t\t\ttouching one another you will not say that they are \n\t\t\t\t\tpiece of wood, or body, or any other continuous thing.And things which are completely\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinuous are said to be \"one\" even if they contain a joint, and\n\t\t\t\t\tstill more those things which contain no joint; e.g., the shin or the\n\t\t\t\t\tthigh is more truly one than the leg, because the motion of the leg\n\t\t\t\t\tmay not be one.And the\n\t\t\t\t\tstraight line is more truly one than the bent. We call the line which\n\t\t\t\t\tis bent and contains an angle both one and not one, because it may or\n\t\t\t\t\tmay not move all at once; but the straight line always moves all at\n\t\t\t\t\tonce, and no part of it which has magnitude is at rest while another\n\t\t\t\t\tmoves, as in the bent line.(b) Another\n\t\t\t\t\tsense of \"one\" is that the substrate is uniform in kind.Things are uniform whose form\n\t\t\t\t\tis indistinguishable to sensation;and the substrate is either that which is primary,\n\t\t\t\t\tor that which is final in relation to the end. For wine is said to be\n\t\t\t\t\tone, and water one, as being something formally indistinguishable. And\n\t\t\t\t\tall liquids are said to be one (e.g. oil and wine), and melted things;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the ultimate substrate of all of them is the same, for all\n\t\t\t\t\tthese things are water or vapor.(c) Things are\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid to be \"one\" whose genus is one and differs in its opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiae. All these things too are said to be \"one\" because the\n\t\t\t\t\tgenus, which is the substrate of the differentiae, is one (e.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"horse,\" \"man\" and \"dog\" are in a sense one, because they are all\n\t\t\t\t\tanimals); and that in a way very similar to that in which the matter\n\t\t\t\t\tis one.Sometimes these\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are said to be \"one\" in this sense, and sometimes their higher\n\t\t\t\t\tgenus is said to be one and the same (if they are final species of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir genus)the genus, that is, which is above the genera\n\t\t\t\t\tof which their proximate genus is one; e.g., the isosceles and\n\t\t\t\t\tequilateral triangles are one and the same figure (because they are\n\t\t\t\t\tboth triangles), but not the same triangles.(d)\n\t\t\t\t\tAgain, things are said to be \"one\" when the definition stating the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence of one is indistinguishable from a definition explaining the\n\t\t\t\t\tother; for in itself every definition is distinguishable <into\n\t\t\t\t\tgenus and differentiae>. In this way that which increases and\n\t\t\t\t\tdecreases is one, because its definition is one; just as in the case\n\t\t\t\t\tof planes the definition of the form is one. And in general\n\t\t\t\t\tthose things whose concept, which conceives the essence, is\n\t\t\t\t\tindistinguishable and cannot be separated either in time or in place\n\t\t\t\t\tor in definition, are in the truest sense one; and of these such as\n\t\t\t\t\tare substances are most truly one. For universally such things as do\n\t\t\t\t\tnot admit of distinction are called \"one\" in so far as they do not\n\t\t\t\t\tadmit of it; e.g., if \"man\"  \"man\" does not\n\t\t\t\t\tadmit of distinction, he is one man; and similarly if  animal, he is one animal; and if  magnitude, he is one magnitude.Most things, then, are said to be \"one\" because they produce, or\n\t\t\t\t\tpossess, or are affected by, or are related to, some other one thing;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut some are called \"one\" in a primary sense, and one of these is\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance. It is one either in continuity or in form or in definition;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor we reckon as more than one things which are not continuous, or\n\t\t\t\t\twhose form is not one, or whose definition is not one.Again, in one sense we call\n\t\t\t\t\tanything whatever \"one\" if it is quantitative and continuous; and in\n\t\t\t\t\tanother sense we say that it is not \"one\" unless it is a\n\t\t\t\t\t of some kind, i.e. unless it is one in form (e.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tif we saw the parts of a shoe put together anyhow, we should not say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they were one  except in virtue of their continuity;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut only if they were so put together as to be a shoe, and to possess\n\t\t\t\t\talready some one form).Hence the circumference of a circle is of all lines the most truly\n\t\t\t\t\tone, because it is whole and complete.The essence of \"one\" is to be a kind of starting point of number;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the first measure is a starting point, because that by which first\n\t\t\t\t\twe gain knowledge of a thing is the first measure of each class of\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects.\"The one,\"\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, is the starting-point of what is knowable in respect of each\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular thing. But the unit is not the same in all\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses,for in one\n\t\t\t\t\tit is the quarter-tone, and in another the vowel or consonant; gravity\n\t\t\t\t\thas another unit, and motion another. But in all cases the unit is\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible, either quantitatively or formally.Thus that which is quantitatively and\n\t\t\t\t\t quantitative wholly indivisible and\n\t\t\t\t\thas no position is called a unit; and that which is wholly indivisible\n\t\t\t\t\tand has position, a point; that which is divisible in one sense, a\n\t\t\t\t\tline; in two senses, a plane; and that which is quantitatively\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisible in all three senses, a body.And reversely that which is divisible in two\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses is a plane, and in one sense a line; and that which is in no\n\t\t\t\t\tsense quantitatively divisible is a point or a unit; if it has no\n\t\t\t\t\tposition, a unit, and if it has position, a point.Again,\n\t\t\t\t\tsome things are one numerically, others formally, others generically,\n\t\t\t\t\tand others analogically; numerically, those whose matter is one;\n\t\t\t\t\tformally, those whose definition is one; generically, those which\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to the same category; and analogically, those which have the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame relation as something else to some third object.In every case the latter types\n\t\t\t\t\tof unity are implied in the former: e.g., all things which are one\n\t\t\t\t\tnumerically are also one formally, but not all which are one formally\n\t\t\t\t\tare one numerically; and all are one generically which\n\t\t\t\t\tare one formally, but such as are one generically are not all one\n\t\t\t\t\tformally, although they are one analogically; and such as are one\n\t\t\t\t\tanalogically are not all one generically.It is obvious\n\t\t\t\t\talso that \"many\" will have the opposite meanings to \"one.\" Some things\n\t\t\t\t\tare called \"many\" because they are not continuous; others because\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir matter (either primary or ultimate) is formally divisible;\n\t\t\t\t\tothers because the definitions of their essence are more than\n\t\t\t\t\tone.\"Being\" means (1.) accidental being, (2.)\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolute being. (1.) E.g., we say that the upright person \"is\"\n\t\t\t\t\tcultured, and that the man \"is\" cultured, and that the cultured person\n\t\t\t\t\t\"is\" a man; very much as we say that the cultured person builds,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the builder happens to be cultured, or the cultured person a\n\t\t\t\t\tbuilder; for in this sense \"X is Y\" means that Y is an accident of\n\t\t\t\t\tX.And so it is with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe examples cited above; for when we say that \"the man is cultured\"\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"the cultured person is a man\" or \"the white is cultured\" or \"the\n\t\t\t\t\tcultured is white,\" in the last two cases it is because both\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicates are accidental to the same subject, and in the first case\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the predicate is accidental to what  ; and we\n\t\t\t\t\tsay that \"the cultured is a man\" because \"the cultured\" is accidental\n\t\t\t\t\tto a man.(Similarly\n\t\t\t\t\t\"not-white\" is said to \"be,\" because the subject of which \"not-white\"\n\t\t\t\t\tis an accident,  .)These, then, are the senses in which things are\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid to \"be\" accidentally: either because both predicates belong to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same subject, which  ; or because the predicate\n\t\t\t\t\tbelongs to the subject, which  ; or because the subject\n\t\t\t\t\tto which belongs that of which it is itself predicated itself\n\t\t\t\t\t .(2.) The senses of essential being are\n\t\t\t\t\tthose which are indicated by the figures of predication; for \"being\" has as many senses as there\n\t\t\t\t\tare ways of predication. Now since some predicates indicate (a) what a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is, and others its (b) quality, (c) quantity, (d) relation, (e)\n\t\t\t\t\tactivity or passivity, (f) place, (g) time, to each of these\n\t\t\t\t\tcorresponds a sense of \"being.\"There is no difference between \"the man is\n\t\t\t\t\trecovering\" and \"the man recovers\"; or between \"the man is walking\" or\n\t\t\t\t\t\"cutting\" and \"the man walks\" or \"cuts\"; and similarly in the other\n\t\t\t\t\tcases.(3.) Again, \"to be\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"is\" mean that a thing is true, and \"not to be\" that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tfalse.Similarly too\n\t\t\t\t\tin affirmation and negation; e.g., in \"\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates is cultured\" \"is\" means that this is true;\n\t\t\t\t\tor in \"Socrates is not-white\"\n\t\t\t\t\tthat this is true; but in \"the diagonal is not commensurable\"\"is not\" means that the statement is\n\t\t\t\t\tfalse. (4.) Again, \"to be\" <or\n\t\t\t\t\t\"is\"> means that some of these statements can be made in virtue\n\t\t\t\t\tof a potentiality and others in virtue of an actuality.For we say that both that which\n\t\t\t\t\tsees potentially and that which sees actually  \"a\n\t\t\t\t\tseeing thing.\" And in the same way we call \"understanding\" both that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich  use the understanding, and that which\n\t\t\t\t\t ; and we call \"tranquil\" both that in which\n\t\t\t\t\ttranquillity is already present, and that which is potentially\n\t\t\t\t\ttranquil.Similarly\n\t\t\t\t\ttoo in the case of substances. For we say that Hermes is in the\n\t\t\t\t\tstone,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the half of the line in the whole; and we call \"corn\" what is not\n\t\t\t\t\tyet ripe. But when a thing is potentially existent and when not, must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe defined elsewhere.\"Substance\" means (a) simple\n\t\t\t\t\tbodies, e.g. earth, fire, water and the like; and in general bodies,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the things, animal or divine, including their parts, which are\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of bodies. All these are called substances because they are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot predicated of any substrate, but other things are predicated of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem.(b) In another\n\t\t\t\t\tsense, whatever, being immanent in such things as are not predicated\n\t\t\t\t\tof a substrate, is the cause of their being; as, e.g., the soul is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of being for the animal.(c) All parts immanent in things which define\n\t\t\t\t\tand indicate their individuality, and whose destruction causes the\n\t\t\t\t\tdestruction of the whole; as, e.g., the plane is essential to the body\n\t\t\t\t\t(as some hold) and the line to the plane.And number in general is thought\n\t\t\t\t\tby some to be of this nature, on the ground that if\n\t\t\t\t\tit is abolished nothing exists, and that it determines\n\t\t\t\t\teverything.(d)\n\t\t\t\t\tAgain, the  , whose formula is the definition, is\n\t\t\t\t\talso called the substance of each particular thing.Thus it follows that \"substance\" has two senses:\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ultimate subject, which cannot be further predicated of something\n\t\t\t\t\telse; and whatever has an individual and separate existence. The shape\n\t\t\t\t\tand form of each particular thing is of this nature.\"The\n\t\t\t\t\tsame\" means (a) accidentally the same. E.g., \"white\" and \"cultured\"\n\t\t\t\t\tare the same because they are accidents of the same subject; and \"man\"\n\t\t\t\t\tis the same as \"cultured,\" because one is an accident of the other;\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"cultured\" is the same as \"man\" because it is an accident of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"man\"; and \"cultured man\" is the same as each of the terms \"cultured\"\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"man,\" and vice versa; for both \"man\" and \"cultured\" are used in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same way as \"cultured man,\" and the latter in the same way as the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer.Hence none of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese predications can be made universally. For it is not true to say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat every man is the same as \"the cultured\"; because universal\n\t\t\t\t\tpredications are essential to things, but\n\t\t\t\t\taccidental predications are not so, but are made of individuals and\n\t\t\t\t\twith a single application. \"\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates\" and \"cultured\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates\" seem to be the same; but \"\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates\" is not a class-name, and\n\t\t\t\t\thence we do not say \"every\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates\" as we say \"every man.\"Some things are said to be \"the same\" in this\n\t\t\t\t\tsense, but (b) others in an essential sense, in the same number of\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses as \"the one\" is essentially one; for things whose matter is\n\t\t\t\t\tformally or numerically one, and things whose substance is one, are\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid to be the same. Thus \"sameness\" is clearly a kind of unity in the\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing, either of two or more things, or of one thing treated as more\n\t\t\t\t\tthan one; as, e.g., when a thing is consistent with itself; for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tthen treated as two.Things are called \"other\" of which\n\t\t\t\t\teither the forms or the matter or the definition of essence is more\n\t\t\t\t\tthan one; and in general \"other\" is used in the opposite senses to\n\t\t\t\t\t\"same.\"Things are called\n\t\t\t\t\t\"different\" which, while being in a sense the same, are \"other\" not\n\t\t\t\t\tonly numerically, but formally or generically or analogically; also\n\t\t\t\t\tthings whose genus is not the same; and contraries; and all things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich contain \"otherness\" in their essence.Things\n\t\t\t\t\tare called \"like\" which have the same attributes in all respects; or\n\t\t\t\t\tmore of those attributes the same than different; or whose quality is\n\t\t\t\t\tone. Also that which has a majority or the more important of those\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes of something else in respect of which change is possible\n\t\t\t\t\t(i.e. the contraries) is like that thing. And \"unlike\" is used in the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite senses to \"like.\"The term \"opposite\" is applied to (a)\n\t\t\t\t\tcontradiction; (b) contraries; (c) relative terms; (d) privation; (e)\n\t\t\t\t\tstate; (f) extremes; e.g. in the process of generation and\n\t\t\t\t\tdestruction. And (g) all things which cannot be present at the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime in that which admits of them both are called opposites; either\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves or their constituents. \"Grey\" and \"white\" do not apply at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same time to the same thing, and hence their constituents are\n\t\t\t\t\topposite.\"Contrary\" means: (a) attributes,\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerically different, which cannot apply at the same time to the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthing. (b) The most different attributes in the same genus; or (c) in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same subject; or (d) falling under the same faculty. (e) Things\n\t\t\t\t\twhose difference is greatest absolutely, or in genus, or in\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies.Other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are called \"contrary\" either because they possess attributes of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis kind, or because they are receptive of them, or because they are\n\t\t\t\t\tproductive of or liable to them, or actually produce or incur them, or\n\t\t\t\t\tare rejections or acquisitions or possessions or privations of such\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes.And\n\t\t\t\t\tsince \"one\" and \"being\" have various meanings, all other terms which\n\t\t\t\t\tare used in relation to \"one\" and \"being\" must vary in meaning with\n\t\t\t\t\tthem; and so \"same,\" \"other\" and \"contrary\" must so vary, and so must\n\t\t\t\t\thave a separate meaning in accordance with each category.Things are called \"other in species\" (a)\n\t\t\t\t\twhich belong to the same genus and are not subordinate one to the\n\t\t\t\t\tother; or (b) which are in the same genus and\n\t\t\t\t\tcontain a differentia; or (c) which contain a contrariety in their\n\t\t\t\t\tessence.(d)\n\t\t\t\t\tContraries, too (either all of them or those which are called so in a\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary sense), are \"other in species\" than one another; and (e) so\n\t\t\t\t\tare all things of which the formulae are different in the final\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies of the genus (e.g., \"man\" and \"horse\" are generically\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible, but their formulae are different); and (f) attributes of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same substance which contain a difference. \"The same in species\"\n\t\t\t\t\thas the opposite meanings to these.\"Prior\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"posterior\" mean: (1.) (a) In one sense (assuming that there is in\n\t\t\t\t\teach genus some primary thing or starting-point) that which is nearer\n\t\t\t\t\tto some starting-point, determined either absolutely and naturally, or\n\t\t\t\t\trelatively, or locally, or by some agency; e.g., things are prior in\n\t\t\t\t\tspace because they are nearer either to some place naturally\n\t\t\t\t\tdetermined, such as the middle or the extreme, or to some chance\n\t\t\t\t\trelation; and that which is further is posterior.(b) In another sense, prior or\n\t\t\t\t\tposterior in  . Some things are prior as being\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther from the present, as in the case of past events (for the\n\t\t\t\t\tTrojan is prior to the Persian war, because it is further distant from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe present); and others as being nearer the present, as in the case\n\t\t\t\t\tof future events (for the Nemean are prior to the Pythian games\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they are nearer to the present, regarded as a starting-point\n\t\t\t\t\tand as primary).(c) In another sense, in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect of motion (for that which is nearer to the prime mover is\n\t\t\t\t\tprior; e.g., the boy is prior to the man). This too is a kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tstarting point in an absolute sense. (d) In respect of potency; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is superior in potency, or more potent, is prior. Such is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat in accordance with whose will the other, or posterior, thing must\n\t\t\t\t\tfollow, so that according as the former moves or does not move, the\n\t\t\t\t\tlatter is or is not moved. And the  is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\"starting-point.\"(e) In respect of order; such are all things which are\n\t\t\t\t\tsystematically arranged in relation to some one determinate object.\n\t\t\t\t\tE.g., he who is next to the leader of the chorus is prior to him who\n\t\t\t\t\tis next but one, and the seventh string is prior to the eighth; for in one case the leader is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe starting-point, and in the other the middle\n\t\t\t\t\tstring.In these examples \"prior\" has this sense; but\n\t\t\t\t\t(2.) in another sense that which is prior in knowledge is treated as\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely prior; and of things which are prior in this sense the\n\t\t\t\t\tprior in  are different from the prior in\n\t\t\t\t\t . Universals are prior in formula, but\n\t\t\t\t\tparticulars in perception. And in formula the attribute is prior to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe concrete whole: e.g. \"cultured\" to \"the cultured man\"; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tformula will not be a whole without the part.Yet \"cultured\" cannot exist apart from\n\t\t\t\t\tsome cultured person.Again, (3.)\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes of prior subjects are called prior; e.g., straightness is\n\t\t\t\t\tprior to smoothness, because the former is an\n\t\t\t\t\tattribute of the line in itself, and the latter of a\n\t\t\t\t\tsurface.Some things, then, are called prior and\n\t\t\t\t\tposterior in this sense; but others (iv.) in virtue of their nature\n\t\t\t\t\tand substance, namely all things which can exist apart from other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, whereas other things cannot exist without them. This\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinction was used by Plato.(And since \"being\" has\n\t\t\t\t\tvarious meanings, (a) the substrate, and therefore substance, is\n\t\t\t\t\tprior; (b) potential priority is different from actual\n\t\t\t\t\tpriority.Some\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are prior potentially, and some actually; e.g., potentially the\n\t\t\t\t\thalf-line is prior to the whole, or the part to the whole, or the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter to the substance; but actually it is posterior, because it is\n\t\t\t\t\tonly upon dissolution that it will actually exist.)Indeed, in a sense all things which are\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled \"prior\" or \"posterior\" are so called in this connection; for\n\t\t\t\t\tsome things can exist apart from others in generation (e.g. the whole\n\t\t\t\t\twithout the parts), and others in destruction (e.g. the parts without\n\t\t\t\t\tthe whole). And similarly with the other examples.\"Potency\" means: (a) the source of motion or\n\t\t\t\t\tchange which is in something other than the thing changed, or in it\n\t\t\t\t\t other. E.g., the science of building\n\t\t\t\t\tis a potency which is not present in the thing built; but the science\n\t\t\t\t\tof medicine, which is a potency, may be present in the patient,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough not  patient.Thus \"potency\" means the source in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral of change or motion in another thing, or in the same thing  other;or the source of a thing's being moved or changed\n\t\t\t\t\tby another thing, or by itself  other (for\n\t\t\t\t\tin virtue of that principle by which the passive thing is affected in\n\t\t\t\t\tany way we call it capable of being affected; sometimes if it is\n\t\t\t\t\taffected at all, and sometimes not in respect of every affection, but\n\t\t\t\t\tonly if it is changed for the better).(b) The power of performing this well or\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to intention; because sometimes we say that those who can\n\t\t\t\t\tmerely take a walk, or speak, without doing it as well as they\n\t\t\t\t\tintended, cannot speak or walk. And similarly in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tpassivity.(c) All\n\t\t\t\t\tstates in virtue of which things are unaffected generally, or are\n\t\t\t\t\tunchangeable, or cannot readily deteriorate, are called \"potencies.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tFor things are broken and worn out and bent and in general destroyed\n\t\t\t\t\tnot through potency but through impotence and deficiency of some sort;\n\t\t\t\t\tand things are unaffected by such processes which are scarcely or\n\t\t\t\t\tslightly affected because they have a potency and are potent and are\n\t\t\t\t\tin a definite state.Since \"potency\" has all these meanings,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"potent\" (or \"capable\") will mean (a) that which contains a source of\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion or change (for even what is static is \"potent\" in a sense)\n\t\t\t\t\twhich takes place in another thing, or in itself  other. (b) That over which something else has\n\t\t\t\t\ta potency of this kind. (c) That which has the potency of changing\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, either for the worse or for the better (for it seems that even\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which perishes is \"capable\" of perishing; otherwise, if it had\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen incapable, it would not have perished. As it is, it has a kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tdisposition or cause or principle which induces such an\n\t\t\t\t\taffection.Sometimes\n\t\t\t\t\tit seems to be such as it is because it  something,\n\t\t\t\t\tand sometimes because it is  of something; but if\n\t\t\t\t\tprivation is in a sense a state or \"habit,\" everything will be\n\t\t\t\t\t\"potent\" through  something; and so a thing is\n\t\t\t\t\t\"potent\" in virtue of having a certain \"habit\" or principle, and also\n\t\t\t\t\tin virtue of having the privation of that \"habit,\" if it can\n\t\t\t\t\t privation; and if privation is not in a sense\n\t\t\t\t\t\"habit,\" the term \"potent\" is equivocal).(d) A thing is \"potent\" if neither any other\n\t\t\t\t\tthing nor itself  other contains a potency\n\t\t\t\t\tor principle destructive of it. (e) All these things are \"potent\"\n\t\t\t\t\teither because they merely might chance to happen or not to happen, or\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they might do so  . Even in inanimate things\n\t\t\t\t\tthis kind of potency is found; e.g. in instruments; for they say that\n\t\t\t\t\tone lyre \"can\" be played, and another not at all, if it has not a good\n\t\t\t\t\ttone.\"Impotence\" is a privation of\n\t\t\t\t\tpotencya kind of abolition of the principle which has been\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribedeither in general or in something which would\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally possess that principle, or even at a time when it would\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally already possess it (for we should not use\n\t\t\t\t\t\"impotence\"in respect of begettingin the same\n\t\t\t\t\tsense of a boy, a man and a eunuch).Again, there is an \"impotence\" corresponding to\n\t\t\t\t\teach kind of potency; both to the kinetic and to the successfully\n\t\t\t\t\tkinetic.Some things are said to be \"impotent\"\n\t\t\t\t\tin accordance with this meaning of \"impotence,\" but others in a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent sense, namely \"possible\" and \"impossible.\" \"Impossible\"\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans: (a) that whose contrary is necessarily true; e.g., it is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible that the diagonal of a square should be commensurable with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sides, because such a thing is a lie, whose contrary is not only\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue but inevitable. Hence that it is commensurable is not only a lie\n\t\t\t\t\tbut necessarily a lie.And the contrary of the impossible, i.e. the possible, is when the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary is not necessarily a lie; e.g., it is possible that a man\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be seated, for it is not necessarily a lie that he should not\n\t\t\t\t\tbe seated. \"Possible,\" then, means in one sense, as we have said, that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is not necessarily a lie; in another, that which is true; and in\n\t\t\t\t\tanother, that which may be true.(The \"power\" in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeometry is so called by an extension of meaning.)These are the senses of \"potent\" which do\n\t\t\t\t\tnot correspond to \"potency.\" Those which do correspond to it all refer\n\t\t\t\t\tto the first meaning, i.e. \"a source of change which\n\t\t\t\t\texists in something other than that in which the change takes place,\n\t\t\t\t\tor in the same thing  other.\"Other things are said to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\"potent\" because something else has such\n\t\t\t\t\tapotency over them; others\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause it does not possess it; others because it possesses it in a\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular way. The term \"impotent\" is similarly used. Thus the\n\t\t\t\t\tauthoritative definition of \"potency\" in the primary sense will be \"a\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple producing change, which is in something other than that in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the change takes place, or in the same thing  other.\"\"Quantity\" means that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisible into constituent parts, each or every one\n\t\t\t\t\tof which is by nature some one individual thing. Thus plurality, if it\n\t\t\t\t\tis numerically calculable, is a kind of quantity; and so is magnitude,\n\t\t\t\t\tif it is measurable. \"Plurality\" means that which is potentially\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisible into non-continuous parts; and \"magnitude\" that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially divisible into continuous parts. Of kinds of magnitude,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is continuous in one direction is length; in two\n\t\t\t\t\tdirections, breadth; in three, depth.And of these, plurality, when limited, is a\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber; length, a line; breadth, a plane; depth, a body. Again, some\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are essentially quantitative, but others only accidentally;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g. the line is essentially, but \"cultured\" accidentally\n\t\t\t\t\tquantitative.And of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe former class some are quantitative in virtue of their substance,\n\t\t\t\t\te.g. the fine (because the definition which describes it is\n\t\t\t\t\tquantitative in some form);and others are attributes and conditions of a substance of this\n\t\t\t\t\tkind e.g., \"much\" and \"little,\" \"long\" and \"short,\" \"broad\"\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"narrow,\" \"deep\" and \"shallow,\" \"heavy\" and \"light,\"\n\t\t\t\t\tetc.Moreover,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"great\" and \"small,\" and \"greater\" and \"smaller,\" whether used\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely or relatively to one another, are essential attributes of\n\t\t\t\t\tquantity; by an extension of meaning, however, these terms are also\n\t\t\t\t\tapplied to other things.Of things called quantitative in an accidental sense, one kind is so\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled in the sense in which we said above that \"cultured\" or \"white\"\n\t\t\t\t\tis quantitativebecause the subject to which they belong is\n\t\t\t\t\tquantitative; and others in the sense that motion and time are so\n\t\t\t\t\tcalledfor these too are said in a sense to be quantitative\n\t\t\t\t\tand continuous, since the subjects of which they are attributes are\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisible. I mean, not the thing moved, but that through or along\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the motion has taken place; for it is because the latter is\n\t\t\t\t\tquantitative that the motion is quantitative, and because the motion\n\t\t\t\t\tis quantitative that the time is also.\"Quality\" means\n\t\t\t\t\t(a) in one sense, the differentia of essence; e.g., a man is an animal\n\t\t\t\t\tof a certain quality because he is two-footed; and so is a horse,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause it is four-footed. Also a circle is a geometrical figure of a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain quality, because it has no angles; which\n\t\t\t\t\tshows that the essential differentia is quality.In this one sense, then, \"quality\"\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans differentia of essence; but (b) in another it is used as of\n\t\t\t\t\timmovable and mathematical objects, in the sense that numbers are in a\n\t\t\t\t\tway qualitativee.g. such as are composite and are\n\t\t\t\t\trepresented geometrically not by a line but by a plane or solid (these\n\t\t\t\t\tare products respectively of two and of three factors)and\n\t\t\t\t\tin general means that which is present besides quantity in the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence. For the essence of each number is that which goes into it\n\t\t\t\t\tonce; e.g. that of 6 is not what goes twice or three times, but what\n\t\t\t\t\tgoes once; for 6 is once 6.(c) All affections of substance in motion in respect of which bodies\n\t\t\t\t\tbecome different when they (the affections) changee.g. heat\n\t\t\t\t\tand cold, whiteness and blackness, heaviness and lightness, etc. (d)\n\t\t\t\t\tThe term is used with reference to goodness and badness, and in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral to good and bad.Thus there are, roughly\n\t\t\t\t\tspeaking, two meanings which the term \"quality\" can bear, and of these\n\t\t\t\t\tone is more fundamental than the other. Quality in the primary sense\n\t\t\t\t\tis the differentia of the essence; and quality in numbers falls under\n\t\t\t\t\tthis sense, because it is a kind of differentia of essences, but of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings either not in motion or not  in\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion. Secondly, there are the affections of things in motion  in motion, and the differentiae of\n\t\t\t\t\tmotions.Goodness\n\t\t\t\t\tand badness fall under these affections,because they denote differentiae of the motion or\n\t\t\t\t\tfunctioning in respect of which things in motion act or are acted upon\n\t\t\t\t\twell or badly. For that which can function or be moved in\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch-and-such a way is good, and that which can function in\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch-and-such a way and in the contrary way is bad. Quality refers\n\t\t\t\t\tespecially to \"good\" and \"bad\" in the case of living things, and of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese especially in the case of such as possess choice.Things are called \"relative\" (a) In the sense that \"the double\" is\n\t\t\t\t\trelative to the half, and \"the triple\" to the third; and in general\n\t\t\t\t\tthe \"many times greater\" to the \"many times smaller,\" and that which\n\t\t\t\t\texceeds to the thing exceeded. (b) In the sense that the thing which\n\t\t\t\t\theats or cuts is relative to the thing heated or cut; and in general\n\t\t\t\t\tthe active to the passive. (c) In the sense that the measurable is\n\t\t\t\t\trelative to the measure, and the knowable to knowledge, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible to sensation.(a) In the first sense they\n\t\t\t\t\tare said to be numerically relative; either simply, or in a definite\n\t\t\t\t\trelation to numbers or to 1. E.g., \"the double\" in relation to 1 is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinite number; the \"many times as great\" is in a numerical relation\n\t\t\t\t\tto 1, but not in a definite relation such as  or\n\t\t\t\t\t ; the relation of that which is 1.5 times\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else to that something is a definite numerical relation to a\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber; and that which is (n+1)/n times something else is in an\n\t\t\t\t\tindefinite relation to a number, just as \"the many times as great\" is\n\t\t\t\t\tin an indefinite relation to 1.The relation of that which exceeds to that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is exceeded is numerically quite indefinite, for number is\n\t\t\t\t\tcommensurate, and is not predicated of the incommensurate; whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which exceeds, in relation to that which is exceeded, is \"so\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch\" plus something more; and this something more is indefinite, for\n\t\t\t\t\tit is indifferently equal or not equal to the \"so much.\"Thus not only are all these\n\t\t\t\t\tthings said to be relative in respect of number, but also the \"equal\"\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"like\" and \"same,\" though in another way: for all these terms are\n\t\t\t\t\tused in respect of \"one\". Things are \"the same\" whose essence is one;\n\t\t\t\t\t\"like\" whose quality is one; \"equal\" whose quantity is one. Now \"one\"\n\t\t\t\t\tis the starting-point and standard of number; and so all these\n\t\t\t\t\trelations involve number, though not all in the same way.(b) Active and passive things are called relative in virtue of an\n\t\t\t\t\tactive or passive potentiality or actualization of the potentialities;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g., that which can heat is called relative to that which can be\n\t\t\t\t\theated, because it can heat; and again the thing heating is called\n\t\t\t\t\trelative to the thing heated, and the thing cutting to the thing cut,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause their potentialities are actualized. Numerical relations, on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other hand, are not actualized(except as has been described elsewhere); they\n\t\t\t\t\thave no actualizations in respect of motion.Of things potentially relative, some are\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther relative in respect of particular times; as, e.g., that which\n\t\t\t\t\thas made or will make is relative to that which has been or will be\n\t\t\t\t\tmade. It is in this way that a father is called father of a son; the\n\t\t\t\t\tone has acted, and the other has been acted upon, in a particular way.\n\t\t\t\t\tAgain, some things are relative in virtue of a privation of their\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality; such is \"the impossible\" and all similar terms, e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\t\"the invisible.\"Thus relative terms which involve\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber and potentiality are all relative because their very essence\n\t\t\t\t\tcontains a reference to something else; but not because something else\n\t\t\t\t\tis related to their essence. But (c) that which is measurable or\n\t\t\t\t\tknowable or thinkable is called relative because something else is\n\t\t\t\t\trelated to its essence.For \"thinkable\" signifies that there is a thought which thinks it;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut thought is not relative to that of which it is the thought (for\n\t\t\t\t\tthen the same thing would have been said twice). And similarly sight\n\t\t\t\t\tis the sight of something; not of that of which it is the sight,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough this is of course trueit is relative to some color\n\t\t\t\t\tor other similar thing.To describe it in the other way\"the sight of the object\n\t\t\t\t\tof sight\"would be to say the same thing twice. Things, then, which are called relative of their\n\t\t\t\t\town nature are so called, some in these senses, and others because the\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses which contain them are of this kind. E.g., medicine is\n\t\t\t\t\treckoned as relative because its genus, science, is thought to be a\n\t\t\t\t\trelative thing.Further,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are the properties in virtue of which the things which possess\n\t\t\t\t\tthem are called relative; e.g., \"equality\" is relative because \"the\n\t\t\t\t\tequal\" is relative, and \"similarity\" because \"the similar\" is\n\t\t\t\t\trelative. Other things are accidentally relative; e.g., a man is\n\t\t\t\t\trelative because he happens to be \"double\" something else, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"double\" is a relative term; or \"white\" is relative if the same thing\n\t\t\t\t\thappens to be white as well as double.\"Perfect\"\n\t\t\t\t\t<or \"complete\"> means: (a) That outside which it is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible to find even a single one of its parts; e.g., the complete\n\t\t\t\t\ttime of each thing is that outside which it is impossible to find any\n\t\t\t\t\ttime which is a part of it. (b) That which, in respect of goodness or\n\t\t\t\t\texcellence, cannot be surpassed in its kind; e.g., a doctor and a\n\t\t\t\t\tmusician are \"perfect\" when they have no deficiency in respect of the\n\t\t\t\t\tform of their peculiar excellence.And thus by an extension of the meaning we use\n\t\t\t\t\tthe term in a bad connection, and speak of a \"perfect\" humbug and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\"perfect\" thief; since indeed we call them \"good\"e.g. a \"good\" thief and a \"good\"\n\t\t\t\t\thumbug.(c) And\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness is a kind of perfection. For each thing, and every substance,\n\t\t\t\t\tis perfect when, and only when, in respect of the form of its peculiar\n\t\t\t\t\texcellence, it lacks no particle of its natural magnitude. (d) Things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich have attained their end, if their end is good, are called\n\t\t\t\t\t\"perfect\"; for they are perfect in virtue of having attained the\n\t\t\t\t\tend.Hence, since\n\t\t\t\t\tthe end is an ultimate thing, we extend the meaning of the term to bad\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses, and speak of perishing \"perfectly\" or being \"perfectly\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed, when the destruction or calamity falls short in no respect\n\t\t\t\t\tbut reaches its extremity. Hence, by an extension of the meaning,\n\t\t\t\t\tdeath is called an \"end,\" because they are both ultimate things. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ultimate object of action is also an end.Things, then, which are called \"perfect\" in themselves are so called\n\t\t\t\t\tin all these senses; either because in respect of excellence they have\n\t\t\t\t\tno deficiency and cannot be surpassed, and because no part of them can\n\t\t\t\t\tbe found outside them; or because, in general, they are unsurpassed in\n\t\t\t\t\teach particular class, and have no part outside. All\n\t\t\t\t\tother things are so called in virtue of these, because they either\n\t\t\t\t\tproduce or possess something of this kind, or conform to it, or are\n\t\t\t\t\treferred in some way or other to things which are perfect in the\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary sense.\"Limit\" means: (a) The furthest part of\n\t\t\t\t\teach thing, and the first point outside which no part of a thing can\n\t\t\t\t\tbe found, and the first point within which all parts are contained.\n\t\t\t\t\t(b) Any form of magnitude or of something possessing\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnitude.(c) The\n\t\t\t\t\tend of each thing. (This end is that  which motion and\n\t\t\t\t\taction proceed, and not the end  which. But sometimes\n\t\t\t\t\tit is both the end from which and the end to which, i.e. the final\n\t\t\t\t\tcause.) (d) The reality or essence of each thing; for this is the\n\t\t\t\t\tlimit of our knowledge of it, and if it is a limit of the knowledge,\n\t\t\t\t\tit is also a limit of the thing. Thus it is obvious that \"limit\" has\n\t\t\t\t\tnot only as many senses as \"beginning\" but even more; because the\n\t\t\t\t\tbeginning is a kind of limit, but not every limit is a\n\t\t\t\t\tbeginning.\"That in virtue of which\" has various\n\t\t\t\t\tmeanings. (a) The form or essence of each individual thing; e.g., that\n\t\t\t\t\tin virtue of which a man is good is \"goodness itself.\" (b) The\n\t\t\t\t\timmediate substrate in which a thing is naturally produced; as, e.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tcolor is produced in the surface of things. Thus \"that in virtue of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich\" in the primary sense is the  , and in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsecondary sense, as it were, the  of each thing,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the immediate substrate.And in general \"that in virtue of which\" will\n\t\t\t\t\texist in the same number of senses as \"cause.\"For we say indifferently \"in virtue of\n\t\t\t\t\twhat has he come?\" or \"for what reason has he come?\" and \"in virtue of\n\t\t\t\t\twhat has he inferred or inferred falsely?\" or \"what is the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\this inference or false inference?\" (And further, there is the\n\t\t\t\t\tpositional sense of , \"in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich he stands,\" or \"in which he walks\"; all these examples denote\n\t\t\t\t\tplace or position.)Hence \"in virtue of itself\" must also\n\t\t\t\t\thave various meanings. It denotes (a) The essence of each particular;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g., Callias is in virtue of himself Callias and the essence of\n\t\t\t\t\tCallias. (b) Everything contained in the definition; e.g., Callias is\n\t\t\t\t\tin virtue of himself an animal, because \"animal\" is present in the\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition, since Callias is a kind of animal.(c) Any attribute which a thing has\n\t\t\t\t\treceived directly in itself or in any of its parts; e.g., the surface\n\t\t\t\t\tis white in virtue of itself; and man lives in virtue of himself,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the soul is a part of the man, and life is directly contained\n\t\t\t\t\tin it. (d) That which has no other cause. Man has many causes:\n\t\t\t\t\t\"animal,\" \"twofooted,\" etc.; but nevertheless man is in virtue of\n\t\t\t\t\thimself man. (e) All things which belong to a thing alone and  alone; and hence that which is separate\n\t\t\t\t\tis \"in virtue of itself.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Disposition\" means arrangement of that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich has parts, either in space or in potentiality or in form. It\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be a kind of position, as indeed is clear from the word,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"disposition.\"\"Having\"\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans (a) In one sense an activity, as it were, of the haver and the\n\t\t\t\t\tthing had, or as in the case of an action or motion; for when one\n\t\t\t\t\tthing makes and another is made, there is between them an act of\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking. In this way between the man who has a garment and the garment\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is had, there is a \"having.\" Clearly, then, it is impossible to\n\t\t\t\t\t a \"having\" in this sense; for there will be an\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite series if we can have the having of what we have.But (b) there is another sense\n\t\t\t\t\tof \"having\" which means a disposition, in virtue of which the thing\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is disposed is disposed well or badly, and either independently\n\t\t\t\t\tor in relation to something else. E.g., health is a state, since it is\n\t\t\t\t\ta disposition of the kind described. Further, any part of such a\n\t\t\t\t\tdisposition is called a state; and hence the excellence of the parts\n\t\t\t\t\tis a kind of state.\"Affection\" means (a) In one sense, a\n\t\t\t\t\tquality in virtue of which alteration is possible; e.g., whiteness and\n\t\t\t\t\tblackness, sweetness and bitterness, heaviness and lightness, etc. (b)\n\t\t\t\t\tThe actualizations of these qualities; i.e. the alterations already\n\t\t\t\t\trealized. (c) More particularly, hurtful alterations and\n\t\t\t\t\tmotions,and\n\t\t\t\t\tespecially hurts which cause suffering. (d) Extreme cases of\n\t\t\t\t\tmisfortune and suffering are called \"affections.\"We speak of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"privation\": (a) In one sense, if a thing does not possess an\n\t\t\t\t\tattribute which is a natural possession, even if the thing itself\n\t\t\t\t\twould not naturally possess it; e.g., we\n\t\t\t\t\tsay that a vegetable is \"deprived\" of eyes. (b) If a thing does not\n\t\t\t\t\tpossess an attribute which it or its genus would naturally possess.\n\t\t\t\t\tE.g., a blind man is not \"deprived\" of sight in the same sense that a\n\t\t\t\t\tmole is; the latter is \"deprived\" in virtue of its genus, but the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer in virtue of himself.(c) If\n\t\t\t\t\ta thing has not an attribute which it would naturally possess, and\n\t\t\t\t\twhen it would naturally possess it (for blindness is a form of\n\t\t\t\t\tprivation; but a man is not blind at  age, but only if\n\t\t\t\t\the lacks sight at the age when he would naturally possess it), and similarly if it lacks an attribute in the medium and organ\n\t\t\t\t\tand relation and manner in which it would naturally possess\n\t\t\t\t\tit.(d) The forcible\n\t\t\t\t\tremoval of anything is called privation. (e) Privation has as many\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses as there are senses of negation derived from the negative affix\n\t\t\t\t\t(-). For we call a thing\n\t\t\t\t\t\"unequal\" because it does not possess equality (though it would\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally do so); and \"invisible\" either because it has no color at\n\t\t\t\t\tall or because it has only a faint one; and \"footless\" either because\n\t\t\t\t\tit has no feet at all or because it has rudimentary feet.Again, a negative affix may\n\t\t\t\t\tmean \"having something in a small degree\"e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\t\"stoneless\" that is, having it in some\n\t\t\t\t\trudimentary manner. Again, it may mean having it \"not easily\" or \"not\n\t\t\t\t\twell\"; e.g., \"uncutable\" means not only that which cannot be cut, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which cannot be cut easily or well. And again, it may mean not\n\t\t\t\t\thaving a thing at all; for it is not the one-eyed man, but the man who\n\t\t\t\t\tlacks sight in both eyes, who is called blind. Hence not every man is\n\t\t\t\t\tgood or bad, moral or immoral; there is also the intermediate\n\t\t\t\t\tstate.\"To have\" <or \"possess\"> is used\n\t\t\t\t\tin various senses. (a) To direct in accordance with one's own nature\n\t\t\t\t\tor impulse; whence we say that fever \"possesses\" a man, and despots\n\t\t\t\t\t\"possess\" cities, and people who wear clothes \"possess\" them. (b) We\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak of anything as \"having\" in which, as receptive material,\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething is present. E.g., the bronze \"has\" the shape of the statue,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the body \"has\" the disease.(c) In the sense that the container holds the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontained; for when A is contained in B, we say that A is held by B.\n\t\t\t\t\tE.g., we say that the vessel holds the liquid, and the city holds men,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the ship holds sailors, and so too that the whole \"holds\" the\n\t\t\t\t\tparts.(d) The same\n\t\t\t\t\tterm is applied to that which prevents anything from moving or acting\n\t\t\t\t\tin accordance with its own impulse; as pillars hold <up>\n\t\t\t\t\tthe weights which are imposed upon them,and as the poets make Atlas hold up the heaven, because otherwise it\n\t\t\t\t\twould fall upon the earth (as some of the physicists maintain also). It is in this sense that\n\t\t\t\t\twe say that \"that which holds together\" holds what it holds together;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause otherwise the latter would disperse, each part in accordance\n\t\t\t\t\twith its own impulse.\"To be in a thing\"\n\t\t\t\t\tis used similarly in senses corresponding to those of \"to\n\t\t\t\t\thave.\"\"To come from something\" means: (a) In one\n\t\t\t\t\tsense, to come from something as matter, and this in two ways: in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect either of the primary genus or of the ultimate species. E.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tin the one sense everything liquefiable comes from water, and in the\n\t\t\t\t\tother the statue comes from bronze.(b) To come from something as the first moving\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple; e.g., \"from what comes fighting?\" From abuse; because this\n\t\t\t\t\tis the beginning of a fight. (c) To come from the combination of\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter and form (as the parts come from the whole, and the verse from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe , and the stones from the house); for the shape is an end, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is a complete thing which has attained its end.(d) In the sense that the form\n\t\t\t\t\tis made out of the part of its definition; as, e.g., \"man\" is made out\n\t\t\t\t\tof \"two-footed \" and the syllable out of its element(this is a different way\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom that in which the statue is made out of the bronze; for the composite entity is made out of perceptible\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterial, but the form is also made out of the material of the\n\t\t\t\t\tform).These, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tare some of the meanings of \"from\" <or \"out of\">, but\n\t\t\t\t\t(e) sometimes one of these senses only partially applies; e.g., the\n\t\t\t\t\tchild comes from the father and mother, and plants from the earth,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they come from some part of those things. (f) It means \"after\"\n\t\t\t\t\tin time; e.g., we say that night comes from day, and storm from fine\n\t\t\t\t\tweather, because one comes after the other.And we speak thus of some of these things in\n\t\t\t\t\tview of their alternation with each other, as in the examples just\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned, and of others in view merely of their succession in time;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g., \"the voyage was made from the equinox,\" meaning that it was made\n\t\t\t\t\tafter it; and \"the Thargelia are from the Dionysia,\" meaning after the\n\t\t\t\t\tDionysia.\"Part\" means: (a) That into which a quantity can be in any way\n\t\t\t\t\tdivided; for that which is taken from a quantity  quantity is always called a part of that\n\t\t\t\t\tquantitye.g., we call 2 part (in a sense) of 3. (b) In\n\t\t\t\t\tanother sense the term is only applied to those \"parts\" in sense (a)\n\t\t\t\t\twhich measure the whole; hence in one sense we call 2 part of 3, and\n\t\t\t\t\tin another not.Again, (c)\n\t\t\t\t\tthose divisions into which the form, apart from quantity, can be\n\t\t\t\t\tdivided, are also called parts of the form. Hence species are called\n\t\t\t\t\tparts of their genus. (d) That into which the whole(either the form or that which contains\n\t\t\t\t\tthe form) is divided, or of which it is composed. E.g., of a bronze\n\t\t\t\t\tsphere or cube not only is the bronze(i.e. the material which contains the form) a\n\t\t\t\t\tpart, but also the angle. (e) The elements in the definition of each\n\t\t\t\t\tthing are also called parts of the whole. Hence the genus is even\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled a part of the species, whereas in another sense the species is\n\t\t\t\t\tpart of the genus.\"Whole\" means: (a) That from which no\n\t\t\t\t\tpart is lacking of those things as composed of which it is called a\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural whole. (b) That which so contains its contents that they form\n\t\t\t\t\ta unity; and this in two ways, either in the sense that each of them\n\t\t\t\t\tis a unity, or in the sense that the unity is composed of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem.For (i) the\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal, or term generally applied as being some whole thing, is\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal in the sense that it contains many particulars; because it\n\t\t\t\t\tis predicated of each of them, and each and all of them (e.g. man,\n\t\t\t\t\thorse, god) are one; because they are all living things. And (2) that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is continuous and limited is a whole when it is a unity composed\n\t\t\t\t\tof several parts (especially if the parts are only potentially present\n\t\t\t\t\tin it; but otherwise even if they are present actually).And of these things\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, those which are so naturally are more truly wholes than\n\t\t\t\t\tthose which are so artificially; just as we said of \"the one,\" because\n\t\t\t\t\t\"wholeness\" is a kind of \"oneness.\" Again,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince a quantity has a beginning, middle and end, those to which\n\t\t\t\t\tposition makes no difference we describe as \"all,\" and those to which\n\t\t\t\t\tposition makes a difference we describe as \"whole,\" and those to which\n\t\t\t\t\tboth descriptions can be applied, as both \"all\" and \"whole.\"These are all things whose\n\t\t\t\t\tnature remains the same in transposition, but whose shape does not;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g. wax or a coat. They are described as both \"whole\" and \"all\"; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthey have both characteristics. Water, however, and all liquids, and\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber, are described as \"all\"; we do not speak of a \"whole number\" or\n\t\t\t\t\t\"whole water\" except by an extension of meaning. Things are described\n\t\t\t\t\tas \"all\" in the plural  differentiated which\n\t\t\t\t\tare described as \"all\" in the singular  one;\n\t\t\t\t\tall this number, all these units.We do not\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribe any chance quantity as \"mutilated\"; it must have parts, and\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be a whole. The number 2 is not mutilated if one of its 1's is\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken awaybecause the part lost by mutilation is never\n\t\t\t\t\tequal to the remaindernor in general is any number\n\t\t\t\t\tmutilated; because the essence must persist. If a cup is mutilated, it\n\t\t\t\t\tmust still be a cup; but the number is no longer the same.Moreover, not even all things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich have dissimilar parts are mutilated; for a number has in a sense\n\t\t\t\t\tdissimilar as well as similar partse.g. 2, 3. But in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral of things whose position makes no difference, e.g. water or\n\t\t\t\t\tfire, none is mutilated;to be mutilated, things must be such as have their\n\t\t\t\t\tposition according to their essence.Further, they must be continuous; for a\n\t\t\t\t\tmusical scale is composed of dissimilar parts, and has position; but\n\t\t\t\t\tit does not become mutilated. Moreover, even things which are wholes\n\t\t\t\t\tare not mutilated by the removal of  of their parts;\n\t\t\t\t\tthe parts removed must be neither proper to their essence nor in any\n\t\t\t\t\tchance location. E.g., a cup is not mutilated if a hole is made in it,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut only if the handle or some projection is broken;and a man is not mutilated if\n\t\t\t\t\the loses flesh or his spleen, but if he loses some extremity; and not\n\t\t\t\t\tevery extremity, but only such as cannot grow again when completely\n\t\t\t\t\tremoved. Hence bald people are not mutilated.The\n\t\t\t\t\tterm \"genus\" <or \"race\"> is used: (a) When there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinuous generation of things of the same type; e.g., \"as long as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe human  exists\" means \"as long as the generation\n\t\t\t\t\tof human beings is continuous.\" (b) Of anything from which things\n\t\t\t\t\tderive their being as the prime mover of them into being. Thus some\n\t\t\t\t\tare called Hellenes by race, and others Ionians, because some have\n\t\t\t\t\tHellen and others Ion\n\t\t\t\t\tas their first ancestor.(Races are called after the male ancestor rather than after the\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterial.\n\t\t\t\t\tSome derive their race from the female as well; e.g. \"the descendants\n\t\t\t\t\tof Pyrrha.\") (c) In the sense\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the plane is the \"genus\" of plane figures, and the solid of\n\t\t\t\t\tsolids (for each one of the figures is either a particular plane or a\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular solid); i.e., that which underlies the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiae.(d) In\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sense that in formulae the first component, which is stated as\n\t\t\t\t\tpart of the essence, is the genus, and the qualities are said to be\n\t\t\t\t\tits differentiae. The term \"genus,\" then, is used in all these\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses(a) in respect of continuous generation of the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttype; (b) in respect of the first mover of the same type as the things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it moves; (c) in the sense of material. For that to which the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentia or quality belongs is the substrate, which we call\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterial.Things are called \"generically\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent\" whose immediate substrates are different and cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\tresolved one into the other or both into the same thing. E.g., form\n\t\t\t\t\tand matter are generically different, and all things which belong to\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent categories of being; for some of the things of which being\n\t\t\t\t\tis predicated denote the essence, others a quality, and others the\n\t\t\t\t\tvarious other things which have already been distinguished. For these\n\t\t\t\t\talso cannot be resolved either into each other or into any one\n\t\t\t\t\tthing.\"False\" means: (i) false as a\n\t\t\t\t\t ; (a) because it is not or cannot be substantiated;\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch are the statements that the diagonal of a square is\n\t\t\t\t\tcommensurable,or that\n\t\t\t\t\tyou are sitting. Of these one is false always, and the other\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes; it is in these senses that these things are not\n\t\t\t\t\tfacts.(b) Such\n\t\t\t\t\tthings as really exist, but whose nature it is to seem either such as\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are not, or like things which are unreal; e.g. chiaroscuro and\n\t\t\t\t\tdreams. For these are really something, but not that of which they\n\t\t\t\t\tcreate the impression. Things, then, are called false in these senses:\n\t\t\t\t\teither because they themselves are unreal, or because the impression\n\t\t\t\t\tderived from them is that of something unreal.(2.) A\n\t\t\t\t\tfalse statement is the statement of , in so\n\t\t\t\t\tfar as the statement is false. Hence every definition is untrue of\n\t\t\t\t\tanything other than that of which it is true; e.g., the definition of\n\t\t\t\t\ta circle is untrue of a triangle. Now in one sense there is only one\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition of each thing, namely that of its essence; but in another\n\t\t\t\t\tsense there are many definitions, since the thing itself, and the thing itself\n\t\t\t\t\tqualified (e.g. \"Socrates\"\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"cultured Socrates\") are\n\t\t\t\t\tin a sense the same.But\n\t\t\t\t\tthe false definition is not strictly a definition of anything. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tit was foolish of Antisthenes to insist that nothing can be\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribed except by its proper definition: one predicate for one\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject; from which it followed that contradiction is impossible, and\n\t\t\t\t\tfalsehood nearly\n\t\t\t\t\tso. But it is possible to describe everything not only by its own\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition but by that of something else; quite falsely, and yet also\n\t\t\t\t\tin a sense trulye.g., 8 may be described as \"double\" by the\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition of 2. Such are the\n\t\t\t\t\tmeanings of \"false\" in these cases. (3.) A false man is one who\n\t\t\t\t\treadily and deliberately makes such statements, for the sake of doing\n\t\t\t\t\tso and for no other reason; and one who induces such statements in\n\t\t\t\t\tothersjust as we call things false which induce a false\n\t\t\t\t\timpression. Hence the proof in the  that the same man is false and true\n\t\t\t\t\tis misleading;for it\n\t\t\t\t\tassumes (a) that the false man is he who is  to\n\t\t\t\t\tdeceive, i.e. the man who knows and is intelligent; (b) that the man\n\t\t\t\t\twho is willingly bad is better. This false assumption is due to the\n\t\t\t\t\tinduction; for when he says that the man who limps willingly is better\n\t\t\t\t\tthan he who does so unwillingly, he means by limping\n\t\t\t\t\t to limp. For if he is willingly lame, he is\n\t\t\t\t\tpresumably worse in this case just as he is in the case of moral\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter.\"Accident\" <or\n\t\t\t\t\t\"attribute\"> means that which applies to something and is truly\n\t\t\t\t\tstated, but neither necessarily nor usually; as if, for example, while\n\t\t\t\t\tdigging a hole for a plant one found a treasure. Then the finding of\n\t\t\t\t\ttreasure is an accident to the man who is digging the hole; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tone thing is not a necessary consequence or sequel of the other, nor\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes one usually find treasure while planting.And a cultured man might be white; but since\n\t\t\t\t\tthis does not happen necessarily or usually, we call it an accident.\n\t\t\t\t\tThus since there are attributes and subjects, and some attributes\n\t\t\t\t\tapply to their subjects only at a certain place and time, any\n\t\t\t\t\tattribute which applies to a subject, but not because it was a\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular subject or time or place, will be an accident.Nor is there any definite\n\t\t\t\t\tcause for an accident, but only a chance, i.e. indefinite, cause. It\n\t\t\t\t\twas by accident that X went to  if he arrived there, not because he intended to go\n\t\t\t\t\tthere but because he was carried out of his course by a storm, or\n\t\t\t\t\tcaptured by pirates.The\n\t\t\t\t\taccident has happened or exists, but in virtue not of itself but of\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else; for it was the storm which was the cause of his coming\n\t\t\t\t\tto a place for which he was not sailingi.e. .\"Accident\" has also another sense, namely,\n\t\t\t\t\twhatever belongs to each thing in virtue of itself, but is not in its\n\t\t\t\t\tessence; e.g. as having the sum of its angles equal to two right\n\t\t\t\t\tangles belongs to the triangle. Accidents of this kind may be eternal,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut none of the former kind can be.

There is a\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of health and physical fitness; and mathematics has principles\n\t\t\t\t\tand elements and causes; and in general every intellectual science or\n\t\t\t\t\tscience which involves intellect deals with causes and principles,\n\t\t\t\t\tmore or less exactly or simply considered.But all these sciences single out some\n\t\t\t\t\texistent thing or class, and concern themselves with that; not with\n\t\t\t\t\tBeing unqualified, nor  Being, nor do they\n\t\t\t\t\tgive any account of the essence; but starting from it, some making it\n\t\t\t\t\tclear to perception, and others assuming it as a hypothesis, they\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstrate, more or less cogently, the essential attributes of the\n\t\t\t\t\tclass with which they are dealing.Hence obviously there is no demonstration of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance or essence from this method of approach, but some other\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans of exhibiting it. And similarly they say nothing as to whether\n\t\t\t\t\tthe class of objects with which they are concerned exists or not;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the demonstration of its essence and that of its existence\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to the same intellectual process.And since physical science also happens to\n\t\t\t\t\tdeal with a genus of Being(for it deals with the sort of substance which contains in itself\n\t\t\t\t\tthe principle of motion and rest), obviously it is neither a practical\n\t\t\t\t\tnor a productive science.For in the case of things produced the principle of motion (either\n\t\t\t\t\tmind or art or some kind of potency) is in the producer; and in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase of things done the will is the agentfor the thing done\n\t\t\t\t\tand the thing willed are the same. Thus if every intellectual activity\n\t\t\t\t\tis either practical or productive or speculative, physics will be a\n\t\t\t\t\tspeculative science; but speculative about that kind of Being which\n\t\t\t\t\tcan be moved, and about formulated substance for the most part only\n\t\t\t\t\t inseparable from matter.But we must not fail to observe\n\t\t\t\t\t the essence and the formula exist, since\n\t\t\t\t\twithout this our inquiry is ineffectual.Now of things defined, i.e. of essences, some apply in the sense\n\t\t\t\t\tthat \"snub\" does, and some in the sense that \"concave\" does. The\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference is that \"snub\" is a combination of form with matter;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the \"snub\" is a concave  , whereas concavity\n\t\t\t\t\tis independent of sensible matter. Now if all physical terms are used in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same sense as \"snub\"e.g. nose, eye, face, flesh, bone,\n\t\t\t\t\tand in general animal; leaf, root, bark, and in general vegetable (for\n\t\t\t\t\tnot one of these has a definition without motion; the definition\n\t\t\t\t\tinvariably includes matter)it is clear how we should look\n\t\t\t\t\tfor and define the essence in physical things, and why it is the\n\t\t\t\t\tprovince of the physicist to study even some aspects of the soul, so\n\t\t\t\t\tfar as it is not independent of matter.It is obvious,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, from these considerations, that physics is a form of speculative\n\t\t\t\t\tscience. And mathematics is also speculative; but it is not clear at\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent whether its objects are immutable and separable from matter;\n\t\t\t\t\tit is clear, however, that some branches of mathematics study their\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects  immutable and  separable from matter. Obviously it is the province of a\n\t\t\t\t\tspeculative science to discover whether a thing is eternal and\n\t\t\t\t\timmutable and separable from matter;not, however, of physics (since physics deals\n\t\t\t\t\twith mutable objects) nor of mathematics, but of a science prior to\n\t\t\t\t\tboth. For physics deals with things which exist separately but are not\n\t\t\t\t\timmutable; and some branches of mathematics deal with things which are\n\t\t\t\t\timmutable, but presumably not separable, but present in matter; but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe primary science treats of things which are both separable and\n\t\t\t\t\timmutable.Now all\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses must be eternal, but these especially; since they are the\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses of what is visible of things divine. Hence there will be three\n\t\t\t\t\tspeculative philosophies: mathematics, physics, and\n\t\t\t\t\ttheologysince it is obvious that if the divine is present anywhere, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent in this kind of entity; and also the most honorable science\n\t\t\t\t\tmust deal with the most honorable class of subject.The\n\t\t\t\t\tspeculative sciences, then, are to be preferred to the other sciences,\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"theology\" to the other speculative sciences. One might indeed\n\t\t\t\t\traise the question whether the primary philosophy is universal or\n\t\t\t\t\tdeals with some one genus or entity; because even the mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tsciences differ in this respectgeometry and astronomy deal\n\t\t\t\t\twith a particular kind of entity, whereas universal mathematics\n\t\t\t\t\tapplies to all kinds alike.Then if there is not some other substance besides those which are\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally composed, physics will be the primary science; but if there\n\t\t\t\t\tis a substance which is immutable, the science which studies this will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe prior to physics, and will be primary philosophy, and universal in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis sense, that it is primary. And it will be the province of this\n\t\t\t\t\tscience to study Being  Being; what it is,\n\t\t\t\t\tand what the attributes are which belong to it  Being.But since the simple term \"being\" is\n\t\t\t\t\tused in various senses, of which we saw that one was\n\t\t\t\t\t , and another  (not-being\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing used in the sense of \"false\"); and since besides these there are\n\t\t\t\t\tthe categories, e.g. the \"what,\" quality, quantity, place, time, and\n\t\t\t\t\tany other similar meanings; and further besides\n\t\t\t\t\tall these the  and  : since\n\t\t\t\t\tthe term \"being\" has various senses, it must first be said of what\n\t\t\t\t\t\"is\" accidentally, that there can be no speculation about\n\t\t\t\t\tit.This is shown by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe fact that no science, whether practical, productive or\n\t\t\t\t\tspeculative, concerns itself with it. The man who produces a house\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not produce all the attributes which are accidental to the house\n\t\t\t\t\tin its construction; for they are infinite in number. There is no\n\t\t\t\t\treason why the house so produced should not be agreeable to some,\n\t\t\t\t\tinjurious to others, and beneficial to others, and different perhaps\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom every other existing thing; but the act of building is productive\n\t\t\t\t\tof none of these results.In the same way the geometrician does not study the accidental\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes of his figures, nor whether a triangle is different from a\n\t\t\t\t\ttriangle the sum of whose angles is equal to two right angles. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthis accords with what we should reasonably expect, because \"accident\"\n\t\t\t\t\tis only, as it were, a sort of name. Hence in a way Plato was not far wrong in making sophistry\n\t\t\t\t\tdeal with what is nonexistent;because the sophists discuss the accident\n\t\t\t\t\tmore, perhaps, than any other peoplewhether \"cultured\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"grammatical,\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"cultured Coriscus\" and \"Coriscus,\" are\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same or different; and whether everything that is, but has not\n\t\t\t\t\talways been, has come into being, so that if a man who is cultured has\n\t\t\t\t\tbecome grammatical,he has\n\t\t\t\t\talso, being grammatical, become cultured; and all other\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch discussions. Indeed it seems that the accidental is something\n\t\t\t\t\tclosely akin to the nonexistent.This is clear too from such considerations as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe following: of things which  in other senses there\n\t\t\t\t\tis generation and destruction, but of things which \n\t\t\t\t\taccidentally there is not. Nevertheless we must\n\t\t\t\t\tstate further, so far as it is possible, with regard to the\n\t\t\t\t\taccidental, what its nature is and through what cause it exists. At\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same time it will doubtless also appear why there is no science of\n\t\t\t\t\tit.Since, then, there are among existing things\n\t\t\t\t\tsome which are invariable and of necessity (not necessity in the sense\n\t\t\t\t\tof compulsion, but that by which we\n\t\t\t\t\tmean that it cannot be otherwise), and some which are not necessarily so, nor always, but\n\t\t\t\t\tusually: this is the principle and this the cause of the accidental.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor whatever is neither always nor usually so, we call an\n\t\t\t\t\taccident.E.g., if in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe dog-days we have storm and cold, we call it an\n\t\t\t\t\taccident; but not if we have stifling and intense heat, because the\n\t\t\t\t\tlatter always or usually comes at this time, but not the former. It is\n\t\t\t\t\taccidental for a man to be white (since this is neither always nor\n\t\t\t\t\tusually so), but it is not accidental for him to be an animal.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is by accident that a builder restores to\n\t\t\t\t\thealth, because it is not a builder but a doctor who naturally does\n\t\t\t\t\tthis; but the builder happened accidentally to be a doctor. A\n\t\t\t\t\tconfectioner, aiming at producing enjoyment, may produce something\n\t\t\t\t\thealth-giving; but not in virtue of his confectioner's art. Hence, we\n\t\t\t\t\tsay, it was accidental; and he produces it in a sense, but not in an\n\t\t\t\t\tunqualified sense.For\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are potencies which produce other things, but there is no art or\n\t\t\t\t\tdeterminate potency of accidents, since the cause of things which\n\t\t\t\t\texist or come to be by accident is also accidental.Hence, since not everything is or comes\n\t\t\t\t\tto be of necessity and always, but most things happen usually, the\n\t\t\t\t\taccidental must exist. E.g., the white man is neither always nor\n\t\t\t\t\tusually cultured; but since this sometimes happens, it must be\n\t\t\t\t\tregarded as accidental. Otherwise, everything must be regarded as of\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity.Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cause of the accidental is the matter, which admits of variation\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the usual.We must take this as our\n\t\t\t\t\tstarting-point: Is everything either \"always\" or \"usually\"? This is\n\t\t\t\t\tsurely impossible. Then besides these alternatives there is something\n\t\t\t\t\telse: the fortuitous and accidental. But again, are things\n\t\t\t\t\t so, but nothing  , or\n\t\t\t\t\tare there things which are eternal? These questions must be inquired\n\t\t\t\t\tinto later;but it is clear that there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tscience of the accidentalbecause all scientific knowledge\n\t\t\t\t\tis of that which is  or  so.\n\t\t\t\t\tHow else indeed can one learn it or teach it to another? For a fact\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be defined by being so always or usually; e.g., honey-water is\n\t\t\t\t\tusually beneficial in case of fever.But science will not be able to state the\n\t\t\t\t\texception to the rule: when it is not beneficiale.g. at the\n\t\t\t\t\tnew moon; because that which happens at the new moon also happens\n\t\t\t\t\teither always or usually; but the accidental is contrary to this. We\n\t\t\t\t\thave now explained the nature and cause of the accidental, and that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is no science of it.It is obvious that there are\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples and causes which are generable and destructible apart from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe actual processes of generation and destruction; for if this is not true, everything\n\t\t\t\t\twill be of necessity: that is, if there must necessarily be some\n\t\t\t\t\tcause, other than accidental, of that which is generated and\n\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed. Will A be, or not? Yes, if B happens; otherwise not. And B\n\t\t\t\t\twill happen if C does.It\n\t\t\t\t\tis clear that in this way, as time is continually subtracted from a\n\t\t\t\t\tlimited period, we shall come to the present. Accordingly So-and-so will die by disease or violence if he goes\n\t\t\t\t\tout; and this if he gets thirsty; and this if something else happens;\n\t\t\t\t\tand thus we shall come to what is the case now, or to something which\n\t\t\t\t\thas already happened. E.g. \"if he is thirsty\"; this will happen if he\n\t\t\t\t\tis eating pungent food, and this is either the case or not.Thus of necessity he will\n\t\t\t\t\teither die or not die. And similarly if one jumps over to the past,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe principle is the same; for thisI mean that which has\n\t\t\t\t\tjust happenedis already present in something. Everything,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, which is to be, will be of necessity; e.g., he who is alive must\n\t\t\t\t\tdiefor some stage of the process has been reached already;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g., the contraries are present in the same bodybut\n\t\t\t\t\twhether by disease or violence is not yet determined; it depends upon\n\t\t\t\t\twhether so-and-so happens.Clearly, then, the series goes back to some starting-point, which\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not go back to something else. This, therefore, will be the\n\t\t\t\t\tstarting-point of the fortuitous, and nothing else is the cause of its\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration. But to what sort of starting-point and cause this process\n\t\t\t\t\tof tracing back leads, whether to a material or final or moving cause,\n\t\t\t\t\tis a question for careful consideration.So much, then, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe accidental sense of \"being\"; we have defined it sufficiently. As\n\t\t\t\t\tfor \"being\"  truth, and \"not-being\"  falsity, since they depend upon\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination and separation,and taken together are concerned with the arrangement of the parts\n\t\t\t\t\tof a contradiction (since the true has affirmation when the subject\n\t\t\t\t\tand predicate are combined, and negation where they are divided; but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe false has the contrary arrangement.How it happens that we combine or separate in\n\t\t\t\t\tthought is another question. By \"combining or separating in thought\" I\n\t\t\t\t\tmean thinking them not as a succession but as a unity); for \"falsity\" and \"truth\" are not in\n\t\t\t\t\t the good, for example, being true, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe bad falsebut in  ; and with regard\n\t\t\t\t\tto simple concepts and essences there is no truth or falsity even in\n\t\t\t\t\tthought;what points we must study in connection with being and\n\t\t\t\t\tnot-being in this sense, we must consider later. But since the\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination and separation exists in thought and not in things, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthis sense of \"being\" is different from the proper senses (since\n\t\t\t\t\tthought attaches or detaches essence or quality or quantity or some\n\t\t\t\t\tother category), we may dismiss the accidental and real senses of \"being.\"For the cause of the one is indeterminate and\n\t\t\t\t\tof the other an affection of thought; and\n\t\t\t\t\tboth are connected with the remaining genus of \"being,\" and do not\n\t\t\t\t\tindicate any objective reality. Let us therefore dismiss them, and\n\t\t\t\t\tconsider the causes and principles of Being itself  Being. [We have made it clear in our distinction of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe number of senses in which each term is used that \"being\" has\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral senses.]"}}, {"@n": "7", "@type": "Book", "p":

It denotes first the \"  \" of a thing, i.e. the\n\t\t\t\t\tindividuality; and then the quality or quantity or any other such\n\t\t\t\t\tcategory. Now of all these senses which \"being\" has, the primary sense\n\t\t\t\t\tis clearly the \"what,\" which denotes the \n\t\t\t\t\t(because when we describe\n\t\t\t\t\tthe quality of a particular thing we say that it is \"good or bad,\" and\n\t\t\t\t\tnot \"five feet high\" or \"a man\"; but when we describe\n\t\t\t\t\t it is, we say not that it is \"white\" or \"hot\" or\n\t\t\t\t\t\"five feet high,\" but that it is \"a man\" or \"a god\"), and all other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are said to \"be\" because they are either quantities or\n\t\t\t\t\tqualities or affections or some other such thing.Hence one might\n\t\t\t\t\traise the question whether the terms \"to walk\" and \"to be well\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"to sit\" signify each of these things as \"being,\" or not; and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly in the case of any other such terms; for not one of them by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature has an independent existence or can be separated from its\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance. Rather, if anything it is the  which\n\t\t\t\t\twalks or sits or is well that is existent.The reason why these things are more truly\n\t\t\t\t\texistent is because their subject is something definite; i.e. the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance and the individual, which is clearly implied in a\n\t\t\t\t\tdesignation of this kind, since apart from it we cannot speak of \"the\n\t\t\t\t\tgood\" or \"sitting.\" Clearly then it is by reason of the substance that\n\t\t\t\t\teach of the things referred to exists.Hence that which  primarily,\n\t\t\t\t\tnot in a qualified sense but absolutely, will be substance.Now \"primary\" has several meanings; but\n\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless substance is primary in all senses, both in definition\n\t\t\t\t\tand in knowledge and in time. For none of the other categories can\n\t\t\t\t\texist separately, but substance alone;and it is primary also in definition, because\n\t\t\t\t\tin the formula of each thing the formula of substance must be\n\t\t\t\t\tinherent; and we assume that we know each particular thing most truly\n\t\t\t\t\twhen we know  \"man\" or \"fire\" is\n\t\t\t\t\trather than its quality or quantity or\n\t\t\t\t\tposition; because we know each of these points too when we know\n\t\t\t\t\t the quantity or quality is.Indeed, the question which was raised\n\t\t\t\t\tlong ago, is still and always will be, and which always baffles\n\t\t\t\t\tus\"What is Being?\"is in other words \"What is\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance?\" Some say that it is one; others, more\n\t\t\t\t\tthan one; some, finite; others, infinite. And so for us too our chief and primary and\n\t\t\t\t\tpractically our only concern is to investigate the nature of \"being\"\n\t\t\t\t\tin the sense of substance.Substance is thought to be\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent most obviously in bodies. Hence we call animals and plants and\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir parts substances, and also natural bodies, such as fire, water,\n\t\t\t\t\tearth, etc., and all things which are parts of these or composed of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese, either of parts or them or of their totality; e.g. the visible\n\t\t\t\t\tuniverse and its parts, the stars and moon and sun.We must consider whether (a) these are\n\t\t\t\t\tthe only substances, or (b) these and some others, or (c) some of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese, or (d) some of these and some others, or (e) none of these, but\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain others. Some hold that the bounds of bodyi.e.\n\t\t\t\t\tthe surface, line, point and unitare substances, and in a\n\t\t\t\t\ttruer sense than body or the solid.Again, some believe that there is\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing of this kind besides sensible things, while others believe in\n\t\t\t\t\teternal entities more numerous and more real than sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings.Thus Plato\n\t\t\t\t\tposited the Forms and the objects of mathematics as two kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, and as a third the substance of sensible bodies;and Speusippus assumed still more kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances, starting with \"the One,\" and positing principles for each\n\t\t\t\t\tkind: one for numbers, another for magnitudes, and then another for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe soul. In this way he multiplies the kinds of substance. Some again hold that the Forms and\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers have the same nature, and that other thingslines\n\t\t\t\t\tand planesare dependent upon them; and soon back to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance of the visible universe and sensible things.We must consider, then, with\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to these matters, which of the views expressed is right and\n\t\t\t\t\twhich wrong; and what things are substances; and whether there are any\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances besides the sensible substances, or not; and how sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances exist; and whether there is any separable substance (and if\n\t\t\t\t\tso, why and how) or no substance besides the sensible ones. We must\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst give a rough sketch of what substance is.The\n\t\t\t\t\tterm \"substance\" is used, if not in more, at least in four principal\n\t\t\t\t\tcases; for both the essence and the universal and the genus are held\n\t\t\t\t\tto be the substance of the particular, and fourthly the substrate. The\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstrate is that of which the rest are predicated, while it is not\n\t\t\t\t\titself predicated of anything else. Hence we must first determine its\n\t\t\t\t\tnature, for the primary substrate is considered\n\t\t\t\t\tto be in the truest sense substance.Now in one sense\n\t\t\t\t\twe call the  the substrate; in another, the\n\t\t\t\t\t ; and in a third, the combination of the two.\n\t\t\t\t\tBy matter I mean, for instance, bronze; by shape, the arrangement of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe form; and by the combination of the two, the concrete thing: the\n\t\t\t\t\tstatue. Thus if the form is prior to the matter and more truly\n\t\t\t\t\texistent, by the same argument it will also be prior to the\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination.We have now stated in outline the\n\t\t\t\t\tnature of substancethat it is not that which is predicated\n\t\t\t\t\tof a subject, but that of which the other things are predicated. But\n\t\t\t\t\twe must not merely define it so, for it is not enough. Not only is the\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement itself obscure, but also it makes matter substance; for if\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter is not substance, it is beyond our power to say what else\n\t\t\t\t\tis.For when\n\t\t\t\t\teverything else is removed, clearly nothing but matter remains;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause all the other things are affections, products and potencies of\n\t\t\t\t\tbodies, and length, breadth and depth are kinds of quantity, and not\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances. For quantity is not a substance; rather the substance is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat to which these affections primarily belong.But when we take away length and\n\t\t\t\t\tbreadth and depth we can see no thing remaining, unless it be the\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething bounded by them; so that on this view matter must appear to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe the only substance.By\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter I mean that which in itself is neither a particular thing nor a\n\t\t\t\t\tquantity nor designated by any of the categories which define\n\t\t\t\t\tBeing.For there is\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething of which each of these is predicated, whose being is\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent from that of each one of the categories; because all other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are predicated of substance, but this is predicated of matter.\n\t\t\t\t\tThus the ultimate substrate is in itself neither a particular thing\n\t\t\t\t\tnor a quantity nor anything else. Nor indeed is it the negations of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese; for the negations too will only apply to it\n\t\t\t\t\taccidentally.If we hold this view, it follows that\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter is substance. But this is impossible; for it is accepted that\n\t\t\t\t\tseparability and individuality belong especially to substance. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tit would seem that the form and the combination of form and matter are\n\t\t\t\t\tmore truly substance than matter is.The substance, then, which consists of\n\t\t\t\t\tbothI mean of matter and formmay be dismissed,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince it is posterior and obvious. Matter too is in a sense evident.\n\t\t\t\t\tWe must consider the third type, for this is the most\n\t\t\t\t\tperplexing.Now it is agreed that\n\t\t\t\t\tsome sensible things are substances, and so we should begin our\n\t\t\t\t\tinquiry in connection with these. It is convenient to advance to the more\n\t\t\t\t\tintelligible; for learning is always acquired\n\t\t\t\t\tin this way, by advancing through what is less intelligible by nature\n\t\t\t\t\tto what is more so. And just as in actions it is our task to start\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the good of the individual and make absolute good good for the\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual, so it is our\n\t\t\t\t\ttask to start from what is more intelligible to oneself and make what\n\t\t\t\t\tis by nature intelligible intelligible to oneself.Now that which is intelligible and\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary to individuals is often but slightly intelligible, and\n\t\t\t\t\tcontains but little reality; but nevertheless, starting from that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is imperfectly intelligible but intelligible to oneself, we must\n\t\t\t\t\ttry to understand the absolutely intelligible; advancing, as we have\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid, by means of these very things which are intelligible to\n\t\t\t\t\tus.Since we distinguished at the\n\t\t\t\t\tbeginning the number of ways in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich substance is defined, and since one of these appeared to be\n\t\t\t\t\tessence, we must investigate this.First, let us make certain linguistic\n\t\t\t\t\tstatements about it.The essence of each\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is that which it is said to be per se. \"To be you\" is not \"to be\n\t\t\t\t\tcultured,\" because you are not of your own nature cultured. Your\n\t\t\t\t\tessence, then, is that which you are said to beof your own nature. But not even all of this is the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence; for the essence is not that which is said to be per se in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsense that whiteness is said to belong to a surface, because \"being a surface\" is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\"being white.\"Nor is the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence the combination of both, \"being a white surface.\" Why? Because\n\t\t\t\t\tthe word itself is repeated.Hence the formula of the essence of each thing is that which defines\n\t\t\t\t\tthe term but does not contain it. Thus if \"being a white surface\" is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same as \"being a smooth surface,\" \"white\" and \"smooth\" are one and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same.But since in the other\n\t\t\t\t\tcategories too there are compounds with substance (because there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstrate for each category, e.g. quality, quantity, time, place and\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion), we must inquire whether there is a formula of the essence of\n\t\t\t\t\teach one of them; whether these compounds, e.g. \"white man,\" also have\n\t\t\t\t\tan essence. Let the compound be denoted by X.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the essence of X?\"But this is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot even a per se expression.\" We reply that there are two ways in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich a definition can be not per se true of its subject: (a) by an\n\t\t\t\t\taddition, and (b) by an omission.In one case the definition is not per se true\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the term which is being defined is combined with something\n\t\t\t\t\telse; as if, e.g., in defining whiteness one were to state the\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition of a white man. In the other, because something else (which\n\t\t\t\t\tis not in the definition) is combined with the subject; as if, e.g., X\n\t\t\t\t\twere to denote \"white man,\" and X were defined as \"white.\" \"White man\"\n\t\t\t\t\tis white, but its essence is not \"to be white.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tBut is \"to be X\" an essence at all?Surely not. The essence is an individual type;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut when a subject has something distinct from it predicated of it, it\n\t\t\t\t\tis not an individual type. E.g., \"white man\" is not an individual\n\t\t\t\t\ttype; that is, assuming that individuality belongs only to substances.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence essence belongs to all things the account of which is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition.We have\n\t\t\t\t\ta definition, not if the name and the account signify the same (for\n\t\t\t\t\tthen all accounts would be definitions; because any account can have a\n\t\t\t\t\tname, so that even \"the  \" will be a definition),\n\t\t\t\t\tbut if the account is of something primary. Such are all statements\n\t\t\t\t\twhich do not involve the predication of one thing of\n\t\t\t\t\tanother.Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tessence will belong to nothing except species of a genus, but to these\n\t\t\t\t\tonly; for in these the predicate is not considered to be related to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subject by participation or affection, nor as an accident. But of\n\t\t\t\t\teverything else as well, if it has a name, there will be a formula of\n\t\t\t\t\tthat X belongs to Y; or\n\t\t\t\t\tinstead of a simple formula one more exactbut no\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition, nor essence.Or perhaps \"definition,\" like\n\t\t\t\t\tthe \"what,\" has more than one sense. For the \"what\" in one sense means\n\t\t\t\t\tthe substance and the individual,and in another each one of the categories:\n\t\t\t\t\tquantity, quality, etc.Just as \"is\" applies to everything, although not in the same way,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut primarily to one thing and secondarily to others; so \"what it is\"\n\t\t\t\t\tapplies in an unqualified sense to substance, and to other things in a\n\t\t\t\t\tqualified sense. For we might ask also what quality \"is,\" so that\n\t\t\t\t\tquality also is a \"what it is\"; not however without qualification, but\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as in the case of not-being some say by a verbal quibble that\n\t\t\t\t\tnot-being \"is\"not in an unqualified sense, but \"is\"\n\t\t\t\t\tnot-beingso too with quality.Now although we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust also consider how we should express ourselves in each particular\n\t\t\t\t\tcase, it is still more important to consider what the facts are. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tnow, since the language which we are using is clear, similarly essence\n\t\t\t\t\talso will belong primarily and simply to substance, and secondarily to\n\t\t\t\t\tother things as well; just as the \"what it is\" is not essence simply,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut the essence of a quality or quantity.For it must be either by equivocation that we\n\t\t\t\t\tsay that these things  , or by adding and subtracting\n\t\t\t\t\tqualifications, as we say that the unknowable is known;\n\t\t\t\t\tsince the truth is that we use the terms neither equivocally nor in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same sense, but just as we use the term \"medical\" in\n\t\t\t\t\t to one and the same thing; but not  one and the same thing, nor\n\t\t\t\t\tyet equivocally. The term \"medical\" is applied to a body and a\n\t\t\t\t\tfunction and an instrument, neither equivocally nor in one sense, hut\n\t\t\t\t\tin relation to one thing.However, in whichever way one chooses to speak of these things, it\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters nothing; but this point is clear: that the primary and\n\t\t\t\t\tunqualified definition, and the essence, belong to substances. It is\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue that they belong equally to other things too, but not\n\t\t\t\t\t . For if we assume this, it does not\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily follow that there is a definition of anything which means\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same as any formula; it must mean the same as a particular kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tformula, i.e. the formula of one thingone not by continuity like the\n\t\t\t\t\t, or things which are arbitrarily combined,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut in one of the proper senses of \"one.\" And \"one\" has the same\n\t\t\t\t\tvariety of senses as \"being.\" \"Being\" means sometimes the individual\n\t\t\t\t\tthing, sometimes the quantity, sometimes the quality. Hence even\n\t\t\t\t\t\"white man\" will have a formula and definition; but in a different\n\t\t\t\t\tsense from the definition of \"whiteness\" and \"substance.\"The question arises: If one denies that a formula involving an added\n\t\t\t\t\tdeterminant is a definition, how can there be a definition of terms\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are not simple but coupled? Because they can only be explained\n\t\t\t\t\tby adding a determinant.I\n\t\t\t\t\tmean, e.g., there is \"nose\" and \"concavity\" and \"snubness,\" the term\n\t\t\t\t\tcompounded of the two, because the one is present in the other.\n\t\t\t\t\tNeither \"concavity\" nor \"snubness\" is an accidental, but a per se\n\t\t\t\t\taffection of the nose.Nor are they attributes in the sense that \"white\"\n\t\t\t\t\tis of Callias or a man, because Callias is white and is by accident a\n\t\t\t\t\tman; but in the sense that \"male\" is an attribute of animal, and\n\t\t\t\t\tequality of quantity, and all other attributes which we say belong per\n\t\t\t\t\tse.That is, all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which involve the formula or name of the subject of the\n\t\t\t\t\taffection, and cannot be explained apart from it. Thus \"white\" can be\n\t\t\t\t\texplained apart from \"man,\" but not \"female\" apart from \"animal.\" Thus\n\t\t\t\t\teither these terms have no essence or definition, or else they have it\n\t\t\t\t\tin a different sense, as we have said.But there is also\n\t\t\t\t\tanother difficulty about them. If \"snub nose\" is the same as \"concave\n\t\t\t\t\tnose,\" \"snub\" will be the same as \"concave.\" But if not, since it is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible to speak of \"snub\" apart from the thing of which it is a\n\t\t\t\t\tper se affection (because \"snub\" means a concavity in the nose),\n\t\t\t\t\teither it is impossible to call the nose snub, or it will be a\n\t\t\t\t\ttautology, \"concave-nose nose\" because \"snub nose\" will equal\n\t\t\t\t\t\"concave-nose nose.\"Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tit is absurd that such terms as these should have an essence.\n\t\t\t\t\tOtherwise there will be an infinite regression; for in \"snub-nose\n\t\t\t\t\tnose\" there will be yet another nose. Clearly, then, there is definition of substance alone. If there were\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition of the other categories also, it would have to involve an\n\t\t\t\t\tadded determinant, as in the case of the qualitative; and of the odd,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor this cannot be defined apart from number; nor can \"female\" apart\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom \"animal.\"By\n\t\t\t\t\t\"involving an added determinant\" I mean descriptions which involve a\n\t\t\t\t\ttautology, as in the above examples. Now if this is true, there will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe no definition of compound expressions either; e.g., \"odd number.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tWe fail to realize this because our terms are not used accurately. If\n\t\t\t\t\ton the other hand there are definitions of these too, either they are\n\t\t\t\t\tdefined in a different way, or, as we have said, \"definition\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"essence\" must be used in more than one sense;thus in one sense there will be no\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition of anything, and nothing will have an essence, except\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances; and in another those other things will have a definition\n\t\t\t\t\tand essence. It is obvious, then, that the definition is the formula\n\t\t\t\t\tof the essence, and that the essence belongs either \n\t\t\t\t\tto substances, or especially and primarily and simply.We must inquire whether the essence is the same as the particular\n\t\t\t\t\tthing, or different. This is useful for our inquiry about substance;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause a particular thing is considered to be nothing other than its\n\t\t\t\t\town substance, and the essence is called the substance of the\n\t\t\t\t\tthing.In accidental\n\t\t\t\t\tpredications, indeed, the thing itself would seem to be different from\n\t\t\t\t\tits essence;e.g., \"white\n\t\t\t\t\tman\" is different from \"essence of white man.\" If it were the same,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"essence of man\" and \"essence of white man\" would be the same. For\n\t\t\t\t\t\"man\" and \"white man\" are the same, they say, and therefore \"essence\n\t\t\t\t\tof white man\" is the same as \"essence of man.\"But perhaps it is not necessarily true\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the essence of accidental combinations is the same as that of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsimple terms; because the extremes of the syllogism are not identical\n\t\t\t\t\twith the middle term in the same way. Perhaps it might be thought to follow that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe accidental extremes are identical; e.g. \"essence of white\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"essence of cultured\"; but this is not admitted.But in\n\t\t\t\t\tper se expressions, is the thing necessarily the same as its essence,\n\t\t\t\t\te.g., if there are substances which have no other substances or\n\t\t\t\t\tentities prior to them, such as some hold the Ideas to be?For if the Ideal Good is to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent from the essence of good, and the Ideal Animal and Being\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the essence of animal and being, there\n\t\t\t\t\twill be other substances and entities and Ideas besides the ones which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey describe; and prior to them, if essence is substance. And if they\n\t\t\t\t\tare separate from each other, there will be no knowledge of the Ideas,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the essences will not exist(by \"being separate\" I mean if neither the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence of good is present in the Ideal Good, nor \"being good\" in the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence of good); for it is when we know the essence of it that we\n\t\t\t\t\thave knowledge of a thing. And it is the same with other essences as\n\t\t\t\t\twith the essence of good; so that if the essence of good is not good,\n\t\t\t\t\tneither will the essence of being \"be,\" nor the essence of one be\n\t\t\t\t\tone.Either all\n\t\t\t\t\tessences exist alike, or none of them; and so if not even the essence\n\t\t\t\t\tof being \"is,\" neither will any other essence exist. Again that to\n\t\t\t\t\twhich \"essentially good\" does not apply cannot be good. Hence \"the\n\t\t\t\t\tgood\" must be one with the essence of good, \"the beautiful\" with the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence of beauty, and so with all terms which are not dependent upon\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else, but self-subsistent and primary.For it is enough if this is so, even if they\n\t\t\t\t\tare not Forms; or perhaps rather even if they are. (At the same time\n\t\t\t\t\tit is clear also that if the Ideas are such as some hold, the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstrate will not be substance; for the Ideas must be substances, but\n\t\t\t\t\tnot involving a substrate, because if they did involve one they would\n\t\t\t\t\texist in virtue of its participation in them.)That each individual thing is\n\t\t\t\t\tone and the same with its essence, and not merely accidentally\n\t\t\t\t\tso,is apparent, not\n\t\t\t\t\tonly from the foregoing considerations, but because to have knowledge\n\t\t\t\t\tof the individual is to have knowledge of its essence; so that by\n\t\t\t\t\tsetting out examples it is evident that both must be\n\t\t\t\t\tidentical.But as\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the accidental term, e.g. \"cultured\" or \"white,\" since it has two\n\t\t\t\t\tmeanings, it is not true to say that the term itself is the same as\n\t\t\t\t\tits essence; for both the accidental term and that of which it is an\n\t\t\t\t\taccident are \"white,\" so that in one sense the essence and the term\n\t\t\t\t\titself are the same, and in another they are not, because the essence\n\t\t\t\t\tis not the same as \"the man\" or \"the white man,\" but it is the same as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe affection.The absurdity <of separating a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing from its essence> will be apparent also if one supplies a\n\t\t\t\t\tname for each essence; for then there will be another essence besides\n\t\t\t\t\tthe original one, e.g. the essence of \"horse\" will have a further\n\t\t\t\t\tessence. Yet why should not some things be identified with their\n\t\t\t\t\tessence from the outset,\n\t\t\t\t\tif essence is substance? Indeed not only are the thing and its essence\n\t\t\t\t\tone, but their formula is the same, as is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear from what we have just stated; for it is not by accident that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe essence of \"one,\" and \"the one,\" are one.Moreover, if they are different, there\n\t\t\t\t\twill be an infinite series; for the essence of \"one\" and \"the one\"\n\t\t\t\t\twill both exist; so that in that case too the same principle will\n\t\t\t\t\tapply. Clearly, then, in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary and self-subsistent terms, the individual thing and its\n\t\t\t\t\tessence are one and the same.It is obvious that the\n\t\t\t\t\tsophistical objections to this thesis are met in the same way as the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion whether Socrates is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same as the essence of \n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates; for there is no difference either in the\n\t\t\t\t\tgrounds for asking the question or in the means of meeting it\n\t\t\t\t\tsuccessfully. We have now explained in what sense the essence is, and\n\t\t\t\t\tin what sense it is not, the same as the individual thing.Of things which are generated, some are generated naturally, others\n\t\t\t\t\tartificially, and others spontaneously; but everything which is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated is generated by something and from something and becomes\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething. When I say \"becomes something\" I mean in any of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcategories; it may come to be either a particular thing or of some\n\t\t\t\t\tquantity or quality or in some place.Natural generation is the generation of things whose generation is\n\t\t\t\t\tby nature.That from which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are generated is what we call matter; that by which, is something\n\t\t\t\t\twhich exists naturally; and that which they become is a man or a plant\n\t\t\t\t\tor something else of this kind, which we call substance in the highest\n\t\t\t\t\tdegree.All things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are generated naturally or artificially have matter; for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible for each one of them both to be and not to be, and this\n\t\t\t\t\tpossibility is the matter in each individual thing.And in general both that from which and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat in accordance with which they are generated, is nature; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tthing generated, e.g. plant or animal, has a nature. And that by which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are generated is the so-called \"formal\" nature, which has the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame form as the thing generated (although it is in something else);\n\t\t\t\t\tfor man begets man.Such is the\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration of things which are naturally generated; the other kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration are called productions. All productions proceed from either\n\t\t\t\t\tart or potency or thought.Some of them are also generated spontaneously and by chance in much\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same way as things which are naturally generated; for sometimes\n\t\t\t\t\teven in the sphere of nature the same things are generated both from\n\t\t\t\t\tseed and without it.\n\t\t\t\t\tWe shall consider cases of this kind later.\n\t\t\t\t\tThings are generated artificially whose form is\n\t\t\t\t\tcontained in the soul (by \"form\" I mean the essence of each thing, and\n\t\t\t\t\tits primary substance);for\n\t\t\t\t\teven contraries have in a sense the same form. For the substance of the\n\t\t\t\t\tprivation is the opposite substance; e.g., health is the substance of\n\t\t\t\t\tdisease; for disease is the absence of health, and health is the\n\t\t\t\t\tformula and knowledge in the soul. Now the healthy subject is produced\n\t\t\t\t\tas the result of this reasoning: since health is so-and-so, if the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject is to be healthy, it must have such-and-such a quality, e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\thomogeneity; and if so, it must have heat.And the physician continues reasoning until he\n\t\t\t\t\tarrives at what he himself finally can do; then the process from this\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint onwards, i.e. the process towards health, is called\n\t\t\t\t\t\"production.\" Therefore it follows in a sense that health comes from\n\t\t\t\t\thealth and a house from a house; that which has matter from that which\n\t\t\t\t\thas not (for the art of medicine or of building is the\n\t\t\t\t\t of health or the house). By substance without matter\n\t\t\t\t\tI mean the essence.In generations and motions part of the\n\t\t\t\t\tprocess is called cogitation, and part productionthat which\n\t\t\t\t\tproceeds from the starting-point and the form is cogitation, and that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich proceeds from the conclusion of the cogitation is production.\n\t\t\t\t\tEach of the other intermediate measures is carried out in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tway. I mean, e.g., that if A is to be healthy, his physical condition\n\t\t\t\t\twill have to be made uniform. What, then, does being made uniform\n\t\t\t\t\tentail? So-and-so;and this\n\t\t\t\t\twill be achieved if he is made hot. What does this entail? So-and-so;\n\t\t\t\t\tnow this is potentially present, and the thing is now in his\n\t\t\t\t\tpower.The thing which produces, and from which the\n\t\t\t\t\tprocess of recovering health begins, is the form in the soul, if the\n\t\t\t\t\tprocess is artificial; if spontaneous, it is whatever is the\n\t\t\t\t\tstarting-point of the production for the artificial producer; as in\n\t\t\t\t\tmedical treatment the starting-point is, perhaps, the heating of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpatient; and this the doctor produces by friction. Heat in the body,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, is either a part of health, or is followed (directly or through\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral intermediaries) by something similar which is a part of\n\t\t\t\t\thealth. This is the ultimate thing, namely that produces, and in this\n\t\t\t\t\tsense is a part of, healthor of the house (in the form of stones) or of other things. Therefore, as we say,\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration would be impossible if nothing were already existent. It is\n\t\t\t\t\tclear, then, that some part must necessarily pre-exist; because the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter is a part, since it is matter which pre-exists in the product\n\t\t\t\t\tand becomes something. But then is matter part of the\n\t\t\t\t\tformula? Well, we define bronze circles in both ways; we describe the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter as bronze, and the form as such-and-such a shape; and this\n\t\t\t\t\tshape is the proximate genus in which the circle is placed.The bronze circle, then, has\n\t\t\t\t\tits matter in its formula. Now as for that from which, as matter,\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are generated, some things when they are generated are called\n\t\t\t\t\tnot \"so-and-so,\" but \"made of so-and-so\"; e.g., a statue is not called\n\t\t\t\t\tstone, but made of stone. But the man who becomes healthy is not\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled after that from which he becomes healthy. This is because the\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration proceeds from the privation and the substrate, which we\n\t\t\t\t\tcall matter (e.g., both \"the man\" and \"the invalid\" become\n\t\t\t\t\thealthy),but it is\n\t\t\t\t\tmore properly said to proceed from the privation; e.g., a man becomes\n\t\t\t\t\thealthy from being an invalid rather than from being a man. Hence a\n\t\t\t\t\thealthy person is not called an invalid, but a man, and a healthy man.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut where the privation is obscure and has no namee.g. in\n\t\t\t\t\tbronze the privation of any given shape, or in bricks and wood the\n\t\t\t\t\tprivation of the shape of a housethe generation is\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidered to proceed from these materials, as in the former case from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe invalid.Hence just as\n\t\t\t\t\tin the former case the subject is not called that from which it is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated, so in this case the statue is not called wood, but is\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled by a verbal change not wood, but wooden; not bronze, but made\n\t\t\t\t\tof bronze; not stone, but made of stone; and the house is called not\n\t\t\t\t\tbricks, but made of bricks.For if we consider the matter carefully, we should not even say\n\t\t\t\t\twithout qualification that a statue is generated from wood, or a house\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom bricks; because that from which a thing is generated should not\n\t\t\t\t\tpersist, but be changed. This, then, is why we speak in this\n\t\t\t\t\tway.Now since that which is generated is generated\n\t\t\t\t\t something (by which I mean the starting-point of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe process of generation), and  something (by which\n\t\t\t\t\tlet us understand not the privation but the matter; for we have\n\t\t\t\t\talready distinguished the meanings of these), and \n\t\t\t\t\tsomething (i.e. a sphere or circle or whatever else it may be); just\n\t\t\t\t\tas the craftsman does not produce the substrate, i.e. the bronze, so\n\t\t\t\t\tneither does he produce the sphere; except accidentally, inasmuch as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe bronze sphere is a sphere, and he makes the former.For to make an individual thing\n\t\t\t\t\tis to make it out of the substrate in the fullest sense. I mean that\n\t\t\t\t\tto make the bronze round is not to make the round or the sphere, but\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else; i.e. to produce this form in another medium. For if we\n\t\t\t\t\tmake the form, we must make it out of something else; for this has\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen assumed. E.g., we make a bronze sphere; we do\n\t\t\t\t\tthis in the sense that from A, i.e. bronze, we make B, i.e. a\n\t\t\t\t\tsphere.If, then, we\n\t\t\t\t\tmake the spherical form itself, clearly we shall have to make it in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same way; and the processes of generation will continue to\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinity.It is therefore obvious\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the form (or whatever we should call the shape in the sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthing) is not generatedgeneration does not apply to\n\t\t\t\t\tit nor is the essence generated; for this is that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tinduced in something else either by art or by nature or by\n\t\t\t\t\tpotency.But we do\n\t\t\t\t\tcause a bronze sphere to be, for we produce it from bronze and a\n\t\t\t\t\tsphere; we induce the form into this particular matter, and the result\n\t\t\t\t\tis a bronze sphere. But if the essence of sphere in general is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated, something must be generated from something; for that which\n\t\t\t\t\tis generated will always have to be divisible, and be partly one thing\n\t\t\t\t\tand partly another; I mean partly matter and partly form.If then a sphere is the figure\n\t\t\t\t\twhose circumference is everywhere equidistant from the center, part of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis will be the medium in which that which we produce will be\n\t\t\t\t\tcontained, and part will be in that medium; and the whole will be the\n\t\t\t\t\tthing generated, as in the case of the bronze sphere. It is obvious,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, from what we have said, that the thing in the sense of form or\n\t\t\t\t\tessence is not generated, whereas the concrete whole which is called\n\t\t\t\t\tafter it is generated; and that in everything that is generated matter\n\t\t\t\t\tis present, and one part is matter and the other form.Is there then some\n\t\t\t\t\tsphere besides the particular spheres, or some house besides the\n\t\t\t\t\tbricks? Surely no individual thing would ever have been generated if\n\t\t\t\t\tform had existed thus independently. Form means \"of such a kind\"; it is not a\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinite individual, but we produce or generate from the individual\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething \"of such a kind\"; and when it is generated it is an\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual \"of such a kind.\"The whole individual, Callias or\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates, corresponds to \"this bronze sphere,\" but\n\t\t\t\t\t\"man\" and \"animal\" correspond to bronze sphere in general.Obviously therefore the cause which consists\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Forms (in the sense in which some speak of them, assuming that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are certain entities besides particulars), in respect at least\n\t\t\t\t\tof generation and destruction, is useless; nor, for this reason at any\n\t\t\t\t\trate, should they be regarded as self-subsistent substances.Indeed in some cases it is even\n\t\t\t\t\tobvious that that which generates is of the same kind as that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneratednot however identical with it, nor numerically one\n\t\t\t\t\twith it, but formally onee.g. in natural productions (for\n\t\t\t\t\tman begets man), unless something happens contrary to nature, as when\n\t\t\t\t\ta horse sires a mule. And even these cases are similar; for that which\n\t\t\t\t\twould be common to both horse and ass, the genus immediately above\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, has no name; but it would probably be both, just as the mule is\n\t\t\t\t\tboth.\n\t\t\t\t\tThus obviously there is no need to set\n\t\t\t\t\tup a form as a pattern (for we should have looked for Forms in these\n\t\t\t\t\tcases especially, since living things are in a special sense\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances); the thing which generates is sufficient to produce, and\n\t\t\t\t\tto be the cause of the form in the matter. The completed whole,\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch-and-such a form induced in this flesh and these bones, is Callias\n\t\t\t\t\tor Socrates. And it is\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent from that which generated it, because the matter is\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent but identical in form, because the form is\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible.The question might be raised why some\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are generated both artificially and\n\t\t\t\t\tspontaneouslye.g. healthand others not; e.g. a\n\t\t\t\t\thouse. The reason is that in some cases the matterwhich is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe starting-point of the process in the production and generation of\n\t\t\t\t\tartificial things, and in which some part of the result is already\n\t\t\t\t\texistentis such that it can initiate its own motion, and in\n\t\t\t\t\tother cases it is not; and of the former kind some can initiate motion\n\t\t\t\t\tin a particular way, and some cannot. For many things can move\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, but not in a particular way, e.g. so as to\n\t\t\t\t\tdance.It is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible, then, for any things whose matter is of this kind (e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tstones) to be moved in  particular way except by\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else; but in  particular way it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible. And it is so with fire. For this reason some things cannot exist\n\t\t\t\t\tapart from the possessor of the art, and others can;because the motion can be initiated by\n\t\t\t\t\tthose things which do not indeed possess the art, but can themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tbe moved either by other things which do not possess the art, or by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe motion from the part of the product which pre-exists in them.It is clear also from what we have said\n\t\t\t\t\tthat in a sense all artificial things are generated either from\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething which bears the same name (as is the case with natural\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects) or from a part of themselves which bears the same name as\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves (e.g. a house from a house, inasmuch as it is generated by\n\t\t\t\t\tmind; for the art is the form), or from something which contains some\n\t\t\t\t\tpart; that is if the generation is not accidental; for the direct and\n\t\t\t\t\tindependent cause of the production is a part of the\n\t\t\t\t\tproduct.Heat in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion produces heat in the body; and either this is health or a part\n\t\t\t\t\tof health, or a part of health or health accompanies it. And this is\n\t\t\t\t\twhy heat is said to produce health, because it produces that of which\n\t\t\t\t\thealth is a concomitant and consequence. Therefore as essence is the\n\t\t\t\t\tstarting-point of everything in syllogisms (because syllogisms start\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the \"what\" of a thing), so too generation proceeds from\n\t\t\t\t\tit.And it is the same with natural formations as\n\t\t\t\t\tit is with the products of art. For the seed produces just as do those\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which function by art. It contains the form potentially,\n\t\t\t\t\tand that from which the seed comes has\n\t\t\t\t\tin some sense the same name as the product (for we must not expect\n\t\t\t\t\tthat all should have the same name in the sense that \"man\" is produced\n\t\t\t\t\tby \"man\"since woman is also produced by man); unless the\n\t\t\t\t\tproduct is a freak. This is why a mule is not produced by a\n\t\t\t\t\tmule.Those natural objects which are produced, like\n\t\t\t\t\tartificial objects, spontaneously, are those whose matter can also\n\t\t\t\t\tinitiate for itself that motion which the seed initiates. Those whose\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter cannot do this cannot be generated otherwise than by their\n\t\t\t\t\tproper parents.It is not only with\n\t\t\t\t\treference to substance that our argument shows that the form is not\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated; the same argument is common in its application to all the\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary divisions, i.e. quantity, quality and the other\n\t\t\t\t\tcategories.For just\n\t\t\t\t\tas the bronze sphere is generated, but not the sphere nor the bronze;\n\t\t\t\t\tand as in the case of bronze, if it is generated the form and matter\n\t\t\t\t\tare not (because they must always pre-exist), so it is too with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\"what\" and the quality and quantity and the other categories\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly; for it is not the quality that is generated, but the wood\n\t\t\t\t\tof that quality; nor is it the size, but the wood or animal of that\n\t\t\t\t\tsize.But a\n\t\t\t\t\tpeculiarity of substance may be gathered from this: that some other\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance must pre-exist in actuality which produces it; e.g. an\n\t\t\t\t\tanimal, if an animal is being generated; but a quality or quantity\n\t\t\t\t\tneed not pre-exist otherwise than potentially.Since a\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition is a formula, and every formula has parts; and since the\n\t\t\t\t\tformula is related to the thing in the same way as the part of the\n\t\t\t\t\tformula to the part of the thing, the question now\n\t\t\t\t\tarises: Must the formula of the parts be contained in the formula of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe whole, or not? It seems clear that it is so in some cases, but not\n\t\t\t\t\tin others.The formula of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe circle does not include that of the segments, but the formula of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe syllable includes that of the letters. And yet the circle is\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisible into its segments in just the same way as the syllable into\n\t\t\t\t\tits letters.Again, if the parts are\n\t\t\t\t\tprior to the whole, and the acute angle is part of the right angle,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the finger part of the animal, the acute angle will be prior to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe right angle, and the finger to the man.But it is considered that the latter are\n\t\t\t\t\tprior; for in the formula the parts are explained from them; and the\n\t\t\t\t\twholes are prior also in virtue of their ability to exist\n\t\t\t\t\tindependently. The truth probably is that \"part\" has several meanings,\n\t\t\t\t\tone of which is \"that which measures in respect of quantity.\" However,\n\t\t\t\t\tlet us dismiss this question and consider of what, in the sense of\n\t\t\t\t\tparts, substance consists. If\n\t\t\t\t\tthen matter, form, and the combination of the two are distinct, and if\n\t\t\t\t\tboth matter and form and their combination are substance, there is one\n\t\t\t\t\tsense in which even matter may be called \"part\" of a thing; and\n\t\t\t\t\tanother in which it is not, but the only parts are those elements of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the formula of the form consists. E.g., flesh is not a part of\n\t\t\t\t\tconcavity, because flesh is the matter in which concavity is induced;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut it is a part of snubness. And bronze is part of the statue as a\n\t\t\t\t\tconcrete whole, but not of the statue in the sense of form.We may speak of the form (or\n\t\t\t\t\tthe thing as having a form) as an individual thing, but we may never\n\t\t\t\t\tso speak of that which is material by itself. This is why the formula\n\t\t\t\t\tof the circle does not contain that of the segments, whereas the\n\t\t\t\t\tformula of the syllable does contain that of the letters; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tletters are parts of the formula of the form; they are not matter; but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe segments are parts in the sense of matter in which the form is\n\t\t\t\t\tinduced. They approximate, however, more closely to the form than does\n\t\t\t\t\tthe bronze when roundness is engendered in bronze.But there is a sense in which not even\n\t\t\t\t\tall the letters will be contained in the formula of the syllable; e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular letters on wax or sounds in the air; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthese too are part of the syllable in the sense that they are its\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible matter.For even\n\t\t\t\t\tif the line is divided and resolved into its halves, or if the man is\n\t\t\t\t\tresolved into bones and muscles and flesh,it does not follow that they are\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of these as parts of their essence, but as their matter; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthese are parts of the concrete whole, but not of the form, or that to\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the formula refers. Hence they are not in the\n\t\t\t\t\tformulae.Accordingly in some cases the formula will include the formula of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch parts as the above, but in others it need not necessarily contain\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir formula, unless it is the formula of the concrete object. It is\n\t\t\t\t\tfor this reason that some things are composed of parts in the sense of\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples into which they can be resolved, while others are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot.All things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are concrete combinations of form and matter (e.g. \"the snub\" or\n\t\t\t\t\tthe bronze circle) can be resolved into form and matter, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter is a part of them; but such as are not concrete combinations\n\t\t\t\t\twith matter, but are without matterwhose formulae refer to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe form onlycannot be resolved; either not at all, or at\n\t\t\t\t\tleast not in this way.Thus these material components are principles and parts of the\n\t\t\t\t\tconcrete objects, but they are neither parts nor principles of the\n\t\t\t\t\tform. For this reason the clay statue can be resolved into clay, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sphere into bronze, and Callias into flesh and bones, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tcircle too into segments, because it is something which is combined\n\t\t\t\t\twith matter. For we use the same name for the\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolute circle and for the particular circle, since there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tspecial name for the particular circles.We have now\n\t\t\t\t\tstated the truth; nevertheless let us recapitulate and state it more\n\t\t\t\t\tclearly. All constituents which are parts of the formula, and into\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the formula can be divided, are prior to their\n\t\t\t\t\twholeseither all or some of them. But the formula of the\n\t\t\t\t\tright angle is not divisible into the formula of an acute angle, but\n\t\t\t\t\tvice versa; since in defining the acute angle we use the right angle,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause \"the acute angle is less than a right angle.\"It is the same with the\n\t\t\t\t\tcircle and the semicircle; for the semicircle is defined by means of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe circle. And the finger is defined by means of the whole body; for\n\t\t\t\t\ta finger is a particular kind of part of a man. Thus such parts as are\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterial, and into which the whole is resolved as into matter, are\n\t\t\t\t\tposterior to the whole; but such as are parts in the sense of parts of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe formula and of the essence as expressed in the formula, are prior;\n\t\t\t\t\teither all or some of them.And since the soul of animals (which is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance of the living creature) is their substance in accordance\n\t\t\t\t\twith the formula, and the form and essence of that particular kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tbody (at least each part, if it is to be properly defined, will not be\n\t\t\t\t\tdefined apart from its function; and this will not belong to it apart\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom perception); therefore the parts of the soul are prior, either\n\t\t\t\t\tall or some of them, to the concrete animal; and similarly in other\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual cases.But the body and its parts\n\t\t\t\t\tare posterior to this substance, and it is not the substance, but the\n\t\t\t\t\tconcrete whole, which is resolved into these parts as into matter.\n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore in one sense these parts are prior to the concrete whole,\n\t\t\t\t\tand in another not; for they cannot exist in separation. A finger\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot in every state be a part of a living animal; for the dead\n\t\t\t\t\tfinger has only the name in common with the living one.Some parts are contemporary\n\t\t\t\t\twith the whole: such as are indispensable and in which the formula and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe essence are primarily present; e.g. the heart or perhaps the\n\t\t\t\t\tbrain, for it does not matter\n\t\t\t\t\twhich of them is of this nature. But \"man\" and \"horse\" and terms which\n\t\t\t\t\tare applied in this way to individuals, but universally, are not\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, but a kind of concrete whole composed of \n\t\t\t\t\tparticular formula and  particular matter regarded as\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal. But individually\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates is already composed of ultimate matter; and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly in all other cases.A part, then, may be part of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe form (by form I mean essence), or of the concrete whole composed\n\t\t\t\t\tof form and matter, or of the matter itself. But only the parts of the\n\t\t\t\t\tform are parts of the formula, and the formula refers to the\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal; for \"circle\" is the same as \"essence of\n\t\t\t\t\tcircle,\" and \"soul\" the same as \"essence of soul.\"But when we come to the concrete thing,\n\t\t\t\t\te.g. this circlewhich is a particular individual, either\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible or intelligible (by intelligible circles I mean those of\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematics, and by sensible those which are of bronze\n\t\t\t\t\tor wood)of these individuals there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition;we\n\t\t\t\t\tapprehend them by intelligence or perception; and when they have\n\t\t\t\t\tpassed from the sphere of actuality it is uncertain whether they exist\n\t\t\t\t\tor not, but they are always spoken of and apprehended by the universal\n\t\t\t\t\tformula. But the matter is in itself unknowable. Some matter is\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible and some intelligible; sensible, such as bronze and wood and\n\t\t\t\t\tall movable matter; intelligible, that which is present in sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings not  sensible, e.g. the objects of\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematics.We have now discussed the case of the whole and part, and of prior\n\t\t\t\t\tand posterior. But we must answer the question, when we are asked\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is priorthe right angle and circle and animal, or\n\t\t\t\t\tthat into which they are resolved and of which they are composed, i.e.\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir partsby saying that neither is\n\t\t\t\t\t prior.For if the soul also  the\n\t\t\t\t\tanimal or living thing, or the soul of the individual \n\t\t\t\t\tthe individual, and \"being a circle\"  the circle, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"being a right angle\" or the essence of the right angle\n\t\t\t\t\t the right angle, then we must admit that the whole in\n\t\t\t\t\tone sense is posterior to the part in one sense:e.g. to the parts in the formula and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe parts of a particular right angle(since both the material right angle of bronze\n\t\t\t\t\tand the right angle included by individual lines are posterior to\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir parts), but the immaterial angle is posterior to the parts in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe formula, but prior to the parts in the individual. We must not\n\t\t\t\t\tgive an unqualified answer. And if the soul is not the animal but\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else, even so we must say that some wholes are prior and\n\t\t\t\t\tsome are not, as has been stated.The question\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally presents itself, what sort of parts belong to the form and\n\t\t\t\t\twhat sort belong not to it but to the concrete object. Yet if this is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot plain it is impossible to define the particular; because the\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition refers to the universal and the form. Therefore if it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot clear what kind of parts are material and what kind are not, the\n\t\t\t\t\tformula of the thing will not be clear either.In the case of things which can be seen\n\t\t\t\t\tto be induced in specifically different materials, as, e.g., a circle\n\t\t\t\t\tis in bronze and stone and wood, it seems clear that these things, the\n\t\t\t\t\tbronze and the stone, are in no sense part of the essential substance\n\t\t\t\t\tof the circle, because it is separable from them.As for things which are not visibly\n\t\t\t\t\tseparable, there is no reason why the same should not apply to them;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g., if all the circles that had ever been seen were bronze;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the bronze would be none the less\n\t\t\t\t\tno part of the form, but it is difficult to separate it in\n\t\t\t\t\tthought.For\n\t\t\t\t\texample, the form of \"man\" is always manifested in flesh and bones and\n\t\t\t\t\telements of this kind; then are these actually parts of the form and\n\t\t\t\t\tformula, or are they not so, but matter, though since the form is not\n\t\t\t\t\tinduced in other materials, we cannot separate it?Now since this seems to be possible,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut it is not clear , some thinkers are\n\t\t\t\t\tdoubtful even in the case of the circle and the triangle, considering\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is not proper to define them by lines and continuous space,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut that all these are to the circle or triangle as flesh or bone is\n\t\t\t\t\tto man, and bronze or stone to the statue; and they reduce everything\n\t\t\t\t\tto numbers, and say that the formula of \"line\" is the formula of\n\t\t\t\t\t2.And of the\n\t\t\t\t\texponents of the Forms, some make 2 the Ideal line, and some the form\n\t\t\t\t\tof the line;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor they say that in some cases the form and that of which it is the\n\t\t\t\t\tform, e.g. 2 and the form of 2, are the same; but in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"line\" this is no longer so.It follows, then, that there is one form of\n\t\t\t\t\tmany things whose form is clearly different (a consequence which\n\t\t\t\t\tconfronted the Pythagoreans too), and that\n\t\t\t\t\tit is possible to make one supreme Form of everything, and not to\n\t\t\t\t\tregard the rest as forms.In\n\t\t\t\t\tthis way, however, all things would be one.Now we\n\t\t\t\t\thave stated that the question of definitions involves some difficulty,\n\t\t\t\t\tand have shown why this is so. Hence to reduce everything in this way\n\t\t\t\t\tand to dispose of the matter is going too far; for some things are\n\t\t\t\t\tpresumably a particular form in particular matter, or particular\n\t\t\t\t\tthings in a particular state.And the analogy in the case of the living\n\t\t\t\t\tthing which the younger\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates used to state is not a good one; for it\n\t\t\t\t\tleads one away from the truth, and makes one suppose that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible for a man to exist without his parts, as a circle does\n\t\t\t\t\twithout the bronze. But the case is not similar; for the animal is\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible and cannot be defined without motion, and hence not unless\n\t\t\t\t\tits parts are in some definite condition;for it is not the hand in \n\t\t\t\t\tcondition that is a part of a man, but only when it can perform its\n\t\t\t\t\tfunction, and so has life in it. Without life in it it is not a\n\t\t\t\t\tpart.And with respect to\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical objects, why are the formulae of the parts not parts of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe formulae of the whole; e.g., why are the formulae of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsemicircles not parts of the formula of the circle? for they are not\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible.Probably\n\t\t\t\t\tthis makes no difference; because there will be matter even of some\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which are not sensible. Indeed there will be\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter in some sense in everything which is not essence or form\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidered independently, but a particular thing. Thus the semicircles\n\t\t\t\t\twill be parts not of the universal circle but of the particular\n\t\t\t\t\tcircles, as we said beforefor\n\t\t\t\t\tsome matter is sensible, and some intelligible.It is clear also that the soul is the\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary substance, and the body matter; and \"man\" or \"animal\" is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination of both taken universally. And \"\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates\" or \"Coriscus\" has a\n\t\t\t\t\tdouble sense, that is if the soul too can be called\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates (for by\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates some mean the soul and\n\t\t\t\t\tsome the concrete person); but if\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates means simply  soul and\n\t\t\t\t\t body, the individual is composed similarly to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe universal.Whether there is some other material\n\t\t\t\t\tcomponent of these substances besides their matter, and whether we\n\t\t\t\t\tshould look for some further substance in them, such as numbers or\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething of that kind, must be considered later. It\n\t\t\t\t\tis with a view to this that we are trying to determine the nature of\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible substances, since in a sense the study of sensible substances\n\t\t\t\t\tbelongs to physics or secondary philosophy; for the physicist must\n\t\t\t\t\tknow not only about the matter, but also about the substance according\n\t\t\t\t\tto the formula; this is even more essential.And in the case of definitions, in what\n\t\t\t\t\tsense the elements in the formula are parts of the definition, and why\n\t\t\t\t\tthe definition is one formula (for the thing is clearly one,but in virtue of what is it one,\n\t\t\t\t\tseeing that it has parts?); this must be considered later.We\n\t\t\t\t\thave stated, then, in a general account which covers all cases, what\n\t\t\t\t\tessence is, and how it is independent; and why the formula of the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence of some things contains the parts of the thing defined, while\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of others does not; and we have shown that the material parts of\n\t\t\t\t\ta thing cannot be present in the formula of the substance (since they\n\t\t\t\t\tare not even parts of the substance in that sense, but of the concrete\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance; and of this in one sense there is a formula, and in another\n\t\t\t\t\tsense there is not.There\n\t\t\t\t\tis no formula involving the matter, for this is indeterminate; but\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is a formula in accordance with the primary substance, e.g., in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case of a man, the formula of the soul; because the substance is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe indwelling form, of which and of the matter the so called concrete\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance is composed. E.g., concavity is such a form, since from this\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"nose\" is derived \"snub nose\" and \"snubness\"for \"nose\"\n\t\t\t\t\twill be present twice over in these expressions);but in the concrete substance, e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tsnub nose or Callias, matter will be present too. We\n\t\t\t\t\thave stated also that the essence and the individual are in some cases\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same, as in the case of the primary\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances; e.g. crookedness and \"essence of crookedness,\" if this is\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary.By primary\n\t\t\t\t\tI mean that which does not imply the presence of something in\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else as a material substrate. But such things as are\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterial or are compounded with matter are not the same as their\n\t\t\t\t\tessence; not even if they are accidentally one, e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates and \"cultured\"; for these\n\t\t\t\t\tare only accidentally the same.Now let us first\n\t\t\t\t\tdeal with definition, in so far as it has not been dealt with in the\n\t\t\t\t\t; for the problem stated there has a bearing upon our\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussion of substance. The problem I mean is this: what constitutes\n\t\t\t\t\tthe unity of the thing of which we say that the formula is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition? E.g., in the case of man, \"two-footed animal\"; for let us\n\t\t\t\t\ttake this as the formula of \"man.\"Why, then, is this a unity and not a\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality, \"animal\" and \"two-footed\"? For in the case of \"man\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"white\" we have a plurality when the latter does not refer to the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer, but a unity when it does refer to it, and the subject, \"man,\"\n\t\t\t\t\thas an attribute; for then they become a unity and we have \"the white\n\t\t\t\t\tman.\"But in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase before us one term does not partake of the other; the genus is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot considered to partake of its differentiae, for then the same thing\n\t\t\t\t\twould be partaking simultaneously of contraries,since the differentiae by which the\n\t\t\t\t\tgenus is distinguished are contrary. And even if it does partake of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, the same argument applies, since the differentiae are many; e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tterrestrial, two-footed, wingless.Why is it that these are a unity and not a\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality? Not because they are present in one genus, for in that case\n\t\t\t\t\tall the differentiae of the genus will form a unity. But all the\n\t\t\t\t\telements in the definition must form a unity, because the definition\n\t\t\t\t\tis a kind of formula which is one and defines substance, so that it\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be a formula of one particular thing; because the substance\n\t\t\t\t\tdenotes one thing and an individual, as we say.We must first examine\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinitions which are reached by the process of division.For there is nothing else in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe definition but the primary genus and the differentiae; the other\n\t\t\t\t\tgenera consist of the primary genus together with the differentiae\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are taken with it. E.g., the primary genus is \"animal\"; the next\n\t\t\t\t\tbelow it, \"two-footed animal\"; and again, \"two-footed wingless\n\t\t\t\t\tanimal\"; and similarly also if the expression contains more terms\n\t\t\t\t\tstill. In general it does not matter whether it\n\t\t\t\t\tcontains many or few terms, nor, therefore, whether it contains few or\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo. Of the two one is differentia and the other genus; e.g., in\n\t\t\t\t\t\"two-footed animal\" \"animal\" is genus, and the other term\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentia.If,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, the genus absolutely does not exist apart from the species which\n\t\t\t\t\tit includes, or if it exists, but only as matter (for speech is genus\n\t\t\t\t\tand matter, and the differentiae make the species, i.e. the letters,\n\t\t\t\t\tout of it), obviously the definition is the formula composed of the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiae.But further we must also divide by the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentia of the differentia. E.g., \"having feet\" is a differentia\n\t\t\t\t\tof \"animal\"; then in turn we must discover the differentia of \"animal\n\t\t\t\t\thaving feet\"  \"having feet.\" Accordingly we\n\t\t\t\t\tshould not say that of \"that which has feet\" one kind is winged and\n\t\t\t\t\tanother wingless, (that is if we are to speak correctly; if we say\n\t\t\t\t\tthis it will be through incapability), but only that one kind is\n\t\t\t\t\tcloven-footed and another not; because these are differentiae of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"foot,\" since cloven-footedness is a kind of footedness.And thus we tend always to\n\t\t\t\t\tprogress until we come to the species which contain no differentiae.\n\t\t\t\t\tAt this point there will be just as many species of foot as there are\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiae, and the kinds of animals having feet will be equal in\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber to the differentiae. Then, if this is so, obviously the ultimate differentia will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe the substance and definition of the thing, since we need not state\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same things more than once in definitions, because this is\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperfluous.However, it does happen; for when we say \"footed two-footed animal\"\n\t\t\t\t\twe have simply said \"animal having feet, having two feet.\" And if we\n\t\t\t\t\tdivide this by its proper division, we shall be stating the same thing\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral times, as many times as there are differentiae.If, then, we keep on taking a differentia of a differentia, one of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, the last, will be the form and the substance. But if we proceed\n\t\t\t\t\twith reference to accidental qualitiese.g. if we divide\n\t\t\t\t\t\"that which has feet\" into white and blackthere will be as\n\t\t\t\t\tmany differentiae as there are divisions. It is therefore obvious that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe definition is the formula derived from the differentiae, and\n\t\t\t\t\tstrictly speaking from the last of them.This will be clear if we change the order of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch definitions, e.g. that of man, saying \"two-footed footed animal\";\n\t\t\t\t\tfor \"footed\" is superfluous when we have already said \"two-footed.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tBut there is no question of order in the substance; for how are we to\n\t\t\t\t\tthink of one part as posterior and the other prior?With regard, then, to definitions by division, let\n\t\t\t\t\tthis suffice as a preliminary statement of their nature. Since the subject of our inquiry is\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, let us return to it. Just as the substrate and the essence\n\t\t\t\t\tand the combination of these are called substance, so too is the\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal. With two of these we have already dealt, i.e. with the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence and the substrate; of the latter we have said that it\n\t\t\t\t\tunderlies in two senseseither being an individual thing (as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe animal underlies its attributes), or as matter underlies the\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality.The\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal also is thought by some to be in the truest sense\n\t\t\t\t\ta cause and a principle. Let us therefore proceed to discuss this\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion too; for it seems impossible that any universal term can be\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance.First, the substance of\n\t\t\t\t\tan individual is the substance which is peculiar to it and belongs to\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing else; whereas the universal is common; for by universal we\n\t\t\t\t\tmean that which by nature appertains to several things.Of what particular, then, will\n\t\t\t\t\tthe universal be the substance? Either of all or of none. But it\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot be the substance of all; while, if it is to be the substance of\n\t\t\t\t\tone, the rest also will be that one; because things whose substance is\n\t\t\t\t\tone have also one essence and are themselves one.Again, substance means that which is not predicated\n\t\t\t\t\tof a subject, whereas the universal is always predicated of some\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject.But perhaps although the\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal cannot be substance in the sense that essence is, it can be\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent in the essence, as \"animal\" can be present in \"man\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"horse.\"Then\n\t\t\t\t\tclearly there is in some sense a formula of the universal. It makes no\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferenceeven if\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is not a formula of everything that is in the substance; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal will be none the less the substance of something; e.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"man\" will be the substance of the man in whom it is present. Thus the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame thing will happen again; e.g. \"animal\" will be the substance of that in which it\n\t\t\t\t\tis present as peculiar to it.Again, it is impossible and\n\t\t\t\t\tabsurd that the individual or substance, if it is composed of\n\t\t\t\t\tanything, should be composed not of substances nor of the individual,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut of a quality; for then non-substance or quality will be prior to\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance or the individual. Which is impossible; for neither in\n\t\t\t\t\tformula nor in time nor in generation can the affections of substance\n\t\t\t\t\tbe prior to the substance, since then they would be\n\t\t\t\t\tseparable.Again, a substance will be present in\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Socrates,\" who is a\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance; so that it will be the substance of two things. And in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral it follows that if \"man\" and all terms used in this way are\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, none of the elements in the formula is the substance of\n\t\t\t\t\tanything, nor can it exist apart from the species or in anything else;\n\t\t\t\t\tI mean, e.g., that neither \"animal\" nor any other element of the\n\t\t\t\t\tformula can exist apart from the particular species.If we\n\t\t\t\t\tlook at the question from this standpoint it is obvious that no\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal attribute is substance; and it is also clear from the fact\n\t\t\t\t\tthat none of the common predicates means \"so-and-so,\" but \"such and-such.\" Otherwise amongst many other\n\t\t\t\t\tawkward consequences we have the \"third man.\"Again, it is clear in this way\n\t\t\t\t\ttoo. Substance can not consist of substances actually present in it;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor that which is actually two can never be actually one, whereas if\n\t\t\t\t\tit is potentially two it can be one. E.g., the double consists of two\n\t\t\t\t\thalvesthat is, potentially; for the actualization separates\n\t\t\t\t\tthe halves.Thus if\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance is one, it cannot consist of substances present in it even\n\t\t\t\t\tin this sense, as Democritus rightly observes; he says that it is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible for two to come from one, or one from two, because he\n\t\t\t\t\tidentifies substance with the atoms.Clearly then the same will also hold good in the case of number\n\t\t\t\t\t(assuming that number is a composition of units, as it is said to be\n\t\t\t\t\tby some); because either 2 is not 1, or there is not\n\t\t\t\t\t a unit in it.The consequence\n\t\t\t\t\tinvolves a difficulty; for if no substance can consist of universals,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they mean \"of such a kind,\" and not a particular thing; and if\n\t\t\t\t\tno substance can be actually composed of substances, every substance\n\t\t\t\t\twill be incomposite, and so there will be no formula of any\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance.But in\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint of fact it is universally held, and has been previously\n\t\t\t\t\tstated,that substance is the only or chief\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject of definition; but on this showing there is no definition even\n\t\t\t\t\tof substance. Then there can be no definition of anything; or rather\n\t\t\t\t\tin a sense there can, and in a sense cannot. What this means will be\n\t\t\t\t\tclearer from what follows later.From these same considerations\n\t\t\t\t\tit is clear also what consequence follows for those who maintain that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Forms are substances and separable, and who at the same time make\n\t\t\t\t\tthe species consist of the genus and the differentiae. If there are\n\t\t\t\t\tForms, and if \"animal\" is present in the man and the horse, it is\n\t\t\t\t\teither numerically one and the same with them, or not.(In formula they are clearly\n\t\t\t\t\tone; for in each case the speaker will enunciate the same formula.)\n\t\t\t\t\tIf, then, there is in some sense an Absolute Man, who is an individual\n\t\t\t\t\tand exists separately, then the constituents, e.g. \"animal\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"two-footed,\" must have an individual meaning and be separable and\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances. Hence there must be an Absolute Animal too.(i) Then if the \"animal\" which is in the horse and the man is one\n\t\t\t\t\tand the same, as you are one and the same with yourself, how can the one which in things that exist\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately be one, and why should not this \"animal\" also be separated\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom itself? Again, if it is to partake of \"two-footed\" and of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"many-footed,\" an impossibility follows; for contrary attributes will\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to it although it is one and individual.But if it does not, in what sense is it\n\t\t\t\t\tthat one calls an animal \"two-footed\" or \"terrestrial\"? Perhaps the\n\t\t\t\t\tterms are \"combined\" and \"in contact\" or \"mixed.\" But all these\n\t\t\t\t\texpressions are absurd.(2) \"But there\n\t\t\t\t\tis a different 'animal' in each species.\" Then there will be\n\t\t\t\t\tpractically an infinity of things of which \"animal\" is the substance,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince it is not in an accidental sense that \"man\" is derived from\n\t\t\t\t\t\"animal.\"Again, the\n\t\t\t\t\tAbsolute Animal will be a plurality. For (a) the \"animal\" in each\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies will be the substance of that species, since the species is\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled after it and no other thing. Otherwise \"man\" would be derived\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom that other thing, which would be the genus of \"man.\" (b) Further,\n\t\t\t\t\tall the constituents of \"man\" will be Ideas. Then, since nothing can\n\t\t\t\t\tbe the Idea of one thing and the substance of another (for this is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible),each\n\t\t\t\t\tand every \"animal\" in the various species will be the Absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tAnimal.Further, from what will\n\t\t\t\t\tthese Forms be derived, and how can they be derived from the Absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tAnimal? Or how can \"the animal,\" whose very essence is \"animal,\" exist\n\t\t\t\t\tapart from the Absolute Animal? And further, in the case of sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings both these and still more absurd consequences follow. If, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tthese consequences are impossible, clearly there are not Forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible things in the sense in which some hold that there\n\t\t\t\t\tare.Since\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance is of two kinds, the concrete thing and the formula (I mean\n\t\t\t\t\tthat one kind of substance is the formula in combination with the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter, and the other is the formula in its full sense), substances in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe former sense admit of destruction, for they also admit of\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration. But the formula does not admit of destruction in the sense\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is ever  destroyed, since neither does it so\n\t\t\t\t\tadmit of generation (for the essence of house is not generated, but\n\t\t\t\t\tonly the essence of  house); formulae\n\t\t\t\t\t , and , independently of\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration and destruction; for it has been shown that no one either generates or\n\t\t\t\t\tcreates them.For this\n\t\t\t\t\treason also there is no definition or demonstration of particular\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible substances, because they contain matter whose nature is such\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it can both exist and not exist. Hence all the individual\n\t\t\t\t\tinstances of them are perishable.If, then, the demonstration and definition of\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary truths requires scientific knowledge, and if, just as\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge cannot be sometimes knowledge and sometimes ignorance (it is\n\t\t\t\t\topinion that is of this nature), so too demonstration and definition\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot vary (it is opinion that is concerned with that which can be\n\t\t\t\t\totherwise than it is) then clearly there\n\t\t\t\t\tcan be neither definition nor demonstration of individual sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances.For (a)\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which perish are obscure to those who have knowledge of them\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they are removed from the sphere of their perception, and (b)\n\t\t\t\t\teven though their formulae are preserved in the soul, there will no\n\t\t\t\t\tlonger be either definition or demonstration of them. Therefore in\n\t\t\t\t\tcases relating to definition, when we are trying to define any\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual, we must not fail to realize that our definition may always\n\t\t\t\t\tbe upset; because it is impossible to define these things.Nor, indeed, can any Idea be defined; for the Idea is an individual,\n\t\t\t\t\tas they say, and separable; and the formula must consist of words, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe man who is defining must not coin a word, because it would not be\n\t\t\t\t\tcomprehensible. But the words which are in use are common to all the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which they denote; and so they must necessarily apply to\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else as well. E.g., if a man were to define you, he would\n\t\t\t\t\tsay that you are an animal which is lean or white or has some other\n\t\t\t\t\tattribute, which will apply to something else as well.And if it should be said that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is no reason why all the attributes separately should not belong\n\t\t\t\t\tto several things, and yet in combination belong to this alone, we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust reply, (1.) that they also belong to both the elements; e.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"two-footed animal\" belongs both to \"animal\" and to \"two-footed\" (and\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of eternal elements this is even necessarily so; since\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are prior to the compound, and parts of it.Indeed they are also separable, if the\n\t\t\t\t\tterm \"man\" is separablefor either neither can be separable,\n\t\t\t\t\tor both are so.If neither,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe genus will not exist apart from the species, or if it is so to\n\t\t\t\t\texist, so will the differentia); (2.) that \"animal\" and \"two-footed\"\n\t\t\t\t\tare prior in being to \"two-footed animal,\" and that which is prior to\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else is not destroyed together with it.Again,\n\t\t\t\t\tif the Ideas are composed of Ideas (for constituents are less\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposite than that which they compose), still the elements of which\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Idea is composed (e.g. \"animal\" and \"two-footed\") will have to be\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicated of many particulars. Otherwise, how can they be known? For\n\t\t\t\t\tthere would be an Idea which cannot be predicated of more than one\n\t\t\t\t\tthing. But this is not considered possible; every Idea is thought to\n\t\t\t\t\tadmit of participation.Thus, as we have said, the impossibility of\n\t\t\t\t\tdefining individuals is hard to realize when we are dealing with\n\t\t\t\t\teternal entities, especially in the case of such as are unique, e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sun and moon. For people go wrong not only by including in the\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition attributes on whose removal it will still be\n\t\t\t\t\tsune.g., \"that which goes round the earth,\" or\n\t\t\t\t\t\"night-hidden \" (for they suppose that if it stops or becomes\n\t\t\t\t\tvisible it will no longer be sun; but it is absurd that this\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be so, since \"the sun \"denotes a definite\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance)they also mention attributes which may apply to\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else; e.g., if another thing with those attributes comes\n\t\t\t\t\tinto being, clearly it will be a sun. The formula, then, is general;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut the sun was supposed to be an\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual, like Cleon or\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates.Why does not one of the exponents of the Ideas\n\t\t\t\t\tproduce a definition of them? If they were to try, it would become\n\t\t\t\t\tobvious that what we have just said is true.It is\n\t\t\t\t\tobvious that even of those things which are thought to be substances\n\t\t\t\t\tthe majority are potentialities; both the parts of living things (for\n\t\t\t\t\tnone of them has a separate substantial existence; and when they are\n\t\t\t\t\tseparated, although they still exist, they exist as matter), and\n\t\t\t\t\tearth, fire and air; for none of these is one \n\t\t\t\t\tthey are a mere aggregate before they are digested and some\n\t\t\t\t\tone thing is generated from them.It might be supposed very reasonably that the\n\t\t\t\t\tparts of living things and the corresponding parts of their vital\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple are both, i.e. exist both actually and potentially, because\n\t\t\t\t\tthey contain principles of motion derived from something in their\n\t\t\t\t\tjoints; and hence some animals live even when they are\n\t\t\t\t\tdivided. Nevertheless it is only potentially that all of them will\n\t\t\t\t\texist when they are one and continuous by nature and not by force or\n\t\t\t\t\tconcretion; for this sort of thing is malformation.And since \"unity\" has the same\n\t\t\t\t\tvariety of senses as \"being,\" and the substance of Unity is one, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthings whose substance is numerically one are numerically one,\n\t\t\t\t\tevidently neither Unity nor Being can be the substance of things, just\n\t\t\t\t\tas neither \"being an element\" or \"principle\" can be the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance;but we ask\n\t\t\t\t\twhat the principle is so that we may refer to something more\n\t\t\t\t\tintelligible.Now of these concepts Being\n\t\t\t\t\tand Unity are more nearly substance than are principle, element and\n\t\t\t\t\tcause; but not even the former are quite substance, since nothing else\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is common is substance; for substance belongs to nothing except\n\t\t\t\t\titself and that which contains it and of which it is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance.Again,\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity cannot exist in many places at the same time, but that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon is present in many things at the same time. Hence it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tthat no universal exists in separation apart from its particulars. The\n\t\t\t\t\texponents of the Forms are partly right in their account when they\n\t\t\t\t\tmake the Forms separate; that is, if the Forms are substances, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are also partly wrong, since by \"Form\" they mean the\n\t\t\t\t\t\"one-over-many.\"The reason for this is that they cannot explain what are the\n\t\t\t\t\timperishable substances of this kind which exist besides particular\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible substances; so they make them the same in kind as perishable\n\t\t\t\t\tthings (for these we know); i.e., they make \"Ideal Man\" and \"Ideal\n\t\t\t\t\tHorse,\" adding the word \"Ideal\" to the names of sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings.However, I\n\t\t\t\t\tpresume that even if we had never seen the stars, none\n\t\t\t\t\tthe less there would be eternal substances besides those which we\n\t\t\t\t\tknew; and so in the present case even if we cannot apprehend what they\n\t\t\t\t\tare, still there must be eternal substances of some kind.It is clear, then, both that no universal\n\t\t\t\t\tterm is substance and that no substance is composed of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances.As for what and what sort of thing we\n\t\t\t\t\tmean by substance, let us explain this by making, as it were, another\n\t\t\t\t\tfresh start. Perhaps in this way we shall also obtain some light upon\n\t\t\t\t\tthat kind of substance which exists in separation from sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances. Since, then, substance is a kind of principle and cause,\n\t\t\t\t\twe had better pursue our inquiry from this point.Now when we ask why a thing is, it is always in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsense \"why does A belong to B?\"To ask why the cultured man is a cultured man\n\t\t\t\t\tis to ask either, as we have said, why the man is cultured, or\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else. Now to ask why a thing is itself is no question;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause when we ask the reason of a thing the fact must first be\n\t\t\t\t\tevident; e.g., that the moon suffers eclipse;and \"because it is itself\" is the one\n\t\t\t\t\texplanation and reason which applies to all questions such as \"why is\n\t\t\t\t\tman man?\" or \"why is the cultured person cultured?\" (unless one were\n\t\t\t\t\tto say that each thing is indivisible from itself, and that this is\n\t\t\t\t\twhat \"being one\" really means);but this, besides being a general answer, is a\n\t\t\t\t\tsummary one. We may, however, ask why a man is\n\t\t\t\t\tan animal of such-and-such a kind.It is clear, then, that we are not asking why\n\t\t\t\t\the who is a man is a man; therefore we are asking why A, which is\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicated of B, belongs to B. (The fact that A does belong to B must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe evident, for if this is not so, the question is pointless.) E.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Why does it thunder?\" means \"why is a noise produced in the clouds?\"\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the true form of the question is one thing predicated in this way\n\t\t\t\t\tof another.Or again, \"why\n\t\t\t\t\tare these things, e.g. bricks and stones, a house?\" Clearly then we\n\t\t\t\t\tare inquiring for the cause (i.e., to speak abstractly, the essence);\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is in the case of some things, e.g. house or bed, the\n\t\t\t\t\t , and in others the prime moverfor this\n\t\t\t\t\talso is a cause. We look for the latter kind of cause in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration and destruction, but for the former also in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\texistence.What we are now looking for is most\n\t\t\t\t\tobscure when one term is not predicated of another; e.g. when we inquire what man is; because the\n\t\t\t\t\texpression is a simple one not analyzed into subject and attributes.\n\t\t\t\t\tWe must make the question articulate before we ask it; otherwise we\n\t\t\t\t\tget something which shares the nature of a pointless and of a definite\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion.Now since\n\t\t\t\t\twe must know that the fact actually exists, it is surely clear that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe question is \"why is the  so-and-so?\" e.g. \"why\n\t\t\t\t\tare these materials a house?\" Because the essence of house is present\n\t\t\t\t\tin them. And this matter, or the body containing this particular form,\n\t\t\t\t\tis man. Thus what we are seeking is the cause (i.e. the form) in\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue of which the matter is a definite thing; and this is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance of the thing.Clearly then in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case of simple entities inquiry and explanation are impossible; in\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch cases there is a different mode of inquiry.Now\n\t\t\t\t\tsince that which is composed of something in such a way that the whole\n\t\t\t\t\tis a unity; not as an aggregate is a unity, but as a syllable isthe syllable is not the letters, nor\n\t\t\t\t\tis BA the same as B and A; nor is flesh fire and earth; because after\n\t\t\t\t\tdissolution the compounds, e.g. flesh or the syllable, no longer\n\t\t\t\t\texist; but the letters exist, and so do fire and earth.Therefore the syllable is some\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular thing; not merely the letters, vowel and consonant, but\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else besides. And flesh is not merely fire and earth, or hot\n\t\t\t\t\tand cold, but something else besides.Since then this something else must be either\n\t\t\t\t\tan element or composed of elements,(a) if it is an element, the same argument applies\n\t\t\t\t\tagain; for flesh will be composed of  and fire and\n\t\t\t\t\tearth, and again of another element, so that there will be an infinite\n\t\t\t\t\tregression. And (b) if it is composed of elements, clearly it is\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed not of one (otherwise it will itself be that element) but of\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral; so that we shall use the same argument in this case as about\n\t\t\t\t\tthe flesh or the syllable.It would seem, however, that this \"something else\" is something that\n\t\t\t\t\tis not an element, but is the cause that  matter is\n\t\t\t\t\tflesh and  matter a syllable, and similarly in other\n\t\t\t\t\tcases.And this is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe substance of each thing, for it is the primary cause of its\n\t\t\t\t\texistence. And since, although some things are not substances, all\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances are constituted in accordance with and by nature, substance\n\t\t\t\t\twould seem to be this \"nature,\" which is not an element but a\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple.

We have said that the objects of our inquiry are the causes and\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples and elements of substances. Now some substances are agreed\n\t\t\t\t\tupon by all; but about others certain thinkers have stated individual\n\t\t\t\t\ttheories.Those about\n\t\t\t\t\twhich there is agreement are natural substances: e.g. fire, earth,\n\t\t\t\t\twater, air and all the other simple bodies; next, plants and their\n\t\t\t\t\tparts, and animals and the parts of animals; and finally the sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tuniverse and its parts; and certain thinkers individually include as\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances the Forms and the objects of mathematics.And arguments show that there are yet other\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances: the essence and the substrate. Again, from another point of view, the genus is\n\t\t\t\t\tmore nearly substance than the species, and the universal than the\n\t\t\t\t\tparticulars;\n\t\t\t\t\tand there is a close connection between the universal and genus and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Ideas, for they are thought to be substance on the same\n\t\t\t\t\tgrounds.And since the essence is substance, and definition is the formula of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe essence, we have therefore systematically examined definition and\n\t\t\t\t\tessential predication. And since\n\t\t\t\t\tthe definition is a formula, and the formula has parts,we have been compelled to\n\t\t\t\t\tinvestigate \"parts,\" and to discover what things are parts of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, and what are not; and whether the parts of the substance\n\t\t\t\t\tare also parts of the definition. Further, then, neither the universal nor the genus\n\t\t\t\t\tis substance.As for the Ideas and the objects of\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematics (for some say that these exist apart from sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances) we must consider them later. But now let us proceed to\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscuss those substances which are generally accepted as\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch.Now these are the sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances, and all sensible substances contain matter.And the substrate is substance;\n\t\t\t\t\tin one sense matter (by matter I mean that which is not actually, but\n\t\t\t\t\tis potentially, an individual thing); and in another the formula and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe specific shape (which is an individual thing and is theoretically\n\t\t\t\t\tseparable); and thirdly there is the combination of the two, which\n\t\t\t\t\talone admits of generation and destruction,\n\t\t\t\t\tand is separable in an unqualified sensefor of substances\n\t\t\t\t\tin the sense of formula some are separable and some are not.That matter is also substance is evident; for in all opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tprocesses of change there is something that underlies those processes;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g., if the change is of  , that which is now in\n\t\t\t\t\tone place and subsequently in another; and if the change is of\n\t\t\t\t\t , that which is now of such-and-such a\n\t\t\t\t\tsize, and subsequently smaller or greater; and if the change is of\n\t\t\t\t\t , that which is now healthy and\n\t\t\t\t\tsubsequently diseased. Similarly, if the change is in respect of\n\t\t\t\t\t , there is something which is now in course\n\t\t\t\t\tof generation, and subsequently in course of destruction, and which is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe underlying substrate, now as  individual thing,\n\t\t\t\t\tand subsequently as deprived of its individuality. In this last\n\t\t\t\t\tprocess of change the others are involved, but in either one or\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo\n\t\t\t\t\tof the others it is not involved; for it does not necessarily follow\n\t\t\t\t\tthat if a thing contains matter that admits of change of place, it\n\t\t\t\t\talso contains matter that is generable and destructible.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe difference between absolute and qualified generation has been\n\t\t\t\t\texplained in the .Since\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance in the sense of substrate or matter is admittedly substance,\n\t\t\t\t\tand this is potential substance, it remains to explain the nature of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe actual substance of sensible things. Now Democritus apparently assumes three differences\n\t\t\t\t\tin substance; for he says that the underlying body is one and the same\n\t\t\t\t\tin material, but differs in figure, i.e. shape; or inclination, i.e.\n\t\t\t\t\tposition; or intercontact, i.e. arrangement.But evidently there are many differences; e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tsome things are defined by the way in which their materials are\n\t\t\t\t\tcombined, as, for example, things which are unified by mixture, as\n\t\t\t\t\thoney-water; or by ligature, as a faggot; or by glue, as a book; or by\n\t\t\t\t\tclamping, as a chest; or by more than one of these methods. Other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are defined by their position, e.g. threshold and lintel (for\n\t\t\t\t\tthese differ in being situated in a particular way);and others by place <or\n\t\t\t\t\tdirection>, e.g. the winds; others by time, e.g. dinner and\n\t\t\t\t\tbreakfast; and others by the attributes peculiar to sensible things,\n\t\t\t\t\te.g. hardness and softness, density and rarity, dryness and humidity.\n\t\t\t\t\tSome are distinguished by some of these differences, and others by all\n\t\t\t\t\tof them; and in general some by excess and some by defect.Hence it is clear that \"is\" has the same number of senses; for a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing \"is\" a threshold because it is situated in a particular way, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"to be a threshold\" means to be situated in this particular way, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"to be ice\" means to be condensed in this particular way. Some things\n\t\t\t\t\thave their being defined in all these ways: by being partly mixed,\n\t\t\t\t\tpartly blended, partly bound, partly condensed, and partly subjected\n\t\t\t\t\tto all the other different processes; as, for example, a hand or a\n\t\t\t\t\tfoot.We must\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore comprehend the various kinds of differencesfor\n\t\t\t\t\tthese will be principles of beingi.e. the differences in\n\t\t\t\t\tdegree, or in density and rarity, and in other such modifications, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are all instances of excess and defect.And if anything differs in shape or in\n\t\t\t\t\tsmoothness or roughness, all these are differences in straightness and\n\t\t\t\t\tcurvature. For some things mixture will constitute being, and the opposite state not-being.From this it is evident that if substance is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of the existence of each thing, we must look among these\n\t\t\t\t\t\"differences\" for the cause of the being of each thing.No one of them, nor the\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination of any two of them, is substance, but nevertheless each\n\t\t\t\t\tone of them contains something analogous to substance. And just as in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case of substances that which is predicated of the matter is the\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality itself, so in the other kinds of definition it is the\n\t\t\t\t\tnearest approximation to actuality. E.g., if we have to define a\n\t\t\t\t\tthreshold, we shall call it \"a piece of wood or stone placed in\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch-and-such a way\"; and we should define a house as \"bricks and\n\t\t\t\t\ttimber arranged in such-and-such a way\";or again in some cases there is the final\n\t\t\t\t\tcause as well. And if we are defining ice, we shall describe it as\n\t\t\t\t\t\"water congealed or condensed in such-and-such a way\"; and a harmony\n\t\t\t\t\tis \"such-and-such a combination of high and low\"; and similarly in the\n\t\t\t\t\tother cases.From this it is evident\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the actuality or formula is different in the case of different\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter; for in some cases it is a combination, in others a mixture,\n\t\t\t\t\tand in others some other of the modes which we have\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribed.Hence in\n\t\t\t\t\tdefining the nature of a house, those who describe it as stones,\n\t\t\t\t\tbricks and wood, describe the potential house, since these things are\n\t\t\t\t\tits matter; those who describe it as \"a receptacle for containing\n\t\t\t\t\tgoods and bodies,\" or something else to the same effect, describe its\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality; but those who combine these two definitions describe the\n\t\t\t\t\tthird kind of substance, that which is composed of matter and\n\t\t\t\t\tform.For it would\n\t\t\t\t\tseem that the formula which involves the differentiae is that of the\n\t\t\t\t\tform and the actuality,while that which involves the constituent parts is rather that of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe matter. The same is true of the kind of definitions which\n\t\t\t\t\tArchytas used to accept; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are definitions of the combined matter and form. E.g., what is\n\t\t\t\t\t\"windlessness?\" Stillness in a large extent of air; for the air is the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter, and the stillness is the actuality and substance.What is a calm? Levelness of\n\t\t\t\t\tsea. The sea is the material substrate, and the levelness is the\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality or form.From the foregoing\n\t\t\t\t\taccount it is clear what sensible substance is, and in what sense it\n\t\t\t\t\texists; either as matter, or as form and actuality, or thirdly as the\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination of the two.We must not fail to realize\n\t\t\t\t\tthat sometimes it is doubtful whether a name denotes the composite\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance or the actuality and the forme.g. whether \"house\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdenotes the composite thing, \"a covering made of bricks and stones\n\t\t\t\t\tarranged in such-and-such a way,\" or the actuality and form, \"a\n\t\t\t\t\tcovering\"; and whether \"line\" means \"duality in length\" or\n\t\t\t\t\t\"duality\"; and whether \"animal\"\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans \"a soul in a body\" or \"a soul\"; for the soul is the substance\n\t\t\t\t\tand actuality of some body.The term \"animal\" would be applicable to both cases; not as being\n\t\t\t\t\tdefined by one formula, but as relating to one concept. These\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinctions are of importance from another point of view, but\n\t\t\t\t\tunimportant for the investigation of sensible substance; because the essence belongs to the form and the\n\t\t\t\t\tactualization.Soul\n\t\t\t\t\tand essence of soul are the same, but man and essence of man are not,\n\t\t\t\t\tunless the soul is also to be called man; and although this is so in\n\t\t\t\t\tone sense, it is not so in another.It\n\t\t\t\t\tappears, then, upon inquiry into the matter, that a syllable is not derived from the phonetic\n\t\t\t\t\telements plus combination, nor is a house bricks plus combination. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is true; for the combination or mixture is not derived from the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings of which it is a combination or mixture,nor, similarly, is any other of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\"differences.\" E.g., if the threshold is defined by its position, the\n\t\t\t\t\tposition is not derived from the threshold, but rather vice versa.\n\t\t\t\t\tNor, indeed, is man \"animal\"  \"two-footed\"; there\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be something which exists besides these, if they are matter; but\n\t\t\t\t\tit is neither an element nor derived from an element, but the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance; and those who offer the definition given above are omitting\n\t\t\t\t\tthis and describing the matter.If, then, this something else is the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\ta man's being, and this is his substance, they will not be stating his\n\t\t\t\t\tactual substance.Now the substance must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe either eternal or perishable without ever being in process of\n\t\t\t\t\tperishing, and generated without ever being in process of generation.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt has been clearly demonstrated elsewhere that no one generates or creates the form; it\n\t\t\t\t\tis the individual thing that is created, and the compound that is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated.But\n\t\t\t\t\twhether the substances of perishable things are separable or not is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot yet at all clear; only\n\t\t\t\t\tit is clear that this is impossible in some cases,i.e. in the case of all things which\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot exist apart from the particular instances; e.g. house or\n\t\t\t\t\timplement. Probably, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tneither these things themselves, nor anything else which is not\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally composed, are substances; for their nature is the only\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance which one can assume in the case of perishable\n\t\t\t\t\tthings.Hence the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty which perplexed the followers of Antisthenes and others similarly unlearned has a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain application; I mean the difficulty that it is impossible to\n\t\t\t\t\tdefine  a thing is (for the definition, they say, is\n\t\t\t\t\ta lengthy formula), but it  possible actually to teach\n\t\t\t\t\tothers what a thing ; e.g., we cannot say\n\t\t\t\t\t silver is, but we can say that it is like\n\t\t\t\t\ttin.Hence there can\n\t\t\t\t\tbe definition and formula of one kind of substance, i.e. the\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposite, whether it is sensible or intelligible; but not of its\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary constituents, since the defining formula denotes something\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicated of something, and this must be partly of the nature of\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter and partly of the nature of form.It is also obvious\n\t\t\t\t\tthat, if numbers are in any sense substances, they are such in this\n\t\t\t\t\tsense, and not, as some describe them, aggregates\n\t\t\t\t\tof units. For (a) the definition is a kind of number, since it is\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisible, and divisible into indivisible parts (for formulae are not\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite); and number is of this nature.And (b) just as when any element which\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposes the number is subtracted or added, it is no longer the same\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber but a different one, however small the subtraction or addition\n\t\t\t\t\tis; so neither the definition nor the essence will\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinue to exist if something is subtracted from or added to it. And\n\t\t\t\t\t(c) a number must be something in virtue of which it is a unity\n\t\t\t\t\t(whereas our opponents cannot say what makes it one); that is, if it\n\t\t\t\t\tis a unity.For either it\n\t\t\t\t\tis not a unity but a kind of aggregate, or if it is a unity, we must\n\t\t\t\t\texplain what makes a unity out of a plurality. And the definition is a\n\t\t\t\t\tunity; but similarly they cannot explain the definition either. This\n\t\t\t\t\tis a natural consequence, for the same reason applies to both, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance is a unity in the way which we have explained, and not as\n\t\t\t\t\tsome thinkers say: e.g. because it is a kind of unit or point; but\n\t\t\t\t\teach substance is a kind of actuality and nature.Also (d) just as a number does not\n\t\t\t\t\tadmit of variation in degree, so neither does substance in the sense\n\t\t\t\t\tof form; if any substance does admit of this, it is substance in\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination with matter.Let this suffice as a detailed account of the\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration and destruction of so-called substances, in what sense they\n\t\t\t\t\tare possible and in what sense they are not; and of the reference of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings to number.As regards material substance, we must\n\t\t\t\t\tnot fail to realize that even if all things are derived from the same\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary cause, or from the same things as primary causes; i.e. even if all things that are\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated have the same matter for their first principle, nevertheless\n\t\t\t\t\teach thing has some matter peculiar to it; e.g., \"the sweet\" or \"the\n\t\t\t\t\tviscous\" is the proximate matter of mucus, and \"the bitter\" or some\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch thing is that of bilealthough probably mucus and bile are derived from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same ultimate matter.The result is that there is more than one matter of the same thing,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen one thing is the matter of the other; e.g., mucus is derived from\n\t\t\t\t\t\"the viscous\"; and from \"the sweet,\" if \"the viscous\" is derived from\n\t\t\t\t\t\"the sweet\"; and from bile, by the analysis of bile into its ultimate\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter. For there are two senses in which X comes from Y; either\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause X will be found further on than Y in the process of\n\t\t\t\t\tdevelopment, or because X is produced when Y is analyzed into its\n\t\t\t\t\toriginal constituents.And\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent things can be generated by the moving cause when the matter\n\t\t\t\t\tis one and the same, e.g. a chest and a bed from wood. But some\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent things must necessarily have different matter; e.g., a saw\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot be generated from wood, nor does this lie in the power of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmoving cause, for it cannot make a saw of wool or wood.If, then, it is possible to make the same thing from different\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter, clearly the art, i.e. the moving principle, is the same; for\n\t\t\t\t\tif both the matter and the mover are different, so too is the\n\t\t\t\t\tproduct.So whenever we inquire\n\t\t\t\t\twhat the cause is, since there are causes in several senses, we must\n\t\t\t\t\tstate all the possible causes.E.g., what is the material cause of a man? The\n\t\t\t\t\tmenses. What is the moving cause? The semen. What is the formal cause?\n\t\t\t\t\tThe essence. What is the final cause? The end. (But\n\t\t\t\t\tperhaps both the latter are the same.) We must, however, state the\n\t\t\t\t\tmost proximate causes. What is the matter? Not fire or earth, but the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter proper to man.Thus as regards generable natural\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances we must proceed in this manner, if we are to proceed\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrectly; that is, if the causes are these and of this number, and it\n\t\t\t\t\tis necessary to know the causes. But in the case of substances which\n\t\t\t\t\tthough natural are eternal the principle is different. For presumably\n\t\t\t\t\tsome of them have no matter; or no matter of this kind, but only such\n\t\t\t\t\tas is spatially mobile.Moreover, things which exist by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature but are not substances have no matter; their substrate is their\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance. E.g., what is the cause of an eclipse; what is its matter?\n\t\t\t\t\tIt has none; it is the moon which is affected. What is the moving\n\t\t\t\t\tcause which destroys the light? The earth. There is probably no final\n\t\t\t\t\tcause. The formal cause is the formula; but this is obscure unless it\n\t\t\t\t\tincludes the efficient cause.E.g., what is an eclipse? A privation of\n\t\t\t\t\tlight; and if we add \"caused by the earth's intervention,\" this is the\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition which includes the <efficient> cause. In the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase of sleep it is not clear what it is that is proximately affected.\n\t\t\t\t\tIs it the animal? Yes; but in respect of what, and of what\n\t\t\t\t\tproximately? The heart, or some other part. Again, by what is it\n\t\t\t\t\taffected? Again, what is the affection which affects that part, and\n\t\t\t\t\tnot the whole animal? A particular kind of immobility?Yes; but in virtue of what\n\t\t\t\t\taffection of the proximate subject is it this?Since\n\t\t\t\t\tsome things both are and are not, without being liable to generation\n\t\t\t\t\tand destructione.g. points, if they exist at all; and in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral the forms and shapes of things (because white does not come to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe, but the wood becomes white, since everything which comes into\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing comes from something and becomes something)not all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe contraries can be generated from each other.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhite is not generated from black in the same way as a white man is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated from a black man; nor does everything contain matter, but\n\t\t\t\t\tonly such things as admit of generation and transformation into each\n\t\t\t\t\tother.And such\n\t\t\t\t\tthings as, without undergoing a process of change, both are and are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot, have no matter.There is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty in the question how the matter of the individual is related\n\t\t\t\t\tto the contraries. E.g., if the body is potentially healthy, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary of health is disease, is the body potentially both healthy\n\t\t\t\t\tand diseased? And is water potentially wine and vinegar? Probably in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe one case it is the matter in respect of the positive state and\n\t\t\t\t\tform, and in the other case in respect of privation and degeneration\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is contrary to its proper nature.There is also a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty as to why wine is not the matter of vinegar, nor\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially vinegar (though vinegar comes from it), and why the living\n\t\t\t\t\tman is not potentially dead. In point of fact they are not; their\n\t\t\t\t\tdegeneration is accidental, and the actual\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter of the living body becomes by degeneration the potentiality and\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter of the dead body, and water the matter of vinegar; for the one\n\t\t\t\t\tbecomes the other just as day becomes night.All things which change reciprocally in this\n\t\t\t\t\tway must return into the matter; e.g., if a living thing is generated\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom a dead one, it must first become the matter, and then a living\n\t\t\t\t\tthing; and vinegar must first become water, and then wine.With regard to the difficulty which we have described in\n\t\t\t\t\tconnection with definitions and numbers, what is the cause of the\n\t\t\t\t\tunification? In all things which have a plurality of parts, and which\n\t\t\t\t\tare not a total aggregate but a whole of some sort distinct from the\n\t\t\t\t\tparts, there is some  ; inasmuch as even in bodies\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes contact is the cause of their unity, and sometimes viscosity\n\t\t\t\t\tor some other such quality.But a definition is  account, not by connection,\n\t\t\t\t\tlike the , but because it is a definition of one thing.What is it, then, that makes \"man\" one\n\t\t\t\t\tthing, and why does it make him one thing and not many, e.g. \"animal\"\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"two-footed,\" especially if, as some say, there is an Idea of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"animal\" and an Idea of \"two-footed\"?Why are not these Ideas \"man,\" and why should\n\t\t\t\t\tnot man exist by participation, not in any \"man,\" but in two Ideas,\n\t\t\t\t\tthose of \"animal\" and \"two-footed\"?And in general \"man\" will be not one, but two\n\t\t\t\t\tthings\"animal\" and \"two-footed.\" Evidently if we proceed in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis way, as it is usual to define and explain, it will be impossible\n\t\t\t\t\tto answer and solve the difficulty.But if, as we maintain, man is part matter and\n\t\t\t\t\tpart formthe matter being potentially, and the form\n\t\t\t\t\tactually man, the point which we are investigating will no\n\t\t\t\t\tlonger seem to be a difficulty. For this difficulty is just the same\n\t\t\t\t\tas we should have if the definition of X were \"round bronze\"; for this name\n\t\t\t\t\twould give a clue to the formula, so that the question becomes \"what\n\t\t\t\t\tis the cause of the unification of 'round' and 'bronze'?\"The difficulty is no longer\n\t\t\t\t\tapparent, because the one is matter and the other form. What then is\n\t\t\t\t\tit (apart from the active cause) which causes that which exists\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially to exist actually in things which admit of generation?\n\t\t\t\t\tThere  no other cause of the potential sphere's being\n\t\t\t\t\tan actual sphere; this was the essence of each.Some\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter is intelligible and some sensible, and part of the formula is\n\t\t\t\t\talways matter and part actuality; e.g., the circle is a plane\n\t\t\t\t\tfigure. But such thing as have no matter, neither intelligible nor\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible, are ipso facto each one of them essentially something one;\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as they are essentially something\n\t\t\t\t\texistent: an individual substance, a quality, or a quantity. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tneither \"existent\" nor \"one\" is present in their definitions. And\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir essence is ipso facto something one, just as it is something\n\t\t\t\t\texistent.Hence also\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is no other cause of the unity of any of these things, or of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir existence; for each one of them is one and \"existent\" not\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause it is contained in the genus \"being\" or \"unity,\" nor because\n\t\t\t\t\tthese genera exist separately apart from their particulars, but ipso\n\t\t\t\t\tfacto.It is because of this difficulty that some\n\t\t\t\t\tthinkers speak of \"participation,\" and raise the question of\n\t\t\t\t\twhat is the cause of participation, and what participation means; and\n\t\t\t\t\tothers speak of \"communion\"; e.g., Lycophron says that\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge is a communion of the soul with \"knowing\"; and others call\n\t\t\t\t\tlife a combination or connection of soul with body.The same argument, however, applies in\n\t\t\t\t\tevery case; for \"being healthy\" will be the \"communion\" or\n\t\t\t\t\t\"connection\" or \"combination\" of soul and health; and \"being a bronze\n\t\t\t\t\ttriangle\" a \"combination\" of bronze and triangle; and \"being white\" a\n\t\t\t\t\t\"combination\" of surface and whiteness. The reason for this is that\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople look for a unifying formula, and a difference, between\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality and actuality.But, as we have said, the proximate matter and the shape are one\n\t\t\t\t\tand the same; the one existing potentially, and the other\n\t\t\t\t\tactually.Therefore to\n\t\t\t\t\task the cause of their unity is like asking the cause of unity in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral; for each individual thing is one, and the potential and the\n\t\t\t\t\tactual are in a sense one. Thus there is no cause other than whatever\n\t\t\t\t\tinitiates the development from potentiality to actuality. And such\n\t\t\t\t\tthings as have no matter are all, without qualification, essential\n\t\t\t\t\tunities."}}, {"@n": "9", "@type": "Book", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1045b", "@unit": "section"},

For it is from the concept of substance that all the\n\t\t\t\t\tother modes of being take their meaning; both quantity and quality and\n\t\t\t\t\tall other such terms; for they will all involve the concept of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, as we stated it in the beginning of our discussion.And since the senses of being are\n\t\t\t\t\tanalyzable not only into\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance or quality or quantity, but also in accordance with\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality and actuality and function, let us also gain a clear\n\t\t\t\t\tunderstanding about potentiality and actuality; and first about\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality in the sense which is most proper to the word, but not\n\t\t\t\t\tmost useful for our present purpose for\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality and actuality extend beyond the sphere of terms which\n\t\t\t\t\tonly refer to motion.When\n\t\t\t\t\twe have discussed this sense of potentiality we will, in the course of\n\t\t\t\t\tour definitions of actuality, explain the others also.We have made it plain elsewhere that \"potentiality\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"can\" have several senses.All senses which are merely equivocal may be dismissed; for some are\n\t\t\t\t\tused by analogy, as in geometry, and we\n\t\t\t\t\tcall things possible or impossible because they \"are\" or \"are not\" in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome particular way. But the potentialities which conform to the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttype are all principles, and derive their meaning from one primary\n\t\t\t\t\tsense of potency, which is the source of change in some other thing,\n\t\t\t\t\tor in the same thing  other.One kind of potentiality is the power of being affected; the\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple in the patient itself which initiates a passive change in it\n\t\t\t\t\tby the action of some other thing, or of itself  other. Another is a positive state of impassivity in respect\n\t\t\t\t\tof deterioration or destruction by something else or by itself  something else; i.e. by a transformatory\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciplefor all these definitions contain the formula of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe primary sense of potentiality.Again, all these potentialities are so called\n\t\t\t\t\teither because they merely act or are acted upon in a particular way,\n\t\t\t\t\tor because they do so  . Hence in their formulae also\n\t\t\t\t\tthe formulae of potentiality in the senses previously described are\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent in some degree.Clearly, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tin one sense the potentiality for acting and being acted upon is\n\t\t\t\t\tone(for a thing is\n\t\t\t\t\t\"capable\" both because it itself possesses the power of being acted\n\t\t\t\t\tupon, and also because something else has the power of being acted\n\t\t\t\t\tupon by it);and in another\n\t\t\t\t\tsense it is not; for it is partly in the patient (for it is because it\n\t\t\t\t\tcontains a certain principle, and because even the matter is a kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple, that the patient is acted upon; i.e., one thing is acted\n\t\t\t\t\tupon by another: oily stuff is inflammable, and stuff which yields in\n\t\t\t\t\ta certain way is breakable, and similarly in other\n\t\t\t\t\tcases)and\n\t\t\t\t\tpartly in the agent; e.g. heat and the art of building: the former in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which produces heat, and the latter in that which builds. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tin so far as it is a natural unity, nothing is acted upon by itself;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause it is one, and not a separate thing.\"Incapacity\" and \"the incapable\" is the privation\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to \"capacity\" in this sense; so that every \"capacity\" has a\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary incapacity for producing the same result in respect of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame subject.Privation has several sensesit is applied (1.) to anything which\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not possess a certain attribute; (2.) to that which would\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally possess it, but does not; either (a) in general, or (b) when\n\t\t\t\t\tit would naturally possess it; and either (1) in a particular way,\n\t\t\t\t\te.g. entirely, or (2) in any way at all. And in some cases if things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich would naturally possess some attribute lack it as the result of\n\t\t\t\t\tconstraint, we say that they are \"deprived.\"Since\n\t\t\t\t\tsome of these principles are inherent in inanimate things, and others\n\t\t\t\t\tin animate things and in the soul and in the rational part of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsoul, it is clear that some of the potencies\n\t\t\t\t\talso will be irrational and some rational. Hence all arts, i.e. the\n\t\t\t\t\tproductive sciences, are potencies; because they are principles of\n\t\t\t\t\tchange in another thing, or in the artist himself  other.Every rational potency admits\n\t\t\t\t\tequally of contrary results, but irrational potencies admit of one\n\t\t\t\t\tresult only. E.g., heat can only produce heat, but medical science can\n\t\t\t\t\tproduce disease and health. The reason of this is that science is a\n\t\t\t\t\trational account, and the same account explains both the thing and its\n\t\t\t\t\tprivation, though not in the same way; and in one sense it applies to\n\t\t\t\t\tboth, and in another sense rather to the actual fact.Therefore such sciences must\n\t\t\t\t\ttreat of contrariesessentially of the one, and\n\t\t\t\t\tnon-essentially of the other; for the rational account also applies\n\t\t\t\t\tessentially to the one, but to the other in a kind of accidental way,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince it is by negation and removal that it throws light on the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary. For the contrary is the primary privation, and this is the removal of that to\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it is contrary.And since contrary attributes cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\tinduced in the same subject, and science is a potency which depends\n\t\t\t\t\tupon the possession of a rational formula, and the soul contains a\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple of motion, it follows that whereas \"the salutary\" can only\n\t\t\t\t\tproduce health, and \"the calefactory\" only heat, and \"the frigorific\"\n\t\t\t\t\tonly cold,the scientific\n\t\t\t\t\tman can produce both contrary results.For the rational account includes both, though\n\t\t\t\t\tnot in the same way; and it is in the soul, which contains a principle\n\t\t\t\t\tof motion, and will therefore, by means of the same principle, set\n\t\t\t\t\tboth processes in motion, by linking them with the same rational\n\t\t\t\t\taccount. Hence things which have a rational potency produce results\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to those of things whose potency is irrational; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe results of the former are included under one principle, the\n\t\t\t\t\trational account.It is\n\t\t\t\t\tevident also that whereas the power of merely producing (or suffering)\n\t\t\t\t\ta given effect is implied in the power of producing that effect\n\t\t\t\t\t , the contrary is not always true; for that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich produces an effect well must also produce it, but that which\n\t\t\t\t\tmerely produces a given effect does not necessarily produce it\n\t\t\t\t\twell.There are some, e.g. the Megaric school, who say that a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing only has potency when it functions, and that when it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tfunctioning it has no potency. E.g., they say that a man who is not\n\t\t\t\t\tbuilding cannot build, but only the man who is building, and at the\n\t\t\t\t\tmoment when he is building; and similarly in the other\n\t\t\t\t\tcases.It is not\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to see the absurd consequences of this theory. Obviously a\n\t\t\t\t\tman will not be a builder unless he is building, because \"to be a\n\t\t\t\t\tbuilder\" is \"to be capable of building\"; and the same will be true of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other arts.If,\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, it is impossible to possess these arts without learning\n\t\t\t\t\tthem at some time and having grasped them, and\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible not to possess them without having lost them at some time\n\t\t\t\t\t(through forgetfulness or some affection or the lapse of time; not, of\n\t\t\t\t\tcourse, through the destruction of the object of the art, because it exists always), when the artist ceases to\n\t\t\t\t\tpractice his art, he will not possess it;and if he immediately starts building again,\n\t\t\t\t\thow will he have re-acquired the art?The same is true of inanimate things. Neither the cold nor the hot\n\t\t\t\t\tnor the sweet nor in general any sensible thing will exist unless we\n\t\t\t\t\tare perceiving it (and so the result will be that they are affirming\n\t\t\t\t\tProtagoras' theory). Indeed, nothing will have the faculty of sensation\n\t\t\t\t\tunless it is perceiving, i.e. actually employing the\n\t\t\t\t\tfaculty.If, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is blind which has not sight, though it would naturally have it,\n\t\t\t\t\tand when it would naturally have it, and while it still exists, the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame people will be blind many times a day; and deaf too.Further, if that which is deprived of its\n\t\t\t\t\tpotency is incapable, that which is not happening will be incapable of\n\t\t\t\t\thappening; and he who says that that which is incapable of happening\n\t\t\t\t\t or , will be in error, for\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is what \"incapable\" meant.Thus these theories do away with both motion and generation; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is standing will always stand, and that which is sitting\n\t\t\t\t\twill always sit; because if it is sitting it will not get up, since it\n\t\t\t\t\tis impossible that anything which is incapable of getting up should\n\t\t\t\t\tget up.Since, then, we\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot maintain this, obviously potentiality and actuality are\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent. But these theories make potentiality and actuality\n\t\t\t\t\tidentical;hence it is\n\t\t\t\t\tno small thing that they are trying to abolish.Thus it is possible that a thing may be capable of\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing and yet not be, and capable of not being and yet be; and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly in the other categories that which is capable of walking may\n\t\t\t\t\tnot walk, and that which is capable of not walking may walk.A thing is capable of doing\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething if there is nothing impossible in its having the actuality\n\t\t\t\t\tof that of which it is said to have the potentiality. I mean, e.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat if a thing is capable of sitting and is not prevented from\n\t\t\t\t\tsitting, there is nothing impossible in its actually sitting; and\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarly if it is capable of being moved or moving or standing or\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking to stand or being or becoming or not being or not\n\t\t\t\t\tbecoming.The term \"actuality,\" with its\n\t\t\t\t\timplication of \"complete reality,\" has been extended from motions, to\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it properly belongs, to other things; for it is agreed that\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality is properly motion.Hence people do not invest non-existent things\n\t\t\t\t\twith motion, although they do invest them with certain other\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicates. E.g., they say that non-existent things are conceivable\n\t\t\t\t\tand desirable, but not that they are in motion. This is because,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough these things do not exist actually, they will exist actually;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor some non-existent things exist\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially; yet they do not exist, because they do not exist in\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete reality.Now if, as we have said, that is\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible which does not involve an impossibility, obviously it cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tbe true to say that so-and-so is possible, but will not be, this view\n\t\t\t\t\tentirely loses sight of the instances of impossibility. I mean, suppose that\n\t\t\t\t\tsomeonei.e. the sort of man who does not take the\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible into accountwere to say that it is possible to\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasure the diagonal of a square, but that it will not be measured,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause there is nothing to prevent a thing which is capable of being\n\t\t\t\t\tor coming to be from neither being nor being likely ever to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe.But from our\n\t\t\t\t\tpremisses this necessarily follows: that if we are to assume that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is not, but is possible, to be or to have come to be, nothing\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible must be involved. But in this case something impossible\n\t\t\t\t\twill take place; for the measuring of the diagonal is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible.The false is of course\n\t\t\t\t\tnot the same as the impossible; for although it is false that you are\n\t\t\t\t\tnow standing, it is not impossible.At the same time it is also clear that if B\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be real if A is, then if it is possible for A to be real, it must\n\t\t\t\t\talso be possible for B to be real; for even if B is not necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible, there is nothing to prevent its being possible. Let A, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tbe possible. Then when A was possible, if A was assumed to be real,\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing impossible was involved; but B was necessarily real\n\t\t\t\t\ttoo.But ex hypothesi\n\t\t\t\t\tB was impossible. Let B be impossible.Then if B is impossible, A must also be\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible. But A was by definition possible. Therefore so is\n\t\t\t\t\tB.If, therefore, A is possible, B\n\t\t\t\t\twill also be possible; that is if their relation was such that if A is\n\t\t\t\t\treal, B must be real.Then\n\t\t\t\t\tif, A and B being thus related, B is not possible on this condition, A\n\t\t\t\t\tand B will not be related as we assumed; and if when A is possible B\n\t\t\t\t\tis necessarily possible, then if A is real B must be real too. For to\n\t\t\t\t\tsay that B must be possible if A is possible means that if A is real\n\t\t\t\t\tat the time when and in the way in which it was assumed that it was\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible for it to be real, then B must be real at that time and in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat way.Since all potencies are either innate, like\n\t\t\t\t\tthe senses, or acquired by practice, like flute-playing, or by study,\n\t\t\t\t\tas in the arts, somesuch as are acquired by practice or a\n\t\t\t\t\trational formulawe can only possess when we have first\n\t\t\t\t\texercised them; in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tothers which are not of this kind and which imply passivity, this is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot necessary. Since anything\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is possible is something possible at some time and in some way,\n\t\t\t\t\tand with any other qualifications which are necessarily included in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe definition; and since some things can set up processes rationally\n\t\t\t\t\tand have rational potencies, while others are irrational and have\n\t\t\t\t\tirrational potencies; and since the former class can only belong to a\n\t\t\t\t\tliving thing, whereas the latter can belong both to living and to\n\t\t\t\t\tinanimate things: it follows that as for potencies of the latter kind,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the agent and the patient meet in accordance with the potency in\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion, the one must act and the other be acted upon; but in the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer kind of potency this is not necessary, for whereas each single\n\t\t\t\t\tpotency of the latter kind is productive of a single effect, those of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe former kind are productive of contrary effects, so that one potency will produce\n\t\t\t\t\tat the same time contrary effects.But this is impossible. Therefore there must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe some other deciding factor, by which I mean  or\n\t\t\t\t\t. For whichever of two things an\n\t\t\t\t\tanimal desires decisively it will do, when it is in circumstances\n\t\t\t\t\tappropriate to the potency and meets with that which admits of being\n\t\t\t\t\tacted upon. Therefore everything which is rationally capable, when it\n\t\t\t\t\tdesires something of which it has the capability, and in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcircumstances in which it has the capability, must do that\n\t\t\t\t\tthing.Now it has the\n\t\t\t\t\tcapability when that which admits of being acted upon is present and\n\t\t\t\t\tis in a certain state; otherwise it will not be able to act. (To add\n\t\t\t\t\tthe qualification \"if nothing external prevents it\" is no longer\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary; because the agent has the capability in so far as it is a\n\t\t\t\t\tcapability of acting; and this is not in all, but in certain\n\t\t\t\t\tcircumstances, in which external hindrances will be\n\t\t\t\t\texcluded;for they are\n\t\t\t\t\tprecluded by some of the positive qualifications in the\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition.)Hence\n\t\t\t\t\teven if it wishes or desires to do two things or contrary things\n\t\t\t\t\tsimultaneously, it will not do them, for it has not the capability to\n\t\t\t\t\tdo them under these conditions, nor has it the capability of doing\n\t\t\t\t\tthings simultaneously, since it will only do the things to which the\n\t\t\t\t\tcapability applies and under the appropriate conditions.Since we have now dealt with the kind of potency which is related to\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion, let us now discuss actuality; what it is, and what its\n\t\t\t\t\tqualities are. For as we continue our analysis it will also become\n\t\t\t\t\tclear with regard to the potential that we apply the name not only to\n\t\t\t\t\tthat whose nature it is to move or be moved by something else, either\n\t\t\t\t\twithout qualification or in some definite way, but also in other\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses; and it is on this account that in the course of our inquiry we\n\t\t\t\t\thave discussed these as well.\"Actuality\" means the presence\n\t\t\t\t\tof the thing, not in the sense which we mean by \"potentially.\" We say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat a thing is present potentially as Hermes is present in the wood,\n\t\t\t\t\tor the half-line in the whole, because it can be separated from it;\n\t\t\t\t\tand as we call even a man who is not studying \"a scholar\" if he is\n\t\t\t\t\tcapable of studying. That which is present in the opposite sense to\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is present actually.What we mean can be plainly seen in the particular cases by\n\t\t\t\t\tinduction; we need not seek a definition for every term, but must\n\t\t\t\t\tcomprehend the analogy: that as that which is actually building is to\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is capable of building, so is that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tawake to that which is asleep; and that which is seeing to that which\n\t\t\t\t\thas the eyes shut, but has the power of sight; and that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiated out of matter to the matter; and the finished article\n\t\t\t\t\tto the raw material.Let\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality be defined by one member of this antithesis, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tpotential by the other.But things are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot all said to exist actually in the same sense, but only by\n\t\t\t\t\tanalogyas A is in B or to B, so is C in or to D; for the\n\t\t\t\t\trelation is either that of motion to potentiality, or that of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance to some particular matter.Infinity and void\n\t\t\t\t\tand other concepts of this kind are said to \"be\" potentially or\n\t\t\t\t\tactually in a different sense from the majority of existing things,\n\t\t\t\t\te.g. that which sees, or walks, or is seen.For in these latter cases the predication may\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes be truly made without qualification, since \"that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tseen\" is so called sometimes because it is seen and sometimes because\n\t\t\t\t\tit is capable of being seen; but the Infinite does not exist\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially in the sense that it will ever exist separately in\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality; it is separable only in knowledge. For the fact that the\n\t\t\t\t\tprocess of division never ceases makes this actuality exist\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially, but not separately.Since no action which has a\n\t\t\t\t\tlimit is an end, but only a means to the end, as, e.g., the process of\n\t\t\t\t\tthinning;and since\n\t\t\t\t\tthe parts of the body themselves, when one is thinning them, are in\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion in the sense that they are not already that which it is the\n\t\t\t\t\tobject of the motion to make them, this process is not an action, or\n\t\t\t\t\tat least not a complete one, since it is not an end; it is the process\n\t\t\t\t\twhich includes the end that is an action.E.g., at the same time we see and have seen,\n\t\t\t\t\tunderstand and have understood, think and have thought; but we cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tat the same time learn and have learnt, or become healthy and be\n\t\t\t\t\thealthy. We are living well and have lived well, we are happy and have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen happy, at the same time; otherwise the process would have had to\n\t\t\t\t\tcease at some time, like the thinning-process; but it has not ceased\n\t\t\t\t\tat the present moment; we both are living and have lived.Now of these processes we should call the\n\t\t\t\t\tone type motions, and the other actualizations.Every motion is\n\t\t\t\t\tincompletethe processes of thinning, learning, walking,\n\t\t\t\t\tbuildingthese are motions, and incomplete at that. For it\n\t\t\t\t\tis not the same thing which at the same time is walking and has\n\t\t\t\t\twalked, or is building and has built, or is becoming and has become,\n\t\t\t\t\tor is being moved and has been moved, but two different things; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is causing motion is different from that which has caused\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion.But the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthing at the same time is seeing and has seen, is thinking and has\n\t\t\t\t\tthought. The latter kind of process, then, is what I mean by\n\t\t\t\t\tactualization, and the former what I mean by motion.What the actual is, then, and what it is like, may\n\t\t\t\t\tbe regarded as demonstrated from these and similar\n\t\t\t\t\tconsiderations.We must, however, distinguish when a\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular thing exists potentially, and when it does not; for it does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot so exist at any and every time. E.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tis earth potentially a man? No, but rather when it has already become\n\t\t\t\t\tsemen, and perhaps not even then; just as not\n\t\t\t\t\t can be healed by medicine, or even by\n\t\t\t\t\tchance, but there is some definite kind of thing which is capable of\n\t\t\t\t\tit, and this is that which is potentially healthy.The\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition of that which as a result of thought comes, from existing\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially, to exist actually, is that, when it has been willed, if\n\t\t\t\t\tno external influence hinders it, it comes to pass; and the condition\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of the patient, i.e. in the person who is being healed, is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat nothing in him should hinder the process. Similarly a house\n\t\t\t\t\texists potentially if there is nothing in X, the matter, to prevent it\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom becoming a house, i.e., if there is nothing which must be added\n\t\t\t\t\tor removed or changed; then X is potentially a house;and similarly in all other\n\t\t\t\t\tcases where the generative principle is external. And in all cases\n\t\t\t\t\twhere the generative principle is contained in the thing itself, one\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is potentially another when, if nothing external hinders, it\n\t\t\t\t\twill of itself become the other. E.g., the semen is not yet\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially a man; for it must further undergo a change in some other\n\t\t\t\t\tmedium. But when, by its own generative principle, it has\n\t\t\t\t\talready come to have the necessary attributes, in this state it is now\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially a man, whereas in the former state it has need of another\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple;just as\n\t\t\t\t\tearth is not yet potentially a statue, because it must undergo a\n\t\t\t\t\tchange before it becomes bronze.It\n\t\t\t\t\tseems that what we are describing is not a particular thing, but a\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinite material; e.g., a box is not wood, but wooden material,and wood is not earth, but earthen material; and\n\t\t\t\t\tearth also is an illustration of our point if it is similarly not some\n\t\t\t\t\tother thing, but a definite materialit is always the latter\n\t\t\t\t\tterm in this series which is, in the fullest sense, potentially\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else.E.g., a box\n\t\t\t\t\tis not earth, nor earthen, but wooden; for it is this that is\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially a box, and this is the matter of the boxthat\n\t\t\t\t\tis, wooden material in general is the matter of \"box\" in general,\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas the matter of a particular box is a particular piece of\n\t\t\t\t\twood.If there is some primary\n\t\t\t\t\tstuff, which is not further called the material of some other thing,\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is primary matter. E.g., if earth is \"made of air,\" and air is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot fire, but \"made of fire,\" then fire is primary matter, not being\n\t\t\t\t\tan individual thing.For\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subject or substrate is distinguishable into two kinds by either\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing or not being an individual thing. Take for example as the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject of the attributes \"man,\" or \"body\" or \"soul,\" and as an\n\t\t\t\t\tattribute \"cultured\" or \"white.\" Now the subject, when culture is\n\t\t\t\t\tinduced in it, is called not \"culture\" but \"cultured,\" and the man is\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled not whiteness but white; nor is he called \"ambulation\" or\n\t\t\t\t\t\"motion,\" but \"walking\" or \"moving\"; just as we said that things are\n\t\t\t\t\tof a definite material.Thus where \"subject\" has this sense, the ultimate substrate is\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance; but where it has not this sense, and the predicate is a\n\t\t\t\t\tform or individuality, the ultimate substrate is matter or material\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance. It is quite proper that both matter and attributes should\n\t\t\t\t\tbe described by a derivative predicate, since\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are both indefinite.Thus it has\n\t\t\t\t\tnow been stated when a thing should be said to exist potentially, and\n\t\t\t\t\twhen it should not.Now since we have distinguished the several senses of priority, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tobvious that actuality is prior to potentiality. By potentiality I\n\t\t\t\t\tmean not that which we have defined as \"a principle of change which is\n\t\t\t\t\tin something other than the thing changed, or in that same thing  other,\" but in general any principle of\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion or of rest; for nature also is in the same genus as\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality, because it is a principle of motion, although not in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome other thing, but in the thing itself \n\t\t\t\t\titself.To every potentiality of this kind\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality is prior, both in formula and in substance; in time it is\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes prior and sometimes not.That\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality is prior in formula is evident; for it is because it can be\n\t\t\t\t\tactualized that the potential, in the primary sense, is potential, I\n\t\t\t\t\tmean, e.g., that the potentially constructive is that which can\n\t\t\t\t\tconstruct, the potentially seeing that which can see, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially visible that which can be seen.The same principle holds in all other cases\n\t\t\t\t\ttoo, so that the formula and knowledge of the actual must precede the\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge of the potential.In time it\n\t\t\t\t\tis prior in this sense: the actual is prior to the potential with\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it is formally identical, but not to that with which it is\n\t\t\t\t\tidentical numerically.What\n\t\t\t\t\tI mean is this:that the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter and the seed and the thing which is capable of seeing, which\n\t\t\t\t\tare potentially a man and corn and seeing, but are not yet so\n\t\t\t\t\tactually, are prior in time to the individual man and corn and seeing\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject which already exist in actuality.But prior in time to these potential entities\n\t\t\t\t\tare other actual entities from which the former are generated; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tactually existent is always generated from the potentially existent by\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething which is actually existente.g., man by man,\n\t\t\t\t\tcultured by culturedthere is always some prime mover; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which initiates motion exists already in actuality.We have said\n\t\t\t\t\tin our discussion of substance that everything which is generated is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated from something and by something; and by something formally\n\t\t\t\t\tidentical with itself.Hence it seems impossible that a man can be a builder if he has\n\t\t\t\t\tnever built, or a harpist if he has never played a harp; because he\n\t\t\t\t\twho learns to play the harp learns by playing it, and similarly in all\n\t\t\t\t\tother cases.This was the\n\t\t\t\t\torigin of the sophists' quibble that a man who does not know a given\n\t\t\t\t\tscience will be doing that which is the object of that science,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the learner does not know the science. But since something of\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is being generated is already generated, and something of\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is being moved as a whole is already moved (this is\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstrated in our discussion on Motion), presumably the learner too must\n\t\t\t\t\tpossess something of the science.At any rate from this argument it is clear\n\t\t\t\t\tthat actuality is prior to potentiality in this sense too, i.e. in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect of generation and time.But it\n\t\t\t\t\tis also prior in substantiality; (a) because things which are\n\t\t\t\t\tposterior in generation are prior in form and substantiality; e.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tadult is prior to child, and man to semen, because the one already\n\t\t\t\t\tpossesses the form, but the other does not;and (b) because everything which is generated\n\t\t\t\t\tmoves towards a principle, i.e. its  . For the object\n\t\t\t\t\tof a thing is its principle; and generation has as its object the\n\t\t\t\t\t . And the actuality is the end, and it is for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of this that the potentiality is acquired; for animals do not\n\t\t\t\t\tsee in order that they may have sight, but have sight in order that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey may see.Similarly\n\t\t\t\t\tmen possess the art of building in order that they may build, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tpower of speculation that they may speculate; they do not speculate in\n\t\t\t\t\torder that they may have the power of speculationexcept\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who are learning by practice; and they do not really speculate,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut only in a limited sense, or about a subject about which they have\n\t\t\t\t\tno desire to speculate.Further, matter\n\t\t\t\t\texists potentially, because it may attain to the form; but when it\n\t\t\t\t\texists actually, it is then  the form. The same applies\n\t\t\t\t\tin all other cases, including those where the end is motion.Hence, just as teachers think\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they have achieved their end when they have exhibited their pupil\n\t\t\t\t\tperforming, so it is with nature. For if this is not so,it will be another case of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Pauson's Hermes\"; it will be impossible to\n\t\t\t\t\tsay whether the knowledge is  the pupil or outside him,\n\t\t\t\t\tas in the case of the Hermes. For the activity is the end, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality is the activity; hence the term \"actuality\" is derived from\n\t\t\t\t\t\"activity,\" and tends to have the meaning of \"complete\n\t\t\t\t\treality.\"Now whereas in some cases the ultimate\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is the use of the faculty, as, e.g., in the case of sight seeing\n\t\t\t\t\tis the ultimate thing, and sight produces nothing else besides this;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut in other cases something is produced, e.g. the art of building\n\t\t\t\t\tproduces not only the act of building but a house; nevertheless in the\n\t\t\t\t\tone case the use of the faculty is the end, and in the other it is\n\t\t\t\t\tmore truly the end than is the potentiality. For the act of building\n\t\t\t\t\tresides in the thing built; i.e., it comes to be and exists\n\t\t\t\t\tsimultaneously with the house.Thus in all cases\n\t\t\t\t\twhere the result is something other than the exercise of the faculty,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe actuality resides in the thing produced; e.g. the act of building\n\t\t\t\t\tin the thing built, the act of weaving in the thing woven, and so on;\n\t\t\t\t\tand in general the motion resides in the thing moved. But where there\n\t\t\t\t\tis no other result besides the actualization, the actualization\n\t\t\t\t\tresides in the subject; e.g. seeing in the seer, and speculation in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe speculator, and life in the soul (and hence also\n\t\t\t\t\thappiness, since happiness is a particular kind of life). Evidently,\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, substance or form is actuality. Thus it is obvious by this\n\t\t\t\t\targument that actuality is prior in substantiality to potentiality;\n\t\t\t\t\tand that in point of time, as we have said, one actuality presupposes\n\t\t\t\t\tanother right back to that of the prime mover in each case.It is also prior in a deeper sense; because that which is eternal is\n\t\t\t\t\tprior in substantiality to that which is perishable, and nothing\n\t\t\t\t\teternal is potential. The argument is as follows. Every potentiality\n\t\t\t\t\tis at the same time a potentiality for the opposite. For whereas that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is incapable of happening cannot happen to anything, everything\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is capable may fail to be actualized.Therefore that which is capable of being may\n\t\t\t\t\tboth be and not be. Therefore the same thing is capable both of being\n\t\t\t\t\tand of not being. But that which is capable of not being may possibly\n\t\t\t\t\tnot be; and that which may possibly not be is perishable; either\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely, or in the particular sense in which it is said that it may\n\t\t\t\t\tpossibly not be; that is, in respect either of place or of quantity or\n\t\t\t\t\tof quality. \"Absolutely\" means in respect of substance.Hence nothing which is\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely imperishable is absolutely potential (although there is no\n\t\t\t\t\treason why it should not be potential in some particular respect; e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tof quality or place); therefore all imperishable things are actual.\n\t\t\t\t\tNor can anything which is of necessity be potential; and yet these\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are primary, for if they did not exist, nothing would\n\t\t\t\t\texist.Nor can motion\n\t\t\t\t\tbe potential, if there is any eternal motion. Nor, if there is\n\t\t\t\t\tanything eternally in motion, is it potentially in motion (except in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect of some starting-point or destination), and there is no reason\n\t\t\t\t\twhy the matter of such a thing should not exist.Hence the sun and stars and the whole\n\t\t\t\t\tvisible heaven are always active, and there is no fear that they will\n\t\t\t\t\tever stopa fear which the writers on physics entertain. Nor do the\n\t\t\t\t\theavenly bodies tire in their activity; for motion does not imply for\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, as it does for perishable things, the potentiality for the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite, which makes the continuity of the motion distressing; this\n\t\t\t\t\tresults when the substance is matter and potentiality, not\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality.Imperishable things are resembled in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis respect by things which are always undergoing transformation,\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch as earth and fire; for the latter too are always active, since\n\t\t\t\t\tthey have their motion independently and in themselves. Other potentialities, according to the\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinctions already made, all admit of the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite result; for that which is capable of causing motion in a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain way can also cause it not in that way; that is if it acts\n\t\t\t\t\trationally.The same\n\t\t\t\t\tirrational potentialities can only produce opposite results by their\n\t\t\t\t\tpresence or absence.Thus if there are\n\t\t\t\t\tany entities or substances such as the dialecticians\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribe the Ideas to be, there must be something which has much more\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge than absolute knowledge, and much more mobility than motion;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor they will be in a truer sense\n\t\t\t\t\tactualities, whereas knowledge and motion will be their\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentialities. Thus it is obvious that actuality is prior\n\t\t\t\t\tboth to potentiality and to every principle of change.That a good actuality is both better and more estimable than a good\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality will be obvious from the following arguments. Everything\n\t\t\t\t\tof which we speak as capable is alike capable of contrary results;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g., that which we call capable of being well is alike capable of\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing ill, and has both potentialities at once; for the same\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality admits of health and disease, or of rest and motion, or\n\t\t\t\t\tof building and of pulling down, or of being built and of falling\n\t\t\t\t\tdown.Thus the\n\t\t\t\t\tcapacity for two contraries can belong to a thing at the same time,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut the contraries cannot belong at the same time; i.e., the\n\t\t\t\t\tactualities, e.g. health and disease, cannot belong to a thing at the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame time. Therefore one of them must be the good; but the\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality may equally well be both or neither. Therefore the\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality is better.Also in the case of evils the end or\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality must be worse than the potentiality; for that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tcapable is capable alike of both contraries.Clearly, then, evil does not exist apart from\n\t\t\t\t\t ; for evil is by nature posterior to\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality.Nor is there in things which are original and eternal any evil or\n\t\t\t\t\terror, or anything which has been destroyedfor destruction\n\t\t\t\t\tis an evil.Geometrical constructions, too, are discovered\n\t\t\t\t\tby an actualization, because it is by dividing that we discover them.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the division were already done, they would be obvious; but as it is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe division is only there potentially. Why is the sum of the interior\n\t\t\t\t\tangles of a triangle equal to two right angles? Because the angles\n\t\t\t\t\tabout one point <in a straight line> are equal to two\n\t\t\t\t\tright angles. If the line parallel to the side had been already drawn,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe answer would have been obvious at sight.Why is the angle in a semicircle always a right angle? If three\n\t\t\t\t\tlines are equal, the two forming the base, and the one set upright\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the middle of the base, the answer is obvious to one who knows\n\t\t\t\t\tthe former proposition. Thus it is evident that the\n\t\t\t\t\tpotential constructions are discovered by being actualized. The reason\n\t\t\t\t\tfor this is that the actualization is an act of thinking. Thus\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality comes from actuality (and therefore it is by constructive\n\t\t\t\t\taction that we acquire knowledge). <But this is true only in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe abstract>, for the individual actuality is posterior in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration to its potentiality.The terms \"being\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"not-being\" are used not only with reference to the types of\n\t\t\t\t\tpredication, and to the potentiality or actuality, or non-potentiality\n\t\t\t\t\tand non-actuality, of these types, but also (in the\n\t\t\t\t\tstrictest sense) to\n\t\t\t\t\tdenote truth and falsity. This depends, in the case of the objects,\n\t\t\t\t\tupon their being united or divided; so that he who thinks that what is\n\t\t\t\t\tdivided is divided, or that what is united is united, is right; while\n\t\t\t\t\the whose thought is contrary to the real condition of the objects is\n\t\t\t\t\tin error. Then  do what we call truth and falsity\n\t\t\t\t\texist or not exist? We must consider what we mean by these\n\t\t\t\t\tterms.It is not because we are right in thinking\n\t\t\t\t\tthat you are white that you are white; it is because you are white\n\t\t\t\t\tthat we are right in saying so. Now if whereas some things are always\n\t\t\t\t\tunited and cannot be divided, and others are always divided and cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tbe united, others again admit of both contrary states, then \"to be\" is\n\t\t\t\t\tto be united, i.e. a unity; and \"not to be\" is to be not united, but a\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality.Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tas regards the class of things which admit of both contrary states,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same opinion or the same statement comes to be false and true, and\n\t\t\t\t\tit is possible at one time to be right and at another wrong; but as\n\t\t\t\t\tregards things which cannot be otherwise the same opinion is not\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes true and sometimes false, but the same opinions are always\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue or always false.But with regard to incomposite\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, what is being or not-being, and truths or falsity? Such a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is not composite, so as to be when it is united and not to be\n\t\t\t\t\twhen it is divided,like the\n\t\t\t\t\tproposition that \"the wood is white,\" or \"the diagonal is\n\t\t\t\t\tincommensurable\"; nor will truth and falsity apply in the same way to\n\t\t\t\t\tthese cases as to the previous ones.In point of fact, just as truth is not the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame in these cases, so neither is being. Truth and falsity are as\n\t\t\t\t\tfollows: contact and assertion are truth (for\n\t\t\t\t\tassertion is not the same as affirmation), and ignorance is\n\t\t\t\t\tnon-contact. I say ignorance, because it is impossible to be deceived\n\t\t\t\t\twith respect to what a thing is, except accidentally;and the same applies to incomposite\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances, for it is impossible to be deceived about them. And they\n\t\t\t\t\tall exist actually, not potentially; otherwise they would be generated\n\t\t\t\t\tand destroyed; but as it is, Being itself is not generated (nor\n\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed); if it were, it would be generated out of something. With\n\t\t\t\t\trespect, then, to all things which are essences and actual, there is\n\t\t\t\t\tno question of being mistaken, but only of thinking or not thinking\n\t\t\t\t\tthem.Inquiry as to\n\t\t\t\t\t they are takes the form of inquiring whether\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are of such-and-such a nature or not.As for being in the sense of truth, and not-being\n\t\t\t\t\tin the sense of falsity, a unity is true if the terms are combined,\n\t\t\t\t\tand if they are not combined it is false. Again, if the unity exists,\n\t\t\t\t\tit exists in a particular way, and if it does not exist in that way,\n\t\t\t\t\tit does not exist at all. Truth means to think these objects, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is no falsity or deception, but only ignorancenot,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, ignorance such as blindness is; for blindness is like a total\n\t\t\t\t\tabsence of the power of thinking. And it is obvious that with regard\n\t\t\t\t\tto immovable things also, if one assumes that there are immovable\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, there is no deception in respect of time.E.g., if we suppose that the triangle\n\t\t\t\t\tis immutable, we shall not suppose that it sometimes contains two\n\t\t\t\t\tright angles and sometimes does not, for this would imply that it\n\t\t\t\t\tchanges; but we may suppose that one thing has a certain property and\n\t\t\t\t\tanother has not; e.g., that no even number is a prime, or that some\n\t\t\t\t\tare primes and others are not. But about a single number we cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\tmistaken even in this way, for we can no longer suppose that one\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance is of such a nature, and another not, but whether we are\n\t\t\t\t\tright or wrong, the fact is always the same."}}, {"@n": "10", "@type": "Book", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1052a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "15", "@ed": "Bekker", "@unit": "line"},

But although it has a number of senses,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe things which are primarily and essentially called one, and not in\n\t\t\t\t\tan accidental sense, may be summarized under four heads:(1.) That which is continuous,either absolutely or in\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular that which is continuous by natural growth and not by\n\t\t\t\t\tcontact or ligature; and of these things those are more strictly and\n\t\t\t\t\tin a prior sense one whose motion is more simple and\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible. (2.) Of this kind in a still higher\n\t\t\t\t\tdegree is that which is a whole and has a definite shape or form,\n\t\t\t\t\tparticularly that which is such by nature and not by constraint (like\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which are joined by glue or nails or by being tied together),\n\t\t\t\t\tbut which contains in itself the cause of its continuity.A thing is of this kind if its\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion is one and indivisible in respect of place and time; so that\n\t\t\t\t\tclearly if a thing has as its principle of motion the primary kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion (i.e. locomotion) in its primary form (i.e. circular\n\t\t\t\t\tlocomotion), it is in the primary sense  spatial\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnitude.Some things, then, are one in this sense,\n\t\t\t\t\t continuous or whole; the other things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are one are those whose formula is one.Such are the things of which the concept is\n\t\t\t\t\tone, i.e. of which the concept is indivisible; and this is indivisible\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the object is indivisible (3.) in form or (4.) in number. Now in\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber the individual is indivisible, and in form that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible in comprehension and knowledge; so that that which causes\n\t\t\t\t\tthe unity of substances must be one in the primary sense.Such, then, in number are the\n\t\t\t\t\tmeanings of \"one\": the naturally continuous, the whole, the\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual, and the universal. All these are one because they are\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible; some in motion, and others in concept or formula.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut we must recognize that the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions, \"What sort of things are called one?\" and \"What is\n\t\t\t\t\tessential unity, and what is the formula?\" must not be taken to be the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame. \"One\" has these\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral meanings, and each thing to which some one of these senses\n\t\t\t\t\tapplies will be one; but essential unity will have now one of these\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses and now something else, which is still nearer to the\n\t\t\t\t\t one, whereas they are nearer to its\n\t\t\t\t\t . This is also true of \"element\" and \"cause,\"\n\t\t\t\t\tsupposing that one had to explain them both by exhibiting concrete\n\t\t\t\t\texamples and by giving a definition of the term. There is a sense in which fire is an\n\t\t\t\t\telement (and no doubt so too is \"the indeterminate\" or some other similar thing, of its own\n\t\t\t\t\tnature), and there is a sense in which it is not; because \"to be fire\"\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"to be an element\" are not the same. It is as a concrete thing and\n\t\t\t\t\tas a stuff that fire is an element; but the term \"element\" denotes\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it has this attribute: that something is made of it as a primary\n\t\t\t\t\tconstituent. The same is\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue of \"cause\" or \"one\" and all other such terms.Hence \"to be one\" means \"to be indivisible\" (being\n\t\t\t\t\tessentially a particular thing, distinct and separate in place or form\n\t\t\t\t\tor thought), or \"to be whole and indivisible\"; but especially \"to be\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first measure of each kind,\" and above all of quantity; for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom this that it has been extended to the other categories. Measure is that by which quantity is known,\n\t\t\t\t\tand quantity  quantity is known either by\n\t\t\t\t\tunity or by number, and all number is known by unity. Therefore all\n\t\t\t\t\tquantity  quantity is known by unity, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat by which quantities are primarily known is absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tunity.Thus unity is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe starting point of number  number. Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tin other cases too \"measure\" means that by which each thing is\n\t\t\t\t\tprimarily known, and the measure of each thing is a unitin\n\t\t\t\t\tlength, breadth, depth, weight and speed.(The terms \"weight\" and \"speed\" are common to\n\t\t\t\t\tboth contraries, for each of them has a double meaning; e.g., \"weight\"\n\t\t\t\t\tapplies to that which has the least amount of gravity and also to that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich has excess of it, and speed to that which has the least amount\n\t\t\t\t\tof motion and also to that which has excess of it; for even the slow\n\t\t\t\t\thas some speed, and the light some weight.) In\n\t\t\t\t\tall these cases, then, the measure and starting-point is some\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible unit (since even in the case of lines we treat the\n\t\t\t\t\t\"one-foot line\" as indivisible). For everywhere we require as our\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasure an indivisible unit; i.e., that which is simple either in\n\t\t\t\t\tquality or in quantity.Now where it seems impossible to take away or add, there the measure\n\t\t\t\t\tis exact. Hence the measure of number is most\n\t\t\t\t\texact, for we posit the unit as in every way indivisible; and in all\n\t\t\t\t\tother cases we follow this example, for with the furlong or talent or\n\t\t\t\t\tin general with the greater measure an addition or subtraction would\n\t\t\t\t\tbe less obvious than with a smaller one.Therefore the first thing from which,\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to our perception, nothing can be subtracted is used by all\n\t\t\t\t\tmen as their measure of wet and dry, weight and magnitude; and they\n\t\t\t\t\tthink that they know the quantity only when they know it in terms of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis measure. And they know motion too by simple motion and the most\n\t\t\t\t\trapid, for this takes least time.Hence in astronomy a unit of this kind is the\n\t\t\t\t\tstarting point and measure; for they assume that the motion of the\n\t\t\t\t\theavens is uniform and the most rapid, and by it they judge the\n\t\t\t\t\tothers. In music the measure is the quarter tone, because it is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsmallest interval; and in language the letter. All these are examples\n\t\t\t\t\tof units in this sensenot in the sense that unity is\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething common to them all, but in the sense which we have\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribed.The\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasure is not always numerically one, but sometimes more than one;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g., there are two quarter tones, distinguished not by our hearing\n\t\t\t\t\tbut by their theoretical ratios; and the articulate sounds by which we measure\n\t\t\t\t\tspeech are more than one; and the diagonal of a square is measured by\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo quantities, and so are all magnitudes of this\n\t\t\t\t\tkind. Thus unity is the measure of all things, because we learn of\n\t\t\t\t\twhat the substance is composed by dividing it,in respect of either quantity or\n\t\t\t\t\tform.Hence unity is\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible, because that which is primary in each class of things is\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible. But not every unit is indivisible in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tsensee.g. the foot and the arithmetical unit; but the\n\t\t\t\t\tlatter is absolutely indivisible, and the former must be classed as\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible with respect to our power of perception, as we have\n\t\t\t\t\talready stated; since presumably everything which is continuous is\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisible. The measure is always akin to the\n\t\t\t\t\tthing measured. The measure of magnitude is magnitude, and in\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular the measure of length is a length; of breadth, a breadth;\n\t\t\t\t\tof sounds, a sound; of weight, a weight; of units, a unit; for this is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe view that we must take, and not that the measure of numbers is a\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber. The latter, indeed, would necessarily be true, if the analogy\n\t\t\t\t\theld good; but the supposition is not analogousit is as\n\t\t\t\t\tthough one were to suppose that the measure of units is units, and not\n\t\t\t\t\ta unit; for number is a plurality of units. We\n\t\t\t\t\talso speak of knowledge or sense perception as a measure of things for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same reason, because through them we come to know something;\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas really they are measured themselves rather than measure other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings. But our experience is as though someone else measured us, and\n\t\t\t\t\twe learned our height by noticing to what extent he applied his\n\t\t\t\t\tfoot-rule to us.Protagoras says that \"man is the measure of all things,\" meaning, as\n\t\t\t\t\tit were, the scholar or the man of perception; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthese because they possess, the one knowledge, and the other\n\t\t\t\t\tperception, which we hold to be the measures of objects. Thus, while\n\t\t\t\t\tappearing to say something exceptional, he is really saying\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing. Obviously, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tunity in the strictest sense, if we make our definition in accordance\n\t\t\t\t\twith the meaning of the term, is a measure; particularly of quantity,\n\t\t\t\t\tand secondarily of quality. Some things will be of this kind if they\n\t\t\t\t\tare indivisible in quantity, and others if in quality. Therefore that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is one is indivisible, either absolutely or  one. We must inquire, with regard to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance and nature of unity, in which sense it exists. This is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame question which we approached in our discussion of\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties: \n\t\t\t\t\tunity is, and what view we are to take of it; whether that unity\n\t\t\t\t\titself is a kind of substanceas first the Pythagoreans, and\n\t\t\t\t\tlater Plato, both maintainor whether rather some nature\n\t\t\t\t\tunderlies it, and we should give a more intelligible account of it,\n\t\t\t\t\tand more after the manner of the physicists; for of them one holds that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe One is Love, another Air, and another the Indeterminate.\n\t\t\t\t\tNow if no universal can be a substance (as we have stated in our\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussion\n\t\t\t\t\tof substance and being), and being itself cannot be a substance in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsense of one thing existing alongside the many (since it is common to\n\t\t\t\t\tthem), but only as a predicate,then clearly neither can unity be a substance;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause being and unity are the most universal of all\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicates.Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\t(a) genera are not certain entities and substances separate from other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings; and (b) unity cannot be a genus, for the same reasons that\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing and substance cannot.Further, the nature of unity must be the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame for all categories.Now being and unity have the same number of meanings; so that since\n\t\t\t\t\tin the category of qualities unity is something definite, i.e. some\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinite entity, and similarly in the category of quantity, clearly we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust also inquire in general what unity is, just as in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing; since it is not enough to say that its nature is simply unity\n\t\t\t\t\tor being.But in the sphere\n\t\t\t\t\tof colors unity is a color, e.g. white; that is if all the other\n\t\t\t\t\tcolors are apparently derived from white and black, and black is a\n\t\t\t\t\tprivation of white, as darkness is of light. Thus if all existing\n\t\t\t\t\tthings were colors, all existing things would be a number; but of\n\t\t\t\t\twhat?Clearly of\n\t\t\t\t\tcolors. And unity would be some one color, e.g. white. Similarly if\n\t\t\t\t\tall existing things were tunes, there would be a numberof\n\t\t\t\t\tquarter-tones; but their substance would not be a number; and unity\n\t\t\t\t\twould be something whose substance is not unity but a quarter-tone.\n\t\t\t\t\tSimilarly in the case of sounds,\n\t\t\t\t\texisting things would be a number of letters, and unity would be a\n\t\t\t\t\tvowel;and if\n\t\t\t\t\texisting things were right-lined figures, they would be a number of\n\t\t\t\t\tfigures, and unity would be a triangle. And the same principle holds\n\t\t\t\t\tfor all other genera. Therefore if in the categories of passivity and\n\t\t\t\t\tquality and quantity and motion there is in every category a number\n\t\t\t\t\tand a unity, and if the number is of particular things and the unity\n\t\t\t\t\tis a particular unity, and its substance is not unity, then the same\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be true in the case of substances, because the same is true in\n\t\t\t\t\tall cases. It is obvious, then, that in every genus one\n\t\t\t\t\tis a definite entity, and that in no case is its nature merely unity;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut as in the sphere of colors the One-itself which we have to seek is\n\t\t\t\t\tone color, so too in the sphere of substance the One-itself is one\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance.And that\n\t\t\t\t\tin a sense unity means the same as being is clear (a) from the fact\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it has a meaning corresponding to each of the categories, and is\n\t\t\t\t\tcontained in none of theme.g., it is contained neither in\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance nor in quality, but is related to them exactly as being is;\n\t\t\t\t\t(b) from the fact that in \"one man\" nothing more is predicated than in\n\t\t\t\t\t\"man\"(just as Being too\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not exist apart from some thing or quality or quantity); and (c)\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause \"to be one\" is \"to be a particular thing.\" \"One\" and \"Many\"\n\t\t\t\t\tare opposed in several ways. Unity and Plurality are opposed as being\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible and divisible; for that which is divided or divisible is\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled a plurality, and that which is indivisible or undivided is\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled one. Then since opposition is of four kinds, and one of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent pairs of opposites is used in a privative sense, they must be\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries, and neither contradictories nor relative terms.Unity is described and\n\t\t\t\t\texplained by its contrarythe indivisible by the\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisiblebecause plurality, i.e. the divisible, is more\n\t\t\t\t\teasily perceptible than the indivisible; and so in formula plurality\n\t\t\t\t\tis prior to the indivisible, on account of our powers of\n\t\t\t\t\tperception.To Unity belong (as we\n\t\t\t\t\tshowed by tabulation in our distinction of the contraries) Identity, Similarity and Equality;\n\t\t\t\t\tand to Plurality belong Otherness, Dissimilarity and\n\t\t\t\t\tInequality. \"Identity\" has several meanings.\n\t\t\t\t\t(a) Sometimes we speak of it in respect of number. (b) We call a thing\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same if it is one both in formula and in number, e.g., you are one\n\t\t\t\t\twith yourself both in form and in matter; and\n\t\t\t\t\tagain (c) if the formula of the primary substance is one, e.g., equal\n\t\t\t\t\tstraight lines are the same, and equal quadrilaterals with equal\n\t\t\t\t\tangles, and there are many more examples; but in these equality means\n\t\t\t\t\tunity. Things are \"similar\"(a) if, while not being the same absolutely\n\t\t\t\t\tor indistinguishable in respect of their concrete substance, they are\n\t\t\t\t\tidentical in form; e.g the larger square is similar to the smaller,\n\t\t\t\t\tand unequal straight lines are similar. These are similar, but not\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely the same. (b) If, having the same form, and being capable\n\t\t\t\t\tof difference in degree, they have no difference of degree.(c) If things have an attribute\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is the same and one in forme.g. whitein\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent degrees, we say that they are similar because their form is\n\t\t\t\t\tone. (d) If the respects in which they are the same are more than\n\t\t\t\t\tthose in which they differ, either in general or as regards their more\n\t\t\t\t\tprominent qualities; e.g., tin is similar to silver, as being white;\n\t\t\t\t\tand gold to fire, as being yellow or flame-colored. Thus\n\t\t\t\t\tit is obvious that \"Other\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Unlike\" also have several meanings. (a) In one sense \"other\" is used\n\t\t\t\t\tin the sense opposite to \"the same\"; thus everything in relation to\n\t\t\t\t\tevery other thing is either \"the same\" or \"other.\" (b) In another\n\t\t\t\t\tsense things are \"other\" unless both their matter and their formula\n\t\t\t\t\tare one; thus you are \"other\" than your neighbor. (c) The third sense\n\t\t\t\t\tis that which is found in mathematics. Therefore everything in relation to everything else is\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled either \"other\" or \"the same\"; that is, in the case of things of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich unity and being are predicated; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\"other\" is not the contradictory of \"the same,\" and so it is not\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicated of non-existent things (they are called \"not the same\"),\n\t\t\t\t\tbut it is predicated of all things which exist; for whatever is by\n\t\t\t\t\tnature existent and one is either one or not one with something\n\t\t\t\t\telse.\"Other\" and \"same,\" then,\n\t\t\t\t\tare opposed in this way; but \"difference\" is distinct from \"otherness.\"For that which is \"other\" than\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething need not be other in a particular respect, since everything\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is existent is either \"other\" or \"the same.\" But that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent from something is different in some particular respect, so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat that in which they differ must be the same sort of thing; i.e.\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same genus or species.For everything which is different differs either in genus or in\n\t\t\t\t\tspeciesin genus, such things as have not common matter and\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot be generated into or out of each other, e.g. things which\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to different categories; and in species, such things as are of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same genus (genus meaning that which is predicated of both the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent things alike in respect of their substance). The contraries\n\t\t\t\t\tare different, and contrariety is a kind of difference. That this is\n\t\t\t\t\trightly premissed is made clear by induction; for the contraries are\n\t\t\t\t\tobviously all different, since they are not merely \"other,\" but some\n\t\t\t\t\tare other in genus, and others are in the same line of predication,\n\t\t\t\t\tand so are in the same genus and the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame in genus. We have distinguished elsewhere what sort of things are the same or other\n\t\t\t\t\tin genus. Since things which differ can differ from one\n\t\t\t\t\tanother in a greater or less degree, there is a certain maximum\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference, and this I call contrariety. That it is the maximum\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference is shown by induction. For whereas things which differ in\n\t\t\t\t\tgenus have no means of passing into each other, and are more widely\n\t\t\t\t\tdistant, and are not comparable, in the case of things which differ in\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies the contraries are the extremes from which generation takes\n\t\t\t\t\tplace;and the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreatest distance is that which is between the extremes, and therefore\n\t\t\t\t\talso between the contraries. But in every class the greatest thing is\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete. For (a) that is greatest which cannot be exceeded, and (b)\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is complete outside which nothing proper to it can be found. For\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete difference implies an end, just as all other things are\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled complete because they imply an end.And there is nothing beyond the end; for in\n\t\t\t\t\teverything the end is the last thing, and forms the boundary. Thus\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is nothing beyond the end, and that which is complete lacks\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing.From this argument, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tit is clear that contrariety is maximum difference; and since we speak\n\t\t\t\t\tof contraries in various senses, the sense of completeness will vary\n\t\t\t\t\tin accordance with the sense of contrariety which applies to the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries. This being so, evidently one thing cannot\n\t\t\t\t\thave more than one contrary (since there can be nothing more extreme\n\t\t\t\t\tthan the extreme, nor can there be more than two extremes of one\n\t\t\t\t\tinterval); and in general this is evident, if contrariety is\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference, and difference (and therefore complete difference) is\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween two things. The other definitions of contraries\n\t\t\t\t\tmust also be true, for (1.) complete difference is the maximum\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference; since (a) we can find nothing beyond it, whether things\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffer in genus or in species (for we have shown that difference in\n\t\t\t\t\trelation to things outside the genus is impossible; this is the\n\t\t\t\t\tmaximum difference between them); and (b) the things which differ most\n\t\t\t\t\tin the same genus are contraries; for complete difference is the\n\t\t\t\t\tmaximum difference between these.(2.) The things which differ most in the same\n\t\t\t\t\treceptive material are contraries; for contraries have the same\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter. (3.) The most different things which come under the same\n\t\t\t\t\tfaculty are contraries; for one science treats of one class of things,\n\t\t\t\t\tin which complete difference is the greatest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Positive state\" and \"Privation\" constitute primary\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrarietynot every form of privation (for it has several\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses), but any form which is complete. All other contraries must be\n\t\t\t\t\tso called with respect to these; some because they possess these,\n\t\t\t\t\tothers because they produce them or are productive of them, and others\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they are acquisitions or losses of these or other\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries.Now if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe types of opposition are contradiction, privation, contrariety and\n\t\t\t\t\trelation, and of these the primary type is\n\t\t\t\t\tcontradiction, and an intermediate is impossible in contradiction but\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible between contraries, obviously contradiction is not the same\n\t\t\t\t\tas contrariety; and privation is a form of contradiction;for it is either that which is\n\t\t\t\t\ttotally incapable of possessing some attribute, or that which would naturally possess some\n\t\t\t\t\tattribute but does not, that suffers privationeither\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely or in some specified way. Here we already have several\n\t\t\t\t\tmeanings, which we have distinguished elsewhere. Thus privation is a\n\t\t\t\t\tkind of contradiction or incapacity which is determinate or associated\n\t\t\t\t\twith the receptive material.This is why though there is no intermediate in\n\t\t\t\t\tcontradiction there is one in some kinds of privation. For everything\n\t\t\t\t\tis either equal or not equal, but not everything is either equal or\n\t\t\t\t\tunequal; if it is, it is only so in the case of a material which\n\t\t\t\t\tadmits of equality. If, then, processes of material generation start\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the contraries, and proceed either from the form and the\n\t\t\t\t\tpossession of the form, or from some privation of the form or shape,\n\t\t\t\t\tclearly all contrariety must be a form of privation, although\n\t\t\t\t\tpresumably not all privation is contrariety.This is because that which suffers privation\n\t\t\t\t\tmay suffer it in several senses; for it is only the extremes from\n\t\t\t\t\twhich changes proceed that are contraries.This can also be shown by induction. Every\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrariety involves privation as one of its contraries, but not\n\t\t\t\t\talways in the same way:inequality involves the privation of equality, dissimilarity that of\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarity, evil that of goodness.And the differences are as we have stated: one\n\t\t\t\t\tcase is, if a thing is merely deprived; another, if it is deprived at\n\t\t\t\t\ta certain time or in a certain parte.g. at a certain age or\n\t\t\t\t\tin the important partor entirely. Hence in some cases there\n\t\t\t\t\tis an intermediate (there are men who are neither good nor bad), and\n\t\t\t\t\tin others there is nota thing must be either odd or\n\t\t\t\t\teven.Again, some\n\t\t\t\t\thave a determinate subject, and others have not. Thus it is evident\n\t\t\t\t\tthat one of a pair of contraries always has a privative sense; but it\n\t\t\t\t\tis enough if this is true of the primary or generic contraries, e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tunity and plurality; for the others can be reduced to them.\n\t\t\t\t\tSince one thing has one contrary, it might be asked in what sense\n\t\t\t\t\tunity is opposed to plurality, and the equal to the great and to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall. For if we always use the word \"whether\" in an\n\t\t\t\t\tantithesise.g., \"whether it is white or black,\" or \"whether\n\t\t\t\t\tit is white or not\" (but we do not ask \"whether it is a man or white,\"\n\t\t\t\t\tunless we are proceeding upon some assumption, and asking, for\n\t\t\t\t\tinstance, whether it was Cleon who came or\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates.This is not a necessary disjunction in any\n\t\t\t\t\tclass of things, but is derived from the use in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\toppositesfor it is only opposites that cannot be true at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same timeand we have this same use here in the question\n\t\t\t\t\t\"which of the two came?\" for if both\n\t\t\t\t\talternatives were possible, the question would be absurd; but even so\n\t\t\t\t\tthe question falls into an antithesis: that of \"one\" or\n\t\t\t\t\t\"many\"i.e., \"whether both came, or\n\t\t\t\t\tone\") if,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, the question \"whether\" is always concerned with opposites, and\n\t\t\t\t\twe can ask \"whether it is greater or smaller, or equal,\" what is the\n\t\t\t\t\tnature of the antithesis between \"equal\" and \"greater or smaller\"? It\n\t\t\t\t\tis contrary neither to one only, nor to both: for (a) it is no more\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to the greater than to the smaller; (b) \"equal\" is contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tto \"unequal,\" and thus it will be contrary to more than one\n\t\t\t\t\tthing;(c) if\n\t\t\t\t\t\"unequal\" means the same as both \"greater\" and \"smaller\" at the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime, \"equal\" must still be opposed to them both: This difficulty\n\t\t\t\t\tsupports the theory that \"the unequal\" is a duality. But the result is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat one thing is contrary to two; which is impossible.\n\t\t\t\t\tFurther, it is apparent that \"equal\" is intermediate between \"great\"\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"small,\" but it is not apparent that any contrariety is\n\t\t\t\t\tintermediate, nor can it be, by definition; for it could not be\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete if it were the intermediate of something, but rather it\n\t\t\t\t\talways has something intermediate between itself and the other\n\t\t\t\t\textreme.It remains, then, that it\n\t\t\t\t\tis opposed either as negation or as privation. Now it cannot be so\n\t\t\t\t\topposed to one of the two, for it is no more opposed to the great than\n\t\t\t\t\tto the small.Therefore it\n\t\t\t\t\tis a privative negation of both. For this reason we say \"whether\" with\n\t\t\t\t\treference to both, and not to one of the twoe.g., \"whether\n\t\t\t\t\tit is greater or equal,\" or \"whether it is equal or\n\t\t\t\t\tsmaller\";there are\n\t\t\t\t\talways three alternatives. But it is not a necessary privation; for\n\t\t\t\t\tnot everything is equal which is not greater or smaller, but only\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which would naturally have these attributes. The\n\t\t\t\t\tequal, then, is that which is neither great nor small, but would\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally be either great or small; and it is opposed to both as a\n\t\t\t\t\tprivative negation, and therefore is intermediate between them. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is neither good nor bad is opposed to both, but it has no\n\t\t\t\t\tname (for each of these terms has several meanings, and there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tone material which is receptive of both); that which is neither white\n\t\t\t\t\tnor black is better entitled to a name,although even this has no single name, but the\n\t\t\t\t\tcolors of which this negation is privatively predicated are to a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain extent limited; for it must be either grey or buff or\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething similar. Therefore those persons are wrong in\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir criticism who imagine that all terms are used analogously, so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat that which is neither a shoe nor a hand will be intermediate\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween \"shoe\" and \"hand,\" because that which is neither good nor bad\n\t\t\t\t\tis intermediate between good and badas though there must be\n\t\t\t\t\tan intermediate in all cases; but this does not necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\tfollow.For the one\n\t\t\t\t\tis a joint negation of opposites where there is an intermediate and a\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural interval; but in the other case there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion of difference, since the joint negation applies to things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are in different genera, and therefore the substrate is not\n\t\t\t\t\tone. A\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar question might be raised about \"one\" and \"many.\" For if \"many\"\n\t\t\t\t\tis absolutely opposed to \"one,\" certain impossibilities result. (1)\n\t\t\t\t\tOne will be few; for \"many\" is also opposed to \"few.\"(2) Two will be many; since\n\t\t\t\t\t\"twofold\" is \"manifold,\" and \"twofold\" is derived from two. Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tone will be few; for in what relation can two be many if not in\n\t\t\t\t\trelation to one, which must therefore be few? for there can be nothing\n\t\t\t\t\tless. (3) If \"much\" and \"little\" are in plurality what \"long\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"short\" are in length, and if whatever is \"much\" is also\n\t\t\t\t\t\"many,\"and \"many\" is\n\t\t\t\t\t\"much\" (unless indeed there is a difference in the case of a plastic\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinuum), \"few\" will be a\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality. Therefore one will be a plurality, if it is few; and this\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily follows if two is many. Presumably, however, although\n\t\t\t\t\t\"many\" in a sense means \"much,\" there is a distinction; e.g., water is\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled \"much\" but not \"many.\"To all things, however, which are divisible\n\t\t\t\t\tthe term \"many\" is applicable: in one sense, if there is a plurality\n\t\t\t\t\twhich involves excess either absolutely or relatively (and similarly\n\t\t\t\t\t\"few\" is a plurality involving defect); and in another in the sense of\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber, in which case it is opposed to \"one\" only.For we say \"one or many\" just as if we\n\t\t\t\t\twere to say \"one and ones,\" or \"white thing and white things,\" or were\n\t\t\t\t\tto compare the things measured with the measure.Multiples, too, are spoken of in this\n\t\t\t\t\tway; for every number is \"many,\" because it consists of \"ones,\" and\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause every number is measurable by one; and also as being the\n\t\t\t\t\topposite of one, and not of few. In this sense even two is many; but\n\t\t\t\t\tas a plurality involving excess either relatively or absolutely it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot many, but the first plurality. Two is, however, absolutely few;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause it is the first plurality involving defect(hence Anaxagoras was not right in leaving the subject\n\t\t\t\t\tby saying \"all things were together, infinite both in multitude and in\n\t\t\t\t\tsmallness\"; instead of \"in smallness\" he should have said \"in\n\t\t\t\t\tfewness,\" for things cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tbe infinite in fewness), since fewness is constituted not by one, as\n\t\t\t\t\tsome hold, but by two. In the sphere of numbers \"one\"\n\t\t\t\t\tis opposed to many as the measure to the measurable, i.e., as relative\n\t\t\t\t\tterms are opposed which are not of their own nature relative. We have\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinguished elsewhere that things\n\t\t\t\t\tare called relative in two senseseither as being\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries, or as knowledge is related to the knowable, A being\n\t\t\t\t\trelated to B because B is described in relation to A.  There is no reason why one should not\n\t\t\t\t\tbe fewer than something, e.g. two; for if it is fewer it is not\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore few. Plurality is, as it were, a genus of number, since\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber is a plurality measurable by one. And in a sense one and number\n\t\t\t\t\tare opposed; not, however, as being contrary, but as we have said some\n\t\t\t\t\trelative terms to be; for it is  measure and\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasurable that they are opposed.(Hence not everything which is one is a\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbere.g., a thing which is indivisible.) But although the\n\t\t\t\t\trelation between knowledge and the knowable is said to be similar to\n\t\t\t\t\tthis, it turns out not to be similar. For it would seem that knowledge\n\t\t\t\t\tis a measure, and the knowable that which is measurable by it; but it\n\t\t\t\t\thappens that whereas all knowledge is knowable, the knowable is not\n\t\t\t\t\talways knowledge, because in a way knowledge is measured by the\n\t\t\t\t\tknowable.\n\t\t\t\t\tPlurality is contrary neither to the few (whose real contrary is the\n\t\t\t\t\tmany, as an excessive plurality to an exceeded plurality) nor in\n\t\t\t\t\t senses to one; but they are contrary in one\n\t\t\t\t\tsense (as has been said) as being the one divisible and the other\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible; and in another as being relative (just as knowledge is\n\t\t\t\t\trelative to the knowable) if plurality is a number and one is the\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasure. Since there can be, and in some cases is, an\n\t\t\t\t\tintermediate between contraries, intermediates must be composed of\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries;for all\n\t\t\t\t\tintermediates are in the same genus as the things between which they\n\t\t\t\t\tare intermediate.By\n\t\t\t\t\tintermediates we mean those things into which that which changes must\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst change. E.g., if we change from the highest string to the lowest\n\t\t\t\t\tby the smallest gradations we shall first come to the intermediate\n\t\t\t\t\tnotes; and in the case of colors if we change from white to black we\n\t\t\t\t\tshall come to red and grey before we come to black; and similarly in\n\t\t\t\t\tother cases.But change\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom one genus into another is impossible except accidentally; e.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom color to shape. Therefore intermediates must be in the same genus\n\t\t\t\t\tas one another and as the things between which they are\n\t\t\t\t\tintermediate.But all\n\t\t\t\t\tintermediates are between certain opposites, for it is only from these\n\t\t\t\t\tper se that change is possible.Hence there can be no intermediate between\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which are not opposites; for then there would be change also\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween things which are not opposites. Of things which are opposites,\n\t\t\t\t\tcontradiction has no intermediate term (for contradiction means this:\n\t\t\t\t\tan antithesis one term of which must apply to any given thing, and\n\t\t\t\t\twhich contains no intermediate term); of the remaining types of\n\t\t\t\t\topposites some are relative, others privative, and others\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary.Those\n\t\t\t\t\trelative opposites which are not contrary have no intermediate. The\n\t\t\t\t\treason for this is that they are not in the same genus\n\t\t\t\t\tfor what is intermediate between\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge and the knowable?but between great and small\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is an intermediate. Now since intermediates are in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tgenus, as has been shown, and are between contraries, they must be\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of those contraries. For the contraries must either belong to\n\t\t\t\t\ta genus or not. And if there is a genus in such a waythat it is something prior to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe contraries, then the differentiae which constitute the contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies (for species consist of genus and differentiae) will be\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries in a prior sense.E.g., if white and black are contraries, and the one is a\n\t\t\t\t\tpenetrative and the other a compressive color, these\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiae, \"penetrative\" and \"compressive,\" are prior, and so are\n\t\t\t\t\topposed to each other in a prior sense.But it is the species which have contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiae that are more truly contraries; the other, i.e.\n\t\t\t\t\tintermediate, species will consist of genus and differentiae. E.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tall colors which are intermediate between white and black should be\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribed by their genus (i.e. color) and by certain\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiae.But\n\t\t\t\t\tthese differentiae will not be the primary contraries; otherwise every\n\t\t\t\t\tthing will be either white or black. Therefore they will be different\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the primary contraries. Therefore they will be intermediate\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween them, and the primary differentiae will be \"the penetrative\"\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"the compressive.\"Thus\n\t\t\t\t\twe must first investigate the contraries which are not contained in a\n\t\t\t\t\tgenus, and discover of what their intermediates are\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed.For things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are in the same genus must either be composed of differentiae\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are not compounded with the genus, or be incomposite. Contraries\n\t\t\t\t\tare not compounded with one another, and are therefore first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples; but intermediates are either all incomposite or none of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem. Now from the contraries something is generated in such a way\n\t\t\t\t\tthat change will reach it before reaching the contraries themselves\n\t\t\t\t\t(for there must be something which is less in degree than one contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tand greater than the other). Therefore this also will be intermediate\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween the contraries.Hence all the other intermediates must be composite; for that which\n\t\t\t\t\tis greater in degree than one contrary and less than the other is in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome sense a compound of the contraries of which it is said to be\n\t\t\t\t\tgreater in degree than one and less than the other. And since there is\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing else homogeneous which is prior to the contraries, all\n\t\t\t\t\tintermediates must be composed of contraries.Therefore all the lower terms, both\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries and intermediates, must be composed of the primary\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries. Thus it is clear that intermediates are all in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tgenus, and are between contraries, and are all composed of\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries. That which is \"other in species\" than\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else is \"other\" in respect of something and that something\n\t\t\t\t\tmust apply to both. E.g., if an animal is other in species than\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else, they must both be animals. Hence things which are\n\t\t\t\t\tother in species must be in the same genus. The sort of thing I mean\n\t\t\t\t\tby \"genus\" is that in virtue of which two things are both called the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame one thing; and which is not accidentally\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiated, whether regarded as matter or otherwise.For not only must the common\n\t\t\t\t\tquality belong to both, e.g., that they are both animals, but the very\n\t\t\t\t\tanimality of each must be different; e.g., in one case it must be\n\t\t\t\t\tequinity and in the other humanity. Hence the common quality must for\n\t\t\t\t\tone be other in species than that which it is for the other. They must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe, then, of their very nature, the one  kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tanimal, and the other  ; e.g., the one a horse and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other a man.Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tthis difference must be \"otherness of genus\" (I say \"otherness of\n\t\t\t\t\tgenus\" because by \"difference of genus\" I mean an otherness which\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes the genus itself other); this, then, will be a form of\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrariety. This is obvious by induction. For all\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiation is by opposites, and we have shown that\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries are in the same genus, because contrariety was shown to be\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete difference. But difference in species is always difference\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom something in respect of something; therefore this is the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthing, i.e. the genus, for both.(Hence too all contraries which differ in\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies but not in genus are in the same line of predication, and are\n\t\t\t\t\tother than each other in the highest degree; for their difference is\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete, and they cannot come into existence simultaneously.) Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tthe difference is a form of contrariety.To be \"other in species,\" then, means this: to be in the same genus\n\t\t\t\t\tand involve contrariety, while being indivisible(and \"the same in species\" applies to\n\t\t\t\t\tall things which do not involve contrariety, while being\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible);for it\n\t\t\t\t\tis in the course of differentiation and in the intermediate terms that\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrariety appears, before we come to the indivisibles.\n\t\t\t\t\tThus it is evident that in relation to what is called genus no species\n\t\t\t\t\tis either the same or other in species (and this is as it should be,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the matter is disclosed by negation, and the genus is the matter\n\t\t\t\t\tof that of which it is predicated as genus; not in the sense in which\n\t\t\t\t\twe speak of the genus or clan of the Heraclidae, but as we speak of a genus in\n\t\t\t\t\tnature); nor yet in relation to things which are not in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tgenus. From the latter it will differ in genus, but in species from\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which are in the same genus. For the difference of things which\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffer in species must be a contrariety; and this belongs only to\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which are in the same genus. The question\n\t\t\t\t\tmight be raised as to why woman does not differ in species from man,\n\t\t\t\t\tseeing that female is contrary to male, and difference is contrariety;\n\t\t\t\t\tand why a female and a male animal are not other in species, although\n\t\t\t\t\tthis difference belongs to \"animal\" per se, and not as whiteness or\n\t\t\t\t\tblackness does; \"male\" and \"female\" belong to it  animal.This\n\t\t\t\t\tproblem is practically the same as \"why does one kind of contrariety\n\t\t\t\t\t(e.g. \"footed\" and \"winged\") make things other in species, while\n\t\t\t\t\tanother (e.g. whiteness and blackness) does not?\" The answer may be\n\t\t\t\t\tthat in the one case the attributes are peculiar to the genus, and in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other they are less so; and since one\n\t\t\t\t\telement is formula and the other matter, contrarieties in the formula\n\t\t\t\t\tproduce difference in species, but contrarieties in the concrete whole\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not.Hence the whiteness\n\t\t\t\t\tor blackness of a man does not produce this, nor is there any specific\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference between a white man and a black man; not even if one term\n\t\t\t\t\tis assigned to each. For we are now regarding \"man\" as matter, and\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter does not produce difference; and for this reason, too,\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual men are not species of \"man,\" although the flesh and bones\n\t\t\t\t\tof which this and that man consist are different. The concrete whole\n\t\t\t\t\tis \"other,\" but not \"other in species,\" because there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrariety in the formula, and this is the ultimate indivisible\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies.But Callias\n\t\t\t\t\tis definition  matter. Then so too is \"white man,\"\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause it is the individual, Callias, who is white. Hence \"man\" is\n\t\t\t\t\tonly white accidentally. Again, a bronze circle and a wooden one do\n\t\t\t\t\tnot differ in species; and a bronze triangle and a wooden circle\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffer in species not because of their matter, but because there is\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrariety in their formulae. But does not\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter, when it is \"other\" in a particular way, make things \"other in\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies\"? Probably there is a sense in which it does. Otherwise why is\n\t\t\t\t\tthis particular horse \"other in species\" than this particular man,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough the definitions involve matter? Surely it is because there is\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrariety in the definition, for so there also is in \"white man\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"black horse\";and it is a\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrariety in species, but not because one is white and the other\n\t\t\t\t\tblack; for even if they had both been white, they would still be\n\t\t\t\t\t\"other in species.\" \"Male\" and \"female\" are attributes\n\t\t\t\t\tpeculiar to the animal, but not in virtue of its substance; they ar\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterial or physical. Hence the same semen may, as the result of some\n\t\t\t\t\tmodification, become either female or male.We have now stated what \"to be other in species\"\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans, and why some things differ in species and others do\n\t\t\t\t\tnot. Since contraries are other in form, and \"the perishable\" and \"imperishable\" are contraries (for privation is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinite incapacity), \"the perishable\" must be \"other in kind\" than\n\t\t\t\t\t\"the imperishable.\" But so far we have spoken only of the universal\n\t\t\t\t\tterms; and so it might appear to be unnecessary that\n\t\t\t\t\t perishable and imperishable should be \"other in\n\t\t\t\t\tform,\" just as in the case of white and black.For the same thing may be both at the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame time, if it is a universal (e.g, \"man\" may be both white and\n\t\t\t\t\tblack); and it may still be both if it is a particular, for the same\n\t\t\t\t\tperson may be white and black, although not at the same time. Yet\n\t\t\t\t\twhite is contrary to black. But although some contraries(e.g. those which we have just\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned, and many others) can belong to certain things accidentally,\n\t\t\t\t\tothers cannot; and this applies to \"the perishable\"\n\t\t\t\t\tand \"the imperishable.\" Nothing is accidentally perishable; for that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is accidental may not be applicable; but perishability is an\n\t\t\t\t\tattribute which applies necessarily when it is applicable at all.\n\t\t\t\t\tOtherwise one and the same thing will be imperishable as well as\n\t\t\t\t\tperishable, if it is possible for perishability not to apply to\n\t\t\t\t\tit.Thus\n\t\t\t\t\tperishability must be either the substance or in the substance of\n\t\t\t\t\tevery perishable thing. The same argument also applies to the\n\t\t\t\t\timperishable; for both perishability and imperishability are\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes which are necessarily applicable. Hence the characteristics\n\t\t\t\t\tin respect of which and in direct consequence of which one thing is\n\t\t\t\t\tperishable and another imperishable are opposed; and therefore they\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be other in kind.Thus it is obvious that there cannot be Forms such as some thinkers\n\t\t\t\t\tmaintain; for then there would be both a perishable and an\n\t\t\t\t\timperishable \"man.\" Yet the Forms are said to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe the same in species as the particulars, and not merely to share a\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon predicate with them; but things which are other in genus differ\n\t\t\t\t\tmore widely than things which are other in species."}}, {"@n": "11", "@type": "Book", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1059a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "18", "@ed": "Bekker", "@unit": "line"}, {"@ed": "P",

If as one, it may be objected that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe objects of one science are always contraries; but the first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples are not contraries. And if it is not one, what sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tsciences are we to suppose them to be? Again, is it the\n\t\t\t\t\tprovince of one science, or of more than one, to study the principles\n\t\t\t\t\tof demonstration? If of one, why of it rather than of any\n\t\t\t\t\tother? And if of more than one, of what sort are we to suppose them to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe?Again, are we to suppose that\n\t\t\t\t\tWisdom deals with all substances or not? If not with\n\t\t\t\t\tall, it is hard to lay down with what kind it does deal; while if\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is one science of them all, it is not clear how the same science\n\t\t\t\t\tcan deal with more than one subject. Again, is this\n\t\t\t\t\tscience concerned only with substances, or with attributes as\n\t\t\t\t\twell? For if it is a demonstration of\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes, it is not concerned with substances; and if there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tseparate science of each, what is each of these sciences, and which of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem is Wisdom?  demonstrative, the science\n\t\t\t\t\tof attributes appears to be Wisdom; but \n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned with that which is primary, the science of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances. Nor must we suppose that the science\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we are seeking is concerned with the causes described in the\n\t\t\t\t\t. It is not\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned with the final cause; for this is the Good, and this belongs\n\t\t\t\t\tto the sphere of action and to things which are in motion; and it is\n\t\t\t\t\tthis which first causes motion (for the  is of this\n\t\t\t\t\tnature); but there is no Prime Mover in the sphere of immovable\n\t\t\t\t\tthings.And in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral it is a difficult question whether the science which we are\n\t\t\t\t\tnow seeking is concerned with sensible substances, or not with sensible substances, but with some\n\t\t\t\t\tother kind. If with another kind, it must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe concerned either with the Forms or with mathematical objects. Now\n\t\t\t\t\tclearly the Forms do not exist. (But nevertheless, even if we posit\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, it is a difficult question as to why the same rule does not\n\t\t\t\t\tapply to the other things of which there are Forms as applies to the\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects of mathematics.I\n\t\t\t\t\tmean that they posit the objects of mathematics as intermediate\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween the Forms and sensible things, as a third class besides the\n\t\t\t\t\tForms and the things of our world; but there is no \"third man\"\n\t\t\t\t\tor \"horse\" besides the Ideal one and the particulars. If on the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand it is not as they make out, what sort of objects are we to\n\t\t\t\t\tsuppose to be the concern of the mathematician? Not surely the things\n\t\t\t\t\tof our world; for none of these is of the kind which the mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tsciences investigate.)Nor\n\t\t\t\t\tindeed is the science which we are now seeking concerned with the\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects of mathematics; for none of them can exist separately. But it\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not deal with sensible substances either; for they are\n\t\t\t\t\tperishable.In general the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion might be raised, to what science it pertains to discuss the\n\t\t\t\t\tproblems concerned with the matter of mathematical objects.It is not the province of physics,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the whole business of the physicist is with things which\n\t\t\t\t\tcontain in themselves a principle of motion and rest; nor yet of the\n\t\t\t\t\tscience which inquires into demonstration andscientific knowledge,for it is simply this sort of thing which forms the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject of its inquiry. It remains, therefore, that it is the science\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we have set ourselves to find that treats of these\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects. One might consider the question\n\t\t\t\t\twhether we should regard the science which we are now seeking as\n\t\t\t\t\tdealing with the principles which by some are called elements. But everyone assumes that these are\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent in composite things; and it would seem rather that the science\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we are seeking must be concerned with universals, since every\n\t\t\t\t\tformula and every science is of universals and not of ultimate\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies; so that in this case it must deal with the primary\n\t\t\t\t\tgenera.These would\n\t\t\t\t\tbe Being and Unity; for these, if any, might best be supposed to\n\t\t\t\t\tembrace all existing things, and to be most of the nature of first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples, because they are by nature primary; for if they are\n\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed, everything else is destroyed with them, since everything\n\t\t\t\t\texists and is one.But\n\t\t\t\t\tinasmuch as, if Being and Unity are to be regarded as genera, they\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be predicable of their differentiae, whereas no genus is\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicable of any of its differentiae, from this point of view it\n\t\t\t\t\twould seem that they should be regarded neither as genera nor as\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples.Further,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince the more simple is more nearly a principle than the less simple,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the ultimate subdivisions of the genus are more simple than the\n\t\t\t\t\tgenera (because they are indivisible), and the genera are divided into\n\t\t\t\t\ta number of different species, it would seem that species are more\n\t\t\t\t\tnearly a principle than genera.On the other hand, inasmuch as species are\n\t\t\t\t\tdestroyed together with their genera, it seems more likely that the\n\t\t\t\t\tgenera are principles; because that which involves the\n\t\t\t\t\tdestruction of something else is a principle. These and other similar\n\t\t\t\t\tpoints are those which cause us perplexity. Again,\n\t\t\t\t\tought we to assume the existence of something else besides particular\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, or are they the objects of the science which we are\n\t\t\t\t\tseeking? It is true that they are\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite in number; but then the things which exist besides\n\t\t\t\t\tparticulars are genera or species, and neither of these is the object\n\t\t\t\t\tof the science which we are now seeking. We have explained why this is impossible.Indeed, in general it is a difficult question\n\t\t\t\t\twhether we should suppose that there is some substance which exists\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately besides sensible substances (i.e. the substances of our\n\t\t\t\t\tworld), or that the latter constitute reality, and that it is with\n\t\t\t\t\tthem that Wisdom is concerned. It  that we are\n\t\t\t\t\tlooking for some other kind of substance, and that this is the object\n\t\t\t\t\tof our undertaking: I mean, to see whether there is anything which\n\t\t\t\t\texists separately and independently, and does not appertain to any\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible thing.But again,\n\t\t\t\t\tif there is another kind of substance besides sensible substances, to\n\t\t\t\t\twhat kind of sensible things are we to suppose that it corresponds?\n\t\t\t\t\tWhy should we suppose that it corresponds to men or horses rather than\n\t\t\t\t\tto other animals, or even to inanimate objects in general? And yet to\n\t\t\t\t\tmanufacture a set of eternal substances equal in number to those which\n\t\t\t\t\tare sensible and perishable would seem to fall outside the bounds of\n\t\t\t\t\tplausibility.Yet if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe principle which we are now seeking does not exist in separation\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom bodies,what can we\n\t\t\t\t\tsuppose it to be if not matter? Yes, but matter does not exist\n\t\t\t\t\tactually, but only potentially. It might seem rather that a more\n\t\t\t\t\tappropriate principle would be form or shape; but this is\n\t\t\t\t\tperishable; and so in general there is no eternal substance\n\t\t\t\t\twhich exists separately and independently.But this is absurd, because it seems natural\n\t\t\t\t\tthat there should be a substance and principle of this kind, and it is\n\t\t\t\t\tsought for as existing by nearly all the most enlightened thinkers.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor how can there be any order in the universe if there is not\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething eternal and separate and permanent? Again,\n\t\t\t\t\tif there is a substance and principle of such a nature as that which\n\t\t\t\t\twe are now seeking, and if it is one for all things, i.e. the same for\n\t\t\t\t\tboth eternal and perishable things, it is a difficult question as to\n\t\t\t\t\twhy, when the principle is the same, some of the things which come\n\t\t\t\t\tunder that principle are eternal, and others not; for this is\n\t\t\t\t\tparadoxical. But if there is one principle of perishable\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, and another of eternal things, if the principle of perishable\n\t\t\t\t\tthings is also eternal, we shall still have the same difficulty;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause if the principle is eternal, why are not the things which come\n\t\t\t\t\tunder that principle eternal? And if it is perishable, it must have\n\t\t\t\t\tanother principle behind it, and that principle must have another\n\t\t\t\t\tbehind it; and the process will go on to infinity. On the\n\t\t\t\t\tother hand, if we posit the principles which seem most unchangeable,\n\t\t\t\t\tBeing and Unity,(a) unless each of them denotes a\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular thing and a substance, how can they be\n\t\t\t\t\tseparate and independent? but the eternal and primary principles for\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we are looking are of this nature.(b) If, however, each of them denotes a\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular thing and a substance, then all existing things are\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances; for Being is predicated of everything, and Unity also of\n\t\t\t\t\tsome things.But that all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are substances is false. (c) As for those who maintain that\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity is the first principle and a substance, and who generate number\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom Unity and matter as their first product, and assert that it is a\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, how can their theory be true? How are we to conceive of 2\n\t\t\t\t\tand each of the other numbers thus composed, as one? On this point\n\t\t\t\t\tthey give no explanation; nor is it easy to give one. But\n\t\t\t\t\tif we posit lines or the things derived from them (I mean surfaces in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe primary sense) as principles, these at least are not separately\n\t\t\t\t\texisting substances, but sections and divisions, the former of\n\t\t\t\t\tsurfaces and the latter of bodies (and points are sections and\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisions of lines); and further they are limits of these same things.\n\t\t\t\t\tAll these things are integral parts of something else, and not one of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem exists separately.Further, how are we to suppose that there is a substance of unity or\n\t\t\t\t\ta point? for in the case of every substance there is a process ofgeneration, but in the case of the point there is not; for the point\n\t\t\t\t\tis a division.It is a perplexing fact also that\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas every science treats of universals and types, substance is not\n\t\t\t\t\ta universal thing, but rather a particular and separable thing; so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat if there is a science that deals with first principles, how can\n\t\t\t\t\twe suppose that substance is a first principle? Again, is there anything besides the concrete whole (I mean the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter and the form in combination) or not? If not, all things in the nature of matter are\n\t\t\t\t\tperishable; but if there is something, it must be the form or shape.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is hard to determine in what cases this is possible and in what it\n\t\t\t\t\tis not; for in some cases, e.g. that of a house, the form clearly does\n\t\t\t\t\tnot exist in separation.Again, are the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst principles formally or numerically the same? If they are numerically one, all things will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe the same. Since the science of the philosopher is\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerned with Being  Being\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversally, and not with some part of\n\t\t\t\t\tit, and since the term Being has several meanings and is not used only\n\t\t\t\t\tin one sense, if it is merely equivocal and has no common significance\n\t\t\t\t\tit cannot fall under one science (for there is no one class in things\n\t\t\t\t\tof this kind); but if it has a common significance it must fall under\n\t\t\t\t\tone science. Now it would seem that it is used in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsense which we have described, like \"medical\" and \"healthy,\" for we\n\t\t\t\t\tuse each of these terms in several senses; and\n\t\t\t\t\teach is used in this way because it has a reference, one to the\n\t\t\t\t\tscience of medicine, and another to health, and another to something\n\t\t\t\t\telse; but each refers always to the same concept. A diagnosis and a\n\t\t\t\t\tscalpel are both called medical, because the one proceeds from medical\n\t\t\t\t\tscience and the other is useful to it.The same is true of \"healthy\"; one thing is so\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled because it is indicative, and another because it is productive,\n\t\t\t\t\tof health; and the same applies to all other cases. Now it is in this\n\t\t\t\t\tsame way that everything which exists is said to  ;\n\t\t\t\t\teach thing is said to be because it is a modification or permanent or\n\t\t\t\t\ttemporary state or motion or some other such affection of Being  Being.And since everything that is can be referred\n\t\t\t\t\tto some one common concept, each of the contrarieties too can be\n\t\t\t\t\treferred to the primary differentiae and contrarieties of\n\t\t\t\t\tBeingwhether the primary differentiae of Being are\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality and unity, or similarity and dissimilarity, or something\n\t\t\t\t\telse; for we may take them as already discussed. It makes no difference whether that which\n\t\t\t\t\t is referred to Being or Unity; for even if they\n\t\t\t\t\tare not the same but different, they are in any case convertible,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince that which is one also in a sense  , and that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich  is one. Now since the study of\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries pertains to one and the same science,and each contrary is so called in\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue of privation (although indeed one might wonder in what sense\n\t\t\t\t\tthey can be called contraries in virtue of privation when they admit\n\t\t\t\t\tof a middle terme.g. \"unjust\" and \"just\"), in all such\n\t\t\t\t\tcases we must regard the privation as being not of the whole\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition but of the ultimate species. E.g., if the just man is \"one\n\t\t\t\t\twho is obedient to the laws in virtue of some volitional state,\" the\n\t\t\t\t\tunjust man will not be entirely deprived of the whole definition, but\n\t\t\t\t\twill be \"one who is in some respect deficient in obedience to the\n\t\t\t\t\tlaws\"; and it is in this respect that the privation of justice will\n\t\t\t\t\tapply to him (and the same holds good in all other cases).And just as the mathematician\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes a study of abstractions (for in his investigations he first\n\t\t\t\t\tabstracts everything that is sensible, such as weight and lightness,\n\t\t\t\t\thardness and its contrary, and also heat and cold and all other\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible contrarieties, leaving only quantity and\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinuitysometimes in one, sometimes in two and sometimes\n\t\t\t\t\tin three dimensionsand their affections  quantitative and continuous, and does not study them\n\t\t\t\t\twith respect to any other thing; and in some cases investigates the\n\t\t\t\t\trelative positions of things and the properties of these, and in others their commensurability or\n\t\t\t\t\tincommensurability, and in others their ratios; yet nevertheless we\n\t\t\t\t\thold that there is one and the same science of all these things, viz.\n\t\t\t\t\tgeometry), so it is the same with regard to Being.For the study of its attributes in so\n\t\t\t\t\tfar as it is Being, and of its contrarieties\n\t\t\t\t\t Being, belongs to no other science than\n\t\t\t\t\tPhilosophy; for to physics one would assign the study of things not\n\t\t\t\t\t Being but \n\t\t\t\t\tparticipating in motion, while dialectics and sophistry deal with the\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes of existing things, but not of things  Being, nor do they treat of Being itself in so far as it is\n\t\t\t\t\tBeing.Therefore it\n\t\t\t\t\tremains that the philosopher is the man who studies the things which\n\t\t\t\t\twe have described, in so far as they are Being. And since everything\n\t\t\t\t\tthat  , although the term has several meanings, is so\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribed in virtue of some one common concept, and the same is true\n\t\t\t\t\tof the contraries (since they can be referred to the primary\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrarieties and differences of Being), and since things of this kind\n\t\t\t\t\tcan fall under one science, the difficulty which we stated at the\n\t\t\t\t\tbeginning may be regarded as\n\t\t\t\t\tsolvedI mean the problem as to\n\t\t\t\t\thow there can be one science of several things which are different in\n\t\t\t\t\tgenus. Since even the mathematician uses the common\n\t\t\t\t\taxioms only in a particular application, it will be the province of\n\t\t\t\t\tPrimary Philosophy to study the principles of these as well.That when equals are taken from equals the remainders are equal is\n\t\t\t\t\tan axiom common to all quantities; but mathematics isolates a\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular part of its proper subject matter and studies it\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately; e.g. lines or angles or numbers or some other kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tquantity, but not  Being, but only in so far\n\t\t\t\t\tas each of them is continuous in one, two or three dimensions. But\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophy does not investigate particular things in so far as each of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem has some definite attribute, but studies that which\n\t\t\t\t\t , in so far as each particular thing \n\t\t\t\t\t.The same applies to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe science of physics as to mathematics, for physics studies the\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes and first principles of things \n\t\t\t\t\tin motion, and not  Being; but Primary\n\t\t\t\t\tScience, as we have said, deals with these things only in so far as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe subjects which underlie them are existent, and not in respect of\n\t\t\t\t\tanything else. Hence we should regard both physics and mathematics as\n\t\t\t\t\tsubdivisions of Wisdom. There is a principle in\n\t\t\t\t\texisting things about which we cannot make a mistake; of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich, on the contrary, we must always realize the\n\t\t\t\t\ttruthviz. that the same thing cannot at one and the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime be and not be, nor admit of any other similar\n\t\t\t\t\tpair of opposites. Of such axioms although there is a proof ad\n\t\t\t\t\thominem, there is no absolute proof;because there is no principle more convincing\n\t\t\t\t\tthan the axiom itself on which to base an argument, whereas there must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe such a principle if there is to be absolute proof. But he who wants to convince\n\t\t\t\t\tan opponent who makes opposite statements that he is wrong must obtain\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom him an admission which shall be identical with the proposition\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the same thing cannot at one and the same time be and not be, but\n\t\t\t\t\tshall seem not to be identical with it. This is the only method of\n\t\t\t\t\tproof which can be used against one who maintains that opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tstatements can be truly made about the same subject.Now those who intend to join in\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussion must understand one another to some extent; for without\n\t\t\t\t\tthis how can there be any common discussion between them? Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\teach of the terms which they use must be intelligible and signify\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething; not several things, but one only; or if it signifies more\n\t\t\t\t\tthan one thing, it must be made clear to which of these the term is\n\t\t\t\t\tapplied.Now he who\n\t\t\t\t\tsays that A is and is not denies what he asserts, and therefore denies\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the term signifies what it does signify. But this is impossible.\n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore if \"to be so-and-so\" has a definite meaning, the opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement about the same subject cannot be true. Again, if the\n\t\t\t\t\tterm has a definite significance and this is truly stated, it must of\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity be so. But that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich of necessity is can never not be. Hence opposite statements\n\t\t\t\t\tabout the same subject cannot be true.Again, if the assertion is no more true than the negation, it will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe no more true to say \"A is man\" than to say \"A is not man.\" But it\n\t\t\t\t\twould also be admitted that it is more or at least not less true to\n\t\t\t\t\tsay that a man is not a horse than to say that he is not a man; and\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, since it was assumed that opposite statements are equally\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue, it will be true to say that the same person is also a horse. It\n\t\t\t\t\tfollows therefore, that the same person is a man and a horse, or any\n\t\t\t\t\tother animal. Thus, although there is no absolute proof of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese axioms, there is an ad hominem proof where one's opponent makes\n\t\t\t\t\tthese assumptions. Perhaps even\n\t\t\t\t\tHeraclitus himself, if he had been questioned on these lines, would\n\t\t\t\t\thave been compelled to admit that opposite statements can never be\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue of the same subjects; as it is, he adopted this theory through\n\t\t\t\t\tignorance of what his doctrine implied.In general, if what he says is true, not even this\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement itself (I mean \"that the same thing can at one\n\t\t\t\t\tand the same time be and not be\") will be true;because just as, when they are\n\t\t\t\t\tseparated, the affirmation is no more true than the negation, so in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same way, if the complex statement is taken as a single\n\t\t\t\t\taffirmation, the negation will be just as true as the whole statement\n\t\t\t\t\tregarded as an affirmation.And further, if nothing can be truly affirmed, then this very\n\t\t\t\t\tstatementthat there is no such thing as a true\n\t\t\t\t\taffirmationwill be false. But if there is such a thing, the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontentions of those who raise objections of this kind and utterly\n\t\t\t\t\tdestroy rational discourse may be considered to be refuted. Very similar to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe views which we have just mentioned is the dictum of\n\t\t\t\t\tProtagoras; for he said that man is the measure of\n\t\t\t\t\tall things, by which he meant simply that each individual's\n\t\t\t\t\timpressions are positively true.But if this is so, it follows that the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is and is not, and is bad and good, and that all the other\n\t\t\t\t\timplications of opposite statements are true; because often a given\n\t\t\t\t\tthing seems beautiful to one set of people and ugly to another, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which seems to each individual is the measure. This difficulty will be solved if we consider\n\t\t\t\t\tthe origin of the assumption. It seems probable that it arose in some\n\t\t\t\t\tcases from the doctrine of the natural philosophers, and in others\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the fact that everyone does not form the same opinion about the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame things, but to some a given thing seems sweet and to others the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary.For that\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing comes from what is not, but everything from what is, is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdoctrine common to nearly all natural philosophers. Since, then, a thing\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not become white which was before completely white and in no\n\t\t\t\t\trespect not-white, that which becomes white must come from what was\n\t\t\t\t\tnot-white. Hence according to this theory there would be generation\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom what is not, unless the same thing were originally white\n\t\t\t\t\t not-white.However, it is not hard to solve this\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty. We have explained in the  in what sense\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which are generated are generated from what is not, and in what\n\t\t\t\t\tsense from what is.But to attach equal\n\t\t\t\t\timportance to the opinions and impressions of opposing parties is\n\t\t\t\t\tfoolish, because clearly one side or the other must be wrong. This is evident from what happens in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsphere of sensation; for the same thing never seems to\n\t\t\t\t\tsome people sweet and to others to the contrary unless one of the\n\t\t\t\t\tparties has the organ of sense which distinguishes the said flavors\n\t\t\t\t\tinjured or impaired. Such being the case, the one party should be\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken as the \"measure,\" and the other not.And I hold the same in the case of good and\n\t\t\t\t\tbad, and of beautiful and ugly, and of all other such qualities. For\n\t\t\t\t\tto maintain this view is just the same\n\t\t\t\t\tas to maintain that what appears to us when we press the finger below\n\t\t\t\t\tthe eye and make a thing seem two instead of one must be two because\n\t\t\t\t\tit appears to be so, and then afterwards that it must be one; because\n\t\t\t\t\tif we do not interfere with our sight that which is one appears to be\n\t\t\t\t\tone.And in general\n\t\t\t\t\tit is absurd to form our opinion of the truth from the appearances of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings in this world of ours which are subject to change and never\n\t\t\t\t\tremain in the same state; for it is by reference to those things which are\n\t\t\t\t\talways the same state and undergo no change that we should prosecute\n\t\t\t\t\tour search for truth.Of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis kind are the heavenly bodies; for these do not appear to be now\n\t\t\t\t\tof one nature and subsequently of another, but are manifestly always\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same and have no change of any kind.Again, if there is motion there is also something which is moved;\n\t\t\t\t\tand everything is moved from something and into something. Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is moved must be in that from which it is to be\n\t\t\t\t\tmoved,and must also\n\t\t\t\t\tnot be in it; and must be moved into so-and-so and must also come to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe in it; but the contradictory statements cannot be true at the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime, as our opponents allege.And if the things of our world are in a state\n\t\t\t\t\tof continuous flux and motion in respect of quantity, and we assume\n\t\t\t\t\tthis although it is not true, why should they not be constant in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect of quality? It appears\n\t\t\t\t\tthat not the least reason why our opponents predicate opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tstatements of the same thing is that they start with the assumption\n\t\t\t\t\tthat quantity is not constant in the case of bodies; hence they say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the same thing is and is not six feet long.But essence depends upon quality, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is of a determinate, whereas quantity is of an indeterminate\n\t\t\t\t\tnature.Again, when the doctor\n\t\t\t\t\torders them to adopt some article of diet, why do they adopt it? For on their view it is no more\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue that a thing is bread than that it is not; and therefore it would\n\t\t\t\t\tmake no difference whether they ate it or not. But as it is, they\n\t\t\t\t\tadopt a particular food as though they knew the truth about it and it\n\t\t\t\t\twere the food prescribed;yet they ought not to do so if there were no fixed and permanent\n\t\t\t\t\tnature in sensible things and everything were always in a state of\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion and flux.Again, if we are always\n\t\t\t\t\tchanging and never remain the same, is it any wonder that to us, as to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe diseased, things never appear the same?\n\t\t\t\t\t For\n\t\t\t\t\tto the diseased, since they are not in the same physical condition as\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they were well, sensible qualities do not appear to be the same;\n\t\t\t\t\talthough this does not mean that the sensible things themselves\n\t\t\t\t\tpartake of any change, but that they cause different, and not the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame, sensations in the diseased. Doubtless the same must be true if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe change which we have referred to takes place in us.If, however, we do not change\n\t\t\t\t\tbut remain always the same, there must be something\n\t\t\t\t\tpermanent.As for those who raise\n\t\t\t\t\tthe aforesaid difficulties on dialectical grounds, it is not easy to find a\n\t\t\t\t\tsolution which will convince them unless they grant some assumption\n\t\t\t\t\tfor which they no longer require an explanation; for every argument\n\t\t\t\t\tand proof is possible only in this way. If they grant no assumption,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey destroy discussion and reasoning in general.Thus there is no arguing with people of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis kind; but in the case of those who are perplexed by the\n\t\t\t\t\ttraditional difficulties it is easy to meet and refute the causes of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir perplexity. This is evident from what has been already\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid. Thus from these considerations it is obvious\n\t\t\t\t\tthat opposite statements cannot be true of the same thing at one time;\n\t\t\t\t\tnor can contrary statements, since every contrariety involves\n\t\t\t\t\tprivation. This is clear if we reduce the formulae of contraries to\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir first principles.Similarly no\n\t\t\t\t\tmiddle term can be predicated of one and the same thingof which one of the contraries\n\t\t\t\t\tis predicated. If, when the subject is white, we say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is neither white nor black, we shall be in error; for it\n\t\t\t\t\tfollows that it is and is not white, because the first of the two\n\t\t\t\t\tterms in the complex statement will be true of the subject, and this\n\t\t\t\t\tis the contradictory of white.Thus we\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot be right in holding the views either of Heraclitus or of Anaxagoras. If we could, it would follow that contraries\n\t\t\t\t\tare predicable of the same subject; for when he says that in everything there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tpart of everything, he means that nothing is sweet any more than it is\n\t\t\t\t\tbitter, and similarly with any of the other pairs of contraries; that\n\t\t\t\t\tis, if everything is present in everything not merely potentially but\n\t\t\t\t\tactually and in differentiation. Similarly\n\t\t\t\t\t statements cannot be false, nor all true. Among\n\t\t\t\t\tmany other difficulties which might be adduced as involved by this\n\t\t\t\t\tsupposition there is the objection that if all statements were false,\n\t\t\t\t\tnot even this proposition itself would be true; while if they were all\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue it would not be false to say that they are all false.\n\t\t\t\t\tEvery science inquires for certain principles and causes with respect\n\t\t\t\t\tto every knowable thing which comes within its scope;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g., the sciences of medicine and\n\t\t\t\t\tphysical culture do this, and so does each of the other productive and\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical sciences. Each one of these marks out for itself some\n\t\t\t\t\tclass of objects, and concerns itself with this as with something\n\t\t\t\t\texistent and real, but not  real; it is\n\t\t\t\t\tanother science distinct from these which does this.Each of the said sciences arrives in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome way at the essence in a particular class of things, and then\n\t\t\t\t\ttries to prove the rest more or less exactly. Some arrive at the\n\t\t\t\t\tessence through sense-perception, and some by hypothesis; hence it is\n\t\t\t\t\tobvious from such a process of induction that there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstration of the reality or essence. Now since there\n\t\t\t\t\tis a science of nature, clearly it must be different from both\n\t\t\t\t\tpractical and productive science. In a productive science the source\n\t\t\t\t\tof motion is in the producer and not in the thing produced, and is\n\t\t\t\t\teither an art or some other kind of potency; and similarly in a\n\t\t\t\t\tpractical science the motion is not in the thing acted upon but rather\n\t\t\t\t\tin the agent.But the\n\t\t\t\t\tscience of the natural philosopher is concerned with things which\n\t\t\t\t\tcontain in themselves a source of motion. From this it is clear that\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural science must be neither practical nor productive, but\n\t\t\t\t\tspeculative; since it must fall under one of these classes.And since every science must\n\t\t\t\t\thave some knowledge of the essenceand must use it as a starting-point, we must be\n\t\t\t\t\tcareful to observe how the natural philosopher should define, and how\n\t\t\t\t\the should regard the formula of essencewhether in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tway as the term \"snub,\" or rather as the term \"concave.\"For of these the formula of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"snub\" is stated in conjunction with the matter of the object, whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of \"concave\" is stated apart from the matter; since snubness is\n\t\t\t\t\tonly found in the nose, which is therefore included in the formula,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor \"the snub\" is a concave  . Thus it is obvious\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the formula of \"flesh\" and \"eye\" and the other parts of the body\n\t\t\t\t\tmust always be stated in conjunction with their matter.\n\t\t\t\t\tSince there is a science of Being  Being and\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately existent, we must inquire whether this should be regarded\n\t\t\t\t\tas identical with natural science or rather as a distinct branch of\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge. Physics deals with things which contain a source of motion\n\t\t\t\t\tin themselves, and mathematics is speculative and is a science which\n\t\t\t\t\tdeals with permanent things, but not with things which can exist\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately.Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is a science distinct from both of these, which deals with that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich exists separately and is immovable; that is, if there really is\n\t\t\t\t\ta substance of this kindI mean separately existent and\n\t\t\t\t\timmovableas we shall endeavor to prove. And if there is an entity of this kind in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe world of reality, here surely must be the Divine, and this must be\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first and most fundamental principle.  Evidently, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are three kinds of speculative science: physics, mathematics,\n\t\t\t\t\tand theology. The highest class of science is the speculative, and of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe speculative sciences themselves the highest is the last named,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause it deals with the most important side of reality; and each\n\t\t\t\t\tscience is reckoned higher or lower in accordance with the object of\n\t\t\t\t\tits study.The question might be raised\n\t\t\t\t\tas to whether the science of Being  Being\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be regarded as universal or not.Each of the mathematical sciences deals with\n\t\t\t\t\tsome one class of things which is determinate, but universal\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematics is common to all alike. If, then, natural substances are\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first of existing things, physics will be the first of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsciences; but if there is some other nature and substance which exists\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately and is immovable, then the science which treats of it must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe different from and prior to physics, and universal because of its\n\t\t\t\t\tpriority. Since the term Being in its\n\t\t\t\t\tunqualified sense is used with several meanings, of which one is\n\t\t\t\t\taccidental Being, we must first consider Being in this sense.\n\t\t\t\t\tClearly none of the traditional sciences concerns itself with the\n\t\t\t\t\taccidental; the science of building does not consider what will happen\n\t\t\t\t\tto the occupants of the house,e.g. whether they will find it unpleasant or the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to live in; nor does the science of weaving or of shoemaking\n\t\t\t\t\tor of confectionery.Each\n\t\t\t\t\tof these sciences considers only what is proper to it, i.e. its\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular end. As for the question whether \"the cultured\" is also\n\t\t\t\t\t\"the lettered,\" or the quibble that \"the man who is cultured, when he has become\n\t\t\t\t\tlettered, will be both at once although he was not before; but that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is but was not always so must have come to be; therefore he must\n\t\t\t\t\thave become at the same time cultured and lettered\"none of the recognized\n\t\t\t\t\tsciences considers this, except sophistry. This is the only science\n\t\t\t\t\twhich concerns itself with the accidental, and hence Plato was not far\n\t\t\t\t\twrong in saying that the sophist spends\n\t\t\t\t\this time in the study of unreality. But that it is not even possible\n\t\t\t\t\tfor there to be a science of the accidental will be apparent if we try\n\t\t\t\t\tto see what the accidental really is. Of some things we\n\t\t\t\t\tsay that they are so always and of necessity (necessity having the\n\t\t\t\t\tsense not of compulsion, but that which we use in logical\n\t\t\t\t\tdemonstration), and of others\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they are so usually, but of others that they are so neither\n\t\t\t\t\tusually nor always and of necessity, but fortuitously. E.g., there\n\t\t\t\t\tmight be a frost at midsummer, although this comes about neither\n\t\t\t\t\talways and of necessity nor usually; but it\n\t\t\t\t\tmight happen sometimes.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe accidental, then, is that which comes about, but not always nor of\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity nor usually. Thus we have now stated what the accidental is;\n\t\t\t\t\tand it is obvious why there can be no science of such a thing, because\n\t\t\t\t\tevery science has as its object that which is so always or usually,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the accidental falls under neither of these\n\t\t\t\t\tdescriptions. Clearly there can be no causes and\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples of the accidental such as there are of that which is per\n\t\t\t\t\tse; otherwise everything would be of necessity. For if A is when B is,\n\t\t\t\t\tand B is when C is, and C is not fortuitously but of necessity, then\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of which C was the cause will also be of necessity, and so on\n\t\t\t\t\tdown to the last  , as it is called.(But this was assumed to be\n\t\t\t\t\taccidental.) Therefore everything will be of necessity, and the\n\t\t\t\t\telement of chance, i.e. the possibility of a thing's either happening\n\t\t\t\t\tor not, is entirely banished from the world of events. Even if we\n\t\t\t\t\tsuppose the cause not to exist already but to be coming to be, the\n\t\t\t\t\tresult will be the same; for everything will come to be of\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity.The\n\t\t\t\t\teclipse tomorrow will come about if A does, and A will if B does, and\n\t\t\t\t\tB if C does; and in this way if we keep on subtracting time from the\n\t\t\t\t\tfinite time between now and to-morrow, we shall at some point arrive\n\t\t\t\t\tat the present existing condition.Therefore since this exists, everything subsequent\n\t\t\t\t\tto it will happen of necessity, and so everything happens of\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessity. As for \"what is\" in the sense of what\n\t\t\t\t\tis  or what is  , the former\n\t\t\t\t\tdepends upon a combination in thought, and is an affection of thought\n\t\t\t\t\t(hence we do not look for the principles of Being in this sense, but\n\t\t\t\t\tonly for those of objective and separable Being) the latter is not\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary but indeterminate (I mean the accidental); and of such a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing the causes are indefinite and cannot be reduced to a\n\t\t\t\t\tsystem. Teleology is found in events which come about\n\t\t\t\t\tin the course of nature or as a result of thought. It is\n\t\t\t\t\t\"chance\" <or \"luck\"> when one of these comes about by\n\t\t\t\t\taccident; for a thing may be a cause, just as it may exist, either per\n\t\t\t\t\tse or accidentally. Chance is an accidental cause of normally\n\t\t\t\t\tpurposive teleological events.Hence chance and thought have the same sphere\n\t\t\t\t\tof action, for there is no purpose without thought. Causes from which\n\t\t\t\t\tchance results may come about are indeterminate; hence chance is\n\t\t\t\t\tinscrutable to human calculation, and is a cause only accidentally,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut in the strictest sense is a cause of nothing.It is \"good\" or \"bad luck\" when the\n\t\t\t\t\tresult is good or bad, and \"good\" or \"bad fortune\" when\n\t\t\t\t\tthe result is on a large scale.Since\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing accidental is prior to that which is per se, neither are\n\t\t\t\t\taccidental causes prior. Therefore if chance or spontaneity is the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause of the universe, mind and nature are prior causes. A thing may exist\n\t\t\t\t\tonly actually or potentially, or actually and potentially; it may be a\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance or a quantity or one of the other categories. There is no\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion\n\t\t\t\t\tapart from things, for change is always in accordance with the\n\t\t\t\t\tcategories of Being; and there is nothing which is common to these and in\n\t\t\t\t\tno one category. Each category belongs to all its members in two\n\t\t\t\t\twayse.g. substance, for this is sometimes the form of the\n\t\t\t\t\tthing and sometimes its privation;and as regards quality there is white and\n\t\t\t\t\tblack; and as regards quantity, complete and incomplete; and as\n\t\t\t\t\tregards spatial motion there is up and down or light and\n\t\t\t\t\theavyso that there are as many forms of motion and change\n\t\t\t\t\tas there are of Being.Now since every kind of thing is divided into the\n\t\t\t\t\tpotential and the real, I call the actualization of the potential as\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch,\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion.That this is\n\t\t\t\t\ta true statement will be clear from what follows. When the \"buildable\"\n\t\t\t\t\tin the sense in which we call it such exists actually, it is being\n\t\t\t\t\tbuilt; and this is the process of building. The same is true of the\n\t\t\t\t\tprocesses of learning, healing, walking,jumping, ageing, maturing. Motion results when the\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete reality itself exists, and neither sooner nor\n\t\t\t\t\tlater.The complete\n\t\t\t\t\treality, then, of that which exists potentially, when it is completely\n\t\t\t\t\treal and actual, not  itself but  movable, is motion. By  I mean this. The bronze is potentially a statue; but\n\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless the complete reality of the bronze  bronze is not motion. To be bronze is not the same as to be\n\t\t\t\t\ta particular potentiality; since if it were absolutely the same by\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition the complete reality of the bronze would be a kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion; but it is not the same.(This is obvious in the case of contraries;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the potentiality for health and the potentiality for illness are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot the samefor if they were, health and illness would be\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same toobut the substrate which becomes healthy or ill,\n\t\t\t\t\twhether it is moisture or blood, is one and the same.) And since it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot the same, just as \"color\" and \"visible\" are not the same, it is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe complete reality of the potential \n\t\t\t\t\tpotential that is motion.It is evident that it is this, and that motion results when the\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete reality itself exists, and neither sooner nor later.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor everything may sometimes be actual,\n\t\t\t\t\tand sometimes not; e.g. the \"buildable\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\"buildable\"; and the actualization of the \"buildable\"  \"buildable\" is the act of\n\t\t\t\t\tbuilding.For the\n\t\t\t\t\tactualization is either thisthe act of\n\t\t\t\t\tbuildingor a house. But when the house exists, it will no\n\t\t\t\t\tlonger be buildable; the buildable is that which is \n\t\t\t\t\tbuilt. Hence the actualization must be the act of building, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tact of building is a kind of motion. The same argument applies to the\n\t\t\t\t\tother kinds of motion. That this account is correct\n\t\t\t\t\tis clear from what the other authorities say about motion, and from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe fact that it is not easy to define it otherwise. For one thing, it\n\t\t\t\t\tcould not be placed in any other class; this is clear from the fact\n\t\t\t\t\tthat some people identify it\n\t\t\t\t\twith otherness and inequality and not-being, none of which is\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily moved;moreover\n\t\t\t\t\tchange is no more into these or out of them than into or out of their\n\t\t\t\t\topposites. The reason for placing motion in this class\n\t\t\t\t\tis that it is considered to be indeterminate, and the principles in\n\t\t\t\t\tone of the columns of contraries are indeterminate, being privative;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor none of them is a determinate thing or quality or any of the other\n\t\t\t\t\tcategories.The\n\t\t\t\t\treason for considering motion to be indeterminate is that it cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\tassociated either with the potentiality or with the actuality of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings; for neither that which is potentiallynor that which is actually of a certain\n\t\t\t\t\tsize is necessarily moved.And motion is considered to be a kind of actualization, but\n\t\t\t\t\tincomplete; the reason of this is that the\n\t\t\t\t\tpotential, of which it is the actualization, is incomplete.Thus it is difficult to comprehend what\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion is; for we must associate it either with privation or with\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality or with absolute actuality; and apparently none of these\n\t\t\t\t\tis possible.There\n\t\t\t\t\tremains, then, the account which we have given; that it is an\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality, and an actuality of the kind which we have described, which\n\t\t\t\t\tis hard to visualize but capable of existing.That motion is in the movable is evident; for it is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe complete realization of the movable by that which is capable of\n\t\t\t\t\tcausing motion, and the actualization of that which is capable of\n\t\t\t\t\tcausing motion is identical with that of the movable.For it must be a complete\n\t\t\t\t\trealization of them both; since a thing is capable of moving because\n\t\t\t\t\tit has the potentiality, but it moves only when it is active; but it\n\t\t\t\t\tis upon the movable that it is capable of acting. Thus the actuality\n\t\t\t\t\tof both alike is one; just as there is the same interval from one to\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo as from two to one, and the hill up and the hill down are one,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough their  is not one; the case of the mover\n\t\t\t\t\tand the thing moved is similar.The infinite is either (a) that which\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot be traversed because it is not its nature to be traversed (just\n\t\t\t\t\tas sound is by nature invisible); or (b) that which admits of an\n\t\t\t\t\tendless traverse; or (c) scarcely admits of traverse; or (d) which,\n\t\t\t\t\tthough it would naturally admit of traverse or limit, does not do so.\n\t\t\t\t\tFurther, it may be infinite in respect\n\t\t\t\t\tof addition or of subtraction or of both.That the infinite should be a separate independent entity, and yet imperceptible, is impossible.For if it is neither magnitude\n\t\t\t\t\tnor plurality, but infinity itself is the essence of it, and not\n\t\t\t\t\tmerely an accident, it must be indivisible; because that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisible is either magnitude or plurality. And if it is indivisible\n\t\t\t\t\tit cannot be infinite, except in the same way as sound is invisible.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut this is not what people mean by infinite; and it is not the\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite in this sense that we are investigating, but the infinite in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sense of the untraversable. Again, how can\n\t\t\t\t\tthe infinite exist independently unless number and magnitude, of which\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinity is an attribute, also exist independently? And\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther, if the infinite is accidental, it cannot,  infinite, be an element of things; just as the\n\t\t\t\t\tinvisible is not an element of speech, although sound is invisible. It\n\t\t\t\t\tis clear also that the infinite cannot exist actually.Otherwise any part of it which\n\t\t\t\t\twe might take would be infinite; for infinity and the infinite are the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame, if the infinite is substance and is not predicated of a subject.\n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore it is either indivisible, or if it is partible, the parts\n\t\t\t\t\tinto which it is divisible are infinite. But the same thing cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\tmany infinites; for just as a part of air is air, so a part of the\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite will be infinite, if the infinite is a substance and\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple.Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tit is impartible and indivisible. But this is impossible of the\n\t\t\t\t\tactually infinite, because it must be some quantity. Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinity is an accidental attribute. But if so,as we have said, it cannot be it that\n\t\t\t\t\tis a principle, but that of which it is an accident: air or \"the even.\"The foregoing inquiry is general; but what\n\t\t\t\t\tfollows will show that the infinite does not exist in sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings.If the\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinition of a body is \"that which is bounded by surfaces,\" then no\n\t\t\t\t\tbody, whether sensible or intelligible, can be infinite nor can there\n\t\t\t\t\tbe any separate and infinite number, since number or that which\n\t\t\t\t\tinvolves number is numerable. This is clearly shown by the following\n\t\t\t\t\tconcrete argument. The infinite can neither be composite nor simple.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor (a) it cannot be a composite body if the elements are limited in\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber;for the contraries must be equal, and no one of them must be\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite; for if the potency of one of the two corporeal elements is\n\t\t\t\t\tin any way inferior, the finite element will be destroyed by the\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite. And every element cannot be infinite, because body is that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich has extension in all directions, and the infinite is that which\n\t\t\t\t\tis extended without limit; so that if the infinite is corporeal it\n\t\t\t\t\twill be infinite in all directions. Nor (b)\n\t\t\t\t\tcan the infinite be any simple body; neither, as some hold, something which\n\t\t\t\t\tis apart from the elements and from which they suppose the elements to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe generated (for there is no such body apart from the elements;\n\t\t\t\t\teverything can be resolved into that of which it consists, but we do\n\t\t\t\t\tnot see things resolved into anything apart from the simple bodies),\n\t\t\t\t\tnor fire nor any other\n\t\t\t\t\telement.Apart from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe question of how any of them could be infinite, the All, even if it\n\t\t\t\t\tis finite, cannot be or become any one of the elements, as Heraclitus\n\t\t\t\t\tsays all things\n\t\t\t\t\tat certain times become fire. The same argument applies as to the One\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the physicists posit besides the elements; for all change\n\t\t\t\t\tproceeds from the contrary, e.g. from hot to cold. Again, a sensible body is in\n\t\t\t\t\tsome region, and the region of the whole and of the part (e.g. of the\n\t\t\t\t\tearth) is the same. Therefore if the infinite body is homogeneous, it\n\t\t\t\t\twill be immovable or will always be in motion; but this is impossible,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor why should there be rest or motion below rather than above or in\n\t\t\t\t\tany other region? E.g., if there were a clod, in what region would it\n\t\t\t\t\tmove or be at rest?The\n\t\t\t\t\tregion proper to the body which is homogeneous with the clod is\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite. Then will the clod occupy the whole of that region? How can\n\t\t\t\t\tit? Then what of its rest or motion? It will either rest\n\t\t\t\t\teverywherein which case it cannot moveor move\n\t\t\t\t\teverywhere; in which case it cannot rest. And if the whole is not alike\n\t\t\t\t\tthroughout, the regions proper to its parts are unlike also; and (a)\n\t\t\t\t\tthe body of the whole is not one, except in virtue of contact; (b) the\n\t\t\t\t\tparts will be either finite or infinite in kind.Finite they cannot be, for then those\n\t\t\t\t\tof one kind would be infinite and those of\n\t\t\t\t\tanother would not (if the whole is infinite); e.g., fire or water\n\t\t\t\t\twould be infinite.But such\n\t\t\t\t\ta condition would involve the destruction of the contraries. But if\n\t\t\t\t\tthe parts are infinite and simple, the regions proper to them\n\t\t\t\t\tare infinite and the elements will be infinite. And since this is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible, the regions are finite and the whole must be finite. In general, there cannot be an infinite body  a\n\t\t\t\t\tplace for bodies if every body which is sensible has either weight or\n\t\t\t\t\tlightness; for it will have to move either towards the center or\n\t\t\t\t\tupwards, and the infiniteeither the whole or the\n\t\t\t\t\thalfcannot do either; for how can you divide it? How can\n\t\t\t\t\tthe infinite be part up and part down, or part extreme and part\n\t\t\t\t\tcenter?Further,\n\t\t\t\t\tevery sensible body is in some place, and of place there are six\n\t\t\t\t\tkinds, but these cannot exist in an infinite body. In\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral, if an infinite place is impossible, so is an infinite body;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause that which is in a place is somewhere, and this means either\n\t\t\t\t\tup or down or one of the other kinds of place, and each of these is a\n\t\t\t\t\tlimit. The infinite is not the same in the sense\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is one nature whether it applies to magnitude or to motion or\n\t\t\t\t\tto time; the posterior is derived from the prior sense, e.g. motion is\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled infinite in virtue of the magnitude involved when a thing is\n\t\t\t\t\tmoved or changed or increased, and time is so called on account of\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion.\n\t\t\t\t\t That which changes either changes\n\t\t\t\t\taccidentally, as when \"the cultured\" walks; or is said to change in\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral because something in it changes, as in the case of things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich change in their parts; the body becomes healthy because the eye\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes.But there is\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething which is moved directly per se, i.e. the essentially\n\t\t\t\t\tmovable. The same applies to that which moves, for it moves sometimes\n\t\t\t\t\taccidentally, sometimes partially, and sometimes per se. There is\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething that moves directly, and something that is moved; and also a\n\t\t\t\t\ttime in which, and something from which, and something into which it\n\t\t\t\t\tis moved. But the forms and modifications and place into which moving\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are moved are immovable; e.g. knowledge and warmth. It is not\n\t\t\t\t\twarmth that is motion, but the process of warming.\n\t\t\t\t\tNon-accidental change is not found in all things, but only between\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries and intermediates and contradictories. We can convince\n\t\t\t\t\tourselves of this by means of induction. That which changes changes\n\t\t\t\t\teither from positive into positive, or from negative into negative, or\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom positive into negative, or from negative into positive.By \"positive\" I mean that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is denoted by an affirmation. Thus there must be three forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tchange;for that which\n\t\t\t\t\tis from negative into negative is not change, because they are neither\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries nor contradictories, since they entail no opposition. The\n\t\t\t\t\tchange from the negative into its contradictory positive is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerationabsolute change absolute generation, and\n\t\t\t\t\tqualified change qualified generation; and the change from the\n\t\t\t\t\tpositive to the negative is destructionabsolute change\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolute destruction, and qualified change qualified destruction. Now\n\t\t\t\t\tif \"what is not\" has several meanings, and neither that which implies\n\t\t\t\t\ta combination or separation of terms, nor that which relates to\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality and is opposed to unqualified Being, admits of motion\n\t\t\t\t\t(\"not-white\" or \"not-good,\" however, admits of motion accidentally,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause \"not-white\" may be a man; but that which is \"not so-and-so\" in\n\t\t\t\t\tan absolute sense does not admit of it at all), then \"what is not\"\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot be moved. If this is so, generation cannot be motion; for it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\"what is not\" that is generated.For even if the generation is in the highest\n\t\t\t\t\tdegree accidental, still it is true to say that not-being is\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicable of that which is generated absolutely. And the argument\n\t\t\t\t\tapplies similarly to rest. Thus not only do these difficult\n\t\t\t\t\tconclusions follow, but also that everything which is moved is in a\n\t\t\t\t\tplace, whereas \"what is not\" is not in a place; for then it would\n\t\t\t\t\t somewhere. Nor is destruction motion; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary of motion is motion or rest, but the contrary of destruction\n\t\t\t\t\tis generation.  And since every motion is a kind of change,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the three kinds of change are those which we have described, and of these\n\t\t\t\t\tthose which relate to generation and destruction are not motions, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthese are the changes between contradictories, the change from\n\t\t\t\t\tpositive to positive must alone be motion. The subjects are either\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries or intermediates (for privative terms may also be regarded\n\t\t\t\t\tas contraries) and are denoted by a positive terme.g.\n\t\t\t\t\t\"naked\" or \"toothless\" or \"black.\" Now since the\n\t\t\t\t\tcategories are distinguished as substance, quality, place, activity or\n\t\t\t\t\tpassivity, relation and quantity, there must be three kinds of motion, in respect of\n\t\t\t\t\tquality, quantity and place. There is no motion in respect of substance, because substance has no\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary; nor of the relative, because it is possible that when one of\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo related things changes the relation to it of the other thing, even\n\t\t\t\t\tthough the thing itself does not change, may become untrue; therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tthe motion of these related things is accidental.Nor is there motion of the agent or\n\t\t\t\t\tpatient, or of the mover and the thing moved, because there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion of motion nor no generation of generation, nor in general is\n\t\t\t\t\tthere change of change. There are two ways in which there might be\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion of motion: (1) Motion might be the subject of motion, as, e.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\ta man is moved because he changes from white to black; in this way\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion might be heated or cooled or might change its place or\n\t\t\t\t\tincrease. But this is impossible,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the change is not a subject. Or (2) some other subject might\n\t\t\t\t\tchange from change to some other form of existence, as, e.g., a man\n\t\t\t\t\tchanges from sickness to health. But this is also impossible except\n\t\t\t\t\taccidentally.Every\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion is a change from one thing into something else; and the same is\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue of generation and destruction, except that these are changes into\n\t\t\t\t\topposites in one sense, while the other, i.e. motion, is a\n\t\t\t\t\tchange into opposites in another sense. Hence a thing changes at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same time from health to sickness, and from this change itself\n\t\t\t\t\tinto another.Now clearly\n\t\t\t\t\tif it has fallen ill it will be already changed (for it cannot remain\n\t\t\t\t\tat rest) into that other change, whatever it may be; and further this\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot be, in any given case, any chance change; and it also must be\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom something into something else. Therefore it will be the opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tchange, viz. becoming healthy. But this is so accidentally; just as\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is change from recollecting to forgetting because the\n\t\t\t\t\t changes, now in the direction of knowledge\n\t\t\t\t\tand now in that of ignorance. Further, we shall have an\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite series if there is to be change of change and becoming of\n\t\t\t\t\tbecoming, because if the latter of two becomings comes to be from the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer, the former must come to be too. E.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tif simple becoming was once coming to be, that which comes to be\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething was also once coming to be. Therefore that which simply\n\t\t\t\t\tcomes to be was not yet, but there was already something coming to be\n\t\t\t\t\tcoming to be something.But this too was at one time coming to be, and therefore it was not\n\t\t\t\t\tat that time coming to be something. But in infinite series there is\n\t\t\t\t\tno first term, and therefore in this series the first term cannot\n\t\t\t\t\texist, nor can any subsequent term. Therefore nothing can be either\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated or moved or changed.Further,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same thing which admits of motion admits also of the contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion and of rest, and that which admits of generation admits also of\n\t\t\t\t\tdestruction.Therefore that which comes to be, when it has come to be coming to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe, is then in course of perishing; for it does not\n\t\t\t\t\tperish as soon as it is coming to be coming to be, nor afterwards,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause that which is perishing must  .Further, there must be some matter underlying that which is coming\n\t\t\t\t\tto be or changing. What then will it be? What is it that becomes\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion or generation in the same way as it is body or soul that\n\t\t\t\t\tundergoes change? And moreover what is that which is the terminus of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe motion? For that which we are considering must be a motion or\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration  A  B \n\t\t\t\t\tC.How then can\n\t\t\t\t\tthese conditions be fulfilled? There can be no learning of learning,\n\t\t\t\t\tand therefore there can be no generation of generation.Since there is no motion of substance or of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe relative or of activity and passivity, it remains that there is\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion in respect of quality, quantity and place; for each of these\n\t\t\t\t\tadmits of contrariety. By \"quality\" I mean not that which is in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance (for indeed even the differentia is a quality),but the passive quality in\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue of which a thing is said to be acted upon or to be immune from\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing acted upon. The immovable is either that which is wholly incapable of being\n\t\t\t\t\tmoved, or that which is scarcely moved in the course of a long time or\n\t\t\t\t\tis slow in starting, or that which would naturally be moved but cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tbe moved at the time when and from the place whence and in the way in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it would naturally be moved. This last is the only kind of\n\t\t\t\t\timmovable thing which I recognize as being at rest; for rest is\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to motion, and so must be a privation of that which admits of\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion. Things are \"together in place\" which\n\t\t\t\t\tare in the primary sense in one place, and \"separate\" which are in\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent places. \"Contrary in place\" is that which is at a maximum\n\t\t\t\t\tdistance in a straight line. Things are said to be \"in contact\" whose extremes are\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether in place. An \"intermediate\" is that at which a changing thing\n\t\t\t\t\twhich changes continuously in accordance with its nature naturally\n\t\t\t\t\tarrives before it arrives at the extreme into which it is changing.\n\t\t\t\t\tSince all change takes place between opposites, and these are either\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries or contradictories, and contradictories have no middle\n\t\t\t\t\tterm, clearly it is to the sphere of contraries that the intermediate\n\t\t\t\t\tbelongs. \"Successive\" is that which comes after the beginning (the order\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing determined by position or form or in some other way) and has\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing of the same class between itself and that which it succeeds;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g. lines in the case of a line, and units in that of a unit, and a\n\t\t\t\t\thouse in the case of a house (but there is nothing to prevent\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else from coming between). For that which is successive is a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing which is successive and posterior to some other thing.\n\t\t\t\t\t1 is not successive to 2, nor is the\n\t\t\t\t\tnew moon to the second day of the month.\"Contiguous\" is that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tsuccessive and in contact. The \"continuous\" is a species of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontiguous.I call\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo things continuous when their respective boundaries, by which they\n\t\t\t\t\tare kept together in contact, become one and the same; hence clearly\n\t\t\t\t\tthe continuous belongs to the sphere of things whose nature it is to\n\t\t\t\t\tbecome one by contiguity.Clearly\n\t\t\t\t\t\"successive\" is the most ultimate term; for the successive need not be\n\t\t\t\t\tin contact, but contact implies succession; and if there is continuity\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is contact, but if there is contact there is not necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinuity;and\n\t\t\t\t\twhere there is no contact there is no coalescence. Therefore a point\n\t\t\t\t\tis not the same as a unit; for points admit of contact, whereas units\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not, but only of succession; and between points there is something\n\t\t\t\t\tintermediate, but between units there is not."}}, {"@n": "12", "@type": "Book", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1069a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "18", "@ed": "Bekker", "@unit":

Indeed if the universe is to be regarded as a\n\t\t\t\t\twhole,substance is\n\t\t\t\t\tits first part; and if it is to be regarded as a succession, even so substance is first, then quality, then\n\t\t\t\t\tquantity. Moreover, the latter hardly exist at all in the full sense,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut are merely qualifications and affections of Being. Otherwise\n\t\t\t\t\t\"not-white\" and \"not-straight\" would also exist; at any rate we say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they too \"are,\" e.g., \"it is not white.\"Further, none of the other categories is\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately existent. Even the ancients in effect testify to this, for\n\t\t\t\t\tit was of substance that they sought the principles and elements and\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses. Present-day thinkers tend to regard universals as substance,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause genera are universal, and they hold that these are more truly\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples and substances because they approach the question\n\t\t\t\t\ttheoretically; but the ancients identified substance with particular\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, e.g. fire and earth, and not with body in general.\n\t\t\t\t\tNow there are three kinds of substance. One is \n\t\t\t\t\t(and may be either eternal or perishable; the latter, e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tplants and animals, is universally recognized); of this we must\n\t\t\t\t\tapprehend the elements, whether they are one or many.Another is\n\t\t\t\t\t , which certain thinkers hold to exist\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately; some dividing it into two classes, others combining the\n\t\t\t\t\tForms and the objects of mathematics into a single class, and others\n\t\t\t\t\trecognizing only the objects of mathematics as of this nature. The first\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo kinds of substance come within the scope of physics, since they\n\t\t\t\t\tinvolve motion; the last belongs to some other science,\n\t\t\t\t\tif there is no principle common to all three.\n\t\t\t\t\tSensible substance is liable to change. Now if change proceeds from\n\t\t\t\t\topposites or intermediatesnot however from all opposites\n\t\t\t\t\t(for speech is not white), but only from the contrarythen there must be something underlying\n\t\t\t\t\twhich changes into the opposite contrary; for the contraries do not\n\t\t\t\t\tchange. Further, something persists, whereas the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary does not persist. Therefore besides the contraries there is\n\t\t\t\t\tsome third thing, the  . Now if change is of four\n\t\t\t\t\tkinds, in respect either of substance or of quality or of quantity or\n\t\t\t\t\tof place, and if change of substance is generation or destruction in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe simple sense, and change of quantity is increase or decrease, and\n\t\t\t\t\tchange of affection is alteration, and change of place is locomotion,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen changes must be in each case into the corresponding contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tstate.It must be the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter, then, which admits of both contraries, that changes. And since\n\t\t\t\t\t\"that which is\" is twofold, everything changes from that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially to that which is actually; e.g. from potentially white to\n\t\t\t\t\tactually white. The same applies to increase and decrease. Hence not\n\t\t\t\t\tonly may there be generation accidentally from that which is not, but\n\t\t\t\t\talso everything is generated from that which is,but is potentially and is not\n\t\t\t\t\tactually.And this is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe \"one\" of Anaxagoras; for his \"all things were together,\" and the \"mixture\"\n\t\t\t\t\tof Empedocles and Anaximander and the doctrine of Democritus would be\n\t\t\t\t\tbetter expressed as \"all things were together potentially, but not\n\t\t\t\t\tactually.\" Hence these thinkers must have had some\n\t\t\t\t\tconception of matter. All things which change have matter, but\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent things have different kinds; and of eternal things such as\n\t\t\t\t\tare not generable but are movable by locomotion have matter; matter,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, which admits not of generation, but of motion from one place\n\t\t\t\t\tto another.One\n\t\t\t\t\tmight raise the question from what sort of \"not-being\" generation\n\t\t\t\t\ttakes place; for not-being has three senses. If a thing exists through a potentiality,\n\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless it is not through a potentiality for any chance thing;\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent things are derived from different things.Nor is it satisfactory to say that \"all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings were together,\" for they differ in their matter, since\n\t\t\t\t\totherwise why did they become an infinity and not one? For Mind is\n\t\t\t\t\tone; so that if matter is also one, only that could have come to be in\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality whose matter existed potentially. The causes and principles,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, are three; two being the pair of contraries, of which one is the\n\t\t\t\t\tformula or form and the other the privation, and the third being the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter. We must next observe that\n\t\t\t\t\tneither matter nor form (I mean in the proximate sense) is generated.\n\t\t\t\t\tAll change is of some subject by some agent into some object.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe agent is the immediate mover; the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject is the matter; and the object is the form. Thus the process\n\t\t\t\t\twill go on to infinity if not only the bronze comes to be round, but\n\t\t\t\t\talso roundness or bronze comes to be; there must, then, be some\n\t\t\t\t\tstopping-point. We must next observe that every\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance is generated from something which has the same name\n\t\t\t\t\t(\"substances\" including not only natural but all other products).\n\t\t\t\t\tThings are generated either by art or by nature or by chance or\n\t\t\t\t\tspontaneously. Art is a generative principle in something else; nature\n\t\t\t\t\tis a generative principle in the subject itself(for man begets man); the other causes are privations of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese. There\n\t\t\t\t\tare three kinds of substance: (1.) matter, which exists individually\n\t\t\t\t\tin virtue of being apparent(for everything which is characterized\n\t\t\t\t\tby contact and so not by coalescence is matter and substrate; e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tfire, flesh and head;these\n\t\t\t\t\tare all matter, and the last is the matter of a substance in the\n\t\t\t\t\tstrictest sense); (2.) the \"nature\"(existing\n\t\t\t\t\tindividually)i.e. a kind of positive state which is the\n\t\t\t\t\tterminus of motion; and (3.) the particular combination of these, e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates or Callias. In\n\t\t\t\t\tsome cases the individuality does not exist apart from the composite\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance (e.g., the form of a house does not exist separately, except\n\t\t\t\t\tas the art of building;nor\n\t\t\t\t\tare these forms liable to generation and destruction; there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinct sense in which \"house\" and \"health\" and every artificial\n\t\t\t\t\tproduct, considered in the abstract, do or do not exist); if it does so at all, it does so\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of natural objects. Hence Plato was not far wrong in\n\t\t\t\t\tsaying that there are as many Forms as there are kinds\n\t\t\t\t\tof natural objects; that is if there are Forms distinct from the\n\t\t\t\t\tthings of our world. Moving causes are causes in the sense\n\t\t\t\t\tof pre-existent things, but formal causes coexist with their effects.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor it is when the man becomes healthy that health exists, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tshape of the bronze sphere comes into being simultaneously with the\n\t\t\t\t\tbronze sphere.Whether any\n\t\t\t\t\tform remains also afterwards is another question. In some cases there\n\t\t\t\t\tis nothing to prevent this, e.g. the soul may be of this nature (not\n\t\t\t\t\tall of it, but the intelligent part; for presumably all of it cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tbe). Clearly then there is no need on these grounds for the Ideas to\n\t\t\t\t\texist; for man begets man, the individual begetting the particular\n\t\t\t\t\tperson. And the same is true of the arts, for the art of medicine is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe formula of health. In one sense the causes and\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples are different for different things; but in another, if one\n\t\t\t\t\tspeaks generally and analogically, they are the same for all. For the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion might be raised whether the principles and elements of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances and of relations are the same or different; and similarly\n\t\t\t\t\twith respect to each of the other categories. But it is absurd that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey should be the same for all; for then relations and substance\n\t\t\t\t\twould have the same constituents.  What then can their common constituent\n\t\t\t\t\tbe? For there is nothing common to and yet distinct from substance and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other predicable categories, yet the element is prior to that of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it is an element. Moreover substance is not an element of\n\t\t\t\t\trelations, nor is any of the latter an element of substance. Further,\n\t\t\t\t\thow can all the categories have the same elements?For no element can be the same as that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is composed of elements; e.g., neither B nor A can be the same\n\t\t\t\t\tas BA (nor indeed can any of the \"intelligibles,\" e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity or Being, be an element; for these apply in every case, even to\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposite things); hence no element can be either substance or\n\t\t\t\t\trelation. But it must be one or the other. Therefore the categories\n\t\t\t\t\thave not all the same elements. The truth is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat, as we say, in one sense all things have the same elements and in\n\t\t\t\t\tanother they have not. E.g., the elements of sensible bodies are, let\n\t\t\t\t\tus say, (1) as form, the hot, and in another sense the cold, which is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe corresponding privation; as matter, that which directly and of its\n\t\t\t\t\town nature is potentially hot or cold. And not only these are\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances, but so are (2) the compounds of which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are principles, and (3) any unity which is generated from hot and\n\t\t\t\t\tcold, e.g. flesh or bone; for the product of hot and cold must be\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinct from them.These\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, then, have the same elements and principles, although\n\t\t\t\t\tspecifically different things have specifically different elements; we\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot, however, say that all things have the same elements in this\n\t\t\t\t\tsense, but only by analogy: i.e., one might say that there are three\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples, form, privation and matter.But each of these is different in respect of\n\t\t\t\t\teach class of things,e.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tin the case of color they are white, black, surface; or again there is\n\t\t\t\t\tlight, darkness and air, of which day and night are composed. And\n\t\t\t\t\tsince not only things which are inherent in an object are its causes,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut also certain external things, e.g. the moving cause, clearly\n\t\t\t\t\t\"principle\" and \"element\" are not the same; but both are causes.\n\t\t\t\t\tPrinciples are divided into these two kinds, and that which moves a\n\t\t\t\t\tthing or brings it to rest is a kind of principle and\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance.Thus\n\t\t\t\t\tanalogically there are three elements and four causes or principles;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut they are different in different cases, and the proximate moving\n\t\t\t\t\tcause is different in different cases. Health, disease, body; and the\n\t\t\t\t\tmoving cause is the art of medicine. Form, a particular kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tdisorder, bricks; and the moving cause is the art of\n\t\t\t\t\tbuilding.And since\n\t\t\t\t\tin the sphere of natural objects the moving cause of man is man, while\n\t\t\t\t\tin the sphere of objects of thought the moving cause is the form or\n\t\t\t\t\tits contrary, in one sense there are three causes and in another four.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor in a sense the art of medicine is health, and the art of building\n\t\t\t\t\tis the form of a house, and man begets man; but besides these there is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which as first of all things moves all things. Now\n\t\t\t\t\tsince some things can exist in separation and others cannot, it is the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer that are substances. And therefore all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings have the same causes, because without substance there can be no\n\t\t\t\t\taffections and motions. Next we shall see that these causes are\n\t\t\t\t\tprobably soul and body, or mind, appetite and body. Again, there is another sense in which by analogy\n\t\t\t\t\tthe principles are the same viz. actuality and potentiality; but these\n\t\t\t\t\tare different for different things, and apply to them in different\n\t\t\t\t\tways.For in some\n\t\t\t\t\tcases the same thing exists now actually and now potentially; e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\twine or flesh or man (actuality and potentiality also fall under the\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses as already described; for the form exists actually if it is\n\t\t\t\t\tseparable, and so does the compound of form and matter, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tprivation, e.g. darkness or disease; and the matter exists\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially, for it is this which has the potentiality of becoming\n\t\t\t\t\tboth;but the distinction in virtue of actuality and potentiality applies\n\t\t\t\t\tin a different sense to cases where the matter of cause and effect is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot the same, in some of which the form is not the same but different.\n\t\t\t\t\tE.g., the cause of a man is (i) his elements: fire and earth as\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter, and the particular form; (2) some external formal cause, viz.\n\t\t\t\t\this father; and besides these (3) the sun and the ecliptic, which are neither matter nor form nor privation nor\n\t\t\t\t\tidentical in form with him, but cause motion.Further, we must observe that some causes can be\n\t\t\t\t\tstated universally, but others cannot.The proximate principles of all things are the\n\t\t\t\t\tproximate actual individual and another individual which exists\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially.Therefore the proximate\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples are not universal. For it is the particular that is the\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple of particulars; \"man\" in general is the principle of \"man\"\n\t\t\t\t\tin general, but there is no such person as \"man,\" whereas Peleus is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe principle of Achilles and your father of you, and this particular\n\t\t\t\t\tB of this particular BA; but B in general is the principle of BA\n\t\t\t\t\tregarded absolutely.Again,\n\t\t\t\t\teven if the causes of substances are universal, still, as has been\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid, different things, i.e.\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which are not in the same genus, as colors, sounds, substances\n\t\t\t\t\tand quantity, have different causes and elements, except in an\n\t\t\t\t\tanalogical sense; and the causes of things which are in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tspecies are different, not in species, but because the causes of\n\t\t\t\t\tindividuals are different: your matter and form and moving cause being\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent from mine, although in their universal formula they are the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame. As for the question what are the principles\n\t\t\t\t\tor elements of substances and relations and qualities, whether they\n\t\t\t\t\tare the same or different, it is evident that when the terms\n\t\t\t\t\t\"principle\" and \"element\" are used with several meanings they are the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame for everything; but when the meanings are distinguished, they are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot the same but different; except that in a certain sense they are\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same for all. In a certain sense they are the same or analogous,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause (a) everything has matter, form, privation and a moving cause;\n\t\t\t\t\t(b) the causes of substances may be regarded as the causes of all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, since if substances are destroyed everything is destroyed; and\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther (c) that which is first in complete reality\n\t\t\t\t\tis the cause of all things.In another sense, however, proximate causes are different; there are\n\t\t\t\t\tas many proximate causes as there are contraries which are predicated\n\t\t\t\t\tneither as genera nor with a variety of meanings; and further the\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular material causes are different. Thus\n\t\t\t\t\twe have stated what the principles of sensible things are, and how\n\t\t\t\t\tmany they are, and in what sense they are the same and in what sense\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent. Since we have seen that there are three kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, two of which are natural and one immutable, we must now\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscuss the last named and show that there must be some substance\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is eternal and immutable. Substances are the primary reality,\n\t\t\t\t\tand if they are all perishable, everything is perishable. But motion\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot be either generated or destroyed, for it always existed; nor can time, because there\n\t\t\t\t\tcan be no priority or posteriority if there is no time. Hence as time is continuous,\n\t\t\t\t\tso too is motion; for time is either identical with motion or an\n\t\t\t\t\taffection of it. But there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinuous motion except that which is spatial, of spatial motion only\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is circular.But even if we\n\t\t\t\t\tare to suppose that there is something which is kinetic and productive\n\t\t\t\t\talthough it does not actually move or produce, there will not\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily be motion; for that which has a potentiality may not\n\t\t\t\t\tactualize it.Thus it will\n\t\t\t\t\tnot help matters if we posit eternal substances, as do the exponents\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Forms, unless there is in them some principle which can cause\n\t\t\t\t\tchange. And even this is not enough, nor is it\n\t\t\t\t\tenough if there is another substance besides the Forms; for unless it\n\t\t\t\t\tactually functions there will not be motion.And it will still not be enough even if it\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes function, if its essence is potentiality; for there will not be\n\t\t\t\t\teternal motion, since that which exists potentially may not\n\t\t\t\t\texist.Therefore there\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be a principle of this kind whose essence is actuality.\n\t\t\t\t\tFurthermore these substances must be\n\t\t\t\t\timmaterial; for they must be eternal if anything is. Therefore they\n\t\t\t\t\tare actuality. There is a difficulty, however; for it seems\n\t\t\t\t\tthat everything which actually functions has a potentiality, whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tnot everything which has a potentiality actually functions; so that\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality is prior. But if this is so, there need be no reality;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor everything may be capable of existing, but not yet\n\t\t\t\t\texistent.Yet if we\n\t\t\t\t\taccept the statements of the cosmologists who generate everything from\n\t\t\t\t\tNight, or the doctrine of the physicists that \"all\n\t\t\t\t\tthings were together,\" we have the same\n\t\t\t\t\timpossibility; for how can there be motion if there is no actual\n\t\t\t\t\tcause? Wood will not move itselfcarpentry must act upon it;\n\t\t\t\t\tnor will the menses or the earth move themselvesthe seeds\n\t\t\t\t\tmust act upon the earth, and the semen on the menses.Hence some, e.g. Leucippus\n\t\t\t\t\tand Plato, posit an\n\t\t\t\t\teternal actuality, for they say that there is always motion; but why\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is, and what it is, they do not say; nor, if it moves in this or\n\t\t\t\t\tthat particular way, what the cause is. For nothing is moved at\n\t\t\t\t\thaphazard, but in every case there must be some reason present; as in\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint of fact things are moved in one way by nature, and in another by\n\t\t\t\t\tforce or mind or some other agent. And further, what kind of motion is\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary? For this is an extremely important point.  Again,\n\t\t\t\t\tPlato at least cannot even explain what it is that he sometimes thinks\n\t\t\t\t\tto be the source of motion, i.e., that which moves itself; for\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to him the soul is posterior to motion and coeval with the\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible universe. Now to suppose that\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality is prior to actuality is in one sense right and in\n\t\t\t\t\tanother wrong; we have explained the\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinction.But that\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality is prior is testified by Anaxagoras (since mind is\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality), and by Empedocles with his theory of Love and Strife, and\n\t\t\t\t\tby those who hold that motion is eternal, e.g. Leucippus.Therefore Chaos or Night did not endure for\n\t\t\t\t\tan unlimited time, but the same things have always existed, either\n\t\t\t\t\tpassing through a cycle or in accordance with some other\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciplethat is, if actuality is prior to\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality.Now if\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is a regular cycle, there must be something which remains always active in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame way; but if there is to be generation and destruction, there must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe something else which is always active in two\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent ways. Therefore this must be active in one way\n\t\t\t\t\tindependently, and in the other in virtue of something else, i.e.\n\t\t\t\t\teither of some third active principle or of the first.It must, then, be in virtue of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first; for this is in turn the cause both of the third and of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsecond. Therefore the first is preferable, since it was the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tperpetual regular motion, and something else was the cause of variety;\n\t\t\t\t\tand obviously both together make up the cause of perpetual variety.\n\t\t\t\t\tNow this is just what actually characterizes motions; therefore why\n\t\t\t\t\tneed we seek any further principles? Since (a) this is\n\t\t\t\t\ta possible explanation, and (b) if it is not true, we shall have to\n\t\t\t\t\tregard everything as coming from \"Night\" and \"all things together\" and \"not-being,\"these difficulties may be considered to be solved.\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is something which is eternally moved with an unceasing motion,\n\t\t\t\t\tand that circular motion. This is evident not merely in theory, but in\n\t\t\t\t\tfact. Therefore the \"ultimate heaven\" must be eternal. Then there is\n\t\t\t\t\talso something which moves it.And since that which is moved while it moves\n\t\t\t\t\tis intermediate, there is something which moves without being moved;\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething eternal which is both substance and actuality.Now it moves in the following manner. The\n\t\t\t\t\tobject of desire and the object of thought move without being moved.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe primary objects of desire and thought are the same. For it is the\n\t\t\t\t\tapparent good that is the object of appetite, and the real good that\n\t\t\t\t\tis the object of the rational will. Desire is the result of opinion\n\t\t\t\t\trather than opinion that of desire; it is the act of thinking that is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe starting-point.Now\n\t\t\t\t\tthought is moved by the intelligible, and one of the series of\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries is essentially\n\t\t\t\t\tintelligible. In this series substance stands first, and of substance\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is simple and exists actually. (The one and the simple are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot the same; for one signifies a measure, whereas \"simple\" means that the subject itself\n\t\t\t\t\tis in a certain state.)But\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Good, and that which is in itself desirable, are also in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tseries; and that which is first in a class is\n\t\t\t\t\talways best or analogous to the best.That the final cause may apply to immovable things is shown by the\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinction of its meanings. For the final cause is not only \"the good\n\t\t\t\t\t,\" but also \"the good which is\n\t\t\t\t\t.\" In the latter sense it\n\t\t\t\t\tapplies to immovable things, although in the former it does not; and\n\t\t\t\t\tit causes motion as being an object of love, whereas all other things\n\t\t\t\t\tcause motion because they are themselves in motion.Now if a thing is moved, it can be\n\t\t\t\t\totherwise than it is. Therefore if the actuality of \"the heaven\" is\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary locomotion, then in so far as \"the heaven\" is moved, in this\n\t\t\t\t\trespect at least it is possible for it to be otherwise; i.e. in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect of place, even if not of substantiality. But since there is\n\t\t\t\t\tsomethingXwhich moves while being itself\n\t\t\t\t\tunmoved, existing actually, X cannot be otherwise in any\n\t\t\t\t\trespect.For the\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary kind of change is locomotion, and of locomotion circular\n\t\t\t\t\tlocomotion; and this is the motion which X induces. Thus X is necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\texistent; and  necessary it is good, and is\n\t\t\t\t\tin this sense a first principle. For the necessary has all\n\t\t\t\t\tthese meanings: that which is by constraint because it is contrary to\n\t\t\t\t\timpulse; and that without which excellence is impossible; and that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich cannot be otherwise, but is absolutely necessary.Such, then, is the first principle upon which\n\t\t\t\t\tdepend the sensible universe and the world of nature.And its life is like the best\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we temporarily enjoy. It must be in that state always (which for\n\t\t\t\t\tus is impossible), since its actuality is also pleasure.(And for this reason waking, sensation and\n\t\t\t\t\tthinking are most pleasant, and hopes and memories are pleasant\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause of them.) Now thinking in itself is concerned with that which\n\t\t\t\t\tis in itself best, and thinking in the highest sense with that which\n\t\t\t\t\tis in the highest sense best.And thought thinks itself through\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipation in the object of thought; for it becomes an object of\n\t\t\t\t\tthought by the act of apprehension and thinking, so that thought and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe object of thought are the same, because that which is receptive of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe object of thought, i.e. essence, is thought. And it actually\n\t\t\t\t\tfunctions when it possesses this object. Hence it is actuality\n\t\t\t\t\trather than potentiality that is held to be the divine possession of\n\t\t\t\t\trational thought, and its active contemplation is that which is most\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasant and best.If,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, the happiness which God always enjoys is as great as that which\n\t\t\t\t\twe enjoy sometimes, it is marvellous; and if it is greater, this is\n\t\t\t\t\tstill more marvellous. Nevertheless it is so. Moreover, life belongs\n\t\t\t\t\tto God. For the actuality of thought is life, and God is that\n\t\t\t\t\tactuality; and the essential actuality of God is life most good and\n\t\t\t\t\teternal. We hold, then, that God is a living being, eternal, most\n\t\t\t\t\tgood; and therefore life and a continuous eternal existence belong to\n\t\t\t\t\tGod; for that is what God is. Those who suppose, as do the\n\t\t\t\t\tPythagoreans and Speusippus, that\n\t\t\t\t\tperfect beauty and goodness donot exist\n\t\t\t\t\tin the beginning (on the ground that whereas the first beginnings of\n\t\t\t\t\tplants and animals are causes, it is in the products of these that\n\t\t\t\t\tbeauty and perfection are found) are mistaken in their\n\t\t\t\t\tviews.For seed\n\t\t\t\t\tcomes from prior creatures which are perfect, and that which is first\n\t\t\t\t\tis not the seed but the perfect creature. E.g.,\n\t\t\t\t\tone might say that prior to the seed is the mannot he who\n\t\t\t\t\tis produced from the seed, but another man from whom the seed\n\t\t\t\t\tcomes. Thus\n\t\t\t\t\tit is evident from the foregoing account that there is some substance\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is eternal and immovable and separate from sensible things; and\n\t\t\t\t\tit has also been shown that this substance can have no magnitude, but\n\t\t\t\t\tis impartible and indivisible (for it causes motion for infinite time,\n\t\t\t\t\tand nothing finite has an infinite potentiality; and therefore since\n\t\t\t\t\tevery magnitude is either finite or infinite, it cannot have finite\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnitude,and it\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot have infinite magnitude because there is no such thing at all);\n\t\t\t\t\tand moreover that it is impassive and unalterable; for all the other\n\t\t\t\t\tkinds of motion are posterior to spatial motion. Thus it is clear why\n\t\t\t\t\tthis substance has these attributes. We must not\n\t\t\t\t\tdisregard the question whether we should hold that there is one\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance of this kind or more than one, and if more than one, how\n\t\t\t\t\tmany; we must review the pronouncements of other thinkers and show\n\t\t\t\t\tthat with regard to the number of the substances they have said\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing that can be clearly stated.The theory of the Ideas contains no peculiar\n\t\t\t\t\ttreatment of the question; for the exponents of the theory call the\n\t\t\t\t\tIdeas numbers, and speak of the numbersnow as though they were unlimited and now as though\n\t\t\t\t\tthey were limited by the number 10; but as for why there should be just so many numbers,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is no explanation given with demonstrative accuracy.We, however, must discuss the\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion on the basis of the assumptions and distinctions which we\n\t\t\t\t\thave already made.The first principle\n\t\t\t\t\tand primary reality is immovable, both essentially and accidentally,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut it excites the primary form of motion, which is one and\n\t\t\t\t\teternal.Now since\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is moved must be moved by something, and the prime mover\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be essentially immovable, and eternal motion must be excited by\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething eternal, and one motion by some one thing; and since we can\n\t\t\t\t\tsee that besides the simple spatial motion of the universe(which we hold to be excited by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe primary immovable substance) there are other spatial\n\t\t\t\t\tmotionsthose of the planetswhich are eternal\n\t\t\t\t\t(because a body which moves in a circle is eternal and is never at\n\t\t\t\t\trestthis has been proved in our physical treatises); then each of these spatial motions must\n\t\t\t\t\talso be excited by a substance which is essentially immovable and\n\t\t\t\t\teternal.For the\n\t\t\t\t\tnature of the heavenly bodies is eternal, being a kind of substance;\n\t\t\t\t\tand that which moves is eternal and prior to the moved; and that which\n\t\t\t\t\tis prior to a substance must be a substance. It is therefore clear\n\t\t\t\t\tthat there must be an equal number of substances, in nature eternal,\n\t\t\t\t\tessentially immovable, and without magnitude; for the reason already\n\t\t\t\t\tstated.\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus it is clear that the movers are\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances, and that one of them is first and another second and so on\n\t\t\t\t\tin the same order as the spatial motions of the heavenly\n\t\t\t\t\tbodies.As regards\n\t\t\t\t\tthe number of these motions, we have now reached a question which must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe investigated by the aid of that branch of mathematical science\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is most akin to philosophy, i.e. astronomy; for this has as its\n\t\t\t\t\tobject a substance which is sensible but eternal, whereas the other\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical sciences, e.g. arithmetic and geometry, do not deal with\n\t\t\t\t\tany substance. That there are more spatial motions than there are\n\t\t\t\t\tbodies which move in space is obvious to those who have even a\n\t\t\t\t\tmoderate grasp of the subject, since each of the non-fixed stars has\n\t\t\t\t\tmore than one spatial motion.As to how many these spatial motions actually\n\t\t\t\t\tare we shall now, to give some idea of the subject, quote what some of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe mathematicians say, in order that there may be some definite\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber for the mind to grasp; but for the rest we must partly\n\t\t\t\t\tinvestigate for ourselves and partly learn from other investigators,\n\t\t\t\t\tand if those who apply themselves to these matters come to some\n\t\t\t\t\tconclusion which clashes with what we have just stated, we must\n\t\t\t\t\tappreciate both views, but follow the more accurate.\n\t\t\t\t\tEudoxus held\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the motion of the sun and moon involves in either case three\n\t\t\t\t\tspheres, of which\n\t\t\t\t\tthe outermost is that of the fixed stars, the second revolves in the circle\n\t\t\t\t\twhich bisects the zodiac, and the third revolves in a\n\t\t\t\t\tcircle which is inclined across the breadth of the zodiac; but the circle in which the moon moves is inclined at\n\t\t\t\t\ta greater angle than that in which the sun moves.And he held that the motion of the\n\t\t\t\t\tplanets involved in each case four spheres; and that of these the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst and second are the same as before (for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sphere of the fixed stars is that which carries round all the\n\t\t\t\t\tother spheres, and the sphere next in order, which has its motion in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe circle which bisects the zodiac, is common to all the planets);\n\t\t\t\t\tthe third sphere of all the planets has its poles in the circle which\n\t\t\t\t\tbisects the zodiac; and the fourth sphere moves in the circle inclined\n\t\t\t\t\tto the equator of the third. In the case of the third sphere, while\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other planets have their own peculiar poles, those of Venus and\n\t\t\t\t\tMercury are the same. Callippus assumed the same arrangement of the\n\t\t\t\t\tspheres as did Eudoxus (that is, with respect to the order of their\n\t\t\t\t\tintervals), but as regards their number, whereas he assigned to\n\t\t\t\t\tJupiter and Saturn the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame number of spheres as Eudoxus, he considered that two further\n\t\t\t\t\tspheres should be added both for the sun and for the moon, if the\n\t\t\t\t\tphenomena are to be accounted for, and one for each of the other\n\t\t\t\t\tplanets. But if all the spheres in combination\n\t\t\t\t\tare to account for the phenomena, there must be for\n\t\t\t\t\teach of the other planets other spheres, one less in number than those\n\t\t\t\t\talready mentioned, which counteract these and restore to the same\n\t\t\t\t\tposition the first sphere of the star which in each case is next in\n\t\t\t\t\torder below. In this way\n\t\t\t\t\tonly can the combination of forces produce the motion of the\n\t\t\t\t\tplanets.Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tsince the forces by which the planets themselves are moved are 8 for\n\t\t\t\t\tJupiter and Saturn, and 25 for the others, and since of these the only\n\t\t\t\t\tones which do not need to be counteracted are those by which the\n\t\t\t\t\tlowest planet\n\t\t\t\t\tis moved, the counteracting spheres for the first two planets will be\n\t\t\t\t\t6, and those of the remaining four will be 16; and the total number of\n\t\t\t\t\tspheres, both those which move the planets and those which counteract\n\t\t\t\t\tthese, will be 55.If we\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not invest the moon and the sun with the additional motions which\n\t\t\t\t\twe have mentioned, there will be 47 (?) spheres\n\t\t\t\t\tin all.This, then, may be taken to be\n\t\t\t\t\tthe number of the spheres; and thus it is reasonable to suppose that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are as many immovable substances and principles,the statement of logical necessity may\n\t\t\t\t\tbe left to more competent thinkers. If there can be\n\t\t\t\t\tno spatial motion which is not conducive to the motion of a\n\t\t\t\t\tstar,and if moreover\n\t\t\t\t\tevery entity and every substance which is impassive and has in itself\n\t\t\t\t\tattained to the highest good should be regarded as an end, then there\n\t\t\t\t\tcan be no other entity besides these, and the number of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances must be as we have said. For if there are other substances,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey must move something, since they are the end of spatial\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion.But there\n\t\t\t\t\tcan be no other spatial motions besides those already mentioned. This\n\t\t\t\t\tis a reasonable inference from a general consideration of spatial\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion. For if everything which moves exists for the sake of that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is moved, and every motion for the sake of something which is\n\t\t\t\t\tmoved, no motion can exist for the sake of itself or of some other\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion, but all motions must exist for the sake of the\n\t\t\t\t\tstars.For if we are\n\t\t\t\t\tto suppose that one motion is for the sake of another, the latter too\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be for the sake of something else; and since the series cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\tinfinite, the end of every motion must be one of the divine bodies\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are moved through the heavens.It\n\t\t\t\t\tis evident that there is only one heaven. For if there is to be a\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality of heavens (as there is of men), the principle of each must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe one in kind but many in number.But all things which are many in number have\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter (for one and the same definition applies to many individuals,\n\t\t\t\t\te.g. that of \"man\"; but\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates is one), but the primary\n\t\t\t\t\tessence has no matter, because it is complete reality. Therefore the\n\t\t\t\t\tprime mover, which is immovable, is one both in formula and in number;\n\t\t\t\t\tand therefore so also is that which is eternally and continuously in\n\t\t\t\t\tmotion. Therefore there is only one heaven.  A tradition has been handed down by the\n\t\t\t\t\tancient thinkers of very early times, and bequeathed to posterity in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe form of a myth, to the effect that these heavenly bodies are\n\t\t\t\t\tgods, and that the Divine pervades the whole of\n\t\t\t\t\tnature.The rest of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir tradition has been added later in a mythological form to\n\t\t\t\t\tinfluence the vulgar and as a constitutional and utilitarian\n\t\t\t\t\texpedient; they say that these\n\t\t\t\t\tgods are human in shape or are like certain other animals, and\n\t\t\t\t\tmake other statements consequent upon and similar to those which we\n\t\t\t\t\thave mentioned.Now if we\n\t\t\t\t\tseparate these statements and accept only the first, that they\n\t\t\t\t\tsupposed the primary substances to be gods, we must regard it as an\n\t\t\t\t\tinspired saying and reflect that whereas every art and philosophy has\n\t\t\t\t\tprobably been repeatedly developed to the utmost and has perished\n\t\t\t\t\tagain, these beliefs of theirs have been preserved as a relic of\n\t\t\t\t\tformer knowledge. To this extent only, then, are the views of our\n\t\t\t\t\tforefathers and of the earliest thinkers intelligible to us.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe subject of Mind involves certain difficulties. Mind is held to be\n\t\t\t\t\tof all phenomena the most supernatural; but the question of how we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust regard it if it is to be of this nature involves certain\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties. If Mind thinks nothing, where is its dignity? It is in\n\t\t\t\t\tjust the same state as a man who is asleep. If it thinks, but\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else determines its thinking, then since that which is its\n\t\t\t\t\tessence is not thinking but potentiality,it\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot be the best reality; because it derives its excellence from the\n\t\t\t\t\tact of thinking.Again,\n\t\t\t\t\twhether its essence is thought or thinking, what does it think? It\n\t\t\t\t\tmust think either itself or something else; and if something else,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen it must think either the same thing always, or different things\n\t\t\t\t\tat different times. Then does it make any difference, or not, whether\n\t\t\t\t\tit thinks that which is good or thinks at random?Surely it would be absurd for it to\n\t\t\t\t\tthink about some subjects. Clearly, then, it thinks that which is most\n\t\t\t\t\tdivine and estimable, and does not change; for the change would be for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe worse, and anything of this kind would immediately imply some sort\n\t\t\t\t\tof motion. Therefore if Mind is not thinking but a potentiality, (a)\n\t\t\t\t\tit is reasonable to suppose that the continuity of its thinking is\n\t\t\t\t\tlaborious; (b) clearly there\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be something else which is more excellent than Mind; i.e. the\n\t\t\t\t\tobject of thought;for both\n\t\t\t\t\tthought and the act of thinking will belong even to the thinker of the\n\t\t\t\t\tworst thoughts. Therefore if this is to be\n\t\t\t\t\tavoided (as it is, since it is better not to see some things than to\n\t\t\t\t\tsee them), thinking cannot be the supreme good. Therefore Mind thinks\n\t\t\t\t\titself, if it is that which is best; and its thinking is a thinking of\n\t\t\t\t\tthinking.Yet it seems that\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge and perception and opinion and understanding are always of\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else, and only incidentally of themselves.And further, if to think is not the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame as to be thought, in respect of which does goodness belong to\n\t\t\t\t\tthought? for the act of thinking and the object of thought have not\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same essence. The answer is that in some cases\n\t\t\t\t\tthe knowledge is the object. In the productive sciences, if we\n\t\t\t\t\tdisregard the matter, the substance, i.e. the essence, is the object;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut in the speculative sciences the formula or the act of thinking is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe object. Therefore since thought and the object of thought are not\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent in the case of things which contain no matter, they will be\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same, and the act of thinking will be one with the object of\n\t\t\t\t\tthought. There still remains the question whether the\n\t\t\t\t\tobject of thought is composite; for if so, thought would change in\n\t\t\t\t\tpassing from one part of the whole to another. The answer is that\n\t\t\t\t\teverything which contains no matter is indivisible. Just as the human\n\t\t\t\t\tmind, or rather the mind of composite beings, is in a certain space of time(for\n\t\t\t\t\tit does not possess the good at this or at that moment, but in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcourse of a certain whole period it attains to the supreme good, which\n\t\t\t\t\tis other than itself), so is absolute self-thought throughout all\n\t\t\t\t\teternity. We must also consider in which sense\n\t\t\t\t\tthe nature of the universe contains the good or the supreme good;\n\t\t\t\t\twhether as something separate and independent, or as the orderly\n\t\t\t\t\tarrangement of its parts.Probably in both senses, as an army does; for the efficiency of an\n\t\t\t\t\tarmy consists partly in the order and partly in the general; but\n\t\t\t\t\tchiefly in the latter, because he does not depend upon the order, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe order depends upon him. All things, both fishes and birds and\n\t\t\t\t\tplants, are ordered together in some way, but not in the same way; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe system is not such that there is no relation between one thing and\n\t\t\t\t\tanother; there is a definite connection.Everything is ordered together to one end; but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe arrangement is like that in a household, where the free persons\n\t\t\t\t\thave the least liberty to act at random,and have all or most of their actions preordained\n\t\t\t\t\tfor them, whereas the slaves and animals have little common\n\t\t\t\t\tresponsibility and act for the most part at random; for the nature of\n\t\t\t\t\teach class is a principle such as we have described. I mean, for example, that\n\t\t\t\t\teverything must at least come to dissolution; and similarly there are\n\t\t\t\t\tother respects in which everything contributes to the good of the\n\t\t\t\t\twhole.We must not fail to observe\n\t\t\t\t\thow many impossibilities and absurdities are involved by other\n\t\t\t\t\ttheories, and what views the more enlightened thinkers hold, and what\n\t\t\t\t\tviews entail the fewest difficulties.All thinkers maintain that all things come\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom contraries; but they are wrong both in saying \"all things\" and in saying that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey come from contraries, nor do they\n\t\t\t\t\texplain how things in which the contraries really are present come\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the contraries; for the contraries cannot act upon each other.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor us, however, this problem is satisfactorily solved by the fact\n\t\t\t\t\tthat there is a third factor. Other thinkers make one of the two\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries matter; e.g., this is done by those who make the Unequal matter for the Equal, or\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Many matter for the One.But this also is disposed of in the same way;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the one matter of two contraries is contrary to nothing. Further,\n\t\t\t\t\ton their view everything except Unity itself will partake of evil; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\"the Bad\" is itself one of the elements. The\n\t\t\t\t\tother school does not even regard\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Good and the Bad as principles; yet the Good is in the truest\n\t\t\t\t\tsense a principle in all things. The former school is right in holding\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the Good is a principle, but they do not explain how it is a\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple whether as an end or as a moving\n\t\t\t\t\tcause or as form. Empedocles theory is also absurd, for\n\t\t\t\t\the identifies the Good with Love. This is a principle both as causing motion (since\n\t\t\t\t\tit combines) and as matter (since it is part of the mixture). Now even\n\t\t\t\t\tif it so happens that the same thing is a principle both as matter and\n\t\t\t\t\tas causing motion, still the essence of the two principles is not the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame. In which respect, then, is Love a principle? And it is also\n\t\t\t\t\tabsurd that Strife should be imperishable; strife is the very essence\n\t\t\t\t\tof evil.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnaxagoras makes the Good a principle as causing motion; for Mind\n\t\t\t\t\tmoves things, but moves them for some end, and therefore there must be\n\t\t\t\t\tsome other Goodunless it is as we say; for on our view\n\t\t\t\t\tthe art of medicine is in a sense health. It is absurd also not to provide a contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the Good, i.e. for Mind.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut all those who recognize the contraries fail to make use of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries, unless we systematize their theories.And none of them explains why some\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are perishable and others imperishable; for they make all\n\t\t\t\t\texisting things come from the same first principles. Again, some make existing things come from\n\t\t\t\t\tnot-being, while others,\n\t\t\t\t\tto avoid this necessity, make all things one. Again, no one explains\n\t\t\t\t\twhy there must always be generation, and what the cause of generation\n\t\t\t\t\tis. Moreover, those who posit two principles must\n\t\t\t\t\tadmit another superior principle, and so must the\n\t\t\t\t\texponents of the Forms; for what made or makes particulars participate\n\t\t\t\t\tin the Forms?And on all\n\t\t\t\t\tother views it follows necessarily that there must be something which\n\t\t\t\t\tis contrary to Wisdom or supreme knowledge, but on ours it does not.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor there is no contrary to that which is primary,since all contraries involve matter,\n\t\t\t\t\tand that which has matter exists potentially; and the ignorance which\n\t\t\t\t\tis contrary to Wisdom would tend towards the contrary of the object of\n\t\t\t\t\tWisdom; but that which is primary has no contrary.Further, if there is to be nothing else besides\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible things, there will be no first principle, no order, no\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration, and no celestial motions, but every principle will be\n\t\t\t\t\tbased upon another, as in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe accounts of all the cosmologists and physicists.And if the Forms or numbers\n\t\t\t\t\tare to exist, they will be causes of nothing; or if not of nothing, at\n\t\t\t\t\tleast not of motion.Further, how can\n\t\t\t\t\textension, i.e. a continuum, be produced from that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tunextended? Number cannot, either as a moving or as a formal cause,\n\t\t\t\t\tproduce a continuum. Moreover, no contrary can be essentially\n\t\t\t\t\tproductive and kinetic, for then it would be possible for it not to\n\t\t\t\t\texist;and further,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe act of production would in any case be posterior to the\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality. Therefore the world of reality is not eternal. But there\n\t\t\t\t\tare real objects which are eternal. Therefore one of these premisses\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be rejected. We have described how this may be done.Further, in\n\t\t\t\t\tvirtue of what the numbers, or soul and body, or in general the form\n\t\t\t\t\tand the object, are one, no one attempts to explain; nor is it\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible to do so except on our theory, that it is the moving cause\n\t\t\t\t\tthat makes them one.\n\t\t\t\t\tAs for those who maintain\n\t\t\t\t\tthat mathematical number is the primary reality, and so\n\t\t\t\t\tgo on generating one substance after another and finding different\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples for each one, they make the substance of the universe\n\t\t\t\t\tincoherent (for one substance in no way affects another by its\n\t\t\t\t\texistence or non-existence) and give us a great many governing\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples. But the world must not be governed badly:The rule of many is not good; let one be the\n\t\t\t\t\truler."}}, {"@n": "13", "@type": "Book", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1076a", "@unit": "section"},

For\n\t\t\t\t\twe must be content if we state some points better than they have done,\n\t\t\t\t\tand others no worse. There are two views on this subject.\n\t\t\t\t\tSome say that mathematical objects, i.e. numbers and lines, are\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances; and others again that the Ideas are substances.Now since some\n\t\t\t\t\trecognize these as two classesthe Ideas and the mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbersand others regard both as having one\n\t\t\t\t\tnature, and yet others hold that only the\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical substances are substances, we must first consider the\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical objects, without imputing to them any other\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristice.g. by asking whether they are really Ideas\n\t\t\t\t\tor not, or whether they are principles and substances of existing\n\t\t\t\t\tthings or notand merely inquire whether as mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects they exist or not, and if they do, in what sense; then after\n\t\t\t\t\tthis we must separately consider the Ideas themselves, simply and in\n\t\t\t\t\tso far as the accepted procedure requires; for most of the arguments\n\t\t\t\t\thave been made familiar already by the criticisms of other\n\t\t\t\t\tthinkers.And\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther, the greater part of our discussion must bear directly upon\n\t\t\t\t\tthis second questionviz. when we are considering whether\n\t\t\t\t\tthe substances and first principles of existing things are numbers and\n\t\t\t\t\tIdeas; for after we have dealt with the Ideas there remains this third\n\t\t\t\t\tquestion. Now if the objects of mathematics\n\t\t\t\t\texist, they must be either in sensible things, as some hold; or\n\t\t\t\t\tseparate from them (there are some also who hold this view); or if\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are neither the one nor the other, either they do not exist at\n\t\t\t\t\tall, or they exist in some other way. Thus the point which we shall\n\t\t\t\t\thave to discuss is concerned not with their existence, but with the\n\t\t\t\t\tmode of their existence. That the objects of\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematics cannot be in sensible things, and that moreover the theory\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they are is a fabrication, has been observed already in our\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscussion of difficulties\n\t\t\t\t\tthe reasons being (a) that two solids\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot occupy the same space, and (b) that on this same theory all\n\t\t\t\t\tother potentialities and characteristics would exist in sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, and none of them would exist separately. This, then, has been\n\t\t\t\t\talready stated;but in\n\t\t\t\t\taddition to this it is clearly impossible on this theory for any body\n\t\t\t\t\tto be divided. For it must be divided in a plane, and the plane in a\n\t\t\t\t\tline, and the line at a point; and therefore if the point is\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible, so is the line, and so on.For what difference does it make whether\n\t\t\t\t\tentities of this kind are sensible objects, or while not being the\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects themselves, are yet present in them? the consequence will be\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same, for either they must be divided when the sensible objects\n\t\t\t\t\tare divided, or else not even the sensible objects can be\n\t\t\t\t\tdivided.Nor again can entities of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis kind exist separately.For if besides sensible solids there are to be other solids which\n\t\t\t\t\tare separate from them and prior to sensible solids, clearly besides\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible planes there must be other separate planes, and so too with\n\t\t\t\t\tpoints and lines; for the same argument applies. And if these exist,\n\t\t\t\t\tagain besides the planes, lines and points of the mathematical solid,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere must be others which are separate;for the incomposite is prior to the composite,\n\t\t\t\t\tand if prior to sensible bodies there are other non-sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tbodies,then by the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame argument the planes which exist independently must be prior to\n\t\t\t\t\tthose which are present in the immovable solids. Therefore there will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe planes and lines distinct from those which coexist with the\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately-existent solids; for the latter coexist with the\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical solids, but the former are prior to the mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tsolids.Again, in\n\t\t\t\t\tthese planes there will be lines, and by the same argument there must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe other lines prior to these; and prior to the points which are in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe prior lines there must be other points, although there will be no\n\t\t\t\t\tother points prior to these.Now the accumulation becomes absurd; because whereas we get only one\n\t\t\t\t\tclass of solids besides sensible solids, we get three classes of\n\t\t\t\t\tplanes besides sensible planesthose which exist separately\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom sensible planes, those which exist in the mathematical solids,\n\t\t\t\t\tand those which exist separately from those in the mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tsolidsfour classes of lines, and five of points;with which of these, then, will\n\t\t\t\t\tthe mathematical sciences deal? Not, surely, with the planes, lines\n\t\t\t\t\tand points in the immovable solid; for knowledge is always concerned\n\t\t\t\t\twith that which is prior. And the same argument applies to numbers;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor there will be other units besides each class of points, and\n\t\t\t\t\tbesides each class of existing things, first the sensible and then the\n\t\t\t\t\tintelligible; so that there will be an infinite number of kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical numbers. Again, there are the problems which we\n\t\t\t\t\tenumerated in our discussion of difficulties: how can they be solved? For\n\t\t\t\t\tthe objects of astronomy will similarly be distinct from sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, and so will those of geometry; but how can a heaven and its\n\t\t\t\t\tparts (or anything else which has motion) exist apart from the\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible heaven? And similarly the objects of optics and of harmonics\n\t\t\t\t\twill be distinct, for there will be sound and sight apart from the\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible and particular objects.Hence clearly the other senses and objects of\n\t\t\t\t\tsense will exist separately; for why should one class of objects do so\n\t\t\t\t\trather than another? And if this is so, animals too will exist\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately, inasmuch as the senses will.Again, there are certain general mathematical theorems which are not\n\t\t\t\t\trestricted to these substances.Here, then, we shall have yet another kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance intermediate between and distinct from the Ideas and the\n\t\t\t\t\tintermediates, which is neither number nor points nor spatial\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnitude nor time. And if this is impossible, clearly it is also\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible that the aforesaid substances should exist separately from\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible objects. In general, consequences result which\n\t\t\t\t\tare contrary both to the truth and to received opinion if we thus\n\t\t\t\t\tposit the objects of mathematics as definite separately-existent\n\t\t\t\t\tentities. For if they exist in this way, they must be prior to\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible spatial magnitudes, whereas in truth they must be posterior\n\t\t\t\t\tto them; for the incomplete spatial magnitude is in point of\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration prior, but in point of substantiality posterior,as the inanimate is to the\n\t\t\t\t\tanimate. Again, in virtue of what can we\n\t\t\t\t\tpossibly regard mathematical magnitudes as one? Things in this world\n\t\t\t\t\tof ours may be reasonably supposed to be one in virtue of soul or part\n\t\t\t\t\tof the soul, or some other influence; apart from this they are a\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality and are disintegrated. But inasmuch as the former are\n\t\t\t\t\tdivisible and quantitative, what is the cause of their unity and\n\t\t\t\t\tcohesion?Again, the ways in which\n\t\t\t\t\tthe objects of mathematics are generated prove our point;for they are generated first\n\t\t\t\t\tin the dimension of length, then in that of breadth, and finally in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of depth, whereupon the process is complete. Thus if that which\n\t\t\t\t\tis posterior in generation is prior in substantiality, body will be prior\n\t\t\t\t\tto plane and line, and in this sense it will also be more truly\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete and whole, because it can become animate; whereas how could a\n\t\t\t\t\tline or plane be animate? The supposition is beyond our powers of\n\t\t\t\t\tapprehension. Further, body is a kind of substance,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince it already in some sense possesses completeness; but in what\n\t\t\t\t\tsense are lines substances? Neither as being a kind of form or shape,\n\t\t\t\t\tas perhaps the soul is, nor as being matter, like the body; for it\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not appear that anything can be composed either of lines or of\n\t\t\t\t\tplanes or of points,whereas if they were a kind of material substance it would be\n\t\t\t\t\tapparent that things can be so composed. Let it\n\t\t\t\t\tbe granted that they are prior in formula; yet not everything which is\n\t\t\t\t\tprior in formula is also prior in substantiality. Things are prior in\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstantiality which when separated have a superior power of\n\t\t\t\t\texistence; things are prior in formula from whose formulae the\n\t\t\t\t\tformulae of other things are compounded. And these characteristics are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot indissociable.For if\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes, such as \"moving\" or \"white,\" do not exist apart from their\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances, \"white\" will be prior in formula to \"white man,\" but not\n\t\t\t\t\tin substantiality; for it cannot exist in separation, but always\n\t\t\t\t\texists conjointly with the concrete wholeby which I mean\n\t\t\t\t\t\"white man.\"Thus it is\n\t\t\t\t\tobvious that neither is the result of abstraction prior, nor the\n\t\t\t\t\tresult of adding a determinant posteriorfor the expression\n\t\t\t\t\t\"white man\" is the result of adding a determinant to\n\t\t\t\t\t\"white.\"Thus we have sufficiently\n\t\t\t\t\tshown (a) that the objects of mathematics are not more substantial\n\t\t\t\t\tthan corporeal objects; (b) that they are not prior in point of\n\t\t\t\t\texistence to sensible things, but only in formula; and (c) that they\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot in any way exist in separation.And since we have seen that they cannot exist in\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible things, it is clear that either they do not exist at all, or\n\t\t\t\t\tthey exist only in a certain way, and therefore not absolutely; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\"exist\" has several senses. The general propositions in\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematics are not concerned with objects which exist separately\n\t\t\t\t\tapart from magnitudes and numbers; they are concerned with magnitudes\n\t\t\t\t\tand numbers,but not with\n\t\t\t\t\tthem as possessing magnitude or being divisible. It is clearly\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible that in the same way propositions and logical proofs may\n\t\t\t\t\tapply to sensible magnitudes; not  sensible,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut  having certain\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristics.For\n\t\t\t\t\tjust as there can be many propositions about things merely  movable, without any reference to the\n\t\t\t\t\tessential nature of each one or to their attributes, and it does not\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily follow from this either that there is something movable\n\t\t\t\t\twhich exists in separation from sensible things or that there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinct movable nature in sensible things; so too there will be\n\t\t\t\t\tpropositions and sciences which apply to movable things, not  movable but \n\t\t\t\t\tcorporeal only; and again  planes only and\n\t\t\t\t\t lines only, and  divisible, and  indivisible but\n\t\t\t\t\thaving position, and  indivisible\n\t\t\t\t\tonly.Therefore since\n\t\t\t\t\tit is true to say in a general sense not only that things which are\n\t\t\t\t\tseparable but that things which are inseparable exist, e.g., that\n\t\t\t\t\tmovable things exist, it is also true to say in a general sense that\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical objects exist, and in such a form as mathematicians\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribe them.And just as\n\t\t\t\t\tit is true to say generally of the other sciences that they deal with\n\t\t\t\t\ta particular subjectnot with that which is accidental to it\n\t\t\t\t\t(e.g. not with \"white\" if \"the healthy\" is white, and the subject of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe science is \"the healthy\"), but with that which is the subject of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe particular science; with the healthy if\n\t\t\t\t\tit treats of things  healthy, and with man\n\t\t\t\t\tif  manso this is also true of\n\t\t\t\t\tgeometry. If the things of which it treats are accidentally sensible\n\t\t\t\t\talthough it does not treat of them \n\t\t\t\t\tsensible, it does not follow that the mathematical sciences treat of\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible thingsnor, on the other hand, that they treat of\n\t\t\t\t\tother things which exist independently apart from these.\n\t\t\t\t\tMany attributes are essential properties of things as possessing a\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular characteristic; e.g., there are attributes peculiar to an\n\t\t\t\t\tanimal  female or \n\t\t\t\t\tmale, although there is no such thing as female or male in separation\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom animals. Hence there are also attributes which are peculiar to\n\t\t\t\t\tthings merely  lines or planes.And in proportion as the things\n\t\t\t\t\twhich we are considering are prior in formula and simpler, they admit\n\t\t\t\t\tof greater exactness; for simplicity implies exactness. Hence we find\n\t\t\t\t\tgreater exactness where there is no magnitude, and the greatest\n\t\t\t\t\texactness where there is no motion; or if motion is involved, where it\n\t\t\t\t\tis primary, because this is the simplest kind; and the simplest kind\n\t\t\t\t\tof primary motion is uniform motion. The same principle applies to\n\t\t\t\t\tboth harmonics and optics, for neither of these sciences studies\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects  sight or \n\t\t\t\t\tsound, but  lines and numbers; yet the latter are affections peculiar to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe former. The same is also true of mechanics. Thus\n\t\t\t\t\tif we regard objects independently of their attributes and investigate\n\t\t\t\t\tany aspect of them as so regarded, we shall not be guilty of any error\n\t\t\t\t\ton this account, any more than when we draw a diagram on the ground\n\t\t\t\t\tand say that a line is a foot long when it is not;because the error is not in the\n\t\t\t\t\tpremisses. The best way to\n\t\t\t\t\tconduct an investigation in every case is to take that which does not\n\t\t\t\t\texist in separation and consider it separately; which is just what the\n\t\t\t\t\tarithmetician or the geometrician does.For man,  man, is\n\t\t\t\t\tone indivisible thing; and the arithmetician assumes man to be one\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible thing, and then considers whether there is any attribute\n\t\t\t\t\tof man  indivisible. And the geometrician\n\t\t\t\t\tconsiders man neither  man nor  indivisible, but  something solid. For clearly the attributes which would have\n\t\t\t\t\tbelonged to \"man\" even if man were somehow not indivisible can belong\n\t\t\t\t\tto man irrespectively of his humanity or indivisibility.Hence for this reason the\n\t\t\t\t\tgeometricians are right in what they maintain, and treat of what\n\t\t\t\t\treally exists; i.e., the objects of geometry really exist. For things\n\t\t\t\t\tcan exist in two ways, either in complete reality or as matter.And since\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness is distinct from beauty (for it is always in actions that\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness is present, whereas beauty is also in immovable things),\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are in error who\n\t\t\t\t\tassert that the mathematical sciences tell us nothing about beauty or\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness;for they\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribe and manifest these qualities in the highest degree, since it\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes not follow, because they manifest the effects and principles of\n\t\t\t\t\tbeauty and goodness without naming them, that they do not treat of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese qualities. The main species of beauty are orderly arrangement,\n\t\t\t\t\tproportion, and definiteness; and these are\n\t\t\t\t\tespecially manifested by the mathematical sciences.And inasmuch as it is evident that\n\t\t\t\t\tthese (I mean, e.g., orderly arrangement and definiteness) are causes\n\t\t\t\t\tof many things, obviously they must also to some extent treat of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause in this sense, i.e. the cause in the sense of the Beautiful. But\n\t\t\t\t\twe shall deal with this subject more explicitly elsewhere. As regards the objects of\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematics, then, the foregoing account may be taken as sufficient to\n\t\t\t\t\tshow that they exist, and in what sense they exist, and in what sense\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are prior and in what they are not. But as regards the Ideas we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust first consider the actual theory in relation to the Idea, without\n\t\t\t\t\tconnecting it in any way with the nature of numbers, but approaching\n\t\t\t\t\tit in the form in which it was originally propounded by the first\n\t\t\t\t\texponents of the Ideas. The\n\t\t\t\t\ttheory of Forms occurred to those who enunciated it because they were\n\t\t\t\t\tconvinced as to the true nature of reality by the doctrine of\n\t\t\t\t\tHeraclitus, that all sensible things are always in a state of flux; so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat if there is to be any knowledge or thought about anything, there\n\t\t\t\t\tmust be certain other entities, besides sensible ones, which persist.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor there can be no knowledge of that which is in flux.Now\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates devoted his attention to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe moral virtues, and was the first to seek a general definition of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese(for of the\n\t\t\t\t\tPhysicists Democritus gained only a superficial grasp of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject\n\t\t\t\t\tand defined, after a fashion, \"the hot\" and \"the cold\"; while the\n\t\t\t\t\tPythagoreans at an earlier\n\t\t\t\t\tdate had arrived at definitions of some few thingswhose\n\t\t\t\t\tformulae they connected with numberse.g., what\n\t\t\t\t\t\"opportunity\" is, or \"justice\" or \"marriage\"); and he naturally\n\t\t\t\t\tinquired into the essence of things;for he was trying to reason logically, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tstarting-point of all logical reasoning is the essence. At that time\n\t\t\t\t\tthere was as yet no such proficiency in Dialectic that men could study\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries independently of the essence, and consider whether both\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries come under the same science.There are two innovations\n\t\t\t\t\twhich, may fairly be ascribed to\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates: inductive reasoning and general definition.\n\t\t\t\t\tBoth of these are associated with the starting-point of scientific\n\t\t\t\t\tknowledge.But whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates regarded neither\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversals nor definitions as existing in separation, the Idealists\n\t\t\t\t\tgave them a separate existence, and to these universals and\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinitions of existing things they gave the name of Ideas.\n\t\t\t\t\tHence on their view it followed by virtually the same argument that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are Ideas of all terms which are predicated universally; and the result was very\n\t\t\t\t\tnearly the same as if a man who wishes to count a number of things\n\t\t\t\t\twere to suppose that he could not do so when they are few, and yet\n\t\t\t\t\twere to try to count them when he has added to them. For it is hardly\n\t\t\t\t\tan exaggeration to say that there are more Forms than there are\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular sensible things (in seeking for\n\t\t\t\t\twhose causes these thinkers were led on from particulars to Ideas);\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause corresponding to each thing there is a synonymous entity,\n\t\t\t\t\tapart from the substances (and in the case of non-substantial things\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is a One over the Many) both in our everyday world and in the\n\t\t\t\t\trealm of eternal entities. Again, not one of the ways in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich it is attempted to prove that the Forms exist demonstrates their\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint; from some of them no necessary conclusion follows, and from\n\t\t\t\t\tothers it follows that there are Form of things of which they hold\n\t\t\t\t\tthat there are no Forms.For according to the arguments from the sciences, there will be\n\t\t\t\t\tForms of all things of which there are sciences; and according to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\"One-over-Many\" argument, of negations too; and according to the\n\t\t\t\t\targument that \"we have some conception of what has perished\" there\n\t\t\t\t\twill be Forms of perishable things, because we have a mental picture\n\t\t\t\t\tof these things. Further, of the most exact arguments some establish\n\t\t\t\t\tIdeas of relations, of which the Idealists deny that there is a\n\t\t\t\t\tseparate genus, and others state the \"Third Man.\"And in general the arguments for the\n\t\t\t\t\tForms do away with things which are more important to the exponents of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Forms than the existence of the Ideas; for they imply that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot the Dyad that is primary, but Number; and that the relative is\n\t\t\t\t\tprior to number, and therefore to the absolute; and all the other\n\t\t\t\t\tconclusions in respect of which certain persons by following up the\n\t\t\t\t\tviews held about the Forms have gone against the principles of the\n\t\t\t\t\ttheory. Again, according to the assumption by which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey hold that the Ideas exist,there will be Forms not only of substances but of\n\t\t\t\t\tmany other things (since the concept is one not only in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances but in the case of non-substantial things as well; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthere can be sciences not only of substances but also of other things;\n\t\t\t\t\tand there are a thousand other similar consequences);but it follows necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the views generally held about them that if the Forms are\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipated in, there can only be Ideas of substances, because they\n\t\t\t\t\tare not participated in accidentally; things can only participate in a\n\t\t\t\t\tForm in so far as it is not predicated of a subject.I mean, e.g., that if a thing\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipates in absolute doubleness, it participates also in something\n\t\t\t\t\teternal, but only accidentally; because it is an accident of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"doubleness\" to be eternal. Thus the Ideas will be substance. But the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame terms denote substance in the sensible as in the Ideal world;\n\t\t\t\t\totherwise what meaning will there be in saying that something exists\n\t\t\t\t\tbesides the particulars, i.e. the unity comprising their\n\t\t\t\t\tmultiplicity?If the\n\t\t\t\t\tform of the Ideas and of the things which participate in them is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame, they will have something in common (for why should duality mean\n\t\t\t\t\tone and the same thing in the case of perishable 2's and the 2's which\n\t\t\t\t\tare many but eternal, and not in the case of absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tduality and a particular 2?). But if the form is not the same, they\n\t\t\t\t\twill simply be homonyms; just as though one were to call both Callias\n\t\t\t\t\tand a piece of wood \"man,\" without remarking any property common to\n\t\t\t\t\tthem.And if we profess\n\t\t\t\t\tthat in all other respects the common definitions apply to the Forms,\n\t\t\t\t\te.g. that \"plane figure\" and the other parts of the definition apply\n\t\t\t\t\tto the Ideal circle, only that we must also state of what the Form is\n\t\t\t\t\ta Form, we must beware lest this is a quite meaningless\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement. For to\n\t\t\t\t\twhat element of the definition must the addition be made? to \"center,\"\n\t\t\t\t\tor \"plane\" or all of them? For all the elements in the essence of an\n\t\t\t\t\tIdea are Ideas; e.g. \"animal\" and \"two-footed.\" Further, it is obvious that \"being an Idea,\" just like\n\t\t\t\t\t\"plane,\" must be a definite characteristic which belongs as genus to\n\t\t\t\t\tall its species.Above all we\n\t\t\t\t\tmight examine the question what on earth the Ideas contribute to\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible things, whether eternal or subject to generation and decay;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor they are not the cause of any motion or change in them.Moreover they are no help\n\t\t\t\t\ttowards the knowledge of other things (for they are not the substance\n\t\t\t\t\tof particulars, otherwise they would be  particulars)\n\t\t\t\t\tor to their existence (since they are not present in the things which\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipate in them. If they were, they might perhaps seem to be\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses, in the sense in which the admixture of white causes a thing to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe white. But this theory, which was stated\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst by Anaxagoras and later by Eudoxus in his discussion of\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties, and by others also, is very readily refuted; for it is\n\t\t\t\t\teasy to adduce plenty of impossibilities against such a view). Again,\n\t\t\t\t\tother things are not in any accepted sense derived from the\n\t\t\t\t\tForms.To say that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Forms are patterns, and that other things participate in them, is\n\t\t\t\t\tto use empty phrases and poetical metaphors; for what is it that\n\t\t\t\t\tfashions things on the model of the Ideas? Besides, anything may both\n\t\t\t\t\tbe and come to be without being imitated from something else; thus a\n\t\t\t\t\tman may become like Socrates\n\t\t\t\t\twhether Socrates exists or\n\t\t\t\t\tnot,and even if\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates were eternal,\n\t\t\t\t\tclearly the case would be the same. Also there will be several\n\t\t\t\t\t\"patterns\" (and therefore Forms) of the same thing; e.g., \"animal\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"two-footed\" will be patterns of \"man,\" and so too will the Idea of\n\t\t\t\t\tman.Further, the\n\t\t\t\t\tForms will be patterns not only of sensible things but of Ideas; e.g.\n\t\t\t\t\tthe genus will be the pattern of its species; hence the same thing\n\t\t\t\t\twill be pattern and copy. Further, it would seem impossible for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance and that of which it is the substance to exist in\n\t\t\t\t\tseparation; then how can the Ideas, if they are the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances of things, exist in separation from them?In the this\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement is made: that the Forms are causes both of being and of\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration. Yet assuming that the Forms exist, still there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration unless there is something to impart motion; and many other\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are generated (e.g. house and ring) of which the Idealists say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat there are no Forms.Thus it is clearly possible that those things of which they say that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are Ideas may also exist and be generated through the same kind\n\t\t\t\t\tof causes as those of the things which we have just mentioned, and not\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause of the Forms. Indeed, as regards the Ideas, we can collect\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst them plenty of evidence similar to that which we have now\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidered; not only by the foregoing methods, but by means of more\n\t\t\t\t\tabstract and exact reasoning. Now that we have dealt with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe problems concerning the Ideas, we had better re-investigate the\n\t\t\t\t\tproblems connected with numbers that follow from the theory that\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers are separate substances and primary causes of existing things.\n\t\t\t\t\tNow if number is a kind of entity, and has nothing else as its\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, but only number itself, as some maintain; then either (a)\n\t\t\t\t\tthere must be some one part of number which is primary, and some other\n\t\t\t\t\tpart next in succession, and so on, each part being specifically\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent and this applies directly to units,\n\t\t\t\t\tand any given unit is inaddible to any other given unit;or (b) they are all\n\t\t\t\t\tdirectly successive, and any units can be added to any other units, as\n\t\t\t\t\tis held of mathematical number; for in mathematical number no one unit\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffers in any way from another.Or (c) some units must be addible and others\n\t\t\t\t\tnot. E.g., 2 is first after 1, and then 3, and so on with the other\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers; and the units in each number are addible, e.g. the units in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first2 are addible to one another, and those in the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst 3 to one another, and so on in the case of the other numbers;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut the units in the Ideal 2 are inaddible to those in the Ideal\n\t\t\t\t\t3;and similarly in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe case of the other successive numbers. Hence whereas mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber is counted thus: after 1, 2 (which consists of another 1 added\n\t\t\t\t\tto the former) and 3 (which consists of another 1 added to these two)\n\t\t\t\t\tand the other numbers in the same way, Ideal number is counted like\n\t\t\t\t\tthis: after 1, a distinct 2 not including the original 1; and a 3 not\n\t\t\t\t\tincluding the 2, and the rest of the numbers similarly.Or (d) one kind of number must\n\t\t\t\t\tbe such as we first described, and another or such as the\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematicians maintain, and that which we have last described must be\n\t\t\t\t\ta third kind.Again, these numbers must\n\t\t\t\t\texist either in separation from things, or not\n\t\t\t\t\tin separation, but in sensible things (not, however, in the way which\n\t\t\t\t\twe first considered, but in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsense that sensible things are composed of numbers which are present\n\t\t\t\t\tin them)either\n\t\t\t\t\tsome of them and not others, or all of them. These are of necessity the only ways\n\t\t\t\t\tin which the numbers can exist. Now of those who say that unity is the\n\t\t\t\t\tbeginning and substance and element of all things, and that number is\n\t\t\t\t\tderived from it and something else, almost everyone has described\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber in one of these ways (except that no one has maintained that\n\t\t\t\t\tall units are inaddible);and\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is natural enough, because there can be no other way apart from\n\t\t\t\t\tthose which we have mentioned. Some hold that both kinds of number\n\t\t\t\t\texist, that which involves priority and posteriority being identical\n\t\t\t\t\twith the Ideas, and mathematical number being distinct from Ideas and\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible things, and both kinds being separable from sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings; others hold that\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical number alone exists, being the primary reality and separate from\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible things. The Pythagoreans also believe in one\n\t\t\t\t\tkind of numberthe mathematical; only they maintain that it\n\t\t\t\t\tis not separate, but that sensible substances are composed of it. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthey construct the whole universe of numbers, but not of numbers\n\t\t\t\t\tconsisting of abstract units;they suppose the units to be extendedbut as for how the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst extended unit was formed they appear to be at a loss. Another thinker holds that\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary or Ideal number alone exists; and some identify this with mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber.The same applies in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase of lines, planes and solids.Some distinguish mathematical objects from those which\n\t\t\t\t\t\"come after the Ideas\"; and of those who treat the subject\n\t\t\t\t\tin a different manner some speak of the mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects and in a mathematical wayviz. those who do not\n\t\t\t\t\tregard the Ideas as numbers, nor indeed hold that the Ideas\n\t\t\t\t\texistand others speak of the mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects, but not in a mathematical way; for they deny that every\n\t\t\t\t\tspatial magnitude is divisible into extended magnitudes, or that any\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo given units make 2.But all who hold that Unity is an element and principle of existing\n\t\t\t\t\tthings regard numbers as consisting of abstract units, except the\n\t\t\t\t\tPythagoreans; and they regard number as having spatial magnitude, as\n\t\t\t\t\thas been previously stated.It is clear from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe foregoing account (1.) in how many ways it is possible to speak of\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers, and that all the ways have been described. They are all\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible, but doubtless some are more so than others.\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst, then, we must inquire whether the limits are addible or\n\t\t\t\t\tinaddible; and if inaddible, in which of the two\n\t\t\t\t\tways which we have distinguished. For it is possible either (a) that any one unit is\n\t\t\t\t\tinaddible to any other, or (b) that the units in the Ideal 2 are\n\t\t\t\t\tinaddible to those in the Ideal 3, and thus that the units in each\n\t\t\t\t\tIdeal number are inaddible to those in the other Ideal\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers. Now if all units are addible and do not\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffer in kind, we get one type of number only, the mathematical, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Ideas cannot be the numbers thus produced;for how can we regard the Idea of Man\n\t\t\t\t\tor Animal, or any other Form, as a number? There is one Idea of each\n\t\t\t\t\tkind of thing: e.g. one of Humanity and another one of Animality; but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe numbers which are similar and do not differ in kind are infinitely\n\t\t\t\t\tmany, so that this is no more the Idea of Man than any other 3 is. But\n\t\t\t\t\tif the Ideas are not numbers, they cannot exist at all;for from what principles can\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Ideas be derived? Number is derived from Unity and the\n\t\t\t\t\tindeterminate dyad, and the principles and elements are said to be the\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples and elements of number, and the Ideas cannot be placed\n\t\t\t\t\teither as prior or as posterior to numbers. But if the units are inaddible in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsense that any one unit is inaddible to any other, the number so\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed can be neither mathematical number (since mathematical number\n\t\t\t\t\tconsists of units which do not differ,and the facts demonstrated of it fit in with this\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacter) nor Ideal number. For on this view 2 will not be the first\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber generated from Unity and the indeterminate dyad, and then the\n\t\t\t\t\tother numbers in succession, as they say 2, 3, because the\n\t\t\t\t\tunits in the primary 2 are generated at the same time, whether,\n\t\t\t\t\tas the originator of the theory held, from unequals(coming into being when these were\n\t\t\t\t\tequalized), or otherwise since if we regard the one unit as prior to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other, it will be prior\n\t\t\t\t\talso to the 2 which is composed of them; because whenever one thing is\n\t\t\t\t\tprior and another posterior, their compound will be prior to the\n\t\t\t\t\tlatter and posterior to the former.\n\t\t\t\t\tFurther, since the Ideal 1 is first, and then comes a particular 1\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is first of the other 1's but second after the Ideal 1, and then\n\t\t\t\t\ta third 1 which is nextafter the second\n\t\t\t\t\tbut third after the first 1, it follows that the units will be prior\n\t\t\t\t\tto the numbers after which they are called; e.g., there will be a\n\t\t\t\t\tthird unit in 2 before 3 exists, and a fourth and fifth in 3 before\n\t\t\t\t\tthese numbers exist. It is true that nobody has represented\n\t\t\t\t\tthe units of numbers as inaddible in this way; but according to the\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples held by these thinkers even this view is quite reasonable,\n\t\t\t\t\talthough in actual fact it is\n\t\t\t\t\tuntenable.For\n\t\t\t\t\tassuming that there is a first unit or first 1, it is reasonable that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe units should be prior and posterior; and similarly in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\t2's, if there is a first 2. For it is reasonable and indeed necessary\n\t\t\t\t\tthat after the first there should be a second; and if a second, a\n\t\t\t\t\tthird; and so on with the rest in sequence.But the two statements, that there is after 1\n\t\t\t\t\ta first and a second unit, and that there is a first 2, are\n\t\t\t\t\tincompatible. These thinkers, however, recognize a first unit and\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst 1, but not a second and third; and they recognize a first 2, but\n\t\t\t\t\tnot a second and third.It is also\n\t\t\t\t\tevident that if all units are inaddible, there cannot be an Ideal 2\n\t\t\t\t\tand 3, and similarly with the other numbers;for whether the units are indistinguishable or\n\t\t\t\t\teach is different in kind from every other, numbers must be produced\n\t\t\t\t\tby addition; e.g. 2 by adding 1 to another 1, and 3 by adding another\n\t\t\t\t\t1 to the 2, and 4 similarly.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis being so, numbers cannot be generated as these thinkers try to\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerate them, from Unity and the dyad; because 2 becomes a part of\n\t\t\t\t\t3, and 3 of 4,and the same applies to the following\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers.But\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to them 4 was generated from the first 2 and the\n\t\t\t\t\tindeterminate dyad, thus consisting of two 2's apart from the Ideal\n\t\t\t\t\t2.\n\t\t\t\t\tOtherwise 4 will consist of the Ideal 2 and another 2 added to it, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Ideal 2 will consist of the Ideal 1 and another 1; and if this is\n\t\t\t\t\tso the other element cannot be the indeterminate dyad, because it\n\t\t\t\t\tproduces one unit and not a definite 2. Again, how can there be other 3's and 2's besides the Ideal numbers\n\t\t\t\t\t3 and 2, and in what way can they be composed of prior and posterior\n\t\t\t\t\tunits? All these theories are absurd and fictitious, and there can be\n\t\t\t\t\tno primary 2 and Ideal 3. Yet there must be, if we are to regard Unity\n\t\t\t\t\tand the indeterminate dyad as elements. But if the consequences are\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible, the principles cannot be of this nature.If, then, any one unit differs in kind from any\n\t\t\t\t\tother, these and other similar consequences necessarily follow. If, on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other hand, while the units in different numbers are different,\n\t\t\t\t\tthose which are in the same number are alone indistinguishable from\n\t\t\t\t\tone another, even so the consequences which follow are no less\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult.  For example, in the Ideal number 10 there are\n\t\t\t\t\tten units, and 10 is composed both of these and of two 5's. Now since\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Ideal 10 is not a chance number, and is not composed of chance 5's, any more than of\n\t\t\t\t\tchance units, the units in this number 10 must be different;for if they are not different,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe 5's of which the 10 is composed will not be different; but since\n\t\t\t\t\tthese are different, the units must be different too. Now if the units\n\t\t\t\t\tare different, will there or will there not be other 5's in this 10,\n\t\t\t\t\tand not only the two? If there are not, the thing is absurd; whereas if there are, what\n\t\t\t\t\tsort of 10 will be composed of them? for there is no other 10 in 10\n\t\t\t\t\tbesides the 10 itself: Again, it must also be true\n\t\t\t\t\tthat 4 is not composed of chance 2's. For according to them the\n\t\t\t\t\tindeterminate dyad, receiving the determinate dyad, made two dyads;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor it was capable of duplicating that which it received. Again, how is it possible\n\t\t\t\t\tthat 2 can be a definite entity existing besides the two units, and 3\n\t\t\t\t\tbesides the three units? Either by participation of the one in the\n\t\t\t\t\tother, as \"white man\" exists besides \"white\" and \"man,\" because it\n\t\t\t\t\tpartakes of these concepts; or when the one is a differentia of the\n\t\t\t\t\tother, as \"man\" exists besides \"animal\" and \"two-footed.\"Again, some\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are one by contact, others by mixture, and others by position;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut none of these alternatives can possibly apply to the units of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich 2 and 3 consist. Just as two men do not constitute any one thing\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinct from both of them, so it must be with the units.The fact that the units are\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible will make no difference; because points are indivisible\n\t\t\t\t\talso, but nevertheless a pair of points is not anything distinct from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe two single points.Moreover we must\n\t\t\t\t\tnot fail to realize this: that on this theory it follows that 2's are\n\t\t\t\t\tprior and posterior, and the other numbers similarly.Let it be granted that the 2's\n\t\t\t\t\tin 4 are contemporaneous; yet they are prior to those in 8, and just\n\t\t\t\t\tas the <determinate> 2 produced the 2's in 4, so they produced\n\t\t\t\t\tthe 4's in 8. Hence if the original 2 is an Idea, these 2's will also\n\t\t\t\t\tbe Ideas of a sort.And\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same argument applies to the units, because the units in the\n\t\t\t\t\toriginal 2 produce the four units in 4; and so all the units become\n\t\t\t\t\tIdeas, and an Idea will be composed of Ideas. Hence clearly those\n\t\t\t\t\tthings also of which these things are Ideas will be composite;\n\t\t\t\t\te.g., one might say that animals are\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of animals, if there are Ideas of animals. In\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral, to regard units as different in any way whatsoever is absurd\n\t\t\t\t\tand fictitious (by \"fictitious\" I mean \"dragged in to support a\n\t\t\t\t\thypothesis\"). For we can see that one unit differs from another\n\t\t\t\t\tneither in quantity nor in quality; and a number must be either equal\n\t\t\t\t\tor unequalthis applies to all numbers, but especially to\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers consisting of abstract units.Thus if a number is neither more nor less, it\n\t\t\t\t\tis equal; and things which are equal and entirely without difference\n\t\t\t\t\twe assume, in the sphere of number, to be identical. Otherwise even\n\t\t\t\t\tthe 2's in the Ideal 10 will be different, although they are equal;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor if anyone maintains that they are not different, what reason will\n\t\t\t\t\the be able to allege? Again, if every unit plus\n\t\t\t\t\tanother unit makes 2, a unit from the Ideal 2 plus one from the Ideal\n\t\t\t\t\t3 will make 2a 2 composed of different units; will this be prior or posterior to 3?\n\t\t\t\t\tIt rather seems that it must be prior, because one of the units is\n\t\t\t\t\tcontemporaneous with 3, and the other with 2. We\n\t\t\t\t\tassume that in general 1 and 1, whether the things are equal or\n\t\t\t\t\tunequal, make 2; e.g. good and bad, or man and horse; but the\n\t\t\t\t\tsupporters of this theory say that not even two units make\n\t\t\t\t\t2.If the number of the Ideal 3 is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot greater than that of the Ideal 2,it is strange; and if it is greater, then clearly\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is a number in it equal to the 2, so that this number is not\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent from the Ideal 2.But this is impossible, if there is a first and second number. Nor will the Ideas be numbers. For on this\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular point they are right who claim that the units must be\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent if there are to be Ideas, as has been already stated. For the\n\t\t\t\t\tform is unique; but if the units are undifferentiated, the 2's and 3's\n\t\t\t\t\twill be undifferentiated.Hence they have to say that when we count like this, l, 2, we do not\n\t\t\t\t\tadd to the already existing number; for if we do, (a) number will not\n\t\t\t\t\tbe generated from the indeterminate dyad, and (b) a number cannot be\n\t\t\t\t\tan Idea; because one Idea will pre-exist in another, and all the Forms\n\t\t\t\t\twill be parts of one Form. Thus in relation to their hypothesis they are\n\t\t\t\t\tright, but absolutely they are wrong, for their view is very\n\t\t\t\t\tdestructive, inasmuch as they will say that this point presents a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty: whether, when we count and say \"1, 2, 3,\" we count by\n\t\t\t\t\taddition or by enumerating distinct portions. But we do both;\n\t\t\t\t\tand therefore it is ridiculous to refer this point to so great a\n\t\t\t\t\tdifference in essence.  First of all it\n\t\t\t\t\twould be well to define the differentia of a number; and of a unit, if\n\t\t\t\t\tit has a differentia. Now units must differ either in quantity or in\n\t\t\t\t\tquality; and clearly neither of these alternatives can be true. \"But\n\t\t\t\t\tunits may differ, as number does, in quantity.\" But if units also\n\t\t\t\t\tdiffered in quantity, number would differ from number, although equal\n\t\t\t\t\tin number of units.Again,\n\t\t\t\t\tare the first units greater or smaller, and do the later units\n\t\t\t\t\tincrease in size, or the opposite? All these suggestions are absurd.\n\t\t\t\t\tNor can units differ in quality; for no modification can ever be\n\t\t\t\t\tapplicable to them, because these thinkers hold that even in numbers\n\t\t\t\t\tquality is a later attribute than quantity. Further, the units cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tderive quality either from unity or from the dyad; because unity has\n\t\t\t\t\tno quality, and the dyad produces quantity, because its nature causes\n\t\t\t\t\tthings to be many. If, then, the units differ in some other way, they\n\t\t\t\t\tshould most certainly state this at the outset, and explain, if\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible, with regard to the differentia of the unit, why it must\n\t\t\t\t\texist; or failing this, what differentia they mean.\n\t\t\t\t\tClearly, then, if the Ideas are numbers, the units cannot all be\n\t\t\t\t\taddible,nor can they\n\t\t\t\t\tall be inaddible in either sense. Nor again is the theory sound which\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain other thinkers hold concerning\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers.These are\n\t\t\t\t\tthey who do not believe in Ideas, either absolutely or as being a kind\n\t\t\t\t\tof numbers, but believe that the objects of mathematics exist, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the numbers are the first of existing things, and that their\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple is Unity itself. For it is absurd that if, as they say,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is a 1 which is first of the 1's, there should\n\t\t\t\t\tnot be a 2 first of the 2's, nor a 3 of the 3's; for the same\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple applies to all cases.Now if this is the truth with regard to\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber, and we posit only mathematical number as existing, Unity is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot a principle. For the Unity which is of this nature must differ\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the other units; and if so, then there must be some 2 which is\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst of the 2's; and similarly with the other numbers in\n\t\t\t\t\tsuccession.But if\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity is a principle, then the truth about numbers must rather be as\n\t\t\t\t\tPlato used to maintain; there must be a first 2 and first 3, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers cannot be addible to each other. But then again, if we assume\n\t\t\t\t\tthis, many impossibilities result, as has been already stated. Moreover, the truth must lie one\n\t\t\t\t\tway or the other; so that if neither view is sound, number cannot have a separate abstract\n\t\t\t\t\texistence. From these considerations it is also\n\t\t\t\t\tclear that the third alternativethat Ideal number and mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber are the sameis the worst; for two errors have to be\n\t\t\t\t\tcombined to make one theory. (1.) Mathematical number cannot be of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis nature, but the propounder of this view has to spin it out by\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking peculiar assumptions; (2.) his theory must admit all the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties which confront those who speak of Ideal number.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Pythagorean view in one way contains fewer difficulties than the\n\t\t\t\t\tview described above, but in another way it contains further\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties peculiar to itself. By not regarding number as separable,\n\t\t\t\t\tit disposes of many of the impossibilities; but that bodies should be\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of numbers, and that these numbers should be mathematical, is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible. For (a) it is not true to speak of indivisible magnitudes; (b) assuming that this view is\n\t\t\t\t\tperfectly true, still units at any rate have no magnitude; and how can\n\t\t\t\t\ta magnitude be composed of indivisible parts? Moreover arithmetical\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber consists of abstract units. But the Pythagoreans identify\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber with existing things; at least they apply mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tpropositions to bodies as though they consisted of those numbers. Thus if number,if it is a self-subsistent\n\t\t\t\t\treality, must be regarded in one of the ways described above, and if\n\t\t\t\t\tit cannot be regarded in any of these ways, clearly number has no such\n\t\t\t\t\tnature as is invented for it by those who treat it as\n\t\t\t\t\tseparable. Again, does each unit come from the\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat and the Small, when they are equalized; or does one come from the Small and another from the\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat? If the latter, each thing is not composed of all the elements,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor are the units undifferentiated; for one contains the Great, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other the Small, which is by nature contrary to the\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat.Again, what\n\t\t\t\t\tof the units in the Ideal 3? because there is one over. But no doubt\n\t\t\t\t\tit is for this reason that in an odd number they make the Ideal One\n\t\t\t\t\tthe middle unit. If on the\n\t\t\t\t\tother hand each of the units comes from both Great and Small, when\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are equalized, how can the Ideal 2 be a single entity composed of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Great and Small? How will it differ from one of its units? Again,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe unit is prior to the 2; because when the unit disappears the 2\n\t\t\t\t\tdisappears.Therefore the unit must be the Idea of an Idea, since it is prior to\n\t\t\t\t\tan Idea, and must have been generated before it. From what, then? for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe indeterminate dyad, as we have seen,\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses duality.Again, number must be\n\t\t\t\t\teither infinite or finite (for they make number separable, so that one of these alternatives must be\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue). Now\n\t\t\t\t\tit is obvious that it cannot be infinite, because infinite number is\n\t\t\t\t\tneither odd nor even, and numbers are always generated either from odd\n\t\t\t\t\tor from even number. By one process, when 1 is added to an even\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber, we get an odd number; by another, when 1 is multiplied by 2,\n\t\t\t\t\twe get ascending powers of 2; and by another, when powers of 2 are\n\t\t\t\t\tmultiplied by odd numbers, we get the remaining even\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers. Again, if every Idea is an Idea of\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething, and the numbers are Ideas, infinite number will also be an\n\t\t\t\t\tIdea of something, either sensible or otherwise. This, however, is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible, both logically and on their own\n\t\t\t\t\tassumption, since they regard the Ideas as they\n\t\t\t\t\tdo.If, on the other hand, number\n\t\t\t\t\tis finite, what is its limit? In reply to this we must not only assert\n\t\t\t\t\tthe fact, but give the reason.Now if number only goes up to 10, as some\n\t\t\t\t\thold, in the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst place the Forms will soon run short. For example, if 3 is the\n\t\t\t\t\tIdea of Man, what number will be the Idea of Horse? Each number up to\n\t\t\t\t\t10 is an Idea; the Idea of Horse, then, must be one of the numbers in\n\t\t\t\t\tthis series, for they are substances or Ideas.But the fact remains that they will run\n\t\t\t\t\tshort, because the different types of animals will outnumber them. At\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same time it is clear that if in this way the Ideal 3 is the Idea\n\t\t\t\t\tof Man, so will the other 3's be also (for the 3's in the same\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers are\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar),so that\n\t\t\t\t\tthere will be an infinite number of men; and if each 3 is an Idea,\n\t\t\t\t\teach man will be an Idea of Man; or if not, they will still be\n\t\t\t\t\tmen.And if the\n\t\t\t\t\tsmaller number is part of the greater, when it is composed of the\n\t\t\t\t\taddible units contained in the same number, then if the Ideal 4 is the\n\t\t\t\t\tIdea of something, e.g. \"horse\" or \"white,\" then \"man\" will be part of\n\t\t\t\t\t\"horse,\" if \"man\" is 2. It is absurd also that there should be an Idea\n\t\t\t\t\tof 10 and not of 11, nor of the following numbers.\n\t\t\t\t\tAgain, some things exist and come into being of which there are no\n\t\t\t\t\tForms; why, then, are there not Forms of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese too? It follows that the Forms are not the causes of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings.Again, it is absurd that\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber up to 10 should be more really existent, and a Form, than 10\n\t\t\t\t\titself; although the former is not generated as a unity, whereas the\n\t\t\t\t\tlatter is. However, they try to make out that the series up to 10 is a\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete number;at least\n\t\t\t\t\tthey generate the derivatives, e.g. the void, proportion, the odd,\n\t\t\t\t\tetc., from within the decad. Some, such as motion, rest, good and\n\t\t\t\t\tevil, they assign to the first principles; the rest to numbers. Hence they identify the odd with Unity;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause if oddness depended on 3, how could 5 be odd?Again, they hold that spatial magnitudes and the\n\t\t\t\t\tlike have a certain limit; e.g. the first or\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible line, then the 2, and so on; these too extending up to\n\t\t\t\t\t10.Again, if\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber is separable, the question might be raised whether Unity is\n\t\t\t\t\tprior, or 3 or 2.Now if\n\t\t\t\t\twe regard number as composite, Unity is prior; but if we regard the\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal or form as prior, number is prior, because each unit is a\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterial part of number, while number is the form of the units. And\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is a sense in which the right angle is prior to the acute\n\t\t\t\t\tanglesince it is definite and is involved in the definition\n\t\t\t\t\tof the acute angleand another sense in which the acute\n\t\t\t\t\tangle is prior, because it is a part of the other, i.e., the right\n\t\t\t\t\tangle is divided into acute angles.Thus regarded as matter the acute angle and\n\t\t\t\t\telement and unit are prior; but with respect to form and substance in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sense of formula, the right angle, and the whole composed of\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter and form, is prior. For the concrete whole is nearer to the\n\t\t\t\t\tform or subject of the definition, although in generation it is\n\t\t\t\t\tposterior.In what sense, then, is the One a first principle?\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause, they say, it is indivisible.But the universal and the part or element are\n\t\t\t\t\talso indivisible. Yes, but they are prior in a different sense; the\n\t\t\t\t\tone in formula and the other in time. In which sense, then, is the One\n\t\t\t\t\ta first principle? for, as we have just said, both the right angle\n\t\t\t\t\tseems to be prior to the acute angle, and the latter prior to the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer; and each of them is one.Accordingly the Platonists make the One a\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst principle in both senses. But this is impossible; for in one\n\t\t\t\t\tsense it is the One  form or\n\t\t\t\t\tessence,and in the\n\t\t\t\t\tother the One  part or matter, that is\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary. There is a sense in which both number and unit are one; they\n\t\t\t\t\tare so in truth potentiallythat is, if a number is not an\n\t\t\t\t\taggregate but a unity consisting of units distinct from those of other\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers, as the Platonists hold but each of the two units is not one in\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete reality. The cause of the error which befell the Platonists\n\t\t\t\t\twas that they were pursuing their inquiry from two points of\n\t\t\t\t\tviewthat of mathematics and that of general\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinitionat the same time. Hence as a result of the former\n\t\t\t\t\tthey conceived of the One or first principle as a point, for the unit\n\t\t\t\t\tis a point without position. (Thus they too, just like certain\n\t\t\t\t\tothers,represented\n\t\t\t\t\texisting things as composed of that which is smallest.) We get,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, that the unit is the material element of numbers, and at the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame time is prior to the number 2; and again we get that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tposterior to 2 regarded as a whole or unity or form. On the other\n\t\t\t\t\thand, through looking for the universal, they were led to speak of the\n\t\t\t\t\tunity predicated of a given number as a part in the formal sense also.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut these two characteristics cannot belong simultaneously to the same\n\t\t\t\t\tthing. And if Unity itself must only be without\n\t\t\t\t\tposition(for it differs only in that it is a principle) and 2\n\t\t\t\t\tis divisible whereas the unit is not, the unit will be more nearly\n\t\t\t\t\takin to Unity itself; and if this is so, Unity itself will also be\n\t\t\t\t\tmore nearly akin to the unit than to 2. Hence each of the units in 2\n\t\t\t\t\twill be prior to 2. But this they deny; at least they make out that 2\n\t\t\t\t\tis generated first.\n\t\t\t\t\tFurther, if 2 itself and 3 itself are each one\n\t\t\t\t\tthing, both together make 2. From what, then, does this 2\n\t\t\t\t\tcome? Since there is no contact in numbers, but\n\t\t\t\t\tunits which have nothing between theme.g. those in 2 or\n\t\t\t\t\t3are successive, the question might be raised whether or\n\t\t\t\t\tnot they are successive to Unity itself, and whether of the numbers\n\t\t\t\t\twhich succeed it 2 or one of the units in 2 is prior. We\n\t\t\t\t\tfind similar difficulties in the case of the genera posterior to\n\t\t\t\t\tnumberthe line, plane and solid. Some derive these from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe species of the Great and Small; viz. lines from the Long and\n\t\t\t\t\tShort, planes from the Broad and Narrow, and solids from the Deep and\n\t\t\t\t\tShallow. These are species of the Great and Small.As for the geometrical first principle\n\t\t\t\t\twhich corresponds to the arithmetical One, different Platonists\n\t\t\t\t\tpropound different views. In these too we can\n\t\t\t\t\tsee innumerable impossibilities, fictions and contradictions of all\n\t\t\t\t\treasonable probability. For (a) we get that the geometrical forms are\n\t\t\t\t\tunconnected with each other, unless their principles also are so\n\t\t\t\t\tassociated that the Broad and Narrow is also Long and Short; and if\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is so, the plane will be a line and the solid a plane. Moreover, how can angles and figures, etc.,\n\t\t\t\t\tbe explained? And (b) the same result follows as in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber; for these concepts are modifications of magnitude, but\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnitude is not generated from them, any more than a line is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated from the Straight and Crooked, or solids from the Smooth and\n\t\t\t\t\tRough. Common to all these Platonic theories is the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame problem which presents itself in the case of species of a genus\n\t\t\t\t\twhen we posit universalsviz. whether it is the Ideal animal\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is present in the particular animal, or some other \"animal\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinct from the Ideal animal. This question will cause no difficulty\n\t\t\t\t\tif the universal is not separable; but if, as the Platonists say,\n\t\t\t\t\tUnity and the numbers exist separately, then it is not easy to solve\n\t\t\t\t\t(if we should apply the phrase \"not easy\" to what is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible).For when\n\t\t\t\t\twe think of the one in 2, or in number generally, are we thinking of\n\t\t\t\t\tan Idea or of something else?These\n\t\t\t\t\tthinkers, then, generate geometrical magnitudes from this sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tmaterial principle, but others generate them from the point (they regard the point\n\t\t\t\t\tnot as a unity but as similar to Unity) and another material principle\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is not plurality but is similar to it; yet in the case of these\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples none the less we get the same difficulties.For if the matter is one, line,\n\t\t\t\t\tplane and solid will be the same; because the product of the same\n\t\t\t\t\telements must be one and the same. If on the other hand\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is more than one kind of matterone of the line,\n\t\t\t\t\tanother of the plane, and another of the solideither the\n\t\t\t\t\tkinds are associated with each other, or they are not. Thus the same\n\t\t\t\t\tresult will follow in this case also; for either the plane will not\n\t\t\t\t\tcontain a line, or it will be a line. Further, no\n\t\t\t\t\tattempt is made to explain how number can be generated from unity and\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality; but howsoever they account for this, they have to meet the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame difficulties as those who generate number from unity and the\n\t\t\t\t\tindeterminate dyad. The one school generates number not from a\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular plurality but from that which is universally predicated;\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other from a particular plurality, but the first; for they hold\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the dyad is the first plurality. Thus there is practically no difference\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween the two views; the same difficulties will be involved with\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to mixture, position, blending, generation and the other\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar modes of combination.We might very well ask the further question: if\n\t\t\t\t\teach unit is one, of what it is composed; for clearly each unit is not\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolute unity. It must be generated from absolute unity and either\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality or a part of plurality.Now we cannot hold that the unit is a\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality, because the unit is indivisible; but the view that it is\n\t\t\t\t\tderived from a part of plurality involves many further difficulties,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause (a) each part must be indivisible; otherwise it will be a\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality and the unit will be divisible,and unity and plurality will not be its elements,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause each unit will not be generated from plurality and unity.(b) The exponent of this theory merely\n\t\t\t\t\tintroduces another number; because plurality is a number of\n\t\t\t\t\tindivisible parts.Again, we must\n\t\t\t\t\tinquire from the exponent of this theory whether the number is infinite or finite.There was, it appears, a finite\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality from which, in combination with Unity, the finite units were\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated; and absolute plurality is different from finite plurality.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat sort of plurality is it, then, that is, in combination with\n\t\t\t\t\tunity, an element of number?We might\n\t\t\t\t\task a similar question with regard to the point, i.e. the element out\n\t\t\t\t\tof which they create spatial magnitudes.This is surely not the one and only point. At\n\t\t\t\t\tleast we may ask from what each of the other points comes; it is not,\n\t\t\t\t\tcertainly, from some interval and the Ideal point. Moreover, the parts\n\t\t\t\t\tof the interval cannot be indivisible parts, any more than the parts\n\t\t\t\t\tof the plurality of which the units are composed; because although\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber is composed of indivisible parts, spatial magnitudes are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot. All these and other similar considerations\n\t\t\t\t\tmake it clear that number and spatial magnitudes cannot exist\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately. Further, the fact that the leading\n\t\t\t\t\tauthorities disagree about numbers indicates that it is the\n\t\t\t\t\tmisrepresentation of the facts themselves that produces this confusion\n\t\t\t\t\tin their views.Those who recognize only the objects of mathematics as\n\t\t\t\t\texisting besides sensible things, abandoned Ideal number and posited\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical number because they perceived the difficulty and\n\t\t\t\t\tartificiality of the Ideal theory. Others, wishing to\n\t\t\t\t\tmaintain both Forms and numbers, but not seeing how, if one posits\n\t\t\t\t\tthese as first principles,\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical number can exist besides Ideal number, identified Ideal\n\t\t\t\t\twith mathematical number,but only in theory, since actually\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical number is done away with, because the hypotheses which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey state are peculiar to them and not mathematical. And he who first assumed that there are Ideas, and that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Ideas are numbers, and that the objects of mathematics exist,\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally separated them. Thus it happens that all are right in some\n\t\t\t\t\trespect, but not altogether right; even they themselves admit as much\n\t\t\t\t\tby not agreeing but contradicting each other. The reason of this is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat their assumptions and first principles are wrong;and it is difficult to\n\t\t\t\t\tpropound a correct theory from faulty premisses: as Epicharmus says,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"no sooner is it said than it is seen to be wrong.\"We have\n\t\t\t\t\tnow examined and analyzed the questions concerning numbers to a\n\t\t\t\t\tsufficient extent; for although one who is already convinced might be\n\t\t\t\t\tstill more convinced by a fuller treatment,he who is not convinced would be\n\t\t\t\t\tbrought no nearer to conviction.As for the first principles and causes and\n\t\t\t\t\telements, the views expressed by those who discuss only sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance either have been described in the or have no place in\n\t\t\t\t\tour present inquiry; but the views of those who assert that there are\n\t\t\t\t\tother substances besides sensible ones call for investigation next\n\t\t\t\t\tafter those which we have just discussed. Since, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tsome thinkers hold that the Ideas and numbers are such substances, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat their elements are the elements and principles of reality, we\n\t\t\t\t\tmust inquire what it is that they hold, and in what sense they hold\n\t\t\t\t\tit. Those who posit only numbers,\n\t\t\t\t\tand mathematical numbers at that, may be considered later; but as\n\t\t\t\t\tfor those who speak of the Ideas, we can observe at the same time\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir way of thinking and the difficulties which befall them. For they\n\t\t\t\t\tnot only treat the Ideas as universal substances, but also as\n\t\t\t\t\tseparable and particular.(That this is impossible has been already shown by a consideration of the\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties involved.) The reason why those who hold substances to be\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal combined these two views was that they did not identify\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances with sensible things. They considered that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe particulars in the sensible world are in a state of flux, and that\n\t\t\t\t\tnone of them persists, but that the universal exists besides them and\n\t\t\t\t\tis something distinct from them.This theory, as we have said in an earlier\n\t\t\t\t\tpassage, was initiated by\n\t\t\t\t\tSocrates as a result of his definitions, but he did\n\t\t\t\t\tnot separate universals from particulars; and he was right in not\n\t\t\t\t\tseparating them. This is evident from the facts; for without the\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal we cannot acquire knowledge, and the separation of the\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal is the cause of the difficulties which we find in the Ideal\n\t\t\t\t\ttheory.Others,\n\t\t\t\t\tregarding it as necessary, if there are to be any substances besides\n\t\t\t\t\tthose which are sensible and transitory, that they should be\n\t\t\t\t\tseparable, and having no other substances, assigned separate existence\n\t\t\t\t\tto those which are universally predicated; thus it followed that\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversals and particulars are practically the same kind of thing.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis in itself would be one difficulty in the view which we have just\n\t\t\t\t\tdescribed. Let us now mention a point\n\t\t\t\t\twhich presents some difficulty both to those who hold the Ideal theory\n\t\t\t\t\tand to those who do not. It has been stated already, at the beginning\n\t\t\t\t\tof our treatise, among the problems. If we do\n\t\t\t\t\tnot suppose substances to be separate, that is in the way in which\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular things are said to be separate, we shall do away with\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance in the sense in which we wish to maintain it; but if we\n\t\t\t\t\tsuppose substances to be separable,how are we to regard their elements and\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples?If they\n\t\t\t\t\tare particular and not universal, there will be as many real things as\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are elements, and the elements will not be knowable. For let us\n\t\t\t\t\tsuppose that the syllables in speech are substances, and that their\n\t\t\t\t\tletters are the elements of substances. Then there must be only one\n\t\t\t\t\tBA, and only one of each of the other syllables; that is, if they are\n\t\t\t\t\tnot universal and identical in form, but each is numerically one and\n\t\t\t\t\tan individual, and not a member of a class bearing a common\n\t\t\t\t\tname.(Moreover, the\n\t\t\t\t\tPlatonists assume that each Ideal entity is unique.) Now if this is\n\t\t\t\t\ttrue of the syllables, it is also true of their letters. Hence there\n\t\t\t\t\twill not be more than one A, nor more than one of any of the other\n\t\t\t\t\tletters, on the same\n\t\t\t\t\targument by which in the case of the syllable there cannot be more\n\t\t\t\t\tthan one instance of the same syllable. But if this is so, there will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe no other things besides the letters, but only the\n\t\t\t\t\tletters. Nor again will the elements be\n\t\t\t\t\tknowable; for they will not be universal, and knowledge is of the\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal. This can be seen by reference to proofs and definitions;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor there is no logical conclusion that a given triangle has its\n\t\t\t\t\tangles equal to two right angles unless every triangle has its angles\n\t\t\t\t\tequal to two right angles, or that a given man is an animal unless\n\t\t\t\t\tevery man is an animal.  On\n\t\t\t\t\tthe other hand, if the first principles are universal, either the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances composed of them will be universal too, or there will be a\n\t\t\t\t\tnon-substance prior to substance; because the universal is not\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, and the element or first principle is universal; and the\n\t\t\t\t\telement or first principle is prior to that of which it is an element\n\t\t\t\t\tor first principle.All\n\t\t\t\t\tthis naturally follows when they compose the Ideas of elements and\n\t\t\t\t\tassert that besides the substances which have the same form there are\n\t\t\t\t\talso Ideas each of which is a separate entity.But if, as in the case of the phonetic elements,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is no reason why there should not be many A's and B's, and no \"A\n\t\t\t\t\titself\" or \"B itself\" apart from these many, then on this basis there\n\t\t\t\t\tmay be any number of similar syllables. The doctrine\n\t\t\t\t\tthat all knowledge is of the universal, and hence that the principles\n\t\t\t\t\tof existing things must also be universal and not separate substances,\n\t\t\t\t\tpresents the greatest difficulty of all that we have discussed; there\n\t\t\t\t\tis, however, a sense in which this statement is true, although there\n\t\t\t\t\tis another in which it is not true.Knowledge, like the verb \"to know,\" has two\n\t\t\t\t\tsenses, of which one is potential and the other actual. The\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiality being, as matter, universal and indefinite, has a\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal and indefinite object; but the actuality is definite and has\n\t\t\t\t\ta definite object, because it is particular and deals with the\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular.It is\n\t\t\t\t\tonly accidentally that sight sees universal color,because the particular color which it\n\t\t\t\t\tsees is color; and the particular A which the grammarian studies is an\n\t\t\t\t\tA. For if the first principles must be universal, that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tderived from them must also be universal, as in the case of logical\n\t\t\t\t\tproofs;\n\t\t\t\t\tand if this is so there will be nothing which has a separate\n\t\t\t\t\texistence; i.e. no substance. But it is clear that although in one\n\t\t\t\t\tsense knowledge is universal, in another it is not."}}, {"@n": "14", "@type": "Book", "p": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1087a", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n":

All thinkers make the first principles contraries; as in the\n\t\t\t\t\trealm of natural objects, so too in respect of the unchangeable\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances.Now if\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing can be prior to the first principle of all things, that first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple cannot be first principle if it is an attribute of something\n\t\t\t\t\telse. This would be as absurd as to say that \"white\" is the first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple, not  anything else but  white, and yet that it is predicable of a\n\t\t\t\t\tsubject, and is white because it is an attribute of something else;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the latter will be prior to it.Moreover, all things are generated from\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries as from a substrate, and therefore contraries must most\n\t\t\t\t\tcertainly have a substrate. Therefore all\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries are predicated of a subject, and none of them exists\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately. But there is no contrary to substance; not only is this\n\t\t\t\t\tapparent, but it is borne out by reasoned consideration. Thus none of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries is strictly a first principle; the first principle is\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething different. But the Platonists treat one of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries as matter, some opposing \"the unequal\" to Unity (on the\n\t\t\t\t\tground that the former is of the nature of plurality) and others\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality.For\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to some, numbers\n\t\t\t\t\tare generated from the unequal dyad of the Great and Small; and\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to another, from plurality; but in both cases they are\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated by the essence of unity. For he who speaks of \"the unequal\"\n\t\t\t\t\tand Unity as elements, and describes the unequal as a dyad composed of\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat and Small, speaks of the unequal, i.e. the Great and Small, as\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing one; and does not draw the distinction that they are one in\n\t\t\t\t\tformula but not in number.\n\t\t\t\t\tAgain, they state the first principles, which they call elements,\n\t\t\t\t\tbadly; some say that the Great and the Small, together with Unity\n\t\t\t\t\t(making 3 in all), are the elements of numbers; the two former as\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter, and Unity as form. Others speak of the Many and Few, because\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Great and the Small are in their nature more suited to be the\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples of magnitude; and others use the more general term which\n\t\t\t\t\tcovers these\"the exceeding\" and \"the exceeded.\"But none of these variations\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes any appreciable difference with respect to some of the\n\t\t\t\t\tconsequences of the theory;they only affect the abstract difficulties, which these thinkers\n\t\t\t\t\tescape because the proofs which they themselves employ are\n\t\t\t\t\tabstract.There is,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, this exception: if \"the exceeding\" and \"the exceeded\" are the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst principles, and not the Great and the Small, on the same\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple number should be derived from the elements before 2 is\n\t\t\t\t\tderived; for as \"the exceeding and the exceeded\" is more universal\n\t\t\t\t\tthan the Great and Small, so number is more universal than 2. But in\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint of fact they assert the one and not the other.Others oppose \"the different\" or \"other\" to Unity;\n\t\t\t\t\tand others contrast Plurality and Unity.Now if, as they maintain, existing things are\n\t\t\t\t\tderived from contraries, and if there is either no contrary to unity,\n\t\t\t\t\tor if there is to be any contrary it is plurality; and if the unequal\n\t\t\t\t\tis contrary to the equal, and the different to the same, and the other\n\t\t\t\t\tto the thing itself then those who oppose unity to plurality have the\n\t\t\t\t\tbest claim to credibilitybut even their theory is\n\t\t\t\t\tinadequate, because then unity will be few. For plurality is opposed\n\t\t\t\t\tto paucity, and many to few. That \"unity\" denotes a\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasure is obvious. And in every case\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is something else which underlies it; e.g., in the scale there\n\t\t\t\t\tis the quarter-tone; in spatial magnitude the inch or foot or some\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar thing; and in rhythms the foot or syllable. Similarly in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase of gravity there is some definite weight. Unity is predicated of\n\t\t\t\t\tall things in the same way; of qualities as a\n\t\t\t\t\tquality, and of quantities as a quantity.(The measure is indivisible, in the former\n\t\t\t\t\tcase in kind, and in the latter to our senses.) This shows that unity\n\t\t\t\t\tis not any independent substance. And this is reasonable; because\n\t\t\t\t\tunity denotes a measure of some plurality, and number denotes a\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasured plurality and a plurality of measures. (Hence too it stands\n\t\t\t\t\tto reason that unity is not a number; for the measure is not measures,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut the measure and unity are starting-points.)The measure must always be something\n\t\t\t\t\twhich applies to all alike; e.g., if the things are horses, the\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasure is a horse; if they are men, the measure is a man; and if they\n\t\t\t\t\tare man, horse and god, the measure will presumably be an animate\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing, and the number of them animate beings.If the things are \"man,\" \"white\" and\n\t\t\t\t\t\"walking,\" there will scarcely be a number of them, because they all\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to a subject which is one and the same in number; however,\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir number will be a number of genera, or some other such\n\t\t\t\t\tappellation. Those who regard the unequal as a\n\t\t\t\t\tunity, and the dyad as an indeterminate compound of great and small,\n\t\t\t\t\thold theories which are very far from being probable or possible. For\n\t\t\t\t\tthese terms represent affections and attributes, rather than\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstrates, of numbers and magnitudes\"many\" and \"few\"\n\t\t\t\t\tapplying to number, and \"great\" and \"small\" to\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnitudejust as odd and even, smooth and rough, straight and crooked, are\n\t\t\t\t\tattributes.Further,\n\t\t\t\t\tin addition to this error, \"great\" and \"small\" and all other such\n\t\t\t\t\tterms must be relative. And the relative is of all the categories in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe least degree a definite entity or substance; it is posterior to\n\t\t\t\t\tquality and quantity. The relative is an affection of quantity, as we\n\t\t\t\t\thave said, and not its matter; since there is something else distinct\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is the matter both of the relative in general and of its parts\n\t\t\t\t\tand kinds.There is\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing great or small, many or few, or in general relative, which is\n\t\t\t\t\tmany or few, great or small, or relative to something else without\n\t\t\t\t\thaving a distinct nature of its own. That the relative is in the\n\t\t\t\t\tlowest degree a substance and a real thing is shown by the fact that\n\t\t\t\t\tof it alone there is\n\t\t\t\t\tneither generation nor destruction nor change in the sense that in\n\t\t\t\t\trespect of quantity there is increase and decrease, in respect of\n\t\t\t\t\tquality, alteration, in respect of place, locomotion, and in respect\n\t\t\t\t\tof substance, absolute generation and destruction.There is no real change in respect of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe relative; for without any change in itself, one term will be now\n\t\t\t\t\tgreater, now smaller or equal, as the other term undergoes\n\t\t\t\t\tquantitative change. Moreover, the matter of every\n\t\t\t\t\tthing, and therefore of substance, must be that which is potentially\n\t\t\t\t\tof that nature; but the relative is neither potentially substance nor\n\t\t\t\t\tactually. It is absurd, then, or rather\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible, to represent non-substance as an element of substance and\n\t\t\t\t\tprior to it; for all the other categories are posterior to substance.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd further, the elements are not predicated of those things of which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey are elements; yet \"many\" and \"few\" are predicated, both\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately and together, of number; and \"long\" and \"short\" are\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicated of the line, and the Plane is both broad and\n\t\t\t\t\tnarrow.If, then,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is a plurality of which one term, viz. \"few,\" is always\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicable, e.g. 2 (for if 2 is many, 1 will be few), then there will be an absolute\n\t\t\t\t\t\"many\"; e.g., 10 will be many (if there is nothing more than 10), or 10,000. How, then, in this\n\t\t\t\t\tlight, can number be derived from Few and Many? Either both ought to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe predicated of it, or neither; but according to this view only one\n\t\t\t\t\tor the other is predicated. But we must inquire in general\n\t\t\t\t\twhether eternal things can be composed of elements. If so, they will\n\t\t\t\t\thave matter; for everything which consists of elements is\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposite.Assuming,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, that that which consists of anything, whether it has always\n\t\t\t\t\texisted or it came into being, must come into being <if at\n\t\t\t\t\tall> out of that of which it consists; and that everything\n\t\t\t\t\tcomes to be that which it comes to be out of that which is it\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially (for it could not have come to be out of that which was\n\t\t\t\t\tnot potentially such, nor could it have consisted of it); and that the\n\t\t\t\t\tpotential can either be actualized or not;then however everlasting number or\n\t\t\t\t\tanything else which has matter may be, it would be possible for it not\n\t\t\t\t\tto exist, just as that which is any number of years old is as capable\n\t\t\t\t\tof not existing as that which is one day old. And if this is so, that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich has existed for so long a time that there is no limit to it may\n\t\t\t\t\talso not exist.Therefore\n\t\t\t\t\tthings which contain matter cannot be eternal, that is, if that which\n\t\t\t\t\tis capable of not existing is not eternal, as we have had occasion to\n\t\t\t\t\tsay elsewhere. Now if what we have just been\n\t\t\t\t\tsayingthat no substance is eternal unless it is\n\t\t\t\t\tactualityis true universally, and the elements are the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter of substance, an eternal substance can have no elements of\n\t\t\t\t\twhich, as inherent in it, it consists. There are some\n\t\t\t\t\twho, while making the element which acts conjointly with unity the\n\t\t\t\t\tindeterminate dyad, object to \"the unequal,\" quite reasonably, on the\n\t\t\t\t\tscore of the difficulties which it involves. But they are rid only of\n\t\t\t\t\tthose difficulties which necessarily attend the theory of those who\n\t\t\t\t\tmake the unequal, i.e. the relative, an element; all the difficulties\n\t\t\t\t\twhich are independent of this view must apply to their theories also,\n\t\t\t\t\twhether it is Ideal or mathematical number that they construct out of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese elements. There are many causes for their\n\t\t\t\t\tresorting to these explanations, the chief being that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey visualized the problem in an archaic form. They supposed that all\n\t\t\t\t\texisting things would be one, absolute Being, unless they encountered\n\t\t\t\t\tand refuted Parmenides' dictum:It will\n\t\t\t\t\tne'er be proved that things which are not, are,i.e., that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey must show that that which is not, is; for only soof\n\t\t\t\t\tthat which is, and of something elsecould existing things\n\t\t\t\t\tbe composed, if they are more than one. However, (i) in the first\n\t\t\t\t\tplace, if \"being\" has several meanings (for sometimes it means\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance, sometimes quality, sometimes quantity, and so on with the\n\t\t\t\t\tother categories), what sort of unity will all the things that are\n\t\t\t\t\tconstitute, if not-being is not to be? Will it be the substances that\n\t\t\t\t\tare one, or the affections (and similarly with the other categories),\n\t\t\t\t\tor all the categories together? in which case the \"this\" and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\"such\" and the \"so great,\" and all the other categories which denote\n\t\t\t\t\tsome sense of Being, will be one.But it is absurd, or rather impossible, that\n\t\t\t\t\tthe introduction of one thing should account for the fact that \"what\n\t\t\t\t\tis\" sometimes means \"so-and-so,\" sometimes \"such-and-such,\" sometimes\n\t\t\t\t\t\"of such-and-such a size,\" sometimes \"in such-and-such a place.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t (2) Of what sort of not-being and Being do\n\t\t\t\t\treal things consist? Not-being, too, has several senses, inasmuch as\n\t\t\t\t\tBeing has; and \"not-man\" means \"not so-and-so,\" whereas \"not straight\"\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans \"not such-and-such,\" and \"not five feet long\" means \"not of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch-and-such a size.\" What sort of Being and not-being, then, make\n\t\t\t\t\texisting things a plurality? This thinker\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans by the not-being which together with Being makes existing things\n\t\t\t\t\ta plurality, falsity and everything of this nature; and for this reason also it was said that we must assume something which is false, just\n\t\t\t\t\tas geometricians assume that a line is a foot long when it is\n\t\t\t\t\tnot.But this cannot\n\t\t\t\t\tbe so; for (a) the geometricians do not assume anything that is false\n\t\t\t\t\t(since the proposition is not part of the logical inference), and (b) existing things are not generated from\n\t\t\t\t\tor resolved into not-being in this sense. But not only has \"not-being\"\n\t\t\t\t\tin its various cases as many meanings as there are categories, but\n\t\t\t\t\tmoreover the false and the potential are called \"not-being\"; and it is\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the latter that generation takes placeman comes to be\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom that which is not man but is potentially man, and white from that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is not white but is potentially white; no matter whether one\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is generated or many. Clearly the point at issue is\n\t\t\t\t\thow \"being\" in the sense of the substances is many; for the things\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are generated are numbers and lines and bodies. It is absurd to\n\t\t\t\t\tinquire how Being as substance is many, and not how qualities or\n\t\t\t\t\tquantities are many.Surely the indeterminate dyad or the Great and Small is no reason\n\t\t\t\t\twhy there should be two whites or many colors or flavors or shapes;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor then these too would be numbers and\n\t\t\t\t\tunits. But if the Platonists had pursued this inquiry, they would have\n\t\t\t\t\tperceived the cause of plurality in substances as well; for the\n\t\t\t\t\tcause is the same, or analogous. This deviation of theirs was the reason why in seeking the opposite\n\t\t\t\t\tof Being and unity, from which in combination with Being and unity\n\t\t\t\t\texisting things are derived, they posited the relative (i.e. the\n\t\t\t\t\tunequal), which is neither the contrary nor the negation of Being and\n\t\t\t\t\tunity, but is a single characteristic of existing things, just like\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance or quality. They should have investigated this question\n\t\t\t\t\talso; how it is that relations are many, and not one.As it is, they inquire how it\n\t\t\t\t\tis that there are many units besides the primary unity, but not how\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are many unequal things besides the Unequal. Yet they employ in\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir arguments and speak of Great and Small, Many and Few (of which\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers are composed), Long and Short (of which the line is composed),\n\t\t\t\t\tBroad and Narrow (of which the plane is composed), Deep and Shallow\n\t\t\t\t\t(of which solids are composed); and they mention still further kinds\n\t\t\t\t\tof relation. Now what is the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\tplurality in these relations? We must, then, as I say,\n\t\t\t\t\tpresuppose in the case of each thing that which is it potentially. The\n\t\t\t\t\tauthor of\n\t\t\t\t\tthis theory further explained what it is that is potentially a\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular thing or substance, but is not per se\n\t\t\t\t\texistentthat it is the relative (he might as well have said\n\t\t\t\t\t\"quality\"); which is neither potentially unity or Being, nor a\n\t\t\t\t\tnegation of unity or Being,but just a particular kind of Being. And it was still more necessary, as we have\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat, if he was inquiring how it is that things are many, he should\n\t\t\t\t\tnot confine his inquiry to things in the same category, and ask how it\n\t\t\t\t\tis that substances or qualities are many, but that he should ask how\n\t\t\t\t\tit is that things in general are many; for some things are substances,\n\t\t\t\t\tsome affections, and some relations.Now in the case of the other categories there\n\t\t\t\t\tis an additional difficulty in discovering how they are many. For it\n\t\t\t\t\tmay be said that since they are not separable, it is because the\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstrate becomes or is many that qualities and quantities are many;\n\t\t\t\t\tyet there must be some matter for each class of entities, only it\n\t\t\t\t\tcannot be separable from substances.In the case of particular substances, however,\n\t\t\t\t\tit is explicable how the particular thing can be many, if we do not\n\t\t\t\t\tregard a thing both as a particular substance and as a certain\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacteristic. The real difficulty which arises from\n\t\t\t\t\tthese considerations is how substances are actually many and not\n\t\t\t\t\tone.Again, even if a particular\n\t\t\t\t\tthing and a quantity are not the same, it is not explained how and why\n\t\t\t\t\texisting things are many, but only how quantities are many;for all number denotes\n\t\t\t\t\tquantity, and the unit, if it does not mean a measure, means that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is quantitatively indivisible. If, then, quantity and substance\n\t\t\t\t\tare different, it is not explained whence or how substance is many;\n\t\t\t\t\tbut if they are the same, he who holds\n\t\t\t\t\tthis has to face many logical contradictions.One might fasten also upon the question with\n\t\t\t\t\trespect to numbers, whence we should derive the belief that they\n\t\t\t\t\texist.For one who posits Ideas, numbers supply a kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tcause for existing things; that is if each of the numbers is a kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tIdea, and the Idea is, in some way or other, the cause of existence\n\t\t\t\t\tfor other things; for let us grant them this assumption.But as for him who does not\n\t\t\t\t\thold this belief, because he can see the difficulties inherent in the\n\t\t\t\t\tIdeal theory (and so has not this reason for positing numbers), and\n\t\t\t\t\tyet posits mathematical number, what grounds have we for believing his\n\t\t\t\t\tstatement that there is a number of this kind, and what good is this\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber to other things? He who maintains its existence does not claim\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is the cause of anything, but regards it as an independent\n\t\t\t\t\tentity; nor can we observe it to be the cause of anything; for the\n\t\t\t\t\ttheorems of the arithmeticians will all apply equally well to sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, as we have said. Those,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen, who posit the Ideas and identify them with numbers, by their\n\t\t\t\t\tassumption (in accordance with their method of abstracting each\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral term from its several concrete examples) that every general\n\t\t\t\t\tterm is a unity, make some attempt to explain why number exists. Since, however,\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir arguments are neither necessarily true nor indeed\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible,there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tjustification on this ground for maintaining the existence of\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber.The\n\t\t\t\t\tPythagoreans, on the other hand, observing that many attributes of\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers apply to sensible bodies, assumed that real things are\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers; not that numbers exist separately, but that real things are\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of numbers. But why? Because the attributes of numbers\n\t\t\t\t\tare to be found in a musical scale, in the heavens, and in many other\n\t\t\t\t\tconnections. As for those who hold that\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical number alone exists, they cannot allege anything of this kind consistently with their hypotheses; what they\n\t\t\t\t\tdid say was that the sciences could not have sensible things as their\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects. But we maintain that they can; as we have said before. And\n\t\t\t\t\tclearly the objects of mathematics do not exist in separation; for if\n\t\t\t\t\tthey did their attributes would not be present in corporeal\n\t\t\t\t\tthings.Thus in this\n\t\t\t\t\trespect the Pythagoreans are immune from criticism; but in so far as\n\t\t\t\t\tthey construct natural bodies, which have lightness and weight, out of\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers which have no weight or lightness, they appear to be treating\n\t\t\t\t\tof another universe and other bodies, not of sensible ones.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut those who treat number as separable assume that it exists and is\n\t\t\t\t\tseparable because the axioms will not apply to sensible objects;\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas the statements of mathematics are true and appeal to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsoul.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe same applies to mathematical extended\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnitudes. It is clear, then, both that the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary theory can make\n\t\t\t\t\tout a case for the contrary view, and that those who hold this theory\n\t\t\t\t\tmust find a solution for the difficulty which was recently raisedwhy\n\t\t\t\t\tit is that while numbers are in no way present in sensible things,\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir attributes are present in sensible things.There are some who think that, because the point is the limit\n\t\t\t\t\tand extreme of the line, and the line of the plane, and the plane of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe solid, there must be entities of this kind.We must, then, examine this argument\n\t\t\t\t\talso, and see whether it is not exceptionally weak. For (1.) extremes\n\t\t\t\t\tare not substances; rather all such things are merely limits. Even\n\t\t\t\t\twalking, and motion in general, has some limit; so on the view which\n\t\t\t\t\twe are criticizing this will be an individual thing, and a kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance. But this is absurd. And moreover (2.) even if they are\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances, they will all be substances of particular sensible things,\n\t\t\t\t\tsince it was to these that the argument applied. Why, then, should\n\t\t\t\t\tthey be separable? Again, we may, if we are not unduly\n\t\t\t\t\tacquiescent, further object with regard to all number and mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects that they contribute nothing to each other, the prior to the\n\t\t\t\t\tposterior. For if number does not exist, none the less spatial\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnitudes will exist for those who maintain that only the objects of\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematics exist; and if the latter do not exist, the soul and\n\t\t\t\t\tsensible bodies will exist. But it does not appear, to judge from the\n\t\t\t\t\tobserved facts, that the natural system lacks cohesion,like a poorly constructed drama.\n\t\t\t\t\tThose who\n\t\t\t\t\tposit the Ideas escape this difficulty, because they construct spatial\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnitudes out of matter and a number2 in the case of\n\t\t\t\t\tlines, and 3, presumably, in that of planes, and 4 in that of solids;\n\t\t\t\t\tor out of other numbers, for it makes no difference.But are we to regard these\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnitudes as Ideas, or what is their mode of existence? and what\n\t\t\t\t\tcontribution do they make to reality? They contribute nothing; just as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe objects of mathematics contribute nothing. Moreover, no\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical theorem applies to them, unless one chooses to interfere\n\t\t\t\t\twith the principles of mathematics and invent peculiar theories of one's own. But it is not difficult to take any\n\t\t\t\t\tchance hypotheses and enlarge upon them and draw out a long string of\n\t\t\t\t\tconclusions. These thinkers, then, are quite wrong\n\t\t\t\t\tin thus striving to connect the objects of mathematics with the Ideas.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut those who first recognized two kinds of number, the Ideal and the\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical as well, neither have explained nor can explain in any\n\t\t\t\t\tway how mathematical number will exist and of what it will be\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed; for they make it intermediate between Ideal and sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber.For if it is\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of the Great and Small, it will be the same as the former,\n\t\t\t\t\ti.e. Ideal, number. But of what other Great and Small can it be\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposed? for Plato makes spatial magnitudes out of a Great and\n\t\t\t\t\tSmall.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd if he speaks of some other component, he will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe maintaining too many elements; while if some one thing is the first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciple of each kind of number, unity will be something common to\n\t\t\t\t\tthese several kinds.We\n\t\t\t\t\tmust inquire how it is that unity is these many things, when at the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame time number, according to him, cannot be derived otherwise than\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom unity and an indeterminate dyad.All these views\n\t\t\t\t\tare irrational; they conflict both with one another and with sound\n\t\t\t\t\tlogic, and it seems that in them we have a case of Simonides' \"long\n\t\t\t\t\tstory\"; for men\n\t\t\t\t\thave recourse to the \"long story,\" such as slaves tell, when they have\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing satisfactory to say.The very elements too, the Great and Small,\n\t\t\t\t\tseem to protest at being dragged in; for they cannot possibly generate\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers except rising powers of 2.It\n\t\t\t\t\tis absurd also, or rather it is one of the impossibilities of this\n\t\t\t\t\ttheory, to introduce generation of things which are eternal.There is no reason to doubt\n\t\t\t\t\twhether the Pythagoreans do or do not introduce it; for they clearly\n\t\t\t\t\tstate that when the One had been constitutedwhether out of\n\t\t\t\t\tplanes or superficies or seed or out of something that they cannot\n\t\t\t\t\texplainimmediately the nearest part of the Infinite began\n\t\t\t\t\tto be drawn in and limited by the Limit. However, since they are here\n\t\t\t\t\texplaining the construction of the universe and meaning to speak in\n\t\t\t\t\tterms of physics, although we may somewhat criticize their physical\n\t\t\t\t\ttheories,it is only\n\t\t\t\t\tfair to exempt them from the present inquiry; for it is the first\n\t\t\t\t\tprinciples in unchangeable things that we are investigating, and\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore we have to consider the generation of this kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers. They say that there is no generation of odd\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers, which clearly implies that there is generation of\n\t\t\t\t\teven ones; and some hold that the even is constructed first out of\n\t\t\t\t\tunequalsthe Great and Smallwhen they are\n\t\t\t\t\tequalized. Therefore the\n\t\t\t\t\tinequality must apply to them before they are equalized. If they had\n\t\t\t\t\talways been equalized they would not have been unequal before; for\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is nothing prior to that which has always been.Hence evidently it is not for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of a logical theory that they introduce the generation of\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers A difficulty, and a discredit\n\t\t\t\t\tto those who make light of the difficulty, arises out of the question\n\t\t\t\t\thow the elements and first principles are related to the the Good and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Beautiful. The difficulty is this: whether any of the elements is\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch as we mean when we speak\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Good or the Supreme Good, or whether on the contrary these are\n\t\t\t\t\tlater in generation than the elements.It would seem that there is an agreement\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween the mythologists and some present-day thinkers,\n\t\t\t\t\twho deny that there is such an element, and say that it was only after\n\t\t\t\t\tsome evolution in the natural order of things that both the Good and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Beautiful appeared. They do this to avoid a real difficulty which\n\t\t\t\t\tconfronts those who hold, as some do, that unity is a first principle.\n\t\t\t\t\t This difficulty arises not from ascribing\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness to the first principle as an attribute, but from treating\n\t\t\t\t\tunity as a principle, and a principle in the sense of an element, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthen deriving number from unity. The early poets agree with this view\n\t\t\t\t\tin so far as they assert that it was not the original\n\t\t\t\t\tforcessuch as Night, Heaven, Chaos or Oceanbut\n\t\t\t\t\tZeus who was king and ruler.It was, however, on the ground of the changing of the rulers of the\n\t\t\t\t\tworld that the poets were led to state these theories; because those\n\t\t\t\t\tof them who compromise by not describing everything in mythological\n\t\t\t\t\tlanguagee.g. Pherecydes and\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain othersmake the primary generator the Supreme Good;\n\t\t\t\t\tand so do the Magi, and some of the later\n\t\t\t\t\tphilosophers such as Empedocles and Anaxagoras: the one making Love an\n\t\t\t\t\telement, and the other making\n\t\t\t\t\tMind a first principle. And of those who hold that\n\t\t\t\t\tunchangeable substances exist, some identify absolute unity with absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tgoodness; but they considered that the essence of goodness was\n\t\t\t\t\tprimarily unity.This, then, is the\n\t\t\t\t\tproblem: which of these two views we should hold.Now it is remarkable if that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tprimary and eternal and supremely self-sufficient does not possess\n\t\t\t\t\tthis very quality, viz. self-sufficiency and immunity, in a primary\n\t\t\t\t\tdegree and as something good. Moreover, it is imperishable and\n\t\t\t\t\tself-sufficient for no other reason than because it is good.Hence it is probably true to say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the first principle is of this nature. But to say that this principle is unity, or\n\t\t\t\t\tif not that, that it is an element, and an element of numbers, is\n\t\t\t\t\timpossible; for this involves a serious difficulty, to avoid which\n\t\t\t\t\tsome thinkers have abandoned the theory (viz.\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who agree that unity is a first principle and element, but of\n\t\t\t\t\t number). For on this view all units\n\t\t\t\t\tbecome identical with some good, and we get a great abundance of\n\t\t\t\t\tgoods. Further, if the Forms are\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers, all Forms become identical with some good. Again, let us\n\t\t\t\t\tassume that there are Ideas of anything that we choose. If there are\n\t\t\t\t\tIdeas only of goods, the Ideas will not be substances; and if there are Ideas of\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstances also, all animals and plants, and all things that\n\t\t\t\t\tparticipate in the Ideas, will be goods. Not only do these absurdities follow, but it also follows that the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary element, whether it is plurality or the unequal, i.e. the\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat and Small, is absolute badness. Hence one thinker avoided\n\t\t\t\t\tassociating the Good with unity, on the ground that since generation\n\t\t\t\t\tproceeds from contraries, the nature of plurality would then\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessarily be bad.Others hold that inequality is the nature of the\n\t\t\t\t\tbad. It follows, then, that all things partake of the Bad except\n\t\t\t\t\toneabsolute unity; and that numbers partake of it in a more\n\t\t\t\t\tunmitigated form than do spatial magnitudes; and that the Bad is\n\t\t\t\t\tthe province for the activity of the Good, and partakes of and tends\n\t\t\t\t\ttowards that which is destructive of the Good; for a contrary is\n\t\t\t\t\tdestructive of its contrary.And if, as we said,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe matter of each thing is that which is it\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentiallye.g., the matter of actual fire is that which is\n\t\t\t\t\tpotentially firethen the Bad will be simply the potentially\n\t\t\t\t\tGood.Thus all these objections\n\t\t\t\t\tfollow because (1.) they make every principle an element; (2.) they\n\t\t\t\t\tmake contraries principles; (3.) they make unity a principle; and (4.)\n\t\t\t\t\tthey make numbers the primary substances, and separable, and\n\t\t\t\t\tForms. If, then, it is impossible both not to\n\t\t\t\t\tinclude the Good among the first principles, and to include it in this\n\t\t\t\t\tway, it is clear that the first principles are not being rightly\n\t\t\t\t\trepresented, nor are the primary substances. Nor is a certain\n\t\t\t\t\tthinker\n\t\t\t\t\tright in his assumption when he likens the principles of the universe\n\t\t\t\t\tto that of animals and plants, on the ground that the more perfect\n\t\t\t\t\tforms are always produced from those which are indeterminate and\n\t\t\t\t\timperfect, and is led by this to assert that this is true also of the\n\t\t\t\t\tultimate principles; so that not even unity itself is a real\n\t\t\t\t\tthing. He\n\t\t\t\t\tis wrong; for even in the natural world the principles from which\n\t\t\t\t\tthese things are derived are perfect and completefor it is\n\t\t\t\t\tman that begets man; the seed does not come first. It is absurd also to generate space\n\t\t\t\t\tsimultaneously with the mathematical solids (for space is peculiar to\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular things, which is why they are separable in space, whereas\n\t\t\t\t\tthe objects of mathematics have no position)and to say that they must be somewhere,\n\t\t\t\t\tand yet not explain what their spatial position is. Those\n\t\t\t\t\twho assert that reality is derived from elements, and that numbers are\n\t\t\t\t\tthe primary realities, ought to have first distinguished the senses in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich one thing is derived from another, and then explained in what\n\t\t\t\t\tway number is derived from the first principles. Is it by mixture? But\n\t\t\t\t\t(a) not everything admits of mixture; (b) the result of mixture is something\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent; and unity will not be separable, nor will it be a distinct entity, as\n\t\t\t\t\tthey intend it to be.Is it\n\t\t\t\t\tby composition, as we hold of the syllable? But (a) this necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\timplies position; (b) in thinking of unity and plurality we shall\n\t\t\t\t\tthink of them separately. This, then, is what number will\n\t\t\t\t\tbea unit  plurality, or unity\n\t\t\t\t\t the Unequal.And since\n\t\t\t\t\ta thing is derived from elements either as inherent or as not inherent\n\t\t\t\t\tin it, in which way is number so derived? Derivation from inherent\n\t\t\t\t\telements is only possible for things which admit of generation. Is it derived as from seed?But nothing can be emitted from that\n\t\t\t\t\twhich is indivisible. Is it derived from a contrary which does not persist? But\n\t\t\t\t\tall things which derive their being in this way derive it also from\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething else which does persist. Since, therefore, one thinker regards unity as\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary to plurality, and another (treating it as the\n\t\t\t\t\tEqual) as contrary to the Unequal, number must be derived as from\n\t\t\t\t\tcontraries.Hence\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is something else which persists from which, together with one\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary, number is or has been derived.Further, why on earth is it that whereas all other things which are\n\t\t\t\t\tderived from contraries or have contraries perish, even if the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrary is exhausted in producing them, number does not perish? Of this no explanation\n\t\t\t\t\tis given; yet whether it is inherent or not, a contrary is\n\t\t\t\t\tdestructive; e.g., Strife destroys the mixture. It should not, however, do this;\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the mixture is not its contrary. Nor is it in any\n\t\t\t\t\tway defined in which sense numbers are the causes of substances and of\n\t\t\t\t\tBeing; whether as bounds, e.g. as points are the bounds of\n\t\t\t\t\tspatial magnitudes, and as\n\t\t\t\t\tEurytus determined which number belongs to which\n\t\t\t\t\tthinge.g. this number to man, and this to\n\t\t\t\t\thorseby using pebbles to copy the shape of natural objects,\n\t\t\t\t\tlike those who arrange numbers in the form of geometrical figures, the\n\t\t\t\t\ttriangle and the square. Or is it because harmony is a ratio of\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers, and so too is man and everything else? But in what sense are\n\t\t\t\t\tattributeswhite, and sweet, and hotnumbers? And clearly\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers are not the essence of things, nor are they causes of the\n\t\t\t\t\tform; for the ratio is the essence, and number is matter.E.g. the essence of flesh or bone is number\n\t\t\t\t\tonly in the sense that it is three parts of fire and two of\n\t\t\t\t\tearth.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd the number,whatever it\n\t\t\t\t\tis, is always a number of something; of particles of fire or earth, or\n\t\t\t\t\tof units. But the essence is the proportion of one quantity to another\n\t\t\t\t\tin the mixture; i.e. no longer a number, but a ratio of the mixture of\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers, either of corporeal particles or of any other kind. Thus\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber is not an efficient causeneither number in general,\n\t\t\t\t\tnor that which consists of abstract unitsnor is it the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter, nor the formula or form of things. Nor again is it a final\n\t\t\t\t\tcause. The question might also be raised as to what\n\t\t\t\t\tthe good is which things derive from numbers because their mixture can\n\t\t\t\t\tbe expressed by a number, either one which is easily calculable, or\n\t\t\t\t\tan odd number. For in point of fact\n\t\t\t\t\thoney-water is no more wholesome if it is mixed in the proportion\n\t\t\t\t\t\"three times three\"; it would be more beneficial mixed in no\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular proportion, provided that it be diluted, than mixed in an\n\t\t\t\t\tarithmetical proportion, but strong.Again, the ratios of mixtures are expressed by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe relation of numbers, and not simply by numbers; e.g., it is 3 : 2,\n\t\t\t\t\tnot 3 X 2; for in products of multiplication the units must belong\n\t\t\t\t\tto the same genus. Thus the product of 1 x 2 x 3 must be measurable by\n\t\t\t\t\t1, and the product of 4 X 5 x 7 by 4. Therefore all products which\n\t\t\t\t\tcontain the same factor must be measurable by that factor. Hence the\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of fire cannot be 2 X 5 X 3 X 7 if the number of water is 2 x\n\t\t\t\t\t3.\n\t\t\t\t\t If all things must share in number, it\n\t\t\t\t\tmust follow that many things are the same; i.e., that the same number\n\t\t\t\t\tbelongs both to this thing and to something else. Is number, then, a\n\t\t\t\t\tcause; i.e., is it because of number that the object exists? Or is\n\t\t\t\t\tthis not conclusive? E.g., there is a certain number of the sun's\n\t\t\t\t\tmotions, and again of the moon's, and indeed\n\t\t\t\t\tof the life and maturity of every animate thing. What reason, then, is\n\t\t\t\t\tthere why some of these numbers should not be squares and others\n\t\t\t\t\tcubes, some equal and others double?There is no reason; all things must fall\n\t\t\t\t\twithin this range of numbers if, as was assumed, all things share in\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber, and different things may fall under the same number. Hence if\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain things happened to have the same number, on the Pythagorean\n\t\t\t\t\tview they would be the same as one another, because they would have\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same form of number; e.g., sun and moon would be the same. But why\n\t\t\t\t\tare these numbers causes? There are seven vowels,\n\t\t\t\t\tseven strings to the scale, seven Pleiads; most animals (though not\n\t\t\t\t\tall) lose their teeth in the seventh year; and there were\n\t\t\t\t\tseven heroes who attacked . Is it, then, because the number 7 is such as it\n\t\t\t\t\tis that there were seven heroes, or that the Pleiads consist of seven\n\t\t\t\t\tstars? Surely there were seven heroes because of the seven gates, or\n\t\t\t\t\tfor some other reason, and the Pleiads are seven because we count them\n\t\t\t\t\tso; just as we count the Bear as 12, whereas others count more stars\n\t\t\t\t\tin both. Indeed, they assert also that  and  are concords, and that because there are three concords, there\n\t\t\t\t\tare three double consonants. They ignore the fact that there might be\n\t\t\t\t\tthousands of double consonantsbecause there might be one\n\t\t\t\t\tsymbol for . But if they say that\n\t\t\t\t\teach of these letters is double any of the others, whereas no other\n\t\t\t\t\tis, and that the reason is\n\t\t\t\t\tthat there are three regions of the mouth, and that one\n\t\t\t\t\tconsonant is combined with  in each\n\t\t\t\t\tregion, it is for this reason that there are only three double\n\t\t\t\t\tconsonants, and not because there are three concordsbecause\n\t\t\t\t\tthere are really more than three; but there cannot be more than three\n\t\t\t\t\tdouble consonants. Thus these thinkers are like the\n\t\t\t\t\tancient Homeric scholars, who see minor similarities but overlook\n\t\t\t\t\timportant ones.Some say that there are\n\t\t\t\t\tmany correspondences of this kind; e.g., the middle notes of the octave are respectively 8 and 9,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the epic hexameter has seventeen syllables, which equals the sum\n\t\t\t\t\tof these two; and the line scans in the first half\n\t\t\t\t\twith nine syllables, and in the second with eight. And they point out that the\n\t\t\t\t\tinterval from  to  in the alphabet is equal to that from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe lowest note of a flute to the highest, whose number is equal to\n\t\t\t\t\tthat of the whole system of the universe. We\n\t\t\t\t\tmust realize that no one would find any difficulty either in\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscovering or in stating such correspondences as these in the realm\n\t\t\t\t\tof eternal things, since they occur even among perishable\n\t\t\t\t\tthings. As for the celebrated characteristics of\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber, and their contraries, and in general the mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\tproperties, in the sense that some describe them and make them out to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe causes of the natural world, it would seem that if we examine them\n\t\t\t\t\talong these lines, they disappear; for not one of them is a cause in\n\t\t\t\t\tany of the senses which we distinguished with until respect to the\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst Principles.\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a sense,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, in which these thinkers make it clear that goodness is\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicable of numbers, and that the odd, the straight, the\n\t\t\t\t\tequal-by-equal, and the powers of\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain numbers, belong to the series of the Beautiful. For the seasons are connected with a\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain kind of number; and the other examples which they adduce from mathematical\n\t\t\t\t\ttheorems all have the same force.Hence they would seem to be mere coincidences,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor they are accidental; but all the examples are appropriate to each\n\t\t\t\t\tother, and they are one by analogy. For there is analogy between all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe categories of Beingas \"straight\" is in\n\t\t\t\t\tlength,so is \"level\"\n\t\t\t\t\tin breadth, perhaps \"odd\" in number, and \"white\" in color. Again, it is not the Ideal numbers that are the causes of harmonic\n\t\t\t\t\trelations, etc. (for Ideal numbers, even when they are equal, differ\n\t\t\t\t\tin kind, since their units also differ in kind); so on this ground at least we need not posit\n\t\t\t\t\tForms. Such, then, are the consequences of the\n\t\t\t\t\ttheory, and even more might be adduced. But the mere fact that the\n\t\t\t\t\tPlatonists find so much trouble with regard to the generation of Ideal\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers, and can in no way build up a system, would seem to be a proof\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the objects of mathematics are not separable from sensible\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, as some maintain, and that the first principles are not those\n\t\t\t\t\twhich these thinkers assume."}}]}}}}
