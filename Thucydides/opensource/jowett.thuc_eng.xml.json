It may be said of his descriptions generally, as of most early descriptions, that\n\t\t\t\tthey are graphic rather than accurate. When we try to reproduce them in the mind something\n\t\t\t\tis wanting. For example, we do not gather from his narrative where the Euryelus was situated\n\t\t\t\tby which the Athenians, and also Gylippus, ascended the heights of Epipolae (; , ), or how the Syracusan defences lay after the completion of the third\n\t\t\t\tcounter-wall (), or, without some consideration, how the\n\t\t\t\tdolphins were placed for the protection of the Athenian ships in the great Syracusan harbour\n\t\t\t\t(). The topography of battles is often imperfect, and\n\t\t\t\tsometimes leads to a difficulty in the explanation of them. The narrative of the battle of\n\t\t\t\tAmphipolis leads to the inference (see Arnold's Appendix) that the city was not at the top\n\t\t\t\tbut on the slope of the hill which Cleon ascended with his army, but this can only be\n\t\t\t\tinferred with some uncertainty and is not definitely expressed. Perhaps without maps and\n\t\t\t\tplans a better delineation was impossible. The narrative of the second sea-fight in the\n\t\t\t\tCrisaean gulf (ii. go f.) is incoherent: for we are not told what happened to that portion\n\t\t\t\tof the Peloponnesian fleet which was originally victorious. The manner of the attack which\n\t\t\t\tended in the capture of the first Syracusan counter-wall () is not fully described and can only be inferred; the 'Argive hoplites'\n\t\t\t\twho were killed in the Syracusan out-works after the capture of the stockade must have\n\t\t\t\tjoined the attacking party from one of the two other divisions of the army. Once more, in\n\t\t\t\tthe calculation of distances the eye or the information of the writer was frequently at\n\t\t\t\tfault. For examples see below."}, "There has been a good deal of controversy on this subject. Even into geography the spirit of\n\t\t\t\tparty may find a way. Some commentators have been desirous of maintaining the credit of\n\t\t\t\ttheir author, like Dr. Arnold, who was of opinion that 'when Geographers who are also\n\t\t\t\tScholars visit the places of which Thucydides speaks personally, most of the difficulties in\n\t\t\t\this descriptions will vanish.' That remark of course supposes that Thucydides, rightly\n\t\t\t\tunderstood, is generally or always in the right. We may imagine the writer of it to feel\n\t\t\t\twhat he does not say: 'The most accurate and trustworthy of historians can hardly be\n\t\t\t\timagined to be ignorant as a schoolboy of geography.' And certainly, in his account of Pylos\n\t\t\t\tand Sphacteria, Dr. Arnold is ready, in a figure, to work a miracle in order to save the\n\t\t\t\treputation of Thucydides.

For the knowledge of geography is always growing\n\t\t\t\twith time, while history fades into the distance. The materials of the one are increasing,\n\t\t\t\twhile those of the other are diminishing. The credibility of an author's geography is not\n\t\t\t\ttherefore to be judged of by the credibility of his history, because in the\n\t\t\t\tone far more than in the other he is dependent on the conditions of his age."}, "In this short note it is not intended to enter into the discussion of particular passages,\n\t\t\t\tbut rather to urge two general principles: (i) that geographical accuracy is not to be\n\t\t\t\texpected from a writer of the age of Thucydides: (2) that the number of his inaccuracies\n\t\t\t\tshow them to be attributable rather to his ignorance, than to the ignorance of later\n\t\t\t\twriters, or of ourselves.", {"bibl": [{"@n": "Thuc. 2.97", "#text": "2.97"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 4.36", "#text": "4.36"}], "#text": "To attempt to reconcile the geography of Thucydides with facts may be the same error in kind,\n\t\t\t\tthough not in degree, as to try and adapt the drive of Telemachus between Pylos and Sparta\n\t\t\t\tto the present condition of the country, or to seek on the sea-shore of Ithaca for the cave\n\t\t\t\tby which Odysseus was deposited. As the more familiar features of a scene are likely to be\n\t\t\t\treproduced in the creations of the poet, so the ancient historian will roughly guess\n\t\t\t\tdistances. But he may often make mistakes about a region with which he was unacquainted, and\n\t\t\t\the will not always be able to judge what amount of description is required in order to place\n\t\t\t\tbefore his readers a just conception of a place or of a battle. There were no surveys of\n\t\t\t\tcountries or measurements of distances in the age of Herodotus and Thucydides (except along\n\t\t\t\tthe course of great roads such as the Persian highways), but only the proverbially uncertain\n\t\t\t\tmeasure of a day's journey or of a day's sail (see Thuc. ,\n\t\t\t\tand Arnold's note).

I would have you know, that whereas other men fight with their neighbours about the lines of a frontier, for us, if we are conquered, there will be no more disputing about frontiers, but one fixed boundary, including our whole country, for the Athenians will come in and take by force all that we have.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSo much more dangerous are they than ordinary neighbours. And men who, like them, wantonly assail others, will not hesitate to attack him who remains quietly at home and only defends himself; but they are not so ready to overbear the adversary who goes out of his own country to meet them, and when there is an opportunity strikes first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe have proved this in our own dealings with the Athenians. Once, owing to our internal dissensions, they took possession of our land, but we overcame them at Coronea,  and gave Boeotia that complete security which has lasted to this day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemember the past: let the elder men among us emulate their own earlier deeds, and the younger who are the sons of those valiant fathers do their best not to tarnish the virtues of their race. Confident that the God whose temple they have impiously fortified and now occupy will be our champion, and relying on the sacrifices, which are favourable to us, let us advance to meet them. They may satisfy their greed by attacking those who do not defend themselves; but we will show them that from men whose generous spirit ever impels them to fight for the liberties of their country, and who will not see that of others unjustly enslaved,from such men they will not part without a battle.'"}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "93", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}], "note": {"@type": "margin", "@anchored": "yes", "hi": "The Boeotian army, numbering not less than eighteen thousand five hundred in all, the Theban division arranged twenty-five deep, appears over the crest of a hill."}, "pb": {"@n": "70"}, "#text": "With this exhortation Pagondas persuaded the Boeotians to march against the Athenians, and quickly moved his army forward (for the day was far advanced).

The spectacle of their numbers is terrible, their cries are intolerable, and the brandishing of their spears in the air has a menacing effect.

Meanwhile the democracy at Argos, fearing the Lacedaemonians, and again courting the Athenian alliance in which their hopes were centred, began building Long Walls to the sea, in order that if they were blockaded by land they might have the advantage, with Athenian help, of introducing provisions by water.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCertain other states in Peloponnesus were privy to this project.

They will probably feel that if they leave us to our fate, the trouble may reach themselves, and therefore they may be inclined in some way or other, secretly, if not openly, to assist us.

If all the Sicilian Greeks, or at least if we and as many as will join us, taking two months' provisions, would put out to sea with all our available ships and prepare to meet the Athenians at Tarentum and the promontory of Iapygia, thereby proving to them that before they fight for Sicily they must fight for the passage of the Ionian Sea, we  should strike a panic into them. They would then reflect that at Tarentum (which receives us), we, the advanced guard of Sicily, are among friends, and go forth from a friendly country, and that the sea is a large place not easy to traverse with so great an armament as theirs. They would know that after a long voyage their ships will be unable to keep in line, and coming up slowly and few at a time will be at our mercy. On the other hand, if they lighten their vessels and meet us in a compact body with the swifter part of their fleet, they may have to use oars, and then we shall attack them when they are exhausted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOr if we prefer not to fight, we can retire again to Tarentum. Having come over with slender supplies and prepared for a naval engagement, they will not know what to do on these desolate coasts. If they remain they will find themselves blockaded; if they attempt to sail onwards they will cut themselves off from the rest of their armament, and will be discouraged; for they will be far from certain whether the cities of Italy and Sicily will receive them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn my opinion the anticipation of these difficulties will hamper them to such a degree, that they will never leave Corcyra. While they are holding consultations, and sending out spies to discover our number and exact position, they will find themselves driven into winter; or in dismay at the unexpected opposition, they may very likely break up the expedition; especially if, as I am informed, the most experienced of their generals has taken the command against his will, and would gladly make any considerable demonstration on our part an excuse for retreating. I am quite sure that rumour will exaggerate our strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe minds of men are apt to be swayed by what they hear; and they are most afraid of those who commence an attack, or who at any rate show to the aggressor betimes that he will meet with resistance; for then they reflect that the risk is equally divided. And so it will be with the Athenians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are now attacking us because they do not believe that we shall defend ourselves,  and in this opinion they are justified by our neglect to join with the Lacedaemonians in putting them down. But, if they see that they were mistaken, and that we boldly venture, they will be more dismayed at our unexpected resistance than at our real power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTake my advice; if possible, resolve on this bold step, but if not, adopt other measures of defence as quickly as possible. Remember each and all of you that the true contempt of an invader is shown by deeds of valour in the field, and that meanwhile the greatest service which you can render to the state is to act as if you were in the presence of danger, considering that safety depends on anxious preparation.

He ordered provisions for five days, and took with him all the masons and carpenters in the army; also a supply of arrows and of the various implements which would be required for siege-works if he were victorious. About the first watch he, Eurymedon, and Menander led out the whole army and marched towards Epipolae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNicias was left in the Athenian fortifications. Reaching Epipolae at the Euryelus, where their first army had originally ascended, and advancing undiscovered by the garrison to the fort which the Syracusans had there erected, they took it and killed some of the guards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the greater number made good their escape and carried the news to the three fortified camps, one of the Syracusans, one of the other Sicilian Greeks, and one of the allies, which had been formed on Epipolae; they also gave the alarm to the six hundred who were an advanced guard stationed on this part of Epipolae. They hastened to meet the enemy, but Demosthenes and the Athenians came upon them and, in spite of  a vigorous resistance, drove them back.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Athenians immediately pressed forward; they were determined not to lose a moment or to slacken their onset until they had accomplished their purpose. Others captured the first part of the Syracusan counter-wall and, the guards taking to flight, began to drag off the battlements. Meanwhile the Syracusans, the allies, and Gylippus with his own troops, were hurrying from the outworks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe boldness of this night attack quite amazed them. They had not recovered from their terror when they met the Athenians, who were at first too strong for them and drove them back. But now the conquerors, in the confidence of victory, began to fall into disorder as they advanced;\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthey wanted to force their way as quickly as they could through all that part of the enemy which had not yet fought, and they were afraid that if they relaxed their efforts the Syracusans might rally.

The Athenians were looking about for each other; and every one who met them, though he might be a friend who had turned and fled, they imagined to be an enemy. They kept constantly asking the watchword (for there was no other mode of knowing one another), and thus they not only caused great confusion among themselves by all asking at once, but revealed the word to the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe watchword of the Syracusans was not so liable to be discovered, because being victorious they kept together and were more easily recognized.

Most disastrous of all were the mistakes caused by the sound of the Paean, which, the same being heard in both armies, was a great source of perplexity.

The man who dealt the blow escaped; his accomplice, an Argive, was seized and put to the torture by order of the Four Hundred, but did not disclose any name or say who had instigated the deed. All he would confess was that a number of persons used to assemble at the house of the commander of the frontier guard, and in other houses.

The hoplites who were at work on the fortification of Eetionea in the Piraeus, among whom was Aristocrates with his own tribe, which, as taxiarch, he commanded, seized Alexicles, an oligarchical general who had been most concerned with the clubs, and shut him up in a house. Others joined in the act, including one Hermon, who commanded the Peripoli stationed at Munychia;\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tabove all, the rank and file of the hoplites heartily approved.

Theramenes protested, and offered to go with them at once and rescue Alexicles. So, taking one of the generals who was of his own faction, he went down to the Piraeus. Aristarchus and certain young knights came also to the scene of action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat and bewildering was the tumult, for in the city the people fancied that the Piraeus was in the hands of the insurgents, and that their prisoner had been killed, and the inhabitants of the Piraeus that they were on the point of being attacked from the city. The elder men with difficulty restrained the citizens, who were running up and down and flying to arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThucydides of Pharsalus, the proxenus of Athens in that city, happening to be on the spot, kept throwing himself in every man's way and loudly entreating the people, when the enemy was lying in wait so near, not to destroy their country. At length they were pacified, and refrained from laying hands on one another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTheramenes, who was himself a general, came to the Piraeus, and in an angry voice pretended to rate the soldiers, while Aristarchus and the party opposed to the people were furious. No effect was produced on the mass of the hoplites, who were for going to work at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey began asking Theramenes if he thought that the fort was being built to any good end, and whether it would not be better demolished. He answered that, if they thought so, he thought so too. And immediately the hoplites and a crowd of men from the Piraeus got on the walls and began to pull them down. The cry addressed to the people was,' Whoever wishes the Five Thousand to rule and not the Four Hundred, let him come and help us.'\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFor they still veiled their real minds under the name of the Five Thousand, and did not venture to say outright 'Whoever wishes the people to rule': they feared that the Five Thousand might actually exist, and that a man speaking in ignorance to his neighbour might get into trouble.
