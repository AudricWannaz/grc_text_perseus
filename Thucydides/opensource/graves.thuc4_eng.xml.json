According to Plutarch ( ch. 7) it was from personal enmity to Nicias that Cleon persuaded the assembly to reject the truce, . Thucydides says nothing of the efforts of Nicias on this occasion, but he relates that in   422 he was most eager for peace, from his anxiety to preserve his own good fortune and name as a safe and successful general (). The impression which we form of his character is that he was a brave and careful commander when actually in the field, but disposed to magnify dangers and difficulties, and deficient in confidence and in a spirit of enterprise.
