The clause which is repeated here from the previous treaty, empowering the two contracting parties, of themselves and with out the consent of their allies, to add or take away from either treaty, naturally created a panic among the Peloponnesians (ch. 29, 15), whose independence was threatened by it.

It may mean, as Jowett suggests, that in some cases one part of the line was deepened at the expense of another, and the rear rank of one   posted behind another. Or possibly the ranks behind the first did not invariably contain four men. Thus an arrangement of 4, 3, 4 etc. would give 9 rows amounting to 32 men in all. But we must remember that Thucydides is not so much discussing the order of the Spartan soldiers, as furnishing an estimate of their numbers. He could not do this exactly, but he guarantees three things, the number of , viz. 112; the number of men, 448, in the front rank; and the average () depth, viz. 8. Now, if the number of men in each  was the same, we have not merely an approximate calculation, but an exact one, the very thing which Thucydides disclaims. May it not then have been the case that, in one or more of the , the  consisted of a number more or less than the standard 32? This would be a part of the system of secrecy (); and if it was privately managed by the military authorities we can see at once how the total number was kept dark (). According to the text this arrangement was left to the respective ; but it may be that the clause  is spurious, as Dobree suspected. The  or section, which was the unit of the Spartan army, undoubtedly varied in size at different periods; and may possibly have varied in different  or regiments at the same period.\nThis explanation seems not unreasonable: for if Thucydides had been sure of the number of men in each , why did he not state it, instead of only giving the number in the front rank?"}, {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "e)pi\\ pa=n"}, "bibl": [{"@n": "Thuc. 2. 51", "#text": "ii. 51"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 7. 79", "#text": "vii. 79"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 4. 93", "#text": "iv. 93"}], "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "toiou=ton h)=n e)pi\\ pa=n th\\n i)de/an"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)pi/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ou)k e)p) o)li/gwn a)spi/dwn"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)p) a)spi/das pe/nte kai\\ ei)/kosi *qhbai=oi e)ta/canto"}], "hi": {"@rend": "BOLD", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)pi\\ o)ktw/"}}, "#text": "generally; , 1,  (several examples in Kruger). eight deep.
