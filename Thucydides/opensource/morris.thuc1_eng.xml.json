The Attic deme Halimus, on the coast between Phalerum and Colias, in\n            the tribe of Leontis, is mentioned as the place of his birth. He tells us himself () that  his father's name was\n              Olorus; and his grave was undoubtedly in the family vault of\n            Cimon, near that of Elpinice, Cimon's sister, as Plutarch evidently saw it himself ( c. 4); and we may\n            accordingly assume it as certain that Olorus, the father of Thucydides was a near\n            kinsman of the Thracian prince of that name, whose daughter Hegesipyle was wife of the\n            great Miltiades (Hdt. vi. 39) and mother of Cimon; but the degree of relationship cannot\n            be more nearly defined. It is only Marcellinus ( 2) who gives to his mother\n            the name of the mother of Cimon, Hegesipyle; while Plutarch makes no such statement\n            where he could hardly have failed to do so, had he been aware of the fact; and we must,\n            therefore, be content with the knowledge that Cimon's grandfather Olorus was an ancestor\n              ( in Plutarch)from the similarity\n            of the name we may perhaps infer the grandfatherof the younger Olorus, the\n            father of the historian. That this Olorus was in full possession of\n            Athenian citizenship appears probable from the way in which his son designates himself\n              (), , for here, where he introduces himself as a , it is only as an Athenian citizen that his father could be\n            mentioned in the official style. Cimon no\n            doubt owed his wealth to the possessions of his mother's family on the Thracian coast,\n            which may have been  enlarged by the reduction of the neighbouring Thasos\n            (B.C. 463; i. 101.  3); and so Thucydides by the same relationship came into\n            the possession of his Thracian property, which consisted in goldmines near Scapte\n              Hyle. The assertion of Marcellinus ( 19), that\n            he married a rich woman of that region and so became possessed of the gold-mines, can\n            hardly be anything else than an idle guess."}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "le/getaipau/sasqai to\\n bi/on u(pe\\r\n              ta\\ penth/konta e)/th mh\\ plhrw/santa th=s suggrafh=s th\\n proqesmi/an"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "u(pe\\r ta\\\n              penth/konta e)/th"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)kmh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)kmh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)kmh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)kmh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ai)sqano/menos th=| h(liki/a| kai\\ prose/xwn th\\n gnw/mhn o(/pws a)kribe/s ti\n              ei)/setai"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)rca/menoscuggra/feineu)qu\\s kaqistame/nou kai\\ e)lpi/sas me/gan\n              te e)/sesqai kai\\ a)ciologw/taton tw=n progegenhme/nwn, tekmairo/menos kte(."}], "title": ["N.

We may conjecture that as boy and youth he looked up with reverence to\n            his noble kinsman, while he was in the full strength of his manhood and at the height of\n            his renown. If no other information were at hand, we might assume that when Cimon died\n            (B.C. 449) about sixty years of agegreater exactness is not\n            attainableThucydides was a young man between twenty and thirty. But as to the\n            time of his birth two statements are made. The one is in Marcellinus ( 34), of\n            extreme vagueness: (. The\n            other is due to Pamphila, who in the time of Nero made a great compilation of the\n            results of learning. A Gellius ( xv. 23) writes as follows:  Marcellinus's remark is plainly of no use for any\n            certain inference.  fifty years is one to go back to reach\n            the birth-year of Thucydides? It is hardly more than the result of an approximate\n            calculation, that Thucydides, who represents himself (i. 1.  1; ) as of competent judgment at the beginning of the\n            Peloponnesian war, and who must have died in any case after the end of it in B.C. 404,\n            must have been born before B.C. 454. One who wrote  clearly had himself no accurate knowledge. As to the\n            testimony of Pamphila, Diels indicates the proper way of looking at it in his  (Rhein. Mus. 31, p.\n            1-54). The dates given are no doubt taken from  Apollodorus, whose\n            chronological handbook had reached among the Greeks and Romans an almost canonical\n            acceptance. He adopted the method usual among Alexandrian scholars of determining the\n               or  of historical\n            personages by reference to any circumstance the date of which was known; and as this\n               was regularly assumed to be the 40th year,\n            probably on the basis of Pythagorean doctrines, it was easy from it to deduce the year\n            of birth. The  of Herodotus was placed by\n            Apollodorus probably at the time of his settlement at Thurii (B.C. 444), and accordingly\n            his birth would be in 484, and his age is given as 53 at the beginning of the\n            Peloponnesian war. The  of Thucydides may have been fixed by Apollodorus on the\n            ground of his own assertion (i. 1.  1; )\n            as to the maturity of his judgment at the beginning of the war. Diels therefore is right in saying that these considerations forbid us\n            to regard the dates assigned to Herodotus and Thucydides as based on anything stronger\n            than more or less probable hypothesis. If we cannot, however, find in the testimony of\n            Pamphila any positive basis for inferring the exact year of the birth of Thucydides, it\n            is nevertheless not without importance that in the exposition of his own words we reach\n            the same conclusion as Apollodorus. Thucydides says of himself () that he lived through the whole war , and it is clear that he did not make this remark at the close of\n            the twenty-seven years' war in order to set his readers at rest as to his mental power\n            and his capacity for observation the whole\n            work, with the completion of which he was then engaged, was ample evidence of\n            that,but to insist upon the circumstance which was much more likely to be\n            called in question, that nearly 30 years before he was possessed of all the qualities\n            requisite for the undertaking of so great a work with a full consciousness of its\n            importance; and so was justified in asserting that he had lived through the whole of  it with his power of observation and inquiry at their best. And it is just\n            this clearness of vision and maturity of judgment that Thucydides asserts of himself in\n            the opening words of his history: \n            It is plain that an author could not so write of himself unless he felt that at the time\n            of which he speaks he was able to exercise on important questions an independent\n            judgment founded on experience of life and a wide-reaching survey of the relations of\n            things. Of course it cannot be asserted that for this an age of 40 years is\n            indispensable; but still less can it be denied that such a maturity is in excellent\n            harmony with expressions of this character."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "12", "bibl": {"@n": "Thuc. 2.36.6", "#text": "ii.36.6"}, "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "oi( pate/res h(mw=n\n                kthsa/menoi pro\\s oi(=s e)de/canto o(/shn e)/xomen a)rxh\\n ou)k a)po/nws h(mi=n\n                toi=s nu=n proskate/lipon"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ta\\ de\\ plei/w\n                au)th=s au)toi\\ h(mei=s oi(/de oi( nu=n e)/ti o)/ntes ma/lista e)n th=|\n                kaqesthkui/a| h(liki/a| e)phuch/samen"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "kaqesthkui=a h(liki/a"}], "#text": "These are the two periods, each approximately of 20 years'\n              duration, which are distinguished in the funeral oration of Pericles, : , and .

How closely Thucydides\n            stood related to public life,  particularly in the second period, during\n            which his self-consciousness must have been fully awake, is a matter on which we have\n            not the slightest information. But in his history we find evidence, that, though his\n            family traditions must have inclined him to a moderate aristocracy, his full love and\n            admiration were given to the intellectual greatness of Pericles. If, as is probable, he\n            did not discharge any public duties under Pericles, he must have followed with his\n            liveliest sympathy the public administration of that great man and have rejoiced in the\n            results accomplished by his creative spirit; certainly he heard from his own lips those\n            speeches of which he has given us imperishable records, and in them trustworthy outlines\n            for forming a true picture of the mind of Pericles.

The story is found in Suidas, s.v.  and , in\n            Photius,  n. 60, and in the last part of the biography of\n            Marcellinus,  54; though only Suidas mentions Olympia as the scene of it. All\n            are derived from one and the same confused statement, the chief purpose of which was to\n            retain in remembrance the unusual expression in the assumed exclamation of Herodotus,\n               (or\n              . Even if we pay no regard to the chronological difficulties, which\n            cannot be surmounted unless we give up the testimony of Pamphila, it cannot be said that\n            Krger (, p. 30 ff.) has succeeded in giving\n            credibility to a story so late and so ill-attested. The recitation of Herodotus at\n            Olympia with all its embellishments in Lucian Dahlmann is\n            no doubt right in regarding as a fiction. If Herodotus recited portions of his work at\n            Athens, the most probable date is that furnished by Eusebius, Ol. 83. 3, B.C. 446; and that Thucydides may have been among\n            his listenersyet not as a boy of 10 years but as a young man of between 20\n            and 30 yearsis very credible. He may have then received an abiding impression\n            that an engaging narrative of entertaining events may be well enough adapted for a\n            single recitation before an assembled crowd, but not so a strict historical\n            representation, which is based on painstaking inquiry; and this may explain his somewhat\n            bitter assertion, , , and gives fuller meaning to the famous contrast of his own\n            history as a  to an  ()."}, {"pb": [{"@n": "8"}, {"@n": "9"}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "16", "hi": {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "Geschichte der Griechisch-Rmischen Philosophie"}, "#text": "See Brandis, , I. p.\n              233."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "17", "title": "Hist. of\n              Greece", "#text": "See Curtius, , II. p. 569."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "18", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)zh/lwse e)p' o)li/gon kai\\ ta\\s\n                *gorgi/ou tou= *leonti/nou parisw/seis kai\\ ta\\s a)ntiqe/seis tw=n o)noma/twn . . .\n                kai\\ me/ntoi kai\\ *prodi/kou tou= *kei/ou th\\n e)pi\\ toi=s o)no/masin\n              a)kribologi/an"}, "#text": "36, ."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "19", "title": "Epist.", "#text": "13, p. 919."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "20", "title": "De Gorgia Leontino", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ta\\ polla\\ kai\\ tw=n *gorgi/ou tou= *leonti/nou\n              mimou/menos"}, "#text": "See\n              Foss, , p. 23 ff.; Marcell.  36, 51,\n                ."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "21", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*sunagwgh\\ texnw=n"}, "#text": ", p. 53 ff."}], "bibl": [{"@n": "Thuc. 8.68.5", "#text": "viii.68.5"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 2.43.7", "#text": "ii.43.7"}], "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "to\\ megalo/gnwmon kai\\ th\\n o)fru=n"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "plei=stai a)napau=lai tw=n\n              po/nwn"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)gw=si kai\\ qusi/ais\n              diethsi/ois"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "th\\n th=s po/lews du/namin kaq'\n              h(me/ran e)/rgw| qea=sqai kai\\ e)rasta\\s gi/gnesqai au)th=s"}], "#text": "Whether the statement of Marcellinus,  22, that Thucydides studied philosophy\n            with Anaxagoras and rhetoric with Antiphon, rests upon authentic grounds, is of little\n            importance for us; these two men are so decidedly representatives of the new spirit,\n            which in both these departments made its way into Athens in their time  and\n            exercised a powerful influence on all who had any share of culture, that we should be\n            forced to assume for Thucydides a relation of this sort, even if there were no testimony\n            for it. Both lived at a time quite compatible with this assumption. Anaxagoras, who was\n            probably born in Ol. 70, about 500 B.C., sojourned permanently in Athens between 470 and 450 B.C., and lived on\n            terms of intimacy with Pericles: Antiphon, born about 485 B.C., and therefore some 10\n            years older than Thucydides, must have stood before his eyes as the pattern of manly and\n            energetic expression and may have been in nearer personal relations with\n            him; and accordingly the historian in the terms in which he describes the character of\n            Antiphon () has left a testimony to his merits in\n            which personal affection is unmistakable. An influence on the training of Thucydides of\n            a similar character may be presumed to have been exercised also by the Sophists\n            Protagoras, Prodicus, and Gorgias, who from the middle of the fifth century exerted\n            themselves for a longer or shorter time in Athens to spread abroad, by formal\n            instruction and by lectures, that adroitness of thought and speech which they had\n            acquired by manifold study and practice. We are told by Marcellinus, and it is in itself sufficiently credible, that\n            Thucydides appropriated and employed for his own style many of the results of the close\n            attention which these men paid to the forms of speech and their relation to thought.\n              Philostratus too says expressly that he borrowed  from Gorgias, who no doubt\n            visited Athens before the famous embassy of 427 B.C.; and Spengel proves by many\n            particular instances the influence exerted on the language of Thucydides by the theories\n            of Prodicus on synonymy. We must remember, besides, that the Athens in which Thucydides\n            passed his boyhood and youth was full of the noblest efforts and most glorious products\n            of poetry, sculpture, and architecture; that  he must have seen the aged\n            Aeschylus before his departure to Sicily, have been acquainted with Sophocles and\n            Euripides in the highest maturity of their artistic activity, and have seen Phidias and\n            his disciples creating their immortal works before his eyes. When we recollect these\n            things and consider besides what has been said about his relation to the great statesmen\n            of that time, we may form a tolerably complete conception of the influences which worked\n            upon his mental development. There can be no doubt that he expresses his own love and\n            admiration for these intellectual blessings in the delineation of Attic culture and\n            Attic genius which is found in the funeral oration of Pericles, especially in ii. 38 and\n            40. In the joyous recognition of the  to be found in the  we may perceive his delight in the splendour and brilliancy of\n            the Attic stage and the panathenaic processions; and in the charge ()  we can recognize\n            his pride not merely in the well-equipped warlike power of Athens but also in the\n            glorious buildings of the Acropolis, which daily looked down on the citizens. We may\n            conceive, then, that all the means of cultivation which the Athens of Pericles offered,\n            as no other spot in the world has ever offered them within the same limits, and\n            intercourse with men of eminence in all directions, combined to excite and forward the\n            intellectual development of Thucydides up to the maturity of his manhood."}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ou)k\n              e)politeu/sato o( suggrafeu\\s ou)de\\ prosh=lqe tw=| bh/mati"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)n prw/tois h)=gonau)to\\n*)aqhnai=oi strathgiw=n te\n              kai\\ tw=n a)/llwn timw=n a)ciou=ntes"}], "title": "Ep. ad Cn.

All precise knowledge of his early\n            life is wanting; but while on the one hand we cannot doubt that, if Thucydides had taken\n            any prominent part in public affairs, we should have learned the fact either from\n            himself or from some other source, and while it is not at all improbable that his\n            Thracian interests often kept him at a distance from Athens; still on the other hand it\n            is certain that he must have recommended himself  to his fellow-citizens by\n            some manifestation of capacity before B.C. 424, since he was then elected one of the 10\n            Strategi.

As in that passage by the words  he asserts from one point of view his competence as the historian\n            of the Peloponnesian war, so, in order to show the advantage he possessed in wide local\n            knowledge and personal observation of the matters in hand, he adds the statement:\n              . It is certain from this passage that Thucydides, in consequence\n            of his failure to save Amphipolis, had to leave his country for 20 years, and that he\n            employed a portion of this time in visiting the scenes of the war on both sides,\n            particularly in the territory of the Peloponnesians. Everything else, however, which\n            passes beyond this distinct testimony of Thucydides, rests on conjecture; it is\n            probable, though it cannot be proved, that Cleon, who was then at the height of his\n            influence, caused the adoption of the decree for the banishment of Thucydides; it is possible also that the charge brought against him\n            may have been , as is asserted by Marcellinus,\n             55, and the anonymous  biographer,  2, and is\n            apparently implied by Aristophanes  288; and that he may have\n            withdrawn himself by a voluntary exile from the penalty of death thereby incurred. His own expression, , admits\n            this view; and the precise statement of Pausanias, that Thucydides was at a later time\n            recalled from banishment on the motion of Oenobius can only thus be understood. If\n            he had been simply banished by a decree of the people, the peace of Lysander would of\n            itself have given to him, as to other exiles, permission to return home. But if he was\n            subject to a severer sentence, there was need of a special decree; and that such was\n            made under the rule of the Thirty is not incredible in view of the character of their\n            government. Though we may not with Pliny assume that\n            it was due to admiration for his merits as a writer, there can be no doubt that\n            Thucydides, having been persecuted by the extreme democratical party, had his friends\n            among  the ruling faction, to which Oenobius, otherwise unknown, must have\n            belonged. His own statement that his exile lasted twenty years, since it must be\n            reckoned from the end of B.C. 424, leads us to the last months of 404 for the time of\n            his recall.

The speeches of Pericles which he\n            has given us in outline, and the imperishable testimony he has left (ii. 65) of the\n            activity of that great statesman, reflect the vivid impression made on the mind of the\n            historian by that mighty personality; and there can be no doubt that at a later time he\n            was present as an eye-witness at the discussions about Mitylene (iii. 36-49) and about\n            Pylos (iv. 16 ff.); and in all probability he took part in one or more of the\n            expeditions which preceded his own , perhaps\n            in the naval operations of Phormio in the Corinthian Gulf (ii. 80-92), or the movements\n            of Demosthenes in Aetolia and Acarnania (iii. 94 ff.). The statesmen, too, who succeeded\n            Pericles, though they failed to replace him, Nicias, Cleon, Demosthenes, he has\n            succeeded in placing before our eyes in clear outlines. And the young Alcibiades (born\n            B.C. 451), with the brilliancy and haughtiness of his ambitious character, must have\n            early attracted his attention, so vividly does he place him before us in \n            his later speeches and actions. On the other hand, the twenty years which followed the\n            unfortunate result of his  in B.C. 424, were\n            probably passed by Thucydides, so far as the circumstances of the war allowed, mainly on\n            his Thracian property, except at such times as travelling was required by his\n            investigations. It is not likely that the change of control, by which in B.C. 412 (viii.\n            64) the island of Thasos and the neighbouring coast also probably passed into the\n            possession of the Lacedaemonians and was at a later time () recovered by Thrasybulus for the Athenians,\n            interfered at all with his residence there. We are told by Plutarch, and the\n            compiler of the biography of Marcellinus says in two places,\n            that Thucydides wrote his work on his estate in Thrace. This may rest only on\n            conjecture; but it is a conjecture which would be naturally formed by every reader\n            acquainted with the circumstances. We can hardly doubt that it was here mainly that he\n            carried out the work so early undertaken and prosecuted so uninterruptedly; and this not\n            only by the working up of his accumulated materials, but also by the journeys which he\n            undertook from thence for the purpose of closer inquiry into the scenes and the events\n            of the war. We may assume with certainty that he visited not only the various parts of\n            Greece which the war had rendered notable, but also the islands, as well as Italy and\n              Sicily. Besides his own testimony couched in general terms\n              (), we have as evidence the vividness of his\n            delineations of the most important events; and the surprising notice, adduced by\n            Marcellinus,  25, from Timaeus, that after his banishment he lived in Italy\n              (), which in\n             33 goes further and asserts his burial there (), is explained most naturally by the assumption\n            that Thucydides made a long stay in those parts."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "31", "title": "Cim.", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "teleuth=sai e)n th=| *skapth=| *(/ulh|\n                le/getai foneuqei\\s e)kei="}, "#text": "4. 3: ."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "32", "#text": "See above, note\n            25."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "33", "#text": "31-34."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "34", "title": "De Thuc. iud.", "#text": "Cratippus is made by Dion.

The reason of this is, in part at least, the fact that it was\n            not brought to an end by its author. The history suddenly breaks off in the midst of the\n            most exciting events of the Ionic-Decelean war. The most natural conjecture as to the\n            reason of this, that the author was called away from his work by a sudden death, is\n            confirmed by trustworthy evidence. Plutarch says that it was commonly reported that he\n            died a violent death in Scapte Hyle. Pausanias tells us that he was\n            treacherously murdered on his journey home from exile, and that his tomb was to be seen\n            at Athens not far from the Melitid gate. Marcellinus, however, was\n            aware of two different reports: one, which was plainly the most general and is referred\n            to Zopyrus and Cratippus, that Thucydides died in\n              Thrace; the other,\n            for which Didymus is the authority, and which Marcellinus himself adopts, that after his\n            return from exile he died and was buried in Athens. The anonymous biographer leaves the\n            place of his death undefined, saying, after his death he was buried in\n            Athens, near the Melitid gate, . . . whether it was that he himself after the expiration\n            of the term of his exile returned to Athens and there died, or that only his bones were\n            brought from Thrace after his death there; for both accounts are given. When we \n            examine these statements closely, we see that the assumption that Thucydides died at\n            Athens rests only on the well-attested fact of his tomb being found there with an\n            often-quoted inscription. For as his death in a foreign land would naturally be\n            connected with his continued exile, so an honorable burial in Athens would seem to imply\n            that he died there. Pausanias, in order evidently to reconcile the apparent\n            contradiction of his death abroad with his well-known tomb in Attica, devised the\n            harmonizing story that he perished on his homeward journey, for only this can be the\n            meaning of . This solution, however,\n            cannot be accepted; for Thucydides himself speaks so definitely of the end of his\n              banishment, which could have been written only after it was overand\n            he refers so often, and particularly in v. 25 and 26, to the conclusion of the whole\n            war, that he must have lived a considerable time after this, and therefore after his\n            recall, which was subsequent to it; and accordingly we must seek for some other way of\n            explaining the apparent contradiction in the accounts we have. The facts may have been\n            as follows: Thucydides returned in the autumn of B.C. 404 to Athens, six months after\n            the city had surrendered to Lysander. He himself indicates in i. 93.  5 that\n            the walls round the Piraeus lay in ruins, in accordance with the harsh terms of the\n            peace. He can hardly, however, have remained there long, under the increasing severity\n            of the rule of the Thirty; and he may probably have sought again the peace and repose of\n            his Thracian estate, where he had so long been engaged in the preparation of the\n            material he had collected for the history of the war. Though it is probable that large\n            portions of his work, particularly such as were prominent and almost independent parts\n            of the larger whole,e.g. the war of the first ten years to the peace of\n            Nicias, and the expedition to Sicily,were composed and written down before,\n            still, from the even character and unbroken connexion of the eight books as we have\n            them, it seems likely that Thucydides gave the whole its present form in a long period\n            of repose after the end of the war, which a resi dence in enslaved Athens\n            was little calculated to offer. A sudden death overtook him while thus engaged."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "38", "title": ["Beitr. z.

In iii. 116.  2, Thucydides tells us, no doubt after a\n            careful inquiry into the facts, that the eruption of Aetna which took place in the\n            spring of B.C. 425 was the third on record. Accordingly the one which occurred in B.C. 396\n            (Diod. ) could not have been known to him; for as\n            he had given attention to the subject, it is hardly likely that he could have remained\n            in ignorance of it. We may, therefore, conceive that his life extended to about this\n            date, i.e. to his 75th year. We get in this way a period of from six to seven years during which we may\n            imagine that the old man, with that repose and clearness which a powerful spirit obtains\n            from many-sided culture in youth and the experience of good and evil fortune in\n            maturity, was devoted to his great undertaking and engaged in combining the materials he\n            had collected into one completed whole, which with reasonable self-consciousness he\n            designates a . It is very possible that\n            during these last years Thucydides may have undertaken other journeys and \n            have more than once revisited Athens; but it is most natural to suppose that he carried\n            on his proper work in the quietness of his Thracian estate. With\n            this, too, best agrees the statement that he met a violent death by assassination, which\n            is made by Plutarch, Pausanias, and Marcellinus, in reliance on early authorities. An event of the\n            kind in Athens is hard to conceive, and could scarcely have remained without\n            attestation. On the contrary, an attack by robbers on a lonely and wealthy residence on\n            the Thracian coast is easily credible; and thus also is explained the variation in the\n            accounts as regards the place; distance sufficiently accounts for the conflicting\n            opinions of those not immediately interested. But if Thucydides, as is very probable, was\n            slain in Scapte Hyle by the hand of a robber, the second alternative of the anonymous\n              biographer is to be accepted, that his\n            bones were conveyed to Athens and laid in the sepulchre of Cimon, where Plutarch saw his\n            tomb, whether the inscription he quotes be genuine or not: . The difficulty\n            raised by Didymus as to the unauthorized burial of a banished person in his native soil\n            disappears on the hypothesis above given. On the other hand, the suddenness of a death\n            by assassination explains fully the condition in which his history remains to us; the\n            thread of the narrative is broken off before the end of the twenty-first year of the\n            war, in the midst of an account of a subordinate circumstance.

This theory may be thus stated nearly in Ullrich's words: Thucydides regarded the\n            first ten years of continuous war as terminated by the Peace of Nicias; and accordingly\n            after the conclusion of that peace began to compose the history of this war, which by\n            itself was sufficiently remarkable: beginning with the preface of the first book, he\n            wrote this book, the second, the third, and the first half of the fourth in exile,\n            before he could have had knowledge of the later war: then, towards the middle of the\n            fourth book, being overtaken by\n            the march of events, when the war between Athens and Sparta began again before Syracuse,\n            and was afterwards in the Decelean and Ionian war carried on more actively than before\n            through the participation of all the Hellenes including even the Argives and the Greeks\n            of Italy and Sicily, he discontinued his work in order to await the result of this\n            second war: while these events, however, were taking place, he was constantly making\n            preparations for the continuation of his work by collecting information about facts and\n            by prosecuting inquiries; and after a break of from ten to eleven years, i.e. from the\n            beginning of the Decelean war to his return to Athens, he took up again the thread of\n            his narrative. With this view is connected the conjecture that, as Thucydides completed\n            the first three books and half the fourth after his banishment and during the Peace of\n            Nicias, i.e. in about eight years, so the composition of the second portion, which he\n            did not  begin till after the conclusion of the whole war, may have required\n            about as much more time. This will accord very well with the assumption made that B.C.\n            396 must be regarded as the extreme limit of his life."}, "Ullrich argues that, on the assumption that Thucydides did not begin the final\n            redaction of his work until the end of the twentyseven-years' war, the whole of it must\n            have been written with the consciousness of the final result, and could not therefore\n            contain any statements which are incompatible with this assumption. Such statements are\n            however, according to Ullrich, discoverable in the former part of the history (as far as\n            v. 26) and not in the latter; and he infers, therefore, that the former half must have\n            been written substantially as we have it between the end of the ten-years' war and the\n            Sicilian expedition. He admits, indeed, that these earlier books contain certain\n            passages which imply a knowledge of the whole war, but regards them as later insertions\n            made by Thucydides himself in the work he had already substantially completed.", {"hi": {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "Bursian's Jahresbericht"}, "bibl": {"@n": "Thuc. 3.87.5", "#text": "iii.87.5"}, "pb": {"@n": "22"}, "#text": "The passages which Ullrich cites, as having been penned by a writer who could not have\n            known the final issue of the war, are the following: i. 10.  2; 23. \n            1-3; ii. 1.  1; 8. 1; 34. 20; 54.  3; 57. 7; iii. 86.  2;\n            87. 5; iv. 48.  5.

The judgment of Theophrastus, which Cicero has preserved for us, is only of a general character, and hardly answers to our\n            own high estimate. But out of this silence of earlier antiquity there comes to us, only\n            the more welcome and important, the single notice, that the orator Demosthenes copied\n            the books of Thucydides eight times with his own hand. It was his own kindred spirit which attracted him above all to the\n            essential truthfulness of the great historian.\n            The pre-eminent effect of his work, however, is shown by the fact that a series of\n            successors, Xenophon, Cratippus, Theopompus, essayed to continue it, but no one ventured\n            to take up again the material handled by him or to throw it into a different form;\n            until, when a later time called for a general review or instructive entertainment, men\n            fastened upon Thucydides, though often with deficient judgment and insight, as the most\n            trustworthy source for the period treated by him. Among the Romans the masterly\n            character of his work was thoroughly recognized, in spite of the difficulty caused by\n            his language and style; his statesmanlike insight attracted them and excited their\n            admiration. Sallust exhibits the clearest proofs of conscious imitation; Cornelius Nepos\n            follows by preference his testimony; and Cicero studied him persistently and\n              closely; Quintilian expresses in few words an excellent judgment about him as\n            regards his style."}, {"pb": [{"@n": "26"}, {"@n": "27"}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "52", "title": "Bibliothecae\n              codex", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ei)likrinou=s kai\\\n                kaqarou= kai\\ *)attikou= lo/gou kano/nas kai\\ sta/qmas kai\\ para/deigma/ qhsin\n                a)/riston *pla/twna/ te kai\\ *dhmosqe/nhn meta\\ tou= r(htorikou= tw=n e)nne/a\n                xorou=, *qoukudi/dhn te kai\\ *cenofw=nta kte(."}, "#text": "See especially Phrynichus in Photius,  150, p. 101, ed.

On the other\n            hand, the scholastic rhetoric of the later age, as it was practised and brought into\n            currency by learned Greeks particularly at Rome, was ill-adapted to comprehend and\n            appreciate the most peculiar characteristics of Thucydides, his complete self-surrender\n            to his subject and the determination of the form only by the nature of the matter. From\n            the most important representative of this tendency, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, we\n            possess two treatises ( and , the second being a more detailed development\n            of a section of the former) in which he exclusively, and a third () in\n            which he partially (3), undertakes a thorough examination of the work of Thucydides as\n            to form and matter. Interesting and instructive to us as these writings are, as\n            furnishing us with a living picture of the way in which literary and grammatical\n            criticism was practised by the rhetoricians of that day, and as containing in detail\n            many useful remarks, yet the criticisms themselves, whether we regard the choice and\n            arrangement of the material or the way in which it is handled and discussed, are wholly\n            without value for us. Dionysius has so little conception of the task of history, to\n            bring to light the actual course of events as it would disclose itself to unbiassed\n            inquiry, that he actually makes it a reproach to Thucydides that he selected as his\n            subject the history of a war which was unsuccessful.\n            He imputes  to a passion for singularity the division of the war-years into\n            summer and winter which Thucydides adopted. He blames him for arranging particular parts\n            without having regard to their best rhetorical effect; e.g. that the funeral oration is\n            placed where it is and not after some important event of the war. He is displeased that events are not treated at all\n            times on a scale proportionate to their relative importance. He even\n            attributes it to the arbitrary will of the writer that the work is broken off before the\n            end of the war. In general he fails to find a\n            skilful distribution of the material or any proper employment of rhetorical arrangement\n            and ornament. In fact in the whole criticism the same contrast finds expression as is to\n            be seen between the historical writing of Thucydides and that of Dionysius himself; in\n            the latter, a dressing up of facts to suit arbitrary assumptions and subjective\n            theories; in the former, an absolute subordination of the record to the facts which are\n            to be narrated."}, "We have already noticed the circumstances in the life of Thucydides which specially\n            favoured him as the writer of the history of his time.

We shall probably not be mistaken if we\n            attribute to the influence of the philosophical conception of the order of the world,\n            which Anaxagoras made current among the most prominent men of Athens, that religious\n            view which apprehends the agency of the gods not so much in the immediate indications of\n            a personal presence, which was so natural to Herodotus and the earlier chroniclers, as\n            in a controlling power, which is indeed withdrawn from human sight, yet is nevertheless\n            to be reverenced with the feeling of complete dependence. It is true that, in the\n            expression of this, the customary language of the popular belief and of the traditional\n            forms of worship is not abandoned. The personal name, , appears most frequently either as a collective designation of those\n            generally venerated divinities under whose protection the people feel themselves to be,\n            whose feasts they celebrate and by whom they swear (; 78. 13; ; 71. 21; ; ; ; ; ), or in application to particular deities who are\n            understood without their being named, as the Delphian Apollo (; 118. 20; 123. 8; ; ; ; ), Athene (; ; 15. 17; ),\n            or the Eumenides, , (). Only once, in a Boeotian religious formula, is\n               used for , (). Yet the belief which rises\n            above the forms of special worship to the general conception of divine government finds\n            distinct expression in some places. It is to the writer an infallible symptom of extreme\n            disturbance in the order of society if awe of the divine is broken down, whether, as in\n            ii. 53.  4, this is the result of the fearful plague at Athens (), or, as\n            in iii. 82.  6, of the virulence of party hatred (). In the remarkable debate between the Athenian\n            envoys and the council of the Melians (v. 85. ff.), on the one side the consciousness of\n            a good  cause manifests itself by confidence in protection from above\n              (), and on the other the exaltation of brute\n            strength above every other consideration shows how the sense of right and wrong had\n            become confused. In the same sense Nicias in his last speech () is represented as basing his hope on this . The real sentiment of Thucydides is expressed in the noble words\n            with which Pericles () urges his fellow-citizens to\n            meet the uncertain future: . What in this\n            passageand only hereprobably with some allusion to the language of\n            the philosophersis called , i.e.\n            everything which in the life of man is sent by a higher hand and is withdrawn from the\n            calculation and control of human prudence, Thucydides usually embraces under the term\n              , as an operative power, and  as the manifestation of it; the former in ; 144. 24; ;\n              ; 97. 6; ; 18. 20; 64. 7 (); 86. 21; ; 75. 12 (); 111. 17; ; 78. 15 (); ; 67.\n            23; 68. 1: the latter in ; 78. 5; 84. 19 (); ; ; ; : and in the\n            same sense  or , ; ; . It is\n            of no importance for a critical examination of Thucydides's use of language whether\n            these expressions are found in his own narrative or are placed by him in the mouths of\n            his speaking characters. Everywhere we are to understand by  a power superior to man, which is not blind chance, but exercises\n            control in accordance with a higher order; on which man can never calculate, but the\n            operation of which he cannot without damage disregard. If  is opposed to , as in ; , this is\n            from the human point of view, which finds its calculations at fault; but it is by no\n            means intended to assert the superiority of the latter. In the remarkable declaration on\n            the death of Nicias (), \n            \n            , Thucydides does not conceal that it\n            will not always be easy for the human understanding to reconcile itself to the\n            incomprehensible administration of the divine omnipotence. It is characteristic that\n            nowhere is  more distinctly referred to its divine\n            source than by the Melians in their fruitless struggle against the doctrine of the right\n            of the strongest.

And while it is the aim of the\n            writer in the spirit of Anaxagoras to inquire into the causes of surprising\n            incidents,as of the eclipse of the sun, ; of a flood consequent upon an earthquake, ; of the eclipse of the moon, in contrast with the superstitious\n            terror () of Nicias, ; of violent tempests, in contrast with the alarm of the dispirited\n            Athenians, ;still he does not venture\n            to draw the line between the province of positive human knowledge and that where the\n            obscure operation of the gods makes itself felt in human things. Accordingly, while he\n            is far from unconditionally ascribing validity to omens and oracles, and even allows\n            himself to make a critical examination of their true meaning (; 54. 9), and in  plainly admits\n            the assumption that even the utterances of the Delphian oracles could be corruptly\n            procured, still his bringing forward instances of omens and oracles actually verified\n              (; ), and\n            in general his frequent mention of predictions, portents, and marvellous occurrences\n              (; 134. 18; ; 77. 22; 102. 27; ; 92. 18; 96. 3;\n            104. 2; ; ; 45.\n            20; ), proves that he does not mean to deny the\n            possibility of supernatural operations. Just as he views , so he allows to the supersensible world no influence over the\n            judgment and action of men, and therefore for practical purposes leaves it out of\n            account. It is very intelligible to him that in times of excitement men should look\n            about for miraculous instruction () or help (); but he himself attaches no importance to such\n            things, and  has had no experience of useful results therefrom; and his real\n            opinion would probably coincide with that of the Athenian envoys, , whose advice to the Melians is: ."}, "Clearness and definiteness were essential to Thucydides; and accordingly the proper\n            sphere of his observation and inquiry was man, his action and his history. The less he\n            tried to penetrate into the secret course of the divine government of the world, so much\n            the more earnest was he to attain the most exact knowledge of everything which makes up\n            the life of man; the motives of his action as well as their external manifestation; the\n            efforts and conduct of individuals as well as the great movements which take place in\n            the life of states. His judgment of human affairs, however, is controlled by one\n            principle, that it is power of mind which makes up the value of the individual, just as\n            it conditions the result

He is fully alive to the\n            weakness of human nature, and often insists upon its limitations (e.g. ; 84. 10; ); and\n            yet he is penetrated with the conviction that the spirit of man can attain the mastery\n            over the agitating influences of the surrounding world and nature, and is competent in\n            large measure to define and shape its own life as well as the fortunes of states. The\n            views of Thucydides may thus have been influenced by the doctrines of Anaxagoras; yet\n            his use of language manifests independence, and deserves a special examination so far as\n            it touches the phenomena of the mind. The centre of all the mental power of man is for\n            Thucydides the power of thought and cognition, from which come the energetic will and\n            resolutions which press to action. This power, however, is not called , which word occurs in Thucydides only in the less\n            pregnant sense of the perceiving and observing faculty, but  rather , which has in our\n            author a very wide range of meaning. It includes the aggregate of psychical powers,\n            intellectual as well as emotional, as opposed to the body (cf. especially ; ); sometimes,\n            however, it denotes on the intellectual side insight and cognition in general (cf. ; 75. 2; 77. 9; 91. 25; ; 34. 17; 43. 21; 62. 30; 65. 32; ; 83. 4; etc.); or a view, opinion, judgment, in reference to a\n            particular matter (cf. ; 33. 17; 45. 1; 53. 7; 62.\n            8; 78. 2; 79. 5; 140. 28; ; 86. 17; ; 36. 5; 92. 3; 96. 8; ; 32. 23; 58. 5; 59. 3; ); sometimes on the\n            moral side it denotes disposition, temper, decision, as a quality (cf. ; 90. 10; 130. 10; ;\n            11. 21; 20. 18; 59. 4, 8; 64. 32; 65. 3; 87. 9; 88. 7; ; 10. 6; 12. 2; etc.), or a determination in a particular case (cf.\n              , ;\n              ; ;\n              , ; ; ). In the same way the verb ,\n            and its compounds with ,\n            is used sometimes with an intellectual meaning,  (cf. ; 36. 3; 86. 2; 91. 5; 102. 15;\n            126. 21; 134. 5; ; 43. 10; 60. 17, 19), sometimes\n            with a moral reference,  (cf. , 26; 91. 23; ;\n              ; 57. 3; ). By the\n            side of this verb  often occurs in the same\n            sense (cf. ; 18. 18; 52. 6; 93. 22; 124. 18; 141. 2;\n            143. 22; ; 93. 16; 100. 20; ; 75. 18; 82. 35; ; etc.), and\n            it is notable that while  remains on the lower\n            plane,  is placed nearly on a par with , as well in the sense of a perfected intellectual power\n            and state of mind (cf. ; 61. 12; 89. 23; ; ; 21. 3;\n              ), as in that of its employment in a particular\n            case,  (cf. ; 130. 9; 132. 20; 138. 2; 140. 10; 144. 5; ; ; 82. 22; ; ; 105. 21;\n              ; 31. 6; 38. 19; 65. 2; 76. 5; , 25). Other compounds of , both substantival and verbal, occur frequently in Thucydides, always\n            with reference to mental action. As to meaning \n            stands very  close to , but only in\n            the intellectual sense of clear insight and circumspection (cf. ; 140. 8; ; 97. 33; ; 82. 50; ;\n            81. 10; 85. 21; ). (On the combination  in , see\n            the note on the passage.) Thucydides uses the verb  only in , of acquaintance with\n            a language; but the adjective  is his usual word\n            to describe a man of clear insight (cf. ; 79. 8; 84.\n            15; 138. 8; ; 82. 27; ; ; ), while from  or\n               no corresponding epithet is formed; and\n               occurs only in  with the unfavourable sense of  so , , and , , have a similar implication. Thucydides uses  absolutely only a few times (; ; , ); elsewhere with defining\n            adverbs (cf. ; ; ; ). He does not employ  and\n              : but  occurs in the sense of  (cf. ; ; 61. 13; 62. 27; ; ; ; 43. 7;\n              ).  is in\n            Thucydides most commonly  or  in\n            a wide as well as in a restricted sense; and only as derived from this has it sometimes\n            the meaning of an expressed reason (cf. ; ; ; 98. 2;\n              ; 92. 20), or of consideration based upon this\n            (cf. ; , 89. 8; perhaps\n            also ). This last meaning of a reasonable\n            consideration or calculation is distinctly prominent in the phrases  (cf. ;\n              ; ) and\n               (cf. ; 140. 11; ; 91. 15; ; 55. 17; 65. 18; ; ), as well as in the compounds\n               (cf. ; ; ; 105. 20; ; 79. 9; 84. 10; 85.\n            2; ) and  (cf. ; ; 87. 12; ; 79.\n            10; 84. 6). The verb  and its compounds with\n               (cf. ; ; ; ; 73. 17; ; 26. 18; 87. 1; ; 31. 34; 36. 11; ; 77. 21;\n              ), and  the noun  (cf. ; 40. 14,\n            23; ; ; 92.\n            10; 108. 23; 122. 9; ; ; ), belong to the same\n            sphere (they often, however, refer to a literal reckoning with numbers); while , which is used chiefly of judicial decision (cf. ; 57. 3; 67. 20; ; ; ; 40. 16), is not seldom transferred to any judgment based on reason\n            (cf. ; 22. 19; 138. 15; ; 40. 15; 53. 13; ; ; ; 89. 9; ). To  in the\n            sense of an intelligent course of reasoning is related , of prudent consideration (cf. ; ; 111. 27; ), with the compounds or derivatives  (),  (; ),  (),  (; ; 44. 4),  (; ; ), ,\n               Thucydides uses \n            almost exclusively of physical life (cf. ; ; ); only\n            in  () is it employed in a moral sense, though this is the constant meaning\n            of the compounds  (cf. ; 39. 7; 43. 23; ; ) and  (cf. ; 121. 16; ;\n            89. 11; ; ).

As he referred all human virtue to knowledge\n            and therefore regarded it as capable of being taught and learnt, so with Thucydides the\n            capacity of men on which he  sets the highest value rests first of all on\n            clearness and acuteness of insight, which judges correctly the existing relations of\n            things, and thus is able to take a sure glance into the future. See especially the\n            description of Themistocles, i. 138, in whom the  resulted in his being not only  but also . Pericles also is  () because he\n            is  (, 22), and because, as being  (), he\n            had clearly foreseen the importance of the war (,\n              ).

Thucydides gives us in iii. 82, on the occasion of the\n            party warfare in Corcyra, a grand picture of the utter disturbance of all the relations\n            of life which takes its rise from confusion of ideas.

But since in human affairs it is only seldom that right and wrong\n            can be estimated with perfect exactness, the recognition and defence of one's own\n            interest is a necessary condition of self-preservation. Not only Cleon (iii. 37. ff.)\n            but also Diodotus (iii. 42. ff.) maintains the policy of interest; and even the\n            Plataeans seek to move the Spartans to mercy (iii. 56.  7) by the apprehension\n            of their real advantage. But how little Thucydides sympathized with the cynical doctrine\n            of the right of the stronger which the Athenians proclaim in their dialogue with the\n            Melians (v. 85-113) is shown unmistakably by the manner in which he allows it to be\n            displayed in all its revolting recklessness at that very point in his narrative where\n            the Athenian empire received its last petty accession, and the Sicilian expedition was\n            about to be undertaken which was destined to result in its overthrow. He rather shows\n            with abundant clearness the high regard he has for that temper which even in political\n            matters gives a hearing not merely to strict right but also to considerations of\n            humanity and compassion. This magnanimity, which does not allow the weaker to feel the\n            full weight of superior power, but rather lays him under obligation by benefit, is\n            called by him chiefly  (cf. ; 69. 8; ; 51.\n            20; 71. 18; ; 56. 27; 57. 10; 58. 2; ; 81. 10; 86. 19; ; ). Compassion and mercy are in\n            his eyes noble feelings. It is true that he makes Cleon reject them with unfeeling\n            roughness (, ); but where they are recklessly outraged, the tone of his\n            narration allows his condemnatory judgment to be felt, e.g. in the execution of the\n            Plataeans, iii. 68, and in the mournful fate of the captured Athenians, vii. 86, 87. Not\n            less clearly does Thucydides represent the motive of honour as a noble and worthy one in\n            the dealings of men. The feeling itself he calls \n            in ; in other places  (cf. ; ; ; ; 111. 16); and he sets high value upon it, just as in\n            his finest speeches he gives a prominent place to a regard for fame among contemporaries\n            and posterity (cf. ii. 41.  4; 64. 27; iii. 57.  2). A noble\n            bearing, which unselfishly keeps in view the  higher aims of human life, is\n            described by Thucydides chiefly as  (cf. ; ; 53. 9; 64.\n            28; ; 55. 11; 94. 16; ; ; 69. 10; 107. 2; ; ; 71. 4;\n              ; 12. 8), and the opposite character by  (cf. ; 122. 16;\n              ; 64. 29; ; 58. 5; ; ; ); in which we see a\n            preparation for the more strictly ethical usage of Plato. The combination , which became so current at a later time,\n            Thucydides uses once () in a moral sense, and once\n              () as a designation of the aristocratical\n            party."}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "gnw/mh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "cu/nesis"}], "#text": "But while Thucydides thus concedes the fullest right to moral worth and the nobler\n            sentiments of humanity, he yet finds the highest quality of a statesman in the\n            controlling power of the thinking mind, in  or\n              , which gives a clear insight into the reality\n            of things.

The same method was resorted to\n            with the happiest results also in the most strict historical writing to give expression\n            to the inner side of the transactions recorded; and it may be added that, as this method\n            gives objective utterance to the psychological side of historical representation, so in\n            philosophical dialogue the clearest statement of the dialectical development of thought\n            was effected in the same way. Thucydides sets himself to adhere as exactly as possible\n            to the speeches actually delivered; of this his own words in i. 22.  1 leave\n            no doubt. But that this effort is directed rather to the thoughts than to the form of\n            what was said he states himself distinctly in the words . Indeed at\n            this time a verbally accurate report of the words uttered is not conceivable. In\n            default, therefore, of an exact account of the language actually used Thucydides\n            supplied what was lacking, . In the free use of\n            this principle he allows himself to bring forward a speaker to controvert views and\n            reasons which have been put forth by a different speaker at another place and time. We\n            find unmistakable examples of this sort in the speech of the Corinthian ambassadors, i.\n            120. ff., as compared with that of Archidamus, i. 80. ff., and in the first speech of\n            Pericles, i. 140. ff., in reference to the Corinthian speech just mentioned. So there\n            can be little doubt that to the writer is due the reservation of a part of his material\n            which Pericles announces in  () and its subsequent introduction in ii. 13.  2 ff. It\n            is a natural result, therefore, of this mode of treatment that, while the language of\n            the Thucydidean speeches, both in the structure of sentences and in particular\n            expressions, has a uniform character, viz., that of the writer, still in each separate\n            speech the character and mode of thought of the assumed speaker are clearly manifested.\n            This is true of all the speeches without exception, and no less so of the debate between\n            the Athenian envoys and the representatives of the island of Melos (\n            \n            ), v. 85-111. Grote, it is true, has\n            great doubts of the accuracy of this report, and ascribes the larger part of it to the\n            dramatic genius and arrangement of the writer. But we may very\n            well assume that on this occasion a report or minute of the discussion was made by the\n            Athenian deputies and generals, which was kept in the archives of the senate at Athens\n            and of which Thucydides even in his own absence could have obtained an accurate\n            knowledge, as he did of other documents which he records and of the letter of Nicias,\n            vii. 11-15. We may assume also in regard to reports of shorter utterances, that they\n            rest upon authentic transmission. Cf. iii. 113.  2 ff.; viii. 53. \n            3; . The few statements of this character, which\n            are introduced in direct or indirect speech, have the effect of great vividness and\n            present to us an important crisis with high distinctness. When, however, events develop\n            themselves in rapid succession and the press of circumstances forbids the employment of\n            set speeches, the brief and condensed  of what was said serve to enliven the narrative.\n            Compare the considerable extracts from the second speech of Pericles, ii. 13; from\n            Cleon's speeches, iv. 22. and 28. It is probably for this reason that in the eighth\n            book, when the changes are so rapid and the character of many transactions there\n            recorded is so peculiar that they did not lend themselves to formal treatment, the\n            thoughts and purposes of the agents are communi-cated indirectly (cf. viii. 27; 46; 53;\n            63; 67; 76; 81) and we find no complete speeches."}, {"pb": [{"@n": "44"}, {"@n": "45"}, {"@n": "46"}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "71", "#text": "Disparaging assertions of the fickleness of the mob and the influence of\n              demagogues are found in ii. 21.  2, 3; 59.  1, 2; 65. \n              10 ff.; iii. 36.  4; iv. 28.  5; vi. 63.  2.

He does not indeed occupy the position of an\n            indifferent spectator of events and their results; we are everywhere conscious how\n            completely he is an Athenian in sentiment, and how deeply he  sympathizes\n            with the fortunes of Athens, though he never gives expression to this feeling; he\n            belongs indeed by birth and by social position to the aristocratical party, but looks\n            for welfare only in a well-tempered form of government, and is always inclined to those\n            statesmen who unite force of character with good sense and moderation. This sentiment\n            appears in definite expressions as well as by many other indications; but\n            Thucydides always concedes to those entertaining views opposed to his own the right of\n            expressing their reasons; and in the conviction that in human affairs error is always\n            associated with truth, that in political matters absolute right and truth are never\n            wholly on one side, he presents speech and counter-speech with equally clear and careful\n            elaboration. At the very beginning the speeches of the Corcyraeans (i. 32-36) and the\n            Corinthians (i. 37-43) give us an insight into a conflict which from the irritation of\n            the parties no longer admits a peaceable settlement; and the opposition appears with yet\n            greater intensity in the speeches made at Sparta by the Corinthians (i. 68-71) and the\n            Athenians (i. 73-78). At Sparta too the peace party and the war party find their living\n            utterance in the speeches of Archidamus (i. 80-85) and Stheneladas (i. 86);\n            but it is felt that passion has now the better of moderation. With excellent effect,\n            therefore, the pre-eminent position of Pericles is set before us. He proves\n            incontestably (i. 140-144) the necessity of the war from a consideration of the dignity\n            and power of Athens, and in a short review (ii. 13) sets forth the sufficiency of her\n            means; and when the beginning of the war does not answer their expectations, he is able\n            in his incomparable funeral oration (ii. 35-46) to keep his fellow-citizens up to the\n            fulness of resolve by the stimulation of a noble and justifiable self-respect; and when\n            undeserved misfortune has bowed their spirit and confidence, in his farewell speech (ii.\n            60-64) he raises their courage again by calling to mind all the greatness of the past\n            and the present. Not less clearly do we become acquainted with  the way in\n            which other leading men thought and acted, from their speeches whether longer or\n            shorter; e.g. Phormio, ii. 89; Demosthenes, iv. 10; Brasidas, iv. 85-87, of whom it is\n            said, ; Hippocrates, iv. 95; Hermocrates, iv. 59-64; Nicias, vi. 68; vii.\n            61-64; 77; Gylippus, vii. 66-68; Alcibiades in Sparta, vi. 89-92. But the art of\n            Thucydides in setting forth with objective clearness the reasons  and  of controverted questions is shown most\n            conspicuously in the speeches of Cleon and Diodotus, iii. 37-40; 42-48, on the Lesbian\n            affair; of the Plataean and Theban deputies, iii. 53-59; 61-67, on the Plataean\n            question; of Nicias and Alcibiades, vi. 9-14; 16-18; 20-23, on the Sicilian expedition;\n            of Hermocrates and Athenagoras, vi. 33-34; 36-40, on the defence of Syracuse; of\n            Hermocrates and the Athenian ambassador Euphemus, vi. 76-80; 82-87, on the accession of\n            Camarina. Without our own choice we find ourselves involved in the conflict of\n            interests, and are put in a position to form judgment for ourselves from the situation\n            of affairs and the feeling of parties. Very seldom does the historian himself add a word\n            of comment. The most remarkable instance of his doing so is found in the declarations\n            which he makes with regard to the transactions in which Cleon takes part; in iii. 36.\n             6, on the decision about the Lesbians; and in iv. 21.  3; 22.\n             2; 28.  3 ff.; 39.  3, about Pylos and the consequent\n            proposals of peace made by the Lacedaemonians. The strong aversion which Thucydides\n            manifests when he describes the person and actions of Cleon has been attributed in\n            ancient as well as in modern times to the personal reason that Cleon was probably the\n            cause of the banishment of the historian (see above, p. 11); and this is regarded as a\n            violation of historical impartiality. Grote expresses this opinion most decidedly. But the assumption of any hostile movement on Cleon's part against Thucydides\n            rests only on conjecture, and appears in fact not necessary to explain the\n            unconcealed aversion felt by the historian to Cleon. Thucydides a little more than a\n            year after the death of Pericles, who is the object of his love and admiration, says of\n            Cleon, , \n            \n            , and in , with\n            nearly the same words, . We\n            have in these words only the application to a concrete case of the bitter feeling which\n            had already (ii. 65.  7 ff.) found expression in general terms, where the\n            melancholy contrast is drawn out between the  and the ruinous conduct of those who . Those judgments about Cleon,\n            whose nature had not a trace of the exalted magnanimity of Pericles, are the legitimate\n            expression of the historian's profound sorrow at the decline of his country, which he\n            saw, after being controlled so gloriously by Pericles, surrendered to the selfseeking\n            ambition of unworthy men. He points thus prominently at Cleon because there can be no\n            doubt that before the Lesbian affairhe was even then he had attained great influence with the\n            mob and had probably embittered the last years of Pericles. If from the speeches in\n            Thucydides the same picture of various personalities presents itself to us as the\n            historian had formed in his own mind, the highest aim is reached which any historian can\n            attain. Genuine impartiality does not exclude judgment and personal conviction in regard\n            either to the wisdom or the moral value of purposes and actions. But it is necessary\n            that we should be furnished with the materials for forming our own opinions\n            independently of the previous judgment of the writer. Thucydides has done this for us to\n            an extent and in a manner which probably no other historian has equalled; and in this\n            lies his imperishable value for all time."}, {"pb": {"@n": "47"}, "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "75", "title": "Brut.", "hi": {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "ante Periclem . . . et Thucydidem, qui non nascentibus Athenis\n                sed iam adultis fuerunt, littera nulla est quae quidem ornatum aliquem habeat et\n                oratoris esse videatur."}, "#text": "Cic.  7.\n              27:"}, "#text": "In close correspondence with the effort the historian is evidently always making to get\n            as close as possible to men and things in their real relations, is his expression in\n            language, which he has, we may say, moulded to suit his great task. To form a just\n            appreciation of its peculiarities we must consider first of all that Thucydides was  the first to employ the Attic speech for the purposes of historical\n            narrative. It may be said in general that Attic prose as a written language was then in\n            the first stage of its development. It cannot, it is true, be doubted that in the period\n            from Solon to Pericles with its momentous political changes the Attic speech had in the\n            manifold needs of public and private life formed itself to that character of simplicity,\n            clearness, and definiteness by which it is distinguished above all the other Greek\n            dialects. It must have been employed in the literary efforts of the Pisistratidae for\n            many sorts of records; and it is still more certain that after the restoration of\n            freedom the living word of the great statesmen from Clisthenes to Cimon must have\n            exerted the most potent influence on the cultivation and settlement of the language. But\n            this is again in its kind a phenomenon without parallel in history, that a people so\n            rarely dowered as the Greek could live through a long period, crowded with the highest\n            human interest and calling into play all forms of political and intellectual activity,\n            without leaving any evidences of its existence except in artistic form.

We find in him a considerable number of expressions which occur only in later\n            imitators; but we must not attribute to him on this account a conscious seeking after\n            what is unusual or antiquated. In some cases our judgment is at fault, because we do\n            not know what was usual in the cultivated speech of his time at Athens; and herein\n            Dionysius himself also was at a loss. We have to make allowance for the creative power\n            of a master mind which is not content to take the inherited material of language as\n            all-sufficient for every need of expression, but understands how to employ new forms\n            according to the necessities of his thought. Thucydides may rightly claim the  and the  which Dionysius (24. 6) attributes to him; but he\n            is far from abusing in an arbitrary and capricious way the right of innovation which a\n            language in the fresh ness of its vigour concedes to a subtle and accurate\n            thinker, though this is what Dionysius with little insight, charges him with. A list of all the words which are peculiar to Thucydides or nearly so will show\n            such forms only as are in accordance with the spirit of the Greek language; and a close\n            examination will, in all cases, make manifest their fitness for use in their several\n            places. In proof of this attention may be called to two of the usages which are of\n            especially frequent occurrence. He uses probably oftener than any other writer the\n            neuter singular of adjectives and participles as abstract substantives; e.g. ,  There is in this no capricious\n            mannerism; but he is striving to clothe the abstract idea in a dress which may render it\n            in the particular case more easy of apprehension, while at the same time the neuter\n            secures the maintenance of that indefiniteness which pertains to the notion itself. To a\n            similar effort to elevate general conceptions as far as possible to distinct\n            apprehension is due his tendency to employ verbal nouns in  and . Examples of the former occur\n            in ; 138. 14; of the latter, ; -30.\n            Dionysius ascribes this tendency to mere wilfulness. Hermogenes shows a better judgment when he attributes the frequent\n            employment of nominal forms instead of verbal ones to an effort to give to the\n            expression of the thought greater dignity and elevation than could be secured by the use\n            of the corresponding verbs."}, {"pb": [{"@n": "50"}, {"@n": "51"}], "bibl": [{"@n": "Thuc. 1.32.18", "#text": "i.32.18"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 1.19.3", "#text": "i.19.3"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 2.65.7", "#text": "ii.65.7"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 1.1.8", "#text": "i.1.8"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 1.1.6", "#text": "i.1.6"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 1.100.15", "#text": "i.100.15"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 1.32.8", "#text": "i.32.8"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 1.69.4", "#text": "i.69.4"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 1.33.12", "#text": "i.33.12"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 2.61.19", "#text": "ii.61.19"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 1.28.12", "#text": "i.28.12"}, {"@n": "Thuc. 2.7.18", "#text": "ii.7.18"}], "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)leuqeri/as"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "tina"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "th\\n au)/chsin"}], "#text": "The position of words is of yet more importance in the style of Thucydides. It is a law\n            of the Greek language that the order of internal importance shall as far as possible be\n            manifested in the order of external position; not indeed that the external arrange ment defines the importance of the words; but the oral utterance obeys its\n            own special laws, and natural feeling permits these to be treated with freedom. Here\n            much must be left to the observation of the reader; but a few observations of\n            far-reaching application may be offered. (1) Thucydides is fond of placing at the\n            beginning of a sentence the principal object in the accusative, giving thus as it were\n            in a single word the theme of the discussion. In these cases the grammatical connexion\n            is often relaxed and sometimes wholly abandoned. Cf. , and the examples there cited. Similarly portions of the predicate are\n            placed before the conjunction which introduces the sentence. Cf. ; 77. 6; . (2) A general predicate\n            noun is placed first in connexion with a following superlative, as noted on ; by this arrangement the noun becomes as it were the text\n            of the following remark. (3) Of a different kind are the numerous cases in which a noun\n            without the article is placed before a qualifying participle or adjective with the\n            article; for this throws the principal stress on the qualifying word; for examples see\n            on . This order is frequent also in Herodotus, but\n            comparatively rare in other Attic writers. (4) Partitive genitives, as representing the\n            principal notion, generally stand before the governing nouns, particularly in\n            designations of places, when the name of the country usually precedes that of a portion\n            of it. See on . So the objective genitive stands\n            between a preposition and the noun on which it depends. See on . (5) Two clauses closely related and connected by a copula\n            as two objects of the same verb, two verbs with the same object, two\n            predicatesare often separated by another word of importance. This is not\n            peculiar to Thucydides but is a favourite arrangement with him. The effect of it is not\n            to dislocate the structure, but the interposed obstruction forces into notice the\n            essential connexion of the separated clauses. Examples of this occur on nearly every\n            page; as in  (), 17 (), 18 (). (6) Conversely a parallelism in structure\n            occasionally is found where there is no exact correspondence in thought. Cf. ; 69. 32; 138. 18; ; 74. 16. (7) Great weight is sometimes laid upon an adverbial\n            expression by its position at the close of the sentence, an arrangement often used by\n            Demosthenes.

It is in such passages that we best apprehend the effort of the\n            writer to give complete expression to his thought by means of a vehicle not yet reduced\n            to entire flexibility. Thucydides shares with all energetic  thinkers the\n            desire to use no superfluous words. It is not surprising, therefore, that we cannot\n            without trouble penetrate through the condensed phrase to the full apprehension of his\n            meaning, especially in those cases where the most hidden processes of thought and\n            feeling are to be indicated. It cannot be asserted that Thucydides aims at brevity and\n            finds pleasure in dark expressions. The truth is that in the department in which he\n            laboured the Greek language had little or nothing previously worked out, and that he had\n            often to wrestle painfully with a resisting material to find satisfactory expression for\n            what he desired to say. The evidence of this laborious effort is to be seen in many\n            inequalities in the work. Still, where the text is not certainly corrupt, honest and\n            resolute effort will always succeed in grasping the true sense of the writer even in the\n            most difficult passages. The task of understanding Thucydides in all his parts and all his peculiarities\n            is, it is true, no light one, but it well repays the effort. It bestows in\n            preminent degree the satisfactory feeling of sharing the labour of thought\n            with a profound and noble intellect. We can observe how in particular cases the thought\n            of the writer has even in the very moulding of his sentence taken a direction different\n            from that he started with, and thus has shifted into inconsistency of expression.

Some regard\n            the absence of speeches as a proof that its author had not given it its final form:\n            others find this fact sufficiently explained by the character of the events recorded in\n            it. The latter view is probably correct:\n            yet there are many points of style and matter which seem to indicate that the book did\n            not receive the last revision of the author, particularly the fact that it breaks off in\n            the midst of a narrative uncompleted. This, combined with the divergent statements as to\n            the manner and place of the death of the writer, gave occasion even in antiquity to\n            various conjectures, which are recorded by Marcellinus,  43, 44; as that a\n            daughter of Thucydides wrote the book, or Theopompus, or Xenophon. There is no\n            probability internal or external for any one of these. There may be so much truth as\n            this: that the daughter of Thucydides, after her father's sudden death by an attack of\n            robbers, saved his unfinished work from destruction, and gave it for publication to some\n            person who by his interest or personal position was fitted for the task. The names of\n            Theopompus and Xenophon are evidently mentioned only because each of them was known to\n            have continued the history of Thucydides. Theopompus, indeed, could have been hardly\n            born at the time of the death of Thucydides. As to Xenophon, we read in Diog. Laert.\n              , . This statement that Xenophon made known to fame the books of\n            Thucydides when he might have suppressed them, may suggest that they were intrusted to\n            him by the historian's daughter: but to treat this as an established fact is to go too\n            far; yet Letronne\n            has done this when, assuming that Xenophon could have published the history of\n            Thucydides only before his own expedition to Asia in 400, he fancies that he has thus\n            secured a fixed limit for the life of Thucydides.

(2)  refers\n            to what are commonly called , i.e.\n            commercial treaties originally made between independent states, in accordance with which\n            disputes in matters of trade  (ex contractu) were decided upon certain\n            fixed rules in the courts of the defendant's city. As Athens had no doubt such treaties\n            with many of her allies before their subjection to tribute, there is no reason to\n            suppose they were abrogated after that change in their political status. (3)  refers to the compulsory jurisdiction which\n            Athens enforced upon her allies in her own courts in suits arising ex delicto between\n            Athenians and citizens of subject states, and also between citizens of subject states by\n            way of appeal, when the sentence in the local court was either death, exile, or\n            disfranchisement. Probably it soon came to pass that the more important of such cases\n            were brought to Athenian courts in the first instance. (4)  does not agree with  but\n            means  for the allies. The passage may be thus\n            paraphrased: For even though we exact less than our power would justify in\n            cases decided under commercial treaties made with our allies, and though we have\n            established for them trials in our own courts on the basis of impartial laws for us and\n            them, we are thought to be litigious.
