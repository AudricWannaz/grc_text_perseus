Across Gorgopus' water shot the light, reached the mount of Aegiplanctus, and urged the ordinance of fire to make no delay.Kindling high with unstinted force a mighty beard of flame, they sped it forward so that, as it blazed, it passed even the headland that looks upon the Saronic gulf; until it swooped down when it reached the lookout, near to our city, upon the peak of Arachnaeus; andnext upon this roof of the Atreidae it leapt, this very fire not undescended from the Idaean flame."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "314", "@resp": "Smyth", "#text": "The light kindled on Mt.

Ourselves, however, and our ship, its hull unshattered, some power, divine not human, preserved by stealth or intercession, laying hand upon its helm; and Savior Fortune chose to sit aboard our craftso that it should neither take in the swelling surf at anchorage nor drive upon a rock-bound coast.  Then, having escaped death upon the deep, in the clear bright day, scarce crediting our fortune, we brooded in anxious thought over our late mischance,our fleet distressed and sorely buffeted.  So now, if any of them still draw the breath of life, they speak of us as lostand why should they not? We think the same of them.  But may all turn out for the best!  For Menelaus, indeed;first and foremost expect him to return.
