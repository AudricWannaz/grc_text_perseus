I hold that it is also necessary to know which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiseased states arise from powers and which from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstructures. What I mean is roughly that a \"power\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis an intensity and strength of the humours, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"structures\" are the conformations to be found in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe human body, some of which are hollow, tapering\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom wide to narrow ; some are expanded, some\n\t\t\t\t\t\thard and round, some broad and suspended, some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstretched, some long, some close in texture, some loose\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin texture and fleshy, some spongy and porous. Now\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich structure is best adapted to draw and attract\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto itself fluid from the rest of the body, the hollow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand expanded, the hard and round, or the hollow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand tapering? I take it that the best adapted is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe broad hollow that tapers. One should learn this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthoroughly from unenclosed objects that can be"}, "seen. For example, if you open the mouth wide\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou will draw in no fluid ; but if you protrude and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontract it, compressing the lips, and then insert\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta tube, you can easily draw up any liquid you wish.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAgain, cupping instruments, which are broad and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttapering, are so constructed on purpose to draw and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattract blood from the flesh. There are many other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstruments of a similar nature. Of the parts within\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe human frame, the bladder, the head, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twomb are of this structure. These obviously attract\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpowerfully, and are always full of a fluid from without.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHollow and expanded parts are especially\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadapted for receiving fluid that has flowed into them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut are not so suited for attraction. Round solids\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill neither attract fluid nor receive it when it has\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflowed into them, for it would slip round and find no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace on which to rest. Spongy, porous parts, like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe spleen, lungs and breasts, will drink up readily\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat is in contact with them, and these parts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially harden and enlarge on the addition of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfluid. They will not be evacuated every day, as are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbowels, where the fluid is inside, while the bowels\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves contain it externally ; but when one of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese parts drinks up the fluid and takes it to itself,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe porous hollows, even the small ones, are every-where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfilled, and the soft, porous part becomes hard\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand close, and neither digests nor discharges. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappens because of the nature of its structure. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\twind and flatulence are produced in the body, the", "rumbling noise naturally occurs in the hollow, broad\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparts, such as the bowels and the chest. For when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe flatulence does not fill a part so as to be at rest,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut moves and changes its position, it cannot be but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat thereby noise and perceptible movements take\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace. In soft, fleshy parts occur numbness and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobstructions, such as happen in apoplexy. And when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflatulence meets a broad, resisting body, and rushes\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton it, and this happens by nature to be neither strong\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso as to endure its violence without harm, nor soft\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand porous so as to give way and admit it, but tender,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfleshy, full of blood, and close, like the liver, because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit is close and broad it resists without yielding, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe flatulence being checked increases and becomes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstronger, dashing violently against the obstacle. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\towing to its tenderness and the blood it contains,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe part cannot be free from pain, and this is why\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sharpest and most frequent pains occur in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregion, and abscesses and tumours are very common.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tViolent pain, but much less severe, is also felt under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe diaphragm. For the diaphragm is an extended,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbroad and resisting substance, of a stronger and more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsinewy texture, and so there is less pain.

Such are the facts about spring waters. I\n\t\t\t\t\twill now proceed to speak of rain water and snow\n\t\t\t\t\twater. Rain waters are the lightest, sweetest, finest\n\t\t\t\t\tand clearest. To begin with, the sun raises and draws\n\t\t\t\t\tup the finest and lightest part of water, as is proved\n\t\t\t\t\tby the formation of salt. The brine, owing to its\n\t\t\t\t\tcoarseness and weight, is left behind and becomes\n\t\t\t\t\tsalt ; the finest part, owing to its lightness, is drawn\n\t\t\t\t\tup by the sun. Not only from pools does the sun\n\t\t\t\t\traise this part, but also from the sea and from\n\t\t\t\t\twhatever has moisture in it--and there is moisture\n\t\t\t\t\tin everything. Even from men it raises the finest\n\t\t\t\t\tand lightest part of their juices. The plainest\n\t\t\t\t\tevidence thereof is that when a man walks or sits\n\t\t\t\t\tin the sun wearing a cloak, the parts of his skin\n\t\t\t\t\treached by the sun will not sweat, for it draws up\n\t\t\t\t\teach layer of sweat as it appears. But those parts\n\t\t\t\t\tsweat which are covered by his cloak or by anything\n\t\t\t\t\telse. For the sweat drawn forcibly out by the\n\t\t\t\t\tsun is prevented by the covering from disappearing\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough the sun's power. But when the man has\n\t\t\t\t\tcome into a shady place, his whole body sweats\n\t\t\t\t\talike, as the sun no longer shines upon it. For this\n\t\t\t\t\treason too rain-water grows foul quicker than any\n\t\t\t\t\tother, and has a bad smell ; being a mixture gathered\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom very many sources it grows foul very quickly.\n\t\t\t\t\tFurthermore, when it has been carried away aloft, and\n\t\t\t\t\thas combined with the atmosphere as it circles round,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe turbid, dark part of it separates out, changes\n\t\t\t\t\tand becomes mist and fog, while the clearest and", {"note": ["The reading of Khlewein means,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"condensed, set in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmotion and carried along by a wind, are suddenly,\" etc.", "Or, with the reading of Coray, \"filtered.\""], "#text": "lightest part of it remains, and is sweetened as the\n\t\t\t\t\t\theat of the sun produces coction, just as all other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings always become sweeter through coction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow as long as it is scattered and uncondensed, it\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttravels about aloft, but as soon as it collects anywhere\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand is compressed into one place owing to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsudden, contrary winds, then it bursts wherever the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost compression happens to take place.

This, or something very like this, is the truth\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerning these matters. As to the seasons, a\n\t\t\t\t\tconsideration of the following points will make it\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible to decide whether the year will prove\n\t\t\t\t\tunhealthy or healthy. If the signs prove normal\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the stars set and rise ; if there be rains in\n\t\t\t\t\tautumn, if the winter be moderate, neither too mild\n\t\t\t\t\tnor unseasonably cold, and if the rains be seasonable\n\t\t\t\t\tin spring and in summer, the year is likely to be\n\t\t\t\t\tvery healthy. If, on the other hand, the winter\n\t\t\t\t\tprove dry and northerly, the spring rainy and\n\t\t\t\t\tsoutherly, the summer cannot fail to be feverladen,\n\t\t\t\t\tcausing ophthalmia and dysenteries. For\n\t\t\t\t\twhenever the great heat comes on suddenly while\n\t\t\t\t\tthe earth is soaked by reason of the spring rains\n\t\t\t\t\tand the south wind, the heat cannot fail to be\n\t\t\t\t\tdoubled, coming from the hot, sodden earth and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe burning sun ; men's bowels not being braced\n\t\t\t\t\tnor their brain dried--for when spring is such\n\t\t\t\t\tthe body and its flesh must necessarily be flabby--the\n\t\t\t\t\tfevers that attack are of the acutest type in\n\t\t\t\t\tall cases, especially among the phlegmatic. Dysenteries\n\t\t\t\t\tare also likely to come upon women and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe most humid constitutions. If at the rising\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Dog Star stormy rain occurs and the\n\t\t\t\t\tEtesian winds blow, there is hope that the distempers\n\t\t\t\t\twill cease and that the autumn will be\n\t\t\t\t\thealthy.

But if the winter be southerly, rainy and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmild, and the spring be northerly, dry and wintry,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the first place women with child whose delivery\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis due by spring suffer abortion ; and if they do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbring forth, their children are weak and sickly,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso that either they die at once, or live puny, weak\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand sickly. Such is the fate of the women. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers have dysenteries and dry ophthalmia, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin some cases catarrhs descend from the head to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe lungs. Phlegmatics are liable to dysenteries,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand women also, phlegm running down from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrain because of the humidity of their constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe bilious have dry ophthalmia because of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twarm dryness of their flesh.

As soon as a child is born\n\t\t\t\t\tthey remodel its head with their hands, while it\n\t\t\t\t\tis still soft and the body tender, and force it to\n\t\t\t\t\tincrease in length by applying bandages and suitable\n\t\t\t\t\tappliances, which spoil the roundness of the\n\t\t\t\t\thead and increase its length. Custom originally so\n\t\t\t\t\tacted that through force such a nature came into\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing ; but as time went on the process became\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural, so that custom no longer exercised compulsion.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the seed comes from all parts of the\n\t\t\t\t\tbody, healthy seed from healthy parts, diseased seed\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom diseased parts.
