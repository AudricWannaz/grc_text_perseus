But to go still further back, I hold that the diet and food\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich people in health now use would not have been discovered, provided\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit had suited with man to eat and drink in like manner as the ox,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe horse, and all other animals, except man, do of the productions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the earth, such as fruits, weeds, and grass; for from such things\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese animals grow, live free of disease, and require no other kind\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof food. And, at first, I am of opinion that man used the same sort\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof food, and that the present articles of diet had been discovered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand invented only after a long lapse of time, for when they suffered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch and severely from strong and brutish diet, swallowing things\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich were raw, unmixed, and possessing great strength, they became\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposed to strong pains and diseases, and to early deaths. It is likely,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindeed, that from habit they would suffer less from these things then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan we would now, but still they would suffer severely even then;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand it is likely that the greater number, and those who had weaker\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstitutions, would all perish; whereas the stronger would hold out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a longer time, as even nowadays some, in consequence of using\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrong articles of food, get off with little trouble, but others with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch pain and suffering. From this necessity it appears to me that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey would search out the food befitting their nature, and thus discover\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat which we now use: and that from wheat, by macerating it, stripping\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit of its hull, grinding it all down, sifting, toasting, and baking\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, they formed bread; and from barley they formed cake (maza), performing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany operations in regard to it; they boiled, they roasted, they mixed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey diluted those things which are strong and of intense qualities\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith weaker things, fashioning them to the nature and powers of man,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand considering that the stronger things Nature would not be able\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto manage if administered, and that from such things pains, diseases,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand death would arise, but such as Nature could manage, that from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem food, growth, and health, would arise. To such a discovery and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestigation what more suitable name could one give than that of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMedicine? since it was discovered for the health of man, for his nourishment\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand safety, as a substitute for that kind of diet by which pains,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiseases, and deaths were occasioned."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "4", "head": "PART 4", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "p.4"}, "#text": "And if this is not held to be an art, I do not object.

And these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings operate thus both upon men in health and in disease. For example,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif a person in health wishes to cool his body during winter, and bathes\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither in cold water or in any other way, the more he does this, unless\n\t\t\t\t\t\this body be fairly congealed, when he resumes his clothes and comes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto a place of shelter, his body becomes more heated than before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd thus, too, if a person wish to be warmed thoroughly either by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeans of a hot bath or strong fire, and straight-way having the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclothing on, takes up his abode again in the place he was in when\n\t\t\t\t\t\the became congealed, he will appear much colder, and more disposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto chills than before. And if a person fan himself on account of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffocating heat, and having procured refrigeration for himself in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis manner, cease doing so, the heat and suffocation will be ten\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttimes greater in his case than in that of a person who does nothing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the kind. And, to give a more striking example, persons travelling\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the snow, or otherwise in rigorous weather, and contracting great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcold in their feet, their hands, or their head, what do they not suffer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom inflammation and tingling when they put on warm clothing and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tget into a hot place? In some instances, blisters arise as if from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburning with fire, and they do not suffer from any of those unpleasant\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsymptoms until they become heated. So readily does either of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpass into the other; and I could mention many other examples.

What do I mean\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby this? By powers, I mean intense and strong juices; and by structures,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhatever conformations there are in man. For some are hollow, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom broad contracted into narrow; some expanded, some hard and round,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome broad and suspended, some stretched, some long, some dense, some\n\t\t\t\t\t\trare and succulent, some spongy and of loose texture. Now, then, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof these figures is the best calculated to suck to itself and attract\n\t\t\t\t\t\thumidity from another body? Whether what is hollow and expanded, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat is solid and round, or what is hollow, and from broad, gradually\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturning narrow? I think such as from hollow and broad are contracted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto narrow: this may be ascertained otherwise from obvious facts:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthus, if you gape wide with the mouth you cannot draw in any liquid;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut by protruding, contracting, and compressing the lips, and still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore by using a tube, you can readily draw in whatever you wish. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthus, too, the instruments which are used for cupping are broad below\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand gradually become narrow, and are so con-structed in order to suck\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand draw in from the fleshy parts. The nature and construction of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe parts within a man are of a like nature; the bladder, the head,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe uterus in woman; these parts clearly attract, and are always filled\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith a juice which is foreign to them. Those parts which are hollow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand expanded are most likely to receive any humidity flowing into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, but cannot attract it in like manner. Those parts which are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsolid and round could not attract a humidity, nor receive it when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit flows to them, for it would glide past, and find no place of rest\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton them. But spongy and rare parts, such as the spleen, the lungs,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the breasts, drink up especially the juices around them, and become\n\t\t\t\t\t\thardened and enlarged by the accession of juices. Such things happen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto these organs especially. For it is not with the spleen as with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe stomach, in which there is a liquid, which it contains and evacuates\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevery day; but when it (the spleen) drinks up and receives a fluid\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto itself, the hollow and lax parts of it are filled, even the small\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterstices; and, instead of being rare and soft, it becomes hard\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand dense, and it can neither digest nor discharge its contents: these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings it suffers, owing to the nature of its structure. Those things\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich engender flatulence or tormina in the body, naturally do so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the hollow and broad parts of the body, such as the stomach and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchest, where they produce rumbling noises; for when they do not fill\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe parts so as to be stationary, but have changes of place and movements,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere must necessarily be noise and apparent movements from them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut such parts as are fleshy and soft, in these there occur torpor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand obstructions, such as happen in apoplexy. But when it (the flatus?)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencounters a broad and resisting structure, and rushes against such\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta part, and this happens when it is by nature not strong so as to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe able to withstand it without suffering injury; nor soft and rare,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso as to receive or yield to it, but tender, juicy, full of blood,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand dense, like the liver, owing to its density and broadness, it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresists and does not yield. But flatus, when it obtains admission,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreases and becomes stronger, and rushes toward any resisting object;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut owing to its tenderness, and the quantity of blood which it (the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliver) contains, it cannot be without uneasiness; and for these reasons\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe most acute and frequent pains  occur in the region of it, along\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith suppurations and chronic tumors (phymata). These symptoms also\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccur in the site of the diaphragm, but much less frequently; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe diaphragm is a broad, expanded, and resisting substance, of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnervous (tendinous?) and strong nature, and therefore less susceptible\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof pain; and yet pains and chronic abscesses do occur about it."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "23", "head": "PART 23", "p": "There are both within and without the body many other kinds of structure,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich differ much from one another as to sufferings both in health\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand disease; such as whether the head be small or large; the neck\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslender or thick, long or short; the belly long or round; the chest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ribs broad or narrow; and many others besides, all which you ought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be acquainted with, and their differences; so that knowing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcauses of each, you may make the more accurate observations."}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "24", "head": "PART 24", "p": "And, as has been formerly stated, one ought to be acquainted with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe powers of juices, and what action each of them has upon man, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir alliances towards one another.

These are the diseases which attack them in summer; but in\n\t\t\t\t\t\twinter younger persons are liable to pneumonia, and maniacal affections;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand older persons to ardent fevers, from hardness of the belly. Women\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare subject to oedema and leucophlegmasiae; when pregnant they have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult deliveries; their infants are large and swelled, and then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring nursing they become wasted and sickly, and the lochial discharge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter parturition does not proceed properly with the women. The children\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare particularly subject to hernia, and adults to varices and ulcers\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton their legs, so that persons with such constitutions cannot be long-lived,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut before the usual period they fall into a state of premature old\n\t\t\t\t\t\tage. And further, the women appear to be with child, and when the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime of parturition arrives, the fulness of the belly disappears,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand this happens from dropsy of the uterus. Such waters then I reckon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbad for every purpose. The next to them in badness are those which\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave their fountains in rocks, so that they must necessarily be hard,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor come from a soil which produces thermal waters, such as those having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiron,  copper, silver, gold, sulphur, alum, bitumen, or nitre (soda)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin them; for all these are formed by the force of heat. Good waters\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcannot proceed from such a soil, but those that are hard and of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\theating nature, difficult to pass by urine, and of difficult evacuation\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the bowels. The best are those which flow from elevated grounds,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand hills of earth; these are sweet, clear, and can bear a little\n\t\t\t\t\t\twine; they are hot in summer and cold in winter, for such necessarily\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmust be the waters from deep wells. But those are most to be commended\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich run to the rising of the sun, and especially to the summer sun;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor such are necessarily more clear, fragrant, and light. But all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch as are salty, crude, and harsh, are not good for drink. But there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare certain constitutions and diseases with which such waters agree\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen drunk, as I will explain presently. Their characters are as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe best are such as have their fountains to the east; the next, those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween the summer risings and settings of the sun, and especially\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose to the risings; and third, those between the summer and winter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsettings; but the worst are those to the south, and the parts between\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe winter rising and setting, and those to the south are very bad,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut those to the north are better. They are to be used as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhoever is in good health and strength need not mind, but may always\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrink whatever is at hand. But whoever wishes to drink the most suitable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor any disease, may accomplish his purpose by attending to the following\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections: To persons whose bellies are hard and easily burnt up,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sweetest, the lightest, and the most limpid waters will be proper;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut those persons whose bellies are soft, loose, and pituitous, should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchoose the hardest, those kinds that are most crude, and the saltiest,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor thus will they be most readily dried up; for such waters as are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadapted for boiling, and are of a very solvent nature, naturally loosen\n\t\t\t\t\t\treadily and melt down the bowels; but such as are intractable, hard,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand by no means proper for boiling, these rather bind and dry up the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbowels. People have deceived themselves with regard to salt waters,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom inexperience, for they think these waters purgative, whereas\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey are the very reverse; for such waters are crude, and ill adapted  for boiling, so that the belly is more likely to be bound up than\n\t\t\t\t\t\tloosened by them. And thus it is with regard to the waters of springs."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "8", "head": "PART 8", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "p.27"}, "#text": "I will now tell how it is with respect to rain-water, and water from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsnow. Rain waters, then, are the lightest, the sweetest, the thinnest,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the clearest; for originally the sun raises and attracts the thinnest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand lightest part of the water, as is obvious from the nature of salts;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the saltish part is left behind owing to its thickness and weight,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand forms salts; but the sun attracts the thinnest part, owing to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits lightness, and he abstracts this not only from the lakes, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso from the sea, and from all things which contain humidity, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is humidity in everything; and from man himself the sun draws\n\t\t\t\t\t\toff the thinnest and lightest part of the juices. As a strong proof\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof this, when a man walks in the sun, or sits down having a garment\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton, whatever parts of the body the sun shines upon do not sweat, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sun carries off whatever sweat makes its appearance; but those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparts which are covered by the garment, or anything else, sweat, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe particles of sweat are drawn and forced out by the sun, and are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreserved by the cover so as not to be dissipated by the sun; but\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the person comes into the shade the whole body equally perspires,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause the sun no longer shines upon it. Wherefore, of all kinds\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof water, these spoil the soonest; and rain water has a bad spot smell,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause its particles are collected and mixed together from most objects,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso as to spoil the soonest. And in addition to this, when attracted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand raised up, being carried about and mixed with the air, whatever\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart of it is turbid and darkish is separated and removed from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother, and becomes cloud and mist, but the most attenuated and lightest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart is left, and becomes sweet, being heated and concocted by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsun, for all other things when concocted become sweet. While dissipated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen and not in a state of consistence it is carried aloft. But when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollected and condensed by contrary winds, it falls down wherever\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit happens to be most condensed. For this is likely to happen when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe clouds being carried along and moving with a wind which does not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallow them to rest, suddenly encounters another wind and other clouds\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the opposite direction: there it is first condensed, and what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis behind is carried up to the spot, and thus it thickens, blackens,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand is conglomerated, and by its weight it falls down and becomes\n\t\t\t\t\t\train. Such, to all appearance, are the best of waters, but they require\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be boiled and strained; for otherwise they have a bad smell, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccasion hoarseness and thickness of the voice to those who drink\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. Those from snow and ice are all bad, for when once congealed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey never again recover their former nature; for whatever is clear,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlight, and sweet in them, is separated and disappears; but the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturbid and weightiest part is left behind. You may ascertain this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the following manner: If in winter you will pour water by measure\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto a vessel and expose it to the open air until it is all frozen,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand then on the following day bring it into a warm situation where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ice will thaw, if you will measure the water again when dissolved\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou will find it much less in quantity. This is a proof that the lightest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand thinnest part is dissipated and dried up by the congelation, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot the heaviest and thickest, for that is impossible: wherefore I\n\t\t\t\t\t\thold that waters from snow and ice, and those allied to them, are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe worst of any for all purposes whatever. Such are the characters\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof rain-water, and those from ice and snow."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "9", "head": "PART 9", "p": {"note": ["This is a most interesting chapter, as containing the most ancient observations which we possess on the important subject of urinary calculi.

For it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis impossible that such waters can resemble one another, but one kind\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis sweet, another saltish and aluminous, and some flow from thermal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsprings; and these being all mixed up together disagree, and the strongest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart always prevails; but the same kind is not always the strongest,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut sometimes one and sometimes another, according to the winds, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe north wind imparts strength to this water, and the south to that,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand so also with regard to the others. There must be deposits of mud\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand sand in the vessels from such waters, and the aforesaid diseases\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmust be engendered by them when drunk, but why not to all I will now\n\t\t\t\t\t\texplain. When the bowels are loose and in a healthy state, and when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bladder is not hot, nor the neck of the bladder very contracted,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall such persons pass water freely, and no concretion forms in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbladder; but those in whom the belly is hot, the bladder must be in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same condition; and when preternaturally heated, its neck becomes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflamed; and when these things happen, the bladder does not expel\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe urine, but raises its heat excessively. And the thinnest part\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof it is secreted, and the purest part is passed off in the form of\n\t\t\t\t\t\turine, but the thickest and most turbid part is condensed and concreted,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat first in small quantity, but afterwards in greater; for being rolled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout in the urine, whatever is of a thick consistence it assimilates\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto itself, and thus it increases and becomes indurated. And when such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons make water, the stone forced down by the urine falls into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe neck of the bladder and stops the urine, and occasions intense\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpain; so that calculous children rub their privy parts and tear at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, as supposing that the obstruction to the urine is situated there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a proof that it is as I say, persons affected with calculus have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery limpid urine, because the thickest and foulest part remains and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis concreted. Thus it generally is in cases of calculus. It forms\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso in children from milk, when it is not wholesome, but very hot\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand bilious, for it heats the bowels and bladder, so that the urine\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing also heated undergoes the same change. And I hold that it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter to give children only the most diluted wine, for such will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleast burn up and dry the veins. Calculi do not form so readily in\n\t\t\t\t\t\twomen, for in them the urethra is short and wide, so that in them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe urine is easily expelled; neither do they rub the pudendum with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir hands, nor handle  the passage like males; for the urethra in\n\t\t\t\t\t\twomen opens direct into the pudendum, which is not the case with men,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneither in them is the urethra so wide, and they drink more than children\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo.

But if the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twinter be dry and northerly, and the spring showery and southerly,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe summer will necessarily be of a febrile character, and give rise\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto ophthalmies and dysenteries. For when suffocating heat sets in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall of a sudden, while the earth is moistened by the vernal showers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand by the south wind, the heat is necessarily doubled from the earth,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich is thus soaked by rain and heated by a burning sun, while, at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same time, men's bellies are not in an orderly state, nor the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrain properly dried; for it is impossible, after such a spring, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the body and its flesh must be loaded with humors, so that very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacute fevers will attack all, but especially those of a phlegmatic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconstitution. Dysenteries are also likely to occur to women and those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof a very humid temperament. And if at the rising of the Dogstar rain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand wintery storms supervene, and if the etesian winds blow, there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis reason to hope that these diseases will cease, and that the autumn\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill be healthy; but if not, it is likely to be a fatal season to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchildren and women, but least of all to old men; and that convalescents\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill pass into quartans, and from quartans into dropsies; but if the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twinter be southerly, showery and mild, but the spring northerly, dry,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand of a wintry character, in the first place women who happen to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe with child, and whose accouchement should take place in spring,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare apt to miscarry; and such as bring forth, have feeble and sickly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchildren, so that they either die presently or are tender, feeble,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand sickly, if they live. Such is the case with the women. The others\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare subject to dysenteries and dry ophthalmies, and some have catarrhs\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeginning in the head and descending to the lungs. Men of a phlegmatic\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttemperament are likely to have dysenteries; and women, also, from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe humidity of their nature, the phlegm descending downwards from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe brain; those who are bilious, too, have dry ophthalmies from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\theat and dryness of their flesh; the aged, too, have catarrhs from\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir flabbiness and melting of the veins, so that some of them die\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuddenly and some become paralytic on the right side or the left.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor when, the winter being southerly and the body hot, the blood and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tveins are not properly constringed; a spring that is northerly, dry,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand cold, having come on, the brain when it should have been expanded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand purged, by the coryza and hoarseness is then constringed and contracted,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso that the summer and the heat occurring suddenly, and a change supervening,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese diseases fall out. And such cities as lie well to the sun and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twinds, and use good waters, feel these changes less, but such as use\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarshy and pooly waters, and lie well both as regards the winds and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sun, these all feel it more.

And if the summer be rainy and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoutherly, and next the autumn, the winter must, of necessity, be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsickly, and ardent fevers are likely to attack those that are phlegmatic,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand more elderly than forty years, and pleurisies and peripneumonies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose that are bilious.

To\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttreat of all would be a long story, but I will tell you how I think\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit is with regard to the greatest and most marked differences. I say,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen, that Asia differs very much from Europe as to the nature of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall things, both with regard to the productions of the earth and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinhabitants, for everything is produced much more beautiful and large\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Asia; the country is milder, and the dispositions of the inhabitants\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso are more gentle and affectionate.

For neither are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey much burnt up by the heat, nor dried up by the drought and want\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof rain, nor do they suffer from the cold; since they are well watered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom abundant showers and snow, and the fruits of the season, as might\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe supposed, grow in abundance, both such as are raised from seed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat has been sown, and such plants as the earth produces of its own\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccord, the fruits of which the inhabitants make use of, training\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem from their wild state and transplanting them to a suitable soil;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cattle also which are reared there are vigorous, particularly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprolific, and bring up young of the fairest description; the inhabitants\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoo, are well fed, most beautiful in shape, of large stature, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiffer little from one another either as to figure or size; and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry itself, both as regards its constitution and mildness of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseasons, may be said to bear a close resemblance to the spring.

The inhabitants of the country attribute the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir impotence to a god, and venerate and worship such persons, every\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone dreading that the like might befall himself; but to me it appears\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat such affections are just as much divine as all others are, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat no one disease is either more divine or more human than another,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut that all are alike divine, for that each has its own nature, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat no one arises without a natural cause. But I will explain how\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think that the affection takes its rise. From continued exercise\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton horseback they are seized with chronic defluxions in their joints\n\t\t\t\t\t\towing to their legs always hanging down below their horses; they afterwards\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecome lame and stiff at the hip-joint, such of them, at least, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare severely attacked with it. They treat themselves in this way:\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the disease is commencing, they open the vein behind either ear,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand when the blood flows, sleep, from feebleness, seizes them, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafterwards they awaken, some in good health and others not. To me\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit appears that the semen is altered by this treatment, for there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare veins behind the ears which, if cut, induce impotence; now, these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tveins would appear to me to be cut. Such persons afterwards, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey go in to women and cannot have connection with them, at first\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo not think much about it, but remain quiet; but when, after making\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe attempt two, three, or more times, they succeed no better, fancying\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey have committed some offence against the god whom they blame for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe affection, they put on female attire, reproach themselves for\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffeminacy, play the part of women, and perform the same work as women\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo.

But\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit attacks other men in like manner, for whenever men ride much and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery frequently on horseback, then many are affected with rheums in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe joints, sciatica, and gout, and they are inept at venery. But\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese complaints befall the Scythians, and they are the most impotent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof men for the aforesaid causes, and because they always wear breeches,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand spend the most of their time on horseback, so as not to touch\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir privy parts with the hands, and from the cold and fatigue they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforget the sexual desire, and do not make the attempt until after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey have lost their virility.

Yet one must much less resort to augmentation, since\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit is often beneficial to have recourse to abstraction, when the patient\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcan bear it, until the disease having reached its acme and has become\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcocted.

For some at the commencement of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacute diseases have taken food on the same day, some on the next day;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome have swallowed whatever has come in their way, and some have\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaken . Now all these things are worse than if one had observed\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta different regimen; and yet these mistakes, committed at that time,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo much less injury than if one were to abstain entirely from food\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the first two or three days, and on the fourth or fifth day were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto take such food; and it would be still worse, if one were to observe\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttotal abstinence for all these days, and on the following days were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto take such a diet, before the disease is concocted; for in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway death would be the consequence to most people, unless the disease\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere of a very mild nature. But the mistakes committed at first were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot so irremediable as these, but could be much more easily repaired.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis, therefore, I think a strong proof that such or such a draught\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneed not be prescribed on the first days to those who will use the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame draughts afterwards. At the bottom, therefore, they do not know,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneither those using unstrained ptisans, that they are hurt by them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen they begin to swallow them, if they abstain entirely from food\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor two, three, or more days; nor do those using the juice know that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey are injured in swallowing them, when they do not commence with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe draught seasonably. But this they guard against, and know that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit does much mischief, if, before the disease be concocted, the patient\n\t\t\t\t\t\tswallow unstrained ptisan, when accustomed to use strained. All these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings are strong proofs that physicians do not conduct the regimen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof patients properly, but that in those diseases in which total abstinence\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom food should not be enforced on patients that will be put on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuse of ptisans, they do enforce total abstinence; that in those cases\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin which there should be no change made from total abstinence to ptisans,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey do make the change; and that, for the most part, they change\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom abstinence to ptisans, exactly at the time when it is often beneficial\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto proceed from ptisans almost to total abstinence, if the disease\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappen to be in the state of exacerbation. And sometimes crude matters\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare attracted from the head, and bilious from the region near the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchest, and the patients are attacked with insomnolency, so that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisease is not concocted; they become sorrowful, peevish, and delirious;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere are flashes of light in their eyes, and noises in their ears;\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir extremities are cold, their urine unconcocted; the sputa thin,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaltish, tinged with an intense color and smell; sweats about the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneck, and anxiety; respiration, interrupted in the expulsion of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tair, frequent and very large; expression of the eyelids dreadful;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdangerous ; tossing of the bed-clothes from the breast; the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thands trembling, and sometimes the lower lip agitated. These symptoms,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappearing at the commencement, are indicative of strong delirium,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand patients so affected generally die, or if they escape, it is with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta deposit, hemorrhage from the nose, or the expectoration of thick\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatter, and not otherwise. Neither do I perceive that physicians are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tskilled in such things as these; how they ought to know such diseases\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas are connected with debility, and which are further weakened by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabstinence from food, and those aggravated by some other irritation;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose by pain, and from the acute nature of the disease, and what\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffections and various forms thereof our constitution and habit engender,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough the knowledge or ignorance of such things brings safety or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath to the patient. For it is a great mischief if to a patient debilitated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby pain, and the acute nature of the disease, one administer drink,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor more ptisan, or food, supposing that the debility proceeds from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinanition. It is also disgraceful not to recognize a patient whose\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebility is connected with inanition, and to pinch him in his diet;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis mistake, indeed, is attended with some danger, but much less\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan the other, and yet it is likely to expose one to much greater\n\t\t\t\t\t\tderision, for if another physician, or a private person, coming in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand knowing what has happened, should give to eat or drink those things\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich the other had forbidden, the benefit thus done to the patient\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be manifest. Such mistakes of practitioners are particularly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tridiculed by mankind, for the physician or nonprofessional man thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoming in, seems as it were to resuscitate the dead.

Hydromel is also moderately diuretic, unless\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevented by the state of any of the viscera. And it also occasions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbilious discharges downwards, sometimes of a proper character, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsometimes more intense and frothy than is suitable; but such rather\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccurs in persons who are bilious, and have enlarged viscera. Hydromel\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather produces expectoration, and softening of the lungs, when given\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiluted with water. But unmixed hydromel, rather than the diluted,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduces frothy evacuations, such as are unseasonably and intensely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbilious, and too hot; but such an evacuation occasions other great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmischiefs, for it neither extinguishes the heat in the hypochondria,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut rouses it, induces inquietude, and jactitation of the limbs, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tulcerates the intestines and anus. The remedies for all these will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe described afterwards. By using hydromel without ptisans, instead\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof any other drink, you will generally succeed in the treatment of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch diseases, and fail in few cases; but in what instances it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be given, and in what it is not to be given, and wherefore it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot to be given,- all this has been explained already, for the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart. Hydromel is generally condemned, as if it weakened the powers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof those who drink it, and on that account it is supposed to accelerate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath; and this opinion arose from persons who starve themselves to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath, some of whom use hydromel alone for drink, as fancying that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit really has this effect. But this is by no means always the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor hydromel, if drunk alone, is much stronger than water, if it do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot disorder the bowels; but in some respects it is stronger, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin some weaker, than wine that is thin, weak, and devoid of .\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is a great difference between unmixed wine and unmixed honey,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas to their nutritive powers, for if a man will drink double the quantity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof pure wine, to a certain quantity of honey which is swallowed, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill find himself much stronger from the honey, provided it do not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisagree with his bowels, and that his alvine evacuations from it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill be much more copious. But if he shall use ptisan for a draught,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand drink afterward hydromel, he will feel full, flatulent, and uncomfortable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the viscera of the hypochondrium; but if the hydromel be taken\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore the draught, it will not have the same injurious effects as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif taken after it, but will be rather beneficial. And boiled hydromel\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas a much more elegant appearance than the unboiled, being clear,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthin, white, and transparent, but I am unable to mention any good\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquality which it possesses that the other wants. For it is not sweeter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan the unboiled, provided the honey be fine, and it is weaker, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccasions less copious evacuations of the bowels, neither of which\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffects is required from the hydromel. But one should by all means\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuse it boiled, provided the honey be bad, impure, black, and not fragrant,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the boiling will remove the most of its bad qualities and appearances."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "16", "head": "PART 16", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "p.77"}, {"@id": "p.78"}], "#text": "You will find the drink, called oxymel, often very useful in these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomplaints, for it promotes expectoration and freedom of breathing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe following are the proper occasions for administering it. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrongly acid it has no mean operation in rendering the expectoration\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore easy, for by bringing up the sputa, which occasion troublesome\n\t\t\t\t\t\thawking, and rendering them more slippery, and, as it were, clearing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe windpipe with a feather, it relieves the lungs and proves emollient\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto them; and when it succeeds in producing these effects it must do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch good.

It may suit well to drink a little of this at night before\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe draught of ptisan, and when a considerable interval of time has\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassed after the draught there will be nothing to prevent its being\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaken. But to those who are restricted entirely to drinks without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdraughts of ptisan, it will therefore not be proper at all times to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgive it, more especially from the fretting and irritation of the intestine\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich it occasions, (and these bad effects it will be the more apt\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto produce provided there be no faeces in the intestines and the patient\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis laboring under inanition,) and then it will weaken the powers of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe hydromel. But if it appears advantageous to use a great deal of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis drink during the whole course of the disease, one should add\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto it merely as much vinegar as can just be perceived by the taste,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor thus what is prejudicial in it will do the least possible harm,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand what is beneficial will do the more good.

But the head should be rubbed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the sponge until it is quite dry; the extremities should be protected\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom cold, as also the head and the rest of the body; and a man should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot be washed immediately after he has taken a draught of ptisan or\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta drink; neither should he take ptisan as a drink immediately after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bath. Much will depend upon whether the patient, when in good\n\t\t\t\t\t\thealth, was very fond of the bath, and in the custom of taking it:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor such persons, especially, feel the want of it, and are benefited\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif they are bathed, and injured if they are not. In general it suits\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter with cases of pneumonia than in ardent fevers; for the bath\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoothes the pain in the side, chest, and back; concocts the sputa,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromotes expectoration, improves the respiration, and allays lassitude;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor it soothes the joints and outer skin, and is diuretic, removes\n\t\t\t\t\t\theaviness of the head, and moistens the nose. Such are the benefits\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be derived from the bath, if all the proper requisites be present;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut if one or more of these be wanting, the bath, instead of doing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood, may rather prove injurious; for every one of them may do harm\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif not prepared by the attendants in the proper manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is by no means a suitable thing in these diseases to persons whose\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbowels are too loose, or when they are unusually confined, and there\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas been no previous evacuation; neither must we bathe those who are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdebilitated, nor such as have nausea or vomiting, or bilious eructations;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnor such as have hemorrhage from the nose, unless it be less than\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequired at that stage of the disease (with those stages you are acquainted),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut if the discharge be less than proper, one should use the bath,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhether in order to benefit the whole body or the head alone. If then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe proper requisites be at hand, and the patient be well disposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the bath, it may be administered once every day, or if the patient\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe fond of the bath there will be no harm, though he should take it\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwice in the day. The use of the bath is much more appropriate to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who take unstrained ptisan, than to those who take only the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjuice of it, although even in their case it may be proper; but least\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof all does it suit with those who use only plain drink, although,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin their case too it may be suitable; but one must form a judgment\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the rules laid down before, in which of these modes of regimen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bath will be beneficial, and in which not. Such as want some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe requisites for a proper bath, but have those symptoms which would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe benefited by it, should be bathed; whereas those who want none\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the proper requisites, but have certain symptoms which contraindicate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bath, are not to be bathed."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "appendix", "head": "APPENDIX", "div3": [{"@type": "part", "@n": "1", "head": "PART 1", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "p.81"}, "#text": "Ardent fever (causus) takes place when the veins, being dried up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the summer season, attract acrid and bilious humors to themselves;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand strong fever seizes the whole body, which experiences aches of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bones, and is in a state of lassitude and pain.

Do not give draughts when the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime of the crisis is at hand, if there be agitation, but only when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fever abates and is alleviated. It is proper to be guarded at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe crises of other fevers, and to withhold the draughts at that season.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFevers of this description are apt to be protracted, and to have determinations,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif the inferior extremities be cold, about the ears and neck, or,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif these parts are not cold, to have other changes; they have epistaxis,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand disorder of the bowels. But in cases of fever attended with nausea,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor distention of the hypochondria, when the patients cannot lie reclined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the same position, and the extremities are cold, the greatest care\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand precaution are necessary; nothing should be given to them, except\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toxymel diluted with water; no draught should be administered, until\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fever abate and the urine be concocted; the patient should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlaid in a dark apartment, and recline upon the softest couch, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\the should be kept as long as possible in the same position, so as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot to toss about, for this is particularly beneficial to him.

Such persons\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshould take less supper than they are wont, and a pudding of barley-meal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore moist than usual instead of bread, and of potherbs the dock,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor mallow, and ptisan, or beets, and along with the food they should\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttake wine in moderation, and diluted with water; after supper they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshould take a short walk, until the urine descend and be passed; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey may use boiled fish. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArticles of food have generally such effects as the following: Garlic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toccasions flatulence and heat about the chest, heaviness of the head,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand nausea, and any other habitual pain is apt to be exasperated by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit; it is diuretic, which, in so far, is a good property which it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpossesses; but to eat it when one means to drink to excess, or when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintoxicated. Cheese produces flatulence and constipation, and heats\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other articles of food; and it gives rise to crudities and indigestion,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut it is worst of all to eat it along with drink after a full meal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPulse of all kinds are flatulent, whether raw, boiled, or fried; least\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tso when macerated in water, or in a green state; they should not be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tused except along with food prepared from the cerealia. Each of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarticles, however, has bad effects peculiar to itself. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvetch, whether raw or boiled, creates flatulence and pain. The lentil\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis astringent, and disorders the stomach if taken with its hull. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlupine has the fewest bad effects of all these things. The stalk and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe juice of silphium (asafoetida), pass through some people's bowels\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvery readily, but in others, not accustomed to them, they engender\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhat is called dry cholera; this complaint is more especially produced\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby it if mixed with much cheese, or eaten along with beef. Melancholic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiseases are most particularly exacerbated by beef, for it is of an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunmanageable nature, and requires no ordinary powers of stomach to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdigest it; it will agree best with those who use it well boiled and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpretty long kept. Goat's flesh has all the bad properties of beef;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit is an indigestible, more flatulent and engenders acid eructations\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand cholera; such as has a fragrant smell, is firm, and sweet to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttaste, is the best, when well baked and cooled; but those kinds which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare disagreeable to the taste, have a bad smell, and are hard, such\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare particularly bad, and especially if very fresh; it is best in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsummer and worst in autumn. The flesh of young pigs is bad, either\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen it is too raw or when it is over-roasted, for it engenders bile\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand disorders the bowels. Of all kinds of flesh, pork is the best;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit is best when neither very fat, nor, on the other hand, very lean,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the animal had not attained the age of what is reckoned an old\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvictim; it should be eaten without the skin, and in a coldish state."}}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "19", "head": "PART 19", "p": "In dry cholera the belly is distended with wind, there is rumbling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the bowels, pain in the sides and loins, no dejections, but, on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe contrary, the bowels are constipated.

If you have had the management of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase from the first, you must not at once saw the bone down to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeninx; for it is not proper that the membrane should be laid bare\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand exposed to injuries for a length of time, as in the end it may\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecome fungous. And there is another danger if you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaw the bone down to the meninx and remove it at once, lest in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tact of sawing you should wound the meninx. But in trepanning, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly a very little of the bone remains to be sawed through, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbone can be moved, you must desist from sawing, and leave the bone\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fall out of itself. For to a bone not sawed through, and where\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta portion is left of the sawing, no mischief can happen; for the portion\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow left is sufficiently thin. In other respects you must conduct\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe treatment as may appear suitable to the wound. And in trepanning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou must frequently remove the trepan, on account of the heat in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbone, and plunge it in cold water. For the trepan being heated by\n\t\t\t\t\t\trunning round, and heating and drying the bone, burns it and makes\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta larger piece of bone around the sawing to drop off, than would otherwise\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo. And if you wish to saw at once down to the membrane, and then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremove the bone, you must also, in like manner, frequently take out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe trepan and dip it in cold water. But if you have not charge of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe treatment from the first, but undertake it from another after\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta time, you must saw the bone at once down to the meninx with a serrated\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrepan, and in doing so must frequently take out the trepan and examine\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith a sound (specillum), and otherwise along the tract of the instrument.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor the bone is much sooner sawn through, provided there be matter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelow it and in it, and it often happens that the bone is more superficial,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially if the wound is situated in that part of the head where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bone is rather thinner than in other parts. But you must take\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcare where you apply the trepan, and see that you do so only where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit appears to be particularly thick, and having fixed the instrument\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere, that you frequently make examinations and endeavor by moving\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bone to bring it up. Having removed it, you must apply the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuitable remedies to the wound. And if, when you have the management\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the treatment from the first, you wish to saw through the bone\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat once, and remove it from the membrane, you must, in like manner,\n\t\t\t\t\t\texamine the tract of the instrument frequently with the sound, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsee that it is fixed on the thickest part of the bone, and endeavor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto remove the bone by moving it about.

But if there be no fever, we must give\n\t\t\t\t\t\temetics, as has been said, and administer the other remedies which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare applicable when the fever is not of a continual type; but if continual\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfever be present, we must not give strong medicines, but enjoin abstinence\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom solid food and soups, and give water for drink, and not allow\n\t\t\t\t\t\twine but  (a composition from vinegar and honey?).

For when the fractured bones of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe arm or fore-arm are bandaged, the fore-arm is suspended in a sling,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand if you bind them up while extended, the figures of the fleshy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparts will be changed in bending the arm at the elbow, for the elbow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcannot be kept long extended, since persons are not in the custom\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof keeping the joint long in this form, but in a bent position, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons who have been wounded in the arm, and are still able to walk\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout, require to have the arm bent at the elbow-joint. But the leg,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth in walking and standing, is habitually extended, either completely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor nearly so, and is usually in a depending position from its construction,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand in order that it may bear the weight of the rest of the body.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWherefore it readily bears to be extended when necessary, and even\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen in bed the limb is often in this position. And when wounded,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessity subdues the understanding, since the patients become incapable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof raising themselves up, so that they neither think of bending the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlimb nor of getting up erect, but remain lying in the same position.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, neither the same position nor the same mode of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbandaging applies to the arm and to the leg. If, then, extension by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeans of men be sufficient, we should not have recourse to any useless\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrivances, for it is absurd to\n\t\t\t\t\t\temploy mechanical means when not required; but if extension by men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe not sufficient, you may use any of the mechanical powers which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis suitable. When sufficiently extended, it will be easy to adjust\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bones and bring them into their natural position, by straightening\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand arranging them with the palms of the hand."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "16", "head": "Part 16", "p": {"pb": [{"@id": "p.187"}, {"@id": "p.188"}], "hi": [{"@rend": "ital", "#text": "gutters?"}, {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "secundum artem"}], "#text": "When the parts are adjusted, you should apply the bandages while the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlimb is in a stretched position, making the first turns to the right\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor to the left, as may be most suitable; and the end of the bandage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be placed over the fracture, and the first turns made at that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace; and then the bandage should be carried up the leg, as described\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith regard to the other fractures. But the bandages should be broader\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand longer, and more numerous, in the case of the leg than in that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the arm.

But\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif you do apply the splints, they should not be applied along the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twound, and they are to be put on in a loose manner, especial care\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing taken that there may be no great compression from the splints.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis direction has been formerly given.

The habit of the body also occasions a certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifference, for in those who are in a state of embonpoint and fleshy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe joint is rarely dislocated, but is more difficult to reduce; but\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen they are more attenuated and leaner than usual, then they are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubject to dislocations which are more easily reduced. And the following\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobservation is a proof that matters are so; for in cattle the thighs\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare most apt to be dislocated at the hip-joint, when they are most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticularly lean, which they are at the end of winter, at which time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen they are particularly subject to dislocations (if I may be allowed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto make such an observation while treating of a medical subject);\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand therefore Homer has well remarked, that of all beasts oxen suffer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe most at that season, and especially those employed at the plow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas being worked in the winter season. In them, therefore, dislocations\n\t\t\t\t\t\thappen most frequently, as being at that time most particularly reduced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin flesh. And other cattle can crop the grass when it is short, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ox cannot do so until it becomes long; for, in the others, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojection of the lip is slender, and so is the upper lip, but in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ox the projection of the lip is thick, and the upper jaw is thick\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand obtuse, and therefore they are incapable of seizing short herbs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the  as having prominent teeth in both their front\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjaws, can crop the grass and grasp it with their teeth while short,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand delight more in short grass than in rank; for, in general, short\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrass is better and more substantial than rank, as having not yet\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven out its fructification.

For all these reasons the ox is most particularly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubject to dislocations; and I have made the more observations respecting\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, as they confirm all that was said before on this subject. With\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregard, then, to the matter on hand, I say that dislocations occur\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore readily, and are more speedily reduced in those who are lean\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan in those who are fleshy; and in those who are humid and lank\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is less inflammation than in such as are dry and fleshy, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey are less compactly knit hereafter, and there is more mucosity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan usual in cases not attended with inflammation, and hence the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoints are more liable to luxations; for, in the main, the articulations\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare more subject to mucosities in those who are lean than in those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho are fleshy; and the flesh of lean persons who have not been reduced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby a proper course of discipline abounds more with mucosity than that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof fat persons.

When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou have burnt through, it will be sufficient, in most cases, to make\n\t\t\t\t\t\teschars only in the lower part; but if there is no danger of the ulcers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassing into one another, and there is a considerable piece of skin\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween them, a thin spatula is to be pushed through these holes which\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave been burned, while, at the same time, the skin is stretched,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor otherwise the instrument could not pass through; but when you\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave passed it through you must let go the skin, and then between\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe two eschars you should form another eschar with a slender iron,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand burn through until you come in contact with the spatula. The following\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirections enable you to determine how much of the skin of the armpit\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be grasped; all men have glands in the armpit greater or smaller,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand also in many other parts of the body. But I will treat in another\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork of the whole constitution of the glands, and explain what they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare, what they signify, and what are their offices. The glands, then,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare not to be taken hold of, nor the parts internal to the glands;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor this would be attended with great danger, as they are adjacent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the most important nerves. But the greater part of the substances\n\t\t\t\t\t\texternal to the glands are to be grasped, for there is no danger from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. And this, also, it is proper to know, that if you raise the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarm much, you will not be able to grasp any quantity of skin worth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmentioning, for it is all taken up with the stretching; and also the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnerves, which by all means you must avoid wounding, become exposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand stretched in this position; but if you only raise the arm a little,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou can grasp a large quantity of skin, and the nerves which you ought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto guard against are left within, and at a distance from the operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShould not, then, the utmost pains be taken in the whole practice\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the art to find out the proper attitude in every case? So much\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregarding the armpit, and these contractions will be sufficient, provided\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe eschars be properly placed. Without the armpit there are only\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo places where one might place the eschars to obviate this affection;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe one before and between the head of the humerus and the tendon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the armpit; and then the skin may be fairly burned through, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot to any great depth, for there is a large vein adjacent, and also\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnerves, neither of which must be touched with the heat. But externally,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone may form another eschar considerably above the tendon at the armpit,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut a little below the head of the humerus; and the skin must be burned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfairly through, but it must not be made very deep, for fire is inimical\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the nerves. Through the whole treatment the sores are to be so\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttreated, as to avoid all strong extension of the arm, and this is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be done moderately, and only as far as the dressing requires; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthus they will be less cooled (for it is of importance to cover up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall sorts of burns if one would treat them mildly), and then the lips\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof them will be less turned aside; there will be less hemorrhage and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfear of convulsions. But when the sores have become clean, and are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing on to cicatrization, then by all means the arm is to be bound\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the side night and day; and even when the ulcers are completely\n\t\t\t\t\t\thealed, the arm must still be bound to the side for a long time; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthus more especially will cicatrization take place, and the wide space\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto which the humerus used to escape will become contracted."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "12", "head": "Part 12", "p": {"hi": [{"@rend": "ital", "#text": "weasel-armed"}, {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "in utero"}], "#text": "When attempts to reduce a dislocated shoulder have failed, if the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpatient be still growing, the bone of the affected arm will not increase\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike the sound one, for although it does increase in so far it becomes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshorter than the other; and those persons called , become\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso from two accidents, either from having met with this dislocation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t, or from another accident, which will be described afterward.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut those who while they were children have had deep-seated suppurations\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout the head of the bone, all become weasel-armed; and this, it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be well known, will be the issue, whether the abscess be opened\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby an incision or cautery, or whether it break spontaneously.

For the most part, then, it should be known, no harm results\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the shoulder or to the rest of the body from fracture of the clavicle,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunless it sphacelate, and this rarely happens. A deformity, however,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmay arise from fracture of the clavicle, and in these cases it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery great at first, but by and by it becomes less. A fractured clavicle,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike all other spongy bones, gets speedily united; for all such bones\n\t\t\t\t\t\tform callus in a short time. When, then, a fracture has recently taken\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace, the patients attach much importance to it, as supposing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmischief greater than it really is, and the physicians bestow great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpains in order that it may be properly bandaged; but in a little time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe patients, having no pain, nor finding any impediment to their\n\t\t\t\t\t\twalking or eating, become negligent; and the physicians finding they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcannot make the parts look well, take themselves off, and are not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsorry at the neglect of the patients, and in the meantime the callus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis quickly formed. The method of dressing which is most appropriate,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis similar to that used in ordinary cases, consisting of cerate, compresses,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand bandages; and it should be most especially known in this operation,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat most compresses should be placed on the projecting bone, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the greatest pressure should be made there. There are certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tphysicians who make a show of superior skill by binding a heavy piece\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof lead on the part in order to depress the projecting bone; but this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmode of treatment does not apply to the clavicle, for it is impossible\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto depress the projecting part to any extent worth mentioning. There\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare others who, knowing the fact that the bandages are apt to slip\n\t\t\t\t\t\toff, and that they do not keep the projecting parts in their place,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapply compresses and bandages like the others, and then having girt\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe patient with a girdle, where it is usually applied with most effect,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey make a heap of the compresses upon the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojecting bone when they apply them, and having fastened the head\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the bandage to the girdle in front, they apply it so as to bring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe turns of it into the line of the clavicle, carrying them to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tback, and then bringing them around the girdle they carry them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fore part and again backward. There are others who do not apply\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bandage round the girdle, but carry the rounds of it by the perineum\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand anus, and along the spine, so as to compress the fracture. To\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan inexperienced person these methods will appear not far from natural,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut when tied, they will be found of no service; for they do not remain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirm any length of time, even if the patient keep his bed, although\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin this position they answer best; and yet even when lying in bed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould he bend his leg, or should his trunk be bent, all the will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe displaced; and, moreover, the bandaging is inconvenient, in as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch as the anus is comprehended by it, and many turns of the bandage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare crowded there in a narrow space. And in the method with the girdle,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe girdle cannot be so firmly girt around, but that the turns of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bandage force the girdle to ascend, and hence of necessity all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other bandages must be slackened. He would seem to me to come\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnearest his purpose, although after all he effects but little, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould take a few turns round the girdle,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut would use the bandage principally to secure the former bandaging;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor in this manner the bandages would be most secure, and would mutually\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassist one another. Every thing now almost has been said which applies\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fracture of the clavicle. But this also should be known, that in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfractures of the clavicle, it is the part attached to the breast which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis uppermost, and that the piece attached to the acromion is the lowermost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe cause of this is, that for the most part the breast can neither\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe depressed nor raised, there being but a slight movement of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoint at the breast, for the sternum is connected together on both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsides with the spine. The clavicle admits of most motion at the joint\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the shoulder, and this arises from its connection with the acromion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd, moreover, when broken, the part which is connected with the sternum\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflies upward, and is not easily forced downward; for it is naturally\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlight, and there is more room for it above than below. But the shoulder,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe arm, and the parts connected with them, are easily moved from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sides and breast, and, on that account, they admit of being considerably\n\t\t\t\t\t\televated and depressed. When, therefore, the clavicle is broken, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfragment attached to the shoulder inclines downward, for it inclines\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch more readily with the shoulder and arm downward than upward.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMatters being as I have stated, they act imprudently who think to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepress the projecting end of the bone. But it is clear that the under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart ought to be brought to the upper, for the former is the movable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpart, and that which has been displaced from its natural position.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is obvious, therefore, that there is no other way of applying force\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto it (for the bandages no more force it to than they force it from);\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut if one will push the arm when at the sides as much as possible\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupward, so that the shoulder may appear as sharp as possible, it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclear that in this way it will be adjusted to the fragment of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbone connected with the breast from which it was torn. If one then\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill apply a bandage, , for the purpose of promoting\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta speedy cure, and will reckon everything else of no value, except\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe position as described, he will form a correct opinion of the case,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand will effect a cure in the speediest and most appropriate manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is of great importance, however, that the patient should lie in\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta recumbent posture.

But for these purposes no physician\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis equal to the index-fingers of the patient himself, if he will pay\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattention and has resolution, for they are the most natural means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEither of the fingers is to be placed firmly along the whole nose,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand thus it is to be gently held, and steadily, if possible until\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit become firm, but if not, he himself is to hold it for as long a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime as possible, or if he cannot, a child or woman should do it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the hands ought to be soft. Thus may a fracture of the nose, attended\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith depression, and not with displacement to the side, but in a straight\n\t\t\t\t\t\tline, be most properly treated.

These are deceived in this way, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey suppose the spinous processes to be the vertebrae themselves,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause every one of them appears round to the touch, not knowing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat these bones are processes from the vertebrae, as formerly stated;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut the vertebrae are at a considerable distance before them; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof all animals, man, in proportion to his bulk, has the belly () the narrowest from behind to before, especially at the breast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen, therefore, any of these processes are severely fractured, whether\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone or more, the part there appears lower than on either side, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor that reason they are deceived, supposing that the vertebrae are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisplaced inward. And the attitudes of the patient contribute also to deceive them;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor if they attempt to put themselves into a bent position, they are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpained, from the skin being stretched at the seat of the injury, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the same time the fragments of the bones wound the skin still more;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut if they bend forward, they feel easier, for the skin at the wound\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis thus relaxed, and the bones are less disposed to hurt them; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif touched, they shrink and bend forward, and the part which is touched\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappears empty and soft.

Gibbosities ( projections backward) from falls generally\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake place when one pitches on the nates, or falls on the shoulders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn this case some one of the vertebrae must necessarily appear higher\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan natural, and those on either side to a less degree; but yet no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone generally has started out of the line of the others, but every\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone has yielded a little, so that a considerable extent of them is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcurved. On this account the spinal marrow easily bears such distortions,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause they are of a circular shape, and not angular. The apparatus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the reduction in this case must be managed in the following manner:\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta strong and broad board, having an oblong furrow in it, is to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfastened in the ground, or, in place of the board, we may scoop out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan oblong furrow in the wall, about a cubit above the floor, or at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany suitable height, and then something like an oaken bench, of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquadrangular shape, is to be laid along (the wall?) at a distance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the wall, which will admit of persons to pass round if necessary,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the bench is to be covered with robes, or anything else which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis soft, but does not yield much; and the patient is to be stoved\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith vapor, if necessary, or bathed with much hot water, and then\n\t\t\t\t\t\the is to be stretched along the board on his face, with his arms laid\n\t\t\t\t\t\talong and bound to his body; the middle, then, of a thong which is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoft, sufficiently broad and long, and composed of two cross straps\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof leather, is to be twice carried along the middle of the patient's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbreast, as near the armpits as possible, then what is over of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthongs at the armpits is to be carried round the shoulders, and afterward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ends of the thong are to be fastened to a piece of wood resembling\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta pestle; they are to be adapted to the length of the bench laid below\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe patient, and so that the pestle-like piece of wood resting against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis bench may make extension. Another such band is to be applied\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove the knees and the ankles, and the ends of the thongs fastened\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto a similar piece of wood; and another thong, broad, soft, and strong,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the form of a swathe, having breadth and length sufficient, is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be bound tightly round the loins, as near the hips as possible;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand then what remains of this swathelike thong, with the ends of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthongs, must be fastened to the piece of wood placed at the patient's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeet, and extension in this fashion is to be made upward and downward,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequally and at the same time, in a straight line. For extension thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade could do no harm, if properly performed, unless one sought to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo mischief purposely. But the physicians, or some person who is strong,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand not uninstructed, should apply the palm of one hand to the hump,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand then, having laid the other hand upon the former, he should make\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure, attending whether this force should be applied directly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdownward, or toward the head, or toward the hips. This method of applying\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforce is particularly safe; and it is also safe for a person to sit\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon the hump while extension is made, and raising himself up, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlet himself fall again upon the patient. And there is nothing to prevent\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta person from placing a foot on the hump, and supporting his weight\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton it, and making gentle pressure; one of the men who is practiced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the palestra would be a proper person for doing this in a suitable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanner. But the most powerful of the mechanical means is this: if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe hole in the wall, or in the piece of wood fastened into the ground,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe made as much below the man's back as may be judged proper, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif a board, made of limetree, or any other wood, and not too narrow,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe put into the hole, then a rag, folded several times or a small\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleather cushion, should be laid on the hump; nothing large, however,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be laid on the back, but just as much as may prevent the board\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom giving unnecessary pain by its hardness; but the hump should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe as much as possible on a line with the hole made in the wall, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the board introduced into it may make pressure more especially\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat that spot. When matters are thus adjusted, one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperson, or two if necessary, must press down the end of the board,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhilst others at the same time make extension and counter-extension\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas along the body, as formerly described. Extension may also be made\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith axles, which may either be fastened in the ground beside the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbench, or the post of the axles may be attached to the bench itself,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif you will make them perpendicular and overtopping () a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle at both ends, or at either end of the bench. These powers are\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasily regulated, so as to be made stronger or weaker, and they are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof such force, that if one were to have recourse to them for a mischievous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurpose, and not as a remedy, they would operate strongly in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway also; for by making merely extension and counter-extension longitudinally,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout any additional force, one might make sufficient extension;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand if, without making extension at all, one were only to press down\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproperly with the board, sufficient force might be applied in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway. Such powers, then, are excellent which admit of being so regulated,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they can be made weaker and stronger as required. And the forces\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare applied in the natural way; for the pressure above forces the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisplaced parts into their place. Natural extension restores parts\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich have come too near one another to their natural position. I,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen, am acquainted with no powers which are better or more appropriate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan these; for extension along the spine downward has no proper hold\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the bone called the os sacrum; and extension upward, along the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneck and head, has indeed a hold; but extension thus made is unseemly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto behold, and, besides, if increased, may occasion much mischief\n\t\t\t\t\t\totherwise. I once made trial of the following plan. Having placed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe patient on his back, I put below the hump a bladder, not inflated,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand afterward introduced air into the bladder by means of a brass\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpipe connected with it. But the experiment did not succeed; for, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe man was fairly extended, the bladder yielded, and the air could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot be forced into it; and, besides, the hump of the patient was apt\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto slip off the distended bladder when they were pressed together.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut when I did not extend the man strongly, the bladder was swelled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup by the air, and the man became more bent forward  than proper. I\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave written this expressly; for it is a valuable piece of knowledge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto learn what things have been tried and have proved ineffectual,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand wherefore they did not succeed."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "48", "head": "Part 48", "p": {"hi": {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "internal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcavity?"}, "pb": {"@id": "p.247"}, "#text": "In curvatures forward of the vertebrae from a fall, or from some heavy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody falling upon them, in general no one of them is displaced far\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeyond the others, but if one or more be so displaced, the case proves\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfatal; but, not withstanding, as formerly stated, the displacement\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis circular, and not angular. In such cases, then, the urine and faeces\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare more apt to be retained than in displacement outward, the feet\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the whole inferior extremities are colder, and the symptoms are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore fatal than in the former case; and if they do survive, they are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore subject to retention of the urine, and to loss of strength, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto torpor in their legs.

In this position\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone can most quickly turn the sound limb under the body, by walking\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the unsound limb outward, and the sound inward.

The proportional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowth of their bones is as follows: in those cases in which the bone\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the leg is dislocated, the bones of the feet grow very little,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas being very near the injury, but the bones of the leg increase in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsize, and with very little defect, but the fleshy parts ()\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare wasted. But when the ankle-joint is in its natural state, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe knee is dislocated, in  these cases the bones of the leg do not grow in like manner, but become shortened, as being nearest the seat of the injury, and the bones of the feet also are atrophied, but not in the same proportion; because, as was said a little while ago, the ankle-joint is safe, and if they could use it, as in the case of club-foot, the bones of the foot would be still less atrophied. When the dislocation takes place at the hip-joint, the bone of the thigh, in this case, does not generally grow in like manner, as being the one nearest the seat of the injury, but becomes shorter than the sound one; but the growth of the bones of the leg is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrested in like manner; nor of those of the feet, for this reason, that there is no displacement between the bones of the thigh and leg, nor between those of the leg and foot; in those cases, however, the fleshy parts of the whole limb are atrophied; but if they could make use of the limb, the growth of the bones would be still more developed, as formerly stated, only the thigh, although its flesh would be much less wasted, would still be by no means so fleshy as the sound limb. The following observations are a proof of this: those persons who are weasel-armed () from birth, owing to dislocation of the humerus, or when the accident has happened to them before they have attained their full growth, such persons have the bone of the arm shortened, but those of the fore-arm and hand are little inferior in size to the sound, for the reasons which have been stated, because the humerus is the bone nearest to the joint affected, and, on that account, it is shorter than natural; but the fore-arm is not equally affected by the accident, because the joint at which the bones of the arm and forearm are articulated remains in its natural condition, and the hand is still further distant than the fore-arm from the seat of the injury. Such are the reasons why certain of the bones in this case increase in growth, and certain do not. The laborious office of the hand contributes much to the development of the flesh in the fore-arm and hand, for whatever work is done by the hand, these weasel-armed persons strive to do no less effectually with the other hand than with the sound; for the arms do not support the weight of the body like the legs, and the work performed by them is light. From exercise, then, the fleshy parts on the hand and fore-arm are not atrophied in weasel-armed persons, and by these means the arm, too, gains flesh. But in dislocation inward at the hip-joint, whether from birth or from childhood, the fleshy parts, on that account, are much more atrophied than those of the hand, because the patients cannot exercise the leg.

When, then, the articular extremity of the femur has worn out a socket for itself in the flesh where it was lodged, and the flesh is lubricated, it ceases to be painful in the course of time, and when it becomes free from pain, they can walk without a staff, if so inclined, and they can support the body on the injured limb.

And in this case, he is under the necessity of supporting the upper part of the thigh with his hand at each step: this also contributes, in a certain degree, to make him bend the body at the groins; for, during the shifting of the feet in walking, the body cannot be supported on the unsound be supported on the unsound limb, unless it be pressed to the ground by the hand,-the end of the femur not being placed properly under the body, but having slipped backward to the nates; and if he should try to rest the weight of his body for a little, upon the foot, without any other support, he would fall backward, for there would be a great inclination in this direction, from the hips having protruded backward far beyond the line of the foot, and the spine inclining toward the hips. Such persons can walk, indeed, without a staff, if so accustomed, for because the sole of the foot is in its old line, and is not inclined outward, they do not require anything to balance them. Such, however, as, instead of grasping the thigh, prefer resting their weight upon a staff introduced into the armpit of the affected side, these, if they use a longer staff, will walk, indeed, more erect, but will not be able to reach the ground with the foot, or if they wish to rest upon the foot, they must take a shorter staff, and will require to bend the body at the groins. The wasting of the fleshy parts is analogous to what happens in the cases formerly described, for the wasting is greatest in those cases in which the patients keep the limb up, and do not exercise it, whilst those who practice walking, have the least atrophy. The sound leg, however, is not benefited, but is rather rendered more deformed, if the injured limb be applied to the ground, for it is forced to cooperate with the other, being protruded at the hip, and bent at the ham. But if the patient does not use the injured limb by applying it to the ground, but carries it up, and rests upon a staff, the sound leg thereby gains strength, for it is employed in its natural position, and further, the exercise gives it strength. But it may be said, these things are foreign to medicine; for what is the use of enlarging upon cases which are already past remedy? This is far from being the case, for it belongs to the knowledge of medicine to be acquainted also with these, and they cannot possibly be separated from one another; for to such as are curable, means are to be used to prevent them from becoming incurable, studying how they may best be prevented from getting into an incurable state. And incurable cases should be known, that they may not be aggravated by useless applications, and splendid and creditable prognostics are made by knowing where, how, and when every case will terminate, and whether it will be converted into a curable or an incurable disease. When then, from birth, or during one's youth, this dislocation backward occurs, and is not reduced, whether it be connected with violence or disease (for many such dislocations occur in diseases, but the nature of the diseases in which dislocations take place, will be described afterward); if, then, the dislocated limb be not reduced, the bone of the thigh becomes shortened, the whole limb is impaired, is arrested in its growth, and loses its flesh from want of use; the articulation at the ham is also impaired, for the nerves () become stretched, from cases formerly stated, wherefore those who have this dislocation, cannot make extension at the knee-joint.

Among these parts the joints and nerves (), if not used, are not the least liable to be so affected; they are impaired, then, for the reasons we have stated, more in this variety of dislocation than in the others, for the whole limb is wasted, both in its bones and in its fleshy parts.

And sometimes they drag the foot along the ground, as not being able to bend the upper part of the limb, and they walk with the whole foot on the ground; for in walking they rest no less on the heel than on the fore part of the foot; and if they could take great steps, they would rest entirely on the heel in walking; for persons whose limbs are sound, the greater the steps they take in walking, rest so much the more on the heel, while they are putting down the one foot and raising the opposite. In this form of dislocation, persons rest their weight more on the heel than on the anterior part of the foot, for the fore part of the foot cannot be bent forward equally well when the rest of the limb is extended as when it is in a state of flexion; neither, again, can the foot be arched to the same degree the limb is bent as when it is extended.

Most cases of congenital club-foot are remediable, unless the declination be very great,  or when the affection occurs at an advanced period of youth. The best plan, then, is to treat such cases at as early a period as possible, before the deficiency of the bones of the foot is very great, and before there is any great wasting of the flesh of the leg. There is more than one variety of club-foot, the most of them being not complete dislocations, but impairments connected with the habitual maintenance of the limb in a certain position. In conducting the treatment, attention must be paid to the following points: to push back and rectify the bone of the leg at the ankle from without inward, and to make counter-pressure on the bone of the heel in an outward direction, so as to bring it bring it into line, in order that the displaced bones may meet at the middle and side of the foot; and the mass of the toes, with the great toe, are to be inclined inward, and retained so; and the parts are to be secured, with cerate containing a full proportion of resin, with compresses, and soft bandages insufficient quantity, but not applied too tight; and the turns of the bandages should be in the same direction as the rectifying of the foot with the hand, so that the foot may appear to incline a little outward. And a sole made of leather not very hard, or of lead, is to be bound on, and it is not to be applied to the skin but when you are about to make the last turns of the bandages. And when it is all bandaged, you must attach the end of one of the bandages that are used to the bandages applied to the inferior part of the foot on the line of the little toe; and then this bandage is to be rolled upward in what is considered to be a sufficient degree, to above the calf of the leg, so that it may remain firm when thus arranged. In a word, as if moulding a wax model, you must bring to their natural position the parts which were abnormally displaced and contracted together, so rectifying them with your hands, and with the bandaging in like manner, as to bring them into their position, not by force, but gently; and the bandages are to be stitched so as to suit the position in which the limb is to be placed, for different modes of the deformity require different positions. And a small shoe made of lead is to be bound on externally to the bandaging, having the same shape as the Chian slippers had. But there is no necessity for it if the parts be properly adjusted  with the hands, properly secured with the bandages, and properly disposed of afterward. This, then, is the mode of cure, and it neither requires cutting, burning, nor any other complex means, for such cases yield sooner to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttreatment than one would believe. However, they are to be fairly mastered only by time, and not until the body has grown up in the natural shape; when recourse is had to a shoe, the most suitable are the buskins, which derive their name from being used in traveling through mud; for this sort of shoe does not yield to the foot, but the foot yields to it.

In cases then, of fracture of the bones, when strangulation and blackening of the parts take place at first, the separation of the dead and living parts quickly occurs, and the parts speedily drop off, as the bones have already given way; but when the blackening () takes place while the bones are entire, the fleshy parts, in this case, also quickly die, but the bones are slow in separating at the boundary of the blackening, and where the bones are laid bare. Those parts of the body which are below the boundaries of the blackening are to be removed at the joint, as soon as they are fairly dead and have lost their sensibility; care being taken not to wound any living part; for if the part which is cut off give pain, and if it prove not to be quite dead, there is great danger lest the patient may swoon away from the pain, and such swoonings often are immediately fatal. I have known the thigh-bones, when denuded in this manner, drop off on the eightieth day; but in the case of this patient, the parts below were separated at the knee on the twentieth day, and, as I thought, too early, for it appeared to me that this should be done more guardedly. In a case which I had of such blackening in the leg, the bones of the leg, as far as they were denuded, separated at its middle on the sixtieth day. But the separation of denuded bones is quicker or slower, according to the mode of treatment; something, too, depends upon whether the compression be stronger or weaker, and whether the nerves, flesh, arteries, and veins are quicker or slower in becoming blackened and in dying; since, when the parts are not strongly compressed, the separation is more superficial, and does not go the length of laying the bones bare, and in some cases it is still more superficial, so as not even to expose the nerves. For the reasons now stated, it is impossible to define accurately the time at which each of these cases will terminate. The treatment of such cases, however, is to be readily undertaken, for they are more formidable to look at than to treat; and a mild treatment is sufficient in all such cases, for they come to a crisis of themselves; only the diet must be attended to, so that it may be as little  calculated to create fever as possible, and the body is to be placed in the proper positions: these are, neither raised very high up, nor inclined much downward, but rather upward, until the separation be completed; for at that time there is most danger of hemorrhage; on this account, wounds should not be laid in a declining position, but the contrary. But after a while, and when the sores have become clean, the same positions will no longer be appropriate; but a straight position, and one inclining downward, may be proper; and in the course of time, in some of these cases, abscesses form, and require bandages. One may also expect that such patients will be attacked with dysentery; for dysentery usually supervenes in cases of mortification and of hemorrhage from wounds; it comes on generally when the blackening and hemorrhage have arrived at a crisis, and is profuse and intense, but does not last many days; neither is it of a fatal nature, for such patients do not usually lose their appetite, nor is it proper to put them on a restricted diet."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "70", "head": "Part 70", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "p.268"}, "#text": "Dislocation inward at the hip-joint is to be reduced in the following manner: (it is a good, proper, and natural mode of reduction, and has something of display in it, if any one takes delight in such ostentatious modes of procedure).

This method comprises all the conditions which are natural; for the body being suspended by its weight, produces extension, and the person suspended from him, along with the extension, forces the head of the thigh-bone to rise up above the acetabulum; and at the same time he uses the bone of the fore-arm as a lever, and forces the os femoris to slip into its old seat.

But much more frequently it does not yield to any ordinary apparatus, and therefore one should be acquainted with the most powerful means which can be applied in each case, and use whatever maybe judged most proper under all circumstances. The modes of extension have been described in the former parts of the work, so that one may make use of whatever may happen to be at hand. For, extension and counter-extension are to be made in the direction of the limb and the body; and if this be properly effected, the head of the thigh-bone will be raised above its ancient seat; and if thus raised, it will not be easy to prevent it from settling in its place, so that any ordinary impulse with the lever and adjustment will be quite sufficient; but some apply insufficient extension, and hence the reduction gives much trouble. The bands then should be fastened, not only at the foot, but also above the knee, so that the force of the extension may not be expended on the knee-joint more than upon the hip-joint. The extension in the direction of the foot is to be thus contrived. But the counter-extension is not only to be managed by means of something carried round the chest and armpits, but also by a long, double, strong, and supple thong applied to the perineum, and carried behind along the spine, and in front along the collar-bone  and fixed to the point from which counter-extension is made; and then force is to be so applied, by means of this extension and counter-extension, that the thong at the perineum may not pass over the head of the thigh-bone, but between it and the perineum; and during the extension one should strike the head of the femur with the fist, so as to drive it outward. And when the patient is raised up by the stretching, you should pass a hand through () and grasp it with the other hand, so as at the same time to make extension, and force the dislocated limb outward; while some other person sitting by the knee quietly directs it inward."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "72", "head": "Part 72", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "p.270"}, "#text": "It has been formerly stated by us that it will be of importance for any person who practices medicine in a populous city to get prepared a quadrangular board, about six cubits or a little more in length, and about two cubits in breadth; a fathom will be sufficient thickness for it; and then along it from the one end to the other, an excavation must be made, so that the working of the levers may not be higher than is proper; then at both sides we are to raise short, strong, and strongly-fixed posts, having axles; and in the middle of the bench five or six long grooves are to be scooped out about four inches distant from one another, three inches will be a sufficient breadth for them, and the depth in like manner; and although the number of grooves I have mentioned will be sufficient, there is nothing to prevent their being made all over the bench. And the bench should have in its middle a pretty deep hole, of a square shape, and of about three inches in size; and into this hole, when judged necessary, is to be adjusted a corresponding piece of wood, rounded above, which, at the proper time, is to be adjusted between the perineum and the head of the thigh-bone. This upright piece of wood prevents the body from yielding to the force dragging downward by the feet; for sometimes this piece of wood serves the purpose of counter-extension upward; and sometimes, too, when extension and counter-extension are made, this piece of wood, if susceptible of some motion to this side or that, will serve the purpose of a lever for pushing the head of the thigh-bone outward. It is on this account that several grooves are scooped out on the bench,  so that this piece of wood, being erected at the one which answers, may act as a lever, either on the sides of the articular heads of bones, or may make pressure direct on the heads along with the extension, according as it may suit to push inward or outward with the lever; and the lever may be either of a round or broad form, as may be judged proper; for sometimes the one form and sometimes the other suits with the articulation. This mode of applying the lever along with extension is applicable in the reduction of all dislocations of the thigh.

And, in all cases of reduction at joints, the patient must be put on a spare diet, but more especially in the case of the greatest joints, and those most difficult to reduce, and less so in those which are very small and easily reduced."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "80", "head": "Part 80", "p": {"pb": {"@id": "p.275"}, "#text": "If any joint of the fingers is dislocated, whether the first, second, or the third, the same method of reduction is to be applied, but the largest joints are the most difficult to reduce. There are four modes of displacement-either upward, downward, or to either side; most commonly upward, and most rarely laterally, and in consequence of violent motion. On both sides of its articular cavity there is a sort of raised border. When the dislocation is upward or downward, owing to the articular cavity having smoother edges there than at the sides, if the joint of it be dislocated, it is more easily reduced. This is the mode of reduction:-The end of the finger is to be wrapped round with a fillet, or something such, that, when you lay hold of it and make extension, it will not slip; and when this is done, some person is to grasp the arm at the wrist, and another is to take hold of the finger which is wrapped in the fillet, and then each is to make considerable extension toward himself, and at the same time the projecting bone is to be pushed into its place. But, if the dislocation be lateral, the same mode of reduction is to be used; but when you think that the extremity of the bone has cleared the rim, at the same time that extension is made, the bone is to be pushed direct into its place, while another person on the other side of the finger is to take care and make counter-pressure, so that it may not again slip out there. The twisted nooses formed from palm-shoots are convenient for effecting reduction, if you will make extension and counter-extension by holding the twisted string in the one hand and the wrist in the other. When reduced, you must bind the part as quickly as possible with bandages; these are to be very slender and waxed with cerate, neither very soft nor very hard, but of middle consistence; for that which is hard drops off from the finger, while that which is soft and liquid is melted and lost by the increased heat of the finger. The bandage is to be loosed on the third or fourth day; but on the whole, if inflamed, it is to be the more frequently loosed, and if otherwise, more rarely; this I say respecting all the joints.

When any of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings occur, the body immediately shivers, the person becoming speechless\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcannot draw his breath, but the breath () stops, the brain is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontracted, the blood stands still, and thus the excretion and defluxion\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the phlegm take place. In children, these are the causes of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattack at first. But to old persons winter is most inimical. For when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe head and brain have been heated at a great fire, and then the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperson is brought into cold and has a rigor, or when from cold he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomes into warmth, and sits at the fire, he is apt to suffer in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame way, and thus he is seized in the manner described above. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is much danger of the same thing occurring, if his head be exposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the sun, but less so in summer, as the changes are not sudden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen a person has passed the twentieth year of his life, this disease\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis not apt to seize him, unless it has become habitual from childhood,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor at least this is rarely or never the case. For the veins are filled\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith blood, and the brain consistent and firm, so that it does not\n\t\t\t\t\t\trun down into the veins, or if it do, it does not master the blood,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich is copious and hot."}, {"pb": {"@id": "p.365"}, "#text": "But when it has gained strength from one's childhood, and become habitual,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch a person usually suffers attacks, and is seized with them in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanges of the winds, especially in south winds, and it is difficult\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof removal.

If you will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcut open the head, you will find the brain humid, full of sweat, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thaving a bad smell.

For, the north wind condenses\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe air, and separates from it whatever is muddy and nebulous, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenders it clearer and brighter, and so in like manner also, all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twinds which arise from the sea and other waters; for they extract\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe humidity and nebulosity from all objects, and from men themselves,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand therefore it (the north wind) is the most wholesome of the winds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the effects of the south are the very reverse.
