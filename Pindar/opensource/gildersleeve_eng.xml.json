We know that Pindar's epinicia, like the odes of tragedies\n                                and comedies, were performed by a singing and dancing chorus. The\n                                poets composed not only the words but also the music and the dance\n                                steps; it seems clear, then, that all three must have supported each\n                                other. Up to this point scholars of the 19th, 20th, and 21st\n                                centuries are all in agreement. It also seems clear that metrically\n                                long syllables should have longer musical notes, and metrically\n                                short syllables should have shorter musical notes. This logical\n                                hypothesis  supported by the existing papyri with\n                                musical notation (collected in ).

This leads Gildersleeve\n                                to lengthen or shorten notes to make them fit an externally-imposed\n                                pattern. Moreover, there is no objective way to determine which\n                                notes must be lengthened or shortened.

The fourth line has no base, a one-choriamb nucleus,\n                                and a one-syllable tail.\n                                Pindar's aeolics are more complex and may be mixed with iambic and\n                                trochaic lines.

His brother, of uncertain name, was a mighty\n                                hunter, and much given to athletic sports, and this has suggested\n                                the unfailing parallel of Amphion and Zethos. The names of his\n                                mother, Kleodike (or Kleidike), of his wife, whether Timoxene or\n                                Megakleia, his daughters, Protomache and Eumetis, have an\n                                aristocratic ring, for there were aristocratic names in antiquity as\n                                in modern times.

As well allegorize Aristeides, Perikles,\n                                Demosthenes, because their names happen to fit their fortunes. But\n                                Pindar's aristocratic origin rests on surer foundations, and we have\n                                good reason for calling him an Aigeid (-71). What the relations were between the Theban and the\n                                Spartan Aigeidai is a matter of lively discussion. It is enough for\n                                understanding Pindar that it was an ancient and an honored house,\n                                and that Pindar was in every fibre an aristocrat. This explains his\n                                intimacy with men of rank, and his evident connection with the\n                                priesthood  the stronghold of the aristocracy. To his\n                                aristocratic birth, no less than to his lofty character, was due his\n                                participation in the , or\n                                banquet of the gods at Delphi  an honor which was\n                                perpetuated in his family; and the story that he was a priest of\n                                Magna Mater is confirmed by his own words (-79), if not suggested by them."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Boeotia."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "1", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*boiwti/a u(=s"}, "#text": "Of course it may be said that Pindar was a\n                                    Boeotian only in name, not in blood  belonging, as he\n                                    did, to the old pre-Boeotian stock; but as he himself accepts\n                                    the name with the responsibility (), we need go no further."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Pindar of Kynoskephalai."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Training."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Korinna."}], "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pre/sbeira *kwpa/|dwn kora=n"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Non sine dis animosus\n                                infans"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "caput artis, decere"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "th=| xeiri\\ dei=n spei/rein\n                                    a)lla\\ mh\\ o(/lw| tw=| qula/kw|"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*boiwti/a\n                                u(=s"}], "pb": [{"@n": "ix"}, {"@n": "x"}], "bibl": {"@n": "Pind.

Large\n                                historical views are not always entertained by the cleverest minds,\n                                ancient and modern, transatlantic and cisatlantic; and the annals of\n                                politics, of literature, of thought, have shown that out of the\n                                depths of crass conservatism and proverbial sluggishness come, not\n                                by any miracle, but by the process of accumulated force, some of the\n                                finest intelligences, some of the greatest powers, of political,\n                                literary, and especially religious life.

If such parallels are not safe, it may be safe to adduce one\n                                that has itself been paralleled with the story of the Island of the\n                                Saints, and to call attention to the part that the despised province\n                                of Cappadocia played in the history of the Christian Church. A\n                                Cappadocian king was a butt in the time of Cicero; the Cappadocians\n                                were the laughing-stock of the Greek anthology, and yet there are no\n                                prouder names in the literary history of the Church than the names\n                                of the Cappadocian fathers, Basil and the Gregories. But, apart from\n                                this, Boeotia has been sadly misjudged. Pindar, Pelopidas, and\n                                Epameinondas were not all, nor yet the  of the Acharnians. There\n                                is no greater recommendation of the study of Greek lyric poetry than\n                                this  that it enfranchises the reader from Athenian\n                                prejudice and Athenian malice, while Athens herself is not less dear\n                                than before. Pindar, then, was an aristocrat in a canton\n                                that a modern census-taker might have shaded with select and special\n                                blackness. Himself born at Thebes, his  parents are said\n                                to have come to the city from an outlying northwestern deme,\n                                Kynoskephalai, a high hill overlooking the swamp Hylike. Of his\n                                infancy we know nothing. The tale that bees distilled honey on his\n                                lips is told over and over of the childhood of poets and\n                                philosophers. , we are as ready to believe to be true of him as of\n                                any other great man. Of course he enjoyed the advantage of an\n                                elaborate training. Perhaps Boeotians trained even more than did the\n                                Athenians. The flute he learned at home, and it is supposed that at\n                                a later period he\n                                enjoyed the instructions of Lasos of Hermione, the regenerator of\n                                the dithyramb; although it must be noted that the Greeks have an\n                                innocent weakness for connecting as many famous names as possible in\n                                the relation of teacher and pupil. The statement imposes on nobody.\n                                One goes to school to every great influence. It is only honest to\n                                say, however, that if Pindar studied under Lasos he was either an\n                                ungrateful scholar or underrated his indebtedness to his master.\n                                Unfortunately the jibbing pupils are sometimes the best, and the\n                                teacher's fairest results are sometimes gained by the resistance of\n                                an active young mind. At all events, Pindar has very little to say\n                                about training in his poems, much about native endowment, which was\n                                to him, as an aristocrat, largely hereditary. We may therefore\n                                dismiss Pindar's teachers  Skopelinos, Apollodoros,\n                                Agathokles. It is enough for us to know or to divine that he was\n                                carefully trained, and had to submit to the rude apprenticeship of\n                                genius. First a drillmaster for others, then a composer on his own\n                                account, he had to work and wait. His great commissions did not come\n                                until he had won a national name. Goethe has commended, as others\n                                had done before and others have done since, the counsel of noble\n                                women to all who seek the consummation of art, the . Korinna  the\n                                story is at least well invented  Pindar's fellow-student, not\n                                his teacher, gave him a great lesson. In his first poem, he had\n                                neglected to insert myths. Admonished of this omission by Korinna,\n                                and remembering that his monitress was herself famous \n                                for her handling of the myth, he crowded his next hymn with\n                                mythological figures  the fragment is still preserved\n                                (II. 1, 2)  whereupon she said, with a smile:\n                                One ought to sow with the hand, not with the whole\n                                sack (). It is unnecessary to\n                                emphasize the feminine tact of the advice. On another occasion\n                                Korinna is said to have blamed Pindar for having used an Attic word.\n                                This, also, is not a bad invention. It accords with the conservative\n                                character of woman; it accords with the story that Korinna won a\n                                victory over Pindar by the familiar charm of her Boeotian dialect as\n                                well as by the beauty of her person, a beauty not lost in the\n                                picture at Tanagra, which represented her in the act of encircling\n                                her head with a fillet of victory. Aelian, an utterly untrustworthy\n                                scribbler, adds that Pindar, in the bitterness of his heart, called\n                                his successful rival a swine. If Pindar used the phrase at all, it\n                                must be remembered that  () was a common\n                                expression  half spiteful, half sportive  and\n                                that the moral character of the swine stood higher with the Greeks\n                                than it stands with us. The swine-woman of Phokylides, who was\n                                neither good nor bad, was not the sow of the Old Testament or the\n                                New. The Greeks were brotherly to the lower animals. Bull, cow,\n                                heifer, cock, ass, dog, were at all events not beneath the level of\n                                the highest poetry."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Myrtis."}, "#text": "Encouraged, perhaps, by Korinna's success, a younger poetess, Myrtis,\n                                attempted to cope with Pindar.

A close contemporary of Aischylos\n                                (born 525 B.C.), Pindar suggests a comparison with the great\n                                Athenian; but no matter how many external resemblances may be found,\n                                nay, no matter how many fine sentiments and exemplary reflections\n                                they may have in common, the inner dissidence remains.

Was Pindar in thorough sympathy with the\n                                party of the Theban nobility to which he belonged by birth, by\n                                training, by temperament, or was he a friend of the national cause\n                                 as it is safe to call a cause after it has been\n                                successful? Within the state there seems to be no question that\n                                Pindar was a thoroughpaced aristocrat, and those who think they have\n                                noticed greater liberality in the middle of his life have to\n                                acknowledge that he became more rigid towards the close. Without the\n                                state his imagination must have been fired by the splendid\n                                achievements of the Hellenes, and his religious sense must have been\n                                stirred by the visible working of the divine power in setting up and\n                                putting down. He could not but be proud of the very victories that\n                                told against his own country, and yet there is no note in all his\n                                poems that shows the kinship that reveals itself in Simonides. The\n                                story that the famous fragment in praise of Athens brought upon him\n                                the displeasure of his countrymen, which they manifested by the\n                                imposition of a heavy fine, reimbursed twofold by the Athenians\n                                 this story, with all its variations, the statue, the\n                                    , has not escaped the\n                                cavils of the critics, and does not, in any case, prove anything\n                                more than a generous recognition of the prowess of an alien state,\n                                if, after all, anything Greek could be alien to a man so fully in\n                                sympathy with all  that made Greece what it was. For in\n                                the sense that he loved all Greece, that he felt the ties of blood,\n                                of speech, above all, the ties of religion, Pindar was Panhellenic.\n                                The pressure of the barbarian that drew those ties tighter for\n                                Greece generally, drew them tighter for him also; but how? We are in\n                                danger of losing our historical perspective by making Pindar feel\n                                the same stir in the same way as Aischylos. If he had, he would not\n                                have been a true Theban; and if he had not been a true Theban, he\n                                would not have been a true Greek. The man whose love for his country\n                                knows no local root, is a man whose love for his country is a poor\n                                abstraction; and it is no discredit to Pindar that he went honestly\n                                with his state in the struggle. It was no treason to Medize before\n                                there was a Greece, and the Greece that came out of the Persian war\n                                was a very different thing from the cantons that ranged themselves\n                                on this side and on that of a quarrel which, we may be sure, bore\n                                another aspect to those who stood aloof from it than it wears in the\n                                eyes of moderns, who have all learned to be Hellenic patriots. A\n                                little experience of a losing side might aid historical vision. That\n                                Pindar should have had an intense admiration of the New Greece,\n                                should have felt the impulse of the grand period that followed\n                                Salamis and Plataia, should have appreciated the woe that would have\n                                come on Greece had the Persians been successful, and should have\n                                seen the finger of God in the new evolution of Hellas \n                                all this is not incompatible with an attitude during the Persian war\n                                that those who see the end and do not understand the beginning may\n                                not consider respectable."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Travels."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Myths."}], "pb": {"@n": "xiii"}, "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "qeoce/nia"}, {"@lang": "xgreek", "#text": "parthenion"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*)=w *pa/n"}], "#text": "The life of a lyric poet was usually a life of travel.

We see again temples and treasure-houses, the flashing\n                                feet of the runners, the whirlwind rush of the chariots, the darting\n                                of the race-horses, the resolute faces of the men who ran in armor,\n                                the gleaming flight of the javelins, the tough persistence of the\n                                wrestlers, each striving to put off on his antagonist the foulness\n                                of defeat.

The Nike of Paionios\n                                revives for us the resistless rush of victory; the breeze that fills\n                                her robe quickens the blood in our veins.

Many masters\n                                of style have pictured to us the Olympic games, but these things\n                                belong to masters of style, and no  futile rivalry will\n                                be attempted here with what has helped so many to a clearer image of\n                                the great scene.

The god, the hero,\n                                is often the centre of some myth that occupies the bulk of the poem,\n                                and it may seem at the first glance, perhaps after repeated reading,\n                                that mere caprice had dictated the choice of this or that myth\n                                rather than another, but closer study seldom fails to reveal a\n                                deeper meaning in the selection. The myth is often a parallel, often\n                                a prototype. Then the scene of the victory is sacred. Its beauties\n                                and its fortunes are unfailing sources of song. We learn how\n                                Pelops of yore won the chariot-race against Oinomaos, we learn how\n                                Herakles planted the Altis with trees, and brought the olive from\n                                the distant land that lies behind the blast of shrill Boreas. Not\n                                less favored is the land of the victor. Country and city are often\n                                blended with goddess or heroine whose history of trial and\n                                triumph prefigures the trial and triumph of the victor. Then the\n                                history of the house often carried the poet up to the higher levels of\n                                poetry, for the house was not unfrequently an old heroic line going\n                                back into the mythic past. The  is thus lifted up above the mere occasional\n                                poem, and we can well understand how such a crown of glory as a\n                                Pindaric ode would be carefully preserved and brought forth on each\n                                recurrence of the festal day. Such a poem has often for its theme a\n                                grand tradition, traditional hospitality, traditional freedom from\n                                    , that arch-crime against\n                                the life of a Greek state, traditional victories. Even when the\n                                fortunes of  a house have been chequered, what is lost\n                                in brilliancy is gained in human interest. The line disowned of\n                                Fortune comes to its rights again. The glory of the grandsire is\n                                revived in the third generation. Then there is the victory itself\n                                with all the splendor that attends it  the sacrifices,\n                                the processions, the banquets, the songs; and, not least, the songs,\n                                for Pindar magnifies his calling, and large space is given to the\n                                praise of poetry."}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "xgreek", "#text": "epinikion"}, {"@lang": "xgreek", "#text": "epinikion"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*mh\\ ma/teue *zeu\\s\n                                gene/sqai."}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "The Epinikion a song of praise."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Limits."}], "pb": {"@n": "xxvi"}, "bibl": {"@n": "Pind.

And yet the poetry of Pindar does not lose itself in\n                                generalities. He compares his song to a bee that hastes from flower\n                                to flower, but the bee has a hive. He compares his song to a ship,\n                                but the ship has a freight and a port. His song does not fly on and\n                                on like a bird of passage. Its flight is the flight of an eagle, to\n                                which it has so often been likened, circling the heavens, it is\n                                true, stirring the ether, but there is a point on which the eye is\n                                bent, a mark, as he says, at which the arrow is aimed. The victory\n                                is not forgotten. The  is\n                                what its name implies. Not a set piece of poetic fire-works, nor\n                                yet, as many would make it out to be, a sermon in rhythm. It is a\n                                song of praise. But all extravagance of eulogy is repressed by the\n                                dread of Nemesis, by that law of balance which kept the\n                                Greek in awe of presumption. The victor may see his image\n                                transfigured into\n                                the form of hero, or even god; only he is reminded that he is of the\n                                earth.  Sometimes the praise is veiled with the myth,\n                                but when it is direct, it is delicate. The victor's garland, he\n                                says, demands the song, but the song is not such a trumpet-blast as\n                                would blow the garland off the victor's head, if not the victor's\n                                head as well. That is modern eulogy. Of course it will be said that\n                                Pindar's eulogy was eulogy to order, but it was  not\n                                falsehood with a cunning makeweight of good advice. The eulogy\n                                spends itself where eulogy is earned. To whiten Hieron is easier\n                                than to blacken Pindar. The excellence of the victors in the\n                                athletic contest, of men like Diagoras, of boys like Agesidamos, the\n                                liberality of Theron, of Hieron, of Arkesilas in the chariot-race,\n                                are assuredly fit themes for praise. The prosperity of the victor\n                                and his house, as a sign of God's favor, might well deserve the\n                                commendation of the poet. But Pindar was too high a character to\n                                make deliberate merchandise of falsehood, and while it runs counter\n                                to commonsense to suppose that he availed himself of his commission\n                                to read the high and mighty tyrants of Greece lectures on their\n                                moral defects, he is too much a reflection of the Apollo, who is his\n                                master, to meddle with lies. With all his faults, Hieron was a Doric\n                                prince of whom Dorians needed not to be ashamed, but there is\n                                reserve enough in Pindar's praise of a man like Hieron to make us\n                                feel the contrast when he comes to Theron. Unfortunately, Pindar is\n                                not expected to have humor, and the jest of the hireling\n                                Muse and the silvered countenance\n                                 be it of Terpsichore or\n                                of songs ()  has done him harm with critics of narrow\n                                vision."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Pindar's relations to the\n                                victors."}, "pb": {"@n": "xxvii"}, "foreign": {"@lang": "fr", "#text": "mmoires pour servir,"}, "#text": "In all estimates of Pindar's poetry, it is important to remember that he belonged to the aristocracy of Greece,\n                                that his poems were composed for the aristocracy, and that he spoke\n                                of them and to them as their peer. No man of the people is praised\n                                in his poems. It is the purest fancy that Thrasydaios (P. 11) was\n                                other than a man of the highest birth. Now men of aristocratic\n                                habits are scrupulously polite to persons of inferior position with\n                                whom they may be brought into social contact. Among their own set\n                                their manners are less reserved. And Pindar was in his own set when\n                                he was among these Olympian and Pythian victors, and there was a\n                                strain of familiar banter in his poems that would not have been\n                                tolerated or tolerable in any ordinary man. It is not likely that he\n                                made an allusion to Psaumis's gray hair (O. 4). If he did, it would\n                                pass. It is undeniable that he made a harmless jest at the\n                                insignificant  appearance of his townsman Melissos\n                                (I. 3). When he hints at envy and feud, he has the tone of one who\n                                knows all the secrets of a coterie, and when he sorrows, he sorrows\n                                as one who has carried the body of a friend to the tomb.

Far less dangerous is the paradox of Moriz Haupt,\n                                     In the transfer to a foreign language the word loses its\n                                atmosphere, its associations, its vitality. The angle at which it\n                                meets the mental vision is often changed, the rhythm of the sentence\n                                is lost. The further one penetrates into the life of a language, the\n                                harder does translation become; and so we often have the result that\n                                the version of the young student is better than that of the\n                                experienced scholar, because the latter tries to express too much,\n                                and hence falls into paraphrase and sheer cumbrousness. The true\n                                vision of a work of literary art is to be gained by the study of the\n                                original, and by that alone. And this holds even as to the ethic\n                                value of poetry. To put Pindar's thoughts, his views of life, into\n                                other words, is often to sacrifice the delicate point on which the\n                                whole moral turns. If this is true of the single word, the single\n                                sentence, it holds with still more force of the attempt to form an\n                                image of the poet's world of thought and feeling by the simple\n                                process of cataloguing translations of  his most\n                                striking thoughts under certain rubrics. This has been done by\n                                various scholars, notably by Bippart and by Buchholz. With their help\n                                one can give ode and verse for Pindar's attitude towards the beliefs\n                                of his time, for his views of the gods and heroes, of human destiny,\n                                of politics, practical and speculative, of Pindar's relations to\n                                    persons. One can give ode and verse for Pindar's belief in\n                                blood, in genius, for his contempt of the groundlings, for his\n                                tenets of art, of life, of government, if, indeed, we dare break up\n                                the antique unity in which all three are merged. But the methodical\n                                channels in which Pindar's poetical vein is thus made to run give no\n                                notion of the play of the poet's genius. The stream that escapes\n                                from the waste-pipe of a fountain gives no notion of the rise and\n                                fall and swirl and spray and rainbow glitter of the volume of water\n                                that rejoices to return the sportive touch of the sunlight. The\n                                catechism has its uses, but it is not the Bible, and as there is no\n                                space in this essay for a Pindaric catechism, it must suffice to\n                                show how much the study of a few odes will teach us of what Pindar\n                                believed concerning God, and what duty he thought God required of\n                                man. True, to the great question, What is God?\n                                Pindar has no answer in any of his odes; he is as silent as\n                                Simonides. But when we ask, Are there more gods than\n                                one? the answer comes speedily from the first Olympian,\n                                There be gods many and lords many. Zeus\n                                dominates officially (), and some see in this, as\n                                in the use of  and  elsewhere, a tendency to the\n                                monotheistic idea, but Poseidon (, ), who held the\n                                Peloponnesos in his embrace, rules the myth. We are reminded of\n                                Kronos (); Aphrodite is not\n                                forgotten (), nor one of the\n                                great powers behind the throne, Klotho (),  to say nothing of the unfailing Muses\n                                (v. 112). We are in the familiar world of Greek\n                                divinities. The poet's attitude towards the gods is that of his\n                                people, and a study of all the odes would only confirm the\n                                impression of the first. Nearly every ode is full of gods. Not one\n                                of the shining forms of the great divinities is lacking, not even\n                                Hestia, who has a large space in N. 11. Pindar's world of the gods\n                                is an organized state, won by the victory of Zeus over the Titanic\n                                brood. In the first Olympian, as in all the Olympians, Zeus rules\n                                serenely. It is true that his throne, Aitna, rests on the violent\n                                hundred-headed Typhoeus (), but\n                                we do not feel the stirrings of the revolted spirit as in , or in , for the Pythians magnify the office of Apollo,\n                                who is the Word of Zeus, the god that bids harmony and measure reign\n                                in state and man. The being of Apollo is much more deeply inwrought\n                                with the Pythian odes than that of Zeus with the Olympian."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Mythology."}, "cit": [{"bibl": {"@n": "Pind.

The cultivation of a religious\n                                temper is his resource against scepticism, and this age has seen\n                                many shining examples of critical knowledge  held in\n                                harmless solution by reverence for the divine.

If higher come, he can still ascend. A more glorious\n                                victory shall receive a still sweeter song. The arrow shot has\n                                reached the lone ether, but the Muse has still her strongest bolt in\n                                reserve for him, and in his closing prayer he wishes a lofty career\n                                for Hieron, and side by side with the prince let the poet stand,\n                                    . The proud self-assertion is hardly veiled by\n                                the prayer. In the second Olympian there is the same maintenance of\n                                high pretension. In the first Olympian it is the Muse that keeps her\n                                strongest bolt in reserve. In the second it is the poet himself that\n                                keeps his arrow within his quiver (v. 92). He seems, as has been\n                                said, to rise to the stature of Apollo himself in his proud scorn of\n                                the Python brood. How, then, is this to be reconciled with the\n                                self-control, the freedom from boasting, which Hellenic ethic\n                                enjoins? It is because of the source of genius  God\n                                himself. Pindar looks down on lesser poets as eagles  on ravens (), on daws\n                                    (). Contempt, scorn,\n                                superciliousness are hardly the words. It is a sublime looking over\n                                the heads of his rivals with at most a faint consciousness of their\n                                cawing far below. This is a dangerous assumption, an attitude that\n                                may be nothing but a posture, and we resent it in inferior poets,\n                                who take on Pindaric airs. But Pindar at his greatest height does\n                                not forget by whom he is borne up, the limits of his god-given\n                                power. . The little that he has to say about training bears on the\n                                games rather than on his art. In  he is speaking expressly of a trainer, and there the meaning is disputed. Mild enough is .

If\n                                Pindar cultivated a choice garden of the Graces, it is by a skill\n                                that Fate has allotted him ().\n                                If men are good and wise, it is in accordance with a  (v. 28), and as if never weary of\n                                the theme, he comes back to it in v. 100. Again it sounds forth in\n                                    : wisdom\n                                is of God. When he longs for the good and the beautiful\n                                it must come from God ().\n                                Part and parcel of this belief in nature, in God, is his belief in\n                                heredity. This comes out more crudely, as might be expected, in his\n                                earliest poem  which is an arrangement in God and Blood\n                                (P. 10), but it is no less fundamental in that which some consider\n                                his latest (P. 8), when he intimates, not obscurely, that the hope\n                                of Aigina rests on the transmitted virtues of her noble stock."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "The next world."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "1", "bibl": {"@n": "Pind.

We have not to do with the\n                                nave. Pindar is profoundly self-conscious, and his witness\n                                concerning himself is true. He distinctly claims for himself\n                                elevation, opulence, force, cunning workmanship, vigorous execution. In what seems to moderns almost unlovely\n                                self-assertion, he vindicates his rank as a poet just as he would\n                                vindicate his rank as an aristocrat. He is an eagle, his rivals are\n                                ravens and daws (; \n                                ). Bellerophon shooting his\n                                arrows from the lone bosom of the chill ether () is a prefigurement of his\n                                poetic exaltation, his power, his directness, and so he never\n                                wearies of calling his songs arrows or darts (; ; ; ; . ; ), which sometimes fall in a\n                                hurtling shower; but sometimes a single arrow hits the mark,\n                                sometimes a strong bolt is kept in reserve by the Muse, for Pindar,\n                                as an aristocrat, is a man of reserves. Of the richness of his\n                                workmanship none is better aware than he. The work of the poet is a\n                                Daedalian work, and the sinuous folds are wrought with rare skill\n                                    (), the art of art is\n                                selection and adornment, the production of a rich and compassed\n                                surface (). The splendor of\n                                the Goddesses of Triumphal Song irradiates him (), and he is a leader in the\n                                skill of poesy, which to him is by eminence wisdom (), wisdom in the art of the theme, and in the art of the\n                                treatment. Now how far does Pindar's account of himself correspond\n                                to the actual impression? What is the immediate effect of the\n                                detailed work of his poems, that detailed work by which he is at\n                                first more comprehensible? The detail of Pindar's odes produces,\n                                from the very outset of the study, an irresistible effect of\n                                opulence and elevation. Opulence is wealth that makes itself felt,\n                                that suggests, almost insultingly, a contrast, and that contrast is\n                                indigence. It is one half of an aristocrat, elevation being the\n                                other, so that in art as in thought, as in politics, as in religion,\n                                Pindar is true to his birth and to his order. This opulence, this\n                                abundance of resource, shows itself in strength and in splendor, for\n                                     is  is . The word splendor and all\n                                its synonyms seem to be made for Pindar. He drains dry the Greek\n                                vocabulary of words for light and bright, shine and shimmer, glitter\n                                and glister, ray and radiance, flame and flare and flash, gleam and\n                                glow, burn and blaze. The first Olympian begins with wealth and\n                                strength, with flaming fire of gold, and the shining star of  the sun. The fame of Hieron is resplendent, and the\n                                shoulder of Pelops gleams. No light like the light of the eye,\n                                thought the Greek, and the ancestors of Theron were the eye of\n                                Sicily, and Adrastos longs for the missing eye of his army. So the\n                                midmonth moon in her golden chariot flashed full the eye of evening\n                                into the face of Herakles. Wealth is not enough. It must be picked\n                                out, set off. It is not the uniform stare of a metallic surface, it\n                                must be adorned with the tracery that heightens the value of the\n                                background. Pindar delights in elaboration. His  itself, as we have seen,\n                                combines the two moral elements of the games . His lyre has a various range of\n                                notes, his quiver is full of arrows, and at times such is the shower\n                                of notes, such the rain of arrows, such the sparkle and flash and\n                                flame of the lights, such the sweet din and rumble and roar of the\n                                music of earth and the music of heaven, that the poet himself,\n                                overcome by the resources of his own art, confesses his defeat, and\n                                by one strong impulse of his light feet, swims out of the deluge of\n                                glory with which he has flooded the world of song. It requires strength\n                                to carry this opulence of splendor, but Pindar's opulence is the\n                                opulence of strength as well. He does not carve his bow with curious\n                                figures so deeply cut that at the drawing of the string the weapon\n                                snaps. His is not a sleepy but a vivid opulence, not a lazy but a\n                                swift opulence. Everything lives in his poems, everything is\n                                personified. Look at the magical way in which he lights up this\n                                great lamp of the architecture of his Odeon in the first Pythian.\n                                O Golden Lyre, joint heirloom of Apollo and the Muses  violet-tressed, thou for whom the step, the\n                                dancer's step, listeneth. Obeyeth\n                                seems too faint. We see the foot poised, tremulously listening for\n                                the notes of the phorminx, as if it had a hearing of its own. A few\n                                verses further down, snowy Aitna, nursing the livelong\n                                year the biting snow, not \n                                snow, as it has been rendered. It is not hers. It has\n                                come down to her from Heaven.

This has been practically the conclusion\n                                of the editors of Pindar from Erasmus Schmid, with his formidable\n                                rhetorical analysis of the odes, down to Mezger, with his\n                                reinforcement of the Terpandrian . This Terpandrian , mentioned in Pollux 4, 66, and touched on by\n                                    Bckh,\n                                contains seven parts:  Westphal\n                                identified with the old-fashioned  he changed into  being the same as , and he applied the Terpandrian scheme in\n                                this form to the odes of Pindar as well as to the choruses of\n                                    Aischylos. In the same year Moriz Schmidt published\n                                his translation of the Olympian odes divided into the members of the\n                                Terpandrian , and in Mezger's\n                                commentary on Pindar (1880) much space has been given to the\n                                advocacy of the scheme. Pindar,\n                                says Mezger in substance, composed his poems for oral delivery, and\n                                consequently wished to be understood at once. But even to his\n                                contemporaries, in spite of all their advantages, the immediate\n                                comprehension of his poems would have been impossible if they had\n                                not had some outside help. Of these extraneous aids, three, melody,\n                                musical accompaniment, and dance, are lost for us irrecoverably. But\n                                there was a tradition, a fixed norm for such compositions, a\n                                     from which the  must not vary, a  not only for the contents, but\n                                also for the form. To be sure, the old interpreters in their\n                                blindness knew nothing of this; but Bckh and Dissen\n                                observed  certain laws of structure, certain\n                                recurrences, certain symmetrical responses. Thiersch proved the\n                                triple division : but it was reserved for\n                                Westphal to set forth and establish the proposition that Aischylos,\n                                in the composition of his choruses, and Pindar, in that of his\n                                    , followed the  of Terpander with its sevenfold\n                                division. This Mezger considers Westphal to have made evident for\n                                all the forty-four odes except eight, at least so far as the three\n                                principal parts are concerned; and these principal parts are\n                                 beginning, middle, and end. But the establishment of\n                                these principal parts does not carry us beyond Thiersch.

After\n                                his encounter with Korinna there is almost a dead silence from\n                                without. Those who have ears to hear  and every modern\n                                critic is a Fine-ear  may detect the sound of growth from\n                                within. Besides, we have the advantage of a certain number of fixed\n                                points. We know the dates of a fair proportion of Pindar's\n                                forty-four odes, and we may construct the curve of his rise, and, if\n                                it must be said, of his decline. The department, too, seems to favor\n                                such a study, for Pindar was a lyric poet; and a lyric poet, it is\n                                thought, would be the first to show the traces of personal\n                                experience. But antique lyric is not modern lyric. Even Roman lyric\n                                is not Greek lyric. The Horace of the Odes is not the same as the\n                                Horace of the  Epodes; but it does not follow\n                                irresistibly that we can as easily distinguish between the Pindar of\n                                the tenth Pythian and the Pindar of the fourth Olympian. It may be\n                                going too far to say that the law of the department, the lyric\n                                    , was so much stronger\n                                than the individual that the personal development does not count.\n                                The personal development does count, and it is a legitimate and\n                                fascinating study, but the danger of importing into the result\n                                     conclusions is manifest.\n                                Once fix in the mind the characteristic stages, and the inevitable\n                                tendency is to force the phenomena, no matter how stubborn they may\n                                be, into the places which they are supposed to fit. Of youth we\n                                expect exuberance of language, unassimilated wealth of thought,\n                                rashness of imagery, a technic that betrays, both by its mechanical\n                                adherence to rule and by its violation of principle, the recent\n                                influence of the school, and the rebellion against it. Of matured\n                                power we expect a balance of forces; the imagination is steadier,\n                                the thought deeper, the interpenetration of form and matter is more\n                                complete, the plan is organic, the poem grows symmetrically up to\n                                its full height; there are fewer surprises, and the technic has\n                                become a second nature without the dulness of routine. The man is at\n                                his best. The closing stage shows perfect mastery of form still, but\n                                the effects are produced with less expenditure of power, there is\n                                not the same joy of surplus vitality, the word\n                                dexterity comes in too often when we applaud,\n                                the plan is a scheme. Now while some such course may be laid down in\n                                general for the track of lyric genius, the very essence of genius,\n                                which is the unforeseen, disappoints calculation at every turn.\n                                There are some minds in which there is no trace of crudeness at any\n                                age. There are revivals of youth in poetry as in life, revivals that\n                                scandalize critics of art as well as critics of morals. Of all\n                                students of Pindar, Leopold Schmidt has bestowed most attention on this\n                                subject,  but in spite of his thoughtful study and his\n                                sympathetic discernment, the results reached are not satisfactory.\n                                The period of\n                                immaturity is too long, and the evidence of immaturity too slight.\n                                The great poets of the world do not wait until the Suabian age of\n                                discretion  which is forty  before they reach\n                                their prime. Of the seven dated poems assigned to this period three\n                                are on the border of Pindar's perfect art, so that we are\n                                practically left to make up our characteristics of this stadium from\n                                P. 10, 6, 12, and 7. We are told that Pindar's first commissions\n                                came from Thebes. Nothing would seem to be more likely. But the odes\n                                give no evidence of it. The Thebans may have employed him at their\n                                local games, but the victors of the earlier odes are from Thessaly,\n                                Akragas, Athens, Epizephyrian Lokris, and Aigina. We are told that\n                                Pindar must have known Aigina from his youth up, and no one\n                                questions his intimate knowledge of the island, his deep interest in\n                                its fortunes. One fourth of all the odes celebrate Aiginetans, but\n                                the first Aiginetan ode is the last of this period of immaturity.\n                                True, not without significance is the close connection with Delphi\n                                and the consequent predominance of Pythian odes at this period, and\n                                it was doubtless a proud moment in the poet's life when he received\n                                his first Olympian commission, and if the longer ode on Agesidamos,\n                                O. 10 (11), is the fulfilment of that commission, it may be\n                                pardonable to see a certain jubilation in its tone; but it is\n                                extravagant to attempt the reconciliation between the joyous tone\n                                and the long delay by the supposition that the poet was too much\n                                overcome by his emotion to do the theme immediate justice. The\n                                distinction between the earlier poems and the poems of the period of\n                                maturity, as marked by the prominence given to the grace of a\n                                special god in the latter, seems to be shadowy, and to have less in\n                                its favor than the criticism that there is a lack of unity in the\n                                composition of the earlier poems.  Unfortunately the\n                                relation of myth to theme is not yet put on an impregnable basis,\n                                and what Schmidt says of the earlier poems has been said by others\n                                of the ripest. It is easy to say that there is no interpenetration\n                                of myth and thought, that the actual present is not yet merged in\n                                the mythic past, that we have only striking situations, no\n                                development, and hence no psychological interest. The trouble is to\n                                vindicate perfection for the others. The handling of the metres in\n                                the different periods is another matter that leaves ample margin for\n                                varying judgment. Schmidt maintains that the metre shifts from\n                                logaoedic to dactylo-epitrite without discernible reason, that the\n                                logaoedic is more freely handled as the poet develops, and that the\n                                dactylo-epitrite is not thoroughly mastered until the close of the\n                                period. Here, again, the basis of induction is too narrow, the\n                                     is too\n                                potent an element."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Second period."}, "#text": "The second period, according to Schmidt, extends from Pindar's\n                                fortieth to his sixty-fifth year  a stirring time.

Thebes was\n                                severely chastised for her adherence to the Persians, and the\n                                dominant aristocratic party sorely humiliated. It is supposed\n                                 it is a mere supposition  that Pindar, though\n                                of the nobility, was not with the nobility; that his vision had\n                                widened. The aristocracy was no longer the only form of government\n                                worthy of the name, and so he was fitted by nature and insight to\n                                act as a mediator between extremes. And yet it would be hard to\n                                prove from Pindar's poems that he ever had a reasonable sympathy\n                                with democracy anywhere. There was no call for such sympathy. The\n                                victors in the games were all of his own order."}, {"pb": {"@n": "lxi"}, "#text": "In this second period Pindar's reputation extended more and more; the\n                                princes of the earth sought the honor of being glorified by him.\n                                When he was fifty he yielded to Hieron's solicitations and paid a\n                                visit to Syracuse.

A personal acquaintance with Athens is not unlikely, though\n                                by no means certain. The high praise that he bestowed upon the city\n                                is referred by Schmidt to the time between the second Persian war\n                                and his visit to Syracuse. The relations between the Dorians and the\n                                Athenians became more tense afterwards, and Schmidt himself\n                                acknowledges that as Pindar grew older he went back to the faith of\n                                his fathers, the aristocratic creed in which he was nursed."}, "Pindar's rise in national estimation gave him a higher selfesteem.

It is absurd to see\n                                any freedom in his calling Hieron friend. His\n                                own achievements and the achievements of the Persian war are\n                                supposed to have led him to higher views of human power. Success in\n                                the games is not due to fortune or to fate, but rather to the\n                                victor's own prowess, the victor's own zeal, the victor's family\n                                record, especially in its religious aspects, to the favor of a\n                                special deity, and chiefly to the favor of Apollo.

The attempt\n                                has been made in this edition to follow the growth of the odes in\n                                the poet's mind. A general  plan there was, doubtless,\n                                in each poem; but it was not a rigid scheme, and shaped itself into\n                                graceful variations as the poet wrought at his work. The myth grew\n                                out of the theme, its heart or head, as the herb in Isabella's Pot\n                                of Basil. We must have suggestion, play, sweep, or we have no\n                                poetry. Now, according to Schmidt, it is only in this period that we\n                                have any such organic unity; it is only in this period that he sees\n                                the happy co-operation of imagination and plastic force. Yet even\n                                here he notices a difference. After fifty the significance of each\n                                poem may be summed up in a formula; before, the fundamental notion\n                                is so incarnate that we cannot dissect it out. But no high poetry is\n                                exhausted by its recurrent burdens, its catch-words, its key-verses,\n                                just as no high poetry is in any sense translatable."}, {"foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "a\n                                priori"}, "#text": "The advance in the art of the narrative is another point where we\n                                have to encounter the danger of  characterization, and the difficulty of a narrow\n                                range of observation.

Which\n                                are the easier odes? Not the shorter ones necessarily, for the\n                                fourth Pythian, the longest of all, is one of the easiest, and the\n                                fourteenth Olympian, one of the shortest, has given the commentators\n                                much trouble. The fact is, a man who has read himself into Pindar is\n                                a poor judge of the relative difficulty of the odes unless he has\n                                made actual trial in the class-room, and the experience of most\n                                lovers of Pindar has of necessity been limited, as Pindar has seldom\n                                been read in our colleges. And yet it might be safe to recommend\n                                some such course as this. For the beginning, within the range of\n                                Olympians and Pythians, O. 12, 11 (10)  the short ode for\n                                Agesidamos  then O. 3, 6, 7; P. 3, 4; for the\n                                culmination, whatever else may lie between, O. 1, 2; P. 2. This\n                                advice is based purely on the relative difficulty, but those who\n                                know Pindar will see at once that the easier odes are\n                                dactylo-epitrite, the harder odes are logaoedic or paionian. Of\n                                course it is not to be expected that the student will be satisfied\n                                with so long a course of dactylo-epitrites, but the lesson is this:\n                                If any ode of Pindar is to be studied as a work of art, it is to be\n                                approached as a work of art, and the first thing to be mastered, not\n                                theoretically, but practically, is the form. A good recitation will\n                                be found of far greater value than much discourse about the\n                                atmosphere of the  The poem must be read\n                                rhythmically over and over until it can be read \n                                fluently aloud, and this must precede the intellectual study. Then,\n                                of course, the vocabulary must be looked after, though the Pindaric\n                                vocabulary is not very troublesome; thereupon the commentary, and\n                                finally the introduction, by way of review. When the rhythm is\n                                mastered, it will be found that the way is open for the appreciation\n                                of the meaning of the poem in its parts and as a whole. The stress\n                                falls on the summits of the thought. Words are not divorced that are\n                                bound together by rhythm, no matter how widely they are separated to\n                                the eye. Key-notes make themselves heard. The welding of masses\n                                makes itself felt. The confused figures group themselves into\n                                patterns, and out of the darkness, as out of a picture of Rembrandt,\n                                the remotest forms come forth to the vision. Then it will be soon\n                                enough to bring in the historical apparatus, soon enough, if it is\n                                ever soon enough, to bring in the metaphysical analysis, the logical\n                                skeleton, which is supposed to exhibit the organism of the ode,\n                                though vertebrae and ribs and thigh-bones are often missing, to say\n                                nothing of the head."}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "kw=lon"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "h)=qos"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "aem", "ref": {"@target": "i1s2", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "the introduction to this edition"}, "#text": "The metrical system\n                                    outlined here is no longer in use.

To\n                                the average reader, however, the position of words is chiefly of\n                                interest, so far as it gives emphasis to the leading elements, and\n                                in this respect the study of the rhythms aids very much in removing\n                                the difficulties that the beginner may find. In the equable measures\n                                of the dactylo-epitrites the separation of the words gives very\n                                little trouble. Our minds are attuned to the leisurely motion, and\n                                we can afford to wait. The stress - points of the verse signal to\n                                one another. No matter what the distance between beginning and end\n                                of a verse, they are never really far apart, and then again the\n                                meaning is often to be gathered from the edge of the ode in a manner\n                                of acrostic. The attention is often kept alive by suspense, the\n                                object being held back as if it were the answer to a riddle, and\n                                this very suspense serves to preserve the organic unity as well as\n                                to bind epode more closely to antistrophe. Sometimes when the\n                                thought seems to have reached its legitimate end, a message follows,\n                                a momentous codicil to the poetic testament, a condition, a\n                                restriction. Sometimes again a word is  held by the\n                                power of the rhythm until it penetrates the whole structure.\n                                Sometimes the poet strikes sharply two or three notes that convey to\n                                the student the movement of the whole, and O. 2 and P. 5 give up\n                                their secret to the skilled in song. All this is capable of\n                                demonstration, but it is a weariness to demonstrate what every one\n                                who attacks Pindar resolutely will soon find out for himself.

Evidently a roving, and doubtless a quarrelsome, race, the\n                                descendants of Thersandros went successively to Sparta, to Thera, to\n                                Rhodes, and finally to Akragas. Such was the ancestry of Theron, who\n                                made himself master of Akragas by a trick, which he is said to have\n                                redeemed by a just, mild, and beneficent reign. Under his rule\n                                Akragas reached its highest eminence, and Theron's sway extended to\n                                the neighborhood of Himera and the Tyrrhenian sea. When he drove out\n                                Terillos, tyrant of Himera, and seized his throne, Terillos applied\n                                to his son-in-law, Anaxilas of Rhegion, for help, who, in his turn,\n                                invoked the aid of the Carthaginians. Thereupon Theron summoned to\n                                his assistance his son-in-law, Gelon, of Syracuse, and in the famous\n                                battle of Himera the Sicilian princes gained a brilliant victory.\n                                (See ) The\n                                enormous booty was spent on the adornment of Syracuse and Akragas.\n                                Akragas became one of the most beautiful cities  of the\n                                world, and the ruins of Girgenti are still among the most imposing\n                                remains of antiquity. A few years after the battle of Himera, Gelon\n                                died, Ol. 75, 3 (478 B.C.), and was succeeded by his brother Hieron\n                                in the rule of Syracuse. To the other brother, Polyzelos, were\n                                assigned the command of the army and the hand of Damareta, daughter\n                                of Theron, widow of Gelon, with the guardianship of Gelon's son; but\n                                the two brothers had not been on the best terms before, and Hieron\n                                took measures to get rid of Polyzelos, who was a popular prince.\n                                Polyzelos took refuge with Theron, who had married his daughter, and\n                                who in consequence of this double tie refused to give him up to\n                                Hieron. The Himeraians, oppressed by Theron's son Thrasydaios, made\n                                propositions to Hieron; two cousins of Theron, Kapys and\n                                Hippokrates, joined his enemies, and the armies of Hieron and Theron\n                                faced each other on the banks of the Gela. Thanks, however, to the\n                                good offices of the poet Simonides, peace was made; Polyzelos was\n                                suffered to return, and Hieron married the daughter of Xenokrates,\n                                brother of Theron.

When Pindar asks, What\n                                god, what hero, what man shall we celebrate? he means to\n                                celebrate all three, and god, hero, and man recur throughout: the\n                                god helping, the hero toiling, the man achieving.

But this is not\n                                all. Earthly bliss is not everything.

He has arrows enough in his quiver; he has power\n                                enough in his pinion. He can shoot, he can fly, whithersoever he\n                                will; and now, that we have left that other world, and have come\n                                back to this realm of Zeus, he bends his bow, he \n                                stoops his flight, to Akragas. Now he can praise Theron with all the\n                                solemnity but without the gloom of an epitaph, and the last words\n                                fall like a benediction on the gracious king (vv. 92110)."}, "There is no myth proper.

The Herakleidai\n                                occupied three cities of Rhodes, and established a triple kingdom.\n                                Those who inhabited Ialysos were called Eratidai, and this was the\n                                stock of Diagoras, who also counted among his ancestors a son-in-law\n                                of the famous Messenian leader, Aristomenes. The royal power of the\n                                Eratidai ceased after Ol. 30, and in the time of Pindar  ruled instead; and it is supposed\n                                that the father of Diagoras, Damagtos, was such a  Of an illustrious family,\n                                Diagoras won for himself unparalleled distinction as a boxer.\n                                Besides being victorious at many local games, he was successful at\n                                all the national games, and so became a . His sons emulated the head of the\n                                house. His youngest, Dorieus, had a career only less brilliant than\n                                that of his father. Damagtos won the pankration at\n                                Olympia, Akusilaos a boxing-match. The two sons of his daughters\n                                were also victors at Olympia, and one of his daughters enjoyed the\n                                exceptional privilege of being present at the Olympian games. The\n                                statue of Diagoras, surrounded by his three sons and two grandsons,\n                                the work of Kallikles of Megara, was erected at Olympia; and\n                                familiar is the story of the Spartan who, when he saw Diagoras borne\n                                on the shoulders of his two laurelled sons, exclaimed,\n                                Die, Diagoras, for thou canst not mount to\n                                heaven (). It is not known whether Diagoras followed the\n                                advice or lived to see the downfall of his family. Rhodes belonged\n                                to the Delian league. Two years before the victory here celebrated\n                                the battles of Eurymedon  were fought (466), and Athens\n                                was at the height of her power. Enemies of aristocratic government,\n                                the Athenians favored the commons as against the Doric aristocracy\n                                of Rhodes. Diagoras's son, Dorieus, fled to Thurioi, but returned\n                                and fought against the Athenians in his own ships, was captured, but\n                                liberated. Again exiled, he went to the Peloponnesos, where he was\n                                arrested by the Spartans and executed.

Apollo, son\n                                of Zeus, Poscidon, brother of Zeus, take Zeus's son Aiakos to Troy\n                                (v. 31). Then the poet tells the story of Aiakos to show what honor\n                                Zeus puts on his son. Aiakos is \n                                 to the gods (v. 32), and\n                                     (v. 16) is\n                                echoed in  (v. 83). So\n                                far the poem runs smoothly enough, and if the poet had returned to\n                                the victor after despatching Aiakos to Aigina, the ode would be less\n                                difficult; but the introduction of the trainer jars us, and, in\n                                fact, Pindar himself apologizes for it (v. 56). Timosthenes, who\n                                ordered the ode  Alkimedon is nowhere addressed, and his\n                                youth is emphasized  required this mention of Melesias,\n                                who must have been his trainer too; and so Pindar dwells on the\n                                importance of having an old athlete as a trainer both for man (v.\n                                63) and boy, both for Timosthenes and for Alkimedon. This brings\n                                Alkimedon forward again, but he is soon lost again in the mention of\n                                his race  in the mention of the dead sire, who hears in\n                                the other world the glory that has come to the house."}, "The prose line of thought would be: The blessing of Zeus on Aiakos\n                                was on children's children; and so the brothers, Timosthenes,\n                                trained by Melesias, and now Alkimedon, have gained the prize, at\n                                Nemea one, at Olympia the other, both in games of Zeus, and even in\n                                the lower world the gracious boon is not unknown.", "The poem is full of prayers, but Aigina was near the point when she\n                                would be past praying for.", "The rhythms are dactylo-epitrite.

The story as told by  Mezger, after\n                                    Bckh and Bossler, is as follows: Deukalion and Pyrrha,\n                                    grandchildren of Iapetos (compare Hor. ) escape the deluge by taking refuge on\n                                    Parnasos. When the waters subsided, by the devices of Zeus (v.\n                                    56), they descended from the mountain (v. 46) to Opus, where, in\n                                    consequence of an oracle of Zeus, they founded the first town\n                                    (v. 47), and made the Stone people. To these belonged\n                                    the hundred mothers from whom the Lokrian\n                                    nobles were descended, as, indeed, the prominence of women among\n                                    the Lokrians generally is a significant fact. The royal race to\n                                    which Epharmostos is supposed to have belonged traced their\n                                    descent from Deukalion and Pyrrha down to Lokros in the male\n                                    line, and from his adopted son Opus in the female. Lokros was\n                                    the last of his house, and the race was about to die out with\n                                    him, but Zeus carried off Protogeneia, daughter of Opus of Elis,\n                                    and granddaughter of Protogeneia, daughter of Deukalion and\n                                    Pyrrha; was united to her in the Mainalian mountains, and\n                                    brought her to the childless Lokros, her cousin, as his wife.\n                                    Lokros called the offspring of the younger Protogeneia after her\n                                    father Opus, and gave him the throne.

According to Bckh, the\n                                composition of the poem belongs to a much later period, Ol. 76, 3\n                                (474 B.C.). Earlier than Ol. 76, 1 (476 B.C.) it cannot be, for\n                                Hieron is called  (v.\n                                69), and Aitna was founded in that year. Later than Ol. 76, 3 it\n                                cannot well be, for in that year Hieron won a chariot-race at\n                                Delphi, of which no mention is made in this poem. Bckh\n                                thinks that the ode was composed shortly before P. 1, probably to\n                                celebrate the recurrent date of the previous victories. Hieron was\n                                suffering (compare ), and\n                                hence the blending of congratulation and consolation.

Hieron is victorious, but\n                                suffering, and he must learn that the gods give two pains for one\n                                pleasure, and be content to have only one against one. To expect\n                                more is to reach out to what is not and cannot be. To this lesson\n                                the poet leads up step by step. So in the very beginning of this ode\n                                he himself sets an example of the impatient yearning he condemns.\n                                Would that the old Centaur, the master of Asklepios, the\n                                great healer, were alive! A poet, Pindar longs for the\n                                control of leechcraft, and does not recognize his own ambition until\n                                other examples of disappointment pass before his eyes. Such an\n                                example is Koronis, mother of Asklepios. This was her sin: she had\n                                one love, she wanted yet another (v. 25). Asklepios himself comes\n                                next. He was a leech of wide renown  a benefactor to his\n                                kind  but he was a slave to gain (v. 54). This was his\n                                sin, and, like his mother, he perished  (v. 57). And\n                                now the poet draws the moral. Mortals must seek what is\n                                meet for mortals, and recognize where they stand, what is their\n                                fate. The wish is renewed, but this time with a sigh. The\n                                poet is not satisfied with paying Hieron his homage in music, he\n                                yearns to bring him the master of healing and gain a double share of\n                                favor. It must not be; he cannot cross the water with this double\n                                joy (v. 72). He must be content to stay at home and make vows to the\n                                goddess at his door (v. 77). This lesson Hieron and Hieron's poet\n                                must divide:    (v. 81). That is the rule. Make the best\n                                of it. Look at Peleus. Look at Kadmos (vv. 87, 88). They heard the\n                                Muses, as Hieron heard Pindar's songs. One married Harmonia, one\n                                Thetis (vv. 91, 92). Both saw the sons of Kronos banqueting with\n                                them, both received bridal gifts of the gods. But three daughters\n                                brought threefold sorrow to Kadmos. True, one daughter's couch was\n                                shared by Zeus (v. 99), yet this is only one joy to three sorrows.\n                                Against the bridal of Thetis set the death of Achilles (v. 100), an\n                                only son, and so more than a double sorrow. Enjoy, then,\n                                what thou mayest while thou mayest in the changing breezes of\n                                fortune, in the ticklish balance of prosperity. This be our creed.\n                                Fit thy will to God's will. Pray for wealth. Hope for fame. Fame\n                                rests on song. Nestor and Sarpedon  the one who lost his\n                                noble son, the other lost to a divine sire  live on in\n                                lays. Few achieve this (vv. 102115). And so the poem ends\n                                with the tacit pledge that Hieron shall live on in P.'s song as they\n                                in Homer's."}, "The rhythms are dactylo-epitrite (Dorian).", {"foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)pini/kion"}, "#text": "The distribution of the elements is different from that of an\n                                ordinary .

The lyric poet gives the main\n                                    result briefly in advance, and follows it up by a series of\n                                    pictures, each of which throws light on the preceding\n                                    (Mezger)."}}, {"@type": "commline", "@n": "9", "p": [{"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "pri\\n tele/ssai"}, "cit": {"bibl": {"@n": "Eur.

But the introduction is longer than it seems. The first\n                                three triads constitute an introductory epyllion  the\n                                Prophecy of Medeia  which bears a just proportion to the\n                                rest. Only if the usual measure were observed the myth would occupy\n                                seven triads and the conclusion three (3+7+3), but the story runs\n                                over into the eleventh triad, when the poet chides himself as having\n                                lingered too long (v. 247), and the slow imperfects give way to the\n                                rapid aorists.

Notice that the story of the\n                                Argonauts makes the same returning sweep to Arkesilas and Apollo as\n                                the Prophecy of Medeia (vv. 65, 66). Apollo is an oracular god, and\n                                speaks in riddles. So read me, the poet says,\n                                the riddle of Oidipus (v. 263). After this\n                                riddle is given, fulfil the word of Homer (v.\n                                277). Both Oidipus and Homer, be it noted, are Apollinic. The answer\n                                to the riddle is  Damophilos (v. 281); but it is not\n                                until the poet has claimed the good messenger's credit, according to\n                                the word of Homer, that he brings forth the name. The poem closes\n                                with a commendation of the banished nobleman, and with the evident\n                                intimation that this song was made at his desire (v. 299)."}, {"pb": {"@n": "281"}, "#text": "The myth itself (vv. 70-256) is natural enough.

The tarrying of the soul of Phrixos, the drifting\n                                of the clod, the long voyage of the Argonauts, may be symbolical of\n                                the banishment of Damophilos.

Are all these accessories\n                                    of fire and column mere adornments?

Why should not the wisdom of\n                                    Oidipus refer to the case of Oidipus himself? Oidipus\n                                    is uttering a parable for the benefit of those to whom he had\n                                    come as an exile. The parallel between the exiled Oidipus and\n                                    the exiled Damophilos is one that would not insult Arkesilas,\n                                    and the coincidences in detail between the oak and Oidipus are\n                                    evident enough. Like the oak, Oidipus has lost his branches, his\n                                    sons (), who, according\n                                    to one version of the legend, perished before their father, his\n                                    comeliness has been marred (), the place that knew him knows him no\n                                    more (), and yet, though his fruit perish (), he can\n                                    render services to an alien state, such services as are set\n                                    forth in the  of Sophokles.
