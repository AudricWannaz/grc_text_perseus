While these also write new histories about the Assyrians\nand Medes, as if the ancient writers had not described their affairs as\nthey ought to have done; although these be as far inferior to them in abilities\nas they are different in their notions from them. For of old every one\ntook upon them to write what happened in his own time; where their immediate\nconcern in the actions made their promises of value; and where it must\nbe reproachful to write lies, when they must be known by the readers to\nbe such.

And since Mithridates of Pergamus, with the forces\nhe led against Egypt, was excluded from the avenues about Pelusium, and\nwas forced to stay at Asealon, he persuaded the Arabians, among whom he\nhad lived, to assist him, and came himself to him, at the head of three\nthousand armed men. He also encouraged the men of power in Syria to come\nto his assistance, as also of the inhabitants of Libanus, Ptolemy, and\nJamblicus, and another Ptolemy; by which means the cities of that country\ncame readily into this war; insomuch that Mithridates ventured now, in\ndependence upon the additional strength that he had gotten by Antipater,\nto march forward to Pelusium; and when they refused him a passage through\nit, he besieged the city; in the attack of which place Antipater principally\nsignalized himself, for he brought down that part of the wall which was\nover against him, and leaped first of all into the city, with the men that\nwere about him.", "Thus was Pelusium taken. But still, as they were marching on, those\nEgyptian Jews that inhabited the country called the country of Onias stopped\nthem. Then did Antipater not only persuade them not to stop them, but to\nafford provisions for their army; on which account even the people about\nMemphis would not fight against them, but of their own accord joined Mithridates.\nWhereupon he went round about Delta, and fought the rest of the Egyptians\nat a place called the Jews' Camp; nay, when he was in danger in the battle\nwith all his right wing, Antipater wheeled about, and came along the bank\nof the river to him; for he had beaten those that opposed him as he led\nthe left wing. After which success he fell upon those that pursued Mithridates,\nand slew a great many of them, and pursued the remainder so far that he\ntook their camp, while he lost no more than fourscore of his own men; as\nMithridates lost, during the pursuit that was made after him, about eight\nhundred. He was also himself saved unexpectedly, and became an unreproachable\nwitness to Caesar of the great actions of Antipater.", "Whereupon Caesar encouraged Antipater to undertake other hazardous\nenterprises for him, and that by giving him great commendations and hopes\nof reward. In all which enterprises he readily exposed himself to many\ndangers, and became a most courageous warrior; and had many wounds almost\nall over his body, as demonstrations of his valor. And when Caesar had\nsettled the affairs of Egypt, and was returning into Syria again, he gave\nhim the privilege of a Roman citizen, and freedom from taxes, and rendered\nhim an object of admiration by the honors and marks of friendship he bestowed\nupon him. On this account it was that he also confirmed Hyrcanus in the\nhigh priesthood.", "ABOUT this time it was that Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus, came\nto Caesar, and became, in a surprising manner, the occasion of Antipater's\nfurther advancement; for whereas he ought to have lamented that his father\nappeared to have been poisoned on account of his quarrels with Pompey,\nand to have complained of Scipio's barbarity towards his brother, and not\nto mix any invidious passion when he was suing for mercy; besides those\nthings, he came before Caesar, and accused Hyrcanus and Antipater, how\nthey had driven him and his brethren entirely out of their native country,\nand had acted in a great many instances unjustly and extravagantly with\nrelation to their nation; and that as to the assistance they had sent him\ninto Egypt, it was not done out of good-will to him, but out of the fear\nthey were in from former quarrels, and in order to gain pardon for their\nfriendship to [his enemy] Pompey.", "Hereupon Antipater threw away his garments, and showed the multitude\nof the wounds he had, and said, that as to his good-will to Caesar, he\nhad no occasion to say a word, because his body cried aloud, though he\nsaid nothing himself; that he wondered at Antigonus's boldness, while he\nwas himself no other than the son of an enemy to the Romans, and of a fugitive,\nand had it by inheritance from his father to be fond of innovations and\nseditions, that he should undertake to accuse other men before the Roman\ngovernor, and endeavor to gain some advantages to himself, when he ought\nto be contented that he was suffered to live; for that the reason of his\ndesire of governing public affairs was not so much because he was in want\nof it, but because, if he could once obtain the same, he might stir up\na sedition among the Jews, and use what he should gain from the Romans\nto the disservice of those that gave it him.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "What is here noted by Hudson and Spanheim, that this grant of leave to\nrebuild the walls of the cities of Judea was made by Julius Caesar, not\nas here to Antipater, but to Hyrcanas, Antiq.

And, at the same time that he said this,\nhe settled the affairs of the country by himself, because he saw that Hyrcanus\nwas inactive, and not fit to manage the affairs of the kingdom. So he constituted\nhis eldest son, Phasaelus, governor of Jerusalem, and of the parts about\nit; he also sent his next son, Herod, who was very young, \nwith equal authority into Galilee."}, "Now Herod was an active man, and soon found proper materials for\nhis active spirit to work upon. As therefore he found that Hezekias, the\nhead of the robbers, ran over the neighboring parts of Syria with a great\nband of men, he caught him and slew him, and many more of the robbers with\nhim; which exploit was chiefly grateful to the Syrians, insomuch that hymns\nwere sung in Herod's commendation, both in the villages and in the cities,\nas having procured their quietness, and having preserved what they possessed\nto them; on which occasion he became acquainted with Sextus Caesar, a kinsman\nof the great Caesar, and president of Syria. A just emulation of his glorious\nactions excited Phasaelus also to imitate him. Accordingly, he procured\nthe good-will of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, by his own management of\nthe city affairs, and did not abuse his power in any disagreeable manner;\nwhence it came to pass that the nation paid Antipater the respects that\nwere due only to a king, and the honors they all yielded him were equal\nto the honors due to an absolute lord; yet did he not abate any part of\nthat good-will or fidelity which he owed to Hyrcanus.", "However, he found it impossible to escape envy in such his prosperity;\nfor the glory of these young men affected even Hyrcanus himself already\nprivately, though he said nothing of it to any body; but what he principally\nwas grieved at was the great actions of Herod, and that so many messengers\ncame one before another, and informed him of the great reputation he got\nin all his undertakings. There were also many people in the royal palace\nitself who inflamed his envy at him; those, I mean, who were obstructed\nin their designs by the prudence either of the young men, or of Antipater.\nThese men said, that by committing the public affairs to the management\nof Antipater and of his sons, he sat down with nothing but the bare name\nof a king, without any of its authority; and they asked him how long he\nwould so far mistake himself, as to breed up kings against his own interest;\nfor that they did not now conceal their government of affairs any longer,\nbut were plainly lords of the nation, and had thrust him out of his authority;\nthat this was the case when Herod slew so many men without his giving him\nany command to do it, either by word of mouth, or by his letter, and this\nin contradiction to the law of the Jews; who therefore, in case he be not\na king, but a private man, still ought to come to his trial, and answer\nit to him, and to the laws of his country, which do not permit any one\nto be killed till he hath been condemned in judgment.", "Now Hyrcanus was, by degrees, inflamed with these discourses, and\nat length could bear no longer, but he summoned Herod to take his trial.\nAccordingly, by his father's advice, and as soon as the affairs of Galilee\nwould give him leave, he came up to [Jerusalem], when he had first placed\ngarrisons in Galilee; however, he came with a sufficient body of soldiers,\nso many indeed that he might not appear to have with him an army able to\noverthrow Hyrcanus's government, nor yet so few as to expose him to the\ninsults of those that envied him. However, Sextus Caesar was in fear for\nthe young man, lest he should be taken by his enemies, and brought to punishment;\nso he sent some to denounce expressly to Hyrcanus that he should acquit\nHerod of the capital charge against him; who acquitted him accordingly,\nas being otherwise inclined also so to do, for he loved Herod.", "But Herod, supposing that he had escaped punishment without the consent\nof the king, retired to Sextus, to Damascus, and got every thing ready,\nin order not to obey him if he should summon him again; whereupon those\nthat were evil-disposed irritated Hyrcanus, and told him that Herod was\ngone away in anger, and was prepared to make war upon him; and as the king\nbelieved what they said, he knew not what to do, since he saw his antagonist\nwas stronger than he was himself. And now, since Herod was made general\nof Coelesyria and Samaria by Sextus Caesar, he was formidable, not only\nfrom the good-will which the nation bore him, but by the power he himself\nhad; insomuch that Hyrcanus fell into the utmost degree of terror, and\nexpected he would presently march against him with his army.", "Nor was he mistaken in the conjecture he made; for Herod got his\narmy together, out of the anger he bare him for his threatening him with\nthe accusation in a public court, and led it to Jerusalem, in order to\nthrow Hyrcanus down from his kingdom; and this he had soon done, unless\nhis father and brother had gone out together and broken the force of his\nfury, and this by exhorting him to carry his revenge no further than to\nthreatening and affrighting, but to spare the king, under whom he had been\nadvanced to such a degree of power; and that he ought not to be so much\nprovoked at his being tried, as to forget to be thankful that he was acquitted;\nnor so long to think upon what was of a melancholy nature, as to be ungrateful\nfor his deliverance; and if we ought to reckon that God is the arbitrator\nof success in war, an unjust cause is of more disadvantage than an army\ncan be of advantage; and that therefore he ought not to be entirely confident\nof success in a case where he is to fight against his king, his supporter,\nand one that had often been his benefactor, and that had never been severe\nto him, any otherwise than as he had hearkened to evil counselors, and\nthis no further than by bringing a shadow of injustice upon him. So Herod\nwas prevailed upon by these arguments, and supposed that what he had already\ndone was sufficient for his future hopes, and that he had enough shown\nhis power to the nation.", "In the mean time, there was a disturbance among the Romans about\nApamia, and a civil war occasioned by the treacherous slaughter of Sextus\nCaesar, by Cecilius Bassus, which he perpetrated out of his good-will to\nPompey; he also took the authority over his forces; but as the rest of\nCaesar's commanders attacked Bassus with their whole army, in order to\npunish him for the murder of Caesar, Antipater also sent them assistance\nby his sons, both on account of him that was murdered, and on account of\nthat Caesar who was still alive, both of which were their friends; and\nas this war grew to be of a considerable length, Marcus came out of Italy\nas successor to Sextus.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "In the Antiquities, B.

Now Herod, in the first place, mitigated the passion of Cassius,\nby bringing his share out of Galilee, which was a hundred talents, on which\naccount he was in the highest favor with him; and when he reproached the\nrest for being tardy, he was angry at the cities themselves; so he made\nslaves of Gophna and Emmaus, and two others of less note; nay, he proceeded\nas if he would kill Malichus, because he had not made greater haste in\nexacting his tribute; but Antipater prevented the ruin of this man, and\nof the other cities, and got into Cassius's favor by bringing in a hundred\ntalents immediately."}, "However, when Cassius was gone Malichus forgot the kindness that\nAntipater had done him, and laid frequent plots against him that had saved\nhim, as making haste to get him out of the way, who was an obstacle to\nhis wicked practices; but Antipater was so much afraid of the power and\ncunning of the man, that he went beyond Jordan, in order to get an army\nto guard himself against his treacherous designs; but when Malichus was\ncaught in his plot, he put upon Antipater's sons by his impudence, for\nhe thoroughly deluded Phasaelus, who was the guardian of Jerusalem, and\nHerod who was intrusted with the weapons of war, and this by a great many\nexcuses and oaths, and persuaded them to procure his reconciliation to\nhis father. Thus was he preserved again by Antipater, who dissuaded Marcus,\nthe then president of Syria, from his resolution of killing Malichus, on\naccount of his attempts for innovation.", "Upon the war between Cassius and Brutus on one side, against the\nyounger Caesar [Augustus] and Antony on the other, Cassius and Marcus got\ntogether an army out of Syria; and because Herod was likely to have a great\nshare in providing necessaries, they then made him procurator of all Syria,\nand gave him an army of foot and horse. Cassius premised him also, that\nafter the war was over, he would make him king of Judea. But it so happened\nthat the power and hopes of his son became the cause of his perdition;\nfor as Malichus was afraid of this, he corrupted one of the king's cup-bearers\nwith money to give a poisoned potion to Antipater; so he became a sacrifice\nto Malichus's wickedness, and died at a feast. He was a man in other respects\nactive in the management of affairs, and one that recovered the government\nto Hyrcanus, and preserved it in his hands.", "However, Malichus, when lie was suspected ef poisoning Antipater,\nand when the multitude was angry with him for it, denied it, and made the\npeople believe he was not guilty. He also prepared to make a greater figure,\nand raised soldiers; for he did not suppose that Herod would be quiet,\nwho indeed came upon him with an army presently, in order to revenge his\nfather's death; but, upon hearing the advice of his brother Phasaelus,\nnot to punish him in an open manner, lest the multitude should fall into\na sedition, he admitted of Malichus's apology, and professed that he cleared\nhim of that suspicion; he also made a pompous funeral for his father.", "So Herod went to Samaria, which was then in a tumult, and settled\nthe city in peace; after which at the [Pentecost] festival, he returned\nto Jerusalem, having his armed men with him: hereupon Hyrcanus, at the\nrequest of Malichus, who feared his reproach, forbade them to introduce\nforeigners to mix themselves with the people of the country while they\nwere purifying themselves; but Herod despised the pretense, and him that\ngave that command, and came in by night. Upon which Malithus came to him,\nand bewailed Antipater; Herod also made him believe [he admitted of his\nlamentations as real], although he had much ado to restrain his passion\nat him; however, he did himself bewail the murder of his father in his\nletters to Cassius, who, on other accounts, also hated Malichus. Cassius\nsent him word back that he should avenge his father's death upon him, and\nprivately gave order to the tribunes that were under him, that they should\nassist Herod in a righteous action he was about.", "And because, upon the taking of Laodicea by Cassius, the men of power\nwere gotten together from all quarters, with presents and crowns in their\nhands, Herod allotted this time for the punishment of Malichus. When Malichus\nsuspected that, and was at Tyre, he resolved to withdraw his son privately\nfrom among the Tyrians, who was a hostage there, while he got ready to\nfly away into Judea; the despair he was in of escaping excited him to think\nof greater things; for he hoped that he should raise the nation to a revolt\nfrom the Romans, while Cassius was busy about the war against Antony, and\nthat he should easily depose Hyrcanus, and get the crown for himself.", "But fate laughed at the hopes he had; for Herod foresaw what he was\nso zealous about, and invited both Hyrcanus and him to supper; but calling\none of the principal servants that stood by him to him, he sent him out,\nas though it were to get things ready for supper, but in reality to give\nnotice beforehand about the plot that was laid against him; accordingly\nthey called to mind what orders Cassius had given them, and went out of\nthe city with their swords in their hands upon the sea-shore, where they\nencompassed Malichus round about, and killed him with many wounds. Upon\nwhich Hyrcanus was immediately aftrighted, till he swooned away and fell\ndown at the surprise he was in; and it was with difficulty that he was\nrecovered, when he asked who it was that had killed Malichus. And when\none of the tribunes replied that it was done by the command of Cassius,\"\nThen,\" said he, \"Cassius hath saved both me and my country, by\ncutting off one that was laying plots against them both.\" Whether\nhe spake according to his own sentiments, or whether his fear was such\nthat he was obliged to commend the action by saying so, is uncertain; however,\nby this method Herod inflicted punishment upon Malichus.", "WHEN Cassius was gone out of Syria, another sedition arose at Jerusalem,\nwherein Felix assaulted Phasaelus with an army, that he might revenge the\ndeath of Malichus upon Herod, by falling upon his brother. Now Herod happened\nthen to be with Fabius, the governor of Damascus, and as he was going to\nhis brother's assistance, he was detained by sickness; in the mean time,\nPhasaelus was by himself too hard for Felix, and reproached Hyrcanus on\naccount of his ingratitude, both for what assistance he had afforded Maliehus,\nand for overlooking Malichus's brother, when he possessed himself of the\nfortresses; for he had gotten a great many of them already, and among them\nthe strongest of them all, Masada.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Here we see that Cassius set tyrants over all Syria; so that his assisting\nto destroy Caesar does not seem to have proceeded from his true zeal for\npublic liberty, but from a desire to be a tyrant himself."}, "#text": "However, nothing could be sufficient for him against the force of\nHerod, who, as soon as he was recovered, took the other fortresses again,\nand drove him out of Masada in the posture of a supplicant; he also drove\naway Marion, the tyrant of the Tyrians, out of Galilee, when he had already\npossessed himself of three fortified places; but as to those Tyrians whom\nhe had caught, he preserved them all alive; nay, some of them he gave presents\nto, and so sent them away, and thereby procured good-will to himself from\nthe city, and hatred to the tyrant. Marion had indeed obtained that tyrannical\npower of Cassius, who set tyrants over all Syria \nand out of hatred to Herod it was that he assisted Antigonus, the son of\nAristobulus, and principally on Fabius's account, whom Antigonus had made\nhis assistant by money, and had him accordingly on his side when he made\nhis descent; but it was Ptolemy, the kinsman of Antigonus, that supplied\nall that he wanted."}, "When Herod had fought against these in the avenues of Judea, he was\nconqueror in the battle, and drove away Antigonus, and returned to Jerusalem,\nbeloved by every body for the glorious action he had done; for those who\ndid not before favor him did join themselves to him now, because of his\nmarriage into the family of Hyrcanus; for as he had formerly married a\nwife out of his own country of no ignoble blood, who was called Doris,\nof whom he begat Antipater; so did he now marry Mariamne, the daughter\nof Alexander, the son of Aristobulus, and the granddaughter of Hyrcanus,\nand was become thereby a relation of the king.", "But when Caesar and Antony had slain Cassius near Philippi, and Caesar\nwas gone to Italy, and Antony to Asia, amongst the rest of the cities which\nsent ambassadors to Antony unto Bithynia, the great men of the Jews came\nalso, and accused Phasaelus and Herod, that they kept the government by\nforce, and that Hyrcanus had no more than an honorable name.

Now as they were in their flight,\nmany joined themselves to him every day; and at a place called Thressa\nof Idumea his brother Joseph met him, and advised him to ease himself of\na great number of his followers, because Masada would not contain so great\na multitude, which were above nine thousand. Herod complied with this advice,\nand sent away the most cumbersome part of his retinue, that they might\ngo into Idumea, and gave them provisions for their journey; but he got\nsafe to the fortress with his nearest relations, and retained with him\nonly the stoutest of his followers; and there it was that he left eight\nhundred of his men as a guard for the women, and provisions sufficient\nfor a siege; but he made haste himself to Petra of Arabia.", "As for the Parthians in Jerusalem, they betook themselves to plundering,\nand fell upon the houses of those that were fled, and upon the king's palace,\nand spared nothing but Hyrcanus's money, which was not above three hundred\ntalents. They lighted on other men's money also, but not so much as they\nhoped for; for Herod having a long while had a suspicion of the perfidiousness\nof the barbarians, had taken care to have what was most splendid among\nhis treasures conveyed into Idumea, as every one belonging to him had in\nlike manner done also.

There is also another report about\nhis end, viz. that he recovered of that stroke, and that a surgeon, who\nwas sent by Antigonus to heal him, filled the wound with poisonous ingredients,\nand so killed him; whichsoever of these deaths he came to, the beginning\nof it was glorious. It is also reported that before he expired he was informed\nby a certain poor woman how Herod had escaped out of their hands, and that\nhe said thereupon, \"I now die with comfort, since I leave behind me\none alive that will avenge me of mine enemies.\"", "This was the death of Phasaelus; but the Parthians, although they\nhad failed of the women they chiefly desired, yet did they put the government\nof Jerusalem into the hands of Antigonus, and took away Hyrcanus, and bound\nhim, and carried him to Parthia.", "NOW Herod did the more zealously pursue his journey into Arabia,\nas making haste to get money of the king, while his brother was yet alive;\nby which money alone it was that he hoped to prevail upon the covetous\ntemper of the barbarians to spare Phasaelus; for he reasoned thus with\nhimself,: - that if the Arabian king was too forgetful of his father's\nfriendship with him, and was too covetous to make him a free gift, he would\nhowever borrow of him as much as might redeem his brother, and put into\nhis hands, as a pledge, the son of him that was to be redeemed. Accordingly\nhe led his brother's son along with him, who was of the age of seven years.\nNow he was ready to give three hundred talents for his brother, and intended\nto desire the intercession of the Tyrians, to get them accepted; however,\nfate had been too quick for his diligence; and since Phasaelus was dead,\nHerod's brotherly love was now in vain. Moreover, he was not able to find\nany lasting friendship among the Arabians; for their king, Malichus, sent\nto him immediately, and commanded him to return back out of his country,\nand used the name of the Parthians as a pretense for so doing, as though\nthese had denounced to him by their ambassadors to cast Herod out of Arabia;\nwhile in reality they had a mind to keep back what they owed to Antipater,\nand not be obliged to make requitals to his sons for the free gifts the\nfather had made them.

The contest also that he had with\nAntigonus was another inducement, and that of no less weight than the great\nregard he had for Herod; for he looked upon Antigonus as a seditious person,\nand an enemy of the Romans; and as for Caesar, Herod found him better prepared\nthan Antony, as remembering very fresh the wars he had gone through together\nwith his father, the hospitable treatment he had met with from him, and\nthe entire good-will he had showed to him; besides the activity which he\nsaw in Herod himself. So he called the senate together, wherein Messalas,\nand after him Atratinus, produced Herod before them, and gave a full account\nof the merits of his father, and his own good-will to the Romans. At the\nsame time they demonstrated that Antigonus was their enemy, not only because\nhe soon quarreled with them, but because he now overlooked the Romans,\nand took the government by the means of the Parthians. These reasons greatly\nmoved the senate; at which juncture Antony came in, and told them that\nit was for their advantage in the Parthian war that Herod should be king;\nso they all gave their votes for it. And when the senate was separated,\nAntony and Caesar went out, with Herod between them; while the consul and\nthe rest of the magistrates went before them, in order to offer sacrifices,\nand to lay the decree in the Capitol.

However, he easily recovered his relations again that\nwere in Masada, as well as the fortress Ressa, and then marched to Jerusalem,\nwhere the soldiers that were with Silo joined themselves to his own, as\ndid many out of the city, from a dread of his power.", "Now when he had pitched his camp on the west side of the city, the\nguards that were there shot their arrows and threw their darts at them,\nwhile others ran out in companies, and attacked those in the forefront;\nbut Herod commanded proclamation to be made at the wall, that he was come\nfor the good of the people and the preservation of the city, without any\ndesign to be revenged on his open enemies, but to grant oblivion to them,\nthough they had been the most obstinate against him. Now the soldiers that\nwere for Antigonus made a contrary clamor, and did neither permit any body\nto hear that proclamation, nor to change their party; so Antigonus gave\norder to his forces to beat the enemy from the walls; accordingly, they\nsoon threw their darts at them from the towers, and put them to flight.", "And here it was that Silo discovered he had taken bribes; for he\nset many of the soldiers to clamor about their want of necessaries, and\nto require their pay, in order to buy themselves food, and to demand that\nhe would lead them into places convenient for their winter quarters; because\nall the parts about the city were laid waste by the means of Antigonus's\narmy, which had taken all things away. By this he moved the army, and attempted\nto get them off the siege; but Herod went to the captains that were under\nSilo, and to a great many of the soldiers, and begged of them not to leave\nhim, who was sent thither by Caesar, and Antony, and the senate; for that\nhe would take care to have their wants supplied that very day. After the\nmaking of which entreaty, he went hastily into the country, and brought\nthither so great an abundance of necessaries, that he cut off all Silo's\npretenses; and in order to provide that for the following days they should\nnot want supplies, he sent to the people that were about Samaria (which\ncity had joined itself to him) to bring corn, and wine, and oil, and cattle\nto Jericho. When Antigonus heard of this, be sent some of his party with\norders to hinder, and lay ambushes for these collectors of corn. This command\nwas obeyed, and a great multitude of armed men were gathered together about\nJericho, and lay upon the mountains, to watch those that brought the provisions.\nYet was Herod not idle, but took with him ten cohorts, five of them were\nRomans, and five were Jewish cohorts, together with some mercenary troops\nintermixed among them, and besides those a few horsemen, and came to Jericho;\nand when he came, he found the city deserted, but that there were five\nhundred men, with their wives and children, who had taken possession of\nthe tops of the mountains; these he took, and dismissed them, while the\nRomans fell upon the rest of the city, and plundered it, having found the\nhouses full of all sorts of good things. So the king left a garrison at\nJericho, and came back, and sent the Roman army into those cities which\nwere come over to him, to take their winter quarters there, viz. into Judea,\n[or Idumea,] and Galilee, and Samaria. Antigonus also by bribes obtained\nof Silo to let a part of his army be received at Lydda, as a compliment\nto Antonius.", "SO the Romans lived in plenty of all things, and rested from war.\nHowever, Herod did not lie at rest, but seized upon Idumea, and kept it,\nwith two thousand footmen, and four hundred horsemen; and this he did by\nsending his brother Joseph thither, that no innovation might be made by\nAntigonus. He also removed his mother, and all his relations, who had been\nin Masada, to Samaria; and when he had settled them securely, he marched\nto take the remaining parts of Galilee, and to drive away the garrisons\nplaced there by Antigonus.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This Sepphoris, the metropolis of Galilee, so often mentioned by Josephus,\nhas coins still remaining, as Spanheim here informs us."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This way of speaking, \"after forty days,\" is interpreted by Josephus\nhimself, \"on the fortieth day,\" Antiq.

Accordingly, he sent beforehand three\ncohorts of footmen, and one troop of horsemen, to the village Arbela, and\ncame himself forty days afterwards \nwith the rest of his forces Yet were not the enemy aftrighted at his assault\nbut met him in arms; for their skill was that of warriors, but their boldness\nwas the boldness of robbers: when therefore it came to a pitched battle,\nthey put to flight Herod's left wing with their right one; but Herod, wheeling\nabout on the sudden from his own right wing, came to their assistance,\nand both made his own left wing return back from its flight, and fell upon\nthe pursuers, and cooled their courage, till they could not bear the attempts\nthat were made directly upon them, and so turned back and ran away."}, "But Herod followed them, and slew them as he followed them, and destroyed\na great part of them, till those that remained were scattered beyond the\nriver [Jordan;] and Galilee was freed from the terrors they had been under,\nexcepting from those that remained, and lay concealed in caves, which required\nlonger time ere they could be conquered. In order to which Herod, in the\nfirst place, distributed the fruits of their former labors to the soldiers,\nand gave every one of them a hundred and fifty drachmae of silver, and\na great deal more to their commanders, and sent them into their winter\nquarters. He also sent to his youngest brother Pheroas, to take care of\na good market for them, where they might buy themselves provisions, and\nto build a wall about Alexandrium; who took care of both those injunctions\naccordingly.", "In the mean time Antony abode at Athens, while Ventidius called for\nSilo and Herod to come to the war against the Parthians, but ordered them\nfirst to settle the affairs of Judea; so Herod willingly dismissed Silo\nto go to Ventidius, but he made an expedition himself against those that\nlay in the caves. Now these caves were in the precipices of craggy mountains,\nand could not be come at from any side, since they had only some winding\npathways, very narrow, by which they got up to them; but the rock that\nlay on their front had beneath it valleys of a vast depth, and of an almost\nperpendicular declivity; insomuch that the king was doubtful for a long\ntime what to do, by reason of a kind of impossibility there was of attacking\nthe place. Yet did he at length make use of a contrivance that was subject\nto the utmost hazard; for he let down the most hardy of his men in chests,\nand set them at the mouths of the dens. Now these men slew the robbers\nand their families, and when they made resistance, they sent in fire upon\nthem [and burnt them]; and as Herod was desirous of saving some of them,\nhe had proclamation made, that they should come and deliver themselves\nup to him; but not one of them came willingly to him; and of those that\nwere compelled to come, many preferred death to captivity. And here a certain\nold man, the father of seven children, whose children, together with their\nmother, desired him to give them leave to go out, upon the assurance and\nright hand that was offered them, slew them after the following manner:\nHe ordered every one of them to go out, while he stood himself at the cave's\nmouth, and slew that son of his perpetually who went out. Herod was near\nenough to see this sight, and his bowels of compassion were moved at it,\nand he stretched out his right hand to the old man, and besought him to\nspare his children; yet did not he relent at all upon what he said, but\nover and above reproached Herod on the lowness of his descent, and slew\nhis wife as well as his children; and when he had thrown their dead bodies\ndown the precipice, he at last threw himself down after them.", "By this means Herod subdued these caves, and the robbers that were\nin them. He then left there a part of his army, as many as he thought sufficient\nto prevent any sedition, and made Ptolemy their general, and returned to\nSamaria; he led also with him three thousand armed footmen, and six hundred\nhorsemen, against Antigonus. Now here those that used to raise tumults\nin Galilee, having liberty so to do upon his departure, fell unexpectedly\nupon Ptolemy, the general of his forces, and slew him; they also laid the\ncountry waste, and then retired to the bogs, and to places not easily to\nbe found. But when Herod was informed of this insurrection, he came to\nthe assistance of the country immediately, and destroyed a great number\nof the seditions, and raised the sieges of all those fortresses they had\nbesieged; he also exacted the tribute of a hundred talents of his enemies,\nas a penalty for the mutations they had made in the country.", "By this time (the Parthians being already driven out of the country,\nand Pacorus slain) Ventidius, by Antony's command, sent a thousand horsemen,\nand two legions, as auxiliaries to Herod, against Antigonus. Now Antigonus\nbesought Macheras, who was their general, by letter, to come to his assistance,\nand made a great many mournful complaints about Herod's violence, and about\nthe injuries he did to the kingdom; and promised to give him money for\nsuch his assistance; but he complied not with his invitation to betray\nhis trust, for he did not contemn him that sent him, especially while Herod\ngave him more money [than the other offered]. So he pretended friendship\nto Antigonus, but came as a spy to discover his affairs; although he did\nnot herein comply with Herod, who dissuaded him from so doing. But Antigonus\nperceived what his intentions were beforehand, and excluded him out of\nthe city, and defended himself against him as against an enemy, from the\nwalls; till Macheras was ashamed of what he had done, and retired to Emmaus\nto Herod; and as he was in a rage at his disappointment, he slew all the\nJews whom he met with, without sparing those that were for Herod, but using\nthem all as if they were for Antigonus.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This Samosata, the metropolis of Commagena, is well known from its coins,\nas Spanheim here assures us.

However, Herod\ndid not desist from his resolution of going to Antony; but when he heard\nthat he was besieging Samosata \nwith a great army, which is a strong city near to Euphrates, he made the\ngreater haste; as observing that this was a proper opportunity for showing\nat once his courage, and for doing what would greatly oblige Antony. Indeed,\nwhen he came, he soon made an end of that siege, and slew a great number\nof the barbarians, and took from them a large prey; insomuch that Antony,\nwho admired his courage formerly, did now admire it still more. Accordingly,\nhe heaped many more honors upon him, and gave him more assured hopes that\nhe should gain his kingdom; and now king Antiochus was forced to deliver\nup Samosata."}, "IN the mean time, Herod's affairs in Judea were in an ill state.\nHe had left his brother Joseph with full power, but had charged him to\nmake no attempts against Antigonus till his return; for that Macheras would\nnot be such an assistant as he could depend on, as it appeared by what\nhe had done already; but as soon as Joseph heard that his brother was at\na very great distance, he neglected the charge he had received, and marched\ntowards Jericho with five cohorts, which Macheras sent with him. This movement\nwas intended for seizing on the corn, as it was now in the midst of summer;\nbut when his enemies attacked him in the mountains, and in places which\nwere difficult to pass, he was both killed himself, as he was very bravely\nfighting in the battle, and the entire Roman cohorts were destroyed; for\nthese cohorts were new-raised men, gathered out of Syria, and here was\nno mixture of those called veteran soldiers among them, who might have\nsupported those that were unskillful in war.", "This victory was not sufficient for Antigonus; but he proceeded to\nthat degree of rage, as to treat the dead body of Joseph barbarously; for\nwhen he had got possession of the bodies of those that were slain, he cut\noff his head, although his brother Pheroras would have given fifty talents\nas a price of redemption for it. And now the affairs of Galilee were put\nin such disorder after this victory of Antigonus's, that those of Antigonus's\nparty brought the principal men that were on Herod's side to the lake,\nand there drowned them. There was a great change made also in Idumea, where\nMacheras was building a wall about one of the fortresses, which was called\nGittha. But Herod had not yet been informed of these things; for after\nthe taking of Samosata, and when Antony had set Sosius over the affairs\nof Syria, and had given him orders to assist Herod against Antigonus, he\ndeparted into Egypt; but Sosius sent two legions before him into Judea\nto assist Herod, and followed himself soon after with the rest of his army.", "Now when Herod was at Daphne, by Antioch, he had some dreams which\nclearly foreboded his brother's death; and as he leaped out of his bed\nin a disturbed manner, there came messengers that acquainted him with that\ncalamity. So when he had lamented this misfortune for a while, he put off\nthe main part of his mourning, and made haste to march against his enemies;\nand when he had performed a march that was above his strength, and was\ngone as far as Libanus, he got him eight hundred men of those that lived\nnear to that mountain as his assistants, and joined with them one Roman\nlegion, with which, before it was day, he made an irruption into Galilee,\nand met his enemies, and drove them back to the place which they had left.\nHe also made an immediate and continual attack upon the fortress. Yet was\nhe forced by a most terrible storm to pitch his camp in the neighboring\nvillages before he could take it. But when, after a few days' time, the\nsecond legion, that came from Antony, joined themselves to him, the enemy\nwere aftrighted at his power, and left their fortifications ill the night\ntime.", "After this he marched through Jericho, as making what haste he could\nto be avenged on his brother's murderers; where happened to him a providential\nsign, out of which, when he had unexpectedly escaped, he had the reputation\nof being very dear to God; for that evening there feasted with him many\nof the principal men; and after that feast was over, and all the guests\nwere gone out, the house fell down immediately. And as he judged this to\nbe a common signal of what dangers he should undergo, and how he should\nescape them in the war that he was going about, he, in the morning, set\nforward with his army, when about six thousand of his enemies came running\ndown from the mountains, and began to fight with those in his forefront;\nyet durst they not be so very bold as to engage the Romans hand to hand,\nbut threw stones and darts at them at a distance; by which means they wounded\na considerable number; in which action Herod's own side was wounded with\na dart.", "Now as Antigonus had a mind to appear to exceed Herod, not only in\nthe courage, but in the number of his men, he sent Pappus, one of his companions,\nwith an army against Samaria, whose fortune it was to oppose Macheras;\nbut Herod overran the enemy's country, and demolished five little cities,\nand destroyed two thousand men that were in them, and burned their houses,\nand then returned to his camp; but his head-quarters were at the village\ncalled Cana.", "Now a great multitude of Jews resorted to him every day, both out\nof Jericho and the other parts of the country. Some were moved so to do\nout of their hatred to Antigonus, and some out of regard to the glorious\nactions Herod had done; but others were led on by an unreasonable desire\nof change; so he fell upon them immediately. As for Pappus and his party,\nthey were not terrified either at their number or at their zeal, but marched\nout with great alacrity to fight them; and it came to a close fight. Now\nother parts of their army made resistance for a while; but Herod, running\nthe utmost hazard, out of the rage he was in at the murder of his brother,\nthat he might be avenged on those that had been the authors of it, soon\nbeat those that opposed him; and after he had beaten them, he always turned\nhis force against those that stood to it still, and pursued them all; so\nthat a great slaughter was made, while some were forced back into that\nvillage whence they came out; he also pressed hard upon the hindermost,\nand slew a vast number of them; he also fell into the village with the\nenemy, where every house was filled with armed men, and the upper rooms\nwere crowded above with soldiers for their defense; and when he had beaten\nthose that were on the outside, he pulled the houses to pieces, and plucked\nout those that were within; upon many he had the roofs shaken down, whereby\nthey perished by heaps; and as for those that fled out of the ruins, the\nsoldiers received them with their swords in their hands; and the multitude\nof those slain and lying on heaps was so great, that the conquerors could\nnot pass along the roads. Now the enemy could not bear this blow, so that\nwhen the multitude of them which was gathered together saw that those in\nthe village were slain, they dispersed themselves, and fled away; upon\nthe confidence of which victory, Herod had marched immediately to Jerusalem,\nunless he tad been hindered by the depth of winter's [coming on]. This\nwas the impediment that lay in the way of this his entire glorious progress,\nand was what hindered Antigonus from being now conquered, who was already\ndisposed to forsake the city.", "Now when at the evening Herod had already dismissed his friends to\nrefresh themselves after their fatigue, and when he was gone himself, while\nhe was still hot in his armor, like a common soldier, to bathe himself,\nand had but one servant that attended him, and before he was gotten into\nthe bath, one of the enemies met him in the face with a sword in his hand,\nand then a second, and then a third, and after that more of them; these\nwere men who had run away out of the battle into the bath in their armor,\nand they had lain there for some time in, great terror, and in privacy;\nand when they saw the king, they trembled for fear, and ran by him in a\nflight, although he was naked, and endeavored to get off into the public\nroad. Now there was by chance nobody else at hand that might seize upon\nthese men; and for Herod, he was contented to have come to no harm himself,\nso that they all got away in safety.", "But on the next day Herod had Pappus's head cut off, who was the\ngeneral for Antigonus, and was slain in the battle, and sent it to his\nbrother Pheroras, by way of punishment for their slain brother; for he\nwas the man that slew Joseph. Now as winter was going off, Herod marched\nto Jerusalem, and brought his army to the wall of it; this was the third\nyear since he had been made king at Rome; so he pitched his camp before\nthe temple, for on that side it might be besieged, and there it was that\nPompey took the city. So he parted the work among the army, and demolished\nthe suburbs, end raised three banks, and gave orders to have towers built\nupon those banks, and left the most laborious of his acquaintance at the\nworks. But he went himself to Samaria, to take the daughter of Alexander,\nthe son of Aristobulus, to wife, who had been betrothed to him before,\nas we have already said; and thus he accomplished this by the by, during\nthe siege of the city, for he had his enemies in great contempt already.", "When he had thus married Mariamne, he came back to Jerusalem with\na greater army. Sosius also joined him with a large army, both of horsemen\nand footmen, which he sent before him through the midland parts, while\nhe marched himself along Phoenicia; and when the whole army was gotten\ntogether, which were eleven regiments of footmen, and six thousand horsemen,\nbesides the Syrian auxiliaries, which were no small part of the army, they\npitched their camp near to the north wall. Herod's dependence was upon\nthe decree of the senate, by which he was made king; and Sosius relied\nupon Antony, who sent the army that was under him to Herod's assistance.", "NOW the multitude of the Jews that were in the city were divided\ninto several factions; for the people that crowded about the temple, being\nthe weaker part of them, gave it out that, as the times were, he was the\nhappiest and most religious man who should die first. But as to the more\nbold and hardy men, they got together in bodies, and fell a robbing others\nafter various manners, and these particularly plundered the places that\nwere about the city, and this because there was no food left either for\nthe horses or the men; yet some of the warlike men, who were used to fight\nregularly, were appointed to defend the city during the siege, and these\ndrove those that raised the banks away from the wall; and these were always\ninventing some engine or another to be a hinderance to the engines of the\nenemy; nor had they so much success any way as in the mines under ground.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "That is, a woman, not, a man."}, "#text": "Now as for the robberies which were committed, the king contrived\nthat ambushes should be so laid, that they might restrain their excursions;\nand as for the want of provisions, he provided that they should be brought\nto them from great distances.

Indeed, though they had so\ngreat an army lying round about them, they bore a siege of five months,\ntill some of Herod's chosen men ventured to get upon the wall, and fell\ninto the city, as did Sosius's centurions after them; and now they first\nof all seized upon what was about the temple; and upon the pouring in of\nthe army, there was slaughter of vast multitudes every where, by reason\nof the rage the Romans were in at the length of this siege, and by reason\nthat the Jews who were about Herod earnestly endeavored that none of their\nadversaries might remain; so they were cut to pieces by great multitudes,\nas they were crowded together in narrow streets, and in houses, or were\nrunning away to the temple; nor was there any mercy showed either to infants,\nor to the aged, or to the weaker sex; insomuch that although the king sent\nabout and desired them to spare the people, nobody could be persuaded to\nwithhold their right hand from slaughter, but they slew people of all ages,\nlike madmen. Then it was that Antigonus, without any regard to his former\nor to his present fortune, came down from the citadel, and fell at Sosius's\nfeet, who without pitying him at all, upon the change of his condition,\nlaughed at him beyond measure, and called him Antigona. \nYet did he not treat him like a woman, or let him go free, but put him\ninto bonds, and kept him in custody."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This death of Antigonus is confirmed by Plutarch and.

He also forbade, at the same\ntime, the spoiling of the city, asking Sosius in the most earnest manner,\nwhether the Romans, by thus emptying the city of money and men, had a mind\nto leave him king of a desert, - and told him that he judged the dominion\nof the habitable earth too small a compensation for the slaughter of so\nmany citizens. And when Sosius said that it was but just to allow the soldiers\nthis plunder as a reward for what they suffered during the siege, Herod\nmade answer, that he would give every one of the soldiers a reward out\nof his own money. So he purchased the deliverance of his country, and performed\nhis promises to them, and made presents after a magnificent manner to each\nsoldier, and proportionably to their commanders, and with a most royal\nbounty to Sosius himself, whereby nobody went away but in a wealthy condition.\nHereupon Sosius dedicated a crown of gold to God, and then went away from\nJerusalem, leading Antigonus away in bonds to Antony; then did the axe\nbring him to his end, \nwho still had a fond desire of life, and some frigid hopes of it to the\nlast, but by his cowardly behavior well deserved to die by it."}, "Hereupon king Herod distinguished the multitude that was in the city;\nand for those that were of his side, he made them still more his friends\nby the honors he conferred on them; but for those of Antigonus's party,\nhe slew them; and as his money ran low, he turned all the ornaments he\nhad into money, and sent it to Antony, and to those about him. Yet could\nhe not hereby purchase an exemption from all sufferings; for Antony was\nnow bewitched by his love to Cleopatra, and was entirely conquered by her\ncharms. Now Cleopatra had put to death all her kindred, till no one near\nher in blood remained alive, and after that she fell a slaying those no\nway related to her. So she calumniated the principal men among the Syrians\nto Antony, and persuaded him to have them slain, that so she might easily\ngain to be mistress of what they had; nay, she extended her avaricious\nhumor to the Jews and Arabians, and secretly labored to have Herod and\nMalichus, the kings of both those nations, slain by his order.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This ancient liberty of Tyre and Sidon under the Romans, taken notice of\nby Josephus, both here and Antiq.

As for myself,\nI am so far from being aftrighted at our enemies after this earthquake,\nthat I imagine that God hath thereby laid a bait for the Arabians, that\nwe may be avenged on them; for their present invasion proceeds more from\nour accidental misfortunes, than that they have any great dependence on\ntheir weapons, or their own fitness for action. Now that hope which depends\nnot on men's own power, but on others' ill success, is a very ticklish\nthing; for there is no certainty among men, either in their bad or good\nfortunes; but we may easily observe that fortune is mutable, and goes from\none side to another; and this you may readily learn from examples among\nyourselves; for when you were once victors in the former fight, your enemies\novercame you at last; and very likely it will now happen so, that these\nwho think themselves sure of beating you will themselves be beaten. For\nwhen men are very confident, they are not upon their guard, while fear\nteaches men to act with caution; insomuch that I venture to prove from\nyour very timorousness that you ought to take courage; for when you were\nmore bold than you ought to have been, and than I would have had you, and\nmarched on, Athenio's treachery took place; but your present slowness and\nseeming dejection of mind is to me a pledge and assurance of victory. And\nindeed it is proper beforehand to be thus provident; but when we come to\naction, we ought to erect our minds, and to make our enemies, be they ever\nso wicked, believe that neither any human, no, nor any providential misfortune,\ncan ever depress the courage of Jews while they are alive; nor will any\nof them ever overlook an Arabian, or suffer such a one to become lord of\nhis good things, whom he has in a manner taken captive, and that many times\nalso. And do not you disturb yourselves at the quaking of inanimate creatures,\nnor do you imagine that this earthquake is a sign of another calamity;\nfor such affections of the elements are according to the course of nature,\nnor does it import any thing further to men, than what mischief it does\nimmediately of itself. Perhaps there may come some short sign beforehand\nin the case of pestilences, and famines, and earthquakes; but these calamities\nthemselves have their force limited by themselves [without foreboding any\nother calamity]. And indeed what greater mischief can the war, though it\nshould be a violent one, do to us than the earthquake hath done? Nay, there\nis a signal of our enemies' destruction visible, and that a very great\none also; and this is not a natural one, nor derived from the hand of foreigners\nneither, but it is this, that they have barbarously murdered our ambassadors,\ncontrary to the common law of mankind; and they have destroyed so many,\nas if they esteemed them sacrifices for God, in relation to this war. But\nthey will not avoid his great eye, nor his invincible right hand; and we\nshall be revenged of them presently, in case we still retain any of the\ncourage of our forefathers, and rise up boldly to punish these covenant-breakers.\nLet every one therefore go on and fight, not so much for his wife or his\nchildren, or for the danger his country is in, as for these ambassadors\nof ours; those dead ambassadors will conduct this war of ours better than\nwe ourselves who are alive.

He then shot at them at a distance, and was desirous to come to an\nengagement presently; for some of them had been sent beforehand to seize\nupon that fortification: but the king sent some who immediately beat them\nout of the fortification, while he himself went in the forefront of the\narmy, which he put in battle-array every day, and invited the Arabians\nto fight. But as none of them came out of their camp, for they were in\na terrible fright, and their general, Elthemus, was not able to say a word\nfor fear, - so Herod came upon them, and pulled their fortification to\npieces, by which means they were compelled to come out to fight, which\nthey did in disorder, and so that the horsemen and foot-men were mixed\ntogether. They were indeed superior to the Jews in number, but inferior\nin their alacrity, although they were obliged to expose themselves to danger\nby their very despair of victory.", "Now while they made opposition, they had not a great number slain;\nbut as soon as they turned their backs, a great many were trodden to pieces\nby the Jews, and a great many by themselves, and so perished, till five\nthousand were fallen down dead in their flight, while the rest of the multitude\nprevented their immediate death, by crowding into the fortification. Herod\nencompassed these around, and besieged them; and while they were ready\nto be taken by their enemies in arms, they had another additional distress\nupon them, which was thirst and want of water; for the king was above hearkening\nto their ambassadors; and when they offered five hundred talents, as the\nprice of their redemption, he pressed still harder upon them. And as they\nwere burnt up by their thirst, they came out and voluntarily delivered\nthemselves up by multitudes to the Jews, till in five days' time four thousand\nof them were put into bonds; and on the sixth day the multitude that were\nleft despaired of saving themselves, and came out to fight: with these\nHerod fought, and slew again about seven thousand, insomuch that he punished\nArabia so severely, and so far extinguished the spirits of the men, that\nhe was chosen by the nation for their ruler.", "BUT now Herod was under immediate concern about a most important\naffair, on account of his friendship with Antony, who was already overcome\nat Actium by Caesar; yet he was more afraid than hurt; for Caesar did not\nthink he had quite undone Antony, while Herod continued his assistance\nto him. However, the king resolved to expose himself to dangers: accordingly\nhe sailed to Rhodes, where Caesar then abode, and came to him without his\ndiadem, and in the habit and appearance of a private person, but in his\nbehavior as a king. So he concealed nothing of the truth, but spike thus\nbefore his face: \"O Caesar, as I was made king of the Jews by Antony,\nso do I profess that I have used my royal authority in the best manner,\nand entirely for his advantage; nor will I conceal this further, that thou\nhadst certainly found me in arms, and an inseparable companion of his,\nhad not the Arabians hindered me. However, I sent him as many auxiliaries\nas I was able, and many ten thousand [cori] of corn. Nay, indeed, I did\nnot desert my benefactor after the bow that was given him at Actium; but\nI gave him the best advice I was able, when I was no longer able to assist\nhim in the war; and I told him that there was but one way of recovering\nhis affairs, and that was to kill Cleopatra; and I promised him that, if\nshe were once dead, I would afford him money and walls for his security,\nwith an army and myself to assist him in his war against thee: but his\naffections for Cleopatra stopped his ears, as did God himself also who\nhath bestowed the government on thee.

However, Antony hath done well\nin preferring Cleopatra to thee; for by this means we have gained thee\nby her madness, and thus thou hast begun to be my friend before I began\nto be thine; on which account Quintus Didius hath written to me that thou\nsentest him assistance against the gladiators.

But Caesar's anger\nagainst him prevailed, and he complained of the many and very great offenses\nthe man whom he petitioned for had been guilty of; and by that means he\nrejected his petition. After this Caesar went for Egypt through Syria,\nwhen Herod received him with royal and rich entertainments; and then did\nhe first of all ride along with Caesar, as he was reviewing his army about\nPtolemais, and feasted him with all his friends, and then distributed among\nthe rest of the army what was necessary to feast them withal. He also made\na plentiful provision of water for them, when they were to march as far\nas Pelusium, through a dry country, which he did also in like manner at\ntheir return thence; nor were there any necessaries wanting to that army.\nIt was therefore the opinion, both of Caesar and of his soldiers, that\nHerod's kingdom was too small for those generous presents he made them;\nfor which reason, when Caesar was come into Egypt, and Cleopatra and Antony\nwere dead, he did not only bestow other marks of honor upon him, but made\nan addition to his kingdom, by giving him not only the country which had\nbeen taken from him by Cleopatra, but besides that, Gadara, and Hippos,\nand Samaria; and moreover, of the maritime cities, Gaza \nand Anthedon, and Joppa, and Strato's Tower.

When Caesar was acquainted with it, he\nsent back orders that this nest of robbers should be destroyed. Varro therefore\nmade an expedition against them, and cleared the land of those men, and\ntook it away from Zenodorus. Caesar did also afterward bestow it on Herod,\nthat it might not again become a receptacle for those robbers that had\ncome against Damascus. He also made him a procurator of all Syria, and\nthis on the tenth year afterward, when he came again into that province;\nand this was so established, that the other procurators could not do any\nthing in the administration without his advice: but when Zenodorus was\ndead, Caesar bestowed on him all that land which lay between Trachonitis\nand Galilee.

Now this Hyrcanus had been\ncarried captive to Barzapharnes, when he overran Syria; but those of his\nown country beyond Euphrates were desirous he would stay with them, and\nthis out of the commiseration they had for his condition; and had he complied\nwith their desires, when they exhorted him not to go over the river to\nlierod, he had not perished: but the marriage of his granddaughter [to\nHerod] was his temptation; for as he relied upon him, and was over-fond\nof his own country, he came back to it. Herod's provocation was this, -\nnot that Hyrcanus made any attempt to gain the kingdom, but that it was\nfitter for him to be their king than for Herod.", "Now of the five children which Herod had by Mariamne, two of them\nwere daughters, and three were sons; and the youngest of these sons was\neducated at Rome, and there died; but the two eldest he treated as those\nof royal blood, on account of the nobility of their mother, and because\nthey were not born till he was king. But then what was stronger than all\nthis was the love that he bare to Mariamne, and which inflamed him every\nday to a great degree, and so far conspired with the other motives, that\nhe felt no other troubles, on account of her he loved so entirely. But\nMariamne's hatred to him was not inferior to his love to her. She had indeed\nbut too just a cause of indignation from what he had done, while her boldness\nproceeded from his affection to her; so she openly reproached him with\nwhat he had done to her grandfather Hyrcanus, and to her brother Aristobulus;\nfor he had not spared this Aristobulus, though he were but a child; for\nwhen he had given him the high priesthood at the age of seventeen, he slew\nhim quickly after he had conferred that dignity upon him; but when Aristobulus\nhad put on the holy vestments, and had approached to the altar at a festival,\nthe multitude, in great crowds, fell into tears; whereupon the child was\nsent by night to Jericho, and was there dipped by the Galls, at Herod's\ncommand, in a pool till he was drowned.", "For these reasons Mariamne reproached Herod, and his sister and mother,\nafter a most contumelious manner, while he was dumb on account of his affection\nfor her; yet had the women great indignation at her, and raised a calumny\nagainst her, that she was false to his bed; which thing they thought most\nlikely to move Herod to anger. They also contrived to have many other circumstances\nbelieved, in order to make the thing more credible, and accused her of\nhaving sent her picture into Egypt to Antony, and that her lust was so\nextravagant, as to have thus showed herself, though she was absent, to\na man that ran mad after women, and to a man that had it in his power to\nuse violence to her. This charge fell like a thunderbolt upon Herod, and\nput him into disorder; and that especially, because his love to her occasioned\nhim to be jealous, and because he considered with himself that Cleopatra\nwas a shrewd woman, and that on her account Lysanias the king was taken\noff, as well as Malichus the Arabian; for his fear did not only extend\nto the dissolving of his marriage, but to the danger of his life.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Here is either a defect or a great mistake in Josephus's present copies\nor memory; for Mariamne did not now reproach Herod with this his first\ninjunction to Joseph to kill her, if he himself were slain by Antony, but\nthat he had given the like command a second time to Soemus also, when he\nwas afraid of being slain by Augustus.

But Joseph, without any ill design, and only in order to demonstrate\nthe king's love to his wife, how he could not bear to think of being separated\nfrom her, even by death itself, discovered this grand secret to her; upon\nwhich, when Herod was come back, and as they talked together, and he confirmed\nhis love to her by many oaths, and assured her that he had never such an\naffection for any other woman as he had for her, - \" Yes,\" says\nshe, \"thou didst, to be sure, demonstrate thy love to me by the injunctions\nthou gavest Joseph, when thou commandedst him to kill me.\""}, "When he heard that this grand secret was discovered, he was like\na distracted man, and said that Joseph would never have disclosed that\ninjunction of his, unless he had debauched her. His passion also made him\nstark mad, and leaping out of his bed, he ran about the palace after a\nwild manner; at which time his sister Salome took the opportunity also\nto blast her reputation, and confirmed his suspicion about Joseph; whereupon,\nout of his ungovernable jealousy and rage, he commanded both of them to\nbe slain immediately; but as soon as ever his passion was over, he repented\nof what he had done, and as soon as his anger was worn off, his affections\nwere kindled again. And indeed the flame of his desires for her was so\nardent, that he could not think she was dead, but would appear, under his\ndisorders, to speak to her as if she were still alive, till he were better\ninstructed by time, when his grief and trouble, now she was dead, appeared\nas great as his affection had been for her while she was living.", "NOW Mariamne's sons were heirs to that hatred which had been borne\ntheir mother; and when they considered the greatness of Herod's crime towards\nher, they were suspicious of him as of an enemy of theirs; and this first\nwhile they were educated at Rome, but still more when they were returned\nto Judea. This temper of theirs increased upon them as they grew up to\nbe men; and when they were Come to an age fit for marriage, the one of\nthem married their aunt Salome's daughter, which Salome had been the accuser\nof their mother; the other married the daughter of Archclaus, king of Cappadocia.\nAnd now they used boldness in speaking, as well as bore hatred in their\nminds. Now those that calumniated them took a handle from such their boldness,\nand certain of them spake now more plainly to the king that there were\ntreacherous designs laid against him by both his sons; and he that was\nson-in-law to Archelaus, relying upon his father-in-law, was preparing\nto fly away, in order to accuse Herod before Caesar; and when Herod's head\nhad been long enough filled with these calumnies, he brought Antipater,\nwhom he had by Doris, into favor again, as a defense to him against his\nother sons, and began all the ways he possibly could to prefer him before\nthem.", "But these sons were not able to bear this change in their affairs;\nbut when they saw him that was born of a mother of no family, the nobility\nof their birth made them unable to contain their indignation; but whensoever\nthey were uneasy, they showed the anger they had at it. And as these sons\ndid day after day improve in that their anger, Antipater already exercised\nall his own abilities, which were very great, in flattering his father,\nand in contriving many sorts of calumnies against his brethren, while he\ntold some stories of them himself, and put it upon other proper persons\nto raise other stories against them, till at length he entirely cut his\nbrethren off from all hopes of succeeding to the kingdom; for he was already\npublicly put into his father's will as his successor. Accordingly, he was\nsent with royal ornaments, and other marks of royalty, to Caesar, excepting\nthe diadem. He was also able in time to introduce his mother again into\nMariamne's bed. The two sorts of weapons he made use of against his brethren\nwere flattery and calumny, whereby he brought matters privately to such\na pass, that the king had thoughts of putting his sons to death.", "So the father drew Alexander as far as Rome, and. charged him with\nan attempt of poisoning him before Caesar. Alexander could hardly speak\nfor lamentation; but having a judge that was more skillful than Antipater,\nand more wise than Herod, he modestly avoided laying any imputation upon\nhis father, but with great strength of reason confuted the calumnies laid\nagainst him; and when he had demonstrated the innocency of his brother,\nwho was in the like danger with himself, he at last bewailed the craftiness\nof Antipater, and the disgrace they were under. He was enabled also to\njustify himself, not only by a clear conscience, which he carried within\nhim, but by his eloquence; for he was a shrewd man in making speeches.\nAnd upon his saying at last, that if his father objected this crime to\nthem, it was in his power to put them to death, he made all the audience\nweep; and he brought Caesar to that pass, as to reject the accusations,\nand to reconcile their father to them immediately. But the conditions of\nthis reconciliation were these, that they should in all things be obedient\nto their father, and that he should have power to leave the kingdom to\nwhich of them he pleased.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "That this island Eleusa, afterward called Sebaste, near Cilicia, had in\nit the royal palace of this Archclaus, king of Cappadocia, Strabo testifies,\nB.

But as Herod sailed by Cilicia,\nhe touched at Eleusa, \nwhere Archclaus treated them in the most obliging manner, and gave him\nthanks for the deliverance of his son-in-law, and was much pleased at their\nreconciliation; and this the more, because he had formerly written to his\nfriends at Rome that they should be assisting to Alexander at his trial.\nSo he conducted Herod as far as Zephyrium, and made him presents to the\nvalue of thirty talents."}, "Now when Herod was come to Jerusalem, he gathered the people together,\nand presented to them his three sons, and gave them an apologetic account\nof his absence, and thanked God greatly, and thanked Caesar greatly also,\nfor settling his house when it was under disturbances, and had procured\nconcord among his sons, which was of greater consequence than the kingdom\nitself, -\" and which I will render still more firm; for Caesar hath\nput into my power to dispose of the government, and to appoint my successor.\nAccordingly, in way of requital for his kindness, and in order to provide\nfor mine own advantage, I do declare that these three sons of mine shall\nbe kings. And, in the first place, I pray for the approbation of God to\nwhat I am about; and, in the next place, I desire your approbation also.\nThe age of one of them, and the nobility of the other two, shall procure\nthem the succession. Nay, indeed, my kingdom is so large that it may be\nsufficient for more kings. Now do you keep those in their places whom Caesar\nhath joined, and their father hath appointed; and do not you pay undue\nor unequal respects to them, but to every one according to the prerogative\nof their births; for he that pays such respects unduly, will thereby not\nmake him that is honored beyond what his age requires so joyful, as he\nwill make him that is dishonored sorrowful. As for the kindred and friends\nthat are to converse with them, I will appoint them to each of them, and\nwill so constitute them, that they may be securities for their concord;\nas well knowing that the ill tempers of those with whom they converse will\nproduce quarrels and contentions among them; but that if these with whom\nthey converse be of good tempers, they will preserve their natural affections\nfor one another. But still I desire that not these only, but all the captains\nof my army, have for the present their hopes placed on me alone; for I\ndo not give away my kingdom to these my sons, but give them royal honors\nonly; whereby it will come to pass that they will enjoy the sweet parts\nof government as rulers themselves, but that the burden of administration\nwill rest upon myself whether I will or not. And let every one consider\nwhat age I am of, how I have conducted my life, and what piety I have exercised;\nfor my age is not so great that men may soon expect the end of my life;\nnor have I indulged such a luxurious way of living as cuts men off when\nthey are young; and we have been so religious towards God, that we [have\nreason to hope we] may arrive at a very great age. But for such as cultivate\na friendship with my sons, so as to aim at my destruction, they shall be\npunished by me on their account. I am not one who envy my own children,\nand therefore forbid men to pay them great respect; but I know that such\n[extravagant] respects are the way to make them insolent. And if every\none that comes near them does but revolve this in his mind, that if he\nprove a good man, he shall receive a reward from me, but that if he prove\nseditious, his ill-intended complaisance shall get him nothing from him\nto whom it is shown, I suppose they will all be of my side, that is, of\nmy sons' side; for it will be for their advantage that I reign, and that\nI be at concord with them. But do you, O my good children, reflect upon\nthe holiness of nature itself, by whose means natural affection is preserved,\neven among wild beasts; in the next place, reflect upon Caesar, who hath\nmade this reconciliation among us; and in the third place, reflect upon\nme, who entreat you to do what I have power to command you, - continue\nbrethren. I give you royal garments, and royal honors; and I pray to God\nto preserve what I have determined, in case you be at concord one with\nanother.\" When the king had thus spoken, and had saluted every one\nof his sons after an obliging manner, he dismissed the multitude; some\nof which gave their assent to what he had said, and wished it might take\neffect accordingly; but for those who wished for a change of affairs, they\npretended they did not so much as hear what he said.", "BUT now the quarrel that was between them still accompanied these\nbrethren when they parted, and the suspicions they had one of the other\ngrew worse. Alexander and Aristobulus were much grieved that the privilege\nof the first-born was confirmed to Antipater; as was Antipater very angry\nat his brethren that they were to succeed him. But then this last being\nof a disposition that was mutable and politic, he knew how to hold his\ntongue, and used a great deal of cunning, and thereby concealed the hatred\nhe bore to them; while the former, depending on the nobility of their births,\nhad every thing upon their tongues which was in their minds. Many also\nthere were who provoked them further, and many of their [seeming] friends\ninsinuated themselves into their acquaintance, to spy out what they did.\nNow every thing that was said by Alexander was presently brought to Antipater,\nand from Antipater it was brought to Herod with additions. Nor could the\nyoung man say any thing in the simplicity of his heart, without giving\noffense, but what he said was still turned to calumny against him. And\nif he had been at any time a little free in his conversation, great imputations\nwere forged from the smallest occasions. Antipater also was perpetually\nsetting some to provoke him to speak, that the lies he raised of him might\nseem to have some foundation of truth; and if, among the many stories that\nwere given out, but one of them could be proved true, that was supposed\nto imply the rest to be true also. And as to Antipater's friends, they\nwere all either naturally so cautious in speaking, or had been so far bribed\nto conceal their thoughts, that nothing of these grand secrets got abroad\nby their means. Nor should one be mistaken if he called the life of Antipater\na mystery of wickedness; for he either corrupted Alexander's acquaintance\nwith money, or got into their favor by flatteries; by which two means he\ngained all his designs, and brought them to betray their master, and to\nsteal away, and reveal what he either did or said. Thus did he act a part\nvery cunningly in all points, and wrought himself a passage by his calumnies\nwith the greatest shrewdness; while he put on a face as if he were a kind\nbrother to Alexander and Aristobulus, but suborned other men to inform\nof what they did to Herod. And when any thing was told against Alexander,\nhe would come in, and pretend [to be of his side], and would begin to contradict\nwhat was said; but would afterward contrive matters so privately, that\nthe king should have an indignation at him. His general aim was this, -\nto lay a plot, and to make it believed that Alexander lay in wait to kill\nhis father; for nothing afforded so great a confirmation to these calumnies\nas did Antipater's apologies for him.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "That it was an immemorial custom among the Jews, and their forefathers,\nthe patriarchs, to have sometimes more wives or wives and concubines, than\none at the same the and that this polygamy was not directly forbidden in\nthe law of Moses is evident; but that polygamy was ever properly and distinctly\npermitted in that law of Moses, in the places here cited by Dean Aldrich,\nDeuteronomy 17:16, 17, or 21:15, or indeed any where else, does not appear\nto me. And what our Savior says about the common Jewish divorces, which\nmay lay much greater claim to such a permission than polygamy, seems to\nme true in this case also; that Moses, \"for the hardness of their\nhearts,\" suffered them to have several wives at the same time, but\nthat \"from the beginning it was not so,\" Matthew 19:8; Mark 10:5."}, "#text": "By these methods Herod was inflamed, and as much as his natural affection\nto the young men did every day diminish, so much did it increase towards\nAntipater. The courtiers also inclined to the same conduct, some of their\nown accord, and others by the king's injunction, as particularly did Ptolemy,\nthe king's dearest friend, as also the king's brethren, and all his children;\nfor Antipater was all in all; and what was the bitterest part of all to\nAlexander, Antipater's mother was also all in all; she was one that gave\ncounsel against them, and was more harsh than a step-mother, and one that\nhated the queen's sons more than is usual to hate sons-in-law. All men\ndid therefore already pay their respects to Antipater, in hopes of advantage;\nand it was the king's command which alienated every body [from the brethren],\nhe having given this charge to his most intimate friends, that they should\nnot come near, nor pay any regard, to Alexander, or to his friends. Herod\nwas also become terrible, not only to his domestics about the court, but\nto his friends abroad; for Caesar had given such a privilege to no other\nking as he had given to him, which was this, - that he might fetch back\nany one that fled from him, even out of a city that was not under his own\njurisdiction. Now the young men were not acquainted with the calumnies\nraised against them; for which reason they could not guard themselves against\nthem, but fell under them; for their father did not make any public complaints\nagainst either of them; though in a little time they perceived how things\nwere by his coldness to them, and by the great uneasiness he showed upon\nany thing that troubled him. Antipater had also made their uncle Pheroras\nto be their enemy, as well as their aunt Salome, while he was always talking\nwith her, as with a wife, and irritating her against them. Moreover, Alexander's\nwife, Glaphyra, augmented this hatred against them, by deriving her nobility\nand genealogy [from great persons], and pretending that she was a lady\nsuperior to all others in that kingdom, as being derived by her father's\nside from Temenus, and by her mother's side from Darius, the son of Hystaspes.\nShe also frequently reproached Herod's sister and wives with the ignobility\nof their descent; and that they were every one chosen by him for their\nbeauty, but not for their family. Now those wives of his were not a few;\nit being of old permitted to the Jews to marry many wives, \nand this king delighting in many; all which hated Alexander, on account\nof Glaphyra's boasting and reproaches."}, "Nay, Aristobulus had raised a quarrel between himself and Salome,\nwho was his mother-in-law, besides the anger he had conceived at Glaphyra's\nreproaches; for he perpetually upbraided his wife with the meanness of\nher family, and complained, that as he had married a woman of a low family,\nso had his brother Alexander married one of royal blood. At this Salome's\ndaughter wept, and told it her with this addition, that Alexander threatened\nthe mothers of his other brethren, that when he should come to the crown,\nhe would make them weave with their maidens, and would make those brothers\nof his country schoolmasters; and brake this jest upon them, that they\nhad been very carefully instructed, to fit them for such an employment.\nHereupon Salome could not contain her anger, but told all to Herod; nor\ncould her testimony be suspected, since it was against her own son-in-law\nThere was also another calumny that ran abroad and inflamed the king's\nmind; for he heard that these sons of his were perpetually speaking of\ntheir mother, and, among their lamentations for her, did not abstain from\ncursing him; and that when he made presents of any of Mariamne's garments\nto his later wives, these threatened that in a little time, instead of\nroyal garments, they would clothe theft in no better than hair-cloth.", "Now upon these accounts, though Herod was somewhat afraid of the\nyoung men's high spirit, yet did he not despair of reducing them to a better\nmind; but before he went to Rome, whither he was now going by sea, he called\nthem to him, and partly threatened them a little, as a king; but for the\nmain, he admonished them as a father, and exhorted them to love their brethren,\nand told them that he would pardon their former offenses, if they would\namend for the time to come. But they refuted the calumnies that had been\nraised of them, and said they were false, and alleged that their actions\nwere sufficient for their vindication; and said withal, that he himself\nought to shut his ears against such tales, and not be too easy in believing\nthem, for that there would never be wanting those that would tell lies\nto their disadvantage, as long as any would give ear to them.", "When they had thus soon pacified him, as being their father, they\ngot clear of the present fear they were in. Yet did they see occasion for\nsorrow in some time afterward; for they knew that Salome, as well as their\nuncle Pheroras, were their enemies; who were both of them heavy and severe\npersons, and especially Pheroras, who was a partner with Herod in all the\naffairs of the kingdom, excepting his diadem. He had also a hundred talents\nof his own revenue, and enjoyed the advantage of all the land beyond Jordan,\nwhich he had received as a gift from his brother, who had asked of Caesar\nto make him a tetrarch, as he was made accordingly. Herod had also given\nhim a wife out of the royal family, who was no other than his own wife's\nsister, and after her death had solemnly espoused to him his own eldest\ndaughter, with a dowry of three hundred talents; but Pheroras refused to\nconsummate this royal marriage, out of his affection to a maidservant of\nhis. Upon which account Herod was very angry, and gave that daughter in\nmarriage to a brother's son of his, [Joseph,] who was slain afterward by\nthe Parthians; but in some time he laid aside his anger against Pheroras,\nand pardoned him, as one not able to overcome his foolish passion for the\nmaid-servant.", "Nay, Pheroras had been accused long before, while the queen [Mariamne]\nwas alive, as if he were in a plot to poison Herod; and there came then\nso great a number of informers, that Herod himself, though he was an exceeding\nlover of his brethren, was brought to believe what was said, and to be\nafraid of it also. And when he had brought many of those that were under\nsuspicion to the torture, he came at last to Pheroras's own friends; none\nof which did openly confess the crime, but they owned that he had made\npreparation to take her whom he loved, and run away to the Parthians. Costobarus\nalso, the husband of Salome, to whom the king had given her in marriage,\nafter her former husband had been put to death for adultery, was instrumental\nin bringing about this contrivance and flight of his. Nor did Salome escape\nall calumny upon herself; for her brother Pheroras accused her that she\nhad made an agreement to marry Silleus, the procurator of Obodas, king\nof Arabia, who was at bitter enmity with Herod; but when she was convicted\nof this, and of all that Pheroras had accused her of, she obtained her\npardon. The king also pardoned Pheroras himself the crimes he had been\naccused of.", "But the storm of the whole family was removed to Alexander, and all\nof it rested upon his head. There were three eunuchs who were in the highest\nesteem with the king, as was plain by the offices they were in about him;\nfor one of them was appointed to be his butler, another of them got his\nsupper ready for him, and the third put him into bed, and lay down by him.\nNow Alexander had prevailed with these men, by large gifts, to let him\nuse them after an obscene manner; which, when it was told to the king,\nthey were tortured, and found guilty, and presently confessed the criminal\nconversation he had with them. They also discovered the promises by which\nthey were induced so to do, and how they were deluded by Alexander, who\nhad told them that they ought not to fix their hopes upon Herod, an old\nman, and one so shameless as to color his hair, unless they thought that\nwould make him young again; but that they ought to fix their attention\nto him who was to be his successor in the kingdom, whether he would or\nnot; and who in no long time would avenge himself on his enemies, and make\nhis friends happy and blessed, and themselves in the first place; that\nthe men of power did already pay respects to Alexander privately, and that\nthe captains of the soldiery, and the officers, did secretly come to him.", "These confessions did so terrify Herod, that he durst not immediately\npublish them; but he sent spies abroad privately, by night and by day,\nwho should make a close inquiry after all that was done and said; and when\nany were but suspected [of treason], he put them to death, insomuch that\nthe palace was full of horribly unjust proceedings; for every body forged\ncalumnies, as they were themselves in a state of enmity or hatred against\nothers; and many there were who abused the king's bloody passion to the\ndisadvantage of those with whom they had quarrels, and lies were easily\nbelieved, and punishments were inflicted sooner than the calumnies were\nforged. He who had just then been accusing another was accused himself,\nand was led away to execution together with him whom he had convicted;\nfor the danger the king was in of his life made examinations be very short.\nHe also proceeded to such a degree of bitterness, that he could not look\non any of those that were not accused with a pleasant countenance, but\nwas in the most barbarous disposition towards his own friends. Accordingly,\nhe forbade a great many of them to come to court, and to those whom he\nhad not power to punish actually he spake harshly. But for Antipater, he\ninsulted Alexander, now he was under his misfortunes, and got a stout company\nof his kindred together, and raised all sorts of calumny against him; and\nfor the king, he was brought to such a degree of terror by those prodigious\nslanders and contrivances, that he fancied he saw Alexander coming to him\nwith a drawn sword in his hand. So he caused him to be seized upon immediately,\nand bound, and fell to examining his friends by torture, many of whom died\n[under the torture], but would discover nothing, nor say any thing against\ntheir consciences; but some of them, being forced to speak falsely by the\npains they endured, said that Alexander, and his brother Aristobulus, plotted\nagainst him, and waited for an opportunity to kill him as he was hunting,\nand then fly away to Rome. These accusations though they were of an incredible\nnature, and only framed upon the great distress they were in, were readily\nbelieved by the king, who thought it some comfort to him, after he had\nbound his son, that it might appear he had not done it unjustly.", "NOW as to Alexander, since he perceived it impossible to persuade\nhis father [that he was innocent], he resolved to meet his calamities,\nhow severe soever they were; so he composed four books against his enemies,\nand confessed that he had been in a plot; but declared withal that the\ngreatest part [of the courtiers] were in a plot with him, and chiefly Pheroras\nand Salome; nay, that Salome once came and forced him to lie with her in\nthe night time, whether he would or no. These books were put into Herod's\nhands, and made a great clamor against the men in power. And now it was\nthat Archelaus came hastily into Judea, as being affrighted for his son-in-law\nand his daughter; and he came as a proper assistant, and in a very prudent\nmanner, and by a stratagem he obliged the king not to execute what he had\nthreatened; for when he was come to him, he cried out, \"Where in the\nworld is this wretched son-in-law of mine? Where shall I see the head of\nhim which contrived to murder his father, which I will tear to pieces with\nmy own hands? I will do the same also to my daughter, who hath such a fine\nhusband; for although she be not a partner in the plot, yet, by being the\nwife of such a creature, she is polluted. And I cannot but admire at thy\npatience, against whom this plot is laid, if Alexander be still alive;\nfor as I came with what haste I could from Cappadocia, I expected to find\nhim put to death for his crimes long ago; but still, in order to make an\nexamination with thee about my daughter, whom, out of regard to thee and\nby dignity, I had espoused to him in marriage; but now we must take counsel\nabout them both; and if thy paternal affection be so great, that thou canst\nnot punish thy son, who hath plotted against thee, let us change our right\nhands, and let us succeed one to the other in expressing our rage upon\nthis occasion.\"", "When he had made this pompous declaration, he got Herod to remit\nof his anger, though he were in disorder, who thereupon gave him the books\nwhich Alexander had composed to be read by him; and as he came to every\nhead, he considered of it, together with Herod. So Archclaus took hence\nthe occasion for that stratagem which he made use of, and by degrees he\nlaid the blame on those men whose names were in these books, and especially\nupon Pheroras; and when he saw that the king believed him [to he in earnest],\nhe said, \"We must consider whether the young man be not himself plotted\nagainst by such a number of wicked wretches, and not thou plotted against\nby the young man; for I cannot see any occasion for his falling into so\nhorrid a crime, since he enjoys the advantages of royalty already, and\nhas the expectation of being one of thy successors; I mean this, unless\nthere were some persons that persuade him to it, and such persons as make\nan ill use of the facility they know there is to persuade young men; for\nby such persons, not only young men are sometimes imposed upon, but old\nmen also, and by them sometimes are the most illustrious families and kingdoms\noverturned.\"", "Herod assented to what he had said, and, by degrees, abated of his\nanger against Alexander, but was more angry at Pheroras; for the principal\nsubject of the four books was Pheroras; who perceiving that the king's\ninclinations changed on a sudden, and that Archelaus's friendship could\ndo every thing with him, and that he had no honorable method of preserving\nhimself, he procured his safety by his impudence. So he left Alexander,\nand had recourse to Archelaus, who told him that he did not see how he\ncould get him excused, now he was directly caught in so many crimes, whereby\nit was evidently demonstrated that he had plotted against the king, and\nhad been the cause of those misfortunes which the young man was now under,\nunless he would moreover leave off his cunning knavery, and his denials\nof what he was charged withal, and confess the charge, and implore pardon\nof his brother, who still had a kindness for him; but that if he would\ndo so, he would afford him all the assistance he was able.", "With this advice Pheroras complied, and putting himself into such\na habit as might most move compassion, he came with black cloth upon his\nbody, and tears in his eyes, and threw himself down at Herod's feet, and\nbegged his pardon for what he had done, and confessed that he had acted\nvery wickedly, and was guilty of every thing that he had been accused of,\nand lamented that disorder of his mind, and distraction which his love\nto a woman, he said, had brought him to. So when Archelaus had brought\nPheroras to accuse and bear witness against himself, he then made an excuse\nfor him, and mitigated Herod's anger towards him, and this by using certain\ndomestical examples; for that when he had suffered much greater mischiefs\nfrom a brother of his own, he prefered the obligations of nature before\nthe passion of revenge; because it is in kingdoms as it is in gross bodies,\nwhere some member or other is ever swelled by the body's weight, in which\ncase it is not proper to cut off such member, but to heal it by a gentle\nmethod of cure.", "Upon Arehelaus's saying this, and much more to the same purpose,\nHerod's displeasure against Pheroras was mollified; yet did he persevere\nin his own indignation against Alexander, and said he would have his daughter\ndivorced, and taken away from him, and this till he had brought Herod to\nthat pass, that, contrary to his former behavior to him, he petitioned\nArchelaus for the young man, and that he would let his daughter continue\nespoused to him: but Archelaus made him strongly believe that he would\npermit her to be married to any one else, but not to Alexander, because\nhe looked upon it as a very valuable advantage, that the relation they\nhad contracted by that affinity, and the privileges that went along with\nit, might be preserved. And when the king said that his son would take\nit for a great favor to him, if he would not dissolve that marriage, especially\nsince they had already children between the young man and her, and since\nthat wife of his was so well beloved by him, and that as while she remains\nhis wife she would be a great preservative to him, and keep him from offending,\nas he had formerly done; so if she should be once torn away from him, she\nwould be the cause of his falling into despair, because such young men's\nattempts are best mollified when they are diverted from them by settling\ntheir affections at home. So Arehelaus complied with what Herod desired,\nbut not without difficulty, and was both himself reconciled to the young\nman, and reconciled his father to him also. However, he said he must, by\nall means, be sent to Rome to discourse with Caesar, because he had already\nwritten a full account to him of this whole matter.", "Thus a period was put to Archelaus's stratagem, whereby he delivered\nhis son-in-law out of the dangers he was in; but when these reconciliations\nwere over, they spent their time in feastings and agreeable entertainments.\nAnd when Archelaus was going away, Herod made him a present of seventy\ntalents, with a golden throne set with precious stones, and some eunuchs,\nand a concubine who was called Pannychis. He also paid due honors to every\none of his friends according to their dignity. In like manner did all the\nking's kindred, by his command, make glorious presents to Archelaus; and\nso he was conducted on his way by Herod and his nobility as far as Antioch.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "See the preceding note."}, "#text": "NOW a little afterward there came into Judea a man that was much\nsuperior to Arehelaus's stratagems, who did not only overturn that reconciliation\nthat had been so wisely made with Alexander, but proved the occasion of\nhis ruin. He was a Lacedemonian, and his name was Eurycles. He was so corrupt\na man, that out of the desire of getting money, he chose to live under\na king, for Greece could not suffice his luxury. He presented Herod with\nsplendid gifts, as a bait which he laid in order to compass his ends, and\nquickly received them back again manifold; yet did he esteem bare gifts\nas nothing, unless he imbrued the kingdom in blood by his purchases. Accordingly,\nhe imposed upon the king by flattering him, and by talking subtlely to\nhim, as also by the lying encomiums which he made upon him; for as he soon\nperceived Herod's blind side, so he said and did every thing that might\nplease him, and thereby became one of his most intimate friends; for both\nthe king and all that were about him had a great regard for this Spartan,\non account of his country."}, "Now as soon as this fellow perceived the rotten parts of the family,\nand what quarrels the brothers had one with another, and in what disposition\nthe father was towards each of them, he chose to take his lodging at the\nfirst in the house of Antipater, but deluded Alexander with a pretense\nof friendship to him, and falsely claimed to be an old acquaintance of\nArchelaus; for which reason he was presently admitted into Alexander's\nfamiliarity as a faithful friend. He also soon recommended himself to his\nbrother Aristobulus. And when he had thus made trial of these several persons,\nhe imposed upon one of them by one method, and upon another by another.\nBut he was principally hired by Antipater, and so betrayed Alexander, and\nthis by reproaching Antipater, because, while he was the eldest son he\noverlooked the intrigues of those who stood in the way of his expectations;\nand by reproaching Alexander, because he who was born of a queen, and was\nmarried to a king's daughter, permitted one that was born of a mean woman\nto lay claim to the succession, and this when he had Archelaus to support\nhim in the most complete manner. Nor was his advice thought to be other\nthan faithful by the young man, because of his pretended friendship with\nArchelaus; on which account it was that Alexander lamented to him Antipater's\nbehavior with regard to himself, and this without concealing any thing\nfrom him; and how it was no wonder if Herod, after he had killed their\nmother, should deprive them of her kingdom. Upon this Eurycles pretended\nto commiserate his condition, and to grieve with him. He also, by a bait\nthat he laid for him, procured Aristobulus to say the same things. Thus\ndid he inveigle both the brothers to make complaints of their father, and\nthen went to Antipater, and carried these grand secrets to him. He also\nadded a fiction of his own, as if his brothers had laid a plot against\nhim, and were almost ready to come upon him with their drawn swords. For\nthis intelligence he received a great sum of money, and on that account\nhe commended Antipater before his father, and at length undertook the work\nof bringing Alexander and Aristobulus to their graves, and accused them\nbefore their father. So he came to Herod, and told him that he would save\nhis life, as a requital for the favors he had received from him, and would\npreserve his light [of life] by way of retribution for his kind entertainment;\nfor that a sword had been long whetted, and Alexander's right hand had\nbeen long stretched out against him; but that he had laid impediments in\nhis way, prevented his speed, and that by pretending to assist him in his\ndesign: how Alexander said that Herod was not contented to reign in a kingdom\nthat belonged to others, and to make dilapidations in their mother's government\nafter he had killed her; but besides all this, that he introduced a spurious\nsuccessor, and proposed to give the kingdom of their ancestors to that\npestilent fellow Antipater: - that he would now appease the ghosts of Hyrcanus\nand Mariamne, by taking vengeance on him; for that it was not fit for him\nto take the succession to the government from such a father without bloodshed:\nthat many things happen every day to provoke him so to do, insomuch that\nhe can say nothing at all, but it affords occasion for calumny against\nhim; for that if any mention be made of nobility of birth, even in other\ncases, he is abused unjustly, while his father would say that nobody, to\nbe sure, is of noble birth but Alexander, and that his father was inglorious\nfor want of such nobility. If they be at any time hunting, and he says\nnothing, he gives offense; and if he commends any body, they take it in\nway of jest. That they always find their father unmercifully severe, and\nhave no natural affection for any of them but for Antipater; on which accounts,\nif this plot does not take, he is very willing to die; but that in case\nhe kill his father, he hath sufficient opportunities for saving himself.\nIn the first place, he hath Archelaus his father-in-law to whom he can\neasily fly; and in the next place, he hath Caesar, who had never known\nHerod's character to this day; for that he shall not appear then before\nhim with that dread he used to do when his father was there to terrify\nhim; and that he will not then produce the accusations that concerned himself\nalone, but would, in the first place, openly insist on the calamities of\ntheir nation, and how they are taxed to death, and in what ways of luxury\nand wicked practices that wealth is spent which was gotten by bloodshed;\nwhat sort of persons they are that get our riches, and to whom those cities\nbelong upon whom he bestows his favors; that he would have inquiry made\nwhat became of his grandfather [Hyrcanus], and his mother [Mariamne], and\nwould openly proclaim the gross wickedness that was in the kingdom; on\nwhich accounts he should not be deemed a parricide.", "When Eurycles had made this portentous speech, he greatly commended\nAntipater, as the only child that had an affection for his father, and\non that account was an impediment to the other's plot against him. Hereupon\nthe king, who had hardly repressed his anger upon the former accusations,\nwas exasperated to an incurable degree. At which time Antipater took another\noccasion to send in other persons to his father to accuse his brethren,\nand to tell him that they had privately discoursed with Jucundus and Tyrannus,\nwho had once been masters of the horse to the king, but for some offenses\nhad been put out of that honorable employment. Herod was in a very great\nrage at these informations, and presently ordered those men to be tortured;\nyet did not they confess any thing of what the king had been informed;\nbut a certain letter was produced, as written by Alexander to the governor\nof a castle, to desire him to receive him and Aristobulus into the castle\nwhen he had killed his father, and to give them weapons, and what other\nassistance he could, upon that occasion. Alexander said that this letter\nwas a forgery of Diophantus. This Diophantus was the king's secretary,\na bold man, and cunning in counterfeiting any one's hand; and after he\nhad counterfeited a great number, he was at last put to death for it. Herod\ndid also order the governor of the castle to be tortured, but got nothing\nout of him of what the accusations suggested.", "However, although Herod found the proofs too weak, he gave order\nto have his sons kept in custody; for till now they had been at liberty.\nHe also called that pest of his family, and forger of all this vile accusation,\nEurycles, his savior and benefactor, and gave him a reward of fifty talents.\nUpon which he prevented any accurate accounts that could come of what he\nhad done, by going immediately into Cappadocia, and there he got money\nof Archelaus, having the impudence to pretend that he had reconciled Herod\nto Alexander. He thence passed over into Greece, and used what he had thus\nwickedly gotten to the like wicked purposes. Accordingly, he was twice\naccused before Caesar, that he had filled Achaia with sedition, and had\nplundered its cities; and so he was sent into banishment. And thus was\nhe punished for what wicked actions he had been guilty of about Aristobulus\nand Alexander.", "But it will now be worth while to put Euaratus of Cos in opposition\nto this Spartan; for as he was one of Alexander's most intimate friends,\nand came to him in his travels at the same time that Eurycles came; so\nthe king put the question to him, whether those things of which Alexander\nwas accused were true? He assured him upon oath that he had never heard\nany such things from the young men; yet did this testimony avail nothing\nfor the clearing those miserable creatures; for Herod was only disposed\nand most ready to hearken to what made against them, and every one was\nmost agreeable to him that would believe they were guilty, and showed their\nindignation at them.", "MOREOVER, Salome exasperated Herod's cruelty against his sons; for\nAristobulus was desirous to bring her, who was his mother-in-law and his\naunt, into the like dangers with themselves; so he sent to her to take\ncare of her own safety, and told her that the king was preparing to put\nher to death, on account of the accusation that was laid against her, as\nif when she formerly endeavored to marry herself to Sylleus the Arabian,\nshe had discovered the king's grand secrets to him, who was the king's\nenemy; and this it was that came as the last storm, and entirely sunk the\nyoung men when they were in great danger before. For Salome came running\nto the king, and informed him of what admonition had been given her; whereupon\nhe could bear no longer, but commanded both the young men to be bound,\nand kept the one asunder from the other. He also sent Volumnius, the general\nof his army, to Caesar immediately, as also his friend Olympus with him,\nwho carried the informations in writing along with them. Now as soon as\nthey had sailed to Rome, and delivered the king's letters to Caesar, Caesar\nwas mightily troubled at the case of the young men; yet did not he think\nhe ought to take the power from the father of condemning his sons; so he\nwrote back to him, and appointed him to have the power over his sons; but\nsaid withal, that he would do well to make an examination into this matter\nof the plot against him in a public court, and to take for his assessors\nhis own kindred, and the governors of the province. And if those sons be\nfound guilty, to put them to death; but if they appear to have thought\nof no more than flying away from him, that he should moderate their punishment.", "With these directions Herod complied, and came to Berytus, where\nCaesar had ordered the court to be assembled, and got the judicature together.\nThe presidents sat first, as Caesar's letters had appointed, who were Saturninus\nand Pedanius, and their lieutenants that were with them, with whom was\nthe procurator Volumnius also; next to them sat the king's kinsmen and\nfriends, with Salome also, and Pheroras; after whom sat the principal men\nof all Syria, excepting Archelaus; for Herod had a suspicion of him, because\nhe was Alexander's father-in-law. Yet did not he produce his sons in open\ncourt; and this was done very cunningly, for he knew well enough that had\nthey but appeared only, they would certainly have been pitied; and if withal\nthey had been suffered to speak, Alexander would easily have answered what\nthey were accused of; but they were in custody at Platane, a village of\nthe Sidontans.", "So the king got up, and inveighed against his sons, as if they were\npresent; and as for that part of the accusation that they had plotted against\nhim, he urged it but faintly, because he was destitute of proofs; but he\ninsisted before the assessors on the reproaches, and jests, and injurious\ncarriage, and ten thousand the like offenses against him, which were heavier\nthan death itself; and when nobody contradicted him, he moved them to pity\nhis case, as though he had been condemned himself, now he had gained a\nbitter victory against his sons. So he asked every one's sentence, which\nsentence was first of all given by Saturninus, and was this: That he condemned\nthe young men, but not to death; for that it was not fit for him, who had\nthree sons of his own now present, to give his vote for the destruction\nof the sons of another. The two lieutenants also gave the like vote; some\nothers there were also who followed their example; but Volumnius began\nto vote on the more melancholy side, and all those that came after him\ncondemned the young men to die, some out of flattery, and some out of hatred\nto Herod; but none out of indignation at their crimes. And now all Syria\nand Judea was in great expectation, and waited for the last act of this\ntragedy; yet did nobody, suppose that Herod would be so barbarous as to\nmurder his children: however, he carried them away to Tyre, and thence\nsailed to Cesarea, and deliberated with himself what sort of death the\nyoung men should suffer.", "Now there was a certain old soldier of the king's, whose name was\nTero, who had a son that was very familiar with and a friend to Alexander,\nand who himself particularly loved the young men. This soldier was in a\nmanner distracted, out of the excess of the indignation he had at what\nwas doing; and at first he cried out aloud, as he went about, that justice\nwas trampled under foot; that truth was perished, and nature confounded;\nand that the life of man was full of iniquity, and every thing else that\npassion could suggest to a man who spared not his own life; and at last\nhe ventured to go to the king, and said, \"Truly I think thou art a\nmost miserable man, when thou hearkenest to most wicked wretches, against\nthose that ought to be dearest to thee; since thou hast frequently resolved\nthat Pheroras and Salome should be put to death, and yet believest them\nagainst thy sons; while these, by cutting off the succession of thine own\nsons, leave all wholly to Antipater, and thereby choose to have thee such\na king as may be thoroughly in their own power. However, consider whether\nthis death of Antipater's brethren will not make him hated by the soldiers;\nfor there is nobody but commiserates the young men; and of the captains,\na great many show their indignation at it openly.\" Upon his saying\nthis, he named those that had such indignation; but the king ordered those\nmen, with Tero himself and his son, to be seized upon immediately.", "At which time there was a certain barber, whose name was Trypho.\nThis man leaped out from among the people in a kind of madness, and accused\nhimself, and said, \"This Tero endeavored to persuade me also to cut\nthy throat with my razor, when I trimmed thee, and promised that Alexander\nshould give me large presents for so doing.\" When Herod heard this,\nhe examined Tero, with his son and the barber, by the torture; but as the\nothers denied the accusation, and he said nothing further, Herod gave order\nthat Tero should be racked more severely; but his son, out of pity to his\nfather, promised to discover the whole to the king, if he would grant [that\nhis father should be no longer tortured]. When he had agreed to this, he\nsaid that his father, at the persuasion of Alexander, had an intention\nto kill him. Now some said this was forged, in order to free his father\nfrom his torments; and some said it was true.", "And now Herod accused the captains and Tero in an assembly of the\npeople, and brought the people together in a body against them; and accordingly\nthere were they put to death, together with [Trypho] the barber; they were\nkilled by the pieces of wood and the stones that were thrown at them. He\nalso sent his sons to Sebaste, a city not far from Cesarea, and ordered\nthem to be there strangled; and as what he had ordered was executed immediately,\nso he commanded that their dead bodies should be brought to the fortress\nAlexandrium, to be buried with Alexander, their grandfather by the mother's\nside. And this was the end of Alexander and Aristobulus.", "BUT an intolerable hatred fell upon Antipater from the nation, though\nhe had now an indisputable title to the succession, because they all knew\nthat he was the person who contrived all the calumnies against his brethren.\nHowever, he began to be in a terrible fear, as he saw the posterity of\nthose that had been slain growing up; for Alexander had two sons by Glaphyra,\nTigranes and Alexander; and Aristobulus had Herod, and Agrippa, and Aristobulus,\nhis sons, with Herodias and Mariamne, his daughters, and all by Bernice,\nSalome's daughter. As for Glaphyra, Herod, as soon as he had killed Alexander,\nsent her back, together with her portion, to Cappadocia. He married Bernice,\nAristobulus's daughter, to Antipater's uncle by his mother, and it was\nAntipater who, in order to reconcile her to him, when she had been at variance\nwith him, contrived this match; he also got into Pheroras's favor, and\ninto the favor of Caesar's friends, by presents, and other ways of obsequiousness,\nand sent no small sums of money to Rome; Saturninus also, and his friends\nin Syria, were all well replenished with the presents he made them; yet\nthe more he gave, the more he was hated, as not making these presents out\nof generosity, but spending his money out of fear. Accordingly, it so fell\nout that the receivers bore him no more good-will than before, but that\nthose to whom he gave nothing were his more bitter enemies. However, he\nbestowed his money every day more and more profusely, on observing that,\ncontrary to his expectations, the king was taking care about the orphans,\nand discovering at the same time his repentance for killing their fathers,\nby his commiseration of those that sprang from them.", "Accordingly, Herod got together his kindred and friends, and set\nbefore them the children, and, with his eyes full of tears, said thus to\nthem: \"It was an unlucky fate that took away from me these children's\nfathers, which children are recommended to me by that natural commiseration\nwhich their orphan condition requires; however, I will endeavor, though\nI have been a most unfortunate father, to appear a better grandfather,\nand to leave these children such curators after myself as are dearest to\nme. I therefore betroth thy daughter, Pheroras, to the elder of these brethren,\nthe children of Alexander, that thou mayst be obliged to take care of them.\nI also betroth to thy son, Antipater, the daughter of Aristobulus; be thou\ntherefore a father to that orphan; and my son Herod [Philip] shall have\nher sister, whose grandfather, by the mother's side, was high priest. And\nlet every one that loves me be of my sentiments in these dispositions,\nwhich none that hath an affection for me will abrogate. And I pray God\nthat he will join these children together in marriage, to the advantage\nof my kingdom, and of my posterity; and may he look down with eyes more\nserene upon them than he looked upon their fathers.\"", "While he spake these words he wept, and joined the children's fight\nhands together; after which he embraced them every one after an affectionate\nmanner, and dismissed the assembly. Upon this, Antipater was in great disorder\nimmediately, and lamented publicly at what was done; for he supposed that\nthis dignity which was conferred on these orphans was for his own destruction,\neven in his father's lifetime, and that he should run another risk of losing\nthe government, if Alexander's sons should have both Archelaus [a king],\nand Pheroras a tetrarch, to support them. He also considered how he was\nhimself hated by the nation, and how they pitied these orphans; how great\naffection the Jews bare to those brethren of his when they were alive,\nand how gladly they remembered them now they had perished by his means.\nSo he resolved by all the ways possible to get these espousals dissolved.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Dean Aldrich takes notice here, that these nine wives of Herod were alive\nat the same time; and that if the celebrated Mariamne, who was now dead,\nbe reckoned, those wives were in all ten.

Now the king had nine wives, \nand children by seven of them; Antipater was himself born of Doris, and\nHerod Philip of Mariamne, the high priest's daughter; Antipas also and\nArchelaus were by Malthace, the Samaritan, as was his daughter Olympias,\nwhich his brother Joseph's \nson had married.

Pheroras also assisted him in his designs,\nlooking upon him as already fixed in the kingdom. There was also a company\nof women in the court, which excited new disturbances; for Pheroras's wife,\ntogether with her mother and sister, as also Antipater's mother, grew very\nimpudent in the palace. She also was so insolent as to affront the king's\ntwo daughters, \non which account the king hated her to a great degree; yet although these\nwomen were hated by him, they domineered over others: there was only Salome\nwho opposed their good agreement, and informed the king of their meetings,\nas not being for the advantage of his affairs.

Now though Antipater\ndid not transgress that his injunction publicly, yet did he in secret come\nto their night meetings; and because he was afraid that Salome observed\nwhat he did, he procured, by the means of his Italian friends, that he\nmight go and live at Rome; for when they wrote that it was proper for Antipater\nto be sent to Caesar for some time, Herod made no delay, but sent him,\nand that with a splendid attendance, and a great deal of money, and gave\nhim his testament to carry with him, - wherein Antipater had the kingdom\nbequeathed to him, and wherein Herod was named for Antipater's successor;\nthat Herod, I mean, who was the son of Mariarmne, the high priest's daughter.", "Sylleus also, the Arabian, sailed to Rome, without any regard to\nCaesar's injunctions, and this in order to oppose Antipater with all his\nmight, as to that law-suit which Nicolaus had with him before. This Sylleus\nhad also a great contest with Aretas his own king; for he had slain many\nothers of Aretas's friends, and particularly Sohemus, the most potent man\nin the city Petra. Moreover, he had prevailed with Phabatus, who was Herod's\nsteward, by giving him a great sum of money, to assist him against Herod;\nbut when Herod gave him more, he induced him to leave Syllcus, and by this\nmeans he demanded of him all that Caesar had required of him to pay. But\nwhen Sylleus paid nothing of what he was to pay, and did also accuse Phabatus\nto Caesar, and said that he was not a steward for Caesar's advantage, but\nfor Herod's, Phabatus was angry at him on that account, but was still in\nvery great esteem with Herod, and discovered Sylleus's grand secrets, and\ntold the king that Sylleus had corrupted Corinthus, one of the guards of\nhis body, by bribing him, and of whom he must therefore have a care. Accordingly,\nthe king complied; for this Corinthus, though he was brought up in Herod's\nkingdom, yet was he by birth an Arabian; so the king ordered him to be\ntaken up immediately, and not only him, but two other Arabians, who were\ncaught with him; the one of them was Sylleus's friend, the other the head\nof a tribe. These last, being put to the torture, confessed that they had\nprevailed with Corinthus, for a large sum of money, to kill Herod; and\nwhen they had been further examined before Saturninus, the president of\nSyria, they were sent to Rome.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This strange obstinacy of Pheroras in retaining his wife, who was one of\na low family, and refusing to marry one nearly related to Herod, though\nhe so earnestly desired it, as also that wife's admission to the counsels\nof the other great court ladies, together with Herod's own importunity\nas to Pheroras's divorce and other marriage, all so remarkable here, or\nin the Antiquities XVII. ch. 2. sect. 4; and ch. 3. be well accounted for,\nbut on the supposal that Pheroras believed, and Herod suspected, that the\nPharisees' prediction, as if the crown of Judea should be translated from\nHerod to Pheroras's posterity and that most probably to Pheroras's posterity\nby this his wife, also would prove true.

Pheroras took this injury very patiently, and went\naway into his own tetrarchy, [Perea beyond Jordan,] and sware that there\nshould be but one end put to his flight, and that should be Herod's death;\nand that he would never return while he was alive. Nor indeed would he\nreturn when his brother was sick, although he earnestly sent for him to\ncome to him, because he had a mind to leave some injunctions with him before\nhe died; but Herod unexpectedly recovered. A little afterward Pheroras\nhimself fell sick, when Herod showed great moderation; for he came to him,\nand pitied his case, and took care of him; but his affection for him did\nhim no good, for Pheroras died a little afterward. Now though Herod had\nso great an affection for him to the last day of his life, yet was a report\nspread abroad that he had killed him by poison. However, he took care to\nhave his dead body carried to Jerusalem, and appointed a very great mourning\nto the whole nation for him, and bestowed a most pompous funeral upon him.\nAnd this was the end that one of Alexander's and Aristobulus's murderers\ncame to."}, "BUT now the punishment was transferred unto the original author,\nAntipater, and took its rise from the death of Pheroras; for certain of\nhis freed-men came with a sad countenance to the king, and told him that\nhis brother had been destroyed by poison, and that his wife had brought\nhim somewhat that was prepared after an unusual manner, and that, upon\nhis eating it, he presently fell into his distemper; that Antipater's mother\nand sister, two days before, brought a woman out of Arabia that was skillful\nin mixing such drugs, that she might prepare a love potion for Pheroras;\nand that instead of a love potion, she had given him deadly poison; and\nthat this was done by the management of Sylleus, who was acquainted with\nthat woman.", "The king was deeply affected with so many suspicions, and had the\nmaid-servants and some of the free women also tortured; one of which cried\nout in her agonies, \"May that God that governs the earth and the heaven\npunish this author of all these our miseries, Antipater's mother!\"\nThe king took a handle from this confession, and proceeded to inquire further\ninto the truth of the matter. So this woman discovered the friendship of\nAntipater's mother to Pheroras, and Antipater's women, as also their secret\nmeetings, and that Pheroras and Antipater had drunk with them for a whole\nnight together as they returned from the king, and would not suffer any\nbody, either man-servant or maidservant, to be there; while one of the\nfree women discovered the matter.", "Upon this Herod tortured the maid-servants every on by themselves\nseparately, who all unanimously agreed in the foregoing discoveries, and\nthat accordingly by agreement they went away, Antipater to Rome, and Pheroras\nto Perea; for that they oftentimes talked to one another thus: That after\nHerod had slain Alexander and Aristobulus, he would fall upon them, and\nupon their wives, because, after he Mariamne and her children he would\nspare nobody; and that for this reason it was best to get as far off the\nwild beast as they were able: - and that Antipater oftentimes lamented\nhis own case before his mother, and said to her, that he had already gray\nhairs upon his head, and that his father grew younger again every day,\nand that perhaps death would overtake him before he should begin to be\na king in earnest; and that in case Herod should die, which yet nobody\nknew when it would be, the enjoyment of the succession could certainly\nbe but for a little time; for that these heads of Hydra, the sons of Alexander\nand Aristobulus, were growing up: that he was deprived by his father of\nthe hopes of being succeeded by his children, for that his successor after\nhis death was not to be any one of his own sons, but Herod the son of Mariamne:\nthat in this point Herod was plainly distracted, to think that his testament\nshould therein take place; for he would take care that not one of his posterity\nshould remain, because he was of all fathers the greatest hater of his\nchildren. Yet does he hate his brother still worse; whence it was that\nhe a while ago gave himself a hundred talents, that he should not have\nany intercourse with Pheroras. And when Pheroras said, Wherein have we\ndone him any harm? Antipater replied, \"I wish he would but deprive\nus of all we have, and leave us naked and alive only; but it is indeed\nimpossible to escape this wild beast, who is thus given to murder, who\nwill not permit us to love any person openly, although we be together privately;\nyet may we be so openly too, if we have but the courage and the hands of\nmen.\"", "These things were said by the women upon the torture; as also that\nPheroras resolved to fly with them to Perea. Now Herod gave credit to all\nthey said, on account of the affair of the hundred talents; for he had\nno discourse with any body about them, but only with Antipater. So he vented\nhis anger first of all against Antipater's mother, and took away from her\nall the ornaments which he had given her, which cost a great many talents,\nand cast her out of the palace a second time. He also took care of Pheroras's\nwomen after their tortures, as being now reconciled to them; but he was\nin great consternation himself, and inflamed upon every suspicion, and\nhad many innocent persons led to the torture, out of his fear lest he should\nleave any guilty person untortured.", "And now it was that he betook himself to examine Antipater of Samaria,\nwho was the steward of [his son] Antipater; and upon torturing him, he\nlearned that Antipater had sent for a potion of deadly poison for him out\nof Egypt, by Antiphilus, a companion of his; that Theudio, the uncle of\nAntipater, had it from him, and delivered it to Pheroras; for that Antipater\nhad charged him to take his father off while he was at Rome, and so free\nhim from the suspicion of doing it himself: that Pheroras also committed\nthis potion to his wife. Then did the king send for her, and bid her bring\nto him what she had received immediately. So she came out of her house\nas if she would bring it with her, but threw herself down from the top\nof the house, in order to prevent any examination and torture from the\nking. However, it came to pass, as it seems by the providence of God, when\nhe intended to bring Antipater to punishment, that she fell not upon her\nhead, but upon other parts of her body, and escaped. The king, when she\nwas brought to him, took care of her, (for she was at first quite senseless\nupon her fall,) and asked her why she had thrown herself down; and gave\nher his oath, that if she would speak the real truth, he would excuse her\nfrom punishment; but that if she concealed any thing, he would have her\nbody torn to pieces by torments, and leave no part. of it to be buried.", "Upon this the woman paused a little, and then said, \"Why do\nI spare to speak of these grand secrets, now Pheroras is dead? that would\nonly tend to save Antipater, who is all our destruction. Hear then, O king,\nand be thou, and God himself, who cannot be deceived, witnesses to the\ntruth of what I am going to say. When thou didst sit weeping by Pheroras\nas he was dying, then it was that he called me to him, and said, My dear\nwife, I have been greatly mistaken as to the disposition of my brother\ntowards me, and have hated him that is so affectionate to me, and have\ncontrived to kill him who is in such disorder for me before I am dead.\nAs for myself, I receive the recompence of my impiety; but do thou bring\nwhat poison was left with us by Antipater, and which thou keepest in order\nto destroy him, and consume it immediately in the fire in my sight, that\nI may not be liable to the avenger in the invisible world.\" This I\nbrought as he bid me, and emptied the greatest part of it into the fire,\nbut reserved a little of it for my own use against uncertain futurity,\nand out of my fear of thee.\"", "When she had said this, she brought the box, which had a small quantity\nof this potion in it: but the king let her alone, and transferred the tortures\nto Antiphilus's mother and brother; who both confessed that Antiphilus\nbrought the box out of Egypt, and that they had received the potion from\na brother of his, who was a physician at Alexandria. Then did the ghosts\nof Alexander and Aristobulus go round all the palace, and became the inquisitors\nand discoverers of what could not otherwise have been found out and brought\nsuch as were the freest from suspicion to be examined; whereby it was discovered\nthat Mariamne, the high priest's daughter, was conscious of this plot;\nand her very brothers, when they were tortured, declared it so to be. Whereupon\nthe king avenged this insolent attempt of the mother upon her son, and\nblotted Herod, whom he had by her, out of his treament, who had been before\nnamed therein as successor to Antipater.", "AFTER these things were over, Bathyllus came under examination, in\norder to convict Antipater, who proved the concluding attestation to Antipater's\ndesigns; for indeed he was no other than his freed-man. This man came,\nand brought another deadly potion, the poison of asps, and the juices of\nother serpents, that if the first potion did not do the business, Pheroras\nand his wife might be armed with this also to destroy the king. He brought\nalso an addition to Antipater's insolent attempt against his father, which\nwas the letters which he wrote against his brethren, Archelaus and Philip,\nwhich were the king's sons, and educated at Rome, being yet youths, but\nof generous dispositions. Antipater set himself to get rid of these as\nsoon as he could, that they might not be prejudicial to his hopes; and\nto that end he forged letters against them in the name of his friends at\nRome. Some of these he corrupted by bribes to write how they grossly reproached\ntheir father, and did openly bewail Alexander and Aristobulus, and were\nuneasy at their being recalled; for their father had already sent for them,\nwhich was the very thing that troubled Antipater.", "Nay, indeed, while Antipater was in Judea, and before he was upon\nhis journey to Rome, he gave money to have the like letters against them\nsent from Rome, and then came to his father, who as yet had no suspicion\nof him, and apologized for his brethren, and alleged on their behalf that\nsome of the things contained in those letters were false, and others of\nthem were only youthful errors. Yet at the same time that he expended a\ngreat deal of his money, by making presents to such as wrote against his\nbrethren, did he aim to bring his accounts into confusion, by buying costly\ngarments, and carpets of various contextures, with silver and gold cups,\nand a great many more curious things, that so, among the view great expenses\nlaid out upon such furniture, he might conceal the money he had used in\nhiring men [to write the letters]; for he brought in an account of his\nexpenses, amounting to two hundred talents, his main pretense for which\nwas file law-suit he had been in with Sylleus. So while all his rogueries,\neven those of a lesser sort also, were covered by his greater villainy,\nwhile all the examinations by torture proclaimed his attempt to murder\nhis father, and the letters proclaimed his second attempt to murder his\nbrethren; yet did no one of those that came to Rome inform him of his misfortunes\nin Judea, although seven months had intervened between his conviction and\nhis return, so great was the hatred which they all bore to him. And perhaps\nthey were the ghosts of those brethren of his that had been murdered that\nstopped the mouths of those that intended to have told him. He then wrote\nfrom Rome, and informed his [friends] that he would soon come to them,\nand how he was dismissed with honor by Caesar.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This Tarentum has coins still extant, as Reland informs us here in his\nnote."}, "#text": "Now the king, being desirous to get this plotter against him into\nhis hands, and being also afraid lest he should some way come to the knowledge\nhow his affairs stood, and be upon his guard, he dissembled his anger in\nhis epistle to him, as in other points he wrote kindly to him, and desired\nhim to make haste, because if he came quickly, he would then lay aside\nthe complaints he had against his mother; for Antipater was not ignorant\nthat his mother had been expelled out of the palace. However, he had before\nreceived a letter, which contained an account of the death of Pheroras,\nat Tarentum, \nand made great lamentations at it; for which some commended him, as being\nfor his own uncle; though probably this confusion arose on account of his\nhaving thereby failed in his plot [on his father's life]; and his tears\nwere more for the loss of him that was to have been subservient therein,\nthan for [an uncle] Pheroras: moreover, a sort of fear came upon him as\nto his designs, lest the poison should have been discovered. However, when\nhe was in Cilicia, he received the forementioned epistle from his father,\nand made great haste accordingly. But when he had sailed to Celenderis,\na suspicion came into his mind relating to his mother's misfortunes; as\nif his soul foreboded some mischief to itself. Those therefore of his friends\nwhich were the most considerate advised him not rashly to go to his father,\ntill he had learned what were the occasions why his mother had been ejected,\nbecause they were afraid that he might be involved in the calumnies that\nhad been cast upon his mother: but those that were less considerate, and\nhad more regard to their own desires of seeing their native country, than\nto Antipater's safety, persuaded him to make haste home, and not, by delaying\nhis journey, afford his father ground for an ill suspicion, and give a\nhandle to those that raised stories against him; for that in case any thing\nhad been moved to his disadvantage, it was owing to his absence, which\ndurst not have been done had he been present. And they said it was absurd\nto deprive himself of certain happiness, for the sake of an uncertain suspicion,\nand not rather to return to his father, and take the royal authority upon\nhim, which was in a state of fluctuation on his account only. Antipater\ncomplied with this last advice, for Providence hurried him on [to his destruction].\nSo he passed over the sea, and landed at Sebastus, the haven of Cesarea."}, "And here he found a perfect and unexpected solitude, while ever body\navoided him, and nobody durst come at him; for he was equally hated by\nall men; and now that hatred had liberty to show itself, and the dread\nmen were in at the king's anger made men keep from him; for the whole city\n[of Jerusalem] was filled with the rumors about Antipater, and Antipater\nhimself was the only person who was ignorant of them; for as no man was\ndismissed more magnificently when he began his voyage to Rome so was no\nman now received back with greater ignominy. And indeed he began already\nto suspect what misfortunes there were in Herod's family; yet did he cunningly\nconceal his suspicion; and while he was inwardly ready to die for fear,\nhe put on a forced boldness of countenance. Nor could he now fly any whither,\nnor had he any way of emerging out of the difficulties which encompassed\nhim; nor indeed had he even there any certain intelligence of the affairs\nof the royal family, by reason of the threats the king had given out: yet\nhad he some small hopes of better tidings; for perhaps nothing had been\ndiscovered; or if any discovery had been made, perhaps he should be able\nto clear himself by impudence and artful tricks, which were the only things\nhe relied upon for his deliverance.", "And with these hopes did he screen himself, till he came to the palace,\nwithout any friends with him; for these were affronted, and shut out at\nthe first gate. Now Varus, the president of Syria, happened to be in the\npalace [at this juncture]; so Antipater went in to his father, and, putting\non a bold face, he came near to salute him. But Herod Stretched out his\nhands, and turned his head away from him, and cried out, \"Even this\nis an indication of a parricide, to be desirous to get me into his arms,\nwhen he is under such heinous accusations. God confound thee, thou vile\nwretch; do not thou touch me, till thou hast cleared thyself of these crimes\nthat are charged upon thee. I appoint thee a court where thou art to be\njudged, and this Varus, who is very seasonably here, to be thy judge; and\nget thou thy defense ready against tomorrow, for I give thee so much time\nto prepare suitable excuses for thyself.\" And as Antipater was so\nconfounded, that he was able to make no answer to this charge, he went\naway; but his mother and wife came to him, and told him of all the evidence\nthey had gotten against him. Hereupon he recollected himself, and considered\nwhat defense he should make against the accusations.", "NOW the day following the king assembled a court of his kinsmen and\nfriends, and called in Antipater's friends also. Herod himself, with Varus,\nwere the presidents; and Herod called for all the witnesses, and ordered\nthem to be brought in; among whom some of the domestic servants of Antipater's\nmother were brought in also, who had but a little while before been caught,\nas they were carrying the following letter from her to her son: \"Since\nall those things have been already discovered to thy father, do not thou\ncome to him, unless thou canst procure some assistance from Caesar.\"\nWhen this and the other witnesses were introduced, Antipater came in, and\nfalling on his face before his father's feet, he said, \"Father, I\nbeseech thee, do not condemn me beforehand, but let thy ears be unbiassed,\nand attend to my defense; for if thou wilt give me leave, I will demonstrate\nthat I am innocent.\"", "Hereupon Herod cried out to him to hold his peace, and spake thus\nto Varus: \"I cannot but think that thou, Varus, and every other upright\njudge, will determine that Antipater is a vile wretch. I am also afraid\nthat thou wilt abhor my ill fortune, and judge me also myself worthy of\nall sorts of calamity for begetting such children; while yet I ought rather\nto be pitied, who have been so affectionate a father to such wretched sons;\nfor when I had settled the kingdom on my former sons, even when they were\nyoung, and when, besides the charges of their education at Rome, I had\nmade them the friends of Caesar, and made them envied by other kings, I\nfound them plotting against me. These have been put to death, and that,\nin great measure, for the sake of Antipater; for as he was then young,\nand appointed to be my successor, I took care chiefly to secure him from\ndanger: but this profligate wild beast, when he had been over and above\nsatiated with that patience which I showed him, he made use of that abundance\nI had given him against myself; for I seemed to him to live too long, and\nhe was very uneasy at the old age I was arrived at; nor could he stay any\nlonger, but would be a king by parricide. And justly I am served by him\nfor bringing him back out of the country to court, when he was of no esteem\nbefore, and for thrusting out those sons of mine that were born of the\nqueen, and for making him a successor to my dominions. I confess to thee,\nO Varus, the great folly I was guilty for I provoked those sons of mine\nto act against me, and cut off their just expectations for the sake of\nAntipater; and indeed what kindness did I do them; that could equal what\nI have done to Antipater? to I have, in a manner, yielded up my royal while\nI am alive, and whom I have openly named for the successor to my dominions\nin my testament, and given him a yearly revenue of his own of fifty talents,\nand supplied him with money to an extravagant degree out of my own revenue;\nand' when he was about to sail to Rome, I gave him three talents, and recommended\nhim, and him alone of all my children, to Caesar, as his father's deliverer.\nNow what crimes were those other sons of mine guilty of like these of Antipater?\nand what evidence was there brought against them so strong as there is\nto demonstrate this son to have plotted against me? Yet does this parricide\npresume to speak for himself, and hopes to obscure the truth by his cunning\ntricks. Thou, O Varus, must guard thyself against him; for I know the wild\nbeast, and I foresee how plausibly he will talk, and his counterfeit lamentation.\nThis was he who exhorted me to have a care of Alexander when he was alive,\nand not to intrust my body with all men! This was he who came to my very\nbed, and looked about lest any one should lay snares for me! This was he\nwho took care of my sleep, and secured me from fear of danger, who comforted\nme under the trouble I was in upon the slaughter of my sons, and looked\nto see what affection my surviving brethren bore me! This was my protector,\nand the guardian of my body! And when I call to mind, O Varus, his craftiness\nupon every occasion, and his art of dissembling, I can hardly believe that\nI am still alive, and I wonder how I have escaped such a deep plotter of\nmischief. However, since some fate or other makes my house desolate, and\nperpetually raises up those that are dearest to me against me, I will,\nwith tears, lament my hard fortune, and privately groan under my lonesome\ncondition; yet am I resolved that no one who thirsts after my blood shall\nescape punishment, although the evidence should extend itself to all my\nsons.\"", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "A lover of his father."}, "#text": "Upon Herod's saying this, he was interrupted by the confusion he\nwas in; but ordered Nicolaus, one of his friends, to produce the evidence\nagainst Antipater. But in the mean time Antipater lifted up his head, (for\nhe lay on the ground before his father's feet,) and cried out aloud, \"Thou,\nO father, hast made my apology for me; for how can I be a parricide, whom\nthou thyself confessest to have always had for thy guardian? Thou callest\nmy filial affection prodigious lies and hypocrisy! how then could it be\nthat I, who was so subtle in other matters, should here be so mad as not\nto understand that it was not easy that he who committed so horrid a crime\nshould be concealed from men, but impossible that he should be concealed\nfrom the Judge of heaven, who sees all things, and is present every where?\nor did not I know what end my brethren came to, on whom God inflicted so\ngreat a punishment for their evil designs against thee? And indeed what\nwas there that could possibly provoke me against thee? Could the hope of\nbeing king do it? I was a king already. Could I suspect hatred from thee?\nNo. Was not I beloved by thee? And what other fear could I have? Nay, by\npreserving thee safe, I was a terror to others. Did I want money? No; for\nwho was able to expend so much as myself? Indeed, father, had I been the\nmost execrable of all mankind, and had I had the soul of the most cruel\nwild beast, must I not have been overcome with the benefits thou hadst\nbestowed upon me? whom, as thou thyself sayest, thou broughtest [into the\npalace]; whom thou didst prefer before so many of thy sons; whom thou madest\na king in thine own lifetime, and, by the vast magnitude of the other advantages\nthou bestowedst on me, thou madest me an object of envy. O miserable man!\nthat thou shouldst undergo this bitter absence, and thereby afford a great\nopportunity for envy to arise against thee, and a long space for such as\nwere laying designs against thee! Yet was I absent, father, on thy affairs,\nthat Sylleus might not treat thee with contempt in thine old age. Rome\nis a witness to my filial affection, and so is Caesar, the ruler of the\nhabitable earth, who oftentimes called me Philopater. \nTake here the letters he hath sent thee, they are more to be believed than\nthe calumnies raised here; these letters are my only apology; these I use\nas the demonstration of that natural affection I have to thee. Remember\nthat it was against my own choice that I sailed [to Rome], as knowing the\nlatent hatred that was in the kingdom against me. It was thou, O father,\nhowever unwillingly, who hast been my ruin, by forcing me to allow time\nfor calumnies against me, and envy at me. However, I am come hither, and\nam ready to hear the evidence there is against me. If I be a parricide,\nI have passed by land and by sea, without suffering any misfortune on either\nof them: but this method of trial is no advantage to me; for it seems,\nO father, that I am already condemned, both before God and before thee;\nand as I am already condemned, I beg that thou wilt not believe the others\nthat have been tortured, but let fire be brought to torment me; let the\nracks march through my bowels; have no regard to any lamentations that\nthis polluted body can make; for if I be a parricide, I ought not to die\nwithout torture.\" Thus did Antipater cry out with lamentation and\nweeping, and moved all the rest, and Varus in particular, to commiserate\nhis case. Herod was the only person whose passion was too strong to permit\nhim to weep, as knowing that the testimonies against him were true."}, "And now it was that, at the king's command, Nicolaus, when he had\npremised a great deal about the craftiness of Antipater, and had prevented\nthe effects of their commiseration to him, afterwards brought in a bitter\nand large accusation against him, ascribing all the wickedness that had\nbeen in the kingdom to him, and especially the murder of his brethren;\nand demonstrated that they had perished by the calumnies he had raised\nagainst them. He also said that he had laid designs against them that were\nstill alive, as if they were laying plots for the succession; and (said\nhe) how can it be supposed that he who prepared poison for his father should\nabstain from mischief as to his brethren? He then proceeded to convict\nhim of the attempt to poison Herod, and gave an account in order of the\nseveral discoveries that had been made; and had great indignation as to\nthe affair of Pheroras, because Antipater had been for making him murder\nhis brother, and had corrupted those that were dearest to the king, and\nfilled the whole palace with wickedness; and when he had insisted on many\nother accusations, and the proofs for them, he left off.", "Then Varus bid Antipater make his defense; but he lay along in silence,\nand said no more but this, \"God is my witness that I am entirely innocent.\"\nSo Varus asked for the potion, and gave it to be drunk by a condemned malefactor,\nwho was then in prison, who died upon the spot. So Varus, when he had had\na very private discourse with Herod, and had written an account of this\nassembly to Caesar, went away, after a day's stay. The king also bound\nAntipater, and sent away to inform Caesar of his misfortunes.", "Now after this it was discovered that Antipater had laid a plot against\nSalome also; for one of Antiphilus's domestic servants came, and brought\nletters from Rome, from a maid-servant of Julia, [Caesar's wife,] whose\nname was Acme. By her a message was sent to the king, that she had found\na letter written by Salome, among Julia's papers, and had sent it to him\nprivately, out of her good-will to him. This letter of Salome contained\nthe most bitter reproaches of the king, and the highest accusations against\nhim. Antipater had forged this letter, and had corrupted Acme, and persuaded\nher to send it to Herod. This was proved by her letter to Antipater, for\nthus did this woman write to him: \"As thou desirest, I have written\na letter to thy father, and have sent that letter, and am persuaded that\nthe king will not spare his sister when he reads it. Thou wilt do well\nto remember what thou hast promised when all is accomplished.\"", "When this epistle was discovered, and what the epistle forged against\nSalome contained, a suspicion came into the king's mind, that perhaps the\nletters against Alexander were also forged: he was moreover greatly disturbed,\nand in a passion, because he had almost slain his sister on Antipater's\naccount. He did no longer delay therefore to bring him to punishment for\nall his crimes; yet when he was eagerly pursuing Antipater, he was restrained\nby a severe distemper he fell into. However, he sent all account to Caesar\nabout Acme, and the contrivances against Salome; he sent also for his testament,\nand altered it, and therein made Antipas king, as taking no care of Archclaus\nand Philip, because Antipater had blasted their reputations with him; but\nhe bequeathed to Caesar, besides other presents that he gave him, a thousand\ntalents; as also to his wife, and children, and friends, and freed-men\nabout five hundred: he also bequeathed to all others a great quantity of\nland, and of money, and showed his respects to Salome his sister, by giving\nher most splendid gifts. And this was what was contained in his testament,\nas it was now altered.", "NOW Herod's distemper became more and more severe to him, and this\nbecause these his disorders fell upon him in his old age, and when he was\nin a melancholy condition; for he was already seventy years of age, and\nhad been brought by the calamities that happened to him about his children,\nwhereby he had no pleasure in life, even when he was in health; the grief\nalso that Antipater was still alive aggravated his disease, whom he resolved\nto put to death now not at random, but as soon as he should be well again,\nand resolved to have him slain [in a public manner].", "There also now happened to him, among his other calamities, a certain\npopular sedition. There were two men of learning in the city [Jerusalem,]\nwho were thought the most skillful in the laws of their country, and were\non that account had in very great esteem all over the nation; they were,\nthe one Judas, the son of Sepphoris, and the other Mattbias, the son of\nMargalus. There was a great concourse of the young men to these men when\nthey expounded the laws, and there got together every day a kind of an\narmy of such as were growing up to be men. Now when these men were informed\nthat the king was wearing away with melancholy, and with a distemper, they\ndropped words to their acquaintance, how it was now a very proper time\nto defend the cause of God, and to pull down what had been erected contrary\nto the laws of their country; for it was unlawful there should be any such\nthing in the temple as images, or faces, or the like representation of\nany animal whatsoever. Now the king had put up a golden eagle over the\ngreat gate of the temple, which these learned men exhorted them to cut\ndown; and told them, that if there should any danger arise, it was a glorious\nthing to die for the laws of their country; because that the soul was immortal,\nand that an eternal enjoyment of happiness did await such as died on that\naccount; while the mean-spirited, and those that were not wise enough to\nshow a right love of their souls, preferred a death by a disease, before\nthat which is the result of a virtuous behavior.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Since in these two sections we have an evident account of the Jewish opinions\nin the days of Josephus, about a future happy state, and the resurrection\nof the dead, as in the New Testament, John 11:24, I shall here refer to\nthe other places in Josephus, before he became a catholic Christian, which\nconcern the same matters.

This was presently told to the king's captain of the temple,\nwho came running with a great body of soldiers, and caught about forty\nof the young men, and brought them to the king. And when he asked them,\nfirst of all, whether they had been so hardy as to cut down the golden\neagle, they confessed they had done so; and when he asked them by whose\ncommand they had done it, they replied, at the command of the law of their\ncountry; and when he further asked them how they could be so joyful when\nthey were to be put to death, they replied, because they should enjoy greater\nhappiness after they were dead."}, "At this the king was in such an extravagant passion, that he overcame\nhis disease [for the time,] and went out, and spake to the people; wherein\nhe made a terrible accusation against those men, as being guilty of sacrilege,\nand as making greater attempts under pretense of their law, and he thought\nthey deserved to be punished as impious persons. Whereupon the people were\nafraid lest a great number should be found guilty and desired that when\nhe had first punished those that put them upon this work, and then those\nthat were caught in it, he would leave off his anger as to the rest. With\nthis the king complied, though not without difficulty, and ordered those\nthat had let themselves down, together with their Rabbins, to be burnt\nalive, but delivered the rest that were caught to the proper officers,\nto be put to death by them.", "After this, the distemper seized upon his whole body, and greatly\ndisordered all its parts with various symptoms; for there was a gentle\nfever upon him, and an intolerable itching over all the surface of his\nbody, and continual pains in his colon, and dropsical turnouts about his\nfeet, and an inflammation of the abdomen, and a putrefaction of his privy\nmember, that produced worms. Besides which he had a difficulty of breathing\nupon him, and could not breathe but when he sat upright, and had a convulsion\nof all his members, insomuch that the diviners said those diseases were\na punishment upon him for what he had done to the Rabbins. Yet did he struggle\nwith his numerous disorders, and still had a desire to live, and hoped\nfor recovery, and considered of several methods of cure. Accordingly, he\nwent over Jordan, and made use of those hot baths at Callirrhoe, which\nran into the lake Asphaltitis, but are themselves sweet enough to be drunk.\nAnd here the physicians thought proper to bathe his whole body in warm\noil, by letting it down into a large vessel full of oil; whereupon his\neyes failed him, and he came and went as if he was dying; and as a tumult\nwas then made by his servants, at their voice he revived again. Yet did\nhe after this despair of recovery, and gave orders that each soldier should\nhave fifty drachmae a-piece, and that his commanders and friends should\nhave great sums of money given them.", "He then returned back and came to Jericho, in such a melancholy state\nof body as almost threatened him with present death, when he proceeded\nto attempt a horrid wickedness; for he got together the most illustrious\nmen of the whole Jewish nation, out of every village, into a place called\nthe Hippodrome, and there shut them in. He then called for his sister Salome,\nand her husband Alexas, and made this speech to them: \"I know well\nenough that the Jews will keep a festival upon my death however, it is\nin my power to be mourned for on other accounts, and to have a splendid\nfuneral, if you will but be subservient to my commands. Do you but take\ncare to send soldiers to encompass these men that are now in custody, and\nslay them immediately upon my death, and then all Judea, and every family\nof them, will weep at it, whether they will or no.\"", "These were the commands he gave them; when there came letters from\nhis ambassadors at Rome, whereby information was given that Acme was put\nto death at Caesar's command, and that Antipater was condemned to die;\nhowever, they wrote withal, that if Herod had a mind rather to banish him,\nCaesar permitted him so to do. So he for a little while revived, and had\na desire to live; but presently after he was overborne by his pains, and\nwas disordered by want of food, and by a convulsive cough, and endeavored\nto prevent a natural, death; so he took an apple, and asked for a knife\nfor he used to pare apples and eat them; he then looked round about to\nsee that there was nobody to hinder him, and lift up his right hand as\nif he would stab himself; but Achiabus, his first cousin, came running\nto him, and held his hand, and hindered him from so doing; on which occasion\na very great lamentation was made in the palace, as if the king were expiring.\nAs soon as ever Antipater heard that, he took courage, and with joy in\nhis looks, besought his keepers, for a sum of money, to loose him and let\nhim go; but the principal keeper of the prison did not only obstruct him\nin that his intention, but ran and told the king what his design was; hereupon\nthe king cried out louder than his distemper would well bear, and immediately\nsent some of his guards and slew Antipater; he also gave order to have\nhim buried at Hyrcanium, and altered his testament again, and therein made\nArchclaus, his eldest son, and the brother of Antipas, his successor, and\nmade Antipas tetrarch.", "So Herod, having survived the slaughter of his son five days, died,\nhaving reigned thirty-four years since he had caused Antigonus to be slain,\nand obtained his kingdom; but thirty-seven years since he had been made\nking by the Romans. Now as for his fortune, it was prosperous in all other\nrespects, if ever any other man could be so, since, from a private man,\nhe obtained the kingdom, and kept it so long, and left it to his own sons;\nbut still in his domestic affairs he was a most unfortunate man. Now, before\nthe soldiers knew of his death, Salome and her husband came out and dismissed\nthose that were in bonds, whom the king had commanded to be slain, and\ntold them that he had altered his mind, and would have every one of them\nsent to their own homes. When these men were gone, Salome, told the soldiers\n[the king was dead], and got them and the rest of the multitude together\nto an assembly, in the amphitheater at Jericho, where Ptolemy, who was\nintrusted by the king with his signet ring, came before them, and spake\nof the happiness the king had attained, and comforted the multitude, and\nread the epistle which had been left for the soldiers, wherein he earnestly\nexhorted them to bear good-will to his successor; and after he had read\nthe epistle, he opened and read his testament, wherein Philip was to inherit\nTrachonitis, and the neighboring countries, and Antipas was to be tetrarch,\nas we said before, and Archelaus was made king. He had also been commanded\nto carry Herod's ring to Caesar, and the settlements he had made, sealed\nup, because Caesar was to be lord of all the settlements he had made, and\nwas to confirm his testament; and he ordered that the dispositions he had\nmade were to be kept as they were in his former testament.", "So there was an acclamation made to Archelaus, to congratulate him\nupon his advancement; and the soldiers, with the multitude, went round\nabout in troops, and promised him their good-will, and besides, prayed\nGod to bless his government. After this, they betook themselves to prepare\nfor the king's funeral; and Archelaus omitted nothing of magnificence therein,\nbut brought out all the royal ornaments to augment the pomp of the deceased.\nThere was a bier all of gold, embroidered with precious stones, and a purple\nbed of various contexture, with the dead body upon it, covered with purple;\nand a diadem was put upon his head, and a crown of gold above it, and a\nsecptre in his right hand; and near to the bier were Herod's sons, and\na multitude of his kindred; next to which came his guards, and the regiment\nof Thracians, the Germans. also and Gauls, all accounted as if they were\ngoing to war; but the rest of the army went foremost, armed, and following\ntheir captains and officers in a regular manner; after whom five hundred\nof his domestic servants and freed-men followed, with sweet spices in their\nhands: and the body was carried two hundred furlongs, to Herodium, where\nhe had given order to be buried.

B. XVII. ch.\n8. sect. 4; whence the author of the Book of Ecclesiasticus, ch. 22:12,\nassigns seven days as the proper time of mourning for the dead, and, ch.\n38:17, enjoins men to mourn for the dead, that they may not be evil spoken\nof; for, as Josephus says presently, if any one omits this mourning [funeral\nfeast], he is not esteemed a holy person. How it is certain that such a\nseven days' mourning has been customary from times of the greatest antiquity,\nGenesis 1:10. Funeral feasts are also mentioned as of considerable antiquity,\nEzekiel 24:17; Jeremiah 16:7; Prey. 31:6; Deuteronomy 26:14; Josephus,\nOf the War B. III. ch. 9. sect. 5."}, "#text": "NOW the necessity which Archelaus was under of taking a journey to\nRome was the occasion of new disturbances; for when he had mourned for\nhis father seven days, \nand had given a very expensive funeral feast to the multitude, (which custom\nis the occasion of poverty to many of the Jews, because they are forced\nto feast the multitude; for if any one omits it, he is not esteemed a holy\nperson,) he put on a white garment, and went up to the temple, where the\npeople accosted him with various acclamations. He also spake kindly to\nthe multitude from an elevated seat and a throne of gold, and returned\nthem thanks for the zeal they had shown about his father's funeral, and\nthe submission they had made to him, as if he were already settled in the\nkingdom; but he told them withal, that he would not at present take upon\nhim either the authority of a king, or the names thereto belonging, until\nCaesar, who is made lord of this whole affair by the testament, confirm\nthe succession; for that when the soldiers would have set the diadem on\nhis head at Jericho, he would not accept of it; but that he would make\nabundant requitals, not to the soldiers only, but to the people, for their\nalacrity and good-will to him, when the superior lords [the Romans] should\nhave given him a complete title to the kingdom; for that it should be his\nstudy to appear in all things better than his father."}, "Upon this the multitude were pleased, and presently made a trial\nof what he intended, by asking great things of him; for some made a clamor\nthat he would ease them in their taxes; others, that he would take off\nthe duties upon commodities; and some, that he would loose those that were\nin prison; in all which cases he answered readily to their satisfaction,\nin order to get the good-will of the multitude; after which he offered\n[the proper] sacrifices, and feasted with his friends. And here it was\nthat a great many of those that desired innovations came in crowds towards\nthe evening, and began then to mourn on their own account, when the public\nmourning for the king was over. These lamented those that were put to death\nby Herod, because they had cut down the golden eagle that had been over\nthe gate of the temple. Nor was this mourning of a private nature, but\nthe lamentations were very great, the mourning solemn, and the weeping\nsuch as was loudly heard all over the city, as being for those men who\nhad perished for the laws of their country, and for the temple. They cried\nout that a punishment ought to be inflicted for these men upon those that\nwere honored by Herod; and that, in the first place, the man whom he had\nmade high priest should be deprived; and that it was fit to choose a person\nof greater piety and purity than he was.", "At these clamors Archelaus was provoked, but restrained himself from\ntaking vengeance on the authors, on account of the haste he was in of going\nto Rome, as fearing lest, upon his making war on the multitude, such an\naction might detain him at home. Accordingly, he made trial to quiet the\ninnovators by persuasion, rather than by force, and sent his general in\na private way to them, and by him exhorted them to be quiet. But the seditious\nthrew stones at him, and drove him away, as he came into the temple, and\nbefore he could say any thing to them. The like treatment they showed to\nothers, who came to them after him, many of which were sent by Archelaus,\nin order to reduce them to sobriety, and these answered still on all occasions\nafter a passionate manner; and it openly appeared that they would not be\nquiet, if their numbers were but considerable. And indeed, at the feast\nof unleavened bread, which was now at hand, and is by the Jews called the\nPassover, and used to he celebrated with a great number of sacrifices,\nan innumerable multitude of the people came out of the country to worship;\nsome of these stood in the temple bewailing the Rabbins [that had been\nput to death], and procured their sustenance by begging, in order to support\ntheir sedition. At this Archclaus was aftrighted, and privately sent a\ntribune, with his cohort of soldiers, upon them, before the disease should\nspread over the whole multitude, and gave orders that they should constrain\nthose that began the tumult, by force, to be quiet. At these the whole\nmultitude were irritated, and threw stones at many of the soldiers, and\nkilled them; but the tribune fled away wounded, and had much ado to escape\nso. After which they betook themselves to their sacrifices, as if they\nhad done no mischief; nor did it appear to Archelaus that the multitude\ncould be restrained without bloodshed; so he sent his whole army upon them,\nthe footmen in great multitudes, by the way of the city, and the horsemen\nby the way of the plain, who, falling upon them on the sudden, as they\nwere offering their sacrifices, destroyed about three thousand of them;\nbut the rest of the multitude were dispersed upon the adjoining mountains:\nthese were followed by Archelaus's heralds, who commanded every one to\nretire to their own homes, whither they all went, and left the festival.", "ARCHELAUS went down now to the sea-side, with his mother and his\nfriends, Poplas, and Ptolemy, and Nicolaus, and left behind him Philip,\nto be his steward in the palace, and to take care of his domestic affairs.\nSalome went also along with him with her sons, as did also the king's brethren\nand sons-in-law. These, in appearance, went to give him all the assistance\nthey were able, in order to secure his succession, but in reality to accuse\nhim for his breach of the laws by what he had done at the temple.", "But as they were come to Cesarea, Sabinus, the procurator of Syria,\nmet them; he was going up to Judea, to secure Herod's effects; but Varus,\n[president of Syria,] who was come thither, restrained him from going any\nfarther. This Varus Archelaus had sent for, by the earnest entreaty of\nPtolemy. At this time, indeed, Sabinus, to gratify Varus, neither went\nto the citadels, nor did he shut up the treasuries where his father's money\nwas laid up, but promised that he would lie still, until Caesar should\nhave taken cognizance of the affair. So he abode at Cesarea; but as soon\nas those that were his hinderance were gone, when Varus was gone to Antioch,\nand Archclaus was sailed to Rome, he immediately went on to Jerusalem,\nand seized upon the palace. And when he had called for the governors of\nthe citadels, and the stewards [of the king's private affairs], he tried\nto sift out the accounts of the money, and to take possession of the citadels.\nBut the governors of those citadels were not unmindful of the commands\nlaid upon them by Archelaus, and continued to guard them, and said the\ncustody of them rather belonged to Caesar than to Archelaus.", "In the mean time, Antipas went also to Rome, to strive for the kingdom,\nand to insist that the former testament, wherein he was named to be king,\nwas valid before the latter testament. Salome had also promised to assist\nhim, as had many of Archelaus's kindred, who sailed along with Archelaus\nhimself also. He also carried along with him his mother, and Ptolemy, the\nbrother of Nicolaus, who seemed one of great weight, on account of the\ngreat trust Herod put in him, he having been one of his most honored friends.\nHowever, Antipas depended chiefly upon Ireneus, the orator; upon whose\nauthority he had rejected such as advised him to yield to Archelaus, because\nhe was his elder brother, and because the second testament gave the kingdom\nto him. The inclinations also of all Archelaus's kindred, who hated him,\nwere removed to Antipas, when they came to Rome; although in the first\nplace every one rather desired to live under their own laws [without a\nking], and to be under a Roman governor; but if they should fail in that\npoint, these desired that Antipas might be their king.", "Sabinus did also afford these his assistance to the same purpose\nby letters he sent, wherein he accused Archelaus before Caesar, and highly\ncommended Antipas. Salome also, and those with her, put the crimes which\nthey accused Archelaus of in order, and put them into Caesar's hands; and\nafter they had done that, Archelaus wrote down the reasons of his claim,\nand, by Ptolemy, sent in his father's ring, and his father's accounts.\nAnd when Caesar had maturely weighed by himself what both had to allege\nfor themselves, as also had considered of the great burden of the kingdom,\nand largeness of the revenues, and withal the number of the children Herod\nhad left behind him, and had moreover read the letters he had received\nfrom Varus and Sabinus on this occasion, he assembled the principal persons\namong the Romans together, (in which assembly Caius, the son of Agrippa,\nand his daughter Julias, but by himself adopted for his own son, sat in\nthe first seat,) and gave the pleaders leave to speak.", "Then stood up Salome's son, Antipater, (who of all Archelaus's antagonists\nwas the shrewdest pleader,) and accused him in the following speech: That\nArchelaus did in words contend for the kingdom, but that in deeds he had\nlong exercised royal authority, and so did but insult Caesar in desiring\nto be now heard on that account, since he had not staid for his determination\nabout the succession, and since he had suborned certain persons, after\nHerod's death, to move for putting the diadem upon his head; since he had\nset himself down in the throne, and given answers as a king, and altered\nthe disposition of the army, and granted to some higher dignities; that\nhe had also complied in all things with the people in the requests they\nhad made to him as to their king, and had also dismissed those that had\nbeen put into bonds by his father for most important reasons. Now, after\nall this, he desires the shadow of that royal authority, whose substance\nhe had already seized to himself, and so hath made Caesar lord, not of\nthings, but of words. He also reproached him further, that his mourning\nfor his father was only pretended, while he put on a sad countenance in\nthe day time, but drank to great excess in the night; from which behavior,\nhe said, the late disturbance among the multitude came, while they had\nan indignation thereat. And indeed the purport of his whole discourse was\nto aggravate Archelaus's crime in slaying such a multitude about the temple,\nwhich multitude came to the festival, but were barbarously slain in the\nmidst of their own sacrifices; and he said there was such a vast number\nof dead bodies heaped together in the temple, as even a foreign war, that\nshould come upon them [suddenly], before it was denounced, could not have\nheaped together. And he added, that it was the foresight his father had\nof that his barbarity which made him never give him any hopes of the kingdom,\nbut when his mind was more infirm than his body, and he was not able to\nreason soundly, and did not well know what was the character of that son,\nwhom in his second testament he made his successor; and this was done by\nhim at a time when he had no complaints to make of him whom he had named\nbefore, when he was sound in body, and when his mind was free from all\npassion. That, however, if any one should suppose Herod's judgment, when\nhe was sick, was superior to that at another time, yet had Archelaus forfeited\nhis kingdom by his own behavior, and those his actions, which were contrary\nto the law, and to its disadvantage. Or what sort of a king will this man\nbe, when he hath obtained the government from Caesar, who hath slain so\nmany before he hath obtained it!", "When Antipater had spoken largely to this purpose, and had produced\na great number of Archelaus's kindred as witnesses, to prove every part\nof the accusation, he ended his discourse. Then stood up Nicolaus to plead\nfor Archelaus. He alleged that the slaughter in the temple could not be\navoided; that those that were slain were become enemies not to Archelaus's\nkingdom, only, but to Caesar, who was to determine about him. He also demonstrated\nthat Archelaus's accusers had advised him to perpetrate other things of\nwhich he might have been accused. But he insisted that the latter testament\nshould, for this reason, above all others, be esteemed valid, because Herod\nhad therein appointed Caesar to be the person who should confirm the succession;\nfor he who showed such prudence as to recede from his own power, and yield\nit up to the lord of the world, cannot be supposed mistaken in his judgment\nabout him that was to be his heir; and he that so well knew whom to choose\nfor arbitrator of the succession could not be unacquainted with him whom\nhe chose for his successor.", "When Nicolaus had gone through all he had to say, Archelaus came,\nand fell down before Caesar's knees, without any noise; - upon which he\nraised him up, after a very obliging manner, and declared that truly he\nwas worthy to succeed his father. However, he still made no firm determination\nin his case; but when he had dismissed those assessors that had been with\nhim that day, he deliberated by himself about the allegations which he\nhad heard, whether it were fit to constitute any of those named in the\ntestaments for Herod's successor, or whether the government should be parted\namong all his posterity, and this because of the number of those that seemed\nto stand in need of support therefrom.", "NOW before Caesar had determined any thing about these affairs, Malthace,\nArehelaus's mother, fell sick and died. Letters also were brought out of\nSyria from Varus, about a revolt of the Jews. This was foreseen by Varus,\nwho accordingly, after Archelaus was sailed, went up to Jerusalem to restrain\nthe promoters of the sedition, since it was manifest that the nation would\nnot he at rest; so he left one of those legions which he brought with him\nout of Syria in the city, and went himself to Antioch. But Sabinus came,\nafter he was gone, and gave them an occasion of making innovations; for\nhe compelled the keepers of the citadels to deliver them up to him, and\nmade a bitter search after the king's money, as depending not only on the\nsoldiers which were left by Varus, but on the multitude of his own servants,\nall which he armed and used as the instruments of his covetousness. Now\nwhen that feast, which was observed after seven weeks, and which the Jews\ncalled Pentecost, (i. e. the 50th day,) was at hand, its name being taken\nfrom the number of the days [after the passover], the people got together,\nbut not on account of the accustomed Divine worship, but of the indignation\nthey had ['at the present state of affairs']. Wherefore an immense multitude\nran together, out of Galilee, and Idumea, and Jericho, and Perea, that\nwas beyond Jordan; but the people that naturally belonged to Judea itself\nwere above the rest, both in number, and in the alacrity of the men. So\nthey distributed themselves into three parts, and pitched their camps in\nthree places; one at the north side of the temple, another at the south\nside, by the Hippodrome, and the third part were at the palace on the west.\nSo they lay round about the Romans on every side, and besieged them.", "Now Sabinus was aftrighted, both at their multitude, and at their\ncourage, and sent messengers to Varus continually, and besought him to\ncome to his succor quickly; for that if he delayed, his legion would be\ncut to pieces. As for Sabinus himself, he got up to the highest tower of\nthe fortress, which was called Phasaelus; it is of the same name with Herod's\nbrother, who was destroyed by the Parthians; and then he made signs to\nthe soldiers of that legion to attack the enemy; for his astonishment was\nso great, that he durst not go down to his own men. Hereupon the soldiers\nwere prevailed upon, and leaped out into the temple, and fought a terrible\nbattle with the Jews; in which, while there were none over their heads\nto distress them, they were too hard for them, by their skill, and the\nothers' want of skill, in war; but when once many of the Jews had gotten\nup to the top of the cloisters, and threw their darts downwards, upon the\nheads of the Romans, there were a great many of them destroyed. Nor was\nit easy to avenge themselves upon those that threw their weapons from on\nhigh, nor was it more easy for them to sustain those who came to fight\nthem hand to hand.", "Since therefore the Romans were sorely afflicted by both these circumstances,\nthey set fire to the cloisters, which were works to be admired, both on\naccount of their magnitude and costliness. Whereupon those that were above\nthem were presently encompassed with the flame, and many of them perished\ntherein; as many of them also were destroyed by the enemy, who came suddenly\nupon them; some of them also threw themselves down from the walls backward,\nand some there were who, from the desperate condition they were in, prevented\nthe fire, by killing themselves with their own swords; but so many of them\nas crept out from the walls, and came upon the Romans, were easily mastere\nby them, by reason of the astonishment they were under; until at last some\nof the Jews being destroyed, and others dispersed by the terror they were\nin, the soldiers fell upon the treasure of God, which w now deserted, and\nplundered about four hundred talents, Of which sum Sabinus got together\nall that was not carried away by the soldiers.", "However, this destruction of the works [about the temple], and of\nthe men, occasioned a much greater number, and those of a more warlike\nsort, to get together, to oppose the Romans. These encompassed the palace\nround, and threatened to deploy all that were in it, unless they went their\nways quickly; for they promised that Sabinus should come to no harm, if\nhe would go out with his legion. There were also a great many of the king's\nparty who deserted the Romans, and assisted the Jews; yet did the most\nwarlike body of them all, who were three thousand of the men of Sebaste,\ngo over to the Romans. Rufus also, and Gratus, their captains, did the\nsame, (Gratus having the foot of the king's party under him, and Rufus\nthe horse,) each of whom, even without the forces under them, were of great\nweight, on account of their strength and wisdom, which turn the scales\nin war. Now the Jews in the siege, and tried to break down walls of the\nfortress, and cried out to Sabinus and his party, that they should go their\nways, and not prove a hinderance to them, now they hoped, after a long\ntime, to recover that ancient liberty which their forefathers had enjoyed.\nSabinus indeed was well contented to get out of the danger he was in, but\nhe distrusted the assurances the Jews gave him, and suspected such gentle\ntreatment was but a bait laid as a snare for them: this consideration,\ntogether with the hopes he had of succor from Varus, made him bear the\nsiege still longer.", "AT this time there were great disturbances in the country, and that\nin many places; and the opportunity that now offered itself induced a great\nmany to set up for kings. And indeed in Idumea two thousand of Herod's\nveteran soldiers got together, and armed and fought against those of the\nking's party; against whom Achiabus, the king's first cousin, fought, and\nthat out of some of the places that were the most strongly fortified; but\nso as to avoid a direct conflict with them in the plains. In Sepphoris\nalso, a city of Galilee, there was one Judas (the son of that arch-robber\nHezekias, who formerly overran the country, and had been subdued by king\nHerod); this man got no small multitude together, and brake open the place\nwhere the royal armor was laid up, and armed those about him, and attacked\nthose that were so earnest to gain the dominion.", "In Perea also, Simon, one of the servants to the king, relying upon\nthe handsome appearance and tallness of his body, put a diadem upon his\nown head also; he also went about with a company of robbers that he had\ngotten together, and burnt down the royal palace that was at Jericho, and\nmany other costly edifices besides, and procured himself very easily spoils\nby rapine, as snatching them out of the fire. And he had soon burnt down\nall the fine edifices, if Gratus, the captain of the foot of the king's\nparty, had not taken the Trachonite archers, and the most warlike of Sebaste,\nand met the man. His footmen were slain in the battle in abundance; Gratus\nalso cut to pieces Simon himself, as he was flying along a strait valley,\nwhen he gave him an oblique stroke upon his neck, as he ran away, and brake\nit. The royal palaces that were near Jordan at Betharamptha were also burnt\ndown by some other of the seditious that came out of Perea.", "At this time it was that a certain shepherd ventured to set himself\nup for a king; he was called Athrongeus. It was his strength of body that\nmade him expect such a dignity, as well as his soul, which despised death;\nand besides these qualifications, he had four brethren like himself. He\nput a troop of armed men under each of these his brethren, and made use\nof them as his generals and commanders, when he made his incursions, while\nhe did himself act like a king, and meddled only with the more important\naffairs; and at this time he put a diadem about his head, and continued\nafter that to overrun the country for no little time with his brethren,\nand became their leader in killing both the Romans and those of the king's\nparty; nor did any Jew escape him, if any gain could accrue to him thereby.\nHe once ventured to encompass a whole troop of Romans at Emmaus, who were\ncarrying corn and weapons to their legion; his men therefore shot their\narrows and darts, and thereby slew their centurion Arius, and forty of\nthe stoutest of his men, while the rest of them, who were in danger of\nthe same fate, upon the coming of Gratus, with those of Sebaste, to their\nassistance, escaped. And when these men had thus served both their own\ncountrymen and foreigners, and that through this whole war, three of them\nwere, after some time, subdued; the eldest by Archelaus, the two next by\nfalling into the hands of Gratus and Ptolemeus; but the fourth delivered\nhimself up to Archelaus, upon his giving him his right hand for his security.\nHowever, this their end was not till afterward, while at present they filled\nall Judea with a piratic war.", "UPON Varus's reception of the letters that were written by Sabinus\nand the captains, he could not avoid being afraid for the whole legion\n[he had left there]. So he made haste to their relief, and took with him\nthe other two legions, with the four troops of horsemen to them belonging,\nand marched to Ptolenlais; having given orders for the auxiliaries that\nwere sent by the kings and governors of cities to meet him there. Moreover,\nhe received from the people of Berytus, as he passed through their city,\nfifteen hundred armed men. Now as soon as the other body of auxiliaries\nwere come to Ptolemais, as well as Aretas the Arabian, (who, out of the\nhatred he bore to Herod, brought a great army of horse and foot,) Varus\nsent a part of his army presently to Galilee, which lay near to Ptolemais,\nand Caius, one of his friends, for their captain. This Caius put those\nthat met him to flight, and took the city Sepphoris, and burnt it, and\nmade slaves of its inhabitants; but as for Varus himself, he marched to\nSamaria with his whole army, where he did not meddle with the city itself,\nbecause he found that it had made no commotion during these troubles, but\npitched his camp about a certain village which was called Aras. It belonged\nto Ptolemy, and on that account was plundered by the Arabians, who were\nvery angry even at Herod's friends also. He thence marched on to the village\nSampho, another fortified place, which they plundered, as they had done\nthe other. As they carried off all the money they lighted upon belonging\nto the public revenues, all was now full of fire and blood-shed, and nothing\ncould resist the plunders of the Arabians. Emnaus was also burnt, upon\nthe flight of its inhabitants, and this at the command of Varus, out of\nhis rage at the slaughter of those that were about Arias.", "Thence he marched on to Jerusalem, and as soon as he was but seen\nby the Jews, he made their camps disperse themselves; they also went away,\nand fled up and down the country. But the citizens received him, and cleared\nthemselves of having any hand in this revolt, and said that they had raised\nno commotions, but had only been forced to admit the multitude, because\nof the festival, and that they were rather besieged together with the Romans,\nthan assisted those that had revolted. There had before this met him Joseph,\nthe first cousin of Archelaus, and Gratus, together with Rufus, who led\nthose of Sebaste, as well as the king's army: there also met him those\nof the Roman legion, armed after their accustomed manner; for as to Sabinus,\nhe durst not come into Varus's sight, but was gone out of the city before\nthis, to the sea-side. But Varus sent a part of his army into the country,\nagainst those that had been the authors of this commotion, and as they\ncaught great numbers of them, those that appeared to have been the least\nconcerned in these tumults he put into custody, but such as were the most\nguilty he crucified; these were in number about two thousand.", "He was also informed that there continued in Idumea ten thousand\nmen still in arms; but when he found that the Arabians did not act like\nauxiliaries, but managed the war according to their own passions, and did\nmischief to the country otherwise than he intended, and this out of their\nhatred to Herod, he sent them away, but made haste, with his own legions,\nto march against those that had revolted; but these, by the advice of Achiabus,\ndelivered themselves up to him before it came to a battle. Then did Varus\nforgive the multitude their offenses, but sent their captains to Caesar\nto be examined by him. Now Caesar forgave the rest, but gave orders that\ncertain of the king's relations (for some of those that were among them\nwere Herod's kinsmen) should be put to death, because they had engaged\nin a war against a king of their own family.

And when\nCaesar had assembled a council of the principal Romans in Apollo's \ntemple, that was in the palace, (this was what he had himself built and\nadorned, at a vast expense,) the multitude of the Jews stood with the ambassadors,\nand on the other side stood Archelaus, with his friends; but as for the\nkindred of Archelaus, they stood on neither side; for to stand on Archelaus's\nside, their hatred to him, and envy at him, would not give them leave,\nwhile yet they were afraid to be seen by Caesar with his accusers. Besides\nthese, there were present Archelaus's brother Philip, being sent thither\nbeforehand, out of kindness by Varus, for two reasons: the one was this,\nthat he might be assisting to Archelaus; and the other was this, that in\ncase Caesar should make a distribution of what Herod possessed among his\nposterity, he might obtain some share of it."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Here\nwe have a strong confirmation that it was Xerxes, and not Artaxerxes, under\nwhom the main part of the Jews returned out of the Babylonian captivity,\ni.e. in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah.

Whereupon\nthey prayed that the Romans would have compassion upon the [poor] remains\nof Judea, and not expose what was left of them to such as barbarously tore\nthem to pieces, and that they would join their country to Syria, and administer\nthe government by their own commanders, whereby it would [soon] be demonstrated\nthat those who are now under the calumny of seditious persons, and lovers\nof war, know how to bear governors that are set over them, if they be but\ntolerable ones. So the Jews concluded their accusation with this request.\nThen rose up Nicolaus, and confuted the accusations which were brought\nagainst the kings, and himself accused the Jewish nation, as hard to be\nruled, and as naturally disobedient to kings. He also reproached all those\nkinsmen of Archelaus who had left him, and were gone over to his accusers."}, "So Caesar, after he had heard both sides, dissolved the assembly\nfor that time; but a few days afterward, he gave the one half of Herod's\nkingdom to Archelaus, by the name of Ethnarch, and promised to make him\nking also afterward, if he rendered himself worthy of that dignity. But\nas to the other half, he divided it into two tetrarchies, and gave them\nto two other sons of Herod, the one of them to Philip, and the other to\nthat Antipas who contested the kingdom with Archelaus. Under this last\nwas Perea and Galilee, with a revenue of two hundred talents; but Batanea,\nand Trachonitis, and Auranitis, and certain parts of Zeno's house about\nJamnia, with a revenue of a hundred talents, were made subject to Philip;\nwhile Idumea, and all Judea, and Samaria were parts of the ethnarchy of\nArchelaus, although Samaria was eased of one quarter of its taxes, out\nof regard to their not having revolted with the rest of the nation. He\nalso made subject to him the following cities, viz. Strato's Tower, and\nSebaste, and Joppa, and Jerusalem; but as to the Grecian cities, Gaza,\nand Gadara, and Hippos, he cut them off from the kingdom, and added them\nto Syria. Now the revenue of the country that was given to Archelaus was\nfour hundred talents. Salome also, besides what the king had left her in\nhis testaments, was now made mistress of Jamnia, and Ashdod, and Phasaelis.\nCaesar did moreover bestow upon her the royal palace of Ascalon; by all\nwhich she got together a revenue of sixty talents; but he put her house\nunder the ethnarchy of Archelaus. And for the rest of Herod's offspring,\nthey received what was bequeathed to them in his testaments; but, besides\nthat, Caesar granted to Herod's two virgin daughters five hundred thousand\n[drachmae] of silver, and gave them in marriage to the sons of Pheroras:\nbut after this family distribution, he gave between them what had been\nbequeathed to him by Herod, which was a thousand talents, reserving to\nhimself only some inconsiderable presents, in honor of the deceased.", "In the meantime, there was a man, who was by birth a Jew, but brought\nup at Sidon with one of the Roman freed-men, who falsely pretended, on\naccount of the resemblance of their countenances, that he was that Alexander\nwho was slain by Herod. This man came to Rome, in hopes of not being detected.\nHe had one who was his assistant, of his own nation, and who knew all the\naffairs of the kingdom, and instructed him to say how those that were sent\nto kill him and Aristobulus had pity upon them, and stole them away, by\nputting bodies that were like theirs in their places. This man deceived\nthe Jews that were at Crete, and got a great deal of money of them for\ntraveling in splendor; and thence sailed to Melos, where he was thought\nso certainly genuine, that he got a great deal more money, and prevailed\nwith those that had treated him to sail along with him to Rome. So he landed\nat Dicearchia, [Puteoli,] and got very large presents from the Jews who\ndwelt there, and was conducted by his father's friends as if he were a\nking; nay, the resemblance in his countenance procured him so much credit,\nthat those who had seen Alexander, and had known him very well, would take\ntheir oaths that he was the very same person. Accordingly, the whole body\nof the Jews that were at Rome ran out in crowds to see him, and an innumerable\nmultitude there was which stood in the narrow places through which he was\ncarried; for those of Melos were so far distracted, that they carried him\nin a sedan, and maintained a royal attendance for him at their own proper\ncharges.", "But Caesar, who knew perfectly well the lineaments of Alexander's\nface, because he had been accused by Herod before him, discerned the fallacy\nin his countenance, even before he saw the man. However, he suffered the\nagreeable fame that went of him to have some weight with him, and sent\nCeladus, one who well knew Alexander, and ordered him to bring the young\nman to him. But when Caesar saw him, he immediately discerned a difference\nin his countenance; and when he had discovered that his whole body was\nof a more robust texture, and like that of a slave, he understood the whole\nwas a contrivance. But the impudence of what he said greatly provoked him\nto be angry at him; for when he was asked about Aristobulus, he said that\nhe was also preserved alive, and was left on purpose in Cyprus, for fear\nof treachery, because it would be harder for plotters to get them both\ninto their power while they were separate. Then did Caesar take him by\nhimself privately, and said to him, \"I will give thee thy life, if\nthou wilt discover who it was that persuaded thee to forge such stories.\"\nSo he said that he would discover him, and followed Caesar, and pointed\nto that Jew who abused the resemblance of his face to get money; for that\nhe had received more presents in every city than ever Alexander did when\nhe was alive. Caesar laughed at the contrivance, and put this spurious\nAlexander among his rowers, on account of the strength of his body, but\nordered him that persuaded him to be put to death. But for the people of\nMelos, they had been sufficiently punished for their folly, by the expenses\nthey had been at on his account.", "And now Archelaus took possession of his ethnarchy, and used not\nthe Jews only, but the Samaritans also, barbarously; and this out of his\nresentment of their old quarrels with him. Whereupon they both of them\nsent ambassadors against him to Caesar; and in the ninth year of his government\nhe was banished to Vienna, a city of Gaul, and his effects were put into\nCaesar's treasury. But the report goes, that before he was sent for by\nCaesar, he seemed to see nine ears of corn, full and large, but devoured\nby oxen. When, therefore, he had sent for the diviners, and some of the\nChaldeans, and inquired of them what they thought it portended; and when\none of them had one interpretation, and another had another, Simon, one\nof the sect of Essens, said that he thought the ears of corn denoted years,\nand the oxen denoted a mutation of things, because by their ploughing they\nmade an alteration of the country. That therefore he should reign as many\nyears as there were ears of corn; and after he had passed through various\nalterations of fortune, should die. Now five days after Archelaus had heard\nthis interpretation he was called to his trial.", "I cannot also but think it worthy to be recorded what dream Glaphyra,\nthe daughter of Archelaus, king of Cappadocia, had, who had at first been\nwife to Alexander, who was the brother of Archelaus, concerning whom we\nhave been discoursing. This Alexander was the son of Herod the king, by\nwhom he was put to death, as we have already related. This Glaphyra was\nmarried, after his death, to Juba, king of Libya; and, after his death,\nwas returned home, and lived a widow with her father. Then it was that\nArchelaus, the ethnarch, saw her, and fell so deeply in love with her,\nthat he divorced Mariamne, who was then his wife, ,and married her. When,\ntherefore, she was come into Judea, and had been there for a little while,\nshe thought she saw Alexander stand by her, and that he said to her; \"Thy\nmarriage with the king of Libya might have been sufficient for thee; but\nthou wast not contented with him, but art returned again to my family,\nto a third husband; and him, thou impudent woman, hast thou chosen for\nthine husband, who is my brother. However, I shall not overlook the injury\nthou hast offered me; I shall [soon] have thee again, whether thou wilt\nor no.\" Now Glaphyra hardly survived the narration of this dream of\nhers two days.", "AND now Archelaus's part of Judea was reduced into a province, and\nCoponius, one of the equestrian order among the Romans, was sent as a procurator,\nhaving the power of [life and] death put into his hands by Caesar. Under\nhis administration it was that a certain Galilean, whose name was Judas,\nprevailed with his countrymen to revolt, and said they were cowards if\nthey would endure to pay a tax to the Romans and would after God submit\nto mortal men as their lords. This man was a teacher of a peculiar sect\nof his own, and was not at all like the rest of those their leaders.", "For there are three philosophical sects among the Jews. The followers\nof the first of which are the Pharisees; of the second, the Sadducees;\nand the third sect, which pretends to a severer discipline, are called\nEssens. These last are Jews by birth, and seem to have a greater affection\nfor one another than the other sects have. These Essens reject pleasures\nas an evil, but esteem continence, and the conquest over our passions,\nto be virtue. They neglect wedlock, but choose out other persons children,\nwhile they are pliable, and fit for learning, and esteem them to be of\ntheir kindred, and form them according to their own manners. They do not\nabsolutely deny the fitness of marriage, and the succession of mankind\nthereby continued; but they guard against the lascivious behavior of women,\nand are persuaded that none of them preserve their fidelity to one man.", "These men are despisers of riches, and so very communicative as raises\nour admiration.

They think\nthat oil is a defilement; and if any one of them be anointed without his\nown approbation, it is wiped off his body; for they think to be sweaty\nis a good thing, as they do also to be clothed in white garments. They\nalso have stewards appointed to take care of their common affairs, who\nevery one of them have no separate business for any, but what is for the\nuses of them all.", "They have no one certain city, but many of them dwell in every city;\nand if any of their sect come from other places, what they have lies open\nfor them, just as if it were their own; and they go in to such as they\nnever knew before, as if they had been ever so long acquainted with them.\nFor which reason they carry nothing at all with them when they travel into\nremote parts, though still they take their weapons with them, for fear\nof thieves. Accordingly, there is, in every city where they live, one appointed\nparticularly to take care of strangers, and to provide garments and other\nnecessaries for them. But the habit and management of their bodies is such\nas children use who are in fear of their masters. Nor do they allow of\nthe change of or of shoes till be first torn to pieces, or worn out by\ntime. Nor do they either buy or sell any thing to one another; but every\none of them gives what he hath to him that wanteth it, and receives from\nhim again in lieu of it what may be convenient for himself; and although\nthere be no requital made, they are fully allowed to take what they want\nof whomsoever they please.", "And as for their piety towards God, it is very extraordinary; for\nbefore sun-rising they speak not a word about profane matters, but put\nup certain prayers which they have received from their forefathers, as\nif they made a supplication for its rising. After this every one of them\nare sent away by their curators, to exercise some of those arts wherein\nthey are skilled, in which they labor with great diligence till the fifth\nhour.

The same priest, when he hath dined,\nsays grace again after meat; and when they begin, and when they end, they\npraise God, as he that bestows their food upon them; after which they lay\naside their [white] garments, and betake themselves to their labors again\ntill the evening; then they return home to supper, after the same manner;\nand if there be any strangers there, they sit down with them. Nor is there\never any clamor or disturbance to pollute their house, but they give every\none leave to speak in their turn; which silence thus kept in their house\nappears to foreigners like some tremendous mystery; the cause of which\nis that perpetual sobriety they exercise, and the same settled measure\nof meat and drink that is allotted them, and that such as is abundantly\nsufficient for them.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This\npractice of the Essens, in refusing to swear, and esteeming swearing in\nordinary occasions worse than perjury, is delivered here in general words,\nas are the parallel injunctions of our Savior, Matthew 6:34; 23:16; and\nof St. James, 5:12; but all admit of particular exceptions for solemn causes,\nand on great and necessary occasions.

He added further, that he would\nadminister the government as a good prince, and not like a tyrant; for\nthat he would be satisfied with the honor of being called emperor, but\nwould, in every one of his actions, permit them all to give him their advice;\nfor that although he had not been by nature for moderation, yet would the\ndeath of Caius afford him a sufficient demonstration how soberly he ought\nto act in that station.", "This message was delivered by Agrippa; to which the senate replied,\nthat since they had an army, and the wisest counsels on their side, they\nwould not endure a voluntary slavery. And when Claudius heard what answer\nthe senate had made, he sent Agrippa to them again, with the following\nmessage: That he could not bear the thoughts of betraying them that had\ngiven their oaths to be true to him; and that he saw he must fight, though\nunwillingly, against such as he had no mind to fight; that, however, [if\nit must come to that,] it was proper to choose a place without the city\nfor the war, because it was not agreeable to piety to pollute the temples\nof their own city with the blood of their own countrymen, and this only\non occasion of their imprudent conduct.

Upon which all the patricians\nwere immediately in a great fright at their being thus deserted. But still,\nbecause there appeared no other way whither they could turn themselves\nfor deliverance, they made haste the same way with the soldiers, and went\nto Claudius. But those that had the greatest luck in flattering the good\nfortune of Claudius betimes met them before the walls with their naked\nswords, and there was reason to fear that those that came first might have\nbeen in danger, before Claudius could know what violence the soldiers were\ngoing to offer them, had not Agrippa ran before, and told him what a dangerous\nthing they were going about, and that unless he restrained the violence\nof these men, who were in a fit of madness against the patricians, he would\nlose those on whose account it was most desirable to rule, and would be\nemperor over a desert.", "When Claudius heard this, he restrained the violence of the soldiery,\nand received the senate into the camp, and treated them after an obliging\nmanner, and went out with them presently to offer their thank-offerings\nto God, which were proper upon, his first coming to the empire. Moreover,\nhe bestowed on Agrippa his whole paternal kingdom immediately, and added\nto it, besides those countries that had been given by Augustus to Herod,\nTrachonitis and Auranitis, and still besides these, that kingdom which\nwas called the kingdom of Lysanius. This gift he declared to the people\nby a decree, but ordered the magistrates to have the donation engraved\non tables of brass, and to be set up in the capitol. He bestowed on his\nbrother Herod, who was also his son-in-law, by marrying [his daughter]\nBernice, the kingdom of Chalcis.", "So now riches flowed in to Agrippa by his enjoyment of so large a\ndominion; nor did he abuse the money he had on small matters, but he began\nto encompass Jerusalem with such a wall, which, had it been brought to\nperfection, had made it impracticable for the Romans to take it by siege;\nbut his death, which happened at Cesarea, before he had raised the walls\nto their due height, prevented him.

On which account both parties had a contest with one another; and\nthis contest increased so much, that it came at last to arms, and the bolder\nsort of them marched out to fight; for the elders of the Jews were not\nable to put a stop to their own people that were disposed to be tumultuous,\nand the Greeks thought it a shame for them to be overcome by the Jews.\nNow these Jews exceeded the others in riches and strength of body; but\nthe Grecian part had the advantage of assistance from the soldiery; for\nthe greatest part of the Roman garrison was raised out of Syria; and being\nthus related to the Syrian part, they were ready to assist it. However,\nthe governors of the city were concerned to keep all quiet, and whenever\nthey caught those that were most for fighting on either side, they punished\nthem with stripes and bands. Yet did not the sufferings of those that were\ncaught affright the remainder, or make them desist; but they were still\nmore and more exasperated, and deeper engaged in the sedition. And as Felix\ncame once into the market-place, and commanded the Jews, when they had\nbeaten the Syrians, to go their ways, and threatened them if they would\nnot, and they would not obey him, he sent his soldiers out upon them, and\nslew a great many of them, upon which it fell out that what they had was\nplundered.

Accordingly, he did not only, in his\npolitical capacity, steal and plunder every one's substance, nor did he\nonly burden the whole nation with taxes, but he permitted the relations\nof such as were in prison for robbery, and had been laid there, either\nby the senate of every city, or by the former procurators, to redeem them\nfor money; and no body remained in the prisons as a malefactor but he who\ngave him nothing.

The\neffect of which was this, that those who lost their goods were forced to\nhold their peace, when they had reason to show great indignation at what\nthey had suffered; but those who had escaped were forced to flatter him\nthat deserved to be punished, out of the fear they were in of suffering\nequally with the others.

Whereupon the warmer part of the Jewish youth went hastily to\nthe workmen, and forbade them to build there; but as Florus would not permit\nthem to use force, the great men of the Jews, with John the publican, being\nin the utmost distress what to do, persuaded Florus, with the offer of\neight talents, to hinder the work. He then, being intent upon nothing but\ngetting money, promised he would do for them all they desired of him, and\nthen went away from Cesarea to Sebaste, and left the sedition to take its\nfull course, as if he had sold a license to the Jews to fight it out.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Take here Dr. Hudson's very pertinent note. \"By this action,\"\nsays he, \"the killing of a bird over an earthen vessel, the Jews were\nexposed as a leprous people; for that was to be done by the law in the\ncleansing of a leper, Leviticus 14.

Hereupon Jucundus, the master of the horse, who was ordered\nto prevent the fight, came thither, and took away the earthen vessel, and\nendeavored to put a stop to the sedition; but when \nhe was overcome by the violence of the people of Cesarea, the Jews caught\nup their books of the law, and retired to Narbata, which was a place to\nthem belonging, distant from Cesarea sixty furlongs.

The soldiers\ntherefore encompassed them presently, and struck them with their clubs;\nand as they fled away, the horsemen trampled them down, so that a great\nmany fell down dead by the strokes of the Romans, and more by their own\nviolence in crushing one another. Now there was a terrible crowding about\nthe gates, and while every body was making haste to get before another,\nthe flight of them all was retarded, and a terrible destruction there was\namong those that fell down, for they were suffocated, an broken to pieces\nby the multitude of those that were uppermost; nor could any of them be\ndistinguished by his relations in order to the care of his funeral; the\nsoldiers also who beat them, fell upon those whom they overtook, without\nshowing them any mercy, and thrust the multitude through the place called\nBezetha, \nas they forced their way, in order to get in and seize upon the temple,\nand the tower Antonia. Florus also being desirous to get those places into\nhis possession, brought such as were with him out of the king's palace,\nand would have compelled them to get as far as the citadel [Antonia;] but\nhis attempt failed, for the people immediately turned back upon him, and\nstopped the violence of his attempt; and as they stood upon the tops of\ntheir houses, they threw their darts at the Romans, who, as they were sorely\ngalled thereby, because those weapons came from above, and they were not\nable to make a passage through the multitude, which stopped up the narrow\npassages, they retired to the camp which was at the palace."}, "But for the seditious, they were afraid lest Florus should come again,\nand get possession of the temple, through Antonia; so they got immediately\nupon those cloisters of the temple that joined to Antonia, and cut them\ndown. This cooled the avarice of Florus; for whereas he was eager to obtain\nthe treasures of God [in the temple], and on that account was desirous\nof getting into Antonia, as soon as the cloisters were broken down, he\nleft off his attempt; he then sent for the high priests and the sanhedrim,\nand told them that he was indeed himself going out of the city, but that\nhe would leave them as large a garrison as they should desire. Hereupon\nthey promised that they would make no innovations, in case he would leave\nthem one band; but not that which had fought with the Jews, because the\nmultitude bore ill-will against that band on account of what they had suffered\nfrom it; so he changed the band as they desired, and, with the rest of\nhis forces, returned to Cesarea.", "HOWEVER, Florus contrived another way to oblige the Jews to begin\nthe war, and sent to Cestius, and accused the Jews falsely of revolting\n[from the Roman government], and imputed the beginning of the former fight\nto them, and pretended they had been the authors of that disturbance, wherein\nthey were only the sufferers. Yet were not the governors of Jerusalem silent\nupon this occasion, but did themselves write to Cestius, as did Bernice\nalso, about the illegal practices of which Florus had been guilty against\nthe city; who, upon reading both accounts, consulted with his captains\n[what he should do]. Now some of them thought it best for Cestius to go\nup with his army, either to punish the revolt, if it was real, or to settle\nthe Roman affairs on a surer foundation, if the Jews continued quiet under\nthem; but he thought it best himself to send one of his intimate friends\nbeforehand, to see the state of affairs, and to give him a faithful account\nof the intentions of the Jews. Accordingly, he sent one of his tribunes,\nwhose name was Neopolitanus, who met with king Agrippa as he was returning\nfrom Alexandria, at Jamnia, and told him who it was that sent him, and\non what errands he was sent.", "And here it was that the high priests, and men of power among the\nJews, as well as the sanhedrim, came to congratulate the king [upon his\nsafe return]; and after they had paid him their respects, they lamented\ntheir own calamities, and related to him what barbarous treatment they\nhad met with from Florus. At which barbarity Agrippa had great indignation,\nbut transferred, after a subtle manner, his anger towards those Jews whom\nhe really pitied, that he might beat down their high thoughts of themselves,\nand would have them believe that they had not been so unjustly treated,\nin order to dissuade them from avenging themselves. So these great men,\nas of better understanding than the rest, and desirous of peace, because\nof the possessions they had, understood that this rebuke which the king\ngave them was intended for their good; but as to the people, they came\nsixty furlongs out of Jerusalem, and congratulated both Agrippa and Neopolitanus;\nbut the wives of those that had been slain came running first of all and\nlamenting. The people also, when they heard their mourning, fell into lamentations\nalso, and besought Agrippa to assist them: they also cried out to Neopolitanus,\nand complained of the many miseries they had endured under Florus; and\nthey showed them, when they were come into the city, how the market-place\nwas made desolate, and the houses plundered. They then persuaded Neopolitanus,\nby the means of Agrippa, that he would walk round the city, with one only\nservant, as far as Siloam, that he might inform himself that the Jews submitted\nto all the rest of the Romans, and were only displeased at Florus, by reason\nof his exceeding barbarity to them. So he walked round, and had sufficient\nexperience of the good temper the people were in, and then went up to the\ntemple, where he called the multitude together, and highly commended them\nfor their fidelity to the Romans, and earnestly exhorted them to keep the\npeace; and having performed such parts of Divine worship at the temple\nas he was allowed to do, he returned to Cestius.", "But as for the multitude of the Jews, they addressed themselves to\nthe king, and to the high priests, and desired they might have leave to\nsend ambassadors to Nero against Florus, and not by their silence afford\na suspicion that they had been the occasions of such great slaughters as\nhad been made, and were disposed to revolt, alleging that they should seem\nto have been the first beginners of the war, if they did not prevent the\nreport by showing who it was that began it; and it appeared openly that\nthey would not be quiet, if any body should hinder them from sending such\nan embassage. But Agrippa, although he thought it too dangerous a thing\nfor them to appoint men to go as the accusers of Florus, yet did he not\nthink it fit for him to overlook them, as they were in a disposition for\nwar. He therefore called the multitude together into a large gallery, and\nplaced his sister Bernice in the house of the Asamoneans, that she might\nbe seen by them, (which house was over the gallery, at the passage to the\nupper city, where the bridge joined the temple to the gallery,) and spake\nto them as follows:", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "In this speech of king Agrippa we have an authentic account of the extent\nand strength of the Roman empire when the Jewish war began. And this speech\nwith other circumstances in Josephus, demonstrate how wise and how great\na person Agrippa was, and why Josephus elsewhere calls him a most wonderful\nor admirable man, Contr. Ap. I. 9. He is the same Agrippa who said to Paul,\"\nAlmost thou persuadest me to be a Christian,\" Acts 26;28; and of whom\nSt. Paul said, \"He was expert in all the customs and questions of\nthe Jews,\" yet. 3. See another intimation of the limits of the same\nRoman empire, Of the War, B. III. ch. 5. sect. 7. But what seems to me\nvery remarkable here is this, that when Josephus, in imitation of the Greeks\nand Romans, for whose use he wrote his Antiquities, did himself frequently\nhe into their they appear, by the politeness of their composition, and\ntheir flights of oratory, to be not the real speeches of the persons concerned,\nwho usually were no orators, but of his own elegant composure, the speech\nbefore us is of another nature, full of undeniable facts, and composed\nin a plain and unartful, but moving way; so it appears to be king Agrippa's\nown speech, and to have been given Josephus by Agrippa himself, with whom\nJosephus had the greatest friendship. Nor may we omit Agrippa's constant\ndoctrine here, that this vast Roman empire was raised and supported by\nDivine Providence, and that therefore it was in vain for the Jews, or any\nothers, to think of destroying it. Nor may we neglect to take notice of\nAgrippa's solemn appeal to the angels here used; the like appeals to which\nwe have in St. Paul, 1 Timothy 5:22, and by the apostles in general, in\nthe form of the ordination of bishops, Constitut. Apost. VIII. 4."}, "#text": "\" Had I perceived that you were all zealously disposed to go to war\nwith the Romans, and that the purer and more sincere part of the people\ndid not propose to live in peace, I had not come out to you, nor been so\nbold as to give you counsel; for all discourses that tend to persuade men\nto do what they ought to do are superfluous, when the hearers are agreed\nto do the contrary. But because some are earnest to go to war because they\nare young, and without experience of the miseries it brings, and because\nsome are for it out of an unreasonable expectation of regaining their liberty,\nand because others hope to get by it, and are therefore earnestly bent\nupon it, that in the confusion of your affairs they may gain what belongs\nto those that are too weak to resist them, I have thought proper to get\nyou all together, and to say to you what I think to be for your advantage;\nthat so the former may grow wiser, and change their minds, and that the\nbest men may come to no harm by the ill conduct of some others. And let\nnot any one be tumultuous against me, in case what they hear me say do\nnot please them; for as to those that admit of no cure, but are resolved\nupon a revolt, it will still be in their power to retain the same sentiments\nafter my exhortation is over; but still my discourse will fall to the ground,\neven with a relation to those that have a mind to hear me, unless you will\nall keep silence. I am well aware that many make a tragical exclamation\nconcerning the injuries that have been offered you by your procurators,\nand concerning the glorious advantages of liberty; but before I begin the\ninquiry, who you are that must go to war, and who they are against whom\nyou must fight, I shall first separate those pretenses that are by some\nconnected together; for if you aim at avenging yourselves on those that\nhave done you injury, why do you pretend this to be a war for recovering\nyour liberty? but if you think all servitude intolerable, to what purpose\nserve your complaint against your particular governors? for if they treated\nyou with moderation, it would still be equally an unworthy thing to be\nin servitude. Consider now the several cases that may be supposed, how\nlittle occasion there is for your going to war. Your first occasion is\nthe accusations you have to make against your procurators; now here you\nought to be submissive to those in authority, and not give them any provocation;\nbut when you reproach men greatly for small offenses, you excite those\nwhom you reproach to be your adversaries; for this will only make them\nleave off hurting you privately, and with some degree of modesty, and to\nlay what you have waste openly. Now nothing so much damps the force of\nstrokes as bearing them with patience; and the quietness of those who are\ninjured diverts the injurious persons from afflicting. But let us take\nit for granted that the Roman ministers are injurious to you, and are incurably\nsevere; yet are they not all the Romans who thus injure you; nor hath Caesar,\nagainst whom you are going to make war, injured you: it is not by their\ncommand that any wicked governor is sent to you; for they who are in the\nwest cannot see those that are in the east; nor indeed is it easy for them\nthere even to hear what is done in these parts. Now it is absurd to make\nwar with a great many for the sake of one, to do so with such mighty people\nfor a small cause; and this when these people are not able to know of what\nyou complain: nay, such crimes as we complain of may soon be corrected,\nfor the same procurator will not continue for ever; and probable it is\nthat the successors will come with more moderate inclinations. But as for\nwar, if it be once begun, it is not easily laid down again, nor borne without\ncalamities coming therewith. However, as to the desire of recovering your\nliberty, it is unseasonable to indulge it so late; whereas you ought to\nhave labored earnestly in old time that you might never have lost it; for\nthe first experience of slavery was hard to be endured, and the struggle\nthat you might never have been subject to it would have been just; but\nthat slave who hath been once brought into subjection, and then runs away,\nis rather a refractory slave than a lover of liberty; for it was then the\nproper time for doing all that was possible, that you might never have\nadmitted the Romans [into your city], when Pompey came first into the country.\nBut so it was, that our ancestors and their kings, who were in much better\ncircumstances than we are, both as to money, and strong bodies, and [valiant]\nsouls, did not bear the onset of a small body of the Roman army. And yet\nyou, who have now accustomed yourselves to obedience from one generation\nto another, and who are so much inferior to those who first submitted,\nin your circumstances will venture to oppose the entire empire of the Romans.\nWhile those Athenians, who, in order to preserve the liberty of Greece,\ndid once set fire to their own city; who pursued Xerxes, that proud prince,\nwhen he sailed upon the land, and walked upon the sea, and could not be\ncontained by the seas, but conducted such an army as was too broad for\nEurope; and made him run away like a fugitive in a single ship, and brake\nso great a part of Asia at the Lesser Salamis; are yet at this time servants\nto the Romans; and those injunctions which are sent from Italy become laws\nto the principal governing city of Greece. Those Lacedemonians also who\ngot the great victories at Thermopylae. and Platea, and had Agesilaus [for\ntheir king], and searched every corner of Asia, are contented to admit\nthe same lords. Those Macedonians also, who still fancy what great men\ntheir Philip and Alexander were, and see that the latter had promised them\nthe empire over the world, these bear so great a change, and pay their\nobedience to those whom fortune hath advanced in their stead. Moreover,\nten thousand ether nations there are who had greater reason than we to\nclaim their entire liberty, and yet do submit. You are the only people\nwho think it a disgrace to be servants to those to whom all the world hath\nsubmitted. What sort of an army do you rely on? What are the arms you depend\non? Where is your fleet, that may seize upon the Roman seas? and where\nare those treasures which may be sufficient for your undertakings? Do you\nsuppose, I pray you, that you are to make war with the Egyptians, and with\nthe Arabians? Will you not carefully reflect upon the Roman empire? Will\nyou not estimate your own weakness? Hath not your army been often beaten\neven by your neighboring nations, while the power of the Romans is invincible\nin all parts of the habitable earth? nay, rather they seek for somewhat\nstill beyond that; for all Euphrates is not a sufficient boundary for them\non the east side, nor the Danube on the north; and for their southern limit,\nLibya hath been searched over by them, as far as countries uninhabited,\nas is Cadiz their limit on the west; nay, indeed, they have sought for\nanother habitable earth beyond the ocean, and have carried their arms as\nfar as such British islands as were never known before. What therefore\ndo you pretend to? Are you richer than the Gauls, stronger than the Germans,\nwiser than the Greeks, more numerous than all men upon the habitable earth?\nWhat confidence is it that elevates you to oppose the Romans? Perhaps it\nwill be said, It is hard to endure slavery. Yes; but how much harder is\nthis to the Greeks, who were esteemed the noblest of all people under the\nsun! These, though they inhabit in a large country, are in subjection to\nsix bundles of Roman rods. It is the same case with the Macedonians, who\nhave juster reason to claim their liberty than you have. What is the case\nof five hundred cities of Asia? Do they not submit to a single governor,\nand to the consular bundle of rods? What need I speak of the Henlochi,\nand Colchi and the nation of Tauri, those that inhabit the Bosphorus, and\nthe nations about Pontus, and Meotis, who formerly knew not so much as\na lord of their own, but arc now subject to three thousand armed men, and\nwhere forty long ships keep the sea in peace, which before was not navigable,\nand very tempestuous? How strong a plea may Bithynia, and Cappadocia, and\nthe people of Pamphylia, the Lycians, and Cilicians, put in for liberty!\nBut they are made tributary without an army. What are the circumstances\nof the Thracians, whose country extends in breadth five days' journey,\nand in length seven, and is of a much more harsh constitution, and much\nmore defensible, than yours, and by the rigor of its cold sufficient to\nkeep off armies from attacking them? do not they submit to two thousand\nmen of the Roman garrisons? Are not the Illyrlans, who inhabit the country\nadjoining, as far as Dalmatia and the Danube, governed by barely two legions?\nby which also they put a stop to the incursions of the Daeians. And for\nthe Dalmatians, who have made such frequent insurrections in order to regain\ntheir liberty, and who could never before be so thoroughly subdued, but\nthat they always gathered their forces together again, revolted, yet are\nthey now very quiet under one Roman legion. Moreover, if eat advantages\nmight provoke any people to revolt, the Gauls might do it best of all,\nas being so thoroughly walled round by nature; on the east side by the\nAlps, on the north by the river Rhine, on the south by the Pyrenean mountains,\nand on the west by the ocean. Now although these Gauls have such obstacles\nbefore them to prevent any attack upon them, and have no fewer than three\nhundred and five nations among them, nay have, as one may say, the fountains\nof domestic happiness within themselves, and send out plentiful streams\nof happiness over almost the whole world, these bear to be tributary to\nthe Romans, and derive their prosperous condition from them; and they undergo\nthis, not because they are of effeminate minds, or because they are of\nan ignoble stock, as having borne a war of eighty years in order to preserve\ntheir liberty; but by reason of the great regard they have to the power\nof the Romans, and their good fortune, which is of greater efficacy than\ntheir arms. These Gauls, therefore, are kept in servitude by twelve hundred\nsoldiers, which are hardly so many as are their cities; nor hath the gold\ndug out of the mines of Spain been sufficient for the support of a war\nto preserve their liberty, nor could their vast distance from the Romans\nby land and by sea do it; nor could the martial tribes of the Lusitanians\nand Spaniards escape; no more could the ocean, with its tide, which yet\nwas terrible to the ancient inhabitants. Nay, the Romans have extended\ntheir arms beyond the pillars of Hercules, and have walked among the clouds,\nupon the Pyrenean mountains, and have subdued these nations. And one legion\nis a sufficient guard for these people, although they were so hard to be\nconquered, and at a distance so remote from Rome. Who is there among you\nthat hath not heard of the great number of the Germans? You have, to be\nsure, yourselves seen them to be strong and tall, and that frequently,\nsince the Romans have them among their captives every where; yet these\nGermans, who dwell in an immense country, who have minds greater than their\nbodies, and a soul that despises death, and who are in rage more fierce\nthan wild beasts, have the Rhine for the boundary of their enterprises,\nand are tamed by eight Roman legions. Such of them as were taken captive\nbecame their servants; and the rest of the entire nation were obliged to\nsave themselves by flight. Do you also, who depend on the walls of Jerusalem,\nconsider what a wall the Britons had; for the Romans sailed away to them,\nan subdued them while they were encompassed by the ocean, and inhabited\nan island that is not less than the [continent of this] habitable earth;\nand four legions are a sufficient guard to so large all island And why\nshould I speak much more about this matter, while the Parthians, that most\nwarlike body of men, and lords of so many nations, and encompassed with\nsuch mighty forces, send hostages to the Romans? whereby you may see, if\nyou please, even in Italy, the noblest nation of the East, under the notion\nof peace, submitting to serve them. Now when almost all people under the\nsun submit to the Roman arms, will you be the only people that make war\nagainst them? and this without regarding the fate of the Carthaginians,\nwho, in the midst of their brags of the great Hannibal, and the nobility\nof their Phoenician original, fell by the hand of Scipio. Nor indeed have\nthe Cyrenians, derived from the Lacedemonians, nor the Marmaridite, a nation\nextended as far as the regions uninhabitable for want of water, nor have\nthe Syrtes, a place terrible to such as barely hear it described, the Nasamons\nand Moors, and the immense multitude of the Numidians, been able to put\na stop to the Roman valor. And as for the third part of the habitable earth,\n[Akica,] whose nations are so many that it is not easy to number them,\nand which is bounded by the Atlantic Sea and the pillars of Hercules, and\nfeeds an innumerable multitude of Ethiopians, as far as the Red Sea, these\nhave the Romans subdued entirely. And besides the annual fruits of the\nearth, which maintain the multitude of the Romans for eight months in the\nyear, this, over and above, pays all sorts of tribute, and affords revenues\nsuitable to the necessities of the government. Nor do they, like you, esteem\nsuch injunctions a disgrace to them, although they have but one Roman legion\nthat abides among them. And indeed what occasion is there for showing you\nthe power of the Romans over remote countries, when it is so easy to learn\nit from Egypt, in your neighborhood? This country is extended as far as\nthe Ethiopians, and Arabia the Happy, and borders upon India; it hath seven\nmillions five hundred thousand men, besides the inhabitants of Alexandria,\nas may be learned from the revenue of the poll tax; yet it is not ashamed\nto submit to the Roman government, although it hath Alexandria as a grand\ntemptation to a revolt, by reason it is so full of people and of riches,\nand is besides exceeding large, its length being thirty furlongs, and its\nbreadth no less than ten; and it pays more tribute to the Romans in one\nmonth than you do in a year; nay, besides what it pays in money, it sends\ncorn to Rome that supports it for four months [in the year]: it is also\nwalled round on all sides, either by almost impassable deserts, or seas\nthat have no havens, or by rivers, or by lakes; yet have none of these\nthings been found too strong for the Roman good fortune; however, two legions\nthat lie in that city are a bridle both for the remoter parts of Egypt,\nand for the parts inhabited by the more noble Macedonians. Where then are\nthose people whom you are to have for your auxiliaries? Must they come\nfrom the parts of the world that are uninhabited? for all that are in the\nhabitable earth are [under the] Romans. Unless any of you extend his hopes\nas far as beyond the Euphrates, and suppose that those of your own nation\nthat dwell in Adiabene will come to your assistance; but certainly these\nwill not embarrass themselves with an unjustifiable war, nor, if they should\nfollow such ill advice, will the Parthians permit them so to do; for it\nis their concern to maintain the truce that is between them and the Romans,\nand they will be supposed to break the covenants between them, if any under\ntheir government march against the Romans. What remains, therefore, is\nthis, that you have recourse to Divine assistance; but this is already\non the side of the Romans; for it is impossible that so vast an empire\nshould be settled without God's providence. Reflect upon it, how impossible\nit is for your zealous observations of your religious customs to be here\npreserved, which are hard to be observed even when you fight with those\nwhom you are able to conquer; and how can you then most of all hope for\nGod's assistance, when, by being forced to transgress his law, you will\nmake him turn his face from you? and if you do observe the custom of the\nsabbath days, and will not be revealed on to do any thing thereon, you\nwill easily be taken, as were your forefathers by Pompey, who was the busiest\nin his siege on those days on which the besieged rested. But if in time\nof war you transgress the law of your country, I cannot tell on whose account\nyou will afterward go to war; for your concern is but one, that you do\nnothing against any of your forefathers; and how will you call upon God\nto assist you, when you are voluntarily transgressing against his religion?\nNow all men that go to war do it either as depending on Divine or on human\nassistance; but since your going to war will cut off both those assistances,\nthose that are for going to war choose evident destruction. What hinders\nyou from slaying your children and wives with your own hands, and burning\nthis most excellent native city of yours? for by this mad prank you will,\nhowever, escape the reproach of being beaten. But it were best, O my friends,\nit were best, while the vessel is still in the haven, to foresee the impending\nstorm, and not to set sail out of the port into the middle of the hurricanes;\nfor we justly pity those who fall into great misfortunes without fore-seeing\nthem; but for him who rushes into manifest ruin, he gains reproaches [instead\nof commiseration]. But certainly no one can imagine that you can enter\ninto a war as by agreement, or that when the Romans have got you under\ntheir power, they will use you with moderation, or will not rather, for\nan example to other nations, burn your holy city, and utterly destroy your\nwhole nation; for those of you who shall survive the war will not be able\nto find a place whither to flee, since all men have the Romans for their\nlords already, or are afraid they shall have hereafter. Nay, indeed, the\ndanger concerns not those Jews that dwell here only, but those of them\nwhich dwell in other cities also; for there is no people upon the habitable\nearth which have not some portion of you among them, whom your enemies\nwill slay, in case you go to war, and on that account also; and so every\ncity which hath Jews in it will be filled with slaughter for the sake of\na few men, and they who slay them will be pardoned; but if that slaughter\nbe not made by them, consider how wicked a thing it is to take arms against\nthose that are so kind to you. Have pity, therefore, if not on your children\nand wives, yet upon this your metropolis, and its sacred walls; spare the\ntemple, and preserve the holy house, with its holy furniture, for yourselves;\nfor if the Romans get you under their power, they will no longer abstain\nfrom them, when their former abstinence shall have been so ungratefully\nrequited. I call to witness your sanctuary, and the holy angels of God,\nand this country common to us all, that I have not kept back any thing\nthat is for your preservation; and if you will follow that advice which\nyou ought to do, you will have that peace which will be common to you and\nto me; but if you indulge four passions, you will run those hazards which\nI shall be free from.\""}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Julius Caesar had decreed that the Jews of Jerusalem should pay an annual\ntribute to the Romans, excepting the city Joppa, and for the sabbatical\nyear; as Spanheim observes from the Antiq.

To which Agrippa\nreplied, that what they had already done was like such as make war against\nthe Romans; \"for you have not paid the tribute which is due to Caesar\n and\nyou have cut off the cloisters [of the temple] from joining to the tower\nAntonia. You will therefore prevent any occasion of revolt if you will\nbut join these together again, and if you will but pay your tribute; for\nthe citadel does not now belong to Florus, nor are you to pay the tribute\nmoney to Florus.\""}, "THIS advice the people hearkened to, and went up into the temple\nwith the king and Bernice, and began to rebuild the cloisters; the rulers\nalso and senators divided themselves into the villages, and collected the\ntributes, and soon got together forty talents, which was the sum that was\ndeficient. And thus did Agrippa then put a stop to that war which was threatened.\nMoreover, he attempted to persuade the multitude to obey Florus, until\nCaesar should send one to succeed him; but they were hereby more provoked,\nand cast reproaches upon the king, and got him excluded out of the city;\nnay, some of the seditious had the impudence to throw stones at him. So\nwhen the king saw that the violence of those that were for innovations\nwas not to be restrained, and being very angry at the contumelies he had\nreceived, he sent their rulers, together with their men of power, to Florus,\nto Cesarea, that he might appoint whom he thought fit to collect the tribute\nin the country, while he retired into his own kingdom.", "And at this time it was that some of those that principally excited\nthe people to go to war made an assault upon a certain fortress called\nMasada. They took it by treachery, and slew the Romans that were there,\nand put others of their own party to keep it. At the same time Eleazar,\nthe son of Ananias the high priest, a very bold youth, who was at that\ntime governor of the temple, persuaded those that officiated in the Divine\nservice to receive no gift or sacrifice for any foreigner. And this was\nthe true beginning of our war with the Romans; for they rejected the sacrifice\nof Caesar on this account; and when many of the high priests and principal\nmen besought them not to omit the sacrifice, which it was customary for\nthem to offer for their princes, they would not be prevailed upon. These\nrelied much upon their multitude, for the most flourishing part of the\ninnovators assisted them; but they had the chief regard to Eleazar, the\ngovernor of the temple.", "Hereupon the men of power got together, and conferred with the high\npriests, as did also the principal of the Pharisees; and thinking all was\nat stake, and that their calamities were becoming incurable, took counsel\nwhat was to be done. Accordingly, they determined to try what they could\ndo with the seditious by words, and assembled the people before the brazen\ngate, which was that gate of the inner temple [court of the priests] which\nlooked toward the sun-rising. And, in the first place, they showed the\ngreat indignation they had at this attempt for a revolt, and for their\nbringing so great a war upon their country; after which they confuted their\npretense as unjustifiable, and told them that their forefathers had adorned\ntheir temple in great part with donations bestowed on them by foreigners,\nand had always received what had been presented to them from foreign nations;\nand that they had been so far from rejecting any person's sacrifice (which\nwould be the highest instance of impiety,) that they had themselves placed\nthose donation about the temple which were still visible, and had remained\nthere so long a time; that they did now irritate the Romans to take arms\nagainst them, and invited them to make war upon them, and brought up novel\nrules of a strange Divine worship, and determined to run the hazard of\nhaving their city condemned for impiety, while they would not allow any\nforeigner, but Jews only, either to sacrifice or to worship therein. And\nif such a law should be introduced in the case of a single private person\nonly, he would have indignation at it, as an instance of inhumanity determined\nagainst him; while they have no regard to the Romans or to Caesar, and\nforbid even their oblations to be received also; that however they cannot\nbut fear, lest, by thus rejecting their sacrifices, they shall not be allowed\nto offer their own; and that this city will lose its principality, unless\nthey grow wiser quickly, and restore the sacrifices as formerly, and indeed\namend the injury [they have offered foreigners] before the report of it\ncomes to the ears of those that have been injured.", "And as they said these things, they produced those priests that were\nskillful in the customs of their country, who made the report that all\ntheir forefathers had received the sacrifices from foreign nations. But\nstill not one of the innovators would hearken to what was said; nay, those\nthat ministered about the temple would not attend their Divine service,\nbut were preparing matters for beginning the war. So the men of power perceiving\nthat the sedition was too hard for them to subdue, and that the danger\nwhich would arise from the Romans would come upon them first of all, endeavored\nto save themselves, and sent ambassadors, some to Florus, the chief of\nwhich was Simon the son of Ananias; and others to Agrippa, among whom the\nmost eminent were Saul, and Antipas, and Costobarus, who were of the king's\nkindred; and they desired of them both that they would come with an army\nto the city, and cut off the seditious before it should be too hard to\nbe subdued. Now this terrible message was good news to Florus; and because\nhis design was to have a war kindled, he gave the ambassadors no answer\nat all. But Agrippa was equally solicitous for those that were revolting,\nand for those against whom the war was to be made, and was desirous to\npreserve the Jews for the Romans, and the temple and metropolis for the\nJews; he was also sensible that it was not for his own advantage that the\ndisturbances should proceed; so he sent three thousand horsemen to the\nassistance of the people out of Auranitis, and Batanea, and Trachonitis,\nand these under Darius, the master of his horse, and Philip the son of\nJacimus, the general of his army.", "Upon this the men of power, with the high priests, as also all the\npart of the multitude that were desirous of peace, took courage, and seized\nupon the upper city [Mount Sion;] for the seditious part had the lower\ncity and the temple in their power; so they made use of stones and slings\nperpetually against one another, and threw darts continually on both sides;\nand sometimes it happened that they made incursions by troops, and fought\nit out hand to hand, while the seditious were superior in boldness, but\nthe king's soldiers in skill. These last strove chiefly to gain the temple,\nand to drive those out of it who profaned it; as did the seditious, with\nEleazar, besides what they had already, labor to gain the upper city. Thus\nwere there perpetual slaughters on both sides for seven days' time; but\nneither side would yield up the parts they had seized on.", "Now the next day was the festival of Xylophory; upon which the custom\nwas for every one to bring wood for the altar (that there might never be\na want of fuel for that fire which was unquenchable and always burning).\nUpon that day they excluded the opposite party from the observation of\nthis part of religion. And when they had joined to themselves many of the\nSicarii, who crowded in among the weaker people, (that was the name for\nsuch robbers as had under their bosoms swords called Sicae,) they grew\nbolder, and carried their undertaking further; insomuch that the king's\nsoldiers were overpowered by their multitude and boldness; and so they\ngave way, and were driven out of the upper city by force. The others then\nset fire to the house of Ananias the high priest, and to the palaces of\nAgrippa and Bernice; after which they carried the fire to the place where\nthe archives were reposited, and made haste to burn the contracts belonging\nto their creditors, and thereby to dissolve their obligations for paying\ntheir debts; and this was done in order to gain the multitude of those\nwho had been debtors, and that they might persuade the poorer sort to join\nin their insurrection with safety against the more wealthy; so the keepers\nof the records fled away, and the rest set fire to them. And when they\nhad thus burnt down the nerves of the city, they fell upon their enemies;\nat which time some of the men of power, and of the high priests, went into\nthe vaults under ground, and concealed themselves, while others fled with\nthe king's soldiers to the upper palace, and shut the gates immediately;\namong whom were Ananias the high priest, and the ambassadors that had been\nsent to Agrippa. And now the seditious were contented with the victory\nthey had gotten, and the buildings they had burnt down, and proceeded no\nfurther.", "But on the next day, which was the fifteenth of the month Lous, [Ab,]\nthey made an assault upon Antonia, and besieged the garrison which was\nin it two days, and then took the garrison, and slew them, and set the\ncitadel on fire; after which they marched to the palace, whither the king's\nsoldiers were fled, and parted themselves into four bodies, and made an\nattack upon the walls. As for those that were within it, no one had the\ncourage to sally out, because those that assaulted them were so numerous;\nbut they distributed themselves into the breast-works and turrets, and\nshot at the besiegers, whereby many of the robbers fell under the walls;\nnor did they cease to fight one with another either by night or by day,\nwhile the seditious supposed that those within would grow weary for want\nof food, and those without supposed the others would do the like by the\ntediousness of the siege.", "In the mean time, one Manahem, the son of Judas, that was called\nthe Galilean, (who was a very cunning sophister, and had formerly reproached\nthe Jews under Cyrenius, that after God they were subject to the Romans,)\ntook some of the men of note with him, and retired to Masada, where he\nbroke open king Herod's armory, and gave arms not only to his own people,\nbut to other robbers also. These he made use of for a guard, and returned\nin the state of a king to Jerusalem; he became the leader of the sedition,\nand gave orders for continuing the siege; but they wanted proper instruments,\nand it was not practicable to undermine the wall, because the darts came\ndown upon them from above. But still they dug a mine from a great distance\nunder one of the towers, and made it totter; and having done that, they\nset on fire what was combustible, and left it; and when the foundations\nwere burnt below, the tower fell down suddenly. Yet did they then meet\nwith another wall that had been built within, for the besieged were sensible\nbeforehand of what they were doing, and probably the tower shook as it\nwas undermining; so they provided themselves of another fortification;\nwhich when the besiegers unexpectedly saw, while they thought they had\nalready gained the place, they were under some consternation. However,\nthose that were within sent to Manahem, and to the other leaders of the\nsedition, and desired they might go out upon a capitulation: this was granted\nto the king's soldiers and their own countrymen only, who went out accordingly;\nbut the Romans that were left alone were greatly dejected, for they were\nnot able to force their way through such a multitude; and to desire them\nto give them their right hand for their security, they thought it would\nbe a reproach to them; and besides, if they should give it them, they durst\nnot depend upon it; so they deserted their camp, as easily taken, and ran\naway to the royal towers, - that called Hippicus, that called Phasaelus,\nand that called Mariamne. But Manahem and his party fell upon the place\nwhence the soldiers were fled, and slew as many of them as they could catch,\nbefore they got up to the towers, and plundered what they left behind them,\nand set fire to their camp. This was executed on the sixth day of the month\nGorpieus [Elul].", "But on the next day the high priest was caught where he had concealed\nhimself in an aqueduct; he was slain, together with Hezekiah his brother,\nby the robbers: hereupon the seditious besieged the towers, and kept them\nguarded, lest any one of the soldiers should escape. Now the overthrow\nof the places of strength, and the death of the high priest Ananias, so\npuffed up Manahem, that he became barbarously cruel; and as he thought\nhe had no antagonist to dispute the management of affairs with him, he\nwas no better than an insupportable tyrant; but Eleazar and his party,\nwhen words had passed between them, how it was not proper when they revolted\nfrom the Romans, out of the desire of liberty, to betray that liberty to\nany of their own people, and to bear a lord, who, though he should be guilty\nof no violence, was yet meaner than themselves; as also, that in case they\nwere obliged to set some one over their public affairs, it was fitter they\nshould give that privilege to any one rather than to him; they made an\nassault upon him in the temple; for he went up thither to worship in a\npompous manner, and adorned with royal garments, and had his followers\nwith him in their armor. But Eleazar and his party fell violently upon\nhim, as did also the rest of the people; and taking up stones to attack\nhim withal, they threw them at the sophister, and thought, that if he were\nonce ruined, the entire sedition would fall to the ground. Now Manahem\nand his party made resistance for a while; but when they perceived that\nthe whole multitude were falling upon them, they fled which way every one\nwas able; those that were caught were slain, and those that hid themselves\nwere searched for. A few there were of them who privately escaped to Masada,\namong whom was Eleazar, the son of Jairus, who was of kin to Manahem, and\nacted the part of a tyrant at Masada afterward. As for Manahem himself,\nhe ran away to the place called Ophla, and there lay skulking in private;\nbut they took him alive, and drew him out before them all; they then tortured\nhim with many sorts of torments, and after all slew him, as they did by\nthose that were captains under him also, and particularly by the principal\ninstrument of his tyranny, whose name was Apsalom.", "And, as I said, so far truly the people assisted them, while they\nhoped this might afford some amendment to the seditious practices; but\nthe others were not in haste to put an end to the war, but hoped to prosecute\nit with less danger, now they had slain Manahem. It is true, that when\nthe people earnestly desired that they would leave off besieging the soldiers,\nthey were the more earnest in pressing it forward, and this till Metilius,\nwho was the Roman general, sent to Eleazar, and desired that they would.\ngive them security to spare their lives only; but agreed to deliver up\ntheir arms, and what else they had with them. The others readily complied\nwith their petition, sent to them Gorion, the son of Nicodemus, and Ananias,\nthe son of Sadduk, and Judas, the son of Jonathan, that they might give\nthem the security Of their right hands, and of their oaths; after which\nMetilius brought down his soldiers; which soldiers, while they were in\narms, were not meddled with by any of the seditious, nor was there any\nappearance of treachery; but as soon as, according to the articles of capitulation,\nthey had all laid down their shields and their swords, and were under no\nfurther suspicion of any harm, but were going away, Eleazar's men attacked\nthem after a violent manner, and encompassed them round, and slew them,\nwhile they neither defended themselves, nor entreated for mercy, but only\ncried out upon the breach of their articles of capitulation and their oaths.\nAnd thus were all these men barbarously murdered, excepting Metilius; for\nwhen he entreated for mercy, and promised that he would turn Jew, and be\ncircumcised, they saved him alive, but none else. This loss to the Romans\nwas but light, there being no more than a few slain out of an immense army;\nbut still it appeared to be a prelude to the Jews' own destruction, while\nmen made public lamentation when they saw that such occasions were afforded\nfor a war as were incurable; that the city was all over polluted with such\nabominations, from which it was but reasonable to expect some vengeance,\neven though they should escape revenge from the Romans; so that the city\nwas filled with sadness, and every one of the moderate men in it were under\ngreat disturbance, as likely themselves to undergo punishment for the wickedness\nof the seditious; for indeed it so happened that this murder was perpetrated\non the sabbath day, on which day the Jews have a respite from their works\non account of Divine worship.", "NOW the people of Cesarea had slain the Jews that were among them\non the very same day and hour [when the soldiers were slain], which one\nwould think must have come to pass by the direction of Providence; insomuch\nthat in one hour's time above twenty thousand Jews were killed, and all\nCesarea was emptied of its Jewish inhabitants; for Florus caught such as\nran away, and sent them in bonds to the galleys. Upon which stroke that\nthe Jews received at Cesarea, the whole nation was greatly enraged; so\nthey divided themselves into several parties, and laid waste the villages\nof the Syrians, and their neighboring cities, Philadelphia, and Sebonitis,\nand Gerasa, and Pella, and Scythopolis, and after them Gadara, and Hippos;\nand falling upon Gaulonitis, some cities they destroyed there, and some\nthey set on fire, and then went to Kedasa, belonging to the Tyrians, and\nto Ptolemais, and to Gaba, and to Cesarea; nor was either Sebaste [Samaria]\nor Askelon able to oppose the violence with which they were attacked; and\nwhen they had burnt these to the ground; they entirely demolished Anthedon\nand Gaza; many also of the villages that were about every one of those\ncities were plundered, and an immense slaughter was made of the men who\nwere caught in them.", "However, the Syrians were even with the Jews in the multitude of\nthe men whom they slew; for they killed those whom they caught in their\ncities, and that not only out of the hatred they bare them, as formerly,\nbut to prevent the danger under which they were from them; so that the\ndisorders in all Syria were terrible, and every city was divided into two\narmies, encamped one against another, and the preservation of the one party\nwas in the destruction of the other; so the day time was spent in shedding\nof blood, and the night in fear, which was of the two the more terrible;\nfor when the Syrians thought they had ruined the Jews, they had the Judaizers\nin suspicion also; and as each side did not care to slay those whom they\nonly suspected on the other, so did they greatly fear them when they were\nmingled with the other, as if they were certainly foreigners. Moreover,\ngreediness of gain was a provocation to kill the opposite party, even to\nsuch as had of old appeared very mild and gentle towards them; for they\nwithout fear plundered the effects of the slain, and carried off the spoils\nof those whom they slew to their own houses, as if they had been gained\nin a set battle; and he was esteemed a man of honor who got the greatest\nshare, as having prevailed over the greatest number of his enemies. It\nwas then common to see cities filled with dead bodies, still lying unburied,\nand those of old men, mixed with infants, all dead, and scattered about\ntogether; women also lay amongst them, without any covering for their nakedness:\nyou might then see the whole province full of inexpressible calamities,\nwhile the dread of still more barbarous practices which were threatened\nwas every where greater than what had been already perpetrated.", "And thus far the conflict had been between Jews and foreigners; but\nwhen they made excursions to Scythopolis, they found Jew that acted as\nenemies; for as they stood in battle-array with those of Scythopolis, and\npreferred their own safety before their relation to us, they fought against\ntheir own countrymen; nay, their alacrity was so very great, that those\nof Scythopolis suspected them. These were afraid, therefore, lest they\nshould make an assault upon the city in the night time, and, to their great\nmisfortune, should thereby make an apology for themselves to their own\npeople for their revolt from them. So they commanded them, that in case\nthey would confirm their agreement and demonstrate their fidelity to them,\nwho were of a different nation, they should go out of the city, with their\nfamilies to a neighboring grove; and when they had done as they were commanded,\nwithout suspecting any thing, the people of Scythopolis lay still for the\ninterval of two days, to tempt them to be secure; but on the third night\nthey watched their opportunity, and cut all their throats, some as they\nlay unguarded, and some as they lay asleep. The number that was slain was\nabove thirteen thousand, and then they plundered them of all that they\nhad.", "It will deserve our relation what befell Simon; he was the son of\none Saul, a man of reputation among the Jews. This man was distinguished\nfrom the rest by the strength of his body, and the boldness of his conduct,\nalthough he abused them both to the mischieving of his countrymen; for\nhe came every day and slew a great many of the Jews of Scythopolis, and\nhe frequently put them to flight, and became himself alone the cause of\nhis army's conquering. But a just punishment overtook him for the murders\nhe had committed upon those of the same nation with him; for when the people\nof Scythopolis threw their darts at them in the grove, he drew his sword,\nbut did not attack any of the enemy; for he saw that he could do nothing\nagainst such a multitude; but he cried out after a very moving manner,\nand said, \"O you people of Scythopolis, I deservedly suffer for what\nI have done with relation to you, when I gave you such security of my fidelity\nto you, by slaying so many of those that were related to me. Wherefore\nwe very justly experience the perfidiousness of foreigners, while we acted\nafter a most wicked manner against our own nation. I will therefore die,\npolluted wretch as I am, by nine own hands; for it is not fit I should\ndie by the hand of our enemies; and let the same action be to me both a\npunishment for my great crimes, and a testimony of my courage to my commendation,\nthat so no one of our enemies may have it to brag of, that he it was that\nslew me, and no one may insult upon me as I fall.\" Now when he had\nsaid this, he looked round about him upon his family with eyes of commiseration\nand of rage (that family consisted of a wife and children, and his aged\nparents); so, in the first place, he caught his father by his grey hairs,\nand ran his sword through him, and after him he did the same to his mother,\nwho willingly received it; and after them he did the like to his wife and\nchildren, every one almost offering themselves to his sword, as desirous\nto prevent being slain by their enemies; so when he had gone over all his\nfamily, he stood upon their bodies to be seen by all, and stretching out\nhis right hand, that his action might be observed by all, he sheathed his\nentire sword into his own bowels. This young man was to be pitied, on account\nof the strength of his body and the courage of his soul; but since he had\nassured foreigners of his fidelity [against his own countrymen], he suffered\ndeservedly.", "Besides this murder at Scythopolis, the other cities rose up against\nthe Jews that were among them; those of Askelon slew two thousand five\nhundred, and those of Ptolemais two thousand, and put not a few into bonds;\nthose of Tyre also put a great number to death, but kept a greater number\nin prison; moreover, those of Hippos, and those of Gadara, did the like\nwhile they put to death the boldest of the Jews, but kept those of whom\nthey were afraid in custody; as did the rest of the cities of Syria, according\nas they every one either hated them or were afraid of them; only the Antiochtans\nthe Sidontans, and Apamians spared those that dwelt with them, and would\nnot endure either to kill any of the Jews, or to put them in bonds. And\nperhaps they spared them, because their own number was so great that they\ndespised their attempts. But I think the greatest part of this favor was\nowing to their commiseration of those whom they saw to make no innovations.\nAs for the Gerasans, they did no harm to those that abode with them; and\nfor those who had a mind to go away, they conducted them as far as their\nborders reached.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Of this Sohemus we have mention made by Tacitus.

This Noarus sent out some\nof the king's armed men by night, and slew all those [seventy] men; which\nbold action he ventured upon without the consent of Agrippa, and was such\na lover of money, that he chose to be so wicked to his own countrymen,\nthough he brought ruin on the kingdom thereby; and thus cruelly did he\ntreat that nation, and this contrary to the laws also, until Agrippa was\ninformed of it, who did not indeed dare to put him to death, out of regard\nto Sohemus; but still he put an end to his procuratorship immediately.\nBut as to the seditious, they took the citadel which was called Cypros,\nand was above Jericho, and cut the throats of the garrison, and utterly\ndemolished the fortifications. This was about the same time that the multitude\nof the Jews that were at Machorus persuaded the Romans who were in garrison\nto leave the place, and deliver it up to them. These Romans being in great\nfear, lest the place should be taken by force, made an agreement with them\nto depart upon certain conditions; and when they had obtained the security\nthey desired, they delivered up the citadel, into which the people of Macherus\nput a garrison for their own security, and held it in their own power."}, "But for Alexandria, the sedition of the people of the place against\nthe Jews was perpetual, and this from that very time when Alexander [the\nGreat], upon finding the readiness of the Jews in assisting him against\nthe Egyptians, and as a reward for such their assistance, gave them equal\nprivileges in this city with the Grecians themselves; which honorary reward\nContinued among them under his successors, who also set apart for them\na particular place, that they might live without being polluted [by the\nGentiles], and were thereby not so much intermixed with foreigners as before;\nthey also gave them this further privilege, that they should be called\nMacedonians. Nay, when the Romans got possession of Egypt, neither the\nfirst Caesar, nor any one that came after him, thought of diminishing the\nhonors which Alexander had bestowed on the Jews. But still conflicts perpetually\narose with the Grecians; and although the governors did every day punish\nmany of them, yet did the sedition grow worse; but at this time especially,\nwhen there were tumults in other places also, the disorders among them\nwere put into a greater flame; for when the Alexandrians had once a public\nassembly, to deliberate about an embassage they were sending to Nero, a\ngreat number of Jews came flocking to the theater; but when their adversaries\nsaw them, they immediately cried out, and called them their enemies, and\nsaid they came as spies upon them; upon which they rushed out, and laid\nviolent hands upon them; and as for the rest, they were slain as they ran\naway; but there were three men whom they caught, and hauled them along,\nin order to have them burnt alive; but all the Jews came in a body to defend\nthem, who at first threw stones at the Grecians, but after that they took\nlamps, and rushed with violence into the theater, and threatened that they\nwould burn the people to a man; and this they had soon done, unless Tiberius\nAlexander, the governor of the city, had restrained their passions. However,\nthis man did not begin to teach them wisdom by arms, but sent among them\nprivately some of the principal men, and thereby entreated them to be quiet,\nand not provoke the Roman army against them; but the seditious made a jest\nof the entreaties of Tiberius, and reproached him for so doing.", "Now when he perceived that those who were for innovations would not\nbe pacified till some great calamity should overtake them, he sent out\nupon them those two Roman legions that were in the city, and together with\nthem five thousand other soldiers, who, by chance, were come together out\nof Libya, to the ruin of the Jews. They were also permitted not only to\nkill them, but to plunder them of what they had, and to set fire to their\nhouses. These soldiers rushed violently into that part of the city that\nwas called Delta, where the Jewish people lived together, and did as they\nwere bidden, though not without bloodshed on their own side also; for the\nJews got together, and set those that were the best armed among them in\nthe forefront, and made a resistance for a great while; but when once they\ngave back, they were destroyed unmercifully; and this their destruction\nwas complete, some being caught in the open field, and others forced into\ntheir houses, which houses were first plundered of what was in them, and\nthen set on fire by the Romans; wherein no mercy was shown to the infants,\nand no regard had to the aged; but they went on in the slaughter of persons\nof every age, till all the place was overflowed with blood, and fifty thousand\nof them lay dead upon heaps; nor had the remainder been preserved, had\nthey not be-taken themselves to supplication. So Alexander commiserated\ntheir condition, and gave orders to the Romans to retire; accordingly,\nthese being accustomed to obey orders, left off killing at the first intimation;\nbut the populace of Alexandria bare so very great hatred to the Jews, that\nit was difficult to recall them, and it was a hard thing to make them leave\ntheir dead bodies.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Spanheim notes on the place, that this later Antiochus, who was called\nEpiphaues, is mentioned by Dio, LIX. p. 645, and that he is mentioned by\nJosephus elsewhere twice also, B.V. ch. 11. sect. 3; and Antiq.

There were also\ngreat numbers of auxiliaries gathered together from the [free] cities,\nwho indeed had not the same skill in martial affairs, but made up in their\nalacrity and in their hatred to the Jews what they wanted in skill. There\ncame also along with Cestius Agrippa himself, both as a guide in his march\nover the country, and a director what was fit to be done; so Cestius took\npart of his forces, and marched hastily to Zabulon, a strong city of Galilee,\nwhich was called the City of Men, and divides the country of Ptolemais\nfrom our nation; this he found deserted by its men, the multitude having\nfled to the mountains, but full of all sorts of good things; those he gave\nleave to the soldiers to plunder, and set fire to the city, although it\nwas of admirable beauty, and had its houses built like those in Tyre, and\nSidon, and Berytus. After this he overran all the country, and seized upon\nwhatsoever came in his way, and set fire to the villages that were round\nabout them, and then returned to Ptolemais. But when the Syrians, and especially\nthose of Berytus, were busy in plundering, the Jews pulled up their courage\nagain, for they knew that Cestius was retired, and fell upon those that\nwere left behind unexpectedly, and destroyed about two thousand of them."}, "And now Cestius himself marched from Ptolemais, and came to Cesarea;\nbut he sent part of his army before him to Joppa, and gave order, that\nif they could take that city [by surprise] they should keep it; but that\nin case the citizens should perceive they were coming to attack them, that\nthey then should stay for him, and for the rest of the army. So some of\nthem made a brisk march by the sea-side, and some by land, and so coming\nupon them on both sides, they took the city with ease; and as the inhabitants\nhad made no provision beforehand for a flight, nor had gotten any thing\nready for fighting, the soldiers fell upon them, and slew them all, with\ntheir families, and then plundered and burnt the city. The number of the\nslain was eight thousand four hundred. In like manner, Cestius sent also\na considerable body of horsemen to the toparchy of Narbatene, that adjoined\nto Cesarea, who destroyed the country, and slew a great multitude of its\npeople; they also plundered what they had, and burnt their villages.", "But Cestius sent Gallus, the commander of the twelfth legion, into\nGalilee, and delivered to him as many of his forces as he supposed sufficient\nto subdue that nation. He was received by the strongest city of Galilee,\nwhich was Sepphoris, with acclamations of joy; which wise conduct of that\ncity occasioned the rest of the cities to be in quiet; while the seditious\npart and the robbers ran away to that mountain which lies in the very middle\nof Galilee, and is situated over against Sepphoris; it is called Asamon.\nSo Gallus brought his forces against them; but while those men were in\nthe superior parts above the Romans, they easily threw their darts upon\nthe Romans, as they made their approaches, and slew about two hundred of\nthem.

When the front of the Jewish\narmy had been cut off, the Jews retired into the city; but still Simon,\nthe son of Giora, fell upon the backs of the Romans, as they were ascending\nup Bethoron, and put the hindmost of the army into disorder, and carried\noff many of the beasts that carded the weapons of war, and led Shem into\nthe city. But as Cestius tarried there three days, the Jews seized upon\nthe elevated parts of the city, and set watches at the entrances into the\ncity, and appeared openly resolved not to rest when once the Romans should\nbegin to march."}, "And now when Agrippa observed that even the affairs of the Romans\nwere likely to be in danger, while such an immense multitude of their enemies\nhad seized upon the mountains round about, he determined to try what the\nJews would agree to by words, as thinking that he should either persuade\nthem all to desist from fighting, or, however, that he should cause the\nsober part of them to separate themselves from the opposite party. So he\nsent Borceus and Phebus, the persons of his party that were the best known\nto them, and promised them that Cestius should give them his right hand,\nto secure them of the Romans' entire forgiveness of what they had done\namiss, if they would throw away their arms, and come over to them; but\nthe seditious, fearing lest the whole multitude, in hopes of security to\nthemselves, should go over to Agrippa, resolved immediately to fall upon\nand kill the ambassadors; accordingly they slew Phebus before he said a\nword, but Borceus was only wounded, and so prevented his fate by flying\naway. And when the people were very angry at this, they had the seditious\nbeaten with stones and clubs, and drove them before them into the city.", "But now Cestius, observing that the disturbances that were begun\namong the Jews afforded him a proper opportunity to attack them, took his\nwhole army along with him, and put the Jews to flight, and pursued them\nto Jerusalem. He then pitched his camp upon the elevation called Scopus,\n[or watch-tower,] which was distant seven furlongs from the city; yet did\nnot he assault them in three days' time, out of expectation that those\nwithin might perhaps yield a little; and in the mean time he sent out a\ngreat many of his soldiers into neighboring villages, to seize upon their\ncorn. And on the fourth day, which was the thirtieth of the month Hyperbereteus,\n[Tisri,] when he had put his army in array, he brought it into the city.\nNow for the people, they were kept under by the seditious; but the seditious\nthemselves were greatly affrighted at the good order of the Romans, and\nretired from the suburbs, and retreated into the inner part of the city,\nand into the temple. But when Cestius was come into the city, he set the\npart called Bezetha, which is called Cenopolis, [or the new city,] on fire;\nas he did also to the timber market; after which he came into the upper\ncity, and pitched his camp over against the royal palace; and had he but\nat this very time attempted to get within the walls by force, he had won\nthe city presently, and the war had been put an end to at once; but Tyrannius\nPriseus, the muster-master of the army, and a great number of the officers\nof the horse, had been corrupted by Florus, and diverted him from that\nhis attempt; and that was the occasion that this war lasted so very long,\nand thereby the Jews were involved in such incurable calamities.", "In the mean time, many of the principal men of the city were persuaded\nby Ananus, the son of Jonathan, and invited Cestius into the city, and\nwere about to open the gates for him; but he overlooked this offer, partly\nout of his anger at the Jews, and partly because he did not thoroughly\nbelieve they were in earnest; whence it was that he delayed the matter\nso long, that the seditious perceived the treachery, and threw Ananus and\nthose of his party down from the wall, and, pelting them with stones, drove\nthem into their houses; but they stood themselves at proper distances in\nthe towers, and threw their darts at those that were getting over the wall.\nThus did the Romans make their attack against the wall for five days, but\nto no purpose. But on the next day Cestius took a great many of his choicest\nmen, and with them the archers, and attempted to break into the temple\nat the northern quarter of it; but the Jews beat them off from the cloisters,\nand repulsed them several times when they were gotten near to the wall,\ntill at length the multitude of the darts cut them off, and made them retire;\nbut the first rank of the Romans rested their shields upon the wall, and\nso did those that were behind them, and the like did those that were still\nmore backward, and guarded themselves with what they call Testudo, [the\nback of] a tortoise, upon which the darts that were thrown fell, and slided\noff without doing them any harm; so the soldiers undermined the wall, without\nbeing themselves hurt, and got all things ready for setting fire to the\ngate of the temple.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "date": {"@value": "70", "#text": "70"}, "#text": "There may another very important, and very providential, reason be here\nassigned for this strange and foolish retreat of Cestius; which, if Josephus\nhad been now a Christian, he might probably have taken notice of also;\nand that is, the affording the Jewish Christians in the city an opportunity\nof calling to mind the prediction and caution given them by Christ about\nthirty-three years and a half before, that \"when they should see the\nabomination of desolation\" [the idolatrous Roman armies, with the\nimages of their idols in their ensigns, ready to lay Jerusalem desolate]\n\"stand where it ought not;\" or, \"in the holy place;\"\nor, \"when they should see Jerusalem any one instance of a more unpolitic,\nbut more providential, compassed with armies;\" they should then \"flee\nto the mound conduct than this retreat of Cestius visible during this whole\nrains.\" By complying with which those Jewish Christians fled I siege\nof Jerusalem; which yet was providentially such a \"great to the mountains\nof Perea, and escaped this destruction.

But when the robbers perceived this\nunexpected retreat of his, they resumed their courage, and ran after the\nhinder parts of his army, and destroyed a considerable number of both their\nhorsemen and footmen; and now Cestius lay all night at the camp which was\nat Scopus; and as he went off farther next day, he thereby invited the\nenemy to follow him, who still fell upon the hindmost, and destroyed them;\nthey also fell upon the flank on each side of the army, and threw darts\nupon them obliquely, nor durst those that were hindmost turn back upon\nthose who wounded them behind, as imagining that the multitude of those\nthat pursued them was immense; nor did they venture to drive away those\nthat pressed upon them on each side, because they were heavy with their\narms, and were afraid of breaking their ranks to pieces, and because they\nsaw the Jews were light, and ready for making incursions upon them. And\nthis was the reason why the Romans suffered greatly, without being able\nto revenge themselves upon their enemies; so they were galled all the way,\nand their ranks were put into disorder, and those that were thus put out\nof their ranks were slain; among whom were Priscus, the commander of the\nsixth legion, and Longinus, the tribune, and Emilius Secundus, the commander\nof a troop of horsemen. So it was not without difficulty that they got\nto Gabao, their former camp, and that not without the loss of a great part\nof their baggage. There it was that Cestius staid two days, and was in\ngreat distress to know what he should do in these circumstances; but when\non the third day he saw a still much greater number of enemies, and all\nthe parts round about him full of Jews, he understood that his delay was\nto his own detriment, and that if he staid any longer there, he should\nhave still more enemies upon him.", "That therefore he might fly the faster, he gave orders to cast away\nwhat might hinder his army's march; so they killed the mules and other\ncreatures, excepting those that carried their darts and machines, which\nthey retained for their own use, and this principally because they were\nafraid lest the Jews should seize upon them. He then made his army march\non as far as Bethoron. Now the Jews did not so much press upon them when\nthey were in large open places; but when they were penned up in their descent\nthrough narrow passages, then did some of them get before, and hindered\nthem from getting out of them; and others of them thrust the hinder-most\ndown into the lower places; and the whole multitude extended themselves\nover against the neck of the passage, and covered the Roman army with their\ndarts. In which circumstances, as the footmen knew not how to defend themselves,\nso the danger pressed the horsemen still more, for they were so pelted,\nthat they could not march along the road in their ranks, and the ascents\nwere so high, that the cavalry were not able to march against the enemy;\nthe precipices also and valleys into which they frequently fell, and tumbled\ndown, were such on each side of them, that there was neither place for\ntheir flight, nor any contrivance could be thought of for their defense;\ntill the distress they were at last in was so great, that they betook themselves\nto lamentations, and to such mournful cries as men use in the utmost despair:\nthe joyful acclamations of the Jews also, as they encouraged one another,\nechoed the sounds back again, these last composing a noise of those that\nat once rejoiced and were in a rage. Indeed, things were come to such a\npass, that the Jews had almost taken Cestius's entire army prisoners, had\nnot the night come on, when the Romans fled to Bethoron, and the Jews seized\nupon all the places round about them, and watched for their coming out\n[in the morning].", "And then it was that Cestius, despairing of obtaining room for a\npublic march, contrived how he might best run away; and when he had selected\nfour hundred of the most courageous of his soldiers, he placed them at\nthe strongest of their fortifications, and gave order, that when they went\nup to the morning guard, they should erect their ensigns, that the Jews\nmight be made to believe that the entire army was there still, while he\nhimself took the rest of his forces with him, and marched, without any\nnoise, thirty furlongs. But when the Jews perceived, in the morning, that\nthe camp was empty, they ran upon those four hundred who had deluded them,\nand immediately threw their darts at them, and slew them; and then pursued\nafter Cestius. But he had already made use of a great part of the night\nin his flight, and still marched quicker when it was day; insomuch that\nthe soldiers, through the astonishment and fear they were in, left behind\nthem their engines for sieges, and for throwing of stones, and a great\npart of the instruments of war. So the Jews went on pursuing the Romans\nas far as Antipatris; after which, seeing they could not overtake them,\nthey came back, and took the engines, and spoiled the dead bodies, and\ngathered the prey together which the Romans had left behind them, and came\nback running and singing to their metropolis; while they had themselves\nlost a few only, but had slain of the Romans five thousand and three hundred\nfootmen, and three hundred and eighty horsemen. This defeat happened on\nthe eighth day of the month Dius, [Marchesvan,] in the twelfth year of\nthe reign of Nero.", "AFTER this calamity had befallen Cestius, many of the most eminent\nof the Jews swam away from the city, as from a ship when it was going to\nsink; Costobarus, therefore, and Saul, who were brethren, together with\nPhilip, the son of Jacimus, who was the commander of king Agrippa's forces,\nran away from the city, and went to Cestius. But then how Antipas, who\nhad been besieged with them in the king's palace, but would not fly away\nwith them, was afterward slain by the seditious, we shall relate hereafter.\nHowever, Cestius sent Saul and his friends, at their own desire, to Achaia,\nto Nero, to inform him of the great distress they were in, and to lay the\nblame of their kindling the war upon Florus, as hoping to alleviate his\nown danger, by provoking his indignation against Florus.", "In the mean time, the people of Damascus, when they were informed\nof the destruction of the Romans, set about the slaughter of those Jews\nthat were among them; and as they had them already cooped up together in\nthe place of public exercises, which they had done out of the suspicion\nthey had of them, they thought they should meet with no difficulty in the\nattempt; yet did they distrust their own wives, which were almost all of\nthem addicted to the Jewish religion; on which account it was that their\ngreatest concern was, how they might conceal these things from them; so\nthey came upon the Jews, and cut their throats, as being in a narrow place,\nin number ten thousand, and all of them unarmed, and this in one hour's\ntime, without any body to disturb them.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "From this name of Joseph the son of Gorion, or Gorion the son of Joseph,\nas B.

But when\nhe saw that Josephus was highly pleased with the activity of his temper,\nhe persuaded him, in the first place, to intrust him with the repairing\nof the walls of his native city, [Gischala,] in which work he got a great\ndeal of money from the rich citizens. He after that contrived a very shrewd\ntrick, and pretending that the Jews who dwelt in Syria were obliged to\nmake use of oil that was made by others than those of their own nation,\nhe desired leave of Josephus to send oil to their borders; so he bought\nfour amphorae with such Tyrian money as was of the value of four Attic\ndrachmae, and sold every half-amphora at the same price. And as Galilee\nwas very fruitful in oil, and was peculiarly so at that time, by sending\naway great quantities, and having the sole privilege so to do, he gathered\nan immense sum of money together, which money he immediately used to the\ndisadvantage of him who gave him that privilege; and, as he supposed, that\nif he could once overthrow Josephus, he should himself obtain the government\nof Galilee; so he gave orders to the robbers that were under his command\nto be more zealous in their thievish expeditions, that by the rise of many\nthat desired innovations in the country, he might either catch their general\nin his snares, as he came to the country's assistance, and then kill him;\nor if he should overlook the robbers, he might accuse him for his negligence\nto the people of the country. He also spread abroad a report far and near\nthat Josephus was delivering up the administration of affairs to the Romans;\nand many such plots did he lay, in order to ruin him.", "Now at the same time that certain young men of the village Dabaritta,\nwho kept guard in the Great Plain laid snares for Ptolemy, who was Agrippa's\nand Bernice's steward, and took from him all that he had with him; among\nwhich things there were a great many costly garments, and no small number\nof silver cups, and six hundred pieces of gold; yet were they not able\nto conceal what they had stolen, but brought it all to Josephus, to Tarichee.\nHereupon he blamed them for the violence they had offered to the king and\nqueen, and deposited what they brought to him with Eneas, the most potent\nman of Taricheae, with an intention of sending the things back to the owners\nat a proper time; which act of Josephus brought him into the greatest danger;\nfor those that had stolen the things had an indignation at him, both because\nthey gained no share of it for themselves, and because they perceived beforehand\nwhat was Josephus's intention, and that he would freely deliver up what\nhad cost them so much pains to the king and queen. These ran away by night\nto their several villages, and declared to all men that Josephus was going\nto betray them: they also raised great disorders in all the neighboring\ncities, insomuch that in the morning a hundred thousand armed men came\nrunning together; which multitude was crowded together in the hippodrome\nat Taricheae, and made a very peevish clamor against him; while some cried\nout, that they should depose the traitor; and others, that they should\nburn him. Now John irritated a great many, as did also one Jesus, the son\nof Sapphias, who was then governor of Tiberias. Then it was that Josephus's\nfriends, and the guards of his body, were so affrighted at this violent\nassault of the multitude, that they all fled away but four; and as he was\nasleep, they awaked him, as the people were going to set fire to the house.\nAnd although those four that remained with him persuaded him to run away,\nhe was neither surprised at his being himself deserted, nor at the great\nmultitude that came against him, but leaped out to them with his clothes\nrent, and ashes sprinkled on his head, with his hands behind him, and his\nsword hanging at his neck. At this sight his friends, especially those\nof Tarichae, commiserated his condition; but those that came out of the\ncountry, and those in their neighborhood, to whom his government seemed\nburdensome, reproached him, and bid him produce the money which belonged\nto them all immediately, and to confess the agreement he had made to betray\nthem; for they imagined, from the habit in which he appeared, that he would\ndeny nothing of what they suspected concerning him, and that it was in\norder to obtain pardon that he had put himself entirely into so pitiable\na posture. But this humble appearance was only designed as preparatory\nto a stratagem of his, who thereby contrived to set those that were so\nangry at him at variance one with another about the things they were angry\nat. However, he promised he would confess all: hereupon he was permitted\nto speak, when he said,\" I did neither intend to send this money back\nto Agrippa, nor to gain it myself; for I did never esteem one that was\nyour enemy to be my friend, nor did I look upon what would tend to your\ndisadvantage to be my advantage. But, O you people of Tariehete, I saw\nthat your city stood in more need than others of fortifications for your\nsecurity, and that it wanted money in order for the building it a wall.\nI was also afraid lest the people of Tiberias and other cities should lay\na plot to seize upon these spoils, and therefore it was that I intended\nto retain this money privately, that I might encompass you with a wall.\nBut if this does not please you, I will produce what was brought me, and\nleave it to you to plunder it; but if I have conducted myself so well as\nto please you, you may if you please punish your benefactor.\"", "Hereupon the people of Taricheae loudly commended him; but those\nof Tiberias, with the rest of the company, gave him hard names, and threatened\nwhat they would do to him; so both sides left off quarrelling with Josephus,\nand fell on quarrelling with one another. So he grew bold upon the dependence\nhe had on his friends, which were the people of Taricheae, and about forty\nthousand in number, and spake more freely to the whole multitude, and reproached\nthem greatly for their rashness; and told them, that with this money he\nwould build walls about Taricheae, and would put the other cities in a\nstate of security also; for that they should not want money, if they would\nbut agree for whose benefit it was to be procured, and would not suffer\nthemselves to be irritated against him who procured it for them.", "Hereupon the rest of the multitude that had been deluded retired;\nbut yet so that they went away angry, and two thousand of them made an\nassault upon him in their armor; and as he was already gone to his own\nhouse, they stood without and threatened him. On which occasion Josephus\nagain used a second stratagem to escape them; for he got upon the top of\nhis house, and with his right hand desired them to be silent, and said\nto them, \"I cannot tell what you would have, nor can hear what you\nsay, for the confused noise you make;\" but he said that he would comply\nwith all their demands, in case they would but send some of their number\nin to him that might talk with him about it. And when the principal of\nthem, with their leaders, heard this, they came into the house. He then\ndrew them to the most retired part of the house, and shut the door of that\nhall where he put them, and then had them whipped till every one of their\ninward parts appeared naked. In the mean time the multitude stood round\nthe house, and supposed that he had a long discourse with those that were\ngone in about what they claimed of him. He had then the doors set open\nimmediately, and sent the men out all bloody, which so terribly aftrighted\nthose that had before threatened him, that they threw away their arms and\nran away.", "But as for John, his envy grew greater [upon this escape of Josephus],\nand he framed a new plot against him; he pretended to be sick, and by a\nletter desired that Josephus would give him leave to use the hot baths\nthat were at Tiberias, for the recovery of his health. Hereupon Josephus,\nwho hitherto suspected nothing of John's plots against him, wrote to the\ngovernors of the city, that they would provide a lodging and necessaries\nfor John; which favors, when he had made use of, in two days' time he did\nwhat he came about; some he corrupted with delusive frauds, and others\nwith money, and so persuaded them to revolt from Josephus. This Silas,\nwho was appointed guardian of the city by Josephus, wrote to him immediately,\nand informed him of the plot against him; which epistle when Josephus had\nreceived, he marched with great diligence all night, and came early in\nthe morning to Tiberias; at which time the rest of the multitude met him.\nBut John, who suspected that his coming was not for his advantage, sent\nhowever one of his friends, and pretended that he was sick, and that being\nconfined to his bed, he could not come to pay him his respects. But as\nsoon as Josephus had got the people of Tiberias together in the stadium,\nand tried to discourse with them about the letters that he had received,\nJohn privately sent some armed men, and gave them orders to slay him. But\nwhen the people saw that the armed men were about to draw their swords,\nthey cried out; at which cry Josephus turned himself about, and when he\nsaw that the swords were just at his throat, he marched away in great haste\nto the sea-shore, and left off that speech which he was going to make to\nthe people, upon an elevation of six cubits high. He then seized on a ship\nwhich lay in the haven, and leaped into it, with two of his guards, and\nfled away into the midst of the lake.", "But now the soldiers he had with him took up their arms immediately,\nand marched against the plotters; but Josephus was afraid lest a civil\nwar should be raised by the envy of a few men, and bring the city to ruin;\nso he sent some of his party to tell them, that they should do no more\nthan provide for their own safety; that they should not kill any body,\nnor accuse any for the occasion they had afforded [of disorder]. Accordingly,\nthese men obeyed his orders, and were quiet; but the people of the neighboring\ncountry, when they were informed of this plot, and of the plotter, they\ngot together in great multitudes to oppose John. But he prevented their\nattempt, and fled away to Gischala, his native city, while the Galileans\ncame running out of their several cities to Josephus; and as they were\nnow become many ten thousands of armed men, they cried out, that they were\ncome against John the common plotter against their interest, and would\nat the same time burn him, and that city which had received him. Hereupon\nJosephus told them that he took their good-will to him kindly, but still\nhe restrained their fury, and intended to subdue his enemies by prudent\nconduct, rather than by slaying them; so he excepted those of every city\nwhich had joined in this revolt with John, by name, who had readily been\nshown him by these that came from every city, and caused public proclamation\nto be made, that he would seize upon the effects of those that did not\nforsake John within five days' time, and would burn both their houses and\ntheir families with fire. Whereupon three thousand of John's party left\nhim immediately, who came to Josephus, and threw their arms down at his\nfeet. John then betook himself, together with his two thousand Syrian runagates,\nfrom open attempts, to more secret ways of treachery. Accordingly, he privately\nsent messengers to Jerusalem, to accuse Josephus, as having to great power,\nand to let them know that he would soon come as a tyrant to their metropolis,\nunless they prevented him. This accusation the people were aware of beforehand,\nbut had no regard to it. However, some of the grandees, out of envy, and\nsome of the rulers also, sent money to John privately, that he might be\nable to get together mercenary soldiers, in order to fight Josephus; they\nalso made a decree of themselves, and this for recalling him from his government,\nyet did they not think that decree sufficient; so they sent withal two\nthousand five hundred armed men, and four persons of the highest rank amongst\nthem; Joazar the son of Nomicus, and Ananias the son of Sadduk, as also\nSimon and Judas the sons of Jonathan, all very able men in speaking, that\nthese persons might withdraw the good-will of the people from Josephus.\nThese had it in charge, that if he would voluntarily come away, they should\npermit him to [come and] give an account of his conduct; but if he obstinately\ninsisted upon continuing in his government, they should treat him as an\nenemy. Now Josephus's friends had sent him word that an army was coming\nagainst him, but they gave him no notice beforehand what the reason of\ntheir coming was, that being only known among some secret councils of his\nenemies; and by this means it was that four cities revolted from him immediately,\nSepphoris, and Gamala, and Gischala, and Tiberias. Yet did he recover these\ncities without war; and when he had routed those four commanders by stratagems,\nand had taken the most potent of their warriors, he sent them to Jerusalem;\nand the people [of Galilee] had great indignation at them, and were in\na zealous disposition to slay, not only these forces, but those that sent\nthem also, had not these forces prevented it by running away.", "Now John was detained afterward within the walls of Gischala, by\nthe fear he was in of Josephus; but within a few days Tiberias revolted\nagain, the people within it inviting king Agrippa [to return to the exercise\nof his authority there]. And when he did not come at the time appointed,\nand when a few Roman horsemen appeared that day, they expelled Josephus\nout of the city. Now this revolt of theirs was presently known at Taricheae;\nand as Josephus had sent out all the soldiers that were with him to gather\ncorn, he knew not how either to march out alone against the revolters,\nor to stay where he was, because he was afraid the king's soldiers might\nprevent him if he tarried, and might get into the city; for he did not\nintend to do any thing on the next day, because it was the sabbath day,\nand would hinder his proceeding. So he contrived to circumvent the revolters\nby a stratagem; and in the first place he ordered the gates of Taricheae\nto be shut, that nobody might go out and inform [those of Tiberias], for\nwhom it was intended, what stratagem he was about; he then got together\nall the ships that were upon the lake, which were found to be two hundred\nand thirty, and in each of them he put no more than four mariners. So he\nsailed to Tiberias with haste, and kept at such a distance from the city,\nthat it was not easy for the people to see the vessels, and ordered that\nthe empty vessels should float up and down there, while himself, who had\nbut seven of his guards with him, and those unarmed also, went so near\nas to be seen; but when his adversaries, who were still reproaching him,\nsaw him from the walls, they were so astonished that they supposed all\nthe ships were full of armed men, and threw down their arms, and by signals\nof intercession they besought him to spare the city.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "I cannot but think this stratagem of Josephus, which is related both here\nand in his Life, sect. 32, 33, to be one of the finest that ever was invented\nand executed by any warrior whatsoever."}, "#text": "Upon this Josephus threatened them terribly, and reproached them,\nthat when they were the first that took up arms against the Romans, they\nshould spend their force beforehand in civil dissensions, and do what their\nenemies desired above all things; and that besides they should endeavor\nso hastily to seize upon him, who took care of their safety, and had not\nbeen ashamed to shut the gates of their city against him that built their\nwalls; that, however, he would admit of any intercessors from them that\nmight make some excuse for them, and with whom he would make such agreements\nas might be for the city's security. Hereupon ten of the most potent men\nof Tiberias came down to him presently; and when he had taken them into\none of his vessels, he ordered them to be carried a great way off from\nthe city. He then commanded that fifty others of their senate, such as\nwere men of the greatest eminence, should come to him, that they also might\ngive him some security on their behalf. After which, under one new pretense\nor another, he called forth others, one after another, to make the leagues\nbetween them. He then gave order to the masters of those vessels which\nhe had thus filled to sail away immediately for Taricheae, and to confine\nthose men in the prison there; till at length he took all their senate,\nconsisting of six hundred persons, and about two thousand of the populace,\nand carried them away to Taricheae."}, "And when the rest of the people cried out, that it was one Clitus\nthat was the chief author of this revolt, they desired him to spend his\nanger upon him [only]; but Josephus, whose intention it was to slay nobody,\ncommanded one Levius, belonging to his guards, to go out of the vessel,\nin order to cut off both Clitus's hands; yet was Levius afraid to go out\nby himself alone to such a large body of enemies, and refused to go. Now\nClitus saw that Josephus was in a great passion in the ship, and ready\nto leap out of it, in order to execute the punishment himself; he begged\ntherefore from the shore, that he would leave him one of his hands; which\nJosephus agreed to, upon condition that he would himself cutoff the other\nhand; accordingly he drew his sword, and with his right hand cut off his\nleft, so great was the fear he was in of Josephus himself. And thus he\ntook the people of Tiberias prisoners, and recovered the city again with\nempty ships and seven of his guard. Moreover, a few days afterward he retook\nGischala, which had revolted with the people of Sepphoris, and gave his\nsoldiers leave to plunder it; yet did he get all the plunder together,\nand restored it to the inhabitants; and the like he did to the inhabitants\nof Sepphoris and Tiberias. For when he had subdued those cities, he had\na mind, by letting them be plundered, to give them some good instruction,\nwhile at the same time he regained their good-will by restoring them their\nmoney again.", "AND thus were the disturbances of Galilee quieted, when, upon their\nceasing to prosecute their civil dissensions, they betook themselves to\nmake preparations for the war with the Romans. Now in Jerusalem the high\npriest Artanus, and do as many of the men of power as were not in the interest\nof the Romans, both repaired the walls, and made a great many warlike instruments,\ninsomuch that in all parts of the city darts and all sorts of armor were\nupon the anvil. Although the multitude of the young men were engaged in\nexercises, without any regularity, and all places were full of tumultuous\ndoings; yet the moderate sort were exceedingly sad; and a great many there\nwere who, out of the prospect they had of the calamities that were coming\nupon them, made great lamentations. There were also such omens observed\nas were understood to be forerunners of evils by such as loved peace, but\nwere by those that kindled the war interpreted so as to suit their own\ninclinations; and the very state of the city, even before the Romans came\nagainst it, was that of a place doomed to destruction. However, Ananus's\nconcern was this, to lay aside, for a while, the preparations for the war,\nand to persuade the seditious to consult their own interest, and to restrain\nthe madness of those that had the name of zealots; but their violence was\ntoo hard for him; and what end he came to we shall relate hereafter.", "But as for the Acrabbene toparchy, Simon, the son of Gioras, got\na great number of those that were fond of innovations together, and betook\nhimself to ravage the country; nor did he only harass the rich men's houses,\nbut tormented their bodies, and appeared openly and beforehand to affect\ntyranny in his government. And when an army was sent against him by Artanus,\nand the other rulers, he and his band retired to the robbers that were\nat Masada, and staid there, and plundered the country of Idumea with them,\ntill both Ananus and his other adversaries were slain; and until the rulers\nof that country were so afflicted with the multitude of those that were\nslain, and with the continual ravage of what they had, that they raised\nan army, and put garrisons into the villages, to secure them from those\ninsults. And in this state were the affairs of Judea at that time."]}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "3", "head": "Book III", "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "sum", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "CONTAINING THE INTERVAL OF ABOUT ONE YEAR.\nFROM VESPASIAN'S COMING TO SUBDUE THE JEWS TO THE TAKING\nOF GAMALA."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "sum", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "VESPASIAN IS SENT INTO SYRIA BY NERO IN ORDER TO MAKE WAR\nWITH THE JEWS."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "sum", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "A GREAT SLAUGHTER ABOUT ASCALON.

Upon the whole,\nhe sent this man to take upon him the command of the armies that were in\nSyria; but this not without great encomiums and flattering compellations,\nsuch as necessity required, and such as might mollify him into complaisance.\nSo Vespasian sent his son Titus from Achaia, where he had been with Nero,\nto Alexandria, to bring back with him from thence the fifth and. the tenth\nlegions, while he himself, when he had passed over the Hellespont, came\nby land into Syria, where he gathered together the Roman forces, with a\nconsiderable number of auxiliaries from the kings in that neighborhood.", "Now the Jews, after they had beaten Cestius, were so much elevated\nwith their unexpected success, that they could not govern their zeal, but,\nlike people blown up into a flame by their good fortune, carried the war\nto remoter places. Accordingly, they presently got together a great multitude\nof all their most hardy soldiers, and marched away for Ascalon. This is\nan ancient city that is distant from Jerusalem five hundred and twenty\nfurlongs, and was always an enemy to the Jews; on which account they determined\nto make their first effort against it, and to make their approaches to\nit as near as possible. This excursion was led on by three men, who were\nthe chief of them all, both for strength and sagacity; Niger, called the\nPersite, Silas of Babylon, and besides them John the Essene. Now Ascalon\nwas strongly walled about, but had almost no assistance to be relied on\n[near them], for the garrison consisted of one cohort of footmen, and one\ntroop of horsemen, whose captain was Antonius.", "These Jews, therefore, out of their anger, marched faster than ordinary,\nand, as if they had come but a little way, approached very near the city,\nand were come even to it; but Antonius, who was not unapprized of the attack\nthey were going to make upon the city, drew out his horsemen beforehand,\nand being neither daunted at the multitude, nor at the courage of the enemy,\nreceived their first attacks with great bravery; and when they crowded\nto the very walls, he beat them off. Now the Jews were unskillful in war,\nbut were to fight with those who were skillful therein; they were footmen\nto fight with horsemen; they were in disorder, to fight those that were\nunited together; they were poorly armed, to fight those that were completely\nso; they were to fight more by their rage than by sober counsel, and were\nexposed to soldiers that were exactly obedient; and did every thing they\nwere bidden upon the least intimation. So they were easily beaten; for\nas soon as ever their first ranks were once in disorder, they were put\nto flight by the enemy's cavalry, and those of them that came behind such\nas crowded to the wall fell upon their own party's weapons, and became\none another's enemies; and this so long till they were all forced to give\nway to the attacks of the horsemen, and were dispersed all the plain over,\nwhich plain was wide, and all fit for the horsemen; which circumstance\nwas very commodious for the Romans, and occasioned the slaughter of the\ngreatest number of the Jews; for such as ran away, they could overrun them,\nand make them turn back; and when they had brought them back after their\nflight, and driven them together, they ran them through, and slew a vast\nnumber of them, insomuch that others encompassed others of them, and drove\nthem before them whithersoever they turned themselves, and slew them easily\nwith their arrows; and the great number there were of the Jews seemed a\nsolitude to themselves, by reason of the distress they were in, while the\nRomans had such good success with their small number, that they seemed\nto themselves to be the greater multitude. And as the former strove zealously\nunder their misfortunes, out of the shame of a sudden flight, and hopes\nof the change in their success, so did the latter feel no weariness by\nreason of their good fortune; insomuch that the fight lasted till the evening,\ntill ten thousand men of the Jews' side lay dead, with two of their generals,\nJohn and Silas, and the greater part of the remainder were wounded, with\nNiger, their remaining general, who fled away together to a small city\nof Idumea, called Sallis. Some few also of the Romans were wounded in this\nbattle.", "Yet were not the spirits of the Jews broken by so great a calamity,\nbut the losses they had sustained rather quickened their resolution for\nother attempts; for, overlooking the dead bodies which lay under their\nfeet, they were enticed by their former glorious actions to venture on\na second destruction; so when they had lain still so little a while that\ntheir wounds were not yet thoroughly cured, they got together all their\nforces, and came with greater fury, and in much greater numbers, to Ascalon.\nBut their former ill fortune followed them, as the consequence of their\nunskilfulness, and other deficiencies in war; for Antonius laid ambushes\nfor them in the passages they were to go through, where they fell into\nsnares unexpectedly, and where they were encompassed about with horsemen,\nbefore they could form themselves into a regular body for fighting, and\nwere above eight thousand of them slain; so all the rest of them ran away,\nand with them Niger, who still did a great many bold exploits in his flight.\nHowever, they were driven along together by the enemy, who pressed hard\nupon them, into a certain strong tower belonging to a village called Bezedeh\nHowever, Antonius and his party, that they might neither spend any considerable\ntime about this tower, which was hard to be taken, nor suffer their commander,\nand the most courageous man of them all, to escape from them, they set\nthe wall on fire; and as the tower was burning, the Romans went away rejoicing,\nas taking it for granted that Niger was destroyed; but he leaped out of\nthe tower into a subterraneous cave, in the innermost part of it, and was\npreserved; and on the third day afterward he spake out of the ground to\nthose that with great lamentation were searching for him, in order to give\nhim a decent funeral; and when he was come out, he filled all the Jews\nwith an unexpected joy, as though he were preserved by God's providence\nto be their commander for the time to come.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Spanheim\nand Reland both agree, that the two cities here esteemed greater than Antioch,\nthe metropolis of Syria, were Rome and Alexandria; nor is there any occasion\nfor doubt in so plain a case."}, "#text": "And now Vespasian took along with him his army from Antioch, (which\nis the metropolis of Syria, and without dispute deserves the place of the\nthird city in the habitable earth that was under the Roman empire, \nboth in magnitude, and other marks of prosperity,) where he found king\nAgrippa, with all his forces, waiting for his coming, and marched to Ptolemais.\nAt this city also the inhabitants of Sepphoris of Galilee met him, who\nwere for peace with the Romans. These citizens had beforehand taken care\nof their own safety, and being sensible of the power of the Romans, they\nhad been with Cestius Gallus before Vespasian came, and had given their\nfaith to him, and received the security of his right hand, and had received\na Roman garrison; and at this time withal they received Vespasian, the\nRoman general, very kindly, and readily promised that they would assist\nhim against their own countrymen. Now the general delivered them, at their\ndesire, as many horsemen and footmen as he thought sufficient to oppose\nthe incursions of the Jews, if they should come against them.

Moreover, the cities lie\nhere very thick, and the very many villages there are here are every where\nso full of people, by the richness of their soil, that the very least of\nthem contain above fifteen thousand inhabitants.", "In short, if any one will suppose that Galilee is inferior to Perea\nin magnitude, he will be obliged to prefer it before it in its strength;\nfor this is all capable of cultivation, and is every where fruitful; but\nfor Perea, which is indeed much larger in extent, the greater part of it\nis desert and rough, and much less disposed for the production of the milder\nkinds of fruits; yet hath it a moist soil [in other parts], and produces\nall kinds of fruits, and its plains are planted with trees of all sorts,\nwhile yet the olive tree, the vine, and the palm tree are chiefly cultivated\nthere. It is also sufficiently watered with torrents, which issue out of\nthe mountains, and with springs that never fail to run, even when the torrents\nfail them, as they do in the dog-days. Now the length of Perea is from\nMacherus to Pella, and its breadth from Philadelphia to Jordan; its northern\nparts are bounded by Pella, as we have already said, as well as its Western\nwith Jordan; the land of Moab is its southern border, and its eastern limits\nreach to Arabia, and Silbonitis, and besides to Philadelphene and Gerasa.", "Now as to the country of Samaria, it lies between Judea and Galilee;\nit begins at a village that is in the great plain called Ginea, and ends\nat the Acrabbene toparchy, and is entirely of the same nature with Judea;\nfor both countries are made up of hills and valleys, and are moist enough\nfor agriculture, and are very fruitful. They have abundance of trees, and\nare full of autumnal fruit, both that which grows wild, and that which\nis the effect of cultivation. They are not naturally watered by many rivers,\nbut derive their chief moisture from rain-water, of which they have no\nwant; and for those rivers which they have, all their waters are exceeding\nsweet: by reason also of the excellent grass they have, their cattle yield\nmore milk than do those in other places; and, what is the greatest sign\nof excellency and of abundance, they each of them are very full of people.", "In the limits of Samaria and Judea lies the village Anuath, which\nis also named Borceos. This is the northern boundary of Judea. The southern\nparts of Judea, if they be measured lengthways, are bounded by a Village\nadjoining to the confines of Arabia; the Jews that dwell there call it\nJordan. However, its breadth is extended from the river Jordan to Joppa.\nThe city Jerusalem is situated in the very middle; on which account some\nhave, with sagacity enough, called that city the Navel of the country.\nNor indeed is Judea destitute of such delights as come from the sea, since\nits maritime places extend as far as Ptolemais: it was parted into eleven\nportions, of which the royal city Jerusalem was the supreme, and presided\nover all the neighboring country, as the head does over the body. As to\nthe other cities that were inferior to it, they presided over their several\ntoparchies; Gophna was the second of those cities, and next to that Acrabatta,\nafter them Thamna, and Lydda, and Emmaus, and Pella, and Idumea, and Engaddi,\nand Herodium, and Jericho; and after them came Jamnia and Joppa, as presiding\nover the neighboring people; and besides these there was the region of\nGamala, and Gaulonitis, and Batanea, and Trachonitis, which are also parts\nof the kingdom of Agrippa. This [last] country begins at Mount Libanus,\nand the fountains of Jordan, and reaches breadthways to the lake of Tiberias;\nand in length is extended from a village called Arpha, as far as Julias.\nIts inhabitants are a mixture of Jews and Syrians. And thus have I, with\nall possible brevity, described the country of Judea, and those that lie\nround about it.", "NOW the auxiliaries which were sent to assist the people of Sepphoris,\nbeing a thousand horsemen, and six thousand footmen, under Placidus the\ntribune, pitched their camp in two bodies in the great plain. The foot\nwere put into the city to be a guard to it, but the horse lodged abroad\nin the camp. These last, by marching continually one way or other, and\noverrunning the parts of the adjoining country, were very troublesome to\nJosephus and his men; they also plundered all the places that were out\nof the city's liberty, and intercepted such as durst go abroad. On this\naccount it was that Josephus marched against the city, as hoping to take\nwhat he had lately encompassed with so strong a wall, before they revolted\nfrom the rest of the Galileans, that the Romans would have much ado to\ntake it; by which means he proved too weak, and failed of his hopes, both\nas to the forcing the place, and as to his prevailing with the people of\nSepphoris to deliver it up to him. By this means he provoked the Romans\nto treat the country according to the law of war; nor did the Romans, out\nof the anger they bore at this attempt, leave off, either by night or by\nday, burning the places in the plain, and stealing away the cattle that\nwere in the country, and killing whatsoever appeared capable of fighting\nperpetually, and leading the weaker people as slaves into captivity; so\nthat Galilee was all over filled with fire and blood; nor was it exempted\nfrom any kind of misery or calamity, for the only refuge they had was this,\nthat when they were pursued, they could retire to the cities which had\nwalls built them by Josephus.", "But as to Titus, he sailed over from Achaia to Alexandria, and that\nsooner than the winter season did usually permit; so he took with him those\nforces he was sent for, and marching with great expedition, he came suddenly\nto Ptolemais, and there finding his father, together with the two legions,\nthe fifth and the tenth, which were the most eminent legions of all, he\njoined them to that fifteenth legion which was with his father; eighteen\ncohorts followed these legions; there came also five cohorts from Cesarea,\nwith one troop of horsemen, and five other troops of horsemen from Syria.\nNow these ten cohorts had severally a thousand footmen, but the other thirteen\ncohorts had no more than six hundred footmen apiece, with a hundred and\ntwenty horsemen. There were also a considerable number of auxiliaries got\ntogether, that came from the kings Antiochus, and Agrippa, and Sohemus,\neach of them contributing one thousand footmen that were archers, and a\nthousand horsemen. Malchus also, the king of Arabia, sent a thousand horsemen,\nbesides five thousand footmen, the greatest part of which were archers;\nso that the whole army, including the auxiliaries sent by the kings, as\nwell horsemen as footmen, when all were united together, amounted to sixty\nthousand, besides the servants, who, as they followed in vast numbers,\nso because they had been trained up in war with the rest, ought not to\nbe distinguished from the fighting men; for as they were in their masters'\nservice in times of peace, so did they undergo the like dangers with them\nin times of war, insomuch that they were inferior to none, either in skill\nor in strength, only they were subject to their masters.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This\ndescription of the exact symmetry and regularity of the Roman army, and\nof the Roman encampments, with the sounding their trumpets, etc. and order\nof war, described in this and the next chapter, is so very like to the\nsymmetry and regularity of the people of Israel in the wilderness, (see\nDescription of the Temples, ch. 9.,) that one cannot well avoid the supposal,\nthat the one was the ultimate pattern of the other, and that the tactics\nof the ancients were taken from the rules given by God to Moses.

And, indeed, if any one does but attend to the other\nparts of their military discipline, he will be forced to confess that their\nobtaining so large a dominion hath been the acquisition of their valor,\nand not the bare gift of fortune; for they do not begin to use their weapons\nfirst in time of war, nor do they then put their hands first into motion,\nwhile they avoided so to do in times of peace; but, as if their weapons\ndid always cling to them, they have never any truce from warlike exercises;\nnor do they stay till times of war admonish them to use them; for their\nmilitary exercises differ not at all from the real use of their arms, but\nevery soldier is every day exercised, and that with great diligence, as\nif it were in time of war, which is the reason why they bear the fatigue\nof battles so easily; for neither can any disorder remove them from their\nusual regularity, nor can fear affright them out of it, nor can labor tire\nthem; which firmness of conduct makes them always to overcome those that\nhave not the same firmness; nor would he be mistaken that should call those\ntheir exercises unbloody battles, and their battles bloody exercises. Nor\ncan their enemies easily surprise them with the suddenness of their incursions;\nfor as soon as they have marched into an enemy's land, they do not begin\nto fight till they have walled their camp about; nor is the fence they\nraise rashly made, or uneven; nor do they all abide ill it, nor do those\nthat are in it take their places at random; but if it happens that the\nground is uneven, it is first leveled: their camp is also four-square by\nmeasure, and carpenters are ready, in great numbers, with their tools,\nto erect their buildings for them."}, "As for what is within the camp, it is set apart for tents, but the\noutward circumference hath the resemblance to a wall, and is adorned with\ntowers at equal distances, where between the towers stand the engines for\nthrowing arrows and darts, and for slinging stones, and where they lay\nall other engines that can annoy the enemy, all ready for their several\noperations. They also erect four gates, one at every side of the circumference,\nand those large enough for the entrance of the beasts, and wide enough\nfor making excursions, if occasion should require. They divide the camp\nwithin into streets, very conveniently, and place the tents of the commanders\nin the middle; but in the very midst of all is the general's own tent,\nin the nature of a temple, insomuch, that it appears to be a city built\non the sudden, with its market-place, and place for handicraft trades,\nand with seats for the officers superior and inferior, where, if any differences\narise, their causes are heard and determined. The camp, and all that is\nin it, is encompassed with a wall round about, and that sooner than one\nwould imagine, and this by the multitude and the skill of the laborers;\nand, if occasion require, a trench is drawn round the whole, whose depth\nis four cubits, and its breadth equal.", "When they have thus secured themselves, they live together by companies,\nwith quietness and decency, as are all their other affairs managed with\ngood order and security. Each company hath also their wood, and their corn,\nand their water brought them, when they stand in need of them; for they\nneither sup nor dine as they please themselves singly, but all together.\nTheir times also for sleeping, and watching, and rising are notified beforehand\nby the sound of trumpets, nor is any thing done without such a signal;\nand in the morning the soldiery go every one to their centurions, and these\ncenturions to their tribunes, to salute them; with whom all the superior\nofficers go to the general of the whole army, who then gives them of course\nthe watchword and other orders, to be by them cared to all that are under\ntheir command; which is also observed when they go to fight, and thereby\nthey turn themselves about on the sudden, when there is occasion for making\nsallies, as they come back when they are recalled in crowds also.", "Now when they are to go out of their camp, the trumpet gives a sound,\nat which time nobody lies still, but at the first intimation they take\ndown their tents, and all is made ready for their going out; then do the\ntrumpets sound again, to order them to get ready for the march; then do\nthey lay their baggage suddenly upon their mules, and other beasts of burden,\nand stand, as at the place of starting, ready to march; when also they\nset fire to their camp, and this they do because it will be easy for them\nto erect another camp, and that it may not ever be of use to their enemies.\nThen do the trumpets give a sound the third time, that they are to go out,\nin order to excite those that on any account are a little tardy, that so\nno one may be out of his rank when the army marches. Then does the crier\nstand at the general's right hand, and asks them thrice, in their own tongue,\nwhether they be now ready to go out to war or not? To which they reply\nas often, with a loud and cheerful voice, saying, \"We are ready.\"\nAnd this they do almost before the question is asked them: they do this\nas filled with a kind of martial fury, and at the same time that they so\ncry out, they lift up their right hands also.", "When, after this, they are gone out of their camp, they all march\nwithout noise, and in a decent manner, and every one keeps his own rank,\nas if they were going to war. The footmen are armed with breastplates and\nhead-pieces, and have swords on each side; but the sword which is upon\ntheir left side is much longer than the other, for that on the right side\nis not longer than a span.

The horsemen have a long sword on their right\nsides, axed a long pole in their hand; a shield also lies by them obliquely\non one side of their horses, with three or more darts that are borne in\ntheir quiver, having broad points, and not smaller than spears. They have\nalso head-pieces and breastplates, in like manner as have all the footmen.\nAnd for those that are chosen to be about the general, their armor no way\ndiffers from that of the horsemen belonging to other troops; and he always\nleads the legions forth to whom the lot assigns that employment.", "This is the manner of the marching and resting of the Romans, as\nalso these are the several sorts of weapons they use. But when they are\nto fight, they leave nothing without forecast, nor to be done off-hand,\nbut counsel is ever first taken before any work is begun, and what hath\nbeen there resolved upon is put in execution presently; for which reason\nthey seldom commit any errors; and if they have been mistaken at any time,\nthey easily correct those mistakes. They also esteem any errors they commit\nupon taking counsel beforehand to be better than such rash success as is\nowing to fortune only; because such a fortuitous advantage tempts them\nto be inconsiderate, while consultation, though it may sometimes fail of\nsuccess, hath this good in it, that it makes men more careful hereafter;\nbut for the advantages that arise from chance, they are not owing to him\nthat gains them; and as to what melancholy accidents happen unexpectedly,\nthere is this comfort in them, that they had however taken the best consultations\nthey could to prevent them.", "Now they so manage their preparatory exercises of their weapons,\nthat not the bodies of the soldiers only, but their souls may also become\nstronger: they are moreover hardened for war by fear; for their laws inflict\ncapital punishments, not only for soldiers running away from the ranks,\nbut for slothfulness and inactivity, though it be but in a lesser degree;\nas are their generals more severe than their laws, for they prevent any\nimputation of cruelty toward those under condemnation, by the great rewards\nthey bestow on the valiant soldiers; and the readiness of obeying their\ncommanders is so great, that it is very ornamental in peace; but when they\ncome to a battle, the whole army is but one body, so well coupled together\nare their ranks, so sudden are their turnings about, so sharp their hearing\nas to what orders are given them, so quick their sight of the ensigns,\nand so nimble are their hands when they set to work; whereby it comes to\npass that what they do is done quickly, and what they suffer they bear\nwith the greatest patience. Nor can we find any examples where they have\nbeen conquered in battle, when they came to a close fight, either by the\nmultitude of the enemies, or by their stratagems, or by the difficulties\nin the places they were in; no, nor by fortune neither, for their victories\nhave been surer to them than fortune could have granted them. In a case,\ntherefore, where counsel still goes before action, and where, after taking\nthe best advice, that advice is followed by so active an army, what wonder\nis it that Euphrates on the east, the ocean on the west, the most fertile\nregions of Libya on the south, and the Danube and the Rhine on the north,\nare the limits of this empire? One might well say that the Roman possessions\nare not inferior to the Romans themselves.", "This account I have given the reader, not so much with the intention\nof commending the Romans, as of comforting those that have been conquered\nby them, and for the deterring others from attempting innovations under\ntheir government. This discourse of the Roman military conduct may also\nperhaps be of use to such of the curious as are ignorant of it, and yet\nhave a mind to know it.

So they\nfought the Romans briskly when they least expected it, being both many\nin number, and prepared for fighting, and of great alacrity, as esteeming\ntheir country, their wives, and their children to be in danger, and easily\nput the Romans to flight, and wounded many of them, and slew seven of them;\n because\ntheir retreat was not made in a disorderly manner, be-cause the strokes\nonly touched the surface of their bodies, which were covered with their\narmor in all parts, and because the Jews did rather throw their weapons\nupon them from a great distance, than venture to come hand to hand with\nthem, and had only light armor on, while the others were completely armed.\nHowever, three men of the Jews' side were slain, and a few wounded; so\nPlacidus, finding himself unable to assault the city, ran away."}, "But as Vespasian had a great mind to fall upon Galilee, he marched\nout of Ptolemais, having put his army into that order wherein the Romans\nused to march. He ordered those auxiliaries which were lightly armed, and\nthe archers, to march first, that they might prevent any sudden insults\nfrom the enemy, and might search out the woods that looked suspiciously,\nand were capable of ambuscades. Next to these followed that part of the\nRomans which was completely armed, both footmen ,and horsemen. Next to\nthese followed ten out of every hundred, carrying along with them their\narms, and what was necessary to measure out a camp withal; and after them,\nsuch as were to make the road even and straight, and if it were any where\nrough and hard to be passed over, to plane it, and to cut down the woods\nthat hindered their march, that the army might not be in distress, or tired\nwith their march. Behind these he set such carriages of the army as belonged\nboth to himself and to the other commanders, with a considerable number\nof their horsemen for their security. After these he marched himself, having\nwith him a select body of footmen, and horsemen, and pikemen. After these\ncame the peculiar cavalry of his own legion, for there were a hundred and\ntwenty horsemen that peculiarly belonged to every legion. Next to these\ncame the mules that carried the engines for sieges, and the other warlike\nmachines of that nature. After these came the commanders of the cohorts\nand tribunes, having about them soldiers chosen out of the rest. Then came\nthe ensigns encompassing the eagle, which is at the head of every Roman\nlegion, the king, and the strongest of all birds, which seems to them a\nsignal of dominion, and an omen that they shall conquer all against whom\nthey march; these sacred ensigns are followed by the trumpeters. Then came\nthe main army in their squadrons and battalions, with six men in depth,\nwhich were followed at last by a centurion, who, according to custom, observed\nthe rest. As for the servants of every legion, they all followed the footmen,\nand led the baggage of the soldiers, which was borne by the mules and other\nbeasts of burden. But behind all the legions carne the whole multitude\nof the mercenaries; and those that brought up the rear came last of all\nfor the security of the whole army, being both footmen, and those in their\narmor also, with a great number of horsemen.", "And thus did Vespasian march with his army, and came to the bounds\nof Galileo, where he pitched his camp and restrained his soldiers, who\nwere eager for war; he also showed his army to the enemy, in order to affright\nthem, and to afford them a season for repentance, to see whether they would\nchange their minds before it came to a battle, and at the same time he\ngot things ready for besieging their strong minds. And indeed this sight\nof the general brought many to repent of their revolt, and put them all\ninto a consternation; for those that were in Josephus's camp, which was\nat the city called Garis, not far from Sepphoris, when they heard that\nthe war was come near them, and that the Romans would suddenly fight them\nhand to hand, dispersed themselves and fled, not only before they came\nto a battle, but before the enemy ever came in sight, while Josephus and\na few others were left behind; and as he saw that he had not an army sufficient\nto engage the enemy, that the spirits of the Jews were sunk, and that the\ngreater part would willingly come to terms, if they might be credited,\nhe already despaired of the success of the whole war, and determined to\nget as far as he possibly could out of danger; so he took those that staid\nalong with him, and fled to Tiberias.", "SO Vespasian marched to the city Gadara, and took it upon the first\nonset, because he found it destitute of any considerable number of men\ngrown up and fit for war. He came then into it, and slew all the youth,\nthe Romans having no mercy on any age whatsoever; and this was done out\nof the hatred they bore the nation, and because of the iniquity they had\nbeen guilty of in the affair of Cestius. He also set fire not only to the\ncity itself, but to all the villas and small cities that were round about\nit; some of them were quite destitute of inhabitants, and out of some of\nthem he carried the inhabitants as slaves into captivity.", "As to Josephus, his retiring to that city which he chose as the most\nfit for his security, put it into great fear; for the people of Tiberias\ndid not imagine that he would have run away, unless he had entirely despaired\nof the success of the war. And indeed, as to that point, they were not\nmistaken about his opinion; for he saw whither the affairs of the Jews\nwould tend at last, and was sensible that they had but one way of escaping,\nand that was by repentance. However, although he expected that the Romans\nwould forgive him, yet did he chose to die many times over, rather than\nto betray his country, and to dishonor that supreme command of the army\nwhich had been intrusted with him, or to live happily under those against\nwhom he was sent to fight. He determined, therefore, to give an exact account\nof affairs to the principal men at Jerusalem by a letter, that he might\nnot, by too much aggrandizing the power of the enemy, make them too timorous;\nnor, by relating that their power beneath the truth, might encourage them\nto stand out when they were perhaps disposed to repentance. He also sent\nthem word, that if they thought of coming to terms, they must suddenly\nwrite him an answer; or if they resolved upon war, they must send him an\narmy sufficient to fight the Romans. Accordingly, he wrote these things,\nand sent messengers immediately to carry his letter to Jerusalem.", "Now Vespasian was very desirous of demolishing Jotapata, for he had\ngotten intelligence that the greatest part of the enemy had retired thither,\nand that it was, on other accounts, a place of great security to them.\nAccordingly, he sent both foot-men and horsemen to level the road, which\nwas mountainous and rocky, not without difficulty to be traveled over by\nfootmen, but absolutely impracticable for horsemen. Now these workmen accomplished\nwhat they were about in four days' time, and opened a broad way for the\narmy. On the fifth day, which was the twenty-first of the month Artemisius,\n(Jyar,) Josephus prevented him, and came from Tiberias, and went into Jotapata,\nand raised the drooping spirits of the Jews. And a certain deserter told\nthis good news to Vespasian, that Josephus had removed himself thither,\nwhich made him make haste to the city, as supposing that with taking that\nhe should take all Judea, in case he could but withal get Josephus under\nhis power. So he took this news to be of the vastest advantage to him,\nand believed it to be brought about by the providence of God, that he who\nappeared to be the most prudent man of all their enemies, had, of his own\naccord, shut himself up in a place of sure custody. Accordingly, he sent\nPlacidus with a thousand horsemen, and Ebutius a decurion, a person that\nwas of eminency both in council and in action, to encompass the city round,\nthat Josephus might not escape away privately.", "Vespasian also, the very next day, took his whole army and followed\nthem, and by marching till late in the evening, arrived then at Jotapata;\nand bringing his army to the northern side of the city, he pitched his\ncamp on a certain small hill which was seven furlongs from the city, and\nstill greatly endeavored to be well seen by the enemy, to put them into\na consternation; which was indeed so terrible to the Jews immediately,\nthat no one of them durst go out beyond the wall. Yet did the Romans put\noff the attack at that time, because they had marched all the day, although\nthey placed a double row of battalions round the city, with a third row\nbeyond them round the whole, which consisted of cavalry, in order to stop\nup every way for an exit; which thing making the Jews despair of escaping,\nexcited them to act more boldly; for nothing makes men fight so desperately\nin war as necessity.", "Now when the next day an assault was made by the Romans, the Jews\nat first staid out of the walls and opposed them, and met them, as having\nformed themselves a camp before the city walls. But when Vespasian had\nset against them the archers and slingers, and the whole multitude that\ncould throw to a great distance, he permitted them to go to work, while\nhe himself, with the footmen, got upon an acclivity, whence the city might\neasily be taken. Josephus was then in fear for the city, and leaped out,\nand all the Jewish multitude with him; these fell together upon the Romans\nin great numbers, and drove them away from the wall, and performed a great\nmany glorious and bold actions. Yet did they suffer as much as they made\nthe enemy suffer; for as despair of deliverance encouraged the Jews, so\ndid a sense of shame equally encourage the Romans. These last had skill\nas well as strength; the other had only courage, which armed them, and\nmade them fight furiously. And when the fight had lasted all day, it was\nput an end to by the coming on of the night. They had wounded a great many\nof the Romans, and killed of them thirteen men; of the Jews' side seventeen\nwere slain, and six hundred wounded.", "On the next day the Jews made another attack upon the Romans, and\nwent out of the walls and fought a much more desperate battle with them\ntitan before. For they were now become more courageous than formerly, and\nthat on account of the unexpected good opposition they had made the day\nbefore, as they found the Romans also to fight more desperately; for a\nsense of shame inflamed these into a passion, as esteeming their failure\nof a sudden victory to be a kind of defeat. Thus did the Romans try to\nmake an impression upon the Jews till the fifth day continually, while\nthe people of Jotapata made sallies out, and fought at the walls most desperately;\nnor were the Jews affrighted at the strength of the enemy, nor were the\nRomans discouraged at the difficulties they met with in taking the city.", "Now Jotapata is almost all of it built on a precipice, having on\nall the other sides of it every way valleys immensely deep and steep, insomuch\nthat those who would look down would have their sight fail them before\nit reaches to the bottom. It is only to be come at on the north side, where\nthe utmost part of the city is built on the mountain, as it ends obliquely\nat a plain. This mountain Josephus had encompassed with a wall when he\nfortified the city, that its top might not be capable of being seized upon\nby the enemies. The city is covered all round with other mountains, and\ncan no way be seen till a man comes just upon it. And this was the strong\nsituation of Jotapata.", "Vespasian, therefore, in order to try how he might overcome the natural\nstrength of the place, as well as the bold defense of the Jews, made a\nresolution to prosecute the siege with vigor. To that end he called the\ncommanders that were under him to a council of war, and consulted with\nthem which way the assault might be managed to the best advantage. And\nwhen the resolution was there taken to raise a bank against that part of\nthe wall which was practicable, he sent his whole army abroad to get the\nmaterials together. So when they had cut down all the trees on the mountains\nthat adjoined to the city, and had gotten together a vast heap of stones,\nbesides the wood they had cut down, some of them brought hurdles, in order\nto avoid the effects of the darts that were shot from above them. These\nhurdles they spread over their banks, under cover whereof they formed their\nbank, and so were little or nothing hurt by the darts that were thrown\nupon them from the wall, while others pulled the neighboring hillocks to\npieces, and perpetually brought earth to them; so that while they were\nbusy three sorts of ways, nobody was idle. However, the Jews cast great\nstones from the walls upon the hurdles which protected the men, with all\nsorts of darts also; and the noise of what could not reach them was yet\nso terrible, that it was some impediment to the workmen.", "Vespasian then set the engines for throwing stones and darts round\nabout the city. The number of the engines was in all a hundred and sixty,\nand bid them fall to work, and dislodge those that were upon the wall.\nAt the same time such engines as were intended for that purpose threw at\nonce lances upon them with a great noise, and stones of the weight of a\ntalent were thrown by the engines that were prepared for that purpose,\ntogether with fire, and a vast multitude of arrows, which made the wall\nso dangerous, that the Jews durst not only not come upon it, but durst\nnot come to those parts within the walls which were reached by the engines;\nfor the multitude of the Arabian archers, as well also as all those that\nthrew darts and slung stones, fell to work at the same time with the engines.\nYet did not the otters lie still, when they could not throw at the Romans\nfrom a higher place; for they then made sallies out of the city, like private\nrobbers, by parties, and pulled away the hurdles that covered the workmen,\nand killed them when they were thus naked; and when those workmen gave\nway, these cast away the earth that composed the bank, and burnt the wooden\nparts of it, together with the hurdles, till at length Vespasian perceived\nthat the intervals there were between the works were of disadvantage to\nhim; for those spaces of ground afforded the Jews a place for assaulting\nthe Romans. So he united the hurdles, and at the same time joined one part\nof the army to the other, which prevented the private excursions of the\nJews.", "And when the bank was now raised, and brought nearer than ever to\nthe battlements that belonged to the walls, Josephus thought it would be\nentirely wrong in him if he could make no contrivances in opposition to\ntheirs, and that might be for the city's preservation; so he got together\nhis workmen, and ordered them to build the wall higher; and while they\nsaid that this was impossible to be done while so many darts were thrown\nat them, he invented this sort of cover for them: He bid them fix piles,\nand expand before them the raw hides of oxen newly killed, that these hides\nby yielding and hollowing themselves when the stones were thrown at them\nmight receive them, for that the other darts would slide off them, and\nthe fire that was thrown would be quenched by the moisture that was in\nthem. And these he set before the workmen, and under them these workmen\nwent on with their works in safety, and raised the wall higher, and that\nboth by day and by night, fill it was twenty cubits high. He also built\na good number of towers upon the wall, and fitted it to strong battlements.\nThis greatly discouraged the Romans, who in their own opinions were already\ngotten within the walls, while they were now at once astonished at Josephus's\ncontrivance, and at the fortitude of the citizens that were in the city.", "And now Vespasian was plainly irritated at the great subtlety of\nthis stratagem, and at the boldness of the citizens of Jotapata; for taking\nheart again upon the building of this wall, they made fresh sallies upon\nthe Romans, and had every day conflicts with them by parties, together\nwith all such contrivances, as robbers make use of, and with the plundering\nof all that came to hand, as also with the setting fire to all the other\nworks; and this till Vespasian made his army leave off fighting them, and\nresolved to lie round the city, and to starve them into a surrender, as\nsupposing that either they would be forced to petition him for mercy by\nwant of provisions, or if they should have the courage to hold out till\nthe last, they should perish by famine: and he concluded he should conquer\nthem the more easily in fighting, if he gave them an interval, and then\nfell upon them when they were weakened by famine; but still he gave orders\nthat they should guard against their coming out of the city.", "Now the besieged had plenty of corn within the city, and indeed\nof all necessaries, but they wanted water, because there was no fountain\nin the city, the people being there usually satisfied with rain water;\nyet is it a rare thing in that country to have rain in summer, and at this\nseason, during the siege, they were in great distress for some contrivance\nto satisfy their thirst; and they were very sad at this time particularly,\nas if they were already in want of water entirely, for Josephus seeing\nthat the city abounded with other necessaries, and that the men were of\ngood courage, and being desirous to protract the siege to the Romans longer\nthan they expected, ordered their drink to be given them by measure; but\nthis scanty distribution of water by measure was deemed by them as a thing\nmore hard upon them than the want of it; and their not being able to drink\nas much as they would made them more desirous of drinking than they otherwise\nhad been; nay, they were as much disheartened hereby as if they were come\nto the last degree of thirst. Nor were the Romans unacquainted with the\nstate they were in, for when they stood over against them, beyond the wall,\nthey could see them running together, and taking their water by measure,\nwhich made them throw their javelins thither the place being within their\nreach, and kill a great many of them.", "Hereupon Vespasian hoped that their receptacles of water would in\nno long time be emptied, and that they would be forced to deliver up the\ncity to him; but Josephus being minded to break such his hope, gave command\nthat they should wet a great many of their clothes, and hang them out about\nthe battlements, till the entire wall was of a sudden all wet with the\nrunning down of the water. At this sight the Romans were discouraged, and\nunder consternation, when they saw them able to throw away in sport so\nmuch water, when they supposed them not to have enough to drink themselves.\nThis made the Roman general despair of taking the city by their want of\nnecessaries, and to betake himself again to arms, and to try to force them\nto surrender, which was what the Jews greatly desired; for as they despaired\nof either themselves or their city being able to escape, they preferred\na death in battle before one by hunger and thirst.", "However, Josephus contrived another stratagem besides the foregoing,\nto get plenty of what they wanted. There was a certain rough and uneven\nplace that could hardly be ascended, and on that account was not guarded\nby the soldiers; so Josephus sent out certain persons along the western\nparts of the valley, and by them sent letters to whom he pleased of the\nJews that were out of the city, and procured from them what necessaries\nsoever they wanted in the city in abundance; he enjoined them also to creep\ngenerally along by the watch as they came into the city, and to cover their\nbacks with such sheep-skins as had their wool upon them, that if any one\nshould spy them out in the night time, they might be believed to be dogs.\nThis was done till the watch perceived their contrivance, and encompassed\nthat rough place about themselves.", "And now it was that Josephus perceived that the city could not hold\nout long, and that his own life would be in doubt if he continued in it;\nso he consulted how he and the most potent men of the city might fly out\nof it. When the multitude understood this, they came all round about him,\nand begged of him not to overlook them while they entirely depended on\nhim, and him alone; for that there was still hope of the city's deliverance,\nif he would stay with them, because every body would undertake any pains\nwith great cheerfulness on his account, and in that case there would be\nsome comfort for them also, though they should be taken: that it became\nhim neither to fly from his enemies, nor to desert his friends, nor to\nleap out of that city, as out of a ship that was sinking in a storm, into\nwhich he came when it was quiet and in a calm; for that by going away he\nwould be the cause of drowning the city, because nobody would then venture\nto oppose the enemy when he was once gone, upon whom they wholly confided.", "Hereupon Josephus avoided letting them know that he was to go away\nto provide for his own safety, but told them that he would go out of the\ncity for their sakes; for that if he staid with them, he should be able\nto do them little good while they were in a safe condition; and that if\nthey were once taken, he should only perish with them to no purpose; but\nthat if he were once gotten free from this siege, he should be able to\nbring them very great relief; for that he would then immediately get the\nGalileans together, out of the country, in great multitudes, and draw the\nRomans off their city by another war. That he did not see what advantge\nhe could bring to them now, by staying among them, but only provoke the\nRomans to besiege them more closely, as esteeming it a most valuable thing\nto take him; but that if they were once informed that he was fled out of\nthe city, they would greatly remit of their eagerness against it. Yet did\nnot this plea move the people, but inflamed them the more to hang about\nhim. Accordingly, both the children and the old men, and the women with\ntheir infants, came mourning to him, and fell down before him, and all\nof them caught hold of his feet, and held him fast, and besought him, with\ngreat lamentations, that he would take his share with them in their fortune;\nand I think they did this, not that they envied his deliverance, but that\nthey hoped for their own; for they could not think they should suffer any\ngreat misfortune, provided Josephus would but stay with them.", "Now Josephus thought, that if he resolved to stay, it would be ascribed\nto their entreaties; and if he resolved to go away by force, he should\nbe put into custody. His commiseration also of the people under their lamentations\nhad much broken that his eagerness to leave them; so he resolved to stay,\nand arming himself with the common despair of the citizens, he said to\nthem, \"Now is the time to begin to fight in earnest, when there is\nno hope of deliverance left. It is a brave thing to prefer glory before\nlife, and to set about some such noble undertaking as may be remembered\nby late posterity.\" Having said this, he fell to work immediately,\nand made a sally, and dispersed the enemies' out-guards, and ran as far\nas the Roman camp itself, and pulled the coverings of their tents to pieces,\nthat were upon their banks, and set fire to their works. And this was the\nmanner in which he never left off fighting, neither the next day, nor the\nday after it, but went on with it for a considerable number of both days\nand nights.", "Upon this, Vespasian, when he saw the Romans distressed by these\nsallies, (though they were ashamed to be made to run away by the Jews;\nand when at any time they made the Jews run away, their heavy armor would\nnot let them pursue them far; while the Jews, when they had performed any\naction, and before they could be hurt themselves, still retired into the\ncity,) ordered his armed men to avoid their onset, and not fight it out\nwith men under desperation, while nothing is more courageous than despair;\nbut that their violence would be quenched when they saw they failed of\ntheir purposes, as fire is quenched when it wants fuel; and that it was\nproper for the Romans to gain their victories as cheap as they could, since\nthey are not forced to fight, but only to enlarge their own dominions.\nSo he repelled the Jews in great measure by the Arabian archers, and the\nSyrian slingers, and by those that threw stones at them, nor was there\nany intermission of the great number of their offensive engines. Now the\nJews suffered greatly by these engines, without being able to escape from\nthem; and when these engines threw their stones or javelins a great way,\nand the Jews were within their reach, they pressed hard upon the Romans,\nand fought desperately, without sparing either soul or body, one part succoring\nanother by turns, when it was tired down.", "When, therefore, Vespasian looked upon himself as in a manner besieged\nby these sallies of the Jews, and when his banks were now not far from\nthe walls, he determined to make use of his battering ram. This battering\nram is a vast beam of wood like the mast of a ship, its forepart is armed\nwith a thick piece of iron at the head of it, which is so carved as to\nbe like the head of a ram, whence its name is taken. This ram is slung\nin the air by ropes passing over its middle, and is hung like the balance\nin a pair of scales from another beam, and braced by strong beams that\npass on both sides of it, in the nature of a cross. When this ram is pulled\nbackward by a great number of men with united force, and then thrust forward\nby the same men, with a mighty noise, it batters the walls with that iron\npart which is prominent. Nor is there any tower so strong, or walls so\nbroad, that can resist any more than its first batteries, but all are forced\nto yield to it at last. This was the experiment which the Roman general\nbetook himself to, when he was eagerly bent upon taking the city; but found\nlying in the field so long to be to his disadvantage, because the Jews\nwould never let him be quiet. So these Romans brought the several engines\nfor galling an enemy nearer to the walls, that they might reach such as\nwere upon the wall, and endeavored to frustrate their attempts; these threw\nstones and javelins at them; in the like manner did the archers and slingers\ncome both together closer to the wall. This brought matters to such a pass\nthat none of the Jews durst mount the walls, and then it was that the other\nRomans brought the battering ram that was cased with hurdles all over,\nand in the tipper part was secured by skins that covered it, and this both\nfor the security of themselves and of the engine. Now, at the very first\nstroke of this engine, the wall was shaken, and a terrible clamor was raised\nby the people within the city, as if they were already taken.", "And now, when Josephus saw this ram still battering the same place,\nand that the wall would quickly be thrown down by it, he resolved to elude\nfor a while the force of the engine. With this design he gave orders to\nfill sacks with chaff, and to hang them down before that place where they\nsaw the ram always battering, that the stroke might be turned aside, or\nthat the place might feel less of the strokes by the yielding nature of\nthe chaff. This contrivance very much delayed the attempts of the Romans,\nbecause, let them remove their engine to what part they pleased, those\nthat were above it removed their sacks, and placed them over against the\nstrokes it made, insomuch that the wall was no way hurt, and this by diversion\nof the strokes, till the Romans made an opposite contrivance of long poles,\nand by tying hooks at their ends, cut off the sacks. Now when the battering\nram thus recovered its force, and the wall having been but newly built,\nwas giving way, Josephus and those about him had afterward immediate recourse\nto fire, to defend themselves withal; whereupon they took what materials\nsoever they had that were but dry, and made a sally three ways, and set\nfire to the machines, and the hurdles, and the banks of the Romans themselves;\nnor did the Romans well know how to come to their assistance, being at\nonce under a consternation at the Jews' boldness, and being prevented by\nthe flames from coming to their assistance; for the materials being dry\nwith the bitumen and pitch that were among them, as was brimstone also,\nthe fire caught hold of every thing immediately, and what cost the Romans\na great deal of pains was in one hour consumed.", "And here a certain Jew appeared worthy of our relation and commendation;\nhe was the son of Sameas, and was called Eleazar, and was born at Saab,\nin Galilee. This man took up a stone of a vast bigness, and threw it down\nfrom the wall upon the ram, and this with so great a force, that it broke\noff the head of the engine. He also leaped down, and took up the head of\nthe ram from the midst of them, and without any concern carried it to the\ntop of the wall, and this while he stood as a fit mark to he pelted by\nall his enemies. Accordingly, he received the strokes upon his naked body,\nand was wounded with five darts; nor did he mind any of them while he went\nup to the top of the wall, where he stood in the sight of them all, as\nan instance of the greatest boldness; after which he drew himself on a\nheap with his wounds upon him, and fell down together with the head of\nthe ram. Next to him, two brothers showed their courage; their names were\nNetir and Philip, both of them of the village Ruma, and both of them Galileans\nalso; these men leaped upon the soldiers of the tenth legion, and fell\nupon the Romans with such a noise and force as to disorder their ranks,\nand to put to flight all upon whomsoever they made their assaults.", "After these men's performances, Josephus, and the rest of the multitude\nwith him, took a great deal of fire, and burnt both the machines and their\ncoverings, with the works belonging to the fifth and to the tenth legion,\nwhich they put to flight; when others followed them immediately, and buried\nthose instruments and all their materials under ground. However, about\nthe evening, the Romans erected the battering ram again, against that part\nof the wall which had suffered before; where a certain Jew that defended\nthe city from the Romans hit Vespasian with a dart in his foot, and wounded\nhim a little, the distance being so great, that no mighty impression could\nbe made by the dart thrown so far off. However, this caused the greatest\ndisorder among the Romans; for when those who stood near him saw his blood,\nthey were disturbed at it, and a report went abroad, through the whole\narmy, that the general was wounded, while the greatest part left the siege,\nand came running together with surprise and fear to the general; and before\nthem all came Titus, out of the concern he had for his father, insomuch\nthat the multitude were in great confusion, and this out of the regard\nthey had for their general, and by reason of the agony that the son was\nin. Yet did the father soon put an end to the son's fear, and to the disorder\nthe army was under, for being superior to his pains, and endeavoring soon\nto be seen by all that had been in a fright about him, he excited them\nto fight the Jews more briskly; for now every body was willing to expose\nhimself to danger immediately, in order to avenge their general; and then\nthey encouraged one another with loud voices, and ran hastily to the walls.", "But still Josephus and those with him, although they fell down dead\none upon another by the darts and stones which the engines threw upon them,\nyet did not they desert the wall, but fell upon those who managed the ram,\nunder the protection of the hurdles, with fire, and iron weapons, and stones;\nand these could do little or nothing, but fell themselves perpetually,\nwhile they were seen by those whom they could not see, for the light of\ntheir own flame shone about them, and made them a most visible mark to\nthe enemy, as they were in the day time, while the engines could not be\nseen at a great distance, and so what was thrown at them was hard to be\navoided; for the force with which these engines threw stones and darts\nmade them hurt several at a time, and the violent noise of the stones that\nwere cast by the engines was so great, that they carried away the pinnacles\nof the wall, and broke off the corners of the towers; for no body of men\ncould be so strong as not to be overthrown to the last rank by the largeness\nof the stones. And any one may learn the force of the engines by what happened\nthis very night; for as one of those that stood round about Josephus was\nnear the wall, his head was carried away by such a stone, and his skull\nwas flung as far as three furlongs. In the day time also, a woman with\nchild had her belly so violently struck, as she was just come out of her\nhouse, that the infant was carried to the distance of half a furlong, so\ngreat was the force of that engine. The noise of the instruments themselves\nwas very terrible, the sound of the darts and stones that were thrown by\nthem was so also; of the same sort was that noise the dead bodies made,\nwhen they were dashed against the wall; and indeed dreadful was the clamor\nwhich these things raised in the women within the city, which was echoed\nback at the same time by the cries of such as were slain; while the whole\nspace of ground whereon they fought ran with blood, and the wall might\nhave been ascended over by the bodies of the dead carcasses; the mountains\nalso contributed to increase the noise by their echoes; nor was there on\nthat night any thing of terror wanting that could either affect the hearing\nor the sight: yet did a great part of those that fought so hard for Jotapata\nfall manfully, as were a great part of them wounded. However, the morning\nwatch was come ere the wall yielded to the machines employed against it,\nthough it had been battered without intermission. However, those within\ncovered their bodies with their armor, and raised works over against that\npart which was thrown down, before those machines were laid by which the\nRomans were to ascend into the city.", "In the morning Vespasian got his army together, in order to take\nthe city [by storm], after a little recreation upon the hard pains they\nhad been at the night before; and as he was desirous to draw off those\nthat opposed him from the places where the wall had been thrown down, he\nmade the most courageous of the horsemen get off their horses, and placed\nthem in three ranks over against those ruins of the wall, but covered with\ntheir armor on every side, and with poles in their hands, that so these\nmight begin their ascent as soon as the instruments for such ascent were\nlaid; behind them he placed the flower of the footmen; but for the rest\nof the horse, he ordered them to extend themselves over against the wall,\nupon the whole hilly country, in order to prevent any from escaping out\nof the city when it should be taken; and behind these he placed the archers\nround about, and commanded them to have their darts ready to shoot. The\nsame command he gave to the slingers, and to those that managed the engines,\nand bid them to take up other ladders, and have them ready to lay upon\nthose parts of the wall which were yet untouched, that the besieged might\nbe engaged in trying to hinder their ascent by them, and leave the guard\nof the parts that were thrown down, while the rest of them should be overborne\nby the darts cast at them, and might afford his men an entrance into the\ncity.", "But Josephus, understanding the meaning of Vespasian's contrivance,\nset the old men, together with those that were tired out, at the sound\nparts of the wall, as expecting no harm from those quarters, but set the\nstrongest of his men at the place where the wall was broken down, and before\nthem all six men by themselves, among whom he took his share of the first\nand greatest danger. He also gave orders, that when the legions made a\nshout, they should stop their ears, that they might not be affrighted at\nit, and that, to avoid the multitude of the enemy's darts, they should\nbend down on their knees, and cover themselves with their shields, and\nthat they should retreat a little backward for a while, till the archers\nshould have emptied their quivers; but that When the Romans should lay\ntheir instruments for ascending the walls, they should leap out on the\nsudden, and with their own instruments should meet the enemy, and that\nevery one should strive to do his best, in order not to defend his own\ncity, as if it were possible to be preserved, but in order to revenge it,\nwhen it was already destroyed; and that they should set before their eyes\nhow their old men were to be slain, and their children and wives were to\nbe killed immediately by the enemy; and that they would beforehand spend\nall their fury, on account of the calamities just coming upon them, and\npour it out on the actors.", "And thus did Josephus dispose of both his bodies of men; but then\nfor the useless part of the citizens, the women and children, when they\nsaw their city encompassed by a threefold army, (for none of the usual\nguards that had been fighting before were removed,) when they also saw,\nnot only the walls thrown down, but their enemies with swords in their\nhands, as also the hilly country above them shining with their weapons,\nd the darts in the hands of the Arabian archers, they made a final and\nlamentable outcry of the destruction, as if the misery were not only threatened,\nbut actually come upon them already. But Josephus ordered the women to\nbe shut up in their houses, lest they should render the warlike actions\nof the men too effeminate, by making them commiserate their condition,\nand commanded them to hold their peace, and threatened them if they did\nnot, while he came himself before the breach, where his allotment was;\nfor all those who brought ladders to the other places, he took no notice\nof them, but earnestly waited for the shower of arrows that was coming.", "And now the trumpeters of the several Roman legions sounded together,\nand the army made a terrible shout; and the darts, as by order, flew so\nlast, that they intercepted the light. However, Josephus's men remembered\nthe charges he had given them, they stopped their ears at the sounds, and\ncovered their bodies against the darts; and as to the engines that were\nset ready to go to work, the Jews ran out upon them, before those that\nshould have used them were gotten upon them. And now, on the ascending\nof the soldiers, there was a great conflict, and many actions of the hands\nand of the soul were exhibited; while the Jews did earnestly endeavor,\nin the extreme danger they were in, not to show less courage than those\nwho, without being in danger, fought so stoutly against them; nor did they\nleave struggling with the Romans till they either fell down dead themselves,\nor killed their antagonists. But the Jews grew weary with defending themselves\ncontinually, and had not enough to come in their places, and succor them;\nwhile, on the side of the Romans, fresh men still succeeded those that\nwere tired; and still new men soon got upon the machines for ascent, in\nthe room of those that were thrust down; those encouraging one another,\nand joining side to side with their shields, which were a protection to\nthem, they became a body of men not to be broken; and as this band thrust\naway the Jews, as though they were themselves but one body, they began\nalready to get upon the wall.", "Then did Josephus take necessity for his counselor in this utmost\ndistress, (which necessity is very sagacious in invention when it is irritated\nby despair,) and gave orders to pour scalding oil upon those whose shields\nprotected them. Whereupon they soon got it ready, being many that brought\nit, and what they brought being a great quantity also, and poured it on\nall sides upon the Romans, and threw down upon them their vessels as they\nwere still hissing from the heat of the fire: this so burnt the Romans,\nthat it dispersed that united band, who now tumbled clown from the wall\nwith horrid pains, for the oil did easily run down the whole body from\nhead to foot, under their entire armor, and fed upon their flesh like flame\nitself, its fat and unctuous nature rendering it soon heated and slowly\ncooled; and as the men were cooped up in their head-pieces and breastplates,\nthey could no way get free from this burning oil; they could only leap\nand roll about in their pains, as they fell down from the bridges they\nhad laid. And as they thus were beaten back, and retired to their own party,\nwho still pressed them forward, they were easily wounded by those that\nwere behind them.", "However, in this ill success of the Romans, their courage did not\nfail them, nor did the Jews want prudence to oppose them; for the Romans,\nalthough they saw their own men thrown down, and in a miserable condition,\nyet were they vehemently bent against those that poured the oil upon them;\nwhile every one reproached the man before him as a coward, and one that\nhindered him from exerting himself; and while the Jews made use of another\nstratagem to prevent their ascent, and poured boiling fenugreek upon the\nboards, in order to make them slip and fall down; by which means neither\ncould those that were coming up, nor those that were going down, stand\non their feet; but some of them fell backward upon the machines on which\nthey ascended, and were trodden upon; many of them fell down upon the bank\nthey had raised, and when they were fallen upon it were slain by the Jews;\nfor when the Romans could not keep their feet, the Jews being freed from\nfighting hand to hand, had leisure to throw their darts at them. So the\ngeneral called off those soldiers in the evening that had suffered so sorely,\nof whom the number of the slain was not a few, while that of the wounded\nwas still greater; but of the people of Jotapata no more than six men were\nkilled, although more than three hundred were carried off wounded. This\nfight happened on the twentieth day of the month Desius [Sivan].", "Hereupon Vespasian comforted his army on occasion of what happened,\nand as he found them angry indeed, but rather wanting somewhat to do than\nany further exhortations, he gave orders to raise the banks still higher,\nand to erect three towers, each fifty feet high, and that they should cover\nthem with plates of iron on every side, that they might be both firm by\ntheir weight, and not easily liable to be set on fire. These towers he\nset upon the banks, and placed upon them such as could shoot darts and\narrows, with the lighter engines for throwing stones and darts also; and\nbesides these, he set upon them the stoutest men among the slingers, who\nnot being to be seen by reason of the height they stood upon, and the battlements\nthat protected them, might throw their weapons at those that were upon\nthe wall, and were easily seen by them. Hereupon the Jews, not being easily\nable to escape those darts that were thrown down upon their heads, nor\nto avenge themselves on those whom they could not see, and perceiving that\nthe height of the towers was so great, that a dart which they threw with\ntheir hand could hardly reach it, and that the iron plates about them made\nit very hard to come at them by fire, they ran away from the walls, and\nfled hastily out of the city, and fell upon those that shot at them. And\nthus did the people of Jotapata resist the Romans, while a great number\nof them were every day killed, without their being able to retort the evil\nupon their enemies; nor could they keep them out of the city without danger\nto themselves.", "About this time it was that Vespasian sent out Trajan against a\ncity called Japha, that lay near to Jotapata, and that desired innovations,\nand was puffed up with the unexpected length of the opposition of Jotapata.\nThis Trajan was the commander of the tenth legion, and to him Vespasian\ncommitted one thousand horsemen, and two thousand footmen. When Trajan\ncame to the city, he found it hard to be taken, for besides the natural\nstrength of its situation, it was also secured by a double wall; but when\nhe saw the people of this city coming out of it, and ready to fight him,\nhe joined battle with them, and after a short resistance which they made,\nhe pursued after them; and as they fled to their first wall, the Romans\nfollowed them so closely, that they fell in together with them: but when\nthe Jews were endeavoring to get again within their second wall, their\nfellow citizens shut them out, as being afraid that the Romans would force\nthemselves in with them. It was certainly God therefore who brought the\nRomans to punish the Galileans, and did then expose the people of the city\nevery one of them manifestly to be destroyed by their bloody enemies; for\nthey fell upon the gates in great crowds, and earnestly calling to those\nthat kept them, and that by their names also, yet had they their throats\ncut in the very midst of their supplications; for the enemy shut the gates\nof the first wall, and their own citizens shut the gates of the second,\nso they were enclosed between two walls, and were slain in great numbers\ntogether; many of them were run through by swords of their own men, and\nmany by their own swords, besides an immense number that were slain by\nthe Romans. Nor had they any courage to revenge themselves; for there was\nadded to the consternation they were in from the enemy, their being betrayed\nby their own friends, which quite broke their spirits; and at last they\ndied, cursing not the Romans, but their own citizens, till they were all\ndestroyed, being in number twelve thousand. So Trajan gathered that the\ncity was empty of people that could fight, and although there should a\nfew of them be therein, he supposed that they would be too timorous to\nventure upon any opposition; so he reserved the taking of the city to the\ngeneral. Accordingly, he sent messengers to Vespasian, and desired him\nto send his son Titus to finish the victory he had gained. Vespasian hereupon\nimagining there might be some pains still necessary, sent his son with\nan army of five hundred horsemen, and one thousand footmen. So he came\nquickly to the city, and put his army in order, and set Trajan over the\nleft wing, while he had the right himself, and led them to the siege: and\nwhen the soldiers brought ladders to be laid against the wall on every\nside, the Galileans opposed them from above for a while; but soon afterward\nthey left the walls. Then did Titus's men leap into the city, and seized\nupon it presently; but when those that were in it were gotten together,\nthere was a fierce battle between them; for the men of power fell upon\nthe Romans in the narrow streets, and the women threw whatsoever came next\nto hand at them, and sustained a fight with them for six hours' time; but\nwhen the fighting men were spent, the rest of the multitude had their throats\ncut, partly in the open air, and partly in their own houses, both young\nand old together. So there were no males now remaining, besides infants,\nwhich, with the women, were carried as slaves into captivity; so that the\nnumber of the slain, both now in the city and at the former fight, was\nfifteen thousand, and the captives were two thousand one hundred and thirty.\nThis calamity befell the Galileans on the twenty-fifth day of the month\nDesius [Sivan.]", "Nor did the Samaritans escape their share of misfortunes at this\ntime; for they assembled themselves together upon file mountain called\nGerizzim, which is with them a holy mountain, and there they remained;\nwhich collection of theirs, as well as the courageous minds they showed,\ncould not but threaten somewhat of war; nor were they rendered wiser by\nthe miseries that had come upon their neighboring cities. They also, notwithstanding\nthe great success the Romans had, marched on in an unreasonable manner,\ndepending on their own weakness, and were disposed for any tumult upon\nits first appearance. Vespasian therefore thought it best to prevent their\nmotions, and to cut off the foundation of their attempts. For although\nall Samaria had ever garrisons settled among them, yet did the number of\nthose that were come to Mount Gerizzim, and their conspiracy together,\ngive ground for fear what they would be at; he therefore sent I thither\nCerealis, the commander of the fifth legion, with six hundred horsemen,\nand three thousand footmen, who did not think it safe to go up to the mountain,\nand give them battle, because many of the enemy were on the higher part\nof the ground; so he encompassed all the lower part of the mountain with\nhis army, and watched them all that day. Now it happened that the Samaritans,\nwho were now destitute of water, were inflamed with a violent heat, (for\nit was summer time, and the multitude had not provided themselves with\nnecessaries,) insomuch that some of them died that very day with heat,\nwhile others of them preferred slavery before such a death as that was,\nand fled to the Romans; by whom Cerealis understood that those which still\nstaid there were very much broken by their misfortunes. So he went up to\nthe mountain, and having placed his forces round about the enemy, he, in\nthe first place, exhorted them to take the security of his right hand,\nand come to terms with him, and thereby save themselves; and assured them,\nthat if they would lay down their arms, he would secure them from any harm;\nbut when he could not prevail with them, he fell upon them and slew them\nall, being in number eleven thousand and six hundred. This was done on\nthe twenty-seventh day of the month Desius [Sivan]. And these were the\ncalamities that befell the Samaritans at this time.", "But as the people of Jotapata still held out manfully, and bore\nup tinder their miseries beyond all that could be hoped for, on the forty-seventh\nday [of the siege] the banks cast up by the Romans were become higher than\nthe wall; on which day a certain deserter went to Vespasian, and told him\nhow few were left in the city, and how weak they were, and that they had\nbeen so worn out with perpetual watching, and as perpetual fighting, that\nthey could not now oppose any force that came against them, and that they\nmight he taken by stratagem, if any one would attack them; for that about\nthe last watch of the night, when they thought they might have some rest\nfrom the hardships they were under, and when a morning sleep used to come\nupon them, as they were thoroughly weary, he said the watch used to fall\nasleep; accordingly his advice was, that they should make their attack\nat that hour. But Vespasian had a suspicion about this deserter, as knowing\nhow faithful the Jews were to one another, and how much they despised any\npunishments that could be inflicted on them; this last because one of the\npeople of Jotapata had undergone all sorts of torments, and though they\nmade him pass through a fiery trial of his enemies in his examination,\nyet would he inform them nothing of the affairs within the city, and as\nhe was crucified, smiled at them. However, the probability there was in\nthe relation itself did partly confirm the truth of what the deserter told\nthem, and they thought he might probably speak truth. However, Vespasian\nthought they should be no great sufferers if the report was a sham; so\nhe commanded them to keep the man in custody, and prepared the army for\ntaking the city.", "According to which resolution they marched without noise, at the\nhour that had been told them, to the wall; and it was Titus himself that\nfirst got upon it, with one of his tribunes, Domitius Sabinus, and had\na few of the fifteenth legion along with him. So they cut the throats of\nthe watch, and entered the city very quietly. After these came Cerealis\nthe tribune, and Placidus, and led on those that were tinder them. Now\nwhen the citadel was taken, and the enemy were in the very midst of the\ncity, and when it was already day, yet was not the taking of the city known\nby those that held it; for a great many of them were fast asleep, and a\ngreat mist, which then by chance fell upon the city, hindered those that\ngot up from distinctly seeing the case they were in, till the whole Roman\narmy was gotten in, and they were raised up only to find the miseries they\nwere under; and as they were slaying, they perceived the city was taken.\nAnd for the Romans, they so well remembered what they had suffered during\nthe siege, that they spared none, nor pitied any, but drove the people\ndown the precipice from the citadel, and slew them as they drove them down;\nat which time the difficulties of the place hindered those that were still\nable to fight from defending themselves; for as they were distressed in\nthe narrow streets, and could not keep their feet sure along the precipice,\nthey were overpowered with the crowd of those that came fighting them down\nfrom the citadel. This provoked a great many, even of those chosen men\nthat were about Josephus, to kill themselves with their own hands; for\nwhen they saw that they could kill none of the Romans, they resolved to\nprevent being killed by the Romans, and got together in great numbers in\nthe utmost parts of the city, and killed themselves.", "However, such of the watch as at the first perceived they were taken,\nand ran away as fast as they could, went up into one of the towers on the\nnorth side of the city, and for a while defended themselves there; but\nas they were encompassed with a multitude of enemies, they tried to use\ntheir right hands when it was too late, and at length they cheerfully offered\ntheir necks to be cut off by those that stood over them. And the Romans\nmight have boasted that the conclusion of that siege was without blood\n[on their side] if there had not been a centurion, Antonius, who was slain\nat the taking of the city. His death was occasioned by the following treachery;\nfor there was one of those that were fled into the caverns, which were\na great number, who desired that this Antonius would reach him his right\nhand for his security, and would assure him that he would preserve him,\nand give him his assistance in getting up out of the cavern; accordingly,\nhe incautiously reached him his right hand, when the other man prevented\nhim, and stabbed him under his loins with a spear, and killed him immediately.", "And on this day it was that the Romans slew all the multitude that\nappeared openly; but on the following days they searched the hiding-places,\nand fell upon those that were under ground, and in the caverns, and went\nthus through every age, excepting the infants and the women, and of these\nthere were gathered together as captives twelve hundred; and as for those\nthat were slain at the taking of the city, and in the former fights, they\nwere numbered to be forty thousand. So Vespasian gave order that the city\nshould be entirely demolished, and all the fortifications burnt down. And\nthus was Jotapata taken, in the thirteenth year of the reign of Nero, on\nthe first day of the month Panemus [Tamuz].", "AND now the Romans searched for Josephus, both out of the hatred\nthey bore him, and because their general was very desirous to have him\ntaken; for he reckoned that if he were once taken, the greatest part of\nthe war would be over. They then searched among the dead, and looked into\nthe most concealed recesses of the city; but as the city was first taken,\nhe was assisted by a certain supernatural providence; for he withdrew himself\nfrom the enemy when he was in the midst of them, and leaped into a certain\ndeep pit, whereto there adjoined a large den at one side of it, which den\ncould not be seen by those that were above ground; and there he met with\nforty persons of eminency that had concealed themselves, and with provisions\nenough to satisfy them for not a few days. So in the day time he hid himself\nfrom the enemy, who had seized upon all places, and in the night time he\ngot up out of the den and looked about for some way of escaping, and took\nexact notice of the watch; but as all places were guarded every where on\nhis account, that there was no way of getting off unseen, he went down\nagain into the den. Thus he concealed himself two days; but on the third\nday, when they had taken a woman who had been with them, he was discovered.\nWhereupon Vespasian sent immediately and zealously two tribunes, Paulinus\nand Gallicanus, and ordered them to give Josephus their right hands as\na security for his life, and to exhort him to come up.", "So they came and invited the man to come up, and gave him assurances\nthat his life should be preserved: but they did not prevail with him; for\nhe gathered suspicions from the probability there was that one who had\ndone so many things against the Romans must suffer for it, though not from\nthe mild temper of those that invited him. However, he was afraid that\nhe was invited to come up in order to be punished, until Vespasian sent\nbesides these a third tribune, Nicanor, to him; he was one that was well\nknown to Josephus, and had been his familiar acquaintance in old time.\nWhen he was come, he enlarged upon the natural mildness of the Romans towards\nthose they have once conquered; and told him that he had behaved himself\nso valiantly, that the commanders rather admired than hated him; that the\ngeneral was very desirous to have him brought to him, not in order to punish\nhim, for that he could do though he should not come voluntarily, but that\nhe was determined to preserve a man of his courage. He moreover added this,\nthat Vespasian, had he been resolved to impose upon him, would not have\nsent to him a friend of his own, nor put the fairest color upon the vilest\naction, by pretending friendship and meaning perfidiousness; nor would\nhe have himself acquiesced, or come to him, had it been to deceive him.", "Now as Josephus began to hesitate with himself about Nicanor's proposal,\nthe soldiery were so angry, that they ran hastily to set fire to the den;\nbut the tribune would not permit them so to do, as being very desirous\nto take the man alive. And now, as Nicanor lay hard at Josephus to comply,\nand he understood how the multitude of the enemies threatened him, he called\nto mind the dreams which he had dreamed in the night time, whereby God\nhad signified to him beforehand both the future calamities of the Jews,\nand the events that concerned the Roman emperors. Now Josephus was able\nto give shrewd conjectures about the interpretation of such dreams as have\nbeen ambiguously delivered by God. Moreover, he was not unacquainted with\nthe prophecies contained in the sacred books, as being a priest himself,\nand of the posterity of priests: and just then was he in an ecstasy; and\nsetting before him the tremendous images of the dreams he had lately had,\nhe put up a secret prayer to God, and said, \"Since it pleaseth thee,\nwho hast created the Jewish nation, to depress the same, and since all\ntheir good fortune is gone over to the Romans, and since thou hast made\nchoice of this soul of mine to foretell what is to come to pass hereafter,\nI willingly give them my hands, and am content to live. And I protest openly\nthat I do not go over to the Romans as a deserter of the Jews, but as a\nminister from thee.\"", "When he had said this, he complied with Nicanor's invitation. But\nwhen those Jews who had fled with him understood that he yielded to those\nthat invited him to come up, they came about him in a body, and cried out,\n\"Nay, indeed, now may the laws of our forefathers, which God ordained\nhimself, well groan to purpose; that God we mean who hath created the souls\nof the Jews of such a temper, that they despise death. O Josephus! art\nthou still fond of life? and canst thou bear to see the light in a state\nof slavery? How soon hast thou forgotten thyself! How many hast thou persuaded\nto lose their lives for liberty! Thou hast therefore had a false reputation\nfor manhood, and a like false reputation for wisdom, if thou canst hope\nfor preservation from those against whom thou hast fought so zealously,\nand art however willing to be preserved by them, if they be in earnest.\nBut although the good fortune of the Romans hath made thee forget thyself,\nwe ought to take care that the glory of our forefathers may not be tarnished.\nWe will lend thee our right hand and a sword; and if thou wilt die willingly,\nthou wilt die as general of the Jews; but if unwillingly, thou wilt die\nas a traitor to them.\" As soon as they said this, they began to thrust\ntheir swords at him, and threatened they would kill him, if he thought\nof yielding himself to the Romans.", {"foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "depositum"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "depositum"}], "#text": "Upon this Josephus was afraid of their attacking him, and yet thought\nhe should be a betrayer of the commands of God, if he died before they\nwere delivered. So he began to talk like a philosopher to them in the distress\nhe was then in, when he said thus to them: \"O my friends, why are\nwe so earnest to kill ourselves? and why do we set our soul and body, which\nare such dear companions, at such variance? Can any one pretend that I\nam not the man I was formerly? Nay, the Romans are sensible how that matter\nstands well enough. It is a brave thin to die in war; but so that it be\naccording to the law of war, by the hand of conquerors. If, therefore,\nI avoid death from the sword of the Romans, I am truly worthy to be killed\nby my own sword, and my own hand; but if they admit of mercy, and would\nspare their enemy, how much more ought we to have mercy upon ourselves,\nand to spare ourselves? For it is certainly a foolish thing to do that\nto ourselves which we quarrel with them for doing to us. I confess freely\nthat it is a brave thing to die for liberty; but still so that it be in\nwar, and done by those who take that liberty from us; but in the present\ncase our enemies do neither meet us in battle, nor do they kill us. Now\nhe is equally a coward who will not die when he is obliged to die, and\nhe who will die when he is not obliged so to do. What are we afraid of,\nwhen we will not go up to the Romans? Is it death? If so, what we are afraid\nof, when we but suspect our enemies will inflict it on us, shall we inflict\nit on ourselves for certain? But it may be said we must be slaves. And\nare we then in a clear state of liberty at present? It may also be said\nthat it is a manly act for one to kill himself. No, certainly, but a most\nunmanly one; as I should esteem that pilot to be an arrant coward, who,\nout of fear of a storm, should sink his ship of his own accord. Now self-murder\nis a crime most remote from the common nature of all animals, and an instance\nof impiety against God our Creator; nor indeed is there any animal that\ndies by its own contrivance, or by its own means, for the desire of life\nis a law engraven in them all; on which account we deem those that openly\ntake it away from us to be our enemies, and those that do it by treachery\nare punished for so doing. And do not you think that God is very angry\nwhen a man does injury to what he hath bestowed on him? For from him it\nis that we have received our being, and we ought to leave it to his disposal\nto take that being away from us. The bodies of all men are indeed mortal,\nand are created out of corruptible matter; but the soul is ever immortal,\nand is a portion of the divinity that inhabits our bodies. Besides, if\nany one destroys or abuses a  he hath received from a mere\nman, he is esteemed a wicked and perfidious person; but then if any one\ncast out of his body this Divine , can we imagine that\nhe who is thereby affronted does not know of it? Moreover, our law justly\nordains that slaves which run away from their master shall be punished,\nthough the masters they run away from may have been wicked masters to them.\nAnd shall we endeavor to run away from God, who is the best of all masters,\nand not guilty of impeity? Do not you know that those who depart out of\nthis life according to the law of nature, and pay that debt which was received\nfrom God, when he that lent it us is pleased to require it back again,\nenjoy eternal fame; that their houses and their posterity are sure, that\ntheir souls are pure and obedient, and obtain a most holy place in heaven,\nfrom whence, in the revolutions of ages, they are again sent into pure\nbodies; while the souls of those whose hands have acted madly against themselves\nare received by the darkest place in Hades, and while God, who is their\nFather, punishes those that offend against either of them in their posterity?\nfor which reason God hates such doings, and the crime is punished by our\nmost wise legislator. Accordingly, our laws determine that the bodies of\nsuch as kill themselves should be exposed till the sun be set, without\nburial, although at the same time it be allowed by them to be lawful to\nbury our enemies [sooner]. The laws of other nations also enjoin such men's\nhands to be cut off when they are dead, which had been made use of in destroying\nthemselves when alive, while they reckoned that as the body is alien from\nthe soul, so is the hand alien from the body. It is therefore, my friends,\na right thing to reason justly, and not add to the calamities which men\nbring upon us impiety towards our Creator. If we have a mind to preserve\nourselves, let us do it; for to be preserved by those our enemies, to whom\nwe have given so many demonstrations of our courage, is no way inglorious;\nbut if we have a mind to die, it is good to die by the hand of those that\nhave conquered us. For nay part, I will not run over to our enemies' quarters,\nin order to be a traitor to myself; for certainly I should then be much\nmore foolish than those that deserted to the enemy, since they did it in\norder to save themselves, and I should do it for destruction, for my own\ndestruction. However, I heartily wish the Romans may prove treacherous\nin this matter; for if, after their offer of their right hand for security,\nI be slain by them, I shall die cheerfully, and carry away with me the\nsense of their perfidiousness, as a consolation greater than victory itself.\""}, "Now these and many the like motives did Josephus use to these men\nto prevent their murdering themselves; but desperation had shut their ears,\nas having long ago devoted themselves to die, and they were irritated at\nJosephus. They then ran upon him with their swords in their hands, one\nfrom one quarter, and another from another, and called him a coward, and\neveryone of them appeared openly as if he were ready to smite him; but\nhe calling to one of them by name, and looking like a general to another,\nand taking a third by the hand, and making a fourth ashamed of himself,\nby praying him to forbear, and being in this condition distracted with\nvarious passions, (as he well might in the great distress he was then in,)\nhe kept off every one of their swords from killing him, and was forced\nto do like such wild beasts as are encompassed about on every side, who\nalways turn themselves against those that last touched them. Nay, some\nof their right hands were debilitated by the reverence they bare to their\ngeneral in these his fatal calamities, and their swords dropped out of\ntheir hands; and not a few of them there were, who, when they aimed to\nsmite him with their swords, they were not thoroughly either willing or\nable to do it.", "However, in this extreme distress, he was not destitute of his usual\nsagacity; but trusting himself to the providence of God, he put his life\ninto hazard [in the manner following]: \"And now,\" said he, \"since\nit is resolved among you that you will die, come on, let us commit our\nmutual deaths to determination by lot. He whom the lot falls to first,\nlet him be killed by him that hath the second lot, and thus fortune shall\nmake its progress through us all; nor shall any of us perish by his own\nright hand, for it would be unfair if, when the rest are gone, somebody\nshould repent and save himself.\" This proposal appeared to them to\nbe very just; and when he had prevailed with them to determine this matter\nby lots, he drew one of the lots for himself also. He who had the first\nlot laid his neck bare to him that had the next, as supposing that the\ngeneral would die among them immediately; for they thought death, if Josephus\nmight but die with them, was sweeter than life; yet was he with another\nleft to the last, whether we must say it happened so by chance, or whether\nby the providence of God. And as he was very desirous neither to be condemned\nby the lot, nor, if he had been left to the last, to imbrue his right hand\nin the blood of his countrymen, he persuaded him to trust his fidelity\nto him, and to live as well as himself.", "Thus Josephus escaped in the war with the Romans, and in this his\nown war with his friends, and was led by Nicanor to Vespasian. But now\nall the Romans ran together to see him; and as the multitude pressed one\nupon another about their general, there was a tumult of a various kind;\nwhile some rejoiced that Josephus was taken, and some threatened him, and\nsome crowded to see him very near; but those that were more remote cried\nout to have this their enemy put to death, while those that were near called\nto mind the actions he had done, and a deep concern appeared at the change\nof his fortune. Nor were there any of the Roman commanders, how much soever\nthey had been enraged at him before, but relented when they came to the\nsight of him. Above all the rest, Titus's own valor, and Josephus's own\npatience under his afflictions, made him pity him, as did also the commiseration\nof his age, when he recalled to mind that but a little while ago he was\nfighting, but lay now in the hands of his enemies, which made him consider\nthe power of fortune, and how quick is the turn of affairs in war, and\nhow no state of men is sure; for which reason he then made a great many\nmore to be of the same pitiful temper with himself, and induced them to\ncommiserate Josephus. He was also of great weight in persuading his father\nto preserve him. However, Vespasian gave strict orders that he should be\nkept with great caution, as though he would in a very little time send\nhim to Nero.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "I\ndo not know where to find the law of Moses here mentioned by Josephus,\nand afterwards by Eleazar, 13.

When therefore\nthey were all ordered to withdraw, excepting Titus and two of their friends,\nhe said, \"Thou, O Vespasian, thinkest no more than that thou hast\ntaken Josephus himself captive; but I come to thee as a messenger of greater\ntidings; for had not I been sent by God to thee, I knew what was the law\nof the Jews in this case?\nand how it becomes generals to die. Dost thou send me to Nero? For\nwhy? Are Nero's successors till they come to thee still alive? Thou, O\nVespasian, art Caesar and emperor, thou, and this thy son. Bind me now\nstill faster, and keep me for thyself, for thou, O Caesar, are not only\nlord over me, but over the land and the sea, and all mankind; and certainly\nI deserve to be kept in closer custody than I now am in, in order to be\npunished, if I rashly affirm any thing of God.\" When he had said this,\nVespasian at present did not believe him, but supposed that Josephus said\nthis as a cunning trick, in order to his own preservation; but in a little\ntime he was convinced, and believed what he said to be true, God himself\nerecting his expectations, so as to think of obtaining the empire, and\nby other signs fore-showing his advancement. He also found Josephus to\nhave spoken truth on other occasions; for one of those friends that were\npresent at that secret conference said to Josephus, \"I cannot but\nwonder how thou couldst not foretell to the people of Jotapata that they\nshould be taken, nor couldst foretell this captivity which hath happened\nto thyself, unless what thou now sayest be a vain thing, in order to avoid\nthe rage that is risen against thyself.\" To which Josephus replied,\n\"I did foretell to the people of Jotapata that they would be taken\non the forty-seventh day, and that I should be caught alive by the Romans.\"\nNow when Vespasian had inquired of the captives privately about these predictions,\nhe found them to be true, and then he began to believe those that concerned\nhimself. Yet did he not set Josephus at liberty from his hands, but bestowed\non him suits of clothes, and other precious gifts; he treated him also\nin a very obliging manner, and continued so to do, Titus still joining\nhis interest ill the honors that were done him."}, "NOW Vespasian returned to Ptolemais on the fourth day of the month\nPanemus, [Tamus] and from thence he came to Cesarea, which lay by the sea-side.\nThis was a very great city of Judea, and for the greatest part inhabited\nby Greeks: the citizens here received both the Roman army and its general,\nwith all sorts of acclamations and rejoicings, and this partly out of the\ngood-will they bore to the Romans, but principally out of the hatred they\nbore to those that were conquered by them; on which account they came clamoring\nagainst Josephus in crowds, and desired he might be put to death. But Vespasian\npassed over this petition concerning him, as offered by the injudicious\nmultitude, with a bare silence. Two of the legions also he placed at Cesarea,\nthat they might there take their winter-quarters, as perceiving the city\nvery fit for such a purpose; but he placed the tenth and the fifth at Scythopolis,\nthat he might not distress Cesarea with the entire army. This place was\nwarm even in winter, as it was suffocating hot in the summer time, by reason\nof its situation in a plain, and near to the sea [of Galilee].", "In the mean time, there were gathered together as well such as had\nseditiously got out from among their enemies, as those that had escaped\nout of the demolished cities, which were in all a great number, and repaired\nJoppa, which had been left desolate by Cestius, that it might serve them\nfor a place of refuge; and because the adjoining region had been laid waste\nin the war, and was not capable of supporting them, they determined to\ngo off to sea. They also built themselves a great many piratical ships,\nand turned pirates upon the seas near to Syria, and Phoenicia, and Egypt,\nand made those seas unnavigable to all men. Now as soon as Vespasian knew\nof their conspiracy, he sent both footmen and horsemen to Joppa, which\nwas unguarded in the night time; however, those that were in it perceived\nthat they should be attacked, and were afraid of it; yet did they not endeavor\nto keep the Romans out, but fled to their ships, and lay at sea all night,\nout of the reach of their darts.", "Now Joppa is not naturally a haven, for it ends in a rough shore,\nwhere all the rest of it is straight, but the two ends bend towards each\nother, where there are deep precipices, and great stones that jut out into\nthe sea, and where the chains wherewith Andromeda was bound have left their\nfootsteps, which attest to the antiquity of that fable. But the north wind\nopposes and beats upon the shore, and dashes mighty waves against the rocks\nwhich receive them, and renders the haven more dangerous than the country\nthey had deserted. Now as those people of Joppa were floating about in\nthis sea, in the morning there fell a violent wind upon them; it is called\nby those that sail there \"the black north wind,\" and there dashed\ntheir ships one against another, and dashed some of them against the rocks,\nand carried many of them by force, while they strove against the opposite\nwaves, into the main sea; for the shore was so rocky, and had so many of\nthe enemy upon it, that they were afraid to come to land; nay, the waves\nrose so very high, that they drowned them; nor was there any place whither\nthey could fly, nor any way to save themselves; while they were thrust\nout of the sea, by the violence of the wind, if they staid where they were,\nand out of the city by the violence of the Romans. And much lamentation\nthere was when the ships were dashed against one another, and a terrible\nnoise when they were broken to pieces; and some of the multitude that were\nin them were covered with waves, and so perished, and a great many were\nembarrassed with shipwrecks. But some of them thought that to die by their\nown swords was lighter than by the sea, and so they killed themselves before\nthey were drowned; although the greatest part of them were carried by the\nwaves, and dashed to pieces against the abrupt parts of the rocks, insomuch\nthat the sea was bloody a long way, and the maritime parts were full of\ndead bodies; for the Romans came upon those that were carried to the shore,\nand destroyed them; and the number of the bodies that were thus thrown\nout of the sea was four thousand and two hundred. The Romans also took\nthe city without opposition, and utterly demolished it.", "And thus was Joppa taken twice by the Romans in a little time; but\nVespasian, in order to prevent these pirates from coming thither any more,\nerected a camp there, where the citadel of Joppa had been, and left a body\nof horse in it, with a few footmen, that these last might stay there and\nguard the camp, and the horsemen might spoil the country that lay round\nit, and might destroy the neighboring villages and smaller cities.

However, the truth was known by degrees,\nfrom the places near Jotapata, and appeared to all to be too true. Yet\nwere there fictitious stories added to what was really done; for it was\nreported that Josephus was slain at the taking of the city, which piece\nof news filled Jerusalem full of sorrow. In every house also, and among\nall to whom any of the slain were allied, there was a lamentation for them;\nbut the mourning for the commander was a public one; and some mourned for\nthose that had lived with them, others for their kindred, others for their\nfriends, and others for their brethren, but all mourned for Josephus; insomuch\nthat the lamentation did not cease in the city before the thirtieth day;\nand a great many hired mourners, \nwith their pipes, who should begin the melancholy ditties for them."}, "But as the truth came out in time, it appeared how the affairs of\nJotapata really stood; yet was it found that the death of Josephus was\na fiction; and when they understood that he was alive, and was among the\nRomans, and that the commanders treated him at another rate than they treated\ncaptives, they were as vehemently angry at him now as they had showed their\ngood-will before, when he appeared to have been dead. He was also abused\nby some as having been a coward, and by others as a deserter; and the city\nwas full of indignation at him, and of reproaches cast upon him; their\nrage was also aggravated by their afflictions, and more inflamed by their\nill success; and what usually becomes an occasion of caution to wise men,\nI mean affliction, became a spur to them to venture on further calamities,\nand the end of one misery became still the beginning of another; they therefore\nresolved to fall on the Romans the more vehemently, as resolving to be\nrevenged on him in revenging themselves on the Romans.

But as soon as he was informed\nthat Tiberias was fond of innovations, and that Tarichere had revolted,\nboth which cities were parts of the kingdom of Agrippa, and was satisfied\nwithin himself that the Jews were every where perverted [from their obedience\nto their governors], he thought it seasonable to make an expedition against\nthese cities, and that for the sake of Agrippa, and in order to bring his\ncities to reason. So he sent away his son Titus to [the other] Cesarea,\nthat he might bring the army that lay there to Seythopous, which is the\nlargest city of Decapolis, and in the neighborhood of Tiberias, whither\nhe came, and where he waited for his son. He then came with three legions,\nand pitched his camp thirty furlongs off Tiberias, at a certain station\neasily seen by the innovators; it is named Sennabris. He also sent Valerian,\na decurion, with fifty horsemen, to speak peaceably to those that were\nin the city, and to exhort them to give him assurances of their fidelity;\nfor he had heard that the people were desirous of peace, but were obliged\nby some of the seditious part to join with them, and so were forced to\nfight for them. When Valerian had marched up to the place, and was near\nthe wall, he alighted off his horse, and made those that were with him\nto do the same, that they might not be thought to come to skirmish with\nthem; but before they could come to a discourse one with another, the most\npotent men among the seditious made a sally upon them armed; their leader\nwas one whose name was Jesus, the son of Shaphat, the principal head of\na band of robbers. Now Valerian, neither thinking it safe to fight contrary\nto the commands of the general, though he were secure of a victory, and\nknowing that it was a very hazardous undertaking for a few to fight with\nmany, for those that were unprovided to fight those that were ready, and\nbeing on other accounts surprised at this unexpected onset of the Jews,\nhe ran away on foot, as did five of the rest in like manner, and left their\nhorses behind them; which horses Jesus led away into the city, and rejoiced\nas if they had taken them in battle, and not by treachery."}, "Now the seniors of the people, and such as were of principal authority\namong them, fearing what would be the issue of this matter, fled to the\ncamp of the Romans; they then took their king along with them, and fell\ndown before Vespasian, to supplicate his favor, and besought him not to\noverlook them, nor to impute the madness of a few to the whole city, to\nspare a people that have been ever civil and obliging to the Romans; but\nto bring the authors of this revolt to due punishment, who had hitherto\nso watched them, that though they were zealous to give them the security\nof their right hands of a long time, yet could they not accomplish the\nsame. With these supplications the general complied, although he were very\nangry at the whole city about the carrying off his horses, and this because\nhe saw that Agrippa was under a great concern for them. So when Vespasian\nand Agrippa had accepted of their right hands by way of security, Jesus\nand his party thought it not safe for them to continue at Tiberias, so\nthey ran away to Tarichete. The next day Vespasian sent Trajan before with\nsome horsemen to the citadel, to make trial of the multitude, whether they\nwere all disposed for peace; and as soon as he knew that the people were\nof the same mind with the petitioner, he took his army, and went to the\ncity; upon which the citizens opened to him their gates, and met him with\nacclamations of joy, and called him their savior and benefactor. But as\nthe army was a great while in getting in at the gates, they were so narrow,\nVespasian commanded the south wall to be broken down, and so made a broad\npassage for their entrance. However, he charged them to abstain from rapine\nand injustice, in order to gratify the king; and on his account spared\nthe rest of the wall, while the king undertook for them that they should\ncontinue [faithful to the Romans] for the time to come. And thus did he\nrestore this city to a quiet state, after it had been grievously afflicted\nby the sedition.", {"term": "Lake\nof Gennesareth", "#text": "AND now Vespasian pitched his camp between this city and Taricheae,\nbut fortified his camp more strongly, as suspecting that he should be forced\nto stay there, and have a long war; for all the innovators had gotten together\nat Taricheae, as relying upon the strength of the city, and on the lake\nthat lay by it. This lake is called by the people of the country the . The city itself is situated like Tiberias, at the bottom\nof a mountain, and on those sides which are not washed by the sea, had\nbeen strongly fortified by Josephus, though not so strongly as Tiberias;\nfor the wall of Tiberias had been built at the beginning of the Jews' revolt,\nwhen he had great plenty of money, and great power, but Tarichese partook\nonly the remains of that liberality, Yet had they a great number of ships\ngotten ready upon the lake, that, in case they were beaten at land, they\nmight retire to them; and they were so fitted up, that they might undertake\na Sea-fight also. But as the Romans were building a wall about their camp,\nJesu and his party were neither affrighted at their number, nor at the\ngood order they were in, but made a sally upon them; and at the very first\nonset the builders of the wall were dispersed; and these pulled what little\nthey had before built to pieces; but as soon as they saw the armed men\ngetting together, and before they had suffered any thing themselves, they\nretired to their own men. But then the Romans pursued them, and drove them\ninto their ships, where they launched out as far as might give them the\nopportunity of reaching the Romans with what they threw at them, and then\ncast anchor, and brought their ships close, as in a line of battle, and\nthence fought the enemy from the sea, who were themselves at land. But\nVespasian hearing that a great multitude of them were gotten together in\nthe plain that was before the city, he thereupon sent his son, with six\nhundred chosen horsemen, to disperse them."}, "But when Titus perceived that the enemy was very numerous, he sent\nto his father, and informed him that he should want more forces. But as\nhe saw a great many of the horsemen eager to fight, and that before any\nsuccors could come to them, and that yet some of them were privately under\na sort of consternation at the multitude of the Jews, he stood in a place\nwhence he might be heard, and said to them, \"My brave Romans! for\nit is right for me to put you in mind of what nation you are, in the beginning\nof my speech, that so you may not be ignorant who you are, and who they\nare against whom we are going to fight. For as to us, Romans, no part of\nthe habitable earth hath been able to escape our hands hitherto; but as\nfor the Jews, that I may speak of them too, though they have been already\nbeaten, yet do they not give up the cause; and a sad thing it would be\nfor us to grow wealthy under good success, when they bear up under their\nmisfortunes. As to the alacrity which you show publicly, I see it, and\nrejoice at it; yet am I afraid lest the multitude of the enemy should bring\na concealed fright upon some of you: let such a one consider again, who\nwe are that are to fight, and who those are against whom we are to fight.\nNow these Jews, though they be very bold and great despisers of death,\nare but a disorderly body, and unskillful in war, and may rather be called\na rout than an army; while I need say nothing of our skill and our good\norder; for this is the reason why we Romans alone are exercised for war\nin time of peace, that we may not think of number for number when we come\nto fight with our enemies: for what advantage should we reap by our continual\nsort of warfare, if we must still be equal in number to such as have not\nbeen used to war. Consider further, that you are to have a conflict with\nmen in effect unarmed, while you are well armed; with footmen, while you\nare horsemen; with those that have no good general, while you have one;\nand as these advantages make you in effect manifold more than you are,\nso do their disadvantages mightily diminish their number. Now it is not\nthe multitude of men, though they be soldiers, that manages wars with success,\nbut it is their bravery that does it, though they be but a few; for a few\nare easily set in battle-array, and can easily assist one another, while\nover-numerous armies are more hurt by themselves than by their enemies.\nIt is boldness and rashness, the effects of madness, that conduct the Jews.\nThose passions indeed make a great figure when they succeed, but are quite\nextinguished upon the least ill success; but we are led on by courage,\nand obedience, and fortitude, which shows itself indeed in our good fortune,\nbut still does not for ever desert us in our ill fortune. Nay, indeed,\nyour fighting is to be on greater motives than those of the Jews; for although\nthey run the hazard of war for liberty, and for their country, yet what\ncan be a greater motive to us than glory? and that. it may never be said,\nthat after we have got dominion of the habitable earth, the Jews are able\nto confront us. We must also reflect upon this, that there is no fear of\nour suffering any incurable disaster in the present case; for those that\nare ready to assist us are many, and at hand also; yet it is in our power\nto seize upon this victory ourselves; and I think we ought to prevent the\ncoming of those my father is sending to us for our assistance, that our\nsuccess may be peculiar to ourselves, and of greater reputation to us.\nAnd I cannot but think this an opportunity wherein my father, and I, and\nyou shall be all put to the trial, whether he be worthy of his former glorious\nperformances, whether I be his son in reality, and whether you be really\nmy soldiers; for it is usual for my father to conquer; and for myself,\nI should not bear the thoughts of returning to him if I were once taken\nby the enemy. And how will you be able to avoid being ashamed, if you do\nnot show equal courage with your commander, when he goes before you into\ndanger? For you know very well that I shall go into the danger first, and\nmake the first attack upon the enemy. Do not you therefore desert me, but\npersuade yourselves that God will be assisting to my onset. Know this also\nbefore we begin, that we shall now have better success than we should have,\nif we were to fight at a distance.\"", "As Titus was saying this, an extraordinary fury fell upon the men;\nand as Trajan was already come before the fight began, with four hundred\nhorsemen, they were uneasy at it, because the reputation of the victory\nwould be diminished by being common to so many. Vespasian had also sent\nboth Antonius and Silo, with two thousand archers, and had given it them\nin charge to seize upon the mountain that was over against the city, and\nrepel those that were upon the wall; which archers did as they were commanded,\nand prevented those that attempted to assist them that way; And now Titus\nmade his own horse march first against the enemy, as did the others with\na great noise after him, and extended themselves upon the plain as wide\nas the enemy which confronted them; by which means they appeared much more\nnumerous than they really were. Now the Jews, although they were surprised\nat their onset, and at their good order, made resistance against their\nattacks for a little while; but when they were pricked with their long\npoles, and overborne by the violent noise of the horsemen, they came to\nbe trampled under their feet; many also of them were slain on every side,\nwhich made them disperse themselves, and run to the city, as fast as every\none of them were able. So Titus pressed upon the hindmost, and slew them;\nand of the rest, some he fell upon as they stood on heaps, and some he\nprevented, and met them in the mouth, and run them through; many also he\nleaped upon as they fell one upon another, and trod them down, and cut\noff all the retreat they had to the wall, and turned them back into the\nplain, till at last they forced a passage by their multitude, and got away,\nand ran into the city.", "But now there fell out a terrible sedition among them within the\ncity; for the inhabitants themselves, who had possessions there, and to\nwhom the city belonged, were not disposed to fight from the very beginning;\nand now the less so, because they had been beaten; but the foreigners,\nwhich were very numerous, would force them to fight so much the more, insomuch\nthat there was a clamor and a tumult among them, as all mutually angry\none at another. And when Titus heard this tumult, for he was not far from\nthe wall, he cried out,\" Fellow soldiers, now is the time; and why\ndo we make any delay, when God is giving up the Jews to us? Take the victory\nwhich is given you: do not you hear what a noise they make? Those that\nhave escaped our hands are ill an uproar against one another. We have the\ncity if we make haste; but besides haste, we must undergo some labor, and\nuse some courage; for no great thing uses to be accomplished without danger:\naccordingly, we must not only prevent their uniting again, which necessity\nwill soon compel them to do, but we must also prevent the coming of our\nown men to our assistance, that, as few as we are, we may conquer so great\na multitude, and may ourselves alone take the city:\"", "As soon as ever Titus had said this, he leaped upon his horse, and\nrode apace down to the lake; by which lake he marched, and entered into\nthe city the first of them all, as did the others soon after him. Hereupon\nthose that were upon the walls were seized with a terror at the boldness\nof the attempt, nor durst any one venture to fight with him, or to hinder\nhim; so they left guarding the city, and some of those that were about\nJesus fled over the country, while others of them ran down to the lake,\nand met the enemy in the teeth, and some were slain as they were getting\nup into the ships, but others of them as they attempted to overtake those\nthat were already gone aboard. There was also a great slaughter made in\nthe city, while those foreigners that had not fled away already made opposition;\nbut the natural inhabitants were killed without fighting: for in hopes\nof Titus's giving them his right hand for their security, and out of a\nconsciousness that they had not given any consent to the war, they avoided\nfighting, till Titus had slain the authors of this revolt, and then put\na stop to any further slaughters, out of commiseration of these inhabitants\nof the place. But for those that had fled to the lake, upon seeing the\ncity taken, they sailed as far as they possibly could from the enemy.", "Hereupon Titus sent one of his horsemen to his father, and let him\nknow the good news of what he had done; at which, as was natural, he was\nvery joyful, both on account of the courage and glorious actions of his\nson; for he thought that now the greatest part of the war was over. He\nthen came thither himself, and set men to guard the city, and gave them\ncommand to take care that nobody got privately out of it, but to kill such\nas attempted so to do. And on the next day he went down to the lake, and\ncommanded that vessels should be fitted up, in order to pursue those that\nhad escaped in the ships. These vessels were quickly gotten ready accordingly,\nbecause there was great plenty of materials, and a great number of artificers\nalso.", "Now this lake of Gennesareth is so called from the country adjoining\nto it. Its breadth is forty furlongs, and its length one hundred and forty;\nits waters are sweet, and very agreeable for drinking, for they are finer\nthan the thick waters of other fens; the lake is also pure, and on every\nside ends directly at the shores, and at the sand; it is also of a temperate\nnature when you draw it up, and of a more gentle nature than river or fountain\nwater, and yet always cooler than one could expect in so diffuse a place\nas this is. Now when this water is kept in the open air, it is as cold\nas that snow which the country people are accustomed to make by night in\nsummer. There are several kinds of fish in it, different both to the taste\nand the sight from those elsewhere. It is divided into two parts by the\nriver Jordan. Now Panium is thought to be the fountain of Jordan, but in\nreality it is carried thither after an occult manner from the place called\nPhiala: this place lies as you go up to Trachonitis, and is a hundred and\ntwenty furlongs from Cesarea, and is not far out of the road on the right\nhand; and indeed it hath its name of Phiala [vial or bowl] very justly,\nfrom the roundness of its circumference, as being round like a wheel; its\nwater continues always up to its edges, without either sinking or running\nover. And as this origin of Jordan was formerly not known, it was discovered\nso to be when Philip was tetrarch of Trachonitis; for he had chaff thrown\ninto Phiala, and it was found at Paninto, where the ancients thought the\nfountain-head of the river was, whither it had been therefore carried [by\nthe waters]. As for Panium itself, its natural beauty had been improved\nby the royal liberality of Agrippa, and adorned at his expenses. Now Jordan's\nvisible stream arises from this cavern, and divides the marshes and fens\nof the lake Semechonitis; when it hath run another hundred and twenty furlongs,\nit first passes by the city Julias, and then passes through the middle\nof the lake Gennesareth; after which it runs a long way over a desert,\nand then makes its exit into the lake Asphaltitis.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "It\nmay be worth our while to observe here, that near this lake of Gennesareth\ngrapes and figs hang on the trees ten months of the year.

The people of the country call it Capharnaum.\nSome have thought it to be a vein of the Nile, because it produces the\nCoracin fish as well as that lake does which is near to Alexandria. The\nlength of this country extends itself along the banks of this lake that\nbears the same name for thirty furlongs, and is in breadth twenty, And\nthis is the nature of that place."}, "But now, when the vessels were gotten ready, Vespasian put upon ship-board\nas many of his forces as he thought sufficient to be too hard for those\nthat were upon the lake, and set sail after them. Now these which were\ndriven into the lake could neither fly to the land, where all was in their\nenemies' hand, and in war against them; nor could they fight upon the level\nby sea, for their ships were small and fitted only for piracy; they were\ntoo weak to fight with Vespasian's vessels, and the mariners that were\nin them were so few, that they were afraid to come near the Romans, who\nattacked them in great numbers. However, as they sailed round about the\nvessels, and sometimes as they came near them, they threw stones at the\nRomans when they were a good way off, or came closer and fought them; yet\ndid they receive the greatest harm themselves in both cases. As for the\nstones they threw at the Romans, they only made a sound one after another,\nfor they threw them against such as were in their armor, while the Roman\ndarts could reach the Jews themselves; and when they ventured to come near\nthe Romans, they became sufferers themselves before they could do any harm\nto the ether, and were drowned, they and their ships together. As for those\nthat endeavored to come to an actual fight, the Romans ran many of them\nthrough with their long poles. Sometimes the Romans leaped into their ships,\nwith swords in their hands, and slew them; but when some of them met the\nvessels, the Romans caught them by the middle, and destroyed at once their\nships and themselves who were taken in them. And for such as were drowning\nin the sea, if they lifted their heads up above the water, they were either\nkilled by darts, or caught by the vessels; but if, in the desperate case\nthey were in, they attempted to swim to their enemies, the Romans cut off\neither their heads or their hands; and indeed they were destroyed after\nvarious manners every where, till the rest being put to flight, were forced\nto get upon the land, while the vessels encompassed them about [on the\nsea]: but as many of these were repulsed when they were getting ashore,\nthey were killed by the darts upon the lake; and the Romans leaped out\nof their vessels, and destroyed a great many more upon the land: one might\nthen see the lake all bloody, and full of dead bodies, for not one of them\nescaped. And a terrible stink, and a very sad sight there was on the following\ndays over that country; for as for the shores, they were full of shipwrecks,\nand of dead bodies all swelled; and as the dead bodies were inflamed by\nthe sun, and putrefied, they corrupted the air, insomuch that the misery\nwas not only the object of commiseration to the Jews, but to those that\nhated them, and had been the authors of that misery. This was the upshot\nof the sea-fight.

Nor indeed did Titus now give his consent, so far as appears,\nnor ever act of himself so barbarously; nay, soon after this, Titus grew\nquite weary of shedding blood, and of punishing the innocent with the guilty,\nand gave the people of Gischala leave to keep the Jewish sabbath, B. IV.\nch. 2. sect. 3, 5, in the midst of their siege. Nor was Vespasian disposed\nto do what he did, till his officers persuaded him, and that from two principal\ntopics, viz. that nothing could be unjust that was done against Jews; and\nthat when both cannot be consistent, advantage must prevail over justice.\nAdmirable court doctrines these!"}, "#text": "After this fight was over, Vespasian sat upon his tribunal at Taricheae,\nin order to distinguish the foreigners from the old inhabitants; for those\nforeigners appear to have begun the war. So he deliberated with the other\ncommanders, whether he ought to save those old inhabitants or not. And\nwhen those commanders alleged that the dismission of them would be to his\nown disadvantage, because, when they were once set at liberty, they would\nnot be at rest, since they would be people destitute of proper habitations,\nand would he able to compel such as they fled to fight against us, Vespasian\nacknowledged that they did not deserve to be saved, and that if they had\nleave given them to fly away, they would make use of it against those that\ngave them that leave. But still he considered with himself after what manner\nthey should be slain \nfor if he had them slain there, he suspected the people of the country\nwould thereby become his enemies; for that to be sure they would never\nbear it, that so many that had been supplicants to him should be killed;\nand to offer violence to them, after he had given them assurances of their\nlives, he could not himself bear to do it. However, his friends were too\nhard for him, and pretended that nothing against Jews could be any impiety,\nand that he ought to prefer what was profitable before what was fit to\nbe done, where both could not be made consistent. So he gave them an ambiguous\nliberty to do as they advised, and permitted the prisoners to go along\nno other road than that which led to Tiberias only. So they readily believed\nwhat they desired to be true, and went along securely, with their effects,\nthe way which was allowed them, while the Romans seized upon all the road\nthat led to Tiberias, that none of them might go out of it, and shut them\nup in the city. Then came Vespasian, and ordered them all to stand in the\nstadium, and commanded them to kill the old men, together with the others\nthat were useless, which were in number a thousand and two hundred. Out\nof the young men he chose six thousand of the strongest, and sent them\nto Nero, to dig through the Isthmus, and sold the remainder for slaves,\nbeing thirty thousand and four hundred, besides such as he made a present\nof to Agrippa; for as to those that belonged to his kingdom, he gave him\nleave to do what he pleased with them; however, the king sold these also\nfor slaves; but for the rest of the multitude, who were Trachonites, and\nGaulanites, and of Hippos, and some of Gadara, the greatest part of them\nwere seditious persons and fugitives, who were of such shameful characters,\nthat they preferred war before peace.

This city lay Upon the borders of Agrippa's kingdom,\nas also did Sogana and Scleucia. And these were both parts of Gaulanitis;\nfor Sogana was a part of that called the Upper Gaulanitis, as was Gamala\nof the Lower; while Selcucia was situated at the lake Semechouitis, which\nlake is thirty furlongs in breadth, and sixty in length; its marshes reach\nas far as the place Daphne, which in other respects is a delicious place,\nand hath such fountains as supply water to what is called Little Jordan,\nunder the temple of the golden calf, \nwhere it is sent into Great Jordan. Now Agrippa had united Sogana and Seleucia\nby leagues to himself, at the very beginning of the revolt from the Romans;\nyet did not Gamala accede to them, but relied upon the difficulty of the\nplace, which was greater than that of Jotapata, for it was situated upon\na rough ridge of a high mountain, with a kind of neck in the middle: where\nit begins to ascend, it lengthens itself, and declines as much downward\nbefore as behind, insomuch that it is like a camel in figure, from whence\nit is so named, although the people of the country do not pronounce it\naccurately. Both on the side and the face there are abrupt parts divided\nfrom the rest, and ending in vast deep valleys; yet are the parts behind,\nwhere they are joined to the mountain, somewhat easier of ascent than the\nother; but then the people belonging to the place have cut an oblique ditch\nthere, and made that hard to be ascended also. On its acclivity, which\nis straight, houses are built, and those very thick and close to one another.\nThe city also hangs so strangely, that it looks as if it would fall down\nupon itself, so sharp is it at the top. It is exposed to the south, and\nits southern mount, which reaches to an immense height, was in the nature\nof a citadel to the city; and above that was a precipice, not walled about,\nbut extending itself to an immense depth. There was also a spring of water\nwithin the wall, at the utmost limits of the city."}, "As this city was naturally hard to be taken, so had Josephus, by\nbuilding a wall about it, made it still stronger, as also by ditches and\nmines under ground. The people that were in it were made more bold by the\nnature of the place than the people of Jotapata had been, but it had much\nfewer fighting men in it; and they had such a confidence in the situation\nof the place, that they thought the enemy could not be too many for them;\nfor the city had been filled with those that had fled to it for safety,\non account of its strength; on which account they had been able to resist\nthose whom Agrippa sent to besiege it for seven months together.", "But Vespasian removed from Emmaus, where he had last pitched his\ncamp before the city Tiberias, (now Emmaus, if it be interpreted, may be\nrendered \"a warm bath,\" for therein is a spring of warm water,\nuseful for healing,) and came to Gamala; yet was its situation such that\nhe was not able to encompass it all round with soldiers to watch it; but\nwhere the places were practicable, he set men to watch it, and seized upon\nthe mountain which was over it. And as the legions, according to their\nusual custom, were fortifying their camp upon that mountain, he began to\ncast up banks at the bottom, at the part towards the east, where the highest\ntower of the whole city was, and where the fifteenth legion pitched their\ncamp; while the fifth legion did duty over against the midst of the city,\nand whilst the tenth legion filled up the ditches and the valleys. Now\nat this time it was that as king Agrippa was come nigh the walls, and was\nendeavoring to speak to those that were on the walls about a surrender,\nhe was hit with a stone on his right elbow by one of the slingers; he was\nthen immediately surrounded with his own men. But the Romans were excited\nto set about the siege, by their indignation on the king's account, and\nby their fear on their own account, as concluding that those men would\nomit no kinds of barbarity against foreigners and enemies, who where so\nenraged against one of their own nation, and one that advised them to nothing\nbut what was for their own advantage.", "Now when the banks were finished, which was done on the sudden, both\nby the multitude of hands, and by their being accustomed to such work,\nthey brought the machines; but Chares and Joseph, who were the most potent\nmen in the city, set their armed men in order, though already in a fright,\nbecause they did not suppose that the city could hold out long, since they\nhad not a sufficient quantity either of water, or of other necessaries.\nHowever, these their leaders encouraged them, and brought them out upon\nthe wall, and for a while indeed they drove away those that were bringing\nthe machines; but when those machines threw darts and stones at them, they\nretired into the city; then did the Romans bring battering rams to three\nseveral places, and made the wall shake [and fall]. They then poured in\nover the parts of the wall that were thrown down, with a mighty sound of\ntrumpets and noise of armor, and with a shout of the soldiers, and brake\nin by force upon those that were in the city; but these men fell upon the\nRomans for some time, at their first entrance, and prevented their going\nany further, and with great courage beat them back; and the Romans were\nso overpowered by the greater multitude of the people, who beat them on\nevery side, that they were obliged to run into the upper parts of the city.\nWhereupon the people turned about, and fell upon their enemies, who had\nattacked them, and thrust them down to the lower parts, and as they were\ndistressed by the narrowness and difficulty of the place, slew them; and\nas these Romans could neither beat those back that were above them, nor\nescape the force of their own men that were forcing their way forward,\nthey were compelled to fly into their enemies' houses, which were low;\nbut these houses being thus full, of soldiers, whose weight they could\nnot bear, fell down suddenly; and when one house fell, it shook down a\ngreat many of those that were under it, as did those do to such as were\nunder them. By this means a vast number of the Romans perished; for they\nwere so terribly distressed, that although they saw the houses subsiding,\nthey were compelled to leap upon the tops of them; so that a great many\nwere ground to powder by these ruins, and a great many of those that got\nfrom under them lost some of their limbs, but still a greater number were\nsuffocated by the dust that arose from those ruins. The people of Gamala\nsupposed this to be an assistance afforded them by God, and without regarding\nwhat damage they suffered themselves, they pressed forward, and thrust\nthe enemy upon the tops of their houses; and when they stumbled in the\nsharp and narrow streets, and were perpetually falling down, they threw\ntheir stones or darts at them, and slew them. Now the very ruins afforded\nthem stones enow; and for iron weapons, the dead men of the enemies' side\nafforded them what they wanted; for drawing the swords of those that were\ndead, they made use of them to despatch such as were only half dead; nay,\nthere were a great number who, upon their falling down from the tops of\nthe houses, stabbed themselves, and died after that manner; nor indeed\nwas it easy for those that were beaten back to fly away; for they were\nso unacquainted with the ways, and the dust was so thick, that they wandered\nabout without knowing one another, and fell down dead among the crowd.", "Those therefore that were able to find the ways out of the city retired.\nBut now Vespasian always staid among those that were hard set; for he was\ndeeply affected with seeing the ruins of the city falling upon his army,\nand forgot to take care of his own preservation. He went up gradually towards\nthe highest parts of the city before he was aware, and was left in the\nmidst of dangers, having only a very few with him; for even his son Titus\nwas not with him at that time, having been then sent into Syria to Mucianus.\nHowever, he thought it not safe to fly, nor did he esteem it a fit thing\nfor him to do; but calling to mind the actions he had done from his youth,\nand recollecting his courage, as if he had been excited by a divine fury,\nhe covered himself and those that were with him with their shields, and\nformed a testudo over both their bodies and their armor, and bore up against\nthe enemy's attacks, who came running down from the top of the city; and\nwithout showing any dread at the multitude of the men or of their darts,\nhe endured all, until the enemy took notice of that divine courage that\nwas within him, and remitted of their attacks; and when they pressed less\nzealously upon him, he retired, though without showing his back to them\ntill he was gotten out of the walls of the city. Now a great number of\nthe Romans fell in this battle, among whom was Ebutius, the decurion, a\nman who appeared not only in this engagement, wherein he fell, but every\nwhere, and in former engagements, to be of the truest courage, and one\nthat had done very great mischief to the Jews. But there was a centurion\nwhose name was Gallus, who, during this disorder, being encompassed about,\nhe and ten other soldiers privately crept into the house of a certain person,\nwhere he heard them talking at supper, what the people intended to do against\nthe Romans, or about themselves (for both the man himself and those with\nhim were Syrians). So he got up in the night time, and cut all their throats,\nand escaped, together with his soldiers, to the Romans.", "And now Vespasian comforted his army, which was much dejected by\nreflecting on their ill success, and because they had never before fallen\ninto such a calamity, and besides this, because they were greatly ashamed\nthat they had left their general alone in great dangers. As to what concerned\nhimself, he avoided to say any thing, that he might by no means seem to\ncomplain of it; but he said that \"we ought to bear manfully what usually\nfalls out in war, and this, by considering what the nature of war is, and\nhow it can never be that we must conquer without bloodshed on our own side;\nfor there stands about us that fortune which is of its own nature mutable;\nthat while they had killed so many ten thousands of the Jews, they had\nnow paid their small share of the reckoning to fate; and as it is the part\nof weak people to be too much puffed up with good success, so is it the\npart of cowards to be too much aftrighted at that which is ill; for the\nchange from the one to the other is sudden on both sides; and he is the\nbest warrior who is of a sober mind under misfortunes, that he may continue\nin that temper, and cheerfully recover what had been lost formerly; and\nas for what had now happened, it was neither owing to their own effeminacy,\nnor to the valor of the Jews, but the difficulty of the place was the occasion\nof their advantage, and of our disappointment. Upon reflecting on which\nmatter one might blame your zeal as perfectly ungovernable; for when the\nenemy had retired to their highest fastnesses, you ought to have restrained\nyourselves, and not, by presenting yourselves at the top of the city, to\nbe exposed to dangers; but upon your having obtained the lower parts of\nthe city, you ought to have provoked those that had retired thither to\na safe and settled battle; whereas, in rushing so hastily upon victory,\nyou took no care of your safety. But this incautiousness in war, and this\nmadness of zeal, is not a Roman maxim. While we perform all that we attempt\nby skill and good order, that procedure is the part of barbarians, and\nis what the Jews chiefly support themselves by. We ought therefore to return\nto our own virtue, and to be rather angry than any longer dejected at this\nunlucky misfortune, and let every one seek for his own consolation from\nhis own hand; for by this means he will avenge those that have been destroyed,\nand punish those that have killed them. For myself, I will endeavor, as\nI have now done, to go first before you against your enemies in every engagement,\nand to be the last that retires from it.\"", "So Vespasian encouraged his army by this speech; but for the people\nof Gamala, it happened that they took courage for a little while, upon\nsuch great and unaccountable success as they had had. But when they considered\nwith themselves that they had now no hopes of any terms of accommodation,\nand reflecting upon it that they could not get away, and that their provisions\nbegan already to be short, they were exceedingly cast down, and their courage\nfailed them; yet did they not neglect what might be for their preservation,\nso far as they were able, but the most courageous among them guarded those\nparts of the wall that were beaten down, while the more infirm did the\nsame to the rest of the wall that still remained round the city. And as\nthe Romans raised their banks, and attempted to get into the city a second\ntime, a great many of them fled out of the city through impracticable valleys,\nwhere no guards were placed, as also through subterraneous caverns; while\nthose that were afraid of being caught, and for that reason staid in the\ncity, perished for want of food; for what food they had was brought together\nfrom all quarters, and reserved for the fighting men.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "These\nnumbers in Josephus of thirty furlongs' ascent to the top of Mount Tabor,\nwhether we estimate it by winding and gradual, or by the perpendicular\naltitude, and of twenty-six furlongs' circumference upon the top, as also\nfifteen furlongs for this ascent in Polybius, with Geminus's perpendicular\naltitude of almost fourteen furlongs, here noted by Dr. Hudson, do none\nof' them agree with the authentic testimony of Mr. Maundrell, an eye-witness,\np. 112, who says he was not an hour in getting up to the top of this Mount\nTabor, and that the area of the top is an oval of about two furlongs in\nlength, and one in breadth. So I rather suppose Josephus wrote three furlongs\nfor the ascent or altitude, instead of thirty; and six furlongs for the\ncircumference at the top, instead of twenty-six,--since a mountain of only\nthree furlongs perpendicular altitude may easily require near an hour's\nascent, and the circumference of an oval of the foregoing quantity is near\nsix furlongs. Nor certainly could such a vast circumference as twenty-six\nfurlongs, or three miles and a quarter, at that height be encompassed with\na wall, including a trench and other fortifications, (perhaps those still\nremaining, ibid.) in the small interval of forty days, as Josephus here\nsays they were by himself."}, "#text": "And these were the hard circumstances that the people of Gamala were\nin. But now Vespasian went about other work by the by, during this siege,\nand that was to subdue those that had seized upon Mount Tabor, a place\nthat lies in the middle between the great plain and Scythopolis, whose\ntop is elevated as high as thirty furlongs \nand is hardly to be ascended on its north side; its top is a plain of twenty-six\nfurlongs, and all encompassed with a wall. Now Josephus erected this so\nlong a wall in forty days' time, and furnished it with other materials,\nand with water from below, for the inhabitants only made use of rain water.\nAs therefore there was a great multitude of people gotten together upon\nthis mountain, Vespasian sent Placidus with six hundred horsemen thither.\nNow, as it was impossible for him to ascend the mountain, he invited many\nof them to peace, by the offer of his right hand for their security, and\nof his intercession for them. Accordingly they came down, but with a treacherous\ndesign, as well as he had the like treacherous design upon them on the\nother side; for Placidus spoke mildly to them, as aiming to take them,\nwhen he got them into the plain; they also came down, as complying with\nhis proposals, but it was in order to fall upon him when he was not aware\nof it: however, Placidus's stratagem was too hard for theirs; for when\nthe Jews began to fight, he pretended to run away, and when they were in\npursuit of the Romans, he enticed them a great way along the plain, and\nthen made his horsemen turn back; whereupon he beat them, and slew a great\nnumber of them, and cut off the retreat of the rest of the multitude, and\nhindered their return. So they left Tabor, and fled to Jerusalem, while\nthe people of the country came to terms with him, for their water failed\nthem, and so they delivered up the mountain and themselves to Placidus."}, "But of the people of Gamala, those that were of the bolder sort fled\naway and hid themselves, while the more infirm perished by famine; but\nthe men of war sustained the siege till the two and twentieth day of the\nmonth Hyperberetmus, [Tisri,] when three soldiers of the fifteenth legion,\nabout the morning watch, got under a high tower that was near them, and\nundermined it, without making any noise; nor when they either came to it,\nwhich was in the night time, nor when they were under it, did those that\nguarded it perceive them. These soldiers then upon their coming avoided\nmaking a noise, and when they had rolled away five of its strongest stones,\nthey went away hastily; whereupon the tower fell down on a sudden, with\na very great noise, and its guard fell headlong with it; so that those\nthat kept guard at other places were under such disturbance, that they\nran away; the Romans also slew many of those that ventured to oppose them,\namong whom was Joseph, who was slain by a dart, as he was running away\nover that part of the wall that was broken down: but as those that were\nin the city were greatly aftrighted at the noise, they ran hither and thither,\nand a great consternation fell upon them, as though all the enemy had fallen\nin at once upon them. Then it was that Chares, who was ill, and under the\nphysician's hands, gave up the ghost, the fear he was in greatly contributing\nto make his distemper fatal to him. But the Romans so well remembered their\nformer ill success, that they did not enter the city till the three and\ntwentieth day of the forementioned month.", "At which time Titus, who was now returned, out of the indignation\nhe had at the destruction the Romans had undergone while he was absent,\ntook two hundred chosen horsemen and some footmen with him, and entered\nwithout noise into the city. Now as the watch perceived that he was coming,\nthey made a noise, and betook themselves to their arms; and as that his\nentrance was presently known to those that were in the city, some of them\ncaught hold of their children and their wives, and drew them after them,\nand fled away to the citadel, with lamentations and cries, while others\nof them went to meet Titus, and were killed perpetually; but so many of\nthem as were hindered from running up to the citadel, not knowing what\nin the world to do, fell among the Roman guards, while the groans of those\nthat were killed were prodigiously great every where, and blood ran down\nover all the lower parts of the city, from the upper. But then Vespasian\nhimself came to his assistance against those that had fled to the citadel,\nand brought his whole army with him; now this upper part of the city was\nevery way rocky, and difficult of ascent, and elevated to a vast altitude,\nand very full of people on all sides, and encompassed with precipices,\nwhereby the Jews cut off those that came up to them, and did much mischief\nto others by their darts, and the large stones which they rolled down upon\nthem, while they were themselves so high that the enemy's darts could hardly\nreach them. However, there arose such a Divine storm against them as was\ninstrumental to their destruction; this carried the Roman darts upon them,\nand made those which they threw return back, and drove them obliquely away\nfrom them; nor could the Jews indeed stand upon their precipices, by reason\nof the violence of the wind, having nothing that was stable to stand upon,\nnor could they see those that were ascending up to them; so the Romans\ngot up and surrounded them, and some they slew before they could defend\nthemselves, and others as they were delivering up themselves; and the remembrance\nof those that were slain at their former entrance into the city increased\ntheir rage against them now; a great number also of those that were surrounded\non every side, and despaired of escaping, threw their children and their\nwives, and themselves also, down the precipices, into the valley beneath,\nwhich, near the citadel, had been dug hollow to a vast depth; but so it\nhappened, that the anger of the Romans appeared not to be so extravagant\nas was the madness of those that were now taken, while the Romans slew\nbut four thousand, whereas the number of those that had thrown themselves\ndown was found to be five thousand: nor did any one escape except two women,\nwho were the daughters of Philip, and Philip himself was the son of a certain\neminent man called Jacimus, who had been general of king Agrippa's army;\nand these did therefore escape, because they lay concealed from the rage\nof the Romans when the city was taken; for otherwise they spared not so\nmuch as the infants, of which many were flung down by them from the citadel.\nAnd thus was Gamala taken on the three and twentieth day of the month Hyperberetens,\n[Tisri,] whereas the city had first revolted on the four and twentieth\nday of the month Gorpieus [Elul].", "NOW no place of Galilee remained to be taken but the small city of\nGischala, whose multitude yet were desirous of peace; for they were generally\nhusbandmen, and always applied themselves to cultivate the fruits of the\nearth. However, there were a great number that belonged to a band of robbers,\nthat were already corrupted, and had crept in among them, and some of the\ngoverning part of the citizens were sick of the same distemper. It was\nJohn, the son of a certain man whose name was Levi, that drew them into\nthis rebellion, and encouraged them in it. He was a cunning knave, and\nof a temper that could put on various shapes; very rash in expecting great\nthings, and very sagacious in bringing about what he hoped for. It was\nknown to every body that he was fond of war, in order to thrust himself\ninto authority; and the seditious part of the people of Gischala were under\nhis management, by whose means the populace, who seemed ready to send ambassadors\nin order to a surrender, waited for the coming of the Romans in battle-array.\nVespasian sent against them Titus, with a thousand horsemen, but withdrew\nthe tenth legion to Scythopolis, while he returned to Cesarea with the\ntwo other legions, that he might allow them to refresh themselves after\ntheir long and hard campaign, thinking withal that the plenty which was\nin those cities would improve their bodies and their spirits, against the\ndifficulties they were to go through afterwards; for he saw there would\nbe occasion for great pains about Jerusalem, which was not yet taken, because\nit was the royal city, and the principal city of the whole nation, and\nbecause those that had run away from the war in other places got all together\nthither. It was also naturally strong, and the walls that were built round\nit made him not a little concerned about it. Moreover, he esteemed the\nmen that were in it to be so courageous and bold, that even without the\nconsideration of the walls, it would be hard to subdue them; for which\nreason he took care of and exercised his soldiers beforehand for the work,\nas they do wrestlers before they begin their undertaking.", "Now Titus, as he rode ut to Gischala, found it would be easy for\nhim to take the city upon the first onset; but knew withal, that if he\ntook it by force, the multitude would be destroyed by the soldiers without\nmercy. (Now he was already satiated with the shedding of blood, and pitied\nthe major part, who would then perish, without distinction, together with\nthe guilty.) So he was rather desirous the city might be surrendered up\nto him on terms. Accordingly, when he saw the wall full of those men that\nwere of the corrupted party, he said to them, - That he could not but wonder\nwhat it was they depended on, when they alone staid to fight the Romans,\nafter every other city was taken by them, especially when they have seen\ncities much better fortified than theirs is overthrown by a single attack\nupon them; while as many as have intrusted themselves to the security of\nthe Romans' right hands, which he now offers to them, without regarding\ntheir former insolence, do enjoy their own possessions in safety; for that\nwhile they had hopes of recovering their liberty, they might be pardoned;\nbut that their continuance still in their opposition, when they saw that\nto be impossible, was inexcusable; for that if they will not comply with\nsuch humane offers, and right hands for security, they should have experience\nof such a war as would spare nobody, and should soon be made sensible that\ntheir wall would be but a trifle, when battered by the Roman machines;\nin depending on which they demonstrate themselves to be the only Galileans\nthat were no better than arrogant slaves and captives.", "Now none of the populace durst not only make a reply, but durst not\nso much as get upon the wall, for it was all taken up by the robbers, who\nwere also the guard at the gates, in order to prevent any of the rest from\ngoing out, in order to propose terms of submission, and from receiving\nany of the horsemen into the city. But John returned Titus this answer:\nThat for himself he was content to hearken to his proposals, and that he\nwould either persuade or force those that refused them. Yet he said that\nTitus ought to have such regard to the Jewish law, as to grant them leave\nto celebrate that day, which was the seventh day of the week, on which\nit was unlawful not only to remove their arms, but even to treat of peace\nalso; and that even the Romans were not ignorant how the period of the\nseventh day was among them a cessation from all labors; and that he who\nshould compel them to transgress the law about that day would be equally\nguilty with those that were compelled to transgress it: and that this delay\ncould be of no disadvantage to him; for why should any body think of doing\nany thing in the night, unless it was to fly away? which he might prevent\nby placing his camp round about them; and that they should think it a great\npoint gained, if they might not be obliged to transgress the laws of their\ncountry; and that it would be a right thing for him, who designed to grant\nthem peace, without their expectation of such a favor, to preserve the\nlaws of those they saved inviolable. Thus did this man put a trick upon\nTitus, not so much out of regard to the seventh day as to his own preservation,\nfor he was afraid lest he should be quite deserted if the city should be\ntaken, and had his hopes of life in that night, and in his flight therein.\nNow this was the work of God, who therefore preserved this John, that he\nmight bring on the destruction of Jerusalem; as also it was his work that\nTitus was prevailed with by this pretense for a delay, and that he pitched\nhis camp further off the city at Cydessa. This Cydessa was a strong Mediterranean\nvillage of the Tyrians, which always hated and made war against the Jews;\nit had also a great number of inhabitants, and was well fortified, which\nmade it a proper place for such as were enemies to the Jewish nation.", "Now, in the night time, when John saw that there was no Roman guard\nabout the city, he seized the opportunity directly, and, taking with him\nnot only the armed men that where about him, but a considerable number\nof those that had little to do, together with their families, he fled to\nJerusalem. And indeed, though the man was making haste to get away, and\nwas tormented with fears of being a captive, or of losing his life, yet\ndid he prevail with himself to take out of the city along with him a multitude\nof women and children, as far as twenty furlongs; but there he left them\nas he proceeded further on his journey, where those that were left behind\nmade sad lamentations; for the farther every one of them was come from\nhis own people, the nearer they thought themselves to be to their enemies.\nThey also affrighted themselves with this thought, that those who would\ncarry them into captivity were just at hand, and still turned themselves\nback at the mere noise they made themselves in this their hasty flight,\nas if those from whom they fled were just upon them. Many also of them\nmissed their ways, and the earnestness of such as aimed to outgo the rest\nthrew down many of them. And indeed there was a miserable destruction made\nof the women and children; while some of them took courage to call their\nhusbands and kinsmen back, and to beseech them, with the bitterest lamentations,\nto stay for them; but John's exhortation, who cried out to them to save\nthemselves, and fly away, prevailed. He said also, that if the Romans should\nseize upon those whom they left behind, they would be revenged on them\nfor it. So this multitude that run thus away was dispersed abroad, according\nas each of them was able to run, one faster or slower than another.", "Now on the next day Titus came to the wall, to make the agreement;\nwhereupon the people opened their gates to him, and came out to him, with\ntheir children and wives, and made acclamations of joy to him, as to one\nthat had been their benefactor, and had delivered the city out of custody;\nthey also informed him of John's flight, and besought him to spare them,\nand to come in, and bring the rest of those that were for innovations to\npunishment. But Titus, not so much regarding the supplications of the people,\nsent part of his horsemen to pursue after John, but they could not overtake\nhim, for he was gotten to Jerusalem before; they also slew six thousand\nof the women and children who went out with him, but returned back, and\nbrought with them almost three thousand. However, Titus was greatly displeased\nthat he had not been able to bring this John, who had deluded him, to punishment;\nyet he had captives enough, as well as the corrupted part of the city,\nto satisfy his anger, when it missed of John. So he entered the city in\nthe midst of acclamations of joy; and when he had given orders to the soldiers\nto pull down a small part of the wall, as of a city taken in war, he repressed\nthose that had disturbed the city rather by threatenings than by executions;\nfor he thought that many would accuse innocent persons, out of their own\nprivate animosities and quarrels, if he should attempt to distinguish those\nthat were worthy of punishment from the rest; and that it was better to\nlet a guilty person alone in his fears, that to destroy with him any one\nthat did not deserve it; for that probably such a one might be taught prudence,\nby the fear of the punishment he had deserved, and have a shame upon him\nfor his former offenses, when he had been forgiven; but that the punishment\nof such as have been once put to death could never be retrieved. However,\nhe placed a garrison in the city for its security, by which means he should\nrestrain those that were for innovations, and should leave those that were\npeaceably disposed in greater security. And thus was all Galilee taken,\nbut this not till after it had cost the Romans much pains before it could\nbe taken by them.", "NOW upon John's entry into Jerusalem, the whole body of the people\nwere in an uproar, and ten thousand of them crowded about every one of\nthe fugitives that were come to them, and inquired of them what miseries\nhad happened abroad, when their breath was so short, and hot, and quick,\nthat of itself it declared the great distress they were in; yet did they\ntalk big under their misfortunes, and pretended to say that they had not\nfled away from the Romans, but came thither in order to fight them with\nless hazard; for that it would be an unreasonable and a fruitless thing\nfor them to expose themselves to desperate hazards about Gischala, and\nsuch weak cities, whereas they ought to lay up their weapons and their\nzeal, and reserve it for their metropolis. But when they related to them\nthe taking of Gischala, and their decent departure, as they pretended,\nfrom that place, many of the people understood it to be no better than\na flight; and especially when the people were told of those that were made\ncaptives, they were in great confusion, and guessed those things to be\nplain indications that they should be taken also. But for John, he was\nvery little concerned for those whom he had left behind him, but went about\namong all the people, and persuaded them to go to war, by the hopes he\ngave them. He affirmed that the affairs of the Romans were in a weak condition,\nand extolled his own power. He also jested upon the ignorance of the unskillful,\nas if those Romans, although they should take to themselves wings, could\nnever fly over the wall of Jerusalem, who found such great difficulties\nin taking the villages of Galilee, and had broken their engines of war\nagainst their walls.", "These harangues of John's corrupted a great part of the young men,\nand puffed them up for the war; but as to the more prudent part, and those\nin years, there was not a man of them but foresaw what was coming, and\nmade lamentation on that account, as if the city was already undone; and\nin this confusion were the people. But then it must be observed, that the\nmultitude that came out of the country were at discord before the Jerusalem\nsedition began; for Titus went from Gischala to Cesates, and Vespasian\nfrom Cesarea to Jamnia and Azotus, and took them both; and when he had\nput garrisons into them, he came back with a great number of the people,\nwho were come over to him, upon his giving them his right hand for their\npreservation. There were besides disorders and civil wars in every city;\nand all those that were at quiet from the Romans turned their hands one\nagainst another. There was also a bitter contest between those that were\nfond of war, and those that were desirous for peace. At the first this\nquarrelsome temper caught hold of private families, who could not agree\namong themselves; after which those people that were the dearest to one\nanother brake through all restraints with regard to each other, and every\none associated with those of his own opinion, and began already to stand\nin opposition one to another; so that seditions arose every where, while\nthose that were for innovations, and were desirous of war, by their youth\nand boldness, were too hard for the aged and prudent men. And, in the first\nplace, all the people of every place betook themselves to rapine; after\nwhich they got together in bodies, in order to rob the people of the country,\ninsomuch that for barbarity and iniquity those of the same nation did no\nway differ from the Romans; nay, it seemed to be a much lighter thing to\nbe ruined by the Romans than by themselves.", "Now the Roman garrisons, which guarded the cities, partly out of\ntheir uneasiness to take such trouble upon them, and partly out of the\nhatred they bare to the Jewish nation, did little or nothing towards relieving\nthe miserable, till the captains of these troops of robbers, being satiated\nwith rapines in the country, got all together from all parts, and became\na band of wickedness, and all together crept into Jerusalem, which was\nnow become a city without a governor, and, as the ancient custom was, received\nwithout distinction all that belonged to their nation; and these they then\nreceived, because all men supposed that those who came so fast into the\ncity came out of kindness, and for their assistance, although these very\nmen, besides the seditions they raised, were otherwise the direct cause\nof the city's destruction also; for as they were an unprofitable and a\nuseless multitude, they spent those provisions beforehand which might otherwise\nhave been sufficient for the fighting men. Moreover, besides the bringing\non of the war, they were the occasions of sedition and famine therein.", "There were besides these other robbers that came out of the country,\nand came into the city, and joining to them those that were worse than\nthemselves, omitted no kind of barbarity; for they did not measure their\ncourage by their rapines and plunderings only, but preceded as far as murdering\nmen; and this not in the night time or privately, or with regard to ordinary\nmen, but did it openly in the day time, and began with the most eminent\npersons in the city; for the first man they meddled with was Antipas, one\nof the royal lineage, and the most potent man in the whole city, insomuch\nthat the public treasures were committed to his care; him they took and\nconfined; as they did in the next place to Levias, a person of great note,\nwith Sophas, the son of Raguel, both which were of royal lineage also.\nAnd besides these, they did the same to the principal men of the country.\nThis caused a terrible consternation among the people, and everyone contented\nhimself with taking care of his own safety, as they would do if the city\nhad been taken in war.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This\nname Dorcas in Greek, was Tabitha in Hebrew or Syriac, as Acts 9:36.

These men made the\ntemple of God a strong hold for them, and a place whither they might resort,\nin order to avoid the troubles they feared from the people; the sanctuary\nwas now become a refuge, and a shop of tyranny. They also mixed jesting\namong the miseries they introduced, which was more intolerable than what\nthey did; for in order to try what surprise the people would be under,\nand how far their own power extended, they undertook to dispose of the\nhigh priesthood by casting lots for it, whereas, as we have said already,\nit was to descend by succession in a family. The pretense they made for\nthis strange attempt was an ancient practice, while they said that of old\nit was determined by lot; but in truth, it was no better than a dissolution\nof an undeniable law, and a cunning contrivance to seize upon the government,\nderived from those that presumed to appoint governors as they themselves\npleased.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This\ntribe or course of the high priests, or priests, here called Eniachim,\nseems to the learned Mr. Lowth, one well versed in Josephus, to be that\n1 Chronicles 24:12, \"the course of Jakim,\" where some copies\nhave\" the course of Eliakim;\" and I think this to be by no means\nan improbable conjecture."}, "#text": "Hereupon they sent for one of the pontifical tribes, which is called\nEniachim, \nand cast lots which of it should be the high priest.

He was a man not only unworthy of the high priesthood, but that\ndid not well know what the high priesthood was, such a mere rustic was\nhe ! yet did they hail this man, without his own consent, out of the country,\nas if they were acting a play upon the stage, and adorned him with a counterfeit\nthee; they also put upon him the sacred garments, and upon every occasion\ninstructed him what he was to do. This horrid piece of wickedness was sport\nand pastime with them, but occasioned the other priests, who at a distance\nsaw their law made a jest of, to shed tears, and sorely lament the dissolution\nof such a sacred dignity."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This\nSymeon, the son of Gamaliel, is mentioned as the president of the Jewish\nsanhedrim, and one that perished in the destruction of Jerusalem, by the\nJewish Rabbins, as Reland observes on this place.

The best esteemed also of the\nhigh priests, Jesus the son of Gamalas, and Ananus the son of Ananus when\nthey were at their assemblies, bitterly reproached the people for their\nsloth, and excited them against the zealots; for that was the name they\nwent by, as if they were zealous in good undertakings, and were not rather\nzealous in the worst actions, and extravagant in them beyond the example\nof others."}, "And now, when the multitude were gotten together to an assembly,\nand every one was in indignation at these men's seizing upon the sanctuary,\nat their rapine and murders, but had not yet begun their attacks upon them,\n(the reason of which was this, that they imagined it to be a difficult\nthing to suppress these zealots, as indeed the case was,) Ananus stood\nin the midst of them, and casting his eyes frequently at the temple, and\nhaving a flood of tears in his eyes, he said, \"Certainly it had been\ngood for me to die before I had seen the house of God full of so many abominations,\nor these sacred places, that ought not to be trodden upon at random, filled\nwith the feet of these blood-shedding villains; yet do I, who am clothed\nwith the vestments of the high priesthood, and am called by that most venerable\nname [of high priest], still live, and am but too fond of living, and cannot\nendure to undergo a death which would be the glory of my old age; and if\nI were the only person concerned, and as it were in a desert, I would give\nup my life, and that alone for God's sake; for to what purpose is it to\nlive among a people insensible of their calamities, and where there is\nno notion remaining of any remedy for the miseries that are upon them?\nfor when you are seized upon, you bear it! and when you are beaten, you\nare silent! and when the people are murdered, nobody dare so much as send\nout a groan openly! O bitter tyranny that we are under! But why do I complain\nof the tyrants? Was it not you, and your sufferance of them, that have\nnourished them? Was it not you that overlooked those that first of all\ngot together, for they were then but a few, and by your silence made them\ngrow to be many; and by conniving at them when they took arms, in effect\narmed them against yourselves? You ought to have then prevented their first\nattempts, when they fell a reproaching your relations; but by neglecting\nthat care in time, you have encouraged these wretches to plunder men. When\nhouses were pillaged, nobody said a word, which was the occasion why they\ncarried off the owners of those houses; and when they were drawn through\nthe midst of the city, nobody came to their assistance. They then proceeded\nto put those whom you have betrayed into their hands into bonds. I do not\nsay how many and of what characters those men were whom they thus served;\nbut certainly they were such as were accused by none, and condemned by\nnone; and since nobody succored them when they were put into bonds, the\nconsequence was, that you saw the same persons slain. We have seen this\nalso; so that still the best of the herd of brute animals, as it were,\nhave been still led to be sacrificed, when yet nobody said one word, or\nmoved his right hand for their preservation. Will you bear, therefore,\nwill you bear to see your sanctuary trampled on? and will you lay steps\nfor these profane wretches, upon which they may mount to higher degrees\nof insolence? Will not you pluck them down from their exaltation? for even\nby this time they had proceeded to higher enormities, if they had been\nable to overthrow any thing greater than the sanctuary. They have seized\nupon the strongest place of the whole city; you may call it the temple,\nif you please, though it be like a citadel or fortress. Now, while you\nhave tyranny in so great a degree walled in, and see your enemies over\nyour heads, to what purpose is it to take counsel? and what have you to\nsupport your minds withal? Perhaps you wait for the Romans, that they may\nprotect our holy places: are our matters then brought to that pass? and\nare we come to that degree of misery, that our enemies themselves are expected\nto pity us? O wretched creatures! will not you rise up and turn upon those\nthat strike you? which you may observe in wild beasts themselves, that\nthey will avenge themselves on those that strike them. Will you not call\nto mind, every one of you, the calamities you yourselves have suffered?\nnor lay before your eyes what afflictions you yourselves have undergone?\nand will not such things sharpen your souls to revenge? Is therefore that\nmost honorable and most natural of our passions utterly lost, I mean the\ndesire of liberty? Truly we are in love with slavery, and in love with\nthose that lord it over us, as if we had received that principle of subjection\nfrom our ancestors; yet did they undergo many and great wars for the sake\nof liberty, nor were they so far overcome by the power of the Egyptians,\nor the Medes, but that still they did what they thought fit, notwithstanding\ntheir commands to the contrary. And what occasion is there now for a war\nwith the Romans? (I meddle not with determining whether it be an advantageous\nand profitable war or not.) What pretense is there for it? Is it not that\nwe may enjoy our liberty? Besides, shall we not bear the lords of the habitable\nearth to be lords over us, and yet bear tyrants of our own country? Although\nI must say that submission to foreigners may be borne, because fortune\nhath already doomed us to it, while submission to wicked people of our\nown nation is too unmanly, and brought upon us by our own consent. However,\nsince I have had occasion to mention the Romans, I will not conceal a thing\nthat, as I am speaking, comes into my mind, and affects me considerably;\nit is this, that though we should be taken by them, (God forbid the event\nshould be so!) yet can we undergo nothing that will be harder to be borne\nthan what these men have already brought upon us. How then can we avoid\nshedding of tears, when we see the Roman donations in our temple, while\nwe withal see those of our own nation taking our spoils, and plundering\nour glorious metropolis, and slaughtering our men, from which enormities\nthose Romans themselves would have abstained? to see those Romans never\ngoing beyond the bounds allotted to profane persons, nor venturing to break\nin upon any of our sacred customs; nay, having a horror on their minds\nwhen they view at a distance those sacred walls; while some that have been\nborn in this very country, and brought up in our customs, and called Jews,\ndo walk about in the midst of the holy places, at the very time when their\nhands are still warm with the slaughter of their own countrymen. Besides,\ncan any one be afraid of a war abroad, and that with such as will have\ncomparatively much greater moderation than our own people have? For truly,\nif we may suit our words to the things they represent, it is probable one\nmay hereafter find the Romans to be the supporters of our laws, and those\nwithin ourselves the subverters of them. And now I am persuaded that every\none of you here comes satisfied before I speak that these overthrowers\nof our liberties deserve to be destroyed, and that nobody can so much as\ndevise a punishment that they have not deserved by what they have done,\nand that you are all provoked against them by those their wicked actions,\nwhence you have suffered so greatly. But perhaps many of you are aftrighted\nat the multitude of those zealots, and at their audaciousness, as well\nas at the advantage they have over us in their being higher in place than\nwe are; for these circumstances, as they have been occasioned by your negligence,\nso will they become still greater by being still longer neglected; for\ntheir multitude is every day augmented, by every ill man's running away\nto those that are like to themselves, and their audaciousness is therefore\ninflamed, because they meet with no obstruction to their designs. And for\ntheir higher place, they will make use of it for engines also, if we give\nthem time to do so; but be assured of this, that if we go up to fight them,\nthey will be made tamer by their own consciences, and what advantages they\nhave in the height of their situation they will lose by the opposition\nof their reason; perhaps also God himself, who hath been affronted by them,\nwill make what they throw at us return against themselves, and these impious\nwretches will be killed by their own darts: let us but make our appearance\nbefore them, and they will come to nothing. However, it is a right thing,\nif there should be any danger in the attempt, to die before these holy\ngates, and to spend our very lives, if not for the sake of our children\nand wives, yet for God's sake, and for the sake of his sanctuary. I will\nassist you both with my counsel and with my hand; nor shall any sagacity\nof ours be wanting for your support; nor shall you see that I will be sparing\nof my body neither.\"", "By these motives Ananus encouraged the multitude to go against the\nzealots, although he knew how difficult it would be to disperse them, because\nof their multitude, and their youth, and the courage of their souls; but\nchiefly because of their consciousness of what they had done, since they\nwould not yield, as not so much as hoping for pardon at the last for those\ntheir enormities. However, Ananus resolved to undergo whatever sufferings\nmight come upon him, rather than overlook things, now they were in such\ngreat confusion. So the multitude cried out to him, to lead them on against\nthose whom he had described in his exhortation to them, and every one of\nthem was most readily disposed to run any hazard whatsoever on that account.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "It\nis worth noting here, that this Ananus, the best of the Jews at this time,\nand the high priest, who was so very uneasy at the profanation of the Jewish\ncourts of the temple by the zealots, did not however scruple the profanation\nof the \"court of the Gentiles;\" as in our Savior's days it was\nvery much profaned by the Jews; and made a market-place, nay, a \"den\nof thieves,\" without scruple, Matthew 21:12, 13; Mark 11:15-17. Accordingly\nJosephus himself, when he speaks of the two inner courts, calls them both\nhagia or holy places; but, so far as I remember, never gives that character\nof the court of the Gentiles. See B. V. ch. 9. sect. 2."}, "#text": "Now while Ananus was choosing out his men, and putting those that\nwere proper for his purpose in array for fighting, the zealots got information\nof his undertaking, (for there were some who went to them, and told them\nall that the people were doing,) and were irritated at it, and leaping\nout of the temple in crowds, and by parties, spared none whom they met\nwith. Upon this Ananus got the populace together on the sudden, who were\nmore numerous indeed than the zealots, but inferior to them in arms, because\nthey had not been regularly put into array for fighting; but the alacrity\nthat every body showed supplied all their defects on both sides, the citizens\ntaking up so great a passion as was stronger than arms, and deriving a\ndegree of courage from the temple more forcible than any multitude whatsoever;\nand indeed these citizens thought it was not possible for them to dwell\nin the city, unless they could cut off the robbers that were in it. The\nzealots also thought that unless they prevailed, there would be no punishment\nso bad but it would be inflicted on them. So their conflicts were conducted\nby their passions; and at the first they only cast stones at each other\nin the city, and before the temple, and threw their javelins at a distance;\nbut when either of them were too hard for the other, they made use of their\nswords; and great slaughter was made on both sides, and a great number\nwere wounded. As for the dead bodies of the people, their relations carried\nthem out to their own houses; but when any of the zealots were wounded,\nhe went up into the temple, and defiled that sacred floor with his blood,\ninsomuch that one may say it was their blood alone that polluted our sanctuary.\nNow in these conflicts the robbers always sallied out of the temple, and\nwere too hard for their enemies; but the populace grew very angry, and\nbecame more and more numerous, and reproached those that gave back, and\nthose behind would not afford room to those that were going off, but forced\nthem on again, till at length they made their whole body to turn against\ntheir adversaries, and the robbers could no longer oppose them, but were\nforced gradually to retire into the temple; when Ananus and his party fell\ninto it at the same time together with them. \nThis horribly affrighted the robbers, because it deprived them of the first\ncourt; so they fled into the inner court immediately, and shut the gates.\nNow Ananus did not think fit to make any attack against the holy gates,\nalthough the other threw their stones and darts at them from above. He\nalso deemed it unlawful to introduce the multitude into that court before\nthey were purified; he therefore chose out of them all by lot six thousand\narmed men, and placed them as guards in the cloisters; so there was a succession\nof such guards one after another, and every one was forced to attend in\nhis course; although many of the chief of the city were dismissed by those\nthat then took on them the government, upon their hiring some of the poorer\nsort, and sending them to keep the guard in their stead."}, "Now it was John who, as we told you, ran away from Gischala, and\nwas the occasion of all these being destroyed. He was a man of great craft,\nand bore about him in his soul a strong passion after tyranny, and at a\ndistance was the adviser in these actions; and indeed at this time he pretended\nto be of the people's opinion, and went all about with Ananus when he consulted\nthe great men every day, and in the night time also when he went round\nthe watch; but he divulged their secrets to the zealots, and every thing\nthat the people deliberated about was by his means known to their enemies,\neven before it had been well agreed upon by themselves. And by way of contrivance\nhow he might not be brought into suspicion, he cultivated the greatest\nfriendship possible with Ananus, and with the chief of the people; yet\ndid this overdoing of his turn against him, for he flattered them so extravagantly,\nthat he was but the more suspected; and his constant attendance every where,\neven when he was not invited to be present, made him strongly suspected\nof betraying their secrets to the enemy; for they plainly perceived that\nthey understood all the resolutions taken against them at their consultations.\nNor was there any one whom they had so much reason to suspect of that discovery\nas this John; yet was it not easy to get quit of him, so potent was he\ngrown by his wicked practices. He was also supported by many of those eminent\nmen, who were to be consulted upon all considerable affairs; it was therefore\nthought reasonable to oblige him to give them assurance of his good-will\nupon oath; accordingly John took such an oath readily, that he would be\non the people's side, and would not betray any of their counsels or practices\nto their enemies, and would assist them in overthrowing those that attacked\nthem, and that both by his hand and his advice. So Ananus and his party\nbelieved his oath, and did now receive him to their consultations without\nfurther suspicion; nay, so far did they believe him, that they sent him\nas their ambassador into the temple to the zealots, with proposals of accommodation;\nfor they were very desirous to avoid the pollution of the temple as much\nas they possibly could, and that no one of their nation should be slain\ntherein.", "But now this John, as if his oath had been made to the zealots,\nand for confirmation of his good-will to them, and not against them, went\ninto the temple, and stood in the midst of them, and spake as follows:\nThat he had run many hazards o, their accounts, and in order to let them\nknow of every thing that was secretly contrived against them by Ananus\nand his party; but that both he and they should be cast into the most imminent\ndanger, unless some providential assistance were afforded them; for that\nAnanus made no longer delay, but had prevailed with the people to send\nambassadors to Vespasian, to invite him to come presently and take the\ncity; and that he had appointed a fast for the next day against them, that\nthey might obtain admission into the temple on a religious account, or\ngain it by force, and fight with them there; that he did not see how long\nthey could either endure a siege, or how they could fight against so many\nenemies. He added further, that it was by the providence of God he was\nhimself sent as an ambassador to them for an accommodation; for that Artanus\ndid therefore offer them such proposals, that he might come upon them when\nthey were unarmed; that they ought to choose one of these two methods,\neither to intercede with those that guarded them, to save their lives,\nor to provide some foreign assistance for themselves; that if they fostered\nthemselves with the hopes of pardon, in case they were subdued, they had\nforgotten what desperate things they had done, or could suppose, that as\nsoon as the actors repented, those that had suffered by them must be presently\nreconciled to them; while those that have done injuries, though they pretend\nto repent of them, are frequently hated by the others for that sort of\nrepentance; and that the sufferers, when they get the power into their\nhands, are usually still more severe upon the actors; that the friends\nand kindred of those that had been destroyed would always be laying plots\nagainst them; and that a large body of people were very angry on account\nof their gross breaches of their laws, and [illegal] judicatures, insomuch\nthat although some part might commiserate them, those would be quite overborne\nby the majority.", "NOW, by this crafty speech, John made the zealots afraid; yet durst\nhe not directly name what foreign assistance he meant, but in a covert\nway only intimated at the Idumeans. But now, that he might particularly\nirritate the leaders of the zealots, he calumniated Ananus, that he was\nabout a piece of barbarity, and did in a special manner threaten them.\nThese leaders were Eleazar, the son of Simon, who seemed the most plausible\nman of them all, both in considering what was fit to be done, and in the\nexecution of what he had determined upon, and Zacharias, the son of Phalek;\nboth of whom derived their families from the priests. Now when these two\nmen had heard, not only the common threatenings which belonged to them\nall, but those peculiarly leveled against themselves; and besides, how\nArtanus and his party, in order to secure their own dominion, had invited\nthe Romans to come to them, for that also was part of John's lie; they\nhesitated a great while what they should do, considering the shortness\nof the time by which they were straitened; because the people were prepared\nto attack them very soon, and because the suddenness of the plot laid against\nthem had almost cut off all their hopes of getting any foreign assistance;\nfor they might be under the height of their afflictions before any of their\nconfederates could be informed of it. However, it was resolved to call\nin the Idumeans; so they wrote a short letter to this effect: That Ananus\nhad imposed on the people, and was betraying their metropolis to the Romans;\nthat they themselves had revolted from the rest, and were in custody in\nthe temple, on account of the preservation of their liberty; that there\nwas but a small time left wherein they might hope for their deliverance;\nand that unless they would come immediately to their assistance, they should\nthemselves be soon in the power of Artanus, and the city would be in the\npower of the Romans. They also charged the messengers to tell many more\ncircumstances to the rulers of the Idumeans. Now there were two active\nmen proposed for the carrying this message, and such as were able to speak,\nand to persuade them that things were in this posture, and, what was a\nqualification still more necessary than the former, they were very swift\nof foot; for they knew well enough that these would immediately comply\nwith their desires, as being ever a tumultuous and disorderly nation, always\non the watch upon every motion, delighting in mutations; and upon your\nflattering them ever so little, and petitioning them, they soon take their\narms, and put themselves into motion, and make haste to a battle, as if\nit were to a feast. There was indeed occasion for quick despatch in the\ncarrying of this message, in which point the messengers were no way defective.\nBoth their names were Ananias; and they soon came to the rulers of the\nIdumeans.", "Now these rulers were greatly surprised at the contents of the letter,\nand at what those that came with it further told them; whereupon they ran\nabout the nation like madmen, and made proclamation that the people should\ncome to war; so a multitude was suddenly got together, sooner indeed than\nthe time appointed in the proclamation, and every body caught up their\narms, in order to maintain the liberty of their metropolis; and twenty\nthousand of them were put into battle-array, and came to Jerusalem, under\nfour commanders, John, and Jacob the son of Sosas; and besides these were\nSimon, the son of Cathlas, and Phineas, the son of Clusothus.", "Now this exit of the messengers was not known either to Ananus or\nto the guards, but the approach of the Idumeans was known to him; for as\nhe knew of it before they came, he ordered the gates to be shut against\nthem, and that the walls should be guarded. Yet did not he by any means\nthink of fighting against them, but, before they came to blows, to try\nwhat persuasions would do. Accordingly, Jesus, the eldest of the high priests\nnext to Artanus, stood upon the tower that was over against them, and said\nthus: \"Many troubles indeed, and those of various kinds, have fallen\nupon this city, yet in none of them have I so much wondered at her fortune\nas now, when you are come to assist wicked men, and this after a manner\nvery extraordinary; for I see that you are come to support the vilest of\nmen against us, and this with so great alacrity, as you could hardly put\non the like, in case our metropolis had called you to her assistance against\nbarbarians. And if I had perceived that your army was composed of men like\nunto those who invited them, I had not deemed your attempt so absurd; for\nnothing does so much cement the minds of men together as the alliance there\nis between their manners. But now for these men who have invited you, if\nyou were to examine them one by one, every one of them would be found to\nhave deserved ten thousand deaths; for the very rascality and offscouring\nof the whole country, who have spent in debauchery their own substance,\nand, by way of trial beforehand, have madly plundered the neighboring villages\nand cities, in the upshot of all, have privately run together into this\nholy city. They are robbers, who by their prodigious wickedness have profaned\nthis most sacred floor, and who are to be now seen drinking themselves\ndrunk in the sanctuary, and expending the spoils of those whom they have\nslaughtered upon their unsatiable bellies. As for the multitude that is\nwith you, one may see them so decently adorned in their armor, as it would\nbecome them to be had their metropolis called them to her assistance against\nforeigners. What can a man call this procedure of yours but the sport of\nfortune, when he sees a whole nation coming to protect a sink of wicked\nwretches? I have for a good while been in doubt what it could possibly\nbe that should move you to do this so suddenly; because certainly you would\nnot take on your armor on the behalf of robbers, and against a people of\nkin to you, without some very great cause for your so doing. But we have\nan item that the Romans are pretended, and that we are supposed to be going\nto betray this city to them; for some of your men have lately made a clamor\nabout those matters, and have said they are come to set their metropolis\nfree. Now we cannot but admire at these wretches in their devising such\na lie as this against us; for they knew there was no other way to irritate\nagainst us men that were naturally desirous of liberty, and on that account\nthe best disposed to fight against foreign enemies, but by framing a tale\nas if we were going to betray that most desirable thing, liberty. But you\nought to consider what sort of people they are that raise this calumny,\nand against what sort of people that calumny is raised, and to gather the\ntruth of things, not by fictitious speeches, but out of the actions of\nboth parties; for what occasion is there for us to sell ourselves to the\nRomans, while it was in our power not to have revolted from them at the\nfirst, or when we had once revolted, to have returned under their dominion\nagain, and this while the neighboring countries were not yet laid waste?\nwhereas it is not an easy thing to be reconciled to the Romans, if we were\ndesirous of it, now they have subdued Galilee, and are thereby become proud\nand insolent; and to endeavor to please them at the time when they are\nso near us, would bring such a reproach upon us as were worse than death.\nAs for myself, indeed, I should have preferred peace with them before death;\nbut now we have once made war upon them, and fought with them, I prefer\ndeath, with reputation, before living in captivity under them. But further,\nwhether do they pretend that we, who are the rulers of the people, have\nsent thus privately to the Romans, or hath it been done by the common suffrages\nof the people? If it be ourselves only that have done it, let them name\nthose friends of ours that have been sent, as our servants, to manage this\ntreachery. Hath any one been caught as he went out on this errand, or seized\nupon as he came back? Are they in possession of our letters? How could\nwe be concealed from such a vast number of our fellow citizens, among whom\nwe are conversant every hour, while what is done privately in the country\nis, it seems, known by the zealots, who are but few in number, and under\nconfinement also, and are not able to come out of the temple into the city.\nIs this the first time that they are become sensible how they ought to\nbe punished for their insolent actions? For while these men were free from\nthe fear they are now under, there was no suspicion raised that any of\nus were traitors. But if they lay this charge against the people, this\nmust have been done at a public consultation, and not one of the people\nmust have dissented from the rest of the assembly; in which case the public\nfame of this matter would have come to you sooner than any particular indication.\nBut how could that be? Must there not then have been ambassadors sent to\nconfirm the agreements? And let them tell us who this ambassador was that\nwas ordained for that purpose. But this is no other than a pretense of\nsuch men as are loath to die, and are laboring to escape those punishments\nthat hang over them; for if fate had determined that this city was to be\nbetrayed into its enemies' hands, no other than these men that accuse us\nfalsely could have the impudence to do it, there being no wickedness wanting\nto complete their impudent practices but this only, that they become traitors.\nAnd now you Idumeans are come hither already with your arms, it is your\nduty, in the first place, to be assisting to your metropolis, and to join\nwith us in cutting off those tyrants that have infringed the rules of our\nregular tribunals, that have trampled upon our laws, and made their swords\nthe arbitrators of right and wrong; for they have seized upon men of great\neminence, and under no accusation, as they stood in the midst of the market-place,\nand tortured them with putting them into bonds, and, without bearing to\nhear what they had to say, or what supplications they made, they destroyed\nthem. You may, if you please, come into the city, though not in the way\nof war, and take a view of the marks still remaining of what I now say,\nand may see the houses that have been depopulated by their rapacious hands,\nwith those wives and families that are in black, mourning for their slaughtered\nrelations; as also you may hear their groans and lamentations all the city\nover; for there is nobody but hath tasted of the incursions of these profane\nwretches, who have proceeded to that degree of madness, as not only to\nhave transferred their impudent robberies out of the country, and the remote\ncities, into this city, the very face and head of the whole nation, but\nout of the city into the temple also; for that is now made their receptacle\nand refuge, and the fountain-head whence their preparations are made against\nus. And this place, which is adored by the habitable world, and honored\nby such as only know it by report, as far as the ends of the earth, is\ntrampled upon by these wild beasts born among ourselves. They now triumph\nin the desperate condition they are already in, when they hear that one\npeople is going to fight against another people, and one city against another\ncity, and that your nation hath gotten an army together against its own\nbowels. Instead of which procedure, it were highly fit and reasonable,\nas I said before, for you to join with us in cutting off these wretches,\nand in particular to be revenged on them for putting this very cheat upon\nyou; I mean, for having the impudence to invite you to assist them, of\nwhom they ought to have stood in fear, as ready to punish them. But if\nyou have some regard to these men's invitation of you, yet may you lay\naside your arms, and come into the city under the notion of our kindred,\nand take upon you a middle name between that of auxiliaries and of enemies,\nand so become judges in this case. However, consider what these men will\ngain by being called into judgment before you, for such undeniable and\nsuch flagrant crimes, who would not vouchsafe to hear such as had no accusations\nlaid against them to speak a word for themselves. However, let them gain\nthis advantage by your coming. But still, if you will neither take our\npart in that indignation we have at these men, nor judge between us, the\nthird thing I have to propose is this, that you let us both alone, and\nneither insult upon our calamities, nor abide with these plotters against\ntheir metropolis; for though you should have ever so great a suspicion\nthat some of us have discoursed with the Romans, it is in your power to\nwatch the passages into the city; and in case any thing that we have been\naccused of is brought to light, then to come and defend your metropolis,\nand to inflict punishment on those that are found guilty; for the enemy\ncannot prevent you who are so near to the city. But if, after all, none\nof these proposals seem acceptable and moderate, do not you wonder that\nthe gates are shut against you, while you bear your arms about you.\"", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This\nappellation of Jerusalem given it here by Simon, the general of the Idumeans,\n\"the common city\" of the Idumeans, who were proselytes of justice,\nas well as of the original native Jews, greatly confirms that maxim of\nthe Rabbins, here set down by Reland, that \"Jerusalem was not assigned,\nor appropriated, to the tribe of Benjamin or Judah, but every tribe had\nequal right to it [at their coming to worship there at the several festivals].\"\nSee a little before, ch. 3. sect. 3, or \"worldly worship,\" as\nthe author to the Hebrews calls the sanctuary, \"a worldly sanctuary.\""}, "#text": "Thus spake Jesus; yet did not the multitude of the Idumeans give\nany attention to what he said, but were in a rage, because they did not\nmeet with a ready entrance into the city. The generals also had indignation\nat the offer of laying down their arms, and looked upon it as equal to\na captivity, to throw them away at any man's injunction whomsoever. But\nSimon, the son of Cathlas, one of their commanders, with much ado quieted\nthe tumult of his own men, and stood so that the high priests might hear\nhim, and said as follows: \"I can no longer wonder that the patrons\nof liberty are under custody in the temple, since there are those that\nshut the gates of our common city \nto their own nation, and at the same time are prepared to admit the Romans\ninto it; nay, perhaps are disposed to crown the gates with garlands at\ntheir coming, while they speak to the Idumeans from their own towers, and\nenjoin them to throw down their arms which they have taken up for the preservation\nof its liberty. And while they will not intrust the guard of our metropolis\nto their kindred, profess to make them judges of the differences that are\namong them; nay, while they accuse some men of having slain others without\na legal trial, they do themselves condemn a whole nation after an ignominious\nmanner, and have now walled up that city from their own nation, which used\nto be open to even all foreigners that came to worship there. We have indeed\ncome in great haste to you, and to a war against our own countrymen; and\nthe reason why we have made such haste is this, that we may preserve that\nfreedom which you are so unhappy as to betray. You have probably been guilty\nof the like crimes against those whom you keep in custody, and have, I\nsuppose, collected together the like plausible pretenses against them also\nthat you make use of against us; after which you have gotten the mastery\nof those within the temple, and keep them in custody, while they are only\ntaking care of the public affairs. You have also shut the gates of the\ncity in general against nations that are the most nearly related to you;\nand while you give such injurious commands to others, you complain that\nyou have been tyrannized over by them, and fix the name of unjust governors\nupon such as are tyrannized over by yourselves. Who can bear this your\nabuse of words, while they have a regard to the contrariety of your actions,\nunless you mean this, that those Idumeans do now exclude you out of your\nmetropolis, whom you exclude from the sacred offices of your own country?\nOne may indeed justly complain of those that are besieged in the temple,\nthat when they had courage enough to punish those tyrants whom you call\neminent men, and free from any accusations, because of their being your\ncompanions in wickedness, they did not begin with you, and thereby cut\noff beforehand the most dangerous parts of this treason. But if these men\nhave been more merciful than the public necessity required, we that are\nIdumeans will preserve this house of God, and will fight for our common\ncountry, and will oppose by war as well those that attack them from abroad,\nas those that betray them from within. Here will we abide before the walls\nin our armor, until either the Romans grow weary in waiting for you, or\nyou become friends to liberty, and repent of what you have done against\nit.\""}, "And now did the Idumeans make an acclamation to what Simon had said;\nbut Jesus went away sorrowful, as seeing that the Idumeans were against\nall moderate counsels, and that the city was besieged on both sides. Nor\nindeed were the minds of the Idumeans at rest; for they were in a rage\nat the injury that had been offered them by their exclusion out of the\ncity; and when they thought the zealots had been strong, but saw nothing\nof theirs to support them, they were in doubt about the matter, and many\nof them repented that they had come thither. But the shame that would attend\nthem in case they returned without doing any thing at all, so far overcame\nthat their repentance, that they lay all night before the wall, though\nin a very bad encampment; for there broke out a prodigious storm in the\nnight, with the utmost violence, and very strong winds, with the largest\nshowers of rain, with continued lightnings, terrible thunderings, and amazing\nconcussions and bellowings of the earth, that was in an earthquake. These\nthings were a manifest indication that some destruction was coming upon\nmen, when the system of the world was put into this disorder; and any one\nwould guess that these wonders foreshowed some grand calamities that were\ncoming.", "Now the opinion of the Idumeans and of the citizens was one and the\nsame. The Idumeans thought that God was angry at their taking arms, and\nthat they would not escape punishment for their making war upon their metropolis.\nAnanus and his party thought that they had conquered without fighting,\nand that God acted as a general for them; but truly they proved both ill\nconjectures at what was to come, and made those events to be ominous to\ntheir enemies, while they were themselves to undergo the ill effects of\nthem; for the Idumeans fenced one another by uniting their bodies into\none band, and thereby kept themselves warm, and connecting their shields\nover their heads, were not so much hurt by the rain. But the zealots were\nmore deeply concerned for the danger these men were in than they were for\nthemselves, and got together, and looked about them to see whether they\ncould devise any means of assisting them. The hotter sort of them thought\nit best to force their guards with their arms, and after that to fall into\nthe midst of the city, and publicly open the gates to those that came to\ntheir assistance; as supposing the guards would be in disorder, and give\nway at such an unexpected attempt of theirs, especially as the greater\npart of them were unarmed and unskilled in the affairs of war; and that\nbesides the multitude of the citizens would not be easily gathered together,\nbut confined to their houses by the storm: and that if there were any hazard\nin their undertaking, it became them to suffer any thing whatsoever themselves,\nrather than to overlook so great a multitude as were miserably perishing\non their account. But the more prudent part of them disapproved of this\nforcible method, because they saw not only the guards about them very numerous,\nbut the walls of the city itself carefully watched, by reason of the Idumeans.\nThey also supposed that Ananus would be every where, and visit the guards\nevery hour; which indeed was done upon other nights, but was omitted that\nnight, not by reason of any slothfulness of Ananus, but by the overbearing\nappointment of fate, that so both he might himself perish, and the multitude\nof the guards might perish with him; for truly, as the night was far gone,\nand the storm very terrible, Ananus gave the guards in the cloisters leave\nto go to sleep; while it came into the heads of the zealots to make use\nof the saws belonging to the temple, and to cut the bars of the gates to\npieces. The noise of the wind, and that not inferior sound of the thunder,\ndid here also conspire with their designs, that the noise of the saws was\nnot heard by the others.", "So they secretly went out of the temple to the wall of the city,\nand made use of their saws, and opened that gate which was over against\nthe Idumeans. Now at first there came a fear upon the Idumeans themselves,\nwhich disturbed them, as imagining that Ananus and his party were coming\nto attack them, so that every one of them had his right hand upon his sword,\nin order to defend himself; but they soon came to know who they were that\ncame to them, and were entered the city. And had the Idumeans then fallen\nupon the city, nothing could have hindered them from destroying the people\nevery man of them, such was the rage they were in at that time; but as\nthey first of all made haste to get the zealots out of custody, which those\nthat brought them in earnestly desired them to do, and not to overlook\nthose for whose sakes they were come, in the midst of their distresses,\nnor to bring them into a still greater danger; for that when they had once\nseized upon the guards, it would be easy for them to fall upon the city;\nbut that if the city were once alarmed, they would not then be able to\novercome those guards, because as soon as they should perceive they were\nthere, they would put themselves in order to fight them, and would hinder\ntheir coming into the temple.", "THIS advice pleased the Idumeans, and they ascended through the city\nto the temple. The zealots were also in great expectation of their coming,\nand earnestly waited for them. When therefore these were entering, they\nalso came boldly out of the inner temple, and mixing themselves among the\nIdumeans, they attacked the guards; and some of those that were upon the\nwatch, but were fallen asleep, they killed as they were asleep; but as\nthose that were now awakened made a cry, the whole multitude arose, and\nin the amazement they were in caught hold of their arms immediately, and\nbetook themselves to their own defense; and so long as they thought they\nwere only the zealots who attacked them, they went on boldly, as hoping\nto overpower them by their numbers; but when they saw others pressing in\nupon them also, they perceived the Idumeans were got in; and the greatest\npart of them laid aside their arms, together with their courage, and betook\nthemselves to lamentations. But some few of the younger sort covered themselves\nwith their armor, and valiantly received the Idumeans, and for a while\nprotected the multitude of old men. Others, indeed, gave a signal to those\nthat were in the city of the calamities they were in; but when these were\nalso made sensible that the Idumeans were come in, none of them durst come\nto their assistance, only they returned the terrible echo of wailing, and\nlamented their misfortunes. A great howling of the women was excited also,\nand every one of the guards were in danger of being killed. The zealots\nalso joined in the shouts raised by the Idumeans; and the storm itself\nrendered the cry more terrible; nor did the Idumeans spare any body; for\nas they are naturally a most barbarous and bloody nation, and had been\ndistressed by the tempest, they made use of their weapons against those\nthat had shut the gates against them, and acted in the same manner as to\nthose that supplicated for their lives, and to those that fought them,\ninsomuch that they ran through those with their swords who desired them\nto remember the relation there was between them, and begged of them to\nhave regard to their common temple. Now there was at present neither any\nplace for flight, nor any hope of preservation; but as they were driven\none upon another in heaps, so were they slain. Thus the greater part were\ndriven together by force, as there was now no place of retirement, and\nthe murderers were upon them; and, having no other way, threw themselves\ndown headlong into the city; whereby, in my opinion, they underwent a more\nmiserable destruction than that which they avoided, because that was a\nvoluntary one. And now the outer temple was all of it overflowed with blood;\nand that day, as it came on, they saw eight thousand five hundred dead\nbodies there.", "But the rage of the Idumeans was not satiated by these slaughters;\nbut they now betook themselves to the city, and plundered every house,\nand slew every one they met; and for the other multitude, they esteemed\nit needless to go on with killing them, but they sought for the high priests,\nand the generality went with the greatest zeal against them; and as soon\nas they caught them they slew them, and then standing upon their dead bodies,\nin way of jest, upbraided Ananus with his kindness to the people, and Jesus\nwith his speech made to them from the wall. Nay, they proceeded to that\ndegree of impiety, as to cast away their dead bodies without burial, although\nthe Jews used to take so much care of the burial of men, that they took\ndown those that were condemned and crucified, and buried them before the\ngoing down of the sun. I should not mistake if I said that the death of\nAnanus was the beginning of the destruction of the city, and that from\nthis very day may be dated the overthrow of her wall, and the ruin of her\naffairs, whereon they saw their high priest, and the procurer of their\npreservation, slain in the midst of their city. He was on other accounts\nalso a venerable, and a very just man; and besides the grandeur of that\nnobility, and dignity, and honor of which he was possessed, he had been\na lover of a kind of parity, even with regard to the meanest of the people;\nhe was a prodigious lover of liberty, and an admirer of a democracy in\ngovernment; and did ever prefer the public welfare before his own advantage,\nand preferred peace above all things; for he was thoroughly sensible that\nthe Romans were not to be conquered. He also foresaw that of necessity\na war would follow, and that unless the Jews made up matters with them\nvery dexterously, they would be destroyed; to say all in a word, if Ananus\nhad survived, they had certainly compounded matters; for he was a shrewd\nman in speaking and persuading the people, and had already gotten the mastery\nof those that opposed his designs, or were for the war. And the Jews had\nthen put abundance of delays in the way of the Romans, if they had had\nsuch a general as he was. Jesus was also joined with him; and although\nhe was inferior to him upon the comparison, he was superior to the rest;\nand I cannot but think that it was because God had doomed this city to\ndestruction, as a polluted city, and was resolved to purge his sanctuary\nby fire, that he cut off these their great defenders and well-wishers,\nwhile those that a little before had worn the sacred garments, and had\npresided over the public worship; and had been esteemed venerable by those\nthat dwelt on the whole habitable earth when they came into our city, were\ncast out naked, and seen to be the food of dogs and wild beasts. And I\ncannot but imagine that virtue itself groaned at these men's case, and\nlamented that she was here so terribly conquered by wickedness. And this\nat last was the end of Ananus and Jesus.", "Now after these were slain, the zealots and the multitude of the\nIdumeans fell upon the people as upon a flock of profane animals, and cut\ntheir throats; and for the ordinary sort, they were destroyed in what place\nsoever they caught them. But for the noblemen and the youth, they first\ncaught them and bound them, and shut them up in prison, and put off their\nslaughter, in hopes that some of them would turn over to their party; but\nnot one of them would comply with their desires, but all of them preferred\ndeath before being enrolled among such wicked wretches as acted against\ntheir own country. But this refusal of theirs brought upon them terrible\ntorments; for they were so scourged and tortured, that their bodies were\nnot able to sustain their torments, till at length, and with difficulty,\nthey had the favor to be slain. Those whom they caught in the day time\nwere slain in the night, and then their bodies were carried out and thrown\naway, that there might be room for other prisoners; and the terror that\nwas upon the people was so great, that no one had courage enough either\nto weep openly for the dead man that was related to him, or to bury him;\nbut those that were shut up in their own houses could only shed tears in\nsecret, and durst not even groan without great caution, lest any of their\nenemies should hear them; for if they did, those that mourned for others\nsoon underwent the same death with those whom they mourned for. Only in\nthe night time they would take up a little dust, and throw it upon their\nbodies; and even some that were the most ready to expose themselves to\ndanger would do it in the day time: and there were twelve thousand of the\nbetter sort who perished in this manner.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Some\ncommentators are ready to suppose that this\" Zacharias, the son of\nBaruch,\" here most unjustly slain by the Jews in the temple, was the\nvery same person with \"Zacharias, the son of Barachias,\" whom\nour Savior says the Jews \"slew between the temple and the altar,\"\nMatthew 23:35. This is a somewhat strange exposition; since Zechariah the\nprophet was really \"the son of Barachiah,\" and \"grandson\nof Iddo, Zechariah 1:1; and how he died, we have no other account than\nthat before us in St. Matthew: while this \"Zacharias\" was \"the\nson of Baruch.\" Since the slaughter was past when our Savior spake\nthese words, the Jews had then already slain him; whereas this slaughter\nof \"Zacharias, the son of Baruch,\" in Josephus, was then about\nthirty-four years future.

Nor do I believe that our Josephus, who always insists on the peculiar\nsacredness of the inmost court, and of the holy house that was in it, would\nhave omitted so material an aggravation of this barbarous murder, as perpetrated\nin. a place so very holy, had that been the true place of it. See Antiq.\nB. XI. ch. 7. sect. 1, and the note here on B. V. ch. 1. sect. 2."}, "#text": "And now these zealots and Idumeans were quite weary of barely killing\nmen, so they had the impudence of setting up fictitious tribunals and judicatures\nfor that purpose; and as they intended to have Zacharias \nthe son of Baruch, one of the most eminent of the citizens, slain, - so\nwhat provoked them against him was, that hatred of wickedness and love\nof liberty which were so eminent in him: he was also a rich man, so that\nby taking him off, they did not only hope to seize his effects, but also\nto get rid of a mall that had great power to destroy them. So they called\ntogether, by a public proclamation, seventy of the principal men of the\npopulace, for a show, as if they were real judges, while they had no proper\nauthority. Before these was Zacharias accused of a design to betray their\npolity to the Romans, and having traitorously sent to Vespasian for that\npurpose. Now there appeared no proof or sign of what he was accused; but\nthey affirmed themselves that they were well persuaded that so it was,\nand desired that such their affirmation might he taken for sufficient evidence.\nNow when Zacharias clearly saw that there was no way remaining for his\nescape from them, as having been treacherously called before them, and\nthen put in prison, but not with any intention of a legal trial, he took\ngreat liberty of speech in that despair of his life he was under. Accordingly\nhe stood up, and laughed at their pretended accusation, and in a few words\nconfuted the crimes laid to his charge; after which he turned his speech\nto his accusers, and went over distinctly all their transgressions of the\nlaw, and made heavy lamentation upon the confusion they had brought public\naffairs to: in the mean time, the zealots grew tumultuous, and had much\nado to abstain from drawing their swords, although they designed to preserve\nthe appearance and show of judicature to the end. They were also desirous,\non other accounts, to try the judges, whether they would be mindful of\nwhat was just at their own peril. Now the seventy judges brought in their\nverdict that the person accused was not guilty, as choosing rather to die\nthemselves with him, than to have his death laid at their doors; hereupon\nthere arose a great clamor of the zealots upon his acquittal, and they\nall had indignation at the judges for not understanding that the authority\nthat was given them was but in jest. So two of the boldest of them fell\nupon Zacharias in the middle of the temple, and slew him; and as he fell\ndown dead, they bantered him, and said, \"Thou hast also our verdict,\nand this will prove a more sure acquittal to thee than the other.\"\nThey also threw him down from the temple immediately into the valley beneath\nit. Moreover, they struck the judges with the backs of their swords, by\nway of abuse, and thrust them out of the court of the temple, and spared\ntheir lives with no other design than that, when they were dispersed among\nthe people in the city, they might become their messengers, to let them\nknow they were no better than slaves."}, "But by this time the Idumeans repented of their coming, and were\ndispleased at what had been done; and when they were assembled together\nby one of the zealots, who had come privately to them, he declared to them\nwhat a number of wicked pranks they had themselves done in conjunction\nwith those that invited them, and gave a particular account of what mischiefs\nhad been done against their metropolis. - He said that they had taken arms,\nas though the high priests were betraying their metropolis to the Romans,\nbut had found no indication of any such treachery; but that they had succored\nthose that had pretended to believe such a thing, while they did themselves\nthe works of war and tyranny, after an insolent manner. It had been indeed\ntheir business to have hindered them from such their proceedings at the\nfirst, but seeing they had once been partners with them in shedding the\nblood of their own countrymen, it was high time to put a stop to such crimes,\nand not continue to afford any more assistance to such as are subverting\nthe laws of their forefathers; for that if any had taken it ill that the\ngates had been shut against them, and they had not been permitted to come\ninto the city, yet that those who had excluded them have been punished,\nand Ananus is dead, and that almost all those people had been destroyed\nin one night's time. That one may perceive many of themselves now repenting\nfor what they had done, and might see the horrid barbarity of those that\nhad invited them, and that they had no regard to such as had saved them;\nthat they were so impudent as to perpetrate the vilest things, under the\neyes of those that had supported them, and that their wicked actions would\nbe laid to the charge of the Idumeans, and would be so laid to their charge\ntill somebody obstructs their proceedings, or separates himself from the\nsame wicked action; that they therefore ought to retire home, since the\nimputation of treason appears to be a Calumny, and that there was no expectation\nof the coming of the Romans at this time, and that the government of the\ncity was secured by such walls as cannot easily be thrown down; and, by\navoiding any further fellowship with these bad men, to make some excuse\nfor themselves, as to what they had been so far deluded, as to have been\npartners with them hitherto.", "THE Idumeans complied with these persuasions; and, in the first place,\nthey set those that were in the prisons at liberty, being about two thousand\nof the populace, who thereupon fled away immediately to Simon, one whom\nwe shall speak of presently. After which these Idumeans retired from Jerusalem,\nand went home; which departure of theirs was a great surprise to both parties;\nfor the people, not knowing of their repentance, pulled up their courage\nfor a while, as eased of so many of their enemies, while the zealots grew\nmore insolent not as deserted by their confederates, but as freed from\nsuch men as might hinder their designs, and plat some stop to their wickedness.\nAccordingly, they made no longer any delay, nor took any deliberation in\ntheir enormous practices, but made use of the shortest methods for all\ntheir executions and what they had once resolved upon, they put in practice\nsooner than any one could imagine. But their thirst was chiefly after the\nblood of valiant men, and men of good families; the one sort of which they\ndestroyed out of envy, the other out of fear; for they thought their whole\nsecurity lay in leaving no potent men alive; on which account they slew\nGorion, a person eminent in dignity, and on account of his family also;\nhe was also for democracy, and of as great boldness and freedom of spirit\nas were any of the Jews whosoever; the principal thing that ruined him,\nadded to his other advantages, was his free speaking. Nor did Niger of\nPeres escape their hands; he had been a man of great valor in their war\nwith the Romans, but was now drawn through the middle of the city, and,\nas he went, he frequently cried out, and showed the scars of his wounds;\nand when he was drawn out of the gates, and despaired of his preservation,\nhe besought them to grant him a burial; but as they had threatened him\nbeforehand not to grant him any spot of earth for a grave, which he chiefly\ndesired of them, so did they slay him [without permitting him to be buried].\nNow when they were slaying him, he made this imprecation upon them, that\nthey might undergo both famine and pestilence in this war, and besides\nall that, they might come to the mutual slaughter of one another; all which\nimprecations God confirmed against these impious men, and was what came\nmost justly upon them, when not long afterward. they tasted of their own\nmadness in their mutual seditions one against another. So when this Niger\nwas killed, their fears of being overturned were diminished; and indeed\nthere was no part of the people but they found out some pretense to destroy\nthem; for some were therefore slain, because they had had differences with\nsome of them; and as to those that had not opposed them in times of peace,\nthey watched seasonable opportunities to gain some accusation against them;\nand if any one did not come near them at all, he was under their suspicion\nas a proud man; if any one came with boldness, he was esteemed a contemner\nof them; and if any one came as aiming to oblige them, he was supposed\nto have some treacherous plot against them; while the only punishment of\ncrimes, whether they were of the greatest or smallest sort, was death.\nNor could any one escape, unless he were very inconsiderable, either on\naccount of the meanness of his birth, or on account of his fortune.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This prediction, that the city (Jerusalem) should then \"be taken,\nand the sanctuary burnt, by right of war, when a sedition should invade\nJews, and their own hands should pollute that temple;\" or, as it is\nB.

But this prediction, as Josephus\nwell remarks here, though, with the other predictions of the prophets,\nit was now laughed at by the seditious, was by their very means soon exactly\nfulfilled. However, I cannot but here take notice of Grotius's positive\nassertion upon Matthew 26:9, here quoted by Dr. Hudson, that \"it ought\nto be taken for granted, as a certain truth, that many predictions of the\nJewish prophets were preserved, not in writing, but by memory.\" Whereas,\nit seems to me so far from certain, that I think it has no evidence nor\nprobability at all."}, "#text": "And now all the rest of the commanders of the Romans deemed this\nsedition among their enemies to be of great advantage to them, and were\nvery earnest to march to the city, and they urged Vespasian, as their lord\nand general in all cases, to make haste, and said to him, that \"the\nprovidence of God is on our side, by setting our enemies at variance against\none another; that still the change in such cases may be sudden, and the\nJews may quickly be at one again, either because they may be tired out\nwith their civil miseries, or repent them of such doings.\" But Vespasian\nreplied, that they were greatly mistaken in what they thought fit to be\ndone, as those that, upon the theater, love to make a show of their hands,\nand of their weapons, but do it at their own hazard, without considering,\nwhat was for their advantage, and for their security; for that if they\nnow go and attack the city immediately, they shall but occasion their enemies\nto unite together, and shall convert their force, now it is in its height,\nagainst themselves. But if they stay a while, they shall have fewer enemies,\nbecause they will be consumed in this sedition: that God acts as a general\nof the Romans better than he can do, and is giving the Jews up to them\nwithout any pains of their own, and granting their army a victory without\nany danger; that therefore it is their best way, while their enemies are\ndestroying each other with their own hands, and falling into the greatest\nof misfortunes, which is that of sedition, to sit still as spectators of\nthe dangers they run into, rather than to fight hand to hand with men that\nlove murdering, and are mad one against another. But if any one imagines\nthat the glory of victory, when it is gotten without fighting, will be\nmore insipid, let him know this much, that a glorious success, quietly\nobtained, is more profitable than the dangers of a battle; for we ought\nto esteem these that do what is agreeable to temperance and prudence no\nless glorious than those that have gained great reputation by their actions\nin war: that he shall lead on his army with greater force when their enemies\nare diminished, and his own army refreshed after the continual labors they\nhad undergone. However, that this is not a proper time to propose to ourselves\nthe glory of victory; for that the Jews are not now employed in making\nof armor or building of walls, nor indeed in getting together auxiliaries,\nwhile the advantage will be on their side who give them such opportunity\nof delay; but that the Jews are vexed to pieces every day by their civil\nwars and dissensions, and are under greater miseries than, if they were\nonce taken, could be inflicted on them by us. Whether therefore any one\nhath regard to what is for our safety, he ought to suffer these Jews to\ndestroy one another; or whether he hath regard to the greater glory of\nthe action, we ought by no means to meddle with those men, now they are\nafflicted with a distemper at home; for should we now conquer them, it\nwould be said the conquest was not owing to our bravery, but to their sedition.\""}, "And now the commanders joined in their approbation of what Vespasian\nhad said, and it was soon discovered how wise an opinion he had given.\nAnd indeed many there were of the Jews that deserted every day, and fled\naway from the zealots, although their flight was very difficult, since\nthey had guarded every passage out of the city, and slew every one that\nwas caught at them, as taking it for granted they were going over to the\nRomans; yet did he who gave them money get clear off, while he only that\ngave them none was voted a traitor. So the upshot was this, that the rich\npurchased their flight by money, while none but the poor were slain. Along\nall the roads also vast numbers of dead bodies lay in heaps, and even many\nof those that were so zealous in deserting at length chose rather to perish\nwithin the city; for the hopes of burial made death in their own city appear\nof the two less terrible to them. But these zealots came at last to that\ndegree of barbarity, as not to bestow a burial either on those slain in\nthe city, or on those that lay along the roads; but as if they had made\nan agreement to cancel both the laws of their country and the laws of nature,\nand, at the same time that they defiled men with their wicked actions,\nthey would pollute the Divinity itself also, they left the dead bodies\nto putrefy under the sun; and the same punishment was allotted to such\nas buried any as to those that deserted, which was no other than death;\nwhile he that granted the favor of a grave to another would presently stand\nin need of a grave himself. To say all in a word, no other gentle passion\nwas so entirely lost among them as mercy; for what were the greatest objects\nof pity did most of all irritate these wretches, and they transferred their\nrage from the living to those that had been slain, and from the dead to\nthe living. Nay, the terror was so very great, that he who survived called\nthem that were first dead happy, as being at rest already; as did those\nthat were under torture in the prisons, declare, that, upon this comparison,\nthose that lay unburied were the happiest. These men, therefore, trampled\nupon all the laws of men, and laughed at the laws of God; and for the oracles\nof the prophets, they ridiculed them as the tricks of jugglers; yet did\nthese prophets foretell many things concerning [the rewards of] virtue,\nand [punishments of] vice, which when these zealots violated, they occasioned\nthe fulfilling of those very prophecies belonging to their own country;\nfor there was a certain ancient oracle of those men, that the city should\nthen be taken and the sanctuary burnt, by right of war, when a sedition\nshould invade the Jews, and their own hand should pollute the temple of\nGod. Now while these zealots did not [quite] disbelieve these predictions,\nthey made themselves the instruments of their accomplishment.", "BY this time John was beginning to tyrannize, and thought it beneath\nhim to accept of barely the same honors that others had; and joining to\nhimself by degrees a party of the wickedest of them all, he broke off from\nthe rest of the faction. This was brought about by his still disagreeing\nwith the opinions of others, and giving out injunctions of his own, in\na very imperious manner; so that it was evident he was setting up a monarchical\npower. Now some submitted to him out of their fear of him, and others out\nof their good-will to him; for he was a shrewd man to entice men to him,\nboth by deluding them and putting cheats upon them. Nay, many there were\nthat thought they should be safer themselves, if the causes of their past\ninsolent actions should now be reduced to one head, and not to a great\nmany. His activity was so great, and that both in action and in counsel,\nthat he had not a few guards about him; yet was there a great party of\nhis antagonists that left him; among whom envy at him weighed a great deal,\nwhile they thought it a very heavy thing to be in subjection to one that\nwas formerly their equal. But the main reason that moved men against him\nwas the dread of monarchy, for they could not hope easily to put an end\nto his power, if he had once obtained it; and yet they knew that he would\nhave this pretense always against them, that they had opposed him when\nhe was first advanced; while every one chose rather to suffer any thing\nwhatsoever in war, than that, when they had been in a voluntary slavery\nfor some time, they should afterward perish. So the sedition was divided\ninto two parts, and John reigned in opposition to his adversaries over\none of them: but for their leaders, they watched one another, nor did they\nat all, or at least very little, meddle with arms in their quarrels; but\nthey fought earnestly against the people, and contended one with another\nwhich of them should bring home the greatest prey. But because the city\nhad to struggle with three of the greatest misfortunes, war, and tyranny,\nand sedition, it appeared, upon the comparison, that the war was the least\ntroublesome to the populace of them all. Accordingly, they ran away from\ntheir own houses to foreigners, and obtained that preservation from the\nRomans which they despaired to obtain among their own people.", {"term": "Sicarii", "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "By these hiera, or \"holy places,\" as distinct from cities, must\nbe meant \"proseuchae,\" or \"houses of prayer,\" out of\ncities; of which we find mention made in the New Testament and other authors.\nSee Luke 6:12; Acts 16:13, 16; Antiq.

There was a fortress of very great strength not far from Jerusalem,\nwhich had been built by our ancient kings, both as a repository for their\neffects in the hazards of war, and for the preservation of their bodies\nat the same time. It was called Masada. Those that were called \nhad taken possession of it formerly, but at this time they overran the\nneighboring countries, aiming only to procure to themselves necessaries;\nfor the fear they were then in prevented their further ravages. But when\nonce they were informed that the Roman army lay still, and that the Jews\nwere divided between sedition and tyranny, they boldly undertook greater\nmatters; and at the feast of unleavened bread, which the Jews celebrate\nin memory of their deliverance from the Egyptian bondage, when they were\nsent back into the country of their forefathers, they came down by night,\nwithout being discovered by those that could have prevented them, and overran\na certain small city called Engaddi:--in which expedition they prevented\nthose citizens that could have stopped them, before they could arm themselves,\nand fight them. They also dispersed them, and cast them out of the city.\nAs for such as could not run away, being women and children, they slew\nof them above seven hundred. Afterward, when they had carried every thing\nout of their houses, and had seized upon all the fruits that were in a\nflourishing condition, they brought them into Masada. And indeed these\nmen laid all the villages that were about the fortress waste, and made\nthe whole country desolate; while there came to them every day, from all\nparts, not a few men as corrupt as themselves. At that time all the other\nregions of Judea that had hitherto been at rest were in motion, by means\nof the robbers. Now as it is in a human body, if the principal part be\ninflamed, all the members are subject to the same distemper; so, by means\nof the sedition and disorder that was in the metropolis,. had the wicked\nmen that were in the country opportunity to ravage the same. Accordingly,\nwhen every one of them had plundered their own villages, they then retired\ninto the desert; yet were these men that now got together, and joined in\nthe conspiracy by parties, too small for an army, and too many for a gang\nof thieves: and thus did they fall upon the holy places \nand the cities; yet did it now so happen that they were sometimes very\nill treated by those upon whom they fell with such violence, and were taken\nby them as men are taken in war: but still they prevented any further punishment\nas do robbers, who, as soon as their ravages [are discovered], run their\nway. Nor was there now any part of Judea that was not in a miserable condition,\nas well as its most eminent city also."}, "These things were told Vespasian by deserters; for although the seditious\nwatched all the passages out of the city, and destroyed all, whosoever\nthey were, that came thither, yet were there some that had concealed themselves,\nand when they had fled to the Romans, persuaded their general to come to\ntheir city's assistance, and save the remainder of the people; informing\nhim withal, that it was upon account of the people's good-will to the Romans\nthat many of them were already slain, and the survivors in danger of the\nsame treatment. Vespasian did indeed already pity the calamities these\nmen were in, and arose, in appearance, as though he was going to besiege\nJerusalem, but in reality to deliver them from a [worse] siege they were\nalready under. However, he was obliged first to overthrow what remained\nelsewhere, and to leave nothing out of Jerusalem behind him that might\ninterrupt him in that siege. Accordingly, he marched against Gadara, the\nmetropolis of Perea, which was a place of strength, and entered that city\non the fourth day of the month Dystrus [Adar]; for the men of power had\nsent an embassage to him, without the knowledge of the seditious, to treat\nabout a surrender; which they did out of the desire they had of peace,\nand for saving their effects, because many of the citizens of Gadara were\nrich men. This embassy the opposite party knew nothing of, but discovered\nit as Vespasian was approaching near the city. However, they despaired\nof keeping possession of the city, as being inferior in number to their\nenemies who were within the city, and seeing the Romans very near to the\ncity; so they resolved to fly, but thought it dishonorable to do it without\nshedding some blood, and revenging themselves on the authors of this surrender;\nso they seized upon Dolesus, (a person not only the first in rank and family\nin that city, but one that seemed the occasion of sending such an embassy,)\nand slew him, and treated his dead body after a barbarous manner, so very\nviolent was their anger at him, and then ran out of the city. And as now\nthe Roman army was just upon them, the people of Gadara admitted Vespasian\nwith joyful acclamations, and received from him the security of his right\nhand, as also a garrison of horsemen and footmen, to guard them against\nthe excursions of the runagates; for as to their wall, they had pulled\nit down before the Romans desired them so to do, that they might thereby\ngive them assurance that they were lovers of peace, and that, if they had\na mind, they could not now make war against them.", "And now Vespasian sent Placidus against those that had fled from\nGadara, with five hundred horsemen, and three thousand footmen, while he\nreturned himself to Cesarea, with the rest of the army. But as soon as\nthese fugitives saw the horsemen that pursued them just upon their backs,\nand before they came to a close fight, they ran together to a certain village,\nwhich was called Bethennabris, where finding a great multitude of young\nmen, and arming them, partly by their own consent, partly by force, they\nrashly and suddenly assaulted Placidus and the troops that were with him.\nThese horsemen at the first onset gave way a little, as contriving to entice\nthem further off the wall; and when they had drawn them into a place fit\nfor their purpose, they made their horse encompass them round, and threw\ntheir darts at them. So the horsemen cut off the flight of the fugitives,\nwhile the foot terribly destroyed those that fought against them; for those\nJews did no more than show their courage, and then were destroyed; for\nas they fell upon the Romans when they were joined close together, and,\nas it were, walled about with their entire armor, they were not able to\nfind any place where the darts could enter, nor were they any way able\nto break their ranks, while they were themselves run through by the Roman\ndarts, and, like the wildest of wild beasts, rushed upon the point of others'\nswords; so some of them were destroyed, as cut with their enemies' swords\nupon their faces, and others were dispersed by the horsemen.", "Now Placidus's concern was to exclude them in their flight from getting\ninto the village; and causing his horse to march continually on that side\nof them, he then turned short upon them, and at the same time his men made\nuse of their darts, and easily took their aim at those that were the nearest\nto them, as they made those that were further off turn back by the terror\nthey were in, till at last the most courageous of them brake through those\nhorsemen and fled to the wall of the village. And now those that guarded\nthe wall were in great doubt what to do; for they could not bear the thoughts\nof excluding those that came from Gadara, because of their own people that\nwere among them; and yet, if they should admit them, they expected to perish\nwith them, which came to pass accordingly; for as they were crowding together\nat the wall, the Roman horsemen were just ready to fall in with them. However,\nthe guards prevented them, and shut the gates, when Placidus made an assault\nupon them, and fighting courageously till it was dark, he got possession\nof the wall, and of the people that were in the city, when the useless\nmultitude were destroyed; but those that were more potent ran away, and\nthe soldiers plundered the houses, and set the village on fire. As for\nthose that ran out of the village, they stirred up such as were in the\ncountry, and exaggerating their own calamities, and telling them that the\nwhole army of the Romans were upon them, they put them into great fear\non every side; so they got in great numbers together, and fled to Jericho,\nfor they knew no other place that could afford them any hope of escaping,\nit being a city that had a strong wall, and a great multitude of inhabitants.\nBut Placidus, relying much upon his horsemen, and his former good success,\nfollowed them, and slew all that he overtook, as far as Jordan; and when\nhe had driven the whole multitude to the river-side, where they were stopped\nby the current, (for it had been augmented lately by rains, and was not\nfordable,) he put his soldiers in array over against them; so the necessity\nthe others were in provoked them to hazard a battle, because there was\nno place whither they could flee. They then extended themselves a very\ngreat way along the banks of the river, and sustained the darts that were\nthrown at them, as well as the attacks of the horsemen, who beat many of\nthem, and pushed them into the current. At which fight, hand to hand, fifteen\nthousand of them were slain, while the number of those that were unwillingly\nforced to leap into Jordan was prodigious. There were besides two thousand\nand two hundred taken prisoners. A mighty prey was taken also, consisting\nof asses, and sheep, and camels, and oxen.", "Now this destruction that fell upon the Jews, as it was not inferior\nto any of the rest in itself, so did it still appear greater than it really\nwas; and this, because not only the whole country through which they fled\nwas filled with slaughter, and Jordan could not be passed over, by reason\nof the dead bodies that were in it, but because the lake Asphaltiris was\nalso full of dead bodies, that were carried down into it by the river.\nAnd now Placidus, after this good success that he had, fell violently upon\nthe neighboring smaller cities and villages; when he took Abila, and Julias,\nand Bezemoth, and all those that lay as far as the lake Asphaltitis, and\nput such of the deserters into each of them as he thought proper. He then\nput his soldiers on board the ships, and slew such as had fled to the lake,\ninsomuch that all Perea had either surrendered themselves, or were taken\nby the Romans, as far as Macherus.", "IN the mean time, an account came that there were commotions in Gall,\nand that Vindex, together with the men of power in that country, had revolted\nfrom Nero; which affair is more accurately described elsewhere. This report,\nthus related to Vespasian, excited him to go on briskly with the war; for\nhe foresaw already the civil wars which were coming upon them, nay, that\nthe very government was in danger; and he thought, if he could first reduce\nthe eastern parts of the empire to peace, he should make the fears for\nItaly the lighter; while therefore the winter was his hinderance [from\ngoing into the field], he put garrisons into the villages and smaller cities\nfor their security; he put decurions also into the villages, and centurions\ninto the cities: he besides this rebuilt many of the cities that had been\nlaid waste; but at the beginning of the spring he took the greatest part\nof his army, and led it from Cesarea to Antipatris, where he spent two\ndays in settling the affairs of that city, and then, on the third day,\nhe marched on, laying waste and burning all the neighboring villages. And\nwhen he had laid waste all the places about the toparchy of Thamnas, he\npassed on to Lydda and Jamnia; and when both these cities had come over\nto him, he placed a great many of those that had come over to him [from\nother places] as inhabitants therein, and then came to Emmaus, where he\nseized upon the passage which led thence to their metropolis, and fortified\nhis camp, and leaving the fifth legion therein, he came to the toparchy\nof Bethletephon. He then destroyed that place, and the neighboring places,\nby fire, and fortified, at proper places, the strong holds all about Idumea;\nand when he had seized upon two villages, which were in the very midst\nof Idumea, Betaris and Caphartobas, he slew above ten thousand of the people,\nand carried into captivity above a thousand, and drove away the rest of\nthe multitude, and placed no small part of his own forces in them, who\noverran and laid waste the whole mountainous country; while he, with the\nrest of his forces, returned to Emmaus, whence he came down through the\ncountry of Samaria, and hard by the city, by others called Neapoils, (or\nSichem,) but by the people of that country Mabortha, to Corea, where he\npitched his camp, on the second day of the month Desius [Sivan]; and on\nthe day following he came to Jericho; on which day Trajan, one of his commanders,\njoined him with the forces he brought out of Perea, all the places beyond\nJordan being subdued already.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Whether this Somorrhon, or Somorrha, ought not to be here written Gomorrha,\nas some MSS. in a manner have it, (for the place meant by Josephus seems\nto be near Segor, or Zoar, at the very south of the Dead Sea, hard by which\nstood Sodom and Gomorrha,) cannot now be certainly determined, but seems\nby no means improbable."}, "#text": "Hereupon a great multitude prevented their approach, and came out\nof Jericho, and fled to those mountainous parts that lay over against Jerusalem,\nwhile that part which was left behind was in a great measure destroyed;\nthey also found the city desolate. It is situated in a plain; but a naked\nand barren mountain, of a very great length, hangs over it, which extends\nitself to the land about Scythopolis northward, but as far as the country\nof Sodom, and the utmost limits of the lake Asphaltiris, southward. This\nmountain is all of it very uneven and uninhabited, by reason of its barrenness:\nthere is an opposite mountain that is situated over against it, on the\nother side of Jordan; this last begins at Julias, and the northern quarters,\nand extends itself southward as far as Somorrhon, \nwhich is the bounds of Petra, in Arabia. In this ridge of mountains there\nis one called the Iron Mountain, that runs in length as far as Moab. Now\nthe region that lies in the middle between these ridges of mountains is\ncalled the Great Plain; it reaches from the village Ginnabris, as far as\nthe lake Asphaltitis; its length is two hundred and thirty furlongs, and\nits breadth a hundred and twenty, and it is divided in the midst by Jordan.\nIt hath two lakes in it, that of Asphaltitis, and that of Tiberias, whose\nnatures are opposite to each other; for the former is salt and unfruitful,\nbut that of Tiberias is sweet and fruitful. This plain is much burnt up\nin summer time, and, by reason of the extraordinary heat, contains a very\nunwholesome air; it is all destitute of water excepting the river Jordan,\nwhich water of Jordan is the occasion why those plantations of palm trees\nthat are near its banks are more flourishing, and much more fruitful, as\nare those that are remote from it not so flourishing, or fruitful."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This excellent prayer of Elisha is wanting in our copies, 2 Kings 2:21,\n22, though it be referred to also in the Apostolical Constitutions, B.\nVII. ch. 37., and the success of it is mentioned in them all."}, "#text": "Notwithstanding which, there is a fountain by Jericho, that runs\nplentifully, and is very fit for watering the ground; it arises near the\nold city, which Joshua, the son of Naue, the general of the Hebrews, took\nthe first of all the cities of the land of Canaan, by right of war. The\nreport is, that this fountain, at the beginning, caused not only the blasting\nof the earth and the trees, but of the children born of women, and that\nit was entirely of a sickly and corruptive nature to all things whatsoever;\nbut that it was made gentle, and very wholesome and fruitful, by the prophet\nElisha. This prophet was familiar with Elijah, and was his successor, who,\nwhen he once was the guest of the people at Jericho, and the men of the\nplace had treated him very kindly, he both made them amends as well as\nthe country, by a lasting favor; for he went out of the city to this fountain,\nand threw into the current an earthen vessel full of salt; after which\nhe stretched out his righteous hand unto heaven, and, pouring out a mild\ndrink-offering, he made this supplication, - That the current might be\nmollified, and that the veins of fresh water might be opened; that God\nalso would bring into the place a more temperate and fertile air for the\ncurrent, and would bestow upon the people of that country plenty of the\nfruits of the earth, and a succession of children; and that this prolific\nwater might never fail them, while they continued to he righteous. To these\nprayers Elisha \njoined proper operations of his hands, after a skillful manner, and changed\nthe fountain; and that water, which had been the occasion of barrenness\nand famine before, from that time did supply a numerous posterity, and\nafforded great abundance to the country. Accordingly, the power of it is\nso great in watering the ground, that if it do but once touch a country,\nit affords a sweeter nourishment than other waters do, when they lie so\nlong upon them, till they are satiated with them. For which reason, the\nadvantage gained from other waters, when they flow in great plenty, is\nbut small, while that of this water is great when it flows even in little\nquantities. Accordingly, it waters a larger space of ground than any other\nwaters do, and passes along a plain of seventy furlongs long, and twenty\nbroad; wherein it affords nourishment to those most excellent gardens that\nare thick set with trees. There are in it many sorts of palm trees that\nare watered by it, different from each other in taste and name; the better\nsort of them, when they are pressed, yield an excellent kind of honey,\nnot much inferior in sweetness to other honey. This country withal produces\nhoney from bees; it also bears that balsam which is the most precious of\nall the fruits in that place, cypress trees also, and those that bear myrobalanum;\nso that he who should pronounce this place to be divine would not be mistaken,\nwherein is such plenty of trees produced as are very rare, and of the must\nexcellent sort. And indeed, if we speak of those other fruits, it will\nnot be easy to light on any climate in the habitable earth that can well\nbe compared to it, - what is here sown comes up in such clusters; the cause\nof which seems to me to be the warmth of the air, and the fertility of\nthe waters; the warmth calling forth the sprouts, and making them spread,\nand the moisture making every one of them take root firmly, and supplying\nthat virtue which it stands in need of in summer time. Now this country\nis then so sadly burnt up, that nobody cares to come at it; and if the\nwater be drawn up before sun-rising, and after that exposed to the air,\nit becomes exceeding cold, and becomes of a nature quite contrary to the\nambient air; as in winter again it becomes warm; and if you go into it,\nit appears very gentle. The ambient air is here also of so good a temperature,\nthat the people of the country are clothed in linen-only, even when snow\ncovers the rest of Judea. This place is one hundred and fifty furlongs\nfrom Jerusalem, and sixty from Jordan. The country, as far as Jerusalem,\nis desert and stony; but that as far as Jordan and the lake Asphaltitis\nlies lower indeed, though it be equally desert and barren. But so much\nshall suffice to have said about Jericho, and of the great happiness of\nits situation."}, "The nature of the lake Asphaltitis is also worth describing. It is,\nas I have said already, bitter and unfruitful. It is so light [or thick]\nthat it bears up the heaviest things that are thrown into it; nor is it\neasy for any one to make things sink therein to the bottom, if he had a\nmind so to do. Accordingly, when Vespasian went to see it, he commanded\nthat some who could not swim should have their hands tied behind them,\nand be thrown into the deep, when it so happened that they all swam as\nif a wind had forced them upwards. Moreover, the change of the color of\nthis lake is wonderful, for it changes its appearance thrice every day;\nand as the rays of the sun fall differently upon it, the light is variously\nreflected. However, it casts up black clods of bitumen in many parts of\nit; these swim at the top of the water, and resemble both in shape and\nbigness headless bulls; and when the laborers that belong to the lake come\nto it, and catch hold of it as it hangs together, they draw it into their\nships; but when the ship is full, it is not easy to cut off the rest, for\nit is so tenacious as to make the ship hang upon its clods till they set\nit loose with the menstrual blood of women, and with urine, to which alone\nit yields. This bitumen is not only useful for the caulking of ships, but\nfor the cure of men's bodies; accordingly, it is mixed in a great many\nmedicines. The length of this lake is five hundred and eighty furlongs,\nwhere it is extended as far as Zoar in Arabia; and its breadth is a hundred\nand fifty. The country of Sodom borders upon it. It was of old a most happy\nland, both for the fruits it bore and the riches of its cities, although\nit be now all burnt up. It is related how, for the impiety of its inhabitants,\nit was burnt by lightning; in consequence of which there are still the\nremainders of that Divine fire, and the traces [or shadows] of the five\ncities are still to be seen, as well as the ashes growing in their fruits;\nwhich fruits have a color as if they were fit to be eaten, but if you pluck\nthem with your hands, they dissolve into smoke and ashes. And thus what\nis related of this land of Sodom hath these marks of credibility which\nour very sight affords us.", "AND now Vespasian had fortified all the places round about Jerusalem,\nand erected citadels at Jericho and Adida, and placed garrisons in them\nboth, partly out of his own Romans, and partly out of the body of his auxiliaries.\nHe also sent Lucius Annius to Gerasa, and delivered to him a body of horsemen,\nand a considerable number of footmen. So when he had taken the city, which\nhe did at the first onset, he slew a thousand of those young men who had\nnot prevented him by flying away; but he took their families captive, and\npermitted his soldiers to plunder them of their effects; after which he\nset fire to their houses, and went away to the adjoining villages, while\nthe men of power fled away, and the weaker part were destroyed, and what\nwas remaining was all burnt down. And now the war having gone through all\nthe mountainous country, and all the plain country also, those that were\nat Jerusalem were deprived of the liberty of going out of the city; for\nas to such as had a mind to desert, they were watched by the zealots; and\nas to such as were not yet on the side of the Romans, their army kept them\nin, by encompassing the city round about on all sides.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Of these Roman affairs and tumults under Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, here\nonly touched upon by Josephus, see Tacitus, Suelonius, and Dio, more largely.\nHowever, we may observe with Ottius, that Josephus writes the name of the\nsecond of them not Otto, with many others, but Otho, with the coins.

Wherefore Vespasian put off at first his expedition\nagainst Jerusalem, and stood waiting whither the empire would be transferred\nafter the death of Nero. Moreover, when he heard that Galba was made emperor,\nhe attempted nothing till he also should send him some directions about\nthe war: however, he sent his son Titus to him, to salute him, and to receive\nhis commands about the Jews. Upon the very same errand did king Agrippa\nsail along with Titus to Galba; but as they were sailing in their long\nships by the coasts of Achaia, for it was winter time, they heard that\nGalba was slain, before they could get to him, after he had reigned seven\nmonths and as many days. After whom Otho took the government, and undertook\nthe management of public affairs. So Agrippa resolved to go on to Rome\nwithout any terror; on account of the change in the government; but Titus,\nby a Divine impulse, sailed back from Greece to Syria, and came in great\nhaste to Cesarea, to his father. And now they were both in suspense about\nthe public affairs, the Roman empire being then in a fluctuating condition,\nand did not go on with their expedition against the Jews, but thought that\nto make any attack upon foreigners was now unseasonable, on account of\nthe solicitude they were in for their own country."}, "And now there arose another war at Jerusalem. There was a son of\nGiora, one Simon, by birth of Gerasa, a young man, not so cunning indeed\nas John [of Gisehala], who had already seized upon the city, but superior\nin strength of body and courage; on which account, when he had been driven\naway from that Acrabattene toparchy, which he once had, by Ananus the high\npriest, he came to those robbers who had seized upon Masada. At the first\nthey suspected him, and only permitted him to come with the women he brought\nwith him into the lower part of the fortress, while they dwelt in the upper\npart of it themselves. However, his manner so well agreed with theirs,\nand he seemed so trusty a man, that he went out with them, and ravaged\nand destroyed the country with them about Masada; yet when he persuaded\nthem to undertake greater things, he could not prevail with them so to\ndo; for as they were accustomed to dwell in that citadel, they were afraid\nof going far from that which was their hiding-place; but he affecting to\ntyrannize, and being fond of greatness, when he had heard of the death\nof Ananus, he left them, and went into the mountainous part of the country.\nSo he proclaimed liberty to those in slavery, and a reward to those already\nfree, and got together a set of wicked men from all quarters.", "And as he had now a strong body of men about him, he overran the\nvillages that lay in the mountainous country, and when there were still\nmore and more that came to him, he ventured to go down into the lower parts\nof the country, and since he was now become formidable to the cities, many\nof the men of power were corrupted by him; so that his army was no longer\ncomposed of slaves and robbers, but a great many of the populace were obedient\nto him as to their king. He then overran the Acrabattene toparchy, and\nthe places that reached as far as the Great Idumea; for he built a wall\nat a certain village called Nain, and made use of that as a fortress for\nhis own party's security; and at the valley called Paran, he enlarged many\nof the caves, and many others he found ready for his purpose; these he\nmade use of as repositories for his treasures, and receptacles for his\nprey, and therein he laid up the fruits that he had got by rapine; and\nmany of his partizans had their dwelling in them; and he made no secret\nof it that he was exercising his men beforehand, and making preparations\nfor the assault of Jerusalem.", {"term": "Sicarii", "#text": "Whereupon the zealots, out of the dread they were in of his attacking\nthem, and being willing to prevent one that was growing up to oppose them,\nwent out against him with their weapons.

So he went back to Nain, as did the Idumeans\nreturn home. Nor was it long ere Simon came violently again upon their\ncountry; when he pitched his camp at a certain village called Thecoe, and\nsent Eleazar, one of his companions, to those that kept garrison at Herodium,\nand in order to persuade them to surrender that fortress to him. The garrison\nreceived this man readily, while they knew nothing of what he came about;\nbut as soon as he talked of the surrender of the place, they fell upon\nhim with their drawn swords, till he found that he had no place for flight,\nwhen he threw himself down from the wall into the valley beneath; so he\ndied immediately: but the Idumeans, who were already much afraid of Simon's\npower, thought fit to take a view of the enemy's army before they hazarded\na battle with them."}, "Now there was one of their commanders named Jacob, who offered to\nserve them readily upon that occasion, but had it in his mind to betray\nthem.

And as he was doing this, he invited Simon\nby his messengers, and promised him to disperse the Idumeans, which he\nperformed also; for as soon as their army was nigh them, he first of all\ngot upon his horse, and fled, together with those whom he had corrupted;\nhereupon a terror fell upon the whole multitude; and before it came to\na close fight, they broke their ranks, and every one retired to his own\nhome.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Some of the ancients call this famous tree, or grove, an oak others, a\nturpentine tree, or grove.

Now, besides this want of provisions that he was in,\nhe was of a barbarous disposition, and bore great anger at this nation,\nby which means it came to pass that Idumea was greatly depopulated; and\nas one may see all the woods behind despoiled of their leaves by locusts,\nafter they have been there, so was there nothing left behind Simon's army\nbut a desert.

Now\nthis Simon, who was without the wall, was a greater terror to the people\nthan the Romans themselves, as were the zealots who were within it more\nheavy upon them than both of the other; and during this time did the mischievous\ncontrivances and courage [of John] corrupt the body of the Galileans; for\nthese Galileans had advanced this John, and made him very potent, who made\nthem suitable requital from the authority he had obtained by their means;\nfor he permitted them to do all things that any of them desired to do,\nwhile their inclination to plunder was insatiable, as was their zeal in\nsearching the houses of the rich; and for the murdering of the men, and\nabusing of the women, it was sport to them. They also devoured what spoils\nthey had taken, together with their blood, and indulged themselves in feminine\nwantonness, without any disturbance, till they were satiated therewith;\nwhile they decked their hair, and put on women's garments, and were besmeared\nover with ointments; and that they might appear very comely, they had paints\nunder their eyes, and imitated not only the ornaments, but also the lusts\nof women, and were guilty of such intolerable uncleanness, that they invented\nunlawful pleasures of that sort. And thus did they roll themselves up and\ndown the city, as in a brothel-house, and defiled it entirely with their\nimpure actions; nay, while their faces looked like the faces of women,\nthey killed with their right hands; and when their gait was effeminate,\nthey presently attacked men, and became warriors, and drew their swords\nfrom under their finely dyed cloaks, and ran every body through whom they\nalighted upon. However, Simon waited for such as ran away from John, and\nwas the more bloody of the two; and he who had escaped the tyrant within\nthe wall was destroyed by the other that lay before the gates, so that\nall attempts of flying and deserting to the Romans were cut off, as to\nthose that had a mind so to do.", "Yet did the army that was under John raise a sedition against him,\nand all the Idumeans separated themselves from the tyrant, and attempted\nto destroy him, and this out of their envy at his power, and hatred of\nhis cruelty; so they got together, and slew many of the zealots, and drove\nthe rest before them into that royal palace that was built by Grapte, who\nwas a relation of Izates, the king of Adiabene; the Idumeans fell in with\nthem, and drove the zealots out thence into the temple, and betook themselves\nto plunder John's effects; for both he himself was in that palace, and\ntherein had he laid up the spoils he had acquired by his tyranny. In the\nmean time, the multitude of those zealots that were dispersed over the\ncity ran together to the temple unto those that fled thither, and John\nprepared to bring them down against the people and the Idumeans, who were\nnot so much afraid of being attacked by them (because they were themselves\nbetter soldiers than they) as at their madness, lest they should privately\nsally out of the temple and get among them, and not only destroy them,\nbut set the city on fire also. So they assembled themselves together, and\nthe high priests with them, and took counsel after what manner they should\navoid their assault. Now it was God who turned their opinions to the worst\nadvice, and thence they devised such a remedy to get themselves free as\nwas worse than the disease itself. Accordingly, in order to overthrow John,\nthey determined to admit Simon, and earnestly to desire the introduction\nof a second tyrant into the city; which resolution they brought to perfection,\nand sent Matthias, the high priest, to beseech this Simon to come ill to\nthem, of whom they had so often been afraid. Those also that had fled from\nthe zealots in Jerusalem joined in this request to him, out of the desire\nthey had of preserving their houses and their effects. Accordingly he,\nin an arrogant manner, granted them his lordly protection, and came into\nthe city, in order to deliver it from the zealots. The people also made\njoyful acclamations to him, as their savior and their preserver; but when\nhe was come in, with his army, he took care to secure his own authority,\nand looked upon those that had invited him in to be no less his enemies\nthan those against whom the invitation was intended.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This beginning and ending the observation of the Jewish seventh day, or\nsabbath, with a priest's blowing of a trumpet, is remarkable, and no where\nelse mentioned, that I know of.

Accordingly, he assembled the centurions\nand tribunes that were under his command, and persuaded them to go over\nto Antonius, and this by diminishing the reputation of Vitellius, and by\nexaggerating the power of Vespasian. He also told them that with the one\nthere was no more than the bare name of dominion, but with the other was\nthe power of it; and that it was better for them to prevent necessity,\nand gain favor, and, while they were likely to be overcome in battle, to\navoid the danger beforehand, and go over to Antonius willingly; that Vespasian\nwas able of himself to subdue what had not yet submitted without their\nassistance, while Vitellius could not preserve what he had already with\nit.", "Cecinna said this, and much more to the same purpose, and persuaded\nthem to comply with him; and both he and his army deserted; but still the\nvery same night the soldiers repented of what they had done, and a fear\nseized on them, lest perhaps Vitellius who sent them should get the better;\nand drawing their swords, they assaulted Cecinna, in order to kill him;\nand the thing had been done by them, if the tribunes had not fallen upon\ntheir knees, and besought them not to do it; so the soldiers did not kill\nhim, but put him in bonds, as a traitor, and were about to send him to\nVitellius. When [Antonius] Primus heard of this, he raised up his men immediately,\nand made them put on their armor, and led them against those that had revolted;\nhereupon they put themselves in order of battle, and made a resistance\nfor a while, but were soon beaten, and fled to Cremona; then did Primus\ntake his horsemen, and cut off their entrance into the city, and encompassed\nand destroyed a great multitude of them before the city, and fell into\nthe city together with the rest, and gave leave to his soldiers to plunder\nit. And here it was that many strangers, who were merchants, as well as\nmany of the people of that country, perished, and among them Vitellius's\nwhole army, being thirty thousand and two hundred, while Antonius lost\nno more of those that came with him from Mysia than four thousand and five\nhundred: he then loosed Cecinna, and sent him to Vespasian to tell him\nthe good news.

Accordingly, it so came to pass,\nthat all the places that were about the temple were burnt down, and were\nbecome an intermediate desert space, ready for fighting on both sides of\nit; and that almost all that corn was burnt, which would have been sufficient\nfor a siege of many years.

The aged men and the women were\nin such distress by their internal calamities, that they wished for the\nRomans, and earnestly hoped for an external war, in order to their delivery\nfrom their domestical miseries. The citizens themselves were under a terrible\nconsternation and fear; nor had they any opportunity of taking counsel,\nand of changing their conduct; nor were there any hopes of coming to an\nagreement with their enemies; nor could such as had a mind flee away; for\nguards were set at all places, and the heads of the robbers, although they\nwere seditious one against another in other respects, yet did they agree\nin killing those that were for peace with the Romans, or were suspected\nof an inclination to desert them, as their common enemies. They agreed\nin nothing but this, to kill those that were innocent. The noise also of\nthose that were fighting was incessant, both by day and by night; but the\nlamentations of those that mourned exceeded the other; nor was there ever\nany occasion for them to leave off their lamentations, because their calamities\ncame perpetually one upon another, although the deep consternation they\nwere in prevented their outward wailing; but being constrained by their\nfear to conceal their inward passions, they were inwardly tormented, without\ndaring to open their lips in groans. :Nor was any regard paid to those\nthat were still alive, by their relations; nor was there any care taken\nof burial for those that were dead; the occasion of both which was this,\nthat every one despaired of himself; for those that were not among the\nseditious had no great desires of any thing, as expecting for certain that\nthey should very soon be destroyed; but for the seditious themselves, they\nfought against each other, while they trod upon the dead bodies as they\nlay heaped one upon another, and taking up a mad rage from those dead bodies\nthat were under their feet, became the fiercer thereupon. They, moreover,\nwere still inventing somewhat or other that was pernicious against themselves;\nand when they had resolved upon any thing, they executed it without mercy,\nand omitted no method of torment or of barbarity. Nay, John abused the\nsacred materials, \nand employed them in the construction of his engines of war; for the people\nand the priests had formerly determined to support the temple, and raise\nthe holy house twenty cubits higher; for king Agrippa had at a very great\nexpense, and with very great pains, brought thither such materials as were\nproper for that purpose, being pieces of timber very well worth seeing,\nboth for their straightness and their largeness; but the war coming on,\nand interrupting the work, John had them cut, and prepared for the building\nhim towers, he finding them long enough to oppose from them those his adversaries\nthat thought him from the temple that was above him. He also had them brought\nand erected behind the inner court over against the west end of the cloisters,\nwhere alone he could erect them ; whereas the other sides of that court\nhad so many steps as would not let them come nigh enough the cloisters."}, "Thus did John hope to be too hard for his enemies by these engines\nconstructed by his impiety; but God himself demonstrated that his pains\nwould prove of no use to him, by bringing the Romans upon him, before he\nhad reared any of his towers; for Titus, when he had gotten together part\nof his forces about him, and had ordered the rest to meet him at Jerusalem,\nmarched out of Cesarea. He had with him those three legions that had accompanied\nhis father when he laid Judea waste, together with that twelfth legion\nwhich had been formerly beaten with Cestius; which legion, as it was otherwise\nremarkable for its valor, so did it march on now with greater alacrity\nto avenge themselves on the Jews, as remembering what they had formerly\nsuffered from them. Of these legions he ordered the fifth to meet him,\nby going through Emmaus, and the tenth to go up by Jericho; he also moved\nhimself, together with the rest; besides whom, marched those auxiliaries\nthat came from the kings, being now more in number than before, together\nwith a considerable number that came to his assistance from Syria. Those\nalso that had been selected out of these four legions, and sent with Mucianus\nto Italy, had their places filled up out of these soldiers that came out\nof Egypt with Titus; who were two thousand men, chosen out of the armies\nat Alexandria. There followed him also three thousand drawn from those\nthat guarded the river Euphrates; as also there came Tiberius Alexander,\nwho was a friend of his, most valuable, both for his good-will to him,\nand for his prudence. He had formerly been governor of Alexandria, but\nwas now thought worthy to be general of the army [under Titus]. The reason\nof this was, that he had been the first who encouraged Vespasian very lately\nto accept this his new dominion, and joined himself to him with great fidelity,\nwhen things were uncertain, and fortune had not yet declared for him.

They\nintercepted Titus also, with a few other. Now it was here impossible for\nhim to go forward, because all the places had trenches dug in them from\nthe wall, to preserve the gardens round about, and were full of gardens\nobliquely situated, and of many hedges; and to return back to his own men,\nhe saw it was also impossible, by reason of the multitude of the enemies\nthat lay between them; many of whom did not so much as know that the king\nwas in any danger, but supposed him still among them. So he perceived that\nhis preservation must be wholly owing to his own courage, and turned his\nhorse about, and cried out aloud to those that were about him to follow\nhim, and ran with violence into the midst of his enemies, in order to force\nhis way through them to his own men. And hence we may principally learn,\nthat both the success of wars, and the dangers that kings \nare in, are under the providence of God; for while such a number of darts\nwere thrown at Titus, when he had neither his head-piece on, nor his breastplate,\n(for, as I told you, he went out not to fight, but to view the city,) none\nof them touched his body, but went aside without hurting him; as if all\nof them missed him on purpose, and only made a noise as they passed by\nhim. So he diverted those perpetually with his sword that came on his side,\nand overturned many of those that directly met him, and made his horse\nride over those that were overthrown. The enemy indeed made a shout at\nthe boldness of Caesar, and exhorted one another to rush upon him. Yet\ndid these against whom he marched fly away, and go off from him in great\nnumbers; while those that were in the same danger with him kept up close\nto him, though they were wounded both on their backs and on their sides;\nfor they had each of them but this one hope of escaping, if they could\nassist Titus in opening himself a way, that he might not be encompassed\nround by his enemies before he got away from them. Now there were two of\nthose that were with him, but at some distance; the one of which the enemy\ncompassed round, and slew him with their darts, and his horse also; but\nthe other they slew as he leaped down from his horse, and carried off his\nhorse with them. But Titus escaped with the rest, and came safe to the\ncamp. So this success of the Jews' first attack raised their minds, and\ngave them an ill-grounded hope; and this short inclination of fortune,\non their side, made them very courageous for the future."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This situation\nof the Mount of Olives, on the east of Jerusalem, at about the distance\nof five or six furlongs, with the valley of Cedron interposed between that\nmountain and the city, are things well known both in the Old and New Testament,\nin Josephus elsewhere, and in all the descriptions of Palestine."}, "#text": "But now, as soon as that legion that had been at Emmaus was joined\nto Caesar at night, he removed thence, when it was day, and came to a place\ncalled Seopus; from whence the city began already to be seen, and a plain\nview might be taken of the great temple. Accordingly, this place, on the\nnorth quarter of the city, and joining thereto, was a plain, and very properly\nnamed Scopus, [the prospect,] and was no more than seven furlongs distant\nfrom it. And here it was that Titus ordered a camp to be fortified for\ntwo legions that were to be together; but ordered another camp to be fortified,\nat three furlongs farther distance behind them, for the fifth legion; for\nhe thought that, by marching in the night, they might be tired, and might\ndeserve to be covered from the enemy, and with less fear might fortify\nthemselves; and as these were now beginning to build, the tenth legion,\nwho came through Jericho, was already come to the place, where a certain\nparty of armed men had formerly lain, to guard that pass into the city,\nand had been taken before by Vespasian. These legions had orders to encamp\nat the distance of six furlongs from Jerusalem, at the mount called the\nMount of Olives \nwhich lies over against the city on the east side, and is parted from it\nby a deep valley, interposed between them, which is named Cedron."}, "Now when hitherto the several parties in the city had been dashing\none against another perpetually, this foreign war, now suddenly come upon\nthem after a violent manner, put the first stop to their contentions one\nagainst another; and as the seditious now saw with astonishment the Romans\npitching three several camps, they began to think of an awkward sort of\nconcord, and said one to another, \"What do we here, and what do we\nmean, when we suffer three fortified walls to be built to coop us in, that\nwe shall not be able to breathe freely? while the enemy is securely building\na kind of city in opposition to us, and while we sit still within our own\nwalls, and become spectators only of what they are doing, with our hands\nidle, and our armor laid by, as if they were about somewhat that was for\nour good and advantage. We are, it seems, (so did they cry out,) only courageous\nagainst ourselves, while the Romans are likely to gain the city without\nbloodshed by our sedition.\" Thus did they encourage one another when\nthey were gotten together, and took their armor immediately, and ran out\nupon the tenth legion, and fell upon the Romans with great eagerness, and\nwith a prodigious shout, as they were fortifying their camp. These Romans\nwere caught in different parties, and this in order to perform their several\nworks, and on that account had in great measure laid aside their arms;\nfor they thought the Jews would not have ventured to make a sally upon\nthem; and had they been disposed so to do, they supposed their sedition\nwould have distracted them. So they were put into disorder unexpectedly;\nwhen some of hem left their works they were about, and immediately marched\noff, while many ran to their arms, but were smitten and slain before they\ncould turn back upon the enemy. The Jews became still more and more in\nnumber, as encouraged by the good success of those that first made the\nattack; and while they had such good fortune, they seemed both to themselves\nand to the enemy to be many more than they really were. The disorderly\nway of their fighting at first put the Romans also to a stand, who had\nbeen constantly used to fight skillfully in good order, and with keeping\ntheir ranks, and obeying the orders that were given them; for which reason\nthe Romans were caught unexpectedly, and were obliged to give way to the\nassaults that were made upon them. Now when these Romans were overtaken,\nand turned back upon the Jews, they put a stop to their career; yet when\nthey did not take care enough of themselves through the vehemency of their\npursuit, they were wounded by them; but as still more and more Jews sallied\nout of the city, the Romans were at length brought into confusion, and\nput to fight, and ran away from their camp. Nay, things looked as though\nthe entire legion would have been in danger, unless Titus had been informed\nof the case they were in, and had sent them succors immediately. So he\nreproached them for their cowardice, and brought those back that were running\naway, and fell himself upon the Jews on their flank, with those select\ntroops that were with him, and slew a considerable number, and wounded\nmore of them, and put them all to flight, and made them run away hastily\ndown the valley. Now as these Jews suffered greatly in the declivity of\nthe valley, so when they were gotten over it, they turned about, and stood\nover against the Romans, having the valley between them, and there fought\nwith them. Thus did they continue the fight till noon; but when it was\nalready a little after noon, Titus set those that came to the assistance\nof the Romans with him, and those that belonged to the cohorts, to prevent\nthe Jews from making any more sallies, and then sent the rest of the legion\nto the upper part of the mountain, to fortify their camp.", "This march of the Romans seemed to the Jews to be a flight; and as\nthe watchman who was placed upon the wall gave a signal by shaking his\ngarment, there came out a fresh multitude of Jews, and that with such mighty\nviolence, that one might compare it to the running of the most terrible\nwild beasts. To say the truth, none of those that opposed them could sustain\nthe fury with which they made their attacks; but, as if they had been cast\nout of an engine, they brake the enemies' ranks to pieces, who were put\nto flight, and ran away to the mountain; none but Titus himself, and a\nfew others with him, being left in the midst of the acclivity. Now these\nothers, who were his friends, despised the danger they were in, and were\nashamed to leave their general, earnestly exhorting him to give way to\nthese Jews that are fond of dying, and not to run into such dangers before\nthose that ought to stay before him; to consider what his fortune was,\nand not, by supplying the place of a common soldier, to venture to turn\nback upon the enemy so suddenly; and this because he was general in the\nwar, and lord of the habitable earth, on whose preservation the public\naffairs do all depend. These persuasions Titus seemed not so much as to\nhear, but opposed those that ran upon him, and smote them on the face;\nand when he had forced them to go back, he slew them: he also fell upon\ngreat numbers as they marched down the hill, and thrust them forward; while\nthose men were so amazed at his courage and his strength, that they could\nnot fly directly to the city, but declined from him on both sides, and\npressed after those that fled up the hill; yet did he still fall upon their\nflank, and put a stop to their fury. In the mean time, a disorder and a\nterror fell again upon those that were fortifying their camp at the top\nof the hill, upon their seeing those beneath them running away; insomuch\nthat the whole legion was dispersed, while they thought that the sallies\nof the Jews upon them were plainly insupportable, and that Titus was himself\nput to flight; because they took it for granted, that, if he had staid,\nthe rest would never have fled for it. Thus were they encompassed on every\nside by a kind of panic fear, and some dispersed themselves one way, and\nsome another, till certain of them saw their general in the very midst\nof an action, and being under great concern for him, they loudly proclaimed\nthe danger he was in to the entire legion; and now shame made them turn\nback, and they reproached one another that they did worse than run away,\nby deserting Caesar. So they used their utmost force against the Jews,\nand declining from the straight declivity, they drove them on heaps into\nthe bottom of the valley. Then did the Jews turn about and fight them;\nbut as they were themselves retiring, and now, because the Romans had the\nadvantage of the ground, and were above the Jews, they drove them all into\nthe valley. Titus also pressed upon those that were near him, and sent\nthe legion again to fortify their camp; while he, and those that were with\nhim before, opposed the enemy, and kept them from doing further mischief;\ninsomuch that, if I may be allowed neither to add any thing out of flattery,\nnor to diminish any thing out of envy, but to speak the plain truth, Caesar\ndid twice deliver that entire legion when it was in jeopardy, and gave\nthem a quiet opportunity of fortifying their camp.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Here we see\nthe true occasion of those vast numbers of Jews that were in Jerusalem\nduring this siege by Titus, and perished therein; that the siege began\nat the feast of the passover, when such prodigious multitudes of Jews and\nproselytes of the gate were come from all parts of Judea, and from other\ncountries, in order to celebrate that great festival. See the note B. VI.\nch. 9. sect. 3. Tacitus himself informs us, that the number of men, women,\nand children in Jerusalem, when it was besieged by the Romans, as he had\nbeen informed. This information must have been taken from the Romans: for\nJosephus never recounts the numbers of those that were besieged, only he\nlets us know, that of the vulgar, carried dead out of the gates, and buried\nat the public charges, was the like number of 600,000, ch. viii. sect.\n7. However, when Cestius Gallus came first to the siege, that sum in Tacitus\nis no way disagreeable to Josephus's history, though they were become much\nmore numerous when Titus encompassed the city at the passover. As to the\nnumber that perished during this siege, Josephus assures us, as we shall\nsee hereafter, they were 1,100,000, besides 97,000 captives. But Tacitus's\nhistory of the last part of this siege is not now extant; so we cannot\ncompare his parallel numbers with those of Josephus."}, "#text": "AS now the war abroad ceased for a while, the sedition within was\nrevived; and on the feast of unleavened bread, which was now come, it being\nthe fourteenth day of the month Xanthicus, [Nisan,] when it is believed\nthe Jews were first freed from the Egyptians, Eleazar and his party opened\nthe gates of this [inmost court of the] temple, and admitted such of the\npeople as were desirous to worship God into it. \nBut John made use of this festival as a cloak for his treacherous designs,\nand armed the most inconsiderable of his own party, the greater part of\nwhom were not purified, with weapons concealed under their garments, and\nsent them with great zeal into the temple, in order to seize upon it; which\narmed men, when they were gotten in, threw their garments away, and presently\nappeared in their armor. Upon which there was a very great disorder and\ndisturbance about the holy house; while the people, who had no concern\nin the sedition, supposed that this assault was made against all without\ndistinction, as the zealots thought it was made against themselves only.\nSo these left off guarding the gates any longer, and leaped down from their\nbattlements before they came to an engagement, and fled away into the subterranean\ncaverns of the temple; while the people that stood trembling at the altar,\nand about the holy house, were rolled on heaps together, and trampled upon,\nand were beaten both with wooden and with iron weapons without mercy. Such\nalso as had differences with others slew many persons that were quiet,\nout of their own private enmity and hatred, as if they were opposite to\nthe seditious; and all those that had formerly offended any of these plotters\nwere now known, and were now led away to the slaughter; and when they had\ndone abundance of horrid mischief to the guiltless, they granted a truce\nto the guilty, and let those go off that came cut of the caverns. These\nfollowers of John also did now seize upon this inner temple, and upon all\nthe warlike engines therein, and then ventured to oppose Simon. And thus\nthat sedition, which had been divided into three factions, was now reduced\nto two."}, "But Titus, intending to pitch his camp nearer to the city than Scopus,\nplaced as many of his choice horsemen and footmen as he thought sufficient\nopposite to the Jews, to prevent their sallying out upon them, while he\ngave orders for the whole army to level the distance, as far as the wall\nof the city. So they threw down all the hedges and walls which the inhabitants\nhad made about their gardens and groves of trees, and cut down all the\nfruit trees that lay between them and the wall of the city, and filled\nup all the hollow places and the chasms, and demolished the rocky precipices\nwith iron instruments; and thereby made all the place level from Scopus\nto Herod's monuments, which adjoined to the pool called the Serpent's Pool.", "Now at this very time the Jews contrived the following stratagem\nagainst the Romans. The bolder sort of the seditious went out at the towers,\ncalled the Women's Towers, as if they had been ejected out of the city\nby those who were for peace, and rambled about as if they were afraid of\nbeing assaulted by the Romans, and were in fear of one another; while those\nthat stood upon the wall, and seemed to be of the people's side, cried\nout aloud for peace, and entreated they might have security for their lives\ngiven them, and called for the Romans, promising to open the gates to them;\nand as they cried out after that manner, they threw stones at their own\npeople, as though they would drive them away from the gates. These also\npretended that they were excluded by force, and that they petitioned those\nthat were within to let them in; and rushing upon the Romans perpetually,\nwith violence, they then came back, and seemed to be in great disorder.\nNow the Roman soldiers thought this cunning stratagem of theirs was to\nbe believed real, and thinking they had the one party under their power,\nand could punish them as they pleased, and hoping that the other party\nwould open their gates to them, set to the execution of their designs accordingly.\nBut for Titus himself, he had this surprising conduct of the Jews in suspicion;\nfor whereas he had invited them to come to terms of accommodation, by Josephus,\nbut one day before, he could then receive no civil answer from them; so\nhe ordered the soldiers to stay where they were. However, some of them\nthat were set in the front of the works prevented him, and catching up\ntheir arms ran to the gates; whereupon those that seemed to have been ejected\nat the first retired; but as soon as the soldiers were gotten between the\ntowers on each side of the gate, the Jews ran out and encompassed them\nround, and fell upon them behind, while that multitude which stood upon\nthe wall threw a heap of stones and darts of all kinds at them, insomuch\nthat they slew a considerable number, and wounded many more; for it was\nnot easy for the Romans to escape, by reason those behind them pressed\nthem forward; besides which, the shame they were under for being mistaken,\nand the fear they were in of their commanders, engaged them to persevere\nin their mistake; wherefore they fought with their spears a great while,\nand received many blows from the Jews, though indeed they gave them as\nmany blows again, and at last repelled those that had encompassed them\nabout, while the Jews pursued them as they retired, and followed them,\nand threw darts at them as far as the monuments of queen Helena.", "After this these Jews, without keeping any decorum, grew insolent\nupon their good fortune, and jested upon the Romans for being deluded by\nthe trick they bad put upon them, and making a noise with beating their\nshields, leaped for gladness, and made joyful exclamations; while these\nsoldiers were received with threatenings by their officers, and with indignation\nby Caesar himself, [who spake to them thus]: These Jews, who are only conducted\nby their madness, do every thing with care and circumspection; they contrive\nstratagems, and lay ambushes, and fortune gives success to their stratagems,\nbecause they are obedient, and preserve their goodwill and fidelity to\none another; while the Romans, to whom fortune uses to be ever subservient,\nby reason of their good order, and ready submission to their commanders,\nhave now had ill success by their contrary behavior, and by not being able\nto restrain their hands from action, they have been caught; and that which\nis the most to their reproach, they have gone on without their commanders,\nin the very presence of Caesar. \"Truly,\" says Titus, \"the\nlaws of war cannot but groan heavily, as will my father also himself, when\nhe shall be informed of this wound that hath been given us, since he who\nis grown old in wars did never make so great a mistake. Our laws of war\ndo also ever inflict capital punishment on those that in the least break\ninto good order, while at this time they have seen an entire army run into\ndisorder. However, those that have been so insolent shall be made immediately\nsensible, that even they who conquer among the Romans without orders for\nfighting are to be under disgrace.\" When Titus had enlarged upon this\nmatter before the commanders, it appeared evident that he would execute\nthe law against all those that were concerned; so these soldiers' minds\nsunk down in despair, as expecting to be put to death, and that justly\nand quickly. However, the other legions came round about Titus, and entreated\nhis favor to these their fellow soldiers, and made supplication to him,\nthat he would pardon the rashness of a few, on account of the better obedience\nof all the rest; and promised for them that they should make amends for\ntheir present fault, by their more virtuous behavior for the time to come.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Perhaps,\nsays Dr. Hudson, here was that gate, called the \"Gate of the Corner,\"\nin 2 Chronicles 26:9.

And now when the\nspace between the Romans and the wall had been leveled, which was done\nin four days, and as he was desirous to bring the baggage of the army,\nwith the rest of the multitude that followed him, safely to the camp, he\nset the strongest part of his army over against that wall which lay on\nthe north quarter of the city, and over against the western part of it,\nand made his army seven deep, with the foot-men placed before them, and\nthe horsemen behind them, each of the last in three ranks, whilst the archers\nstood in the midst in seven ranks. And now as the Jews were prohibited,\nby so great a body of men, from making sallies upon the Romans, both the\nbeasts that bare the burdens, and belonged to the three legions, and the\nrest of the multitude, marched on without any fear.

However, the tenth legion continued in its own place, upon\nthe Mount of Olives."}, "THE city of Jerusalem was fortified with three walls, on such parts\nas were not encompassed with unpassable valleys; for in such places it\nhad but one wall. The city was built upon two hills, which are opposite\nto one another, and have a valley to divide them asunder; at which valley\nthe corresponding rows of houses on both hills end. Of these hills, that\nwhich contains the upper city is much higher, and in length more direct.\nAccordingly, it was called the \"Citadel,\" by king David; he was\nthe father of that Solomon who built this temple at the first; but it is\nby us called the \"Upper Market-place.\" But the other hill, which\nwas called \"Acra,\" and sustains the lower city, is of the shape\nof a moon when she is horned; over against this there was a third hill,\nbut naturally lower than Acra, and parted formerly from the other by a\nbroad valley. However, in those times when the Asamoneans reigned, they\nfilled up that valley with earth, and had a mind to join the city to the\ntemple. They then took off part of the height of Acra, and reduced it to\nbe of less elevation than it was before, that the temple might be superior\nto it. Now the Valley of the Cheesemongers, as it was called, and was that\nwhich we told you before distinguished the hill of the upper city from\nthat of the lower, extended as far as Siloam; for that is the name of a\nfountain which hath sweet water in it, and this in great plenty also. But\non the outsides, these hills are surrounded by deep valleys, and by reason\nof the precipices to them belonging on both sides they are every where\nunpassable.", "Now, of these three walls, the old one was hard to be taken, both\nby reason of the valleys, and of that hill on which it was built, and which\nwas above them. But besides that great advantage, as to the place where\nthey were situated, it was also built very strong; because David and Solomon,\nand the following kings, were very zealous about this work. Now that wall\nbegan on the north, at the tower called \"Hippicus,\" and extended\nas far as the \"Xistus,\" a place so called, and then, joining\nto the council-house, ended at the west cloister of the temple. But if\nwe go the other way westward, it began at the same place, and extended\nthrough a place called \"Bethso,\" to the gate of the Essens; and\nafter that it went southward, having its bending above the fountain Siloam,\nwhere it also bends again towards the east at Solomon's pool, and reaches\nas far as a certain place which they called \"Ophlas,\" where it\nwas joined to the eastern cloister of the temple. The second wall took\nits beginning from that gate which they called \"Gennath,\" which\nbelonged to the first wall; it only encompassed the northern quarter of\nthe city, and reached as far as the tower Antonia. The beginning of the\nthird wall was at the tower Hippicus, whence it reached as far as the north\nquarter of the city, and the tower Psephinus, and then was so far extended\ntill it came over against the monuments of Helena, which Helena was queen\nof Adiabene, the daughter of Izates; it then extended further to a great\nlength, and passed by the sepulchral caverns of the kings, and bent again\nat the tower of the corner, at the monument which is called the \"Monument\nof the Fuller,\" and joined to the old wall at the valley called the\n\"Valley of Cedron.\" It was Agrippa who encompassed the parts\nadded to the old city with this wall, which had been all naked before;\nfor as the city grew more populous, it gradually crept beyond its old limits,\nand those parts of it that stood northward of the temple, and joined that\nhill to the city, made it considerably larger, and occasioned that hill,\nwhich is in number the fourth, and is called \"Bezetha,\" to be\ninhabited also. It lies over against the tower Antonia, but is divided\nfrom it by a deep valley, which was dug on purpose, and that in order to\nhinder the foundations of the tower of Antonia from joining to this hill,\nand thereby affording an opportunity for getting to it with ease, and hindering\nthe security that arose from its superior elevation; for which reason also\nthat depth of the ditch made the elevation of the towers more remarkable.\nThis new-built part of the city was called \"Bezetha,\" in our\nlanguage, which, if interpreted in the Grecian language, may be called\n\"the New City.\" Since, therefore, its inhabitants stood in need\nof a covering, the father of the present king, and of the same name with\nhim, Agrippa, began that wall we spoke of; but he left off building it\nwhen he had only laid the foundations, out of the fear he was in of Claudius\nCaesar, lest he should suspect that so strong a wall was built in order\nto make some innovation in public affairs; for the city could no way have\nbeen taken if that wall had been finished in the manner it was begun; as\nits parts were connected together by stones twenty cubits long, and ten\ncubits broad, which could never have been either easily undermined by any\niron tools, or shaken by any engines. The wall was, however, ten cubits\nwide, and it would probably have had a height greater than that, had not\nhis zeal who began it been hindered from exerting itself. After this, it\nwas erected with great diligence by the Jews, as high as twenty cubits,\nabove which it had battlements of two cubits, and turrets of three cubits\naltitude, insomuch that the entire altitude extended as far as twenty-five\ncubits.", "Now the towers that were upon it were twenty cubits in breadth, and\ntwenty cubits in height; they were square and solid, as was the wall itself,\nwherein the niceness of the joints, and the beauty of the stones, were\nno way inferior to those of the holy house itself. Above this solid altitude\nof the towers, which was twenty cubits, there were rooms of great magnificence,\nand over them upper rooms, and cisterns to receive rain-water. They were\nmany in number, and the steps by which you ascended up to them were every\none broad: of these towers then the third wall had ninety, and the spaces\nbetween them were each two hundred cubits; but in the middle wall were\nforty towers, and the old wall was parted into sixty, while the whole compass\nof the city was thirty-three furlongs. Now the third wall was all of it\nwonderful; yet was the tower Psephinus elevated above it at the north-west\ncorner, and there Titus pitched his own tent; for being seventy cubits\nhigh it both afforded a prospect of Arabia at sun-rising, as well as it\ndid of the utmost limits of the Hebrew possessions at the sea westward.\nMoreover, it was an octagon, and over against it was the tower Hipplicus,\nand hard by two others were erected by king Herod, in the old wall. These\nwere for largeness, beauty, and strength beyond all that were in the habitable\nearth; for besides the magnanimity of his nature, and his magnificence\ntowards the city on other occasions, he built these after such an extraordinary\nmanner, to gratify his own private affections, and dedicated these towers\nto the memory of those three persons who had been the dearest to him, and\nfrom whom he named them. They were his brother, his friend, and his wife.\nThis wife he had slain, out of his love [and jealousy], as we have already\nrelated; the other two he lost in war, as they were courageously fighting.\nHippicus, so named from his friend, was square; its length and breadth\nwere each twenty-five cubits, and its height thirty, and it had no vacuity\nin it. Over this solid building, which was composed of great stones united\ntogether, there was a reservoir twenty cubits deep, over which there was\na house of two stories, whose height was twenty-five cubits, and divided\ninto several parts; over which were battlements of two cubits, and turrets\nall round of three cubits high, insomuch that the entire height added together\namounted to fourscore cubits. The second tower, which he named from his\nbrother Phasaelus, had its breadth and its height equal, each of them forty\ncubits; over which was its solid height of forty cubits; over which a cloister\nwent round about, whose height was ten cubits, and it was covered from\nenemies by breast-works and bulwarks. There was also built over that cloister\nanother tower, parted into magnificent rooms, and a place for bathing;\nso that this tower wanted nothing that might make it appear to be a royal\npalace. It was also adorned with battlements and turrets, more than was\nthe foregoing, and the entire altitude was about ninety cubits; the appearance\nof it resembled the tower of Pharus, which exhibited a fire to such as\nsailed to Alexandria, but was much larger than it in compass. This was\nnow converted to a house, wherein Simon exercised his tyrannical authority.\nThe third tower was Mariamne, for that was his queen's name; it was solid\nas high as twenty cubits; its breadth and its length were twenty cubits,\nand were equal to each other; its upper buildings were more magnificent,\nand had greater variety, than the other towers had; for the king thought\nit most proper for him to adorn that which was denominated from his wife,\nbetter than those denominated from men, as those were built stronger than\nthis that bore his wife's name. The entire height of this tower was fifty\ncubits.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "These\ndove-courts in Josephus, built by Herod the Great, are, in the opinion\nof Reland, the very same that are mentioned by the Talmudists, and named\nby them \"Herod's dove courts.\" Nor is there any reason to suppose\notherwise, since in both accounts they were expressly tame pigeons which\nwere kept in them."}, "#text": "Now as these towers were so very tall, they appeared much taller\nby the place on which they stood; for that very old wall wherein they were\nwas built on a high hill, and was itself a kind of elevation that was still\nthirty cubits taller; over which were the towers situated, and thereby\nwere made much higher to appearance. The largeness also of the stones was\nwonderful; for they were not made of common small stones, nor of such large\nones only as men could carry, but they were of white marble, cut out of\nthe rock; each stone was twenty cubits in length, and ten in breadth, and\nfive in depth. They were so exactly united to one another, that each tower\nlooked like one entire rock of stone, so growing naturally, and afterward\ncut by the hand of the artificers into their present shape and corners;\nso little, or not at all, did their joints or connexion appear. low as\nthese towers were themselves on the north side of the wall, the king had\na palace inwardly thereto adjoined, which exceeds all my ability to describe\nit; for it was so very curious as to want no cost nor skill in its construction,\nbut was entirely walled about to the height of thirty cubits, and was adorned\nwith towers at equal distances, and with large bed-chambers, that would\ncontain beds for a hundred guests a-piece, in which the variety of the\nstones is not to be expressed; for a large quantity of those that were\nrare of that kind was collected together. Their roofs were also wonderful,\nboth for the length of the beams, and the splendor of their ornaments.\nThe number of the rooms was also very great, and the variety of the figures\nthat were about them was prodigious; their furniture was complete, and\nthe greatest part of the vessels that were put in them was of silver and\ngold. There were besides many porticoes, one beyond another, round about,\nand in each of those porticoes curious pillars; yet were all the courts\nthat were exposed to the air every where green. There were, moreover, several\ngroves of trees, and long walks through them, with deep canals, and cisterns,\nthat in several parts were filled with brazen statues, through which the\nwater ran out. There were withal many dove-courts \nof tame pigeons about the canals. But indeed it is not possible to give\na complete description of these palaces; and the very remembrance of them\nis a torment to one, as putting one in mind what vastly rich buildings\nthat fire which was kindled by the robbers hath consumed; for these were\nnot burnt by the Romans, but by these internal plotters, as we have already\nrelated, in the beginning of their rebellion. That fire began at the tower\nof Antonia, and went on to the palaces, and consumed the upper parts of\nthe three towers themselves."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "See the\ndescription of the temples hereto belonging, ch. 15.

All that is or can be true here is this, that when the court\nof the Gentiles was long afterward to be encompassed with cloisters, the\nsouthern foundation for these cloisters was found not to be large or firm\nenough, and was raised, and that additional foundation supported by great\npillars and arches under ground, which Josephus speaks of elsewhere, Antiq.\nB. XV. ch. 11. sect. 3, and which Mr. Maundrel saw, and describes, p. 100,\nas extant under ground at this day."}, "#text": "NOW this temple, as I have already said, was built upon a strong\nhill. At first the plain at the top was hardly sufficient for the holy\nhouse and the altar, for the ground about it was very uneven, and like\na precipice; but when king Solomon, who was the person that built the temple,\nhad built a wall to it on its east side, there was then added one cloister\nfounded on a bank cast up for it, and on the other parts the holy house\nstood naked. But in future ages the people added new banks, \nand the hill became a larger plain. They then broke down the wall on the\nnorth side, and took in as much as sufficed afterward for the compass of\nthe entire temple. And when they had built walls on three sides of the\ntemple round about, from the bottom of the hill, and had performed a work\nthat was greater than could be hoped for, (in which work long ages were\nspent by them, as well as all their sacred treasures were exhausted, which\nwere still replenished by those tributes which were sent to God from the\nwhole habitable earth,) they then encompassed their upper courts with cloisters,\nas well as they [afterward] did the lowest [court of the] temple. The lowest\npart of this was erected to the height of three hundred cubits, and in\nsome places more; yet did not the entire depth of the foundations appear,\nfor they brought earth, and filled up the valleys, as being desirous to\nmake them on a level with the narrow streets of the city; wherein they\nmade use of stones of forty cubits in magnitude; for the great plenty of\nmoney they then had, and the liberality of the people, made this attempt\nof theirs to succeed to an incredible degree; and what could not be so\nmuch as hoped for as ever to be accomplished, was, by perseverance and\nlength of time, brought to perfection."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "What Josephus\nseems here to mean is this: that these pillars, supporting the cloisters\nin the second court, had their foundations or lowest parts as deep as the\nfloor of the first or lowest court; but that so far of those lowest parts\nas were equal to the elevation of the upper floor above the lowest were,\nand must be, hidden on the inside by the ground or rock itself, on which\nthat upper court was built; so that forty cubits visible below were reduced\nto twenty-five visible above, and implies the difference of their heights\nto be fifteen cubits. The main difficulty lies here, how fourteen or fifteen\nsteps should give an ascent of fifteen cubits, half a cubit seeming sufficient\nfor a single step. Possibly there were fourteen or fifteen steps at the\npartition wall, and fourteen or fifteen more thence into the court itself,\nwhich would bring the whole near to the just proportion. See sect. 3, infra.\nBut I determine nothing."}, "#text": "Now for the works that were above these foundations, these were not\nunworthy of such foundations; for all the cloisters were double, and the\npillars to them belonging were twenty-five cubits in height, and supported\nthe cloisters. These pillars were of one entire stone each of them, and\nthat stone was white marble; and the roofs were adorned with cedar, curiously\ngraven. The natural magnificence, and excellent polish, and the harmony\nof the joints in these cloisters, afforded a prospect that was very remarkable;\nnor was it on the outside adorned with any work of the painter or engraver.\nThe cloisters [of the outmost court] were in breadth thirty cubits, while\nthe entire compass of it was by measure six furlongs, including the tower\nof Antonia; those entire courts that were exposed to the air were laid\nwith stones of all sorts. When you go through these [first] cloisters,\nunto the second [court of the] temple, there was a partition made of stone\nall round, whose height was three cubits: its construction was very elegant;\nupon it stood pillars, at equal distances from one another, declaring the\nlaw of purity, some in Greek, and some in Roman letters, that \"no\nforeigner should go within that sanctuary\" for that second [court\nof the] temple was called \"the Sanctuary,\" and was ascended to\nby fourteen steps from the first court. This court was four-square, and\nhad a wall about it peculiar to itself; the height of its buildings, although\nit were on the outside forty cubits, \nwas hidden by the steps, and on the inside that height was but twenty-five\ncubits; for it being built over against a higher part of the hill with\nsteps, it was no further to be entirely discerned within, being covered\nby the hill itself. Beyond these thirteen steps there was the distance\nof ten cubits; this was all plain; whence there were other steps, each\nof five cubits a-piece, that led to the gates, which gates on the north\nand south sides were eight, on each of those sides four, and of necessity\ntwo on the east. For since there was a partition built for the women on\nthat side, as the proper place wherein they were to worship, there was\na necessity for a second gate for them: this gate was cut out of its wall,\nover against the first gate. There was also on the other sides one southern\nand one northern gate, through which was a passage into the court of the\nwomen; for as to the other gates, the women were not allowed to pass through\nthem; nor when they went through their own gate could they go beyond their\nown wall. This place was allotted to the women of our own country, and\nof other countries, provided they were of the same nation, and that equally.\nThe western part of this court had no gate at all, but the wall was built\nentire on that side. But then the cloisters which were betwixt the gates\nextended from the wall inward, before the chambers; for they were supported\nby very fine and large pillars. These cloisters were single, and, excepting\ntheir magnitude, were no way inferior to those of the lower court."}, "Now nine of these gates were on every side covered over with gold\nand silver, as were the jambs of their doors and their lintels; but there\nwas one gate that was without the [inward court of the] holy house, which\nwas of Corinthian brass, and greatly excelled those that were only covered\nover with silver and gold. Each gate had two doors, whose height was severally\nthirty cubits, and their breadth fifteen. However, they had large spaces\nwithin of thirty cubits, and had on each side rooms, and those, both in\nbreadth and in length, built like towers, and their height was above forty\ncubits. Two pillars did also support these rooms, and were in circumference\ntwelve cubits. Now the magnitudes of the other gates were equal one to\nanother; but that over the Corinthian gate, which opened on the east over\nagainst the gate of the holy house itself, was much larger; for its height\nwas fifty cubits; and its doors were forty cubits; and it was adorned after\na most costly manner, as having much richer and thicker plates of silver\nand gold upon them than the other. These nine gates had that silver and\ngold poured upon them by Alexander, the father of Tiberius. Now there were\nfifteen steps, which led away from the wall of the court of the women to\nthis greater gate; whereas those that led thither from the other gates\nwere five steps shorter.", "As to the holy house itself, which was placed in the midst [of the\ninmost court], that most sacred part of the temple, it was ascended to\nby twelve steps; and in front its height and its breadth were equal, and\neach a hundred cubits, though it was behind forty cubits narrower; for\non its front it had what may be styled shoulders on each side, that passed\ntwenty cubits further. Its first gate was seventy cubits high, and twenty-five\ncubits broad; but this gate had no doors; for it represented the universal\nvisibility of heaven, and that it cannot be excluded from any place. Its\nfront was covered with gold all over, and through it the first part of\nthe house, that was more inward, did all of it appear; which, as it was\nvery large, so did all the parts about the more inward gate appear to shine\nto those that saw them; but then, as the entire house was divided into\ntwo parts within, it was only the first part of it that was open to our\nview. Its height extended all along to ninety cubits in height, and its\nlength was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty. But that gate which was\nat this end of the first part of the house was, as we have already observed,\nall over covered with gold, as was its whole wall about it; it had also\ngolden vines above it, from which clusters of grapes hung as tall as a\nman's height. But then this house, as it was divided into two parts, the\ninner part was lower than the appearance of the outer, and had golden doors\nof fifty-five cubits altitude, and sixteen in breadth; but before these\ndoors there was a veil of equal largeness with the doors. It was a Babylonian\ncurtain, embroidered with blue, and fine linen, and scarlet, and purple,\nand of a contexture that was truly wonderful. Nor was this mixture of colors\nwithout its mystical interpretation, but was a kind of image of the universe;\nfor by the scarlet there seemed to be enigmatically signified fire, by\nthe fine flax the earth, by the blue the air, and by the purple the sea;\ntwo of them having their colors the foundation of this resemblance; but\nthe fine flax and the purple have their own origin for that foundation,\nthe earth producing the one, and the sea the other. This curtain had also\nembroidered upon it all that was mystical in the heavens, excepting that\nof the [twelve] signs, representing living creatures.", "When any persons entered into the temple, its floor received them.\nThis part of the temple therefore was in height sixty cubits, and its length\nthe same; whereas its breadth was but twenty cubits: but still that sixty\ncubits in length was divided again, and the first part of it was cut off\nat forty cubits, and had in it three things that were very wonderful and\nfamous among all mankind, the candlestick, the table [of shew-bread], and\nthe altar of incense. Now the seven lamps signified the seven planets;\nfor so many there were springing out of the candlestick. Now the twelve\nloaves that were upon the table signified the circle of the zodiac and\nthe year; but the altar of incense, by its thirteen kinds of sweet-smelling\nspices with which the sea replenished it, signified that God is the possessor\nof all things that are both in the uninhabitable and habitable parts of\nthe earth, and that they are all to be dedicated to his use. But the inmost\npart of the temple of all was of twenty cubits. This was also separated\nfrom the outer part by a veil. In this there was nothing at all. It was\ninaccessible and inviolable, and not to be seen by any; and was called\nthe Holy of Holies. Now, about the sides of the lower part of the temple,\nthere were little houses, with passages out of one into another; there\nwere a great many of them, and they were of three stories high; there were\nalso entrances on each side into them from the gate of the temple. But\nthe superior part of the temple had no such little houses any further,\nbecause the temple was there narrower, and forty cubits higher, and of\na smaller body than the lower parts of it. Thus we collect that the whole\nheight, including the sixty cubits from the floor, amounted to a hundred\ncubits.", "Now the outward face of the temple in its front wanted nothing that\nwas likely to surprise either men's minds or their eyes; for it was covered\nall over with plates of gold of great weight, and, at the first rising\nof the sun, reflected back a very fiery splendor, and made those who forced\nthemselves to look upon it to turn their eyes away, just as they would\nhave done at the sun's own rays. But this temple appeared to strangers,\nwhen they were coming to it at a distance, like a mountain covered with\nsnow; for as to those parts of it that were not gilt, they were exceeding\nwhite. On its top it had spikes with sharp points, to prevent any pollution\nof it by birds sitting upon it. Of its stones, some of them were forty-five\ncubits in length, five in height, and six in breadth. Before this temple\nstood the altar, fifteen cubits high, and equal both in length and breadth;\neach of which dimensions was fifty cubits. The figure it was built in was\na square, and it had corners like horns; and the passage up to it was by\nan insensible acclivity. It was formed without any iron tool, nor did any\nsuch iron tool so much as touch it at any time. There was also a wall of\npartition, about a cubit in height, made of fine stones, and so as to be\ngrateful to the sight; this encompassed the holy house and the altar, and\nkept the people that were on the outside off from the priests. Moreover,\nthose that had the gonorrhea and the leprosy were excluded out of the city\nentirely; women also, when their courses were upon them, were shut out\nof the temple; nor when they were free from that impurity, were they allowed\nto go beyond the limit before-mentioned; men also, that were not thoroughly\npure, were prohibited to come into the inner [court of the] temple; nay,\nthe priests themselves that were not pure were prohibited to come into\nit also.", "Now all those of the stock of the priests that could not minister\nby reason of some defect in their bodies, came within the partition, together\nwith those that had no such imperfection, and had their share with them\nby reason of their stock, but still made use of none except their own private\ngarments; for nobody but he that officiated had on his sacred garments;\nbut then those priests that were without any blemish upon them went up\nto the altar clothed in fine linen. They abstained chiefly from wine, out\nof this fear, lest otherwise they should transgress some rules of their\nministration. The high priest did also go up with them; not always indeed,\nbut on the seventh days and new moons, and if any festivals belonging to\nour nation, which we celebrate every year, happened. When he officiated,\nhe had on a pair of breeches that reached beneath his privy parts to his\nthighs, and had on an inner garment of linen, together with a blue garment,\nround, without seam, with fringe work, and reaching to the feet. There\nwere also golden bells that hung upon the fringes, and pomegranates intermixed\namong them. The bells signified thunder, and the pomegranates lightning.\nBut that girdle that tied the garment to the breast was embroidered with\nfive rows of various colors, of gold, and purple, and scarlet, as also\nof fine linen and blue, with which colors we told you before the veils\nof the temple were embroidered also. The like embroidery was upon the ephod;\nbut the quantity of gold therein was greater. Its figure was that of a\nstomacher for the breast. There were upon it two golden buttons like small\nshields, which buttoned the ephod to the garment; in these buttons were\nenclosed two very large and very excellent sardonyxes, having the names\nof the tribes of that nation engraved upon them: on the other part there\nhung twelve stones, three in a row one way, and four in the other; a sardius,\na topaz, and an emerald; a carbuncle, a jasper, and a sapphire; an agate,\nan amethyst, and a ligure; an onyx, a beryl, and a chrysolite; upon every\none of which was again engraved one of the forementioned names of the tribes.\nA mitre also of fine linen encompassed his head, which was tied by a blue\nribbon, about which there was another golden crown, in which was engraven\nthe sacred name [of God]: it consists of four vowels. However, the high\npriest did not wear these garments at other times, but a more plain habit;\nhe only did it when he went into the most sacred part of the temple, which\nhe did but once in a year, on that day when our custom is for all of us\nto keep a fast to God. And thus much concerning the city and the temple;\nbut for the customs and laws hereto relating, we shall speak more accurately\nanother time; for there remain a great many things thereto relating which\nhave not been here touched upon.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "These\nthree guards that lay in the tower of Antonia must be those that guarded\nthe city, the temple, and the tower of Antonia."}, "#text": "Now as to the tower of Antonia, it was situated at the corner of\ntwo cloisters of the court of the temple; of that on the west, and that\non the north; it was erected upon a rock of fifty cubits in height, and\nwas on a great precipice; it was the work of king Herod, wherein he demonstrated\nhis natural magnanimity. In the first place, the rock itself was covered\nover with smooth pieces of stone, from its foundation, both for ornament,\nand that any one who would either try to get up or to go down it might\nnot be able to hold his feet upon it. Next to this, and before you come\nto the edifice of the tower itself, there was a wall three cubits high;\nbut within that wall all the space of the tower of Antonia itself was built\nupon, to the height of forty cubits. The inward parts had the largeness\nand form of a palace, it being parted into all kinds of rooms and other\nconveniences, such as courts, and places for bathing, and broad spaces\nfor camps; insomuch that, by having all conveniences that cities wanted,\nit might seem to be composed of several cities, but by its magnificence\nit seemed a palace. And as the entire structure resembled that of a tower,\nit contained also four other distinct towers at its four corners; whereof\nthe others were but fifty cubits high; whereas that which lay upon the\nsoutheast corner was seventy cubits high, that from thence the whole temple\nmight be viewed; but on the corner where it joined to the two cloisters\nof the temple, it had passages down to them both, through which the guard\n(for there always lay in this tower a Roman legion) went several ways among\nthe cloisters, with their arms, on the Jewish festivals, in order to watch\nthe people, that they might not there attempt to make any innovations;\nfor the temple was a fortress that guarded the city, as was the tower of\nAntonia a guard to the temple; and in that tower were the guards of those\nthree . There\nwas also a peculiar fortress belonging to the upper city, which was Herod's\npalace; but for the hill Bezetha, it was divided from the tower Antonia,\nas we have already told you; and as that hill on which the tower of Antonia\nstood was the highest of these three, so did it adjoin to the new city,\nand was the only place that hindered the sight of the temple on the north.\nAnd this shall suffice at present to have spoken about the city and the\nwalls about it, because I have proposed to myself to make a more accurate\ndescription of it elsewhere."}, "NOW the warlike men that were in the city, and the multitude of the\nseditious that were with Simon, were ten thousand, besides the Idumeans.\nThose ten thousand had fifty commanders, over whom this Simon was supreme.\nThe Idumeans that paid him homage were five thousand, and had eight commanders,\namong whom those of greatest fame were Jacob the son of Sosas, and Simon\nthe son of Cathlas. Jotre, who had seized upon the temple, had six thousand\narmed men under twenty commanders; the zealots also that had come over\nto him, and left off their opposition, were two thousand four hundred,\nand had the same commander that they had formerly, Eleazar, together with\nSimon the son of Arinus. Now, while these factions fought one against another,\nthe people were their prey on both sides, as we have said already; and\nthat part of the people who would not join with them in their wicked practices\nwere plundered by both factions. Simon held the upper city, and the great\nwall as far as Cedron, and as much of the old wall as bent from Siloam\nto the east, and which went down to the palace of Monobazus, who was king\nof the Adiabeni, beyond Euphrates; he also held that fountain, and the\nAcra, which was no other than the lower city; he also held all that reached\nto the palace of queen Helena, the mother of Monobazus. But John held the\ntemple, and the parts thereto adjoining, for a great way, as also Ophla,\nand the valley called \"the Valley of Cedron;\" and when the parts\nthat were interposed between their possessions were burnt by them, they\nleft a space wherein they might fight with each other; for this internal\nsedition did not cease even when the Romans were encamped near their very\nwall. But although they had grown wiser at the first onset the Romans made\nupon them, this lasted but a while; for they returned to their former madness,\nand separated one from another, and fought it out, and did everything that\nthe besiegers could desire them to do; for they never suffered any thing\nthat was worse from the Romans than they made each other suffer; nor was\nthere any misery endured by the city after these men's actions that could\nbe esteemed new. But it was most of all unhappy before it was overthrown,\nwhile those that took it did it a greater kindness for I venture to affirm\nthat the sedition destroyed the city, and the Romans destroyed the sedition,\nwhich it was a much harder thing to do than to destroy the walls; so that\nwe may justly ascribe our misfortunes to our own people, and the just vengeance\ntaken on them to the Romans; as to which matter let every one determine\nby the actions on both sides.", "Now when affairs within the city were in this posture, Titus went\nround the city on the outside with some chosen horsemen, and looked about\nfor a proper place where he might make an impression upon the walls; but\nas he was in doubt where he could possibly make an attack on any side,\n(for the place was no way accessible where the valleys were, and on the\nother side the first wall appeared too strong to be shaken by the engines,)\nhe thereupon thought it best to make his assault upon the monument of John\nthe high priest; for there it was that the first fortification was lower,\nand the second was not joined to it, the builders neglecting to build strong\nwhere the new city was not much inhabited; here also was an easy passage\nto the third wall, through which he thought to take the upper city, and,\nthrough the tower of Antonia, the temple itself But at this time, as he\nwas going round about the city, one of his friends, whose name was Nicanor,\nwas wounded with a dart on his left shoulder, as he approached, together\nwith Josephus, too near the wall, and attempted to discourse to those that\nwere upon the wall, about terms of peace; for he was a person known by\nthem. On this account it was that Caesar, as soon as he knew their vehemence,\nthat they would not hear even such as approached them to persuade them\nto what tended to their own preservation, was provoked to press on the\nsiege. He also at the same time gave his soldiers leave to set the suburbs\non fire, and ordered that they should bring timber together, and raise\nbanks against the city; and when he had parted his army into three parts,\nin order to set about those works, he placed those that shot darts and\nthe archers in the midst of the banks that were then raising; before whom\nhe placed those engines that threw javelins, and darts, and stones, that\nhe might prevent the enemy from sallying out upon their works, and might\nhinder those that were upon the wall from being able to obstruct them.\nSo the trees were now cut down immediately, and the suburbs left naked.\nBut now while the timber was carrying to raise the banks, and the whole\narmy was earnestly engaged in their works, the Jews were not, however,\nquiet; and it happened that the people of Jerusalem, who had been hitherto\nplundered and murdered, were now of good courage, and supposed they should\nhave a breathing time, while the others were very busy in opposing their\nenemies without the city, and that they should now be avenged on those\nthat had been the authors of their miseries, in case the Romans did but\nget the victory.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "What should\nbe the meaning of this signal or watchword, when the watchmen saw a stone\ncoming from the engine, \"The Stone Cometh,\" or what mistake there\nis in the reading, I cannot tell. The MSS., both Greek and Latin, all agree\nin this reading; and I cannot approve of any groundless conjectural alteration\nof the text from ro to lop, that not the son or a stone, but that the arrow\nor dart cometh; as hath been made by Dr. Hudson, and not corrected by Havercamp.\nHad Josephus written even his first edition of these books of the war in\npure Hebrew, or had the Jews then used the pure Hebrew at Jerusalem, the\nHebrew word for a son is so like that for a stone, ben and eben, that such\na correction might have been more easily admitted. But Josephus wrote his\nformer edition for the use of the Jews beyond Euphrates, and so in the\nChaldee language, as he did this second edition in the Greek language;\nand bar was the Chaldee word for son, instead of the Hebrew ben, and was\nused not only in Chaldea, etc. but in Judea also, as the New Testament\ninforms us. Dio lets us know that the very Romans at Rome pronounced the\nname of Simon the son of Giora, Bar Poras for Bar Gioras, as we learn from\nXiphiline, p. 217. Reland takes notice, \"that many will here look\nfor a mystery, as though the meaning were, that the Son of God came now\nto take vengeance on the sins of the Jewish nation;\" which is indeed\nthe truth of the fact, but hardly what the Jews could now mean; unless\npossibly by way of derision of Christ's threatening so often made, that\nhe would come at the head of the Roman army for their destruction. But\neven this interpretation has but a very small degree of probability. If\nI were to make an emendation by mere conjecture, I would read instead of,\nthough the likeness be not so great as in lo; because that is the word\nused by Josephus just before, as has been already noted on this very occasion,\nwhile, an arrow or dart, is only a poetical word, and never used by Josephus\nelsewhere, and is indeed no way suitable to the occasion, this engine not\nthrowing arrows or darts, but great stones, at this time."}, "#text": "However, John staid behind, out of his fear of Simon, even while\nhis own men were earnest in making a sally upon their enemies without.\nYet did not Simon lie still, for he lay near the place of the siege; he\nbrought his engines of war, and disposed of them at due distances upon\nthe wall, both those which they took from Cestius formerly, and those which\nthey got when they seized the garrison that lay in the tower Antonia. But\nthough they had these engines in their possession, they had so little skill\nin using them, that they were in great measure useless to them; but a few\nthere were who had been taught by deserters how to use them, which they\ndid use, though after an awkward manner. So they cast stones and arrows\nat those that were making the banks; they also ran out upon them by companies,\nand fought with them. Now those that were at work covered themselves with\nhurdles spread over their banks, and their engines were opposed to them\nwhen they made their excursions. The engines, that all the legions had\nready prepared for them, were admirably contrived; but still more extraordinary\nones belonged to the tenth legion: those that threw darts and those that\nthrew stones were more forcible and larger than the rest, by which they\nnot only repelled the excursions of the Jews, but drove those away that\nwere upon the walls also. Now the stones that were cast were of the weight\nof a talent, and were carried two furlongs and further. The blow they gave\nwas no way to be sustained, not only by those that stood first in the way,\nbut by those that were beyond them for a great space. As for the Jews,\nthey at first watched the coming of the stone, for it was of a white color,\nand could therefore not only be perceived by the great noise it made, but\ncould be seen also before it came by its brightness; accordingly the watchmen\nthat sat upon the towers gave them notice when the engine was let go, and\nthe stone came from it, and cried out aloud, in their own country language,\nTHE STONE COMETH \nso those that were in its way stood off, and threw themselves down upon\nthe ground; by which means, and by their thus guarding themselves, the\nstone fell down and did them no harm. But the Romans contrived how to prevent\nthat by blacking the stone, who then could aim at them with success, when\nthe stone was not discerned beforehand, as it had been till then; and so\nthey destroyed many of them at one blow. Yet did not the Jews, under all\nthis distress, permit the Romans to raise their banks in quiet; but they\nshrewdly and boldly exerted themselves, and repelled them both by night\nand by day."}, "And now, upon the finishing the Roman works, the workmen measured\nthe distance there was from the wall, and this by lead and a line, which\nthey threw to it from their banks; for they could not measure it any otherwise,\nbecause the Jews would shoot at them, if they came to measure it themselves;\nand when they found that the engines could reach the wall, they brought\nthem thither. Then did Titus set his engines at proper distances, so much\nnearer to the wall, that the Jews might not be able to repel them, and\ngave orders they should go to work; and when thereupon a prodigious noise\nechoed round about from three places, and that on the sudden there was\na great noise made by the citizens that were within the city, and no less\na terror fell upon the seditious themselves; whereupon both sorts, seeing\nthe common danger they were in, contrived to make a like defense. So those\nof different factions cried out one to another, that they acted entirely\nas in concert with their enemies; whereas they ought however, notwithstanding\nGod did not grant them a lasting concord, in their present circumstances,\nto lay aside their enmities one against another, and to unite together\nagainst the Romans. Accordingly, Simon gave those that came from the temple\nleave, by proclamation, to go upon the wall; John also himself, though\nhe could not believe Simon was in earnest, gave them the same leave. So\non both sides they laid aside their hatred and their peculiar quarrels,\nand formed themselves into one body; they then ran round the walls, and\nhaving a vast number of torches with them, they threw them at the machines,\nand shot darts perpetually upon those that impelled those engines which\nbattered the wall; nay, the bolder sort leaped out by troops upon the hurdles\nthat covered the machines, and pulled them to pieces, and fell upon those\nthat belonged to them, and beat them, not so much by any skill they had,\nas principally by the boldness of their attacks. However, Titus himself\nstill sent assistance to those that were the hardest set, and placed both\nhorsemen and archers on the several sides of the engines, and thereby beat\noff those that brought the fire to them; he also thereby repelled those\nthat shot stones or darts from the towers, and then set the engines to\nwork in good earnest; yet did not the wall yield to these blows, excepting\nwhere the battering ram of the fifteenth legion moved the corner of a tower,\nwhile the wall itself continued unhurt; for the wall was not presently\nin the same danger with the tower, which was extant far above it; nor could\nthe fall of that part of the tower easily break down any part of the wall\nitself together with it.", "And now the Jews intermitted their sallies for a while; but when\nthey observed the Romans dispersed all abroad at their works, and in their\nseveral camps, (for they thought the Jews had retired out of weariness\nand fear,) they all at once made a sally at the tower Hippicus, through\nan obscure gate, and at the same time brought fire to burn the works, and\nwent boldly up to the Romans, and to their very fortifications themselves,\nwhere, at the cry they made, those that were near them came presently to\ntheir assistance, and those farther off came running after them; and here\nthe boldness of the Jews was too hard for the good order of the Romans;\nand as they beat those whom they first fell upon, so they pressed upon\nthose that were now gotten together. So this fight about the machines was\nvery hot, while the one side tried hard to set them on fire, and the other\nside to prevent it; on both sides there was a confused cry made, and many\nof those in the forefront of the battle were slain. However, the Jews were\nnow too hard for the Romans, by the furious assaults they made like madmen;\nand the fire caught hold of the works, and both all those works, and the\nengines themselves, had been in danger of being burnt, had not many of\nthese select soldiers that came from Alexandria opposed themselves to prevent\nit, and had they not behaved themselves with greater courage than they\nthemselves supposed they could have done; for they outdid those in this\nfight that had greater reputation than themselves before. This was the\nstate of things till Caesar took the stoutest of his horsemen, and attacked\nthe enemy, while he himself slew twelve of those that were in the forefront\nof the Jews; which death of these men, when the rest of the multitude saw,\nthey gave way, and he pursued them, and drove them all into the city, and\nsaved the works from the fire. Now it happened at this fight that a certain\nJew was taken alive, who, by Titus's order, was crucified before the wall,\nto see whether the rest of them would be aftrighted, and abate of their\nobstinacy. But after the Jews were retired, John, who was commander of\nthe Idumeans, and was talking to a certain soldier of his acquaintance\nbefore the wall, was wounded by a dart shot at him by an Arabian, and died\nimmediately, leaving the greatest lamentation to the Jews, and sorrow to\nthe seditious. For he was a man of great eminence, both for his actions\nand his conduct also.", "NOW, on the next night, a surprising disturbance fell upon the Romans;\nfor whereas Titus had given orders for the erection of three towers of\nfifty cubits high, that by setting men upon them at every bank, he might\nfrom thence drive those away who were upon the wall, it so happened that\none of these towers fell down about midnight; and as its fall made a very\ngreat noise, fear fell upon the army, and they, supposing that the enemy\nwas coming to attack them, ran all to their arms. Whereupon a disturbance\nand a tumult arose among the legions, and as nobody could tell what had\nhappened, they went on after a disconsolate manner; and seeing no enemy\nappear, they were afraid one of another, and every one demanded of his\nneighbor the watchword with great earnestness, as though the Jews had invaded\ntheir camp. And now were they like people under a panic fear, till Titus\nwas informed of what had happened, and gave orders that all should be acquainted\nwith it; and then, though with some difficulty, they got clear of the disturbance\nthey had been under.", "Now these towers were very troublesome to the Jews, who otherwise\nopposed the Romans very courageously; for they shot at them out of their\nlighter engines from those towers, as they did also by those that threw\ndarts, and the archers, and those that flung stones. For neither could\nthe Jews reach those that were over them, by reason of their height; and\nit was not practicable to take them, nor to overturn them, they were so\nheavy, nor to set them on fire, because they were covered with plates of\niron. So they retired out of the reach of the darts, and did no longer\nendeavor to hinder the impression of their rams, which, by continually\nbeating upon the wall, did gradually prevail against it; so that the wall\nalready gave way to the Nico, for by that name did the Jews themselves\ncall the greatest of their engines, because it conquered all things. And\nnow they were for a long while grown weary of fighting, and of keeping\nguards, and were retired to lodge in the night time at a distance from\nthe wall. It was on other accounts also thought by them to be superfluous\nto guard the wall, there being besides that two other fortifications still\nremaining, and they being slothful, and their counsels having been ill\nconcerted on all occasions; so a great many grew lazy and retired. Then\nthe Romans mounted the breach, where Nico had made one, and all the Jews\nleft the guarding that wall, and retreated to the second wall; so those\nthat had gotten over that wall opened the gates, and received all the army\nwithin it. And thus did the Romans get possession of this first wall, on\nthe fifteenth day of the siege, which was the seventh day of the month\nArtemisius, [Jyar,] when they demolished a great part of it, as well as\nthey did of the northern parts of the city, which had been demolished also\nby Cestius formerly.", "And now Titus pitched his camp within the city, at that place which\nwas called \"the Camp of the Assyrians,\" having seized upon all\nthat lay as far as Cedron, but took care to be out of the reach of the\nJews' darts. He then presently began his attacks, upon which the Jews divided\nthemselves into several bodies, and courageously defended that wall; while\nJohn and his faction did it from the tower of Antonia, and from the northern\ncloister of the temple, and fought the Romans before the monuments of king\nAlexander; and Sireoh's army also took for their share the spot of ground\nthat was near John's monument, and fortified it as far as to that gate\nwhere water was brought in to the tower Hippicus. However, the Jews made\nviolent sallies, and that frequently also, and in bodies together out of\nthe gates, and there fought the Romans; and when they were pursued all\ntogether to the wall, they were beaten in those fights, as wanting the\nskill of the Romans. But when they fought them from the walls, they were\ntoo hard for them; the Romans being encouraged by their power, joined to\ntheir skill, as were the Jews by their boldness, which was nourished by\nthe fear they were in, and that hardiness which is natural to our nation\nunder calamities; they were also encouraged still by the hope of deliverance,\nas were the Romans by their hopes of subduing them in a little time. Nor\ndid either side grow weary; but attacks and rightings upon the wall, and\nperpetual sallies out in bodies, were there all the day long; nor were\nthere any sort of warlike engagements that were not then put in use. And\nthe night itself had much ado to part them, when they began to fight in\nthe morning; nay, the night itself was passed without sleep on both sides,\nand was more uneasy than the day to them, while the one was afraid lest\nthe wall should be taken, and the other lest the Jews should make sallies\nupon their camps; both sides also lay in their armor during the night time,\nand thereby were ready at the first appearance of light to go to the battle.\nNow among the Jews the ambition was who should undergo the first dangers,\nand thereby gratify their commanders. Above all, they had a great veneration\nand dread of Simon; and to that degree was he regarded by every one of\nthose that were under him, that at his command they were very ready to\nkill themselves with their own hands. What made the Romans so courageous\nwas their usual custom of conquering and disuse of being defeated, their\nconstant wars, and perpetual warlike exercises, and the grandeur of their\ndominion; and what was now their chief encouragement -Titus who was present\nevery where with them all; for it appeared a terrible thing to grow weary\nwhile Caesar was there, and fought bravely as well as they did, and was\nhimself at once an eye-witness of such as behaved themselves valiantly,\nand he who was to reward them also. It was, besides, esteemed an advantage\nat present to have any one's valor known by Caesar; on which account many\nof them appeared to have more alacrity than strength to answer it. And\nnow, as the Jews were about this time standing in array before the wall,\nand that in a strong body, and while both parties were throwing their darts\nat each other, Longinus, one of the equestrian order, leaped out of the\narmy of the Romans, and leaped into the very midst of the army of the Jews;\nand as they dispersed themselves upon the attack, he slew two of their\nmen of the greatest courage; one of them he struck in his mouth as he was\ncoming to meet him, the other was slain by him by that very dart which\nhe drew out of the body of the other, with which he ran this man through\nhis side as he was running away from him; and when he had done this, he\nfirst of all ran out of the midst of his enemies to his own side. So this\nman signalized himself for his valor, and many there were who were ambitious\nof gaining the like reputation. And now the Jews were unconcerned at what\nthey suffered themselves from the Romans, and were only solicitous about\nwhat mischief they could do them; and death itself seemed a small matter\nto them, if at the same time they could but kill any one of their enemies.\nBut Titus took care to secure his own soldiers from harm, as well as to\nhave them overcome their enemies. He also said that inconsiderate violence\nwas madness, and that this alone was the true courage that was joined with\ngood conduct. He therefore commanded his men to take care, when they fought\ntheir enemies, that they received no harm from them at the same time, and\nthereby show themselves to be truly valiant men.", "And now Titus brought one of his engines to the middle tower of the\nnorth part of the wall, in which a certain crafty Jew, whose name was Castor,\nlay in ambush, with ten others like himself, the rest being fled away by\nreason of the archers. These men lay still for a while, as in great fear,\nunder their breastplates; but when the tower was shaken, they arose, and\nCastor did then stretch out his hand, as a petitioner, and called for Caesar,\nand by his voice moved his compassion, and begged of him to have mercy\nupon them; and Titus, in the innocency of his heart, believing him to be\nin earnest, and hoping that the Jews did now repent, stopped the working\nof the battering ram, and forbade them to shoot at the petitioners, and\nbid Castor say what he had a mind to say to him. He said that he would\ncome down, if he would give him his right hand for his security. To which\nTitus replied, that he was well pleased with such his agreeable conduct,\nand would be well pleased if all the Jews would be of his mind, and that\nhe was ready to give the like security to the city. Now five of the ten\ndissembled with him, and pretended to beg for mercy, while the rest cried\nout aloud that they would never be slaves to the Romans, while it was in\ntheir power to die in a state of freedom. Now while these men were quarrelling\nfor a long while, the attack was delayed; Castor also sent to Simon, and\ntold him that they might take some time for consultation about what was\nto be done, because he would elude the power of the Romans for a considerable\ntime. And at the same time that he sent thus to him, he appeared openly\nto exhort those that were obstinate to accept of Titus's hand for their\nsecurity; but they seemed very angry at it, and brandished their naked\nswords upon the breast-works, and struck themselves upon their breast,\nand fell down as if they had been slain. Hereupon Titus, and those with\nhim, were amazed at the courage of the men; and as they were not able to\nsee exactly what was done, they admired at their great fortitude, and pitied\ntheir calamity. During this interval, a certain person shot a dart at Castor,\nand wounded him in his nose; whereupon he presently pulled out the dart,\nand showed it to Titus, and complained that this was unfair treatment;\nso Caesar reproved him that shot the dart, and sent Josephus, who then\nstood by him, to give his right hand to Castor. But Josephus said that\nhe would not go to him, because these pretended petitioners meant nothing\nthat was good; he also restrained those friends of his who were zealous\nto go to him. But still there was one Eneas, a deserter, who said he would\ngo to him. Castor also called to them, that somebody should come and receive\nthe money which he had with him; this made Eneas the more earnestly to\nrun to him with his bosom open. Then did Castor take up a great stone,\nand threw it at him, which missed him, because he guarded himself against\nit; but still it wounded another soldier that was coining to him. When\nCaesar understood that this was a delusion, he perceived that mercy in\nwar is a pernicious thing, because such cunning tricks have less place\nunder the exercise of greater severity. So he caused the engine to work\nmore strongly than before, on account of his anger at the deceit put upon\nhim. But Castor and his companions set the tower on fire when it began\nto give way, and leaped through the flame into a hidden vault that was\nunder it, which made the Romans further suppose that they were men of great\ncourage, as having cast themselves into the fire.", "NOW Caesar took this wall there on the fifth day after he had taken\nthe first; and when the Jews had fled from him, he entered into it with\na thousand armed men, and those of his choice troops, and this at a place\nwhere were the merchants of wool, the braziers, and the market for cloth,\nand where the narrow streets led obliquely to the wall. Wherefore, if Titus\nhad either demolished a larger part of the wall immediately, or had come\nin, and, according to the law of war, had laid waste what was left, his\nvictory would not, I suppose, have been mixed with any loss to himself.\nBut now, out of the hope he had that he should make the Jews ashamed of\ntheir obstinacy, by not being willing, when he was able, to afflict them\nmore than he needed to do, he did not widen the breach of the wall, in\norder to make a safer retreat upon occasion; for he did not think they\nwould lay snares for him that did them such a kindness. When therefore\nhe came in, he did not permit his soldiers to kill any of those they caught,\nnor to set fire to their houses neither; nay, he gave leave to the seditious,\nif they had a mind, to fight without any harm to the people, and promised\nto restore the people's effects to them; for he was very desirous to preserve\nthe city for his own sake, and the temple for the sake of the city. As\nto the people, he had them of a long time ready to comply with his proposals;\nbut as to the fighting men, this humanity of his seemed a mark of his weakness,\nand they imagined that he made these proposals because he was not able\nto take the rest of the city. They also threatened death to the people,\nif they should any one of them say a word about a surrender. They moreover\ncut the throats of such as talked of a peace, and then attacked those Romans\nthat were come within the wall. Some of them they met in the narrow streets,\nand some they fought against from their houses, while they made a sudden\nsally out at the upper gates, and assaulted such Romans as were beyond\nthe wall, till those that guarded the wall were so aftrighted, that they\nleaped down from their towers, and retired to their several camps: upon\nwhich a great noise was made by the Romans that were within, because they\nwere encompassed round on every side by their enemies; as also by them\nthat were without, because they were in fear for those that were left in\nthe city. Thus did the Jews grow more numerous perpetually, and had great\nadvantages over the Romans, by their full knowledge of those narrow lanes;\nand they wounded a great many of them, and fell upon them, and drove them\nout of the city. Now these Romans were at present forced to make the best\nresistance they could; for they were not able, in great numbers, to get\nout at the breach in the wall, it was so narrow. It is also probable that\nall those that were gotten within had been cut to pieces, if Titus had\nnot sent them succors; for he ordered the archers to stand at the upper\nends of these narrow lakes, and he stood himself where was the greatest\nmultitude of his enemies, and with his darts he put a stop to them; as\nwith him did Domitius Sabinus also, a valiant man, and one that in this\nbattle appeared so to be. Thus did Caesar continue to shoot darts at the\nJews continually, and to hinder them from coming upon his men, and this\nuntil all his soldiers had retreated out of the city.", "And thus were the Romans driven out, after they had possessed themselves\nof the second wall. Whereupon the fighting men that were in the city were\nlifted up in their minds, and were elevated upon this their good success,\nand began to think that the Romans would never venture to come into the\ncity any more; and that if they kept within it themselves, they should\nnot be any more conquered. For God had blinded their minds for the transgressions\nthey had been guilty of, nor could they see how much greater forces the\nRomans had than those that were now expelled, no more than they could discern\nhow a famine was creeping upon them; for hitherto they had fed themselves\nout of the public miseries, and drank the blood of the city. But now poverty\nhad for a long time seized upon the better part, and a great many had died\nalready for want of necessaries; although the seditious indeed supposed\nthe destruction of the people to be an easement to themselves; for they\ndesired that none others might be preserved but such as were against a\npeace with the Romans, and were resolved to live in opposition to them,\nand they were pleased when the multitude of those of a contrary opinion\nwere consumed, as being then freed from a heavy burden. And this was their\ndisposition of mind with regard to those that were within the city, while\nthey covered themselves with their armor, and prevented the Romans, when\nthey were trying to get into the city again, and made a wall of their own\nbodies over against that part of the wall that was cast down. Thus did\nthey valiantly defend themselves for three days; but on the fourth day\nthey could not support themselves against the vehement assaults of Titus\nbut were compelled by force to fly whither they had fled before; so he\nquietly possessed himself again of that wall, and demolished it entirely.\nAnd when he had put a garrison into the towers that were on the south parts\nof the city, he contrived how he might assault the third wall.", "A RESOLUTION was now taken by Titus to relax the siege for a little\nwhile, and to afford the seditious an interval for consideration, and to\nsee whether the demolishing of their second wall would not make them a\nlittle more compliant, or whether they were not somewhat afraid of a famine,\nbecause the spoils they had gotten by rapine would not be sufficient for\nthem long; so he made use of this relaxation in order to compass his own\ndesigns. Accordingly, as the usual appointed time when he must distribute\nsubsistence money to the soldiers was now come, he gave orders that the\ncommanders should put the army into battle-array, in the face of the enemy,\nand then give every one of the soldiers their pay. So the soldiers, according\nto custom, opened the cases wherein their arms before lay covered, and\nmarched with their breastplates on, as did the horsemen lead their horses\nin their fine trappings. Then did the places that were before the city\nshine very splendidly for a great way; nor was there any thing so grateful\nto Titus's own men, or so terrible to the enemy, as that sight. For the\nwhole old wall, and the north side of the temple, were full of spectators,\nand one might see the houses full of such as looked at them; nor was there\nany part of the city which was not covered over with their multitudes;\nnay, a very great consternation seized upon the hardiest of the Jews themselves,\nwhen they saw all the army in the same place, together with the fineness\nof their arms, and the good order of their men. And I cannot but think\nthat the seditious would have changed their minds at that sight, unless\nthe crimes they had committed against the people had been so horrid, that\nthey despaired of forgiveness from the Romans; but as they believed death\nwith torments must be their punishment, if they did not go on in the defense\nof the city, they thought it much better to die in war. Fate also prevailed\nso far over them, that the innocent were to perish with the guilty, and\nthe city was to be destroyed with the seditious that were in it.", "Thus did the Romans spend four days in bringing this subsistence-money\nto the several legions. But on the fifth day, when no signs of peace appeared\nto come from the Jews, Titus divided his legions, and began to raise banks,\nboth at the tower of Antonia and at John's monument. Now his designs were\nto take the upper city at that monument, and the temple at the tower of\nAntonia; for if the temple were not taken, it would be dangerous to keep\nthe city itself; so at each of these parts he raised him banks, each legion\nraising one. As for those that wrought at John's monument, the Idumeans,\nand those that were in arms with Simon, made sallies upon them, and put\nsome stop to them; while John's party, and the multitude of zealots with\nthem, did the like to those that were before the tower of Antonia. These\nJews were now too hard for the Romans, not only in direct fighting, because\nthey stood upon the higher ground, but because they had now learned to\nuse their own engines; for their continual use of them one day after another\ndid by degrees improve their skill about them; for of one sort of engines\nfor darts they had three hundred, and forty for stones; by the means of\nwhich they made it more tedious for the Romans to raise their banks. But\nthen Titus, knowing that the city would be either saved or destroyed for\nhimself, did not only proceed earnestly in the siege, but did not omit\nto have the Jews exhorted to repentance; so he mixed good counsel with\nhis works for the siege. And being sensible that exhortations are frequently\nmore effectual than arms, he persuaded them to surrender the city, now\nin a manner already taken, and thereby to save themselves, and sent Josephus\nto speak to them in their own language; for he imagined they might yield\nto the persuasion of a countryman of their own.", "So Josephus went round about the wall, and tried to find a place\nthat was out of the reach of their darts, and yet within their hearing,\nand besought them, in many words, to spare themselves, to spare their country\nand their temple, and not to be more obdurate in these cases than foreigners\nthemselves; for that the Romans, who had no relation to those things, had\na reverence for their sacred rites and places, although they belonged to\ntheir enemies, and had till now kept their hands off from meddling with\nthem; while such as were brought up under them, and, if they be preserved,\nwill be the only people that will reap the benefit of them, hurry on to\nhave them destroyed. That certainly they have seen their strongest walls\ndemolished, and that the wall still remaining was weaker than those that\nwere already taken. That they must know the Roman power was invincible,\nand that they had been used to serve them; for, that in case it be allowed\na right thing to fight for liberty, that ought to have been done at first;\nbut for them that have once fallen under the power of the Romans, and have\nnow submitted to them for so many long years, to pretend to shake off that\nyoke afterward, was the work of such as had a mind to die miserably, not\nof such as were lovers of liberty. Besides, men may well enough grudge\nat the dishonor of owning ignoble masters over them, but ought not to do\nso to those who have all things under their command; for what part of the\nworld is there that hath escaped the Romans, unless it be such as are of\nno use for violent heat, or for violent cold? And evident it is that fortune\nis on all hands gone over to them; and that God, when he had gone round\nthe nations with this dominion, is now settled in Italy. That, moreover,\nit is a strong and fixed law, even among brute beasts, as well as among\nmen, to yield to those that are too strong for them; and to stiffer those\nto have the dominion who are too hard for the rest in war; for which reason\nit was that their forefathers, who were far superior to them, both in their\nsouls and bodies, and other advantages, did yet submit to the Romans, which\nthey would not have suffered, had they not known that God was with them.\nAs for themselves, what can they depend on in this their opposition, when\nthe greatest part of their city is already taken? and when those that are\nwithin it are under greater miseries than if they were taken, although\ntheir walls be still standing? For that the Romans are not unacquainted\nwith that famine which is in the city, whereby the people are already consumed,\nand the fighting men will in a little time be so too; for although the\nRomans should leave off the siege, and not fall upon the city with their\nswords in their hands, yet was there an insuperable war that beset them\nwithin, and was augmented every hour, unless they were able to wage war\nwith famine, and fight against it, or could alone conquer their natural\nappetites. He added this further, how right a thing it was to change their\nconduct before their calamities were become incurable, and to have recourse\nto such advice as might preserve them, while opportunity was offered them\nfor so doing; for that the Romans would not be mindful of their past actions\nto their disadvantage, unless they persevered in their insolent behavior\nto the end; because they were naturally mild in their conquests, and preferred\nwhat was profitable, before what their passions dictated to them; which\nprofit of theirs lay not in leaving the city empty of inhabitants, nor\nthe country a desert; on which account Caesar did now offer them his right\nhand for their security. Whereas, if he took the city by force, he would\nnot save any of them, and this especially, if they rejected his offers\nin these their utmost distresses; for the walls that were already taken\ncould not but assure them that the third wall would quickly be taken also.\nAnd though their fortifications should prove too strong for the Romans\nto break through them, yet would the famine fight for the Romans against\nthem.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Josephus\nsupposes, in this his admirable speech to the Jews, that not Abraham only,\nbut Pharaoh king of Egypt, prayed towards a temple at Jerusalem, or towards\nJerusalem itself, in which were Mount Sion and Mount Moriah, on which the\ntabernacle and temple did afterwards stand; and this long before either\nthe Jewish tabernacle or temple were built.

When did we ever conquer\nany other nation by such means? and when was it that God, who is the Creator\nof the Jewish people, did not avenge them when they had been injured? Will\nnot you turn again, and look back, and consider whence it is that you fight\nwith such violence, and how great a Supporter you have profanely abused?\nWill not you recall to mind the prodigious things done for your forefathers\nand this holy place, and how great enemies of yours were by him subdued\nunder you? I even tremble myself in declaring the works of God before your\nears, that are unworthy to hear them; however, hearken to me, that you\nmay be informed how you fight not only against the Romans, but against\nGod himself. In old times there was one Necao, king of Egypt, who was also\ncalled Pharaoh; he came with a prodigious army of soldiers, and seized\nqueen Sarah, the mother of our nation. What did Abraham our progenitor\nthen do? Did he defend himself from this injurious person by war, although\nhe had three hundred and eighteen captains under him, and an immense army\nunder each of them? Indeed he deemed them to be no number at all without\nGod's assistance, and only spread out his hands towards this holy place,\n which you\nhave now polluted, and reckoned upon him as upon his invincible supporter,\ninstead of his own army. Was not our queen sent back, without any defilement,\nto her husband, the very next evening? - while the king of Egypt fled away,\nadoring this place which you have defiled by shedding thereon the blood\nof your own countrymen; and he also trembled at those visions which he\nsaw in the night season, and bestowed both silver and gold on the Hebrews,\nas on a people beloved by God. Shall I say nothing, or shall I mention\nthe removal of our fathers into Egypt, who, \nwhen they were used tyrannically, and were fallen under the power of foreign\nkings for four hundred ears together, and might have defended themselves\nby war and by fighting, did yet do nothing but commit themselves to God!\nWho is there that does not know that Egypt was overrun with all sorts of\nwild beasts, and consumed by all sorts of distempers? how their land did\nnot bring forth its fruit? how the Nile failed of water? how the ten plagues\nof Egypt followed one upon another? and how by those means our fathers\nwere sent away under a guard, without any bloodshed, and without running\nany dangers, because God conducted them as his peculiar servants? Moreover,\ndid not Palestine groan under the ravage the Assyrians made, when they\ncarried away our sacred ark? as did their idol Dagon, and as also did that\nentire nation of those that carried it away, how they were smitten with\na loathsome distemper in the secret parts of their bodies, when their very\nbowels came down together with what they had eaten, till those hands that\nstole it away were obliged to bring it back again, and that with the sound\nof cymbals and timbrels, and other oblations, in order to appease the anger\nof God for their violation of his holy ark. It was God who then became\nour General, and accomplished these great things for our fathers, and this\nbecause they did not meddle with war and fighting, but committed it to\nhim to judge about their affairs. When Sennacherib, king of Assyria, brought\nalong with him all Asia, and encompassed this city round with his army,\ndid he fall by the hands of men? were not those hands lifted up to God\nin prayers, without meddling with their arms, when an angel of God destroyed\nthat prodigious army in one night? when the Assyrian king, as he rose the\nnext day, found a hundred fourscore and five thousand dead bodies, and\nwhen he, with the remainder of his army, fled away from the Hebrews, though\nthey were unarmed, and did not pursue them. You are also acquainted with\nthe slavery we were under at Babylon, where the people were captives for\nseventy years; yet were they not delivered into freedom again before God\nmade Cyrus his gracious instrument in bringing it about; accordingly they\nwere set free by him, and did again restore the worship of their Deliverer\nat his temple. And, to speak in general, we can produce no example wherein\nour fathers got any success by war, or failed of success when without war\nthey committed themselves to God. When they staid at home, they conquered,\nas pleased their Judge; but when they went out to fight, they were always\ndisappointed: for example, when the king of Babylon besieged this very\ncity, and our king Zedekiah fought against him, contrary to what predictions\nwere made to him by Jeremiah the prophet, he was at once taken prisoner,\nand saw the city and the temple demolished. Yet how much greater was the\nmoderation of that king, than is that of your present governors, and that\nof the people then under him, than is that of you at this time! for when\nJeremiah cried out aloud, how very angry God was at them, because of their\ntransgressions, and told them they should be taken prisoners, unless they\nwould surrender up their city, neither did the king nor the people put\nhim to death; but for you, (to pass over what you have done within the\ncity, which I am not able to describe as your wickedness deserves,) you\nabuse me, and throw darts at me, who only exhort you to save yourselves,\nas being provoked when you are put in mind of your sins, and cannot bear\nthe very mention of those crimes which you every day perpetrate. For another\nexample, when Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, lay before this city,\nand had been guilty of many indignities against God, and our forefathers\nmet him in arms, they then were slain in the battle, this city was plundered\nby our enemies, and our sanctuary made desolate for three years and six\nmonths. And what need I bring any more examples? Indeed what can it be\nthat hath stirred up an army of the Romans against our nation? Is it not\nthe impiety of the inhabitants? Whence did our servitude commence? Was\nit not derived from the seditions that were among our forefathers, when\nthe madness of Aristobulus and Hyrcanus, and our mutual quarrels, brought\nPompey upon this city, and when God reduced those under subjection to the\nRomans who were unworthy of the liberty they had enjoyed? After a siege,\ntherefore, of three months, they were forced to surrender themselves, although\nthey had not been guilty of such offenses, with regard to our sanctuary\nand our laws, as you have; and this while they had much greater advantages\nto go to war than you have. Do not we know what end Antigonus, the son\nof Aristobulus, came to, under whose reign God provided that this city\nshould be taken again upon account of the people's offenses? When Herod,\nthe son of Antipater, brought upon us Sosius, and Sosius brought upon us\nthe Roman army, they were then encompassed and besieged for six months,\ntill, as a punishment for their sins, they were taken, and the city was\nplundered by the enemy. Thus it appears that arms were never given to our\nnation, but that we are always given up to be fought against, and to be\ntaken; for I suppose that such as inhabit this holy place ought to commit\nthe disposal of all things to God, and then only to disregard the assistance\nof men when they resign themselves up to their Arbitrator, who is above.\nAs for you, what have you done of those things that are recommended by\nour legislator? and what have you not done of those things that he hath\ncondemned? How much more impious are you than those who were so quickly\ntaken! You have not avoided so much as those sins that are usually done\nin secret; I mean thefts, and treacherous plots against men, and adulteries.\nYou are quarrelling about rapines and murders, and invent strange ways\nof wickedness. Nay, the temple itself is become the receptacle of all,\nand this Divine place is polluted by the hands of those of our own country;\nwhich place hath yet been reverenced by the Romans when it was at a distance\nfrom them, when they have suffered many of their own customs to give place\nto our law. And, after all this, do you expect Him whom you have so impiously\nabused to be your supporter? To be sure then you have a right to be petitioners,\nand to call upon Him to assist you, so pure are your hands! Did your king\n[Hezekiah] lift up such hands in prayer to God against the king of Assyria,\nwhen he destroyed that great army in one night? And do the Romans commit\nsuch wickedness as did the king of Assyria, that you may have reason to\nhope for the like vengeance upon them? Did not that king accept of money\nfrom our king on this condition, that he should not destroy the city, and\nyet, contrary to the oath he had taken, he came down to burn the temple?\nwhile the Romans do demand no more than that accustomed tribute which our\nfathers paid to their fathers; and if they may but once obtain that, they\nneither aim to destroy this city, nor to touch this sanctuary; nay, they\nwill grant you besides, that your posterity shall be free, and your possessions\nsecured to you, and will preserve our holy laws inviolate to you. And it\nis plain madness to expect that God should appear as well disposed towards\nthe wicked as towards the righteous, since he knows when it is proper to\npunish men for their sins immediately; accordingly he brake the power of\nthe Assyrians the very first night that they pitched their camp. Wherefore,\nhad he judged that our nation was worthy of freedom, or the Romans of punishment,\nhe had immediately inflicted punishment upon those Romans, as he did upon\nthe Assyrians, when Pompey began to meddle with our nation, or when after\nhim Sosius came up against us, or when Vespasian laid waste Galilee, or,\nlastly, when Titus came first of all near to this city; although Magnus\nand Sosius did not only suffer nothing, but took the city by force; as\ndid Vespasian go from the war he made against you to receive the empire;\nand as for Titus, those springs that were formerly almost dried up when\nthey were under your power \nsince he is come, run more plentifully than they did before; accordingly,\nyou know that Siloam, as well as all the other springs that were without\nthe city, did so far fail, that water was sold by distinct measures; whereas\nthey now have such a great quantity of water for your enemies, as is sufficient\nnot only for drink both for themselves and their cattle, but for watering\ntheir gardens also. The same wonderful sign you had also experience of\nformerly, when the forementioned king of Babylon made war against us, and\nwhen he took the city, and burnt the temple; while yet I believe the Jews\nof that age were not so impious as you are. Wherefore I cannot but suppose\nthat God is fled out of his sanctuary, and stands on the side of those\nagainst whom you fight. Now even a man, if he be but a good man, will fly\nfrom an impure house, and will hate those that are in it; and do you persuade\nyourselves that God will abide with you in your iniquities, who sees all\nsecret things, and hears what is kept most private? Now what crime is there,\nI pray you, that is so much as kept secret among you, or is concealed by\nyou? nay, what is there that is not open to your very enemies? for you\nshow your transgressions after a pompous manner, and contend one with another\nwhich of you shall be more wicked than another; and you make a public demonstration\nof your injustice, as if it were virtue. However, there is a place left\nfor your preservation, if you be willing to accept of it; and God is easily\nreconciled to those that confess their faults, and repent of them. O hard-hearted\nwretches as you are! cast away all your arms, and take pity of your country\nalready going to ruin; return from your wicked ways, and have regard to\nthe excellency of that city which you are going to betray, to that excellent\ntemple with the donations of so many countries in it. Who could bear to\nbe the first that should set that temple on fire? who could be willing\nthat these things should be no more? and what is there that can better\ndeserve to be preserved? O insensible creatures, and more stupid than are\nthe stones themselves! And if you cannot look at these things with discerning\neyes, yet, however, have pity upon your families, and set before every\none of your eyes your children, and wives, and parents, who will be gradually\nconsumed either by famine or by war. I am sensible that this danger will\nextend to my mother, and wife, and to that family of mine who have been\nby no means ignoble, and indeed to one that hath been very eminent in old\ntime; and perhaps you may imagine that it is on their account only that\nI give you this advice; if that be all, kill them; nay, take my own blood\nas a reward, if it may but procure your preservation; for I am ready to\ndie, in case you will but return to a sound mind after my death.\""}, "AS Josephus was speaking thus with a loud voice, the seditious would\nneither yield to what he said, nor did they deem it safe for them to alter\ntheir conduct; but as for the people, they had a great inclination to desert\nto the Romans; accordingly, some of them sold what they had, and even the\nmost precious things that had been laid up as treasures by them, for every\nsmall matter, and swallowed down pieces of gold, that they might not be\nfound out by the robbers; and when they had escaped to the Romans, went\nto stool, and had wherewithal to provide plentifully for themselves; for\nTitus let a great number of them go away into the country, whither they\npleased. And the main reasons why they were so ready to desert were these:\nThat now they should be freed from those miseries which they had endured\nin that city, and yet should not be in slavery to the Romans: however,\nJohn and Simon, with their factions, did more carefully watch these men's\ngoing out than they did the coming in of the Romans; and if any one did\nbut afford the least shadow of suspicion of such an intention, his throat\nwas cut immediately.", "But as for the richer sort, it proved all one to them whether they\nstaid in the city, or attempted to get out of it; for they were equally\ndestroyed in both cases; for every such person was put to death under this\npretense, that they were going to desert, but in reality that the robbers\nmight get what they had. The madness of the seditious did also increase\ntogether with their famine, and both those miseries were every day inflamed\nmore and more; for there was no corn which any where appeared publicly,\nbut the robbers came running into, and searched men's private houses; and\nthen, if they found any, they tormented them, because they had denied they\nhad any; and if they found none, they tormented them worse, because they\nsupposed they had more carefully concealed it. The indication they made\nuse of whether they had any or not was taken from the bodies of these miserable\nwretches; which, if they were in good case, they supposed they were in\nno want at all of food; but if they were wasted away, they walked off without\nsearching any further; nor did they think it proper to kill such as these,\nbecause they saw they would very soon die of themselves for want of food.\nMany there were indeed who sold what they had for one measure; it was of\nwheat, if they were of the richer sort; but of barley, if they were poorer.\nWhen these had so done, they shut themselves up in the inmost rooms of\ntheir houses, and ate the corn they had gotten; some did it without grinding\nit, by reason of the extremity of the want they were in, and others baked\nbread of it, according as necessity and fear dictated to them: a table\nwas no where laid for a distinct meal, but they snatched the bread out\nof the fire, half-baked, and ate it very hastily.", "It was now a miserable case, and a sight that would justly bring\ntears into our eyes, how men stood as to their food, while the more powerful\nhad more than enough, and the weaker were lamenting [for want of it.] But\nthe famine was too hard for all other passions, and it is destructive to\nnothing so much as to modesty; for what was otherwise worthy of reverence\nwas in this case despised; insomuch that children pulled the very morsels\nthat their fathers were eating out of their very mouths, and what was still\nmore to be pitied, so did the mothers do as to their infants; and when\nthose that were most dear were perishing under their hands, they were not\nashamed to take from them the very last drops that might preserve their\nlives: and while they ate after this manner, yet were they not concealed\nin so doing; but the seditious every where came upon them immediately,\nand snatched away from them what they had gotten from others; for when\nthey saw any house shut up, this was to them a signal that the people within\nhad gotten some food; whereupon they broke open the doors, and ran in,\nand took pieces of what they were eating almost up out of their very throats,\nand this by force: the old men, who held their food fast, were beaten;\nand if the women hid what they had within their hands, their hair was torn\nfor so doing; nor was there any commiseration shown either to the aged\nor to the infants, but they lifted up children from the ground as they\nhung upon the morsels they had gotten, and shook them down upon the floor.\nBut still they were more barbarously cruel to those that had prevented\ntheir coming in, and had actually swallowed down what they were going to\nseize upon, as if they had been unjustly defrauded of their right. They\nalso invented terrible methods of torments to discover where any food was,\nand they were these to stop up the passages of the privy parts of the miserable\nwretches, and to drive sharp stakes up their fundaments; and a man was\nforced to bear what it is terrible even to hear, in order to make him confess\nthat he had but one loaf of bread, or that he might discover a handful\nof barley-meal that was concealed; and this was done when these tormentors\nwere not themselves hungry; for the thing had been less barbarous had necessity\nforced them to it; but this was done to keep their madness in exercise,\nand as making preparation of provisions for themselves for the following\ndays. These men went also to meet those that had crept out of the city\nby night, as far as the Roman guards, to gather some plants and herbs that\ngrew wild; and when those people thought they had got clear of the enemy,\nthey snatched from them what they had brought with them, even while they\nhad frequently entreated them, and that by calling upon the tremendous\nname of God, to give them back some part of what they had brought; though\nthese would not give them the least crumb, and they were to be well contented\nthat they were only spoiled, and not slain at the same time.", "These were the afflictions which the lower sort of people suffered\nfrom these tyrants' guards; but for the men that were in dignity, and withal\nwere rich, they were carried before the tyrants themselves; some of whom\nwere falsely accused of laying treacherous plots, and so were destroyed;\nothers of them were charged with designs of betraying the city to the Romans;\nbut the readiest way of all was this, to suborn somebody to affirm that\nthey were resolved to desert to the enemy. And he who was utterly despoiled\nof what he had by Simon was sent back again to John, as of those who had\nbeen already plundered by Jotre, Simon got what remained; insomuch that\nthey drank the blood of the populace to one another, and divided the dead\nbodies of the poor creatures between them; so that although, on account\nof their ambition after dominion, they contended with each other, yet did\nthey very well agree in their wicked practices; for he that did not communicate\nwhat he got by the miseries of others to the other tyrant seemed to be\ntoo little guilty, and in one respect only; and he that did not partake\nof what was so communicated to him grieved at this, as at the loss of what\nwas a valuable thing, that he had no share in such barbarity.", "It is therefore impossible to go distinctly over every instance of\nthese men's iniquity. I shall therefore speak my mind here at once briefly:\n- That neither did any other city ever suffer such miseries, nor did any\nage ever breed a generation more fruitful in wickedness than this was,\nfrom the beginning of the world. Finally, they brought the Hebrew nation\ninto contempt, that they might themselves appear comparatively less impious\nwith regard to strangers. They confessed what was true, that they were\nthe slaves, the scum, and the spurious and abortive offspring of our nation,\nwhile they overthrew the city themselves, and forced the Romans, whether\nthey would or no, to gain a melancholy reputation, by acting gloriously\nagainst them, and did almost draw that fire upon the temple, which they\nseemed to think came too slowly; and indeed when they saw that temple burning\nfrom the upper city, they were neither troubled at it, nor did they shed\nany tears on that account, while yet these passions were discovered among\nthe Romans themselves; which circumstances we shall speak of hereafter\nin their proper place, when we come to treat of such matters.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Reland\nvery properly takes notice here, how justly this judgment came upon the\nJews, when they were crucified in such multitudes together, that the Romans\nwanted room for the crosses, and crosses for the bodies of these Jews,\nsince they had brought this judgment on themselves by the crucifixion of\ntheir Messiah."}, "#text": "SO now Titus's banks were advanced a great way, notwithstanding his\nsoldiers had been very much distressed from the wall. He then sent a party\nof horsemen, and ordered they should lay ambushes for those that went out\ninto the valleys to gather food. Some of these were indeed fighting men,\nwho were not contented with what they got by rapine; but the greater part\nof them were poor people, who were deterred from deserting by the concern\nthey were under for their own relations; for they could not hope to escape\naway, together with their wives and children, without the knowledge of\nthe seditious; nor could they think of leaving these relations to be slain\nby the robbers on their account; nay, the severity of the famine made them\nbold in thus going out; so nothing remained but that, when they were concealed\nfrom the robbers, they should be taken by the enemy; and when they were\ngoing to be taken, they were forced to defend themselves for fear of being\npunished; as after they had fought, they thought it too late to make any\nsupplications for mercy; so they were first whipped, and then tormented\nwith all sorts of tortures, before they died, and were then crucified before\nthe wall of the city. This miserable procedure made Titus greatly to pity\nthem, while they caught every day five hundred Jews; nay, some days they\ncaught more: yet it did not appear to be safe for him to let those that\nwere taken by force go their way, and to set a guard over so many he saw\nwould be to make such as great deal them useless to him. The main reason\nwhy he did not forbid that cruelty was this, that he hoped the Jews might\nperhaps yield at that sight, out of fear lest they might themselves afterwards\nbe liable to the same cruel treatment. So the soldiers, out of the wrath\nand hatred they bore the Jews, nailed those they caught, one after one\nway, and another after another, to the crosses, by way of jest, when their\nmultitude was so great, that room was wanting for the crosses, and crosses\nwanting for the bodies."}, "But so far were the seditious from repenting at this sad sight, that,\non the contrary, they made the rest of the multitude believe otherwise;\nfor they brought the relations of those that had deserted upon the wall,\nwith such of the populace as were very eager to go over upon the security\noffered them, and showed them what miseries those underwent who fled to\nthe Romans; and told them that those who were caught were supplicants to\nthem, and not such as were taken prisoners. This sight kept many of those\nwithin the city who were so eager to desert, till the truth was known;\nyet did some of them run away immediately as unto certain punishment, esteeming\ndeath from their enemies to be a quiet departure, if compared with that\nby famine. So Titus commanded that the hands of many of those that were\ncaught should be cut off, that they might not be thought deserters, and\nmight be credited on account of the calamity they were under, and sent\nthem in to John and Simon, with this exhortation, that they would now at\nlength leave off [their madness], and not force him to destroy the city,\nwhereby they would have those advantages of repentance, even in their utmost\ndistress, that they would preserve their own lives, and so find a city\nof their own, and that temple which was their peculiar. He then went round\nabout the banks that were cast up, and hastened them, in order to show\nthat his words should in no long time be followed by his deeds. In answer\nto which the seditious cast reproaches upon Caesar himself, and upon his\nfather also, and cried out, with a loud voice, that they contemned death,\nand did well in preferring it before slavery; that they would do all the\nmischief to the Romans they could while they had breath in them; and that\nfor their own city, since they were, as he said, to be destroyed, they\nhad no concern about it, and that the world itself was a better temple\nto God than this. That yet this temple would be preserved by him that inhabited\ntherein, whom they still had for their assistant in this war, and did therefore\nlaugh at all his threatenings, which would come to nothing, because the\nconclusion of the whole depended upon God only. These words were mixed\nwith reproaches, and with them they made a mighty clamor.", "In the mean time Antiochus Epiphanes came to the city, having with\nhim a considerable number of other armed men, and a band called the Macedonian\nband about him, all of the same age, tall, and just past their childhood,\narmed, and instructed after the Macedonian manner, whence it was that they\ntook that name. Yet were many of them unworthy of so famous a nation; for\nit had so happened, that the king of Commagene had flourished more than\nany other kings that were under the power of the Romans, till a change\nhappened in his condition; and when he was become an old man, he declared\nplainly that we ought not to call any man happy before he is dead. But\nthis son of his, who was then come thither before his father was decaying,\nsaid that he could not but wonder what made the Romans so tardy in making\ntheir attacks upon the wall. Now he was a warlike man, and naturally bold\nin exposing himself to dangers; he was also so strong a man, that his boldness\nseldom failed of having success. Upon this Titus smiled, and said he would\nshare the pains of an attack with him. However, Antiochus went as he then\nwas, and with his Macedonians made a sudden assault upon the wall; and,\nindeed, for his own part, his strength and skill were so great, that he\nguarded himself from the Jewish darts, and yet shot his darts at them,\nwhile yet the young men with him were almost all sorely galled; for they\nhad so great a regard to the promises that had been made of their courage,\nthat they would needs persevere in their fighting, and at length many of\nthem retired, but not till they were wounded; and then they perceived that\ntrue Macedonians, if they were to be conquerors, must have Alexander's\ngood fortune also.", "Now as the Romans began to raise their banks on the twelfth day of\nthe month Artemisius, [Jyar,] so had they much ado to finish them by the\ntwenty-ninth day of the same month, after they had labored hard for seventeen\ndays continually. For there were now four great banks raised, one of which\nwas at the tower Antonia; this was raised by the fifth legion, over against\nthe middle of that pool which was called Struthius. Another was cast up\nby the twelfth legion, at the distance of about twenty cubits from the\nother. But the labors of the tenth legion, which lay a great way off these,\nwere on the north quarter, and at the pool called Amygdalon; as was that\nof the fifteenth legion about thirty cubits from it, and at the high priest's\nmonument. And now, when the engines were brought, John had from within\nundermined the space that was over against the tower of Antonia, as far\nas the banks themselves, and had supported the ground over the mine with\nbeams laid across one another, whereby the Roman works stood upon an uncertain\nfoundation. Then did he order such materials to be brought in as were daubed\nover with pitch and bitumen, and set them on fire; and as the cross beams\nthat supported the banks were burning, the ditch yielded on the sudden,\nand the banks were shaken down, and fell into the ditch with a prodigious\nnoise. Now at the first there arose a very thick smoke and dust, as the\nfire was choked with the fall of the bank; but as the suffocated materials\nwere now gradually consumed, a plain flame brake out; on which sudden appearance\nof the flame a consternation fell upon the Romans, and the shrewdness of\nthe contrivance discouraged them; and indeed this accident coming upon\nthem at a time when they thought they had already gained their point, cooled\ntheir hopes for the time to come. They also thought it would be to no purpose\nto take the pains to extinguish the fire, since if it were extinguished,\nthe banks were swallowed up already [and become useless to them].", "Two days after this, Simon and his party made an attempt to destroy\nthe other banks; for the Romans had brought their engines to bear there,\nand began already to make the wall shake. And here one Tephtheus, of Garsis,\na city of Galilee, and Megassarus, one who was derived from some of queen\nMariamne's servants, and with them one from Adiabene, he was the son of\nNabateus, and called by the name of Chagiras, from the ill fortune he had,\nthe word signifying \"a lame man,\" snatched some torches, and\nran suddenly upon the engines. Nor were there during this war any men that\never sallied out of the city who were their superiors, either in their\nboldness, or in the terror they struck into their enemies. For they ran\nout upon the Romans, not as if they were enemies, but friends, without\nfear or delay; nor did they leave their enemies till they had rushed violently\nthrough the midst of them, and set their machines on fire. And though they\nhad darts thrown at them on every side, and were on every side assaulted\nwith their enemies' swords, yet did they not withdraw themselves out of\nthe dangers they were in, till the fire had caught hold of the instruments;\nbut when the flame went up, the Romans came running from their camp to\nsave their engines. Then did the Jews hinder their succors from the wall,\nand fought with those that endeavored to quench the fire, without any regard\nto the danger their bodies were in. So the Romans pulled the engines out\nof the fire, while the hurdles that covered them were on fire; but the\nJews caught hold of the battering rams through the flame itself, and held\nthem fast, although the iron upon them was become red hot; and now the\nfire spread itself from the engines to the banks, and prevented those that\ncame to defend them; and all this while the Romans were encompassed round\nabout with the flame; and, despairing of saying their works from it, they\nretired to their camp. Then did the Jews become still more and more in\nnumber by the coming of those that were within the city to their assistance;\nand as they were very bold upon the good success they had had, their violent\nassaults were almost irresistible; nay, they proceeded as far as the fortifications\nof the enemies' camp, and fought with their guards. Now there stood a body\nof soldiers in array before that camp, which succeeded one another by turns\nin their armor; and as to those, the law of the Romans was terrible, that\nhe who left his post there, let the occasion be whatsoever it might be,\nhe was to die for it; so that body of soldiers, preferring rather to die\nin fighting courageously, than as a punishment for their cowardice, stood\nfirm; and at the necessity these men were in of standing to it, many of\nthe others that had run away, out of shame, turned back again; and when\nthey had set the engines against the wall, they put the multitude from\ncoming more of them out of the city, [which they could the more easily\ndo] because they had made no provision for preserving or guarding their\nbodies at this time; for the Jews fought now hand to hand with all that\ncame in their way, and, without any caution, fell against the points of\ntheir enemies' spears, and attacked them bodies against bodies; for they\nwere now too hard for the Romans, not so much by their other warlike actions,\nas by these courageous assaults they made upon them; and the Romans gave\nway more to their boldness than they did to the sense of the harm they\nhad received from them.", "And now Titus was come from the tower of Antonia, whither he was\ngone to look out for a place for raising other banks, and reproached the\nsoldiers greatly for permitting their own walls to be in danger, when they\nhad taken the wails of their enemies, and sustained the fortune of men\nbesieged, while the Jews were allowed to sally out against them, though\nthey were already in a sort of prison. He then went round about the enemy\nwith some chosen troops, and fell upon their flank himself; so the Jews,\nwho had been before assaulted in their faces, wheeled about to Titus, and\ncontinued the fight. The armies also were now mixed one among another,\nand the dust that was raised so far hindered them from seeing one another,\nand the noise that was made so far hindered them from hearing one another,\nthat neither side could discern an enemy from a friend. However, the Jews\ndid not flinch, though not so much from their real strength, as from their\ndespair of deliverance. The Romans also would not yield, by reason of the\nregard they had to glory, and to their reputation in war, and because Caesar\nhimself went into the danger before them; insomuch that I cannot but think\nthe Romans would in the conclusion have now taken even the whole multitude\nof the Jews, so very angry were they at them, had these not prevented the\nupshot of the battle, and retired into the city. However, seeing the banks\nof the Romans were demolished, these Romans were very much east down upon\nthe loss of what had cost them so long pains, and this in one hour's time.\nAnd many indeed despaired of taking the city with their usual engines of\nwar only.", "AND now did Titus consult with his commanders what was to be done.\nThose that were of the warmest tempers thought he should bring the whole\narmy against the city and storm the wall; for that hitherto no more than\na part of their army had fought with the Jews; but that in case the entire\narmy was to come at once, they would not be able to sustain their attacks,\nbut would be overwhelmed by their darts. But of those that were for a more\ncautious management, some were for raising their banks again; and others\nadvised to let the banks alone, but to lie still before the city, to guard\nagainst the coming out of the Jews, and against their carrying provisions\ninto the city, and so to leave the enemy to the famine, and this without\ndirect fighting with them; for that despair was not to be conquered, especially\nas to those who are desirous to die by the sword, while a more terrible\nmisery than that is reserved for them. However, Titus did not think it\nfit for so great an army to lie entirely idle, and that yet it was in vain\nto fight with those that would be destroyed one by another; he also showed\nthem how impracticable it was to cast up any more banks, for want of materials,\nand to guard against the Jews coming out still more impracticable; as also,\nthat to encompass the whole city round with his army was not very easy,\nby reason of its magnitude, and the difficulty of the situation, and on\nother accounts dangerous, upon the sallies the Jews might make out of the\ncity. For although they might guard the known passages out of the place,\nyet would they, when they found themselves under the greatest distress,\ncontrive secret passages out, as being well acquainted with all such places;\nand if any provisions were carried in by stealth, the siege would thereby\nbe longer delayed. He also owned that he was afraid that the length of\ntime thus to be spent would diminish the glory of his success; for though\nit be true that length of time will perfect every thing, yet that to do\nwhat we do in a little time is still necessary to the gaining reputation.\nThat therefore his opinion was, that if they aimed at quickness joined\nwith security, they must build a wall round about the whole city; which\nwas, he thought, the only way to prevent the Jews from coming out any way,\nand that then they would either entirely despair of saving the city, and\nso would surrender it up to him, or be still the more easily conquered\nwhen the famine had further weakened them; for that besides this wall,\nhe would not lie entirely at rest afterward, but would take care then to\nhave banks raised again, when those that would oppose them were become\nweaker. But that if any one should think such a work to be too great, and\nnot to be finished without much difficulty, he ought to consider that it\nis not fit for Romans to undertake any small work, and that none but God\nhimself could with ease accomplish any great thing whatsoever.", "These arguments prevailed with the commanders. So Titus gave orders\nthat the army should be distributed to their several shares of this work;\nand indeed there now came upon the soldiers a certain divine fury, so that\nthey did not only part the whole wall that was to be built among them,\nnor did only one legion strive with another, but the lesser divisions of\nthe army did the same; insomuch that each soldier was ambitious to please\nhis decurion, each decurion his centurion, each centurion his tribune,\nand the ambition of the tribunes was to please their superior commanders,\nwhile Caesar himself took notice of and rewarded the like contention in\nthose commanders; for he went round about the works many times every day,\nand took a view of what was done. Titus began the wall from the camp of\nthe Assyrians, where his own camp was pitched, and drew it down to the\nlower parts of Cenopolis; thence it went along the valley of Cedron, to\nthe Mount of Olives; it then bent towards the south, and encompassed the\nmountain as far as the rock called Peristereon, and that other hill which\nlies next it, and is over the valley which reaches to Siloam; whence it\nbended again to the west, and went down to the valley of the Fountain,\nbeyond which it went up again at the monument of Ananus the high priest,\nand encompassing that mountain where Pompey had formerly pitched his camp,\nit returned back to the north side of the city, and was carried on as far\nas a certain village called \"The House of the Erebinthi;\" after\nwhich it encompassed Herod's monument, and there, on the east, was joined\nto Titus's own camp, where it began. Now the length of this wall was forty\nfurlongs, one only abated. Now at this wall without were erected thirteen\nplaces to keep garrison in, whose circumferences, put together, amounted\nto ten furlongs; the whole was completed in three days; so that what would\nnaturally have required some months was done in so short an interval as\nis incredible. When Titus had therefore encompassed the city with this\nwall, and put garrisons into proper places, be went round the wall, at\nthe first watch of the night, and observed how the guard was kept; the\nsecond watch he allotted to Alexander; the commanders of legions took the\nthird watch. They also cast lots among themselves who should be upon the\nwatch in the night time, and who should go all night long round the spaces\nthat were interposed between the garrisons.", "So all hope of escaping was now cut off from the Jews, together with\ntheir liberty of going out of the city. Then did the famine widen its progress,\nand devoured the people by whole houses and families; the upper rooms were\nfull of women and children that were dying by famine, and the lanes of\nthe city were full of the dead bodies of the aged; the children also and\nthe young men wandered about the market-places like shadows, all swelled\nwith the famine, and fell down dead, wheresoever their misery seized them.\nAs for burying them, those that were sick themselves were not able to do\nit; and those that were hearty and well were deterred from doing it by\nthe great multitude of those dead bodies, and by the uncertainty there\nwas how soon they should die themselves; for many died as they were burying\nothers, and many went to their coffins before that fatal hour was come.\nNor was there any lamentations made under these calamities, nor were heard\nany mournful complaints; but the famine confounded all natural passions;\nfor those who were just going to die looked upon those that were gone to\nrest before them with dry eyes and open mouths. A deep silence also, and\na kind of deadly night, had seized upon the city; while yet the robbers\nwere still more terrible than these miseries were themselves; for they\nbrake open those houses which were no other than graves of dead bodies,\nand plundered them of what they had; and carrying off the coverings of\ntheir bodies, went out laughing, and tried the points of their swords in\ntheir dead bodies; and, in order to prove what metal they were made of\nthey thrust some of those through that still lay alive upon the ground;\nbut for those that entreated them to lend them their right hand and their\nsword to despatch them, they were too proud to grant their requests, and\nleft them to be consumed by the famine. Now every one of these died with\ntheir eyes fixed upon the temple, and left the seditious alive behind them.\nNow the seditious at first gave orders that the dead should be buried out\nof the public treasury, as not enduring the stench of their dead bodies.\nBut afterwards, when they could not do that, they had them cast down from\nthe walls into the valleys beneath.", "However, when Titus, in going his rounds along those valleys, saw\nthem full of dead bodies, and the thick putrefaction running about them,\nhe gave a groan; and, spreading out his hands to heaven, called God to\nwitness that this was not his doing; and such was the sad case of the city\nitself. But the Romans were very joyful, since none of the seditious could\nnow make sallies out of the city, because they were themselves disconsolate,\nand the famine already touched them also. These Romans besides had great\nplenty of corn and other necessaries out of Syria, and out of the neighboring\nprovinces; many of whom would stand near to the wall of the city, and show\nthe people what great quantities of provisions they had, and so make the\nenemy more sensible of their famine, by the great plenty, even to satiety,\nwhich they had themselves. However, when the seditious still showed no\ninclinations of yielding, Titus, out of his commiseration of the people\nthat remained, and out of his earnest desire of rescuing what was still\nleft out of these miseries, began to raise his banks again, although materials\nfor them were hard to he come at; for all the trees that were about the\ncity had been already cut down for the making of the former banks. Yet\ndid the soldiers bring with them other materials from the distance of ninety\nfurlongs, and thereby raised banks in four parts, much greater than the\nformer, though this was done only at the tower of Antonia. So Caesar went\nhis rounds through the legions, and hastened on the works, and showed the\nrobbers that they were now in his hands. But these men, and these only,\nwere incapable of repenting of the wickednesses they had been guilty of;\nand separating their souls from their bodies, they used them both as if\nthey belonged to other folks, and not to themselves. For no gentle affection\ncould touch their souls, nor could any pain affect their bodies, since\nthey could still tear the dead bodies of the people as dogs do, and fill\nthe prisons with those that were sick.", "ACCORDINGLY Simon would not suffer Matthias, by whose means he got\npossession of the city, to go off without torment. This Matthias was the\nson of Boethus, and was one of the high priests, one that had been very\nfaithful to the people, and in great esteem with them; he, when the multitude\nwere distressed by the zealots, among whom John was numbered, persuaded\nthe people to admit this Simon to come in to assist them, while he had\nmade no terms with him, nor expected any thing that was evil from him.\nBut when Simon was come in, and had gotten the city under his power, he\nesteemed him that had advised them to admit him as his enemy equally with\nthe rest, as looking upon that advice as a piece of his simplicity only;\nso he had him then brought before him, and condemned to die for being on\nthe side of the Romans, without giving him leave to make his defense. He\ncondemned also his three sons to die with him; for as to the fourth, he\nprevented him by running away to Titus before. And when he begged for this,\nthat he might be slain before his sons, and that as a favor, on account\nthat he had procured the gates of the city to be opened to him, he gave\norder that he should be slain the last of them all; so he was not slain\ntill he had seen his sons slain before his eyes, and that by being produced\nover against the Romans; for such a charge had Simon given to Artanus,\nthe son of Bamadus, who was the most barbarous of all his guards. He also\njested upon him, and told him that he might now see whether those to whom\nhe intended to go over would send him any succors or not; but still he\nforbade their dead bodies should be buried. After the slaughter of these,\na certain priest, Ananias, the son of Masambalus, a person of eminency,\nas also Aristens, the scribe of the sanhedrim, and born at Emmaus, and\nwith them fifteen men of figure among the people, were slain. They also\nkept Josephus's father in prison, and made public proclamation, that no\ncitizen whosoever should either speak to him himself, or go into his company\namong others, for fear he should betray them. They also slew such as joined\nin lamenting these men, without any further examination.", "Now when Judas, the son of Judas, who was one of Simon's under officers,\nand a person intrusted by him to keep one of the towers, saw this procedure\nof Simon, he called together ten of those under him, that were most faithful\nto him, (perhaps this was done partly out of pity to those that had so\nbarbarously been put to death, but principally in order to provide for\nhis own safety,) and spoke thus to them: \"How long shall we bear these\nmiseries? or what hopes have we of deliverance by thus continuing faithful\nto such wicked wretches? Is not the famine already come against us? Are\nnot the Romans in a manner gotten within the city? Is not Simon become\nunfaithful to his benefactors? and is there not reason to fear he will\nvery soon bring us to the like punishment, while the security the Romans\noffer us is sure? Come on, let us surrender up this wall, and save ourselves\nand the city. Nor will Simon be very much hurt, if, now he despairs of\ndeliverance, he be brought to justice a little sooner than he thinks on.\"\nNow these ten were prevailed upon by those arguments; so he sent the rest\nof those that were under him, some one way, and some another, that no discovery\nmight be made of what they had resolved upon. Accordingly, he called to\nthe Romans from the tower about the third hour; but they, some of them\nout of pride, despised what he said, and others of them did not believe\nhim to be in earnest, though the greatest number delayed the matter, as\nbelieving they should get possession of the city in a little time, without\nany hazard. But when Titus was just coming thither with his armed men,\nSimon was acquainted with the matter before he came, and presently took\nthe tower into his own custody, before it was surrendered, and seized upon\nthese men, and put them to death in the sight of the Romans themselves;\nand when he had mangled their dead bodies, he threw them down before the\nwall of the city.", "In the mean time, Josephus, as he was going round the city, had his\nhead wounded by a stone that was thrown at him; upon which he fell down\nas giddy. Upon which fall of his the Jews made a sally, and he had been\nhurried away into the city, if Caesar had not sent men to protect him immediately;\nand as these men were fighting, Josephus was taken up, though he heard\nlittle of what was done. So the seditious supposed they had now slain that\nman whom they were the most desirous of killing, and made thereupon a great\nnoise, in way of rejoicing. This accident was told in the city, and the\nmultitude that remained became very disconsolate at the news, as being\npersuaded that he was really dead, on whose account alone they could venture\nto desert to the Romans. But when Josephus's mother heard in prison that\nher son was dead, she said to those that watched about her, That she had\nalways been of opinion, since the siege of Jotapata, [that he would be\nslain,] and she should never enjoy him alive any more. She also made great\nlamentation privately to the maid-servants that were about her, and said,\nThat this was all the advantage she had of bringing so extraordinary a\nperson as this son into the world; that she should not be able even to\nbury that son of hers, by whom she expected to have been buried herself.\nHowever, this false report did not put his mother to pain, nor afford merriment\nto the robbers, long; for Josephus soon recovered of his wound, and came\nout, and cried out aloud, That it would not be long ere they should be\npunished for this wound they had given him. He also made a fresh exhortation\nto the people to come out upon the security that would be given them. This\nsight of Josephus encouraged the people greatly, and brought a great consternation\nupon the seditious.", "Hereupon some of the deserters, having no other way, leaped down\nfrom the wall immediately, while others of them went out of the city with\nstones, as if they would fight them; but thereupon they fled away to the\nRomans. But here a worse fate accompanied these than what they had found\nwithin the city; and they met with a quicker despatch from the too great\nabundance they had among the Romans, than they could have done from the\nfamine among the Jews; for when they came first to the Romans, they were\npuffed up by the famine, and swelled like men in a dropsy; after which\nthey all on the sudden overfilled those bodies that were before empty,\nand so burst asunder, excepting such only as were skillful enough to restrain\ntheir appetites, and by degrees took in their food into bodies unaccustomed\nthereto. Yet did another plague seize upon those that were thus preserved;\nfor there was found among the Syrian deserters a certain person who was\ncaught gathering pieces of gold out of the excrements of the Jews' bellies;\nfor the deserters used to swallow such pieces of gold, as we told you before,\nwhen they came out, and for these did the seditious search them all; for\nthere was a great quantity of gold in the city, insomuch that as much was\nnow sold [in the Roman camp] for twelve Attic [drams], as was sold before\nfor twenty-five. But when this contrivance was discovered in one instance,\nthe fame of it filled their several camps, that the deserters came to them\nfull of gold. So the multitude of the Arabians, with the Syrians, cut up\nthose that came as supplicants, and searched their bellies. Nor does it\nseem to me that any misery befell the Jews that was more terrible than\nthis, since in one night's time about two thousand of these deserters were\nthus dissected.", "When Titus came to the knowledge of this wicked practice, he had\nlike to have surrounded those that had been guilty of it with his horse,\nand have shot them dead; and he had done it, had not their number been\nso very great, and those that were liable to this punishment would have\nbeen manifold more than those whom they had slain. However, he called together\nthe commanders of the auxiliary troops he had with him, as well as the\ncommanders of the Roman legions, (for some of his own soldiers had been\nalso guilty herein, as he had been informed,) and had great indignation\nagainst both sorts of them, and said to them, \"What! have any of my\nown soldiers done such things as this out of the uncertain hope of gain,\nwithout regarding their own weapons, which are made of silver and gold?\nMoreover, do the Arabians and Syrians now first of all begin to govern\nthemselves as they please, and to indulge their appetites in a foreign\nwar, and then, out of their barbarity in murdering men, and out of their\nhatred to the Jews, get it ascribed to the Romans?\" for this infamous\npractice was said to be spread among some of his own soldiers also. Titus\nthen threatened that he would put such men to death, if any of them were\ndiscovered to be so insolent as to do so again; moreover, he gave it in\ncharge to the legions, that they should make a search after such as were\nsuspected, and should bring them to him. But it appeared that the love\nof money was too hard for all their dread of punishment, and a vehement\ndesire of gain is natural to men, and no passion is so venturesome as covetousness;\notherwise such passions have certain bounds, and are subordinate to fear.\nBut in reality it was God who condemned the whole nation, and turned every\ncourse that was taken for their preservation to their destruction. This,\ntherefore, which was forbidden by Caesar under such a threatening, was\nventured upon privately against the deserters, and these barbarians would\ngo out still, and meet those that ran away before any saw them, and looking\nabout them to see that no Roman spied them, they dissected them, and pulled\nthis polluted money out of their bowels; which money was still found in\na few of them, while yet a great many were destroyed by the bare hope there\nwas of thus getting by them, which miserable treatment made many that were\ndeserting to return back again into the city.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Josephus,\nboth here and before, B.

And here I cannot\nbut speak my mind, and what the concern I am under dictates to me, and\nit is this: I suppose, that had the Romans made any longer delay in coming\nagainst these villains, that the city would either have been swallowed\nup by the ground opening upon them, or been overflowed by water, or else\nbeen destroyed by such thunder as the country of Sodom \nperished by, for it had brought forth a generation of men much more atheistical\nthan were those that suffered such punishments; for by their madness it\nwas that all the people came to be destroyed."}, "And, indeed, why do I relate these particular calamities? while Manneus,\nthe son of Lazarus, came running to Titus at this very time, and told him\nthat there had been carried out through that one gate, which was intrusted\nto his care, no fewer than a hundred and fifteen thousand eight hundred\nand eighty dead bodies, in the interval between the fourteenth day of the\nmonth Xanthieus, [Nisan,] when the Romans pitched their camp by the city,\nand the first day of the month Panemus [Tamuz]. This was itself a prodigious\nmultitude; and though this man was not himself set as a governor at that\ngate, yet was he appointed to pay the public stipend for carrying these\nbodies out, and so was obliged of necessity to number them, while the rest\nwere buried by their relations; though all their burial was but this, to\nbring them away, and cast them out of the city. After this man there ran\naway to Titus many of the eminent citizens, and told him the entire number\nof the poor that were dead, and that no fewer than six hundred thousand\nwere thrown out at the gates, though still the number of the rest could\nnot be discovered; and they told him further, that when they were no longer\nable to carry out the dead bodies of the poor, they laid their corpses\non heaps in very large houses, and shut them up therein; as also that a\nmedimnus of wheat was sold for a talent; and that when, a while afterward,\nit was not possible to gather herbs, by reason the city was all walled\nabout, some persons were driven to that terrible distress as to search\nthe common sewers and old dunghills of cattle, and to eat the dung which\nthey got there; and what they of old could not endure so much as to see\nthey now used for food. When the Romans barely heard all this, they commiserated\ntheir case; while the seditious, who saw it also, did not repent, but suffered\nthe same distress to come upon themselves; for they were blinded by that\nfate which was already coming upon the city, and upon themselves also."]}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "6", "head": "Book VI", "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "sum", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "CONTAINING THE INTERVAL OF ABOUT ONE MONTH.\nFROM THE GREAT EXTREMITY TO WHICH THE JEWS WERE REDUCED TO\nTHE TAKING OF JERUSALEM BY TITUS."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "sum", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "THAT THE MISERIES STILL GREW WORSE; AND HOW THE ROMANS MADE\nAN ASSAULT UPON THE TOWER OF ANTONIA."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "sum", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "HOW TITUS GAVE ORDERS TO DEMOLISH THE TOWER OF ANTONIA AND\nTHEN PERSUADED JOSEPHUS TO EXHORT THE JEWS AGAIN [TO A SURRENDER]."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "sum", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "CONCERNING A STRATAGEM THAT WAS DEVISED BY THE JEWS, BY WHICH\nTHEY BURNT MANY OF THE ROMANS; WITH ANOTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE TERRIBLE\nFAMINE THAT WAS IN THE CITY."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "sum", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "WHEN THE BANKS WERE COMPLETED AND THE BATTERING RAMS BROUGHT,\nAND COULD DO NOTHING, TITUS GAVE ORDERS TO SET FIRE TO THE GATES OF THE\nTEMPLE; IN NO LONG TIME AFTER WHICH THE HOLY HOUSE ITSELF WAS BURNT DOWN,\nEVEN AGAINST HIS CONSENT."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "sum", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "THE GREAT DISTRESS THE JEWS WERE IN UPON THE CONFLAGRATION\nOF THE HOLY HOUSE.

And indeed the multitude of carcasses that lay in heaps\none upon another was a horrible sight, and produced a pestilential stench,\nwhich was a hinderance to those that would make sallies out of the city,\nand fight the enemy: but as those were to go in battle-array, who had been\nalready used to ten thousand murders, and must tread upon those dead bodies\nas they marched along, so were not they terrified, nor did they pity men\nas they marched over them; nor did they deem this affront offered to the\ndeceased to be any ill omen to themselves; but as they had their right\nhands already polluted with the murders of their own countrymen, and in\nthat condition ran out to fight with foreigners, they seem to me to have\ncast a reproach upon God himself, as if he were too slow in punishing them;\nfor the war was not now gone on with as if they had any hope of victory;\nfor they gloried after a brutish manner in that despair of deliverance\nthey were already in. And now the Romans, although they were greatly distressed\nin getting together their materials, raised their banks in one and twenty\ndays, after they had cut down all the trees that were in the country that\nadjoined to the city, and that for ninety furlongs round about, as I have\nalready related. And truly the very view itself of the country was a melancholy\nthing; for those places which were before adorned with trees and pleasant\ngardens were now become a desolate country every way, and its trees were\nall cut down: nor could any foreigner that had formerly seen Judea and\nthe most beautiful suburbs of the city, and now saw it as a desert, but\nlament and mourn sadly at so great a change: for the war had laid all the\nsigns of beauty quite waste: nor if any one that had known the place before,\nhad come on a sudden to it now, would he have known it again; but though\nhe were at the city itself, yet would he have inquired for it notwithstanding.", "And now the banks were finished, they afforded a foundation for fear\nboth to the Romans and to the Jews; for the Jews expected that the city\nwould be taken, unless they could burn those banks, as did the Romans expect\nthat, if these were once burnt down, they should never be able to take\nit; for there was a mighty scarcity of materials, and the bodies of the\nsoldiers began to fail with such hard labors, as did their souls faint\nwith so many instances of ill success; nay, the very calamities themselves\nthat were in the city proved a greater discouragement to the Romans than\nthose within the city; for they found the fighting men of the Jews to be\nnot at all mollified among such their sore afflictions, while they had\nthemselves perpetually less and less hopes of success, and their banks\nwere forced to yield to the stratagems of the enemy, their engines to the\nfirmness of their wall, and their closest fights to the boldness of their\nattack; and, what was their greatest discouragement of all, they found\nthe Jews' courageous souls to be superior to the multitude of the miseries\nthey were under, by their sedition, their famine, and the war itself; insomuch\nthat they were ready to imagine that the violence of their attacks was\ninvincible, and that the alacrity they showed would not be discouraged\nby their calamities; for what would not those be able to bear if they should\nbe fortunate, who turned their very misfortunes to the improvement of their\nvalor! These considerations made the Romans to keep a stronger guard about\ntheir banks than they formerly had done.", "But now John and his party took care for securing themselves afterward,\neven in case this wall should be thrown down, and fell to their work before\nthe battering rams were brought against them. Yet did they not compass\nwhat they endeavored to do, but as they were gone out with their torches,\nthey came back under great discouragement before they came near to the\nbanks; and the reasons were these: that, in the first place, their conduct\ndid not seem to be unanimous, but they went out in distinct parties, and\nat distinct intervals, and after a slow manner, and timorously, and, to\nsay all in a word, without a Jewish courage; for they were now defective\nin what is peculiar to our nation, that is, in boldness, in violence of\nassault, and in running upon the enemy all together, and in persevering\nin what they go about, though they do not at first succeed in it; but they\nnow went out in a more languid manner than usual, and at the same time\nfound the Romans set in array, and more courageous than ordinary, and that\nthey guarded their banks both with their bodies and their entire armor,\nand this to such a degree on all sides, that they left no room for the\nfire to get among them, and that every one of their souls was in such good\ncourage, that they would sooner die than desert their ranks; for besides\ntheir notion that all their hopes were cut off, in case these their works\nwere once burnt, the soldiers were greatly ashamed that subtlety should\nquite be too hard for courage, madness for armor, multitude for skill,\nand Jews for Romans. The Romans had now also another advantage, in that\ntheir engines for sieges co-operated with them in throwing darts and stones\nas far as the Jews, when they were coming out of the city; whereby the\nman that fell became an impediment to him that was next to him, as did\nthe danger of going farther make them less zealous in their attempts; and\nfor those that had run under the darts, some of them were terrified by\nthe good order and closeness of the enemies' ranks before they came to\na close fight, and others were pricked with their spears, and turned back\nagain; at length they reproached one another for their cowardice, and retired\nwithout doing any thing. This attack was made upon the first day of the\nmonth Panemus [Tamuz.] So when the Jews were retreated, the Romans brought\ntheir engines, although they had all the while stones thrown at them from\nthe tower of Antonia, and were assaulted by fire and sword, and by all\nsorts of darts, which necessity afforded the Jews to make use of; for although\nthese had great dependence on their own wall, and a contempt of the Roman\nengines, yet did they endeavor to hinder the Romans from bringing them.\nNow these Romans struggled hard, on the contrary, to bring them, as deeming\nthat this zeal of the Jews was in order to avoid any impression to be made\non the tower of Antonia, because its wall was but weak, and its foundations\nrotten. However, that tower did not yield to the blows given it from the\nengines; yet did the Romans bear the impressions made by the enemies' darts\nwhich were perpetually cast at them, and did not give way to any of those\ndangers that came upon them from above, and so they brought their engines\nto bear. But then, as they were beneath the other, and were sadly wounded\nby the stones thrown down upon them, some of them threw their shields over\ntheir bodies, and partly with their hands, and partly with their bodies,\nand partly with crows, they undermined its foundations, and with great\npains they removed four of its stones. Then night came upon both sides,\nand put an end to this struggle for the present; however, that night the\nwall was so shaken by the battering rams in that place where John had used\nhis stratagem before, and had undermined their banks, that the ground then\ngave way, and the wall fell down suddenly.", "When this accident had unexpectedly happened, the minds of both parties\nwere variously affected; for though one would expect that the Jews would\nbe discouraged, because this fall of their wall was unexpected by them,\nand they had made no provision in that case, yet did they pull up their\ncourage, because the tower of Antonia itself was still standing; as was\nthe unexpected joy of the Romans at this fall of the wall soon quenched\nby the sight they had of another wall, which John and his party had built\nwithin it. However, the attack of this second wall appeared to be easier\nthan that of the former, because it seemed a thing of greater facility\nto get up to it through the parts of the former wall that were now thrown\ndown. This new wall appeared also to be much weaker than the tower of Antonia,\nand accordingly the Romans imagined that it had been erected so much on\nthe sudden, that they should soon overthrow it: yet did not any body venture\nnow to go up to this wall; for that such as first ventured so to do must\ncertainly be killed.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Reland\nnotes here, very pertinently, that the tower of Antonia stood higher than\nthe floor of the temple or court adjoining to it; and that accordingly\nthey descended thence into the temple, as Josephus elsewhere speaks also.\nSee Book VI. ch. 2. sect. 5."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "In\nthis speech of Titus we may clearly see the notions which the Romans then\nhad of death, and of the happy state of those who died bravely in war,\nand the contrary estate of those who died ignobly in their beds by sickness.\nReland here also produces two parallel passages, the one out of Atonia\nJanus Marcellinus, concerning the Alani, lib. 31, that \"they judged\nthat man happy who laid down his life in battle ;\" the other of Valerius\nMaximus, lib. 11. ch. 6, who says, \"that the Cimbri and Celtiberi\nexulted for joy in the army, as being to go out of the world gloriously\nand happily.\""}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "See\nthe note on p. 809."}], "#text": "And now Titus, upon consideration that the alacrity of soldiers in\nwar is chiefly excited by hopes and by good words, and that exhortations\nand promises do frequently make men to forget the hazards they run, nay,\nsometimes to despise death itself, got together the most courageous part\nof his army, and tried what he could do with his men by these methods.\n\"O fellow soldiers,\" said he, \"to make an exhortation to\nmen to do what hath no peril in it, is on that very account inglorious\nto such to whom that exhortation is made; and indeed so it is in him that\nmakes the exhortation, an argument of his own cowardice also. I therefore\nthink that such exhortations ought then only to be made use of when affairs\nare in a dangerous condition, and yet are worthy of being attempted by\nevery one themselves; accordingly, I am fully of the same opinion with\nyou, that it is a difficult task to go up this wall; but that it is proper\nfor those that desire reputation for their valor to struggle with difficulties\nin such cases will then appear, when I have particularly shown that it\nis a brave thing to die with glory, and that the courage here necessary\nshall not go unrewarded in those that first begin the attempt. And let\nmy first argument to move you to it be taken from what probably some would\nthink reasonable to dissuade you, I mean the constancy and patience of\nthese Jews, even under their ill successes; for it is unbecoming you, who\nare Romans and my soldiers, who have in peace been taught how to make wars,\nand who have also been used to conquer in those wars, to be inferior to\nJews, either in action of the hand, or in courage of the soul, and this\nespecially when you are at the conclusion of your victory, and are assisted\nby God himself; for as to our misfortunes, they have been owing to the\nmadness of the Jews, while their sufferings have been owing to your valor,\nand to the assistance God hath afforded you; for as to the seditions they\nhave been in, and the famine they are under, and the siege they now endure,\nand the fall of their walls without our engines, what can they all be but\ndemonstrations of God's anger against them, and of his assistance afforded\nus? It will not therefore be proper for you, either to show yourselves\ninferior to those to whom you are really superior, or to betray that Divine\nassistance which is afforded you. And, indeed, how can it be esteemed otherwise\nthan a base and unworthy thing, that while the Jews, who need not be much\nashamed if they be deserted, because they have long learned to be slaves\nto others, do yet despise death, that they may be so no longer; and do\nmake sallies into the very midst of us frequently, no in hopes of conquering\nus, but merely for a demonstration of their courage; we, who have gotten\npossession of almost all the world that belongs to either land or sea,\nto whom it will be a great shame if we do not conquer them, do not once\nundertake any attempt against our enemies wherein there is much danger,\nbut sit still idle, with such brave arms as we have, and only wait till\nthe famine and fortune do our business themselves, and this when we have\nit in our power, with some small hazard, to gain all that we desire! For\nif we go up to this tower of Antonia, we gain the city; for if there should\nbe any more occasion for fighting against those within the city, which\nI do not suppose there will, since we shall then be upon the top of the\nhill \nand be upon our enemies before they can have taken breath, these advantages\npromise us no less than a certain and sudden victory. As for myself, I\nshall at present wave any commendation of those who die in war, \nand omit to speak of the immortality of those men who are slain in the\nmidst of their martial bravery; yet cannot I forbear to imprecate upon\nthose who are of a contrary disposition, that they may die in time of peace,\nby some distemper or other, since their souls are condemned to the grave,\ntogether with their bodies. For what man of virtue is there who does not\nknow, that those souls which are severed from their fleshly bodies in battles\nby the sword are received by the ether, that purest of elements, and joined\nto that company which are placed among the stars; that they become good\ndemons, and propitious heroes, and show themselves as such to their posterity\nafterwards? while upon those souls that wear away in and with their distempered\nbodies comes a subterranean night to dissolve them to nothing, and a deep\noblivion to take away all the remembrance of them, and this notwithstanding\nthey be clean from all spots and defilements of this world; so that, in\nthis ease, the soul at the same time comes to the utmost bounds of its\nlife, and of its body, and of its memorial also. But since he hath determined\nthat death is to come of necessity upon all men, a sword is a better instrument\nfor that purpose than any disease whatsoever. Why is it not then a very\nmean thing for us not to yield up that to the public benefit which we must\nyield up to fate? And this discourse have I made, upon the supposition\nthat those who at first attempt to go upon this wall must needs be killed\nin the attempt, though still men of true courage have a chance to escape\neven in the most hazardous undertakings. For, in the first place, that\npart of the former wall that is thrown down is easily to be ascended; and\nfor the new-built wall, it is easily destroyed. Do you, therefore, many\nof you, pull up your courage, and set about this work, and do you mutually\nencourage and assist one another; and this your bravery will soon break\nthe hearts of your enemies; and perhaps such a glorious undertaking as\nyours is may be accomplished without bloodshed. For although it be justly\nto be supposed that the Jews will try to hinder you at your first beginning\nto go up to them; yet when you have once concealed yourselves from them,\nand driven them away by force, they will not be able to sustain your efforts\nagainst them any longer, though but a few of you prevent them, and get\nover the wall. As for that person who first mounts the wall, I should blush\nfor shame if I did not make him to be envied of others, by those rewards\nI would bestow upon him. If such a one escape with his life, he shall have\nthe command of others that are now but his equals; although it be true\nalso that the greatest rewards will accrue to such as die in the attempt.\""}, "Upon this speech of Titus, the rest of the multitude were aftrighted\nat so great a danger. But there was one, whose name was Sabinus, a soldier\nthat served among the cohorts, and a Syrian by birth, who appeared to be\nof very great fortitude, both in the actions he had done, and the courage\nof his soul he had shown; although any body would have thought, before\nhe came to his work, that he was of such a weak constitution of body, that\nhe was not fit to be a soldier; for his color was black, his flesh was\nlean and thin, and lay close together; but there was a certain heroic soul\nthat dwelt in this small body, which body was indeed much too narrow for\nthat peculiar courage which was in him. Accordingly he was the first that\nrose up, when he thus spake: \"I readily surrender up myself to thee,\nO Caesar; I first ascend the wall, and I heartily wish that my fortune\nmay follow my courage and my resolution And if some ill fortune grudge\nme the success of my undertaking, take notice that my ill success will\nnot be unexpected, but that I choose death voluntarily for thy sake.\"\nWhen he had said this, and had spread out his sheild over his head with\nhis left hand, and hill, with his right hand, drawn his sword, he marched\nup to the wall, just about the sixth hour of the day. There followed him\neleven others, and no more, that resolved to imitate his bravery; but still\nthis was the principal person of them all, and went first, as excited by\na divine fury. Now those that guarded the wall shot at them from thence,\nand cast innumerable darts upon them from every side; they also rolled\nvery large stones upon them, which overthrew some of those eleven that\nwere with him. But as for Sabinus himself, he met the darts that were cast\nat him and though he was overwhelmed with them, yet did he not leave off\nthe violence of his attack before he had gotten up on the top of the wall,\nand had put the enemy to flight. For as the Jews were astonished at his\ngreat strength, and the bravery of his soul, and as, withal, they imagined\nmore of them had got upon the wall than really had, they were put to flight.\nAnd now one cannot but complain here of fortune, as still envious at virtue,\nand always hindering the performance of glorious achievements: this was\nthe case of the man before us, when he had just obtained his purpose; for\nhe then stumbled at a certain large stone, and fell down upon it headlong,\nwith a very great noise. Upon which the Jews turned back, and when they\nsaw him to be alone, and fallen down also, they threw darts at him from\nevery side. However. be got upon his knee, and covered himself with his\nshield, and at the first defended himself against them, and wounded many\nof those that came near him; but he was soon forced to relax his right\nhand, by the multitude of the wounds that had been given him, till at length\nhe was quite covered over with darts before he gave up the ghost. He was\none who deserved a better fate, by reason of his bravery; but, as might\nbe expected, he fell under so vast an attempt. As for the rest of his partners,\nthe Jews dashed three of them to pieces with stones, and slew them as they\nwere gotten up to the top of the wall; the other eight being wounded, were\npulled down, and carried back to the camp. These things were done upon\nthe third day of the month Panemus [Tamuz].", "Now two days afterward twelve of those men that were on the forefront,\nand kept watch upon the banks, got together, and called to them the standard-bearer\nof the fifth legion, and two others of a troop of horsemen, and one trumpeter;\nthese went without noise, about the ninth hour of the night, through the\nruins, to the tower of Antonia; and when they had cut the throats of the\nfirst guards of the place, as they were asleep, they got possession of\nthe wall, and ordered the trumpeter to sound his trumpet. Upon which the\nrest of the guard got up on the sudden, and ran away, before any body could\nsee how many they were that were gotten up; for, partly from the fear they\nwere in, and partly from the sound of the trumpet which they heard, they\nimagined a great number of the enemy were gotten up. But as soon as Caesar\nheard the signal, he ordered the army to put on their armor immediately,\nand came thither with his commanders, and first of all ascended, as did\nthe chosen men that were with him. And as the Jews were flying away to\nthe temple, they fell into that mine which John had dug under the Roman\nbanks. Then did the seditious of both the bodies of the Jewish army, as\nwell that belonging to John as that belonging to Simon, drive them away;\nand indeed were no way wanting as to the highest degree of force and alacrity;\nfor they esteemed themselves entirely ruined if once the Romans got into\nthe temple, as did the Romans look upon the same thing as the beginning\nof their entire conquest. So a terrible battle was fought at the entrance\nof the temple, while the Romans were forcing their way, in order to get\npossession of that temple, and the Jews were driving them back to the tower\nof Antonia; in which battle the darts were on both sides useless, as well\nas the spears, and both sides drew their swords, and fought it out hand\nto hand. Now during this struggle the positions of the men were undistinguished\non both sides, and they fought at random, the men being intermixed one\nwith another, and confounded, by reason of the narrowness of the place;\nwhile the noise that was made fell on the ear after an indistinct manner,\nbecause it was so very loud. Great slaughter was now made on both sides,\nand the combatants trod upon the bodies and the armor of those that were\ndead, and dashed them to pieces. Accordingly, to which side soever the\nbattle inclined, those that had the advantage exhorted one another to go\non, as did those that were beaten make great lamentation. But still there\nwas no room for flight, nor for pursuit, but disorderly revolutions and\nretreats, while the armies were intermixed one with another; but those\nthat were in the first ranks were under the necessity of killing or being\nkilled, without any way for escaping; for those on both sides that came\nbehind forced those before them to go on, without leaving any space between\nthe armies. At length the Jews' violent zeal was too hard for the Romans'\nskill, and the battle already inclined entirely that way; for the fight\nhad lasted from the ninth hour of the night till the seventh hour of the\nday, While the Jews came on in crowds, and had the danger the temple was\nin for their motive; the Romans having no more here than a part of their\narmy; for those legions, on which the soldiers on that side depended, were\nnot come up to them. So it was at present thought sufficient by the Romans\nto take possession of the tower of Antonia.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "No\nwonder that this Julian, who had so many nails in his shoes, slipped upon\nthe pavement of the temple, which was smooth, and laid with marble of different\ncolors."}, "#text": "But there was one Julian, a centurion, that came from Eithynia, a\nman he was of great reputation, whom I had formerly seen in that war, and\none of the highest fame, both for his skill in war, his strength of body,\nand the courage of his soul. This man, seeing the Romans giving ground,\nand ill a sad condition, (for he stood by Titus at the tower of Antonia,)\nleaped out, and of himself alone put the Jews to flight, when they were\nalready conquerors, and made them retire as far as the corner of the inner\ncourt of the temple; from him the multitude fled away in crowds, as supposing\nthat neither his strength nor his violent attacks could be those of a mere\nman. Accordingly, he rushed through the midst of the Jews, as they were\ndispersed all abroad, and killed those that he caught. Nor, indeed, was\nthere any sight that appeared more wonderful in the eyes of Caesar, or\nmore terrible to others, than this. However, he was himself pursued by\nfate, which it all not possible that he, who was but a mortal man, should\nescape; for as he had shoes all full of thick and sharp nails \nas had every one of the other soldiers, so when he ran on the pavement\nof the temple, he slipped, and fell down upon his back with a very great\nnoise, which was made by his armor. This made those that were running away\nto turn back; whereupon those Romans that were in the tower of Antonia\nset up a great shout, as they were in fear for the man. But the Jews got\nabout him in crowds, and struck at him with their spears and with their\nswords on all sides. Now he received a great many of the strokes of these\niron weapons upon his shield, and often attempted to get up again, but\nwas thrown down by those that struck at him; yet did he, as he lay along,\nstab many of them with his sword. Nor was he soon killed, as being covered\nwith his helmet and his breastplate in all those parts of his body where\nhe might be mortally wounded; he also pulled his neck close to his body,\ntill all his other limbs were shattered, and nobody durst come to defend\nhim, and then he yielded to his fate. Now Caesar was deeply affected on\naccount of this man of so great fortitude, and especially as he was killed\nin the sight of so many people; he was desirous himself to come to his\nassistance, but the place would not give him leave, while such as could\nhave done it were too much terrified to attempt it. Thus when Julian had\nstruggled with death a great while, and had let but few of those that had\ngiven him his mortal wound go off unhurt, he had at last his throat cut,\nthough not without some difficulty, and left behind him a very great fame,\nnot only among the Romans, and with Caesar himself, but among his enemies\nalso; then did the Jews catch up his dead body, and put the Romans to flight\nagain, and shut them up in the tower of Antonia. Now those that most signalized\nthemselves, and fought most zealously in this battle of the Jewish side,\nwere one Alexas and Gyphtheus, of John's party, and of Simon's party were\nMalachias, and Judas the son of Merto, and James the son of Sosas, the\ncommander of the Idumeans; and of the zealots, two brethren, Simon and\nJudas, the sons of Jairus."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "date": {"@value": "66", "#text": "66"}, "#text": "This\nwas a remarkable day indeed, the seventeenth of Paneruns.

Upon this Josephus stood in such a place where he might\nbe heard, not by John only, but by many more, and then declared to them\nwhat Caesar had given him in charge, and this in the Hebrew language. \nSo he earnestly prayed them to spare their own city, and to prevent that\nfire which was just ready to seize upon the temple, and to offer their\nusual sacrifices to God therein. At these words of his a great sadness\nand silence were observed among the people. But the tyrant himself cast\nmany reproaches upon Josephus, with imprecations besides; and at last added\nthis withal, that he did never fear the taking of the city, because it\nwas God's own city. In answer to which Josephus said thus with a loud voice:\n\"To be sure thou hast kept this city wonderfully pure for God's sake;\nthe temple also continues entirely unpolluted! Nor hast thou been guilty\nof ally impiety against him for whose assistance thou hopest! He still\nreceives his accustomed sacrifices! Vile wretch that thou art! if any one\nshould deprive thee of thy daily food, thou wouldst esteem him to be an\nenemy to thee; but thou hopest to have that God for thy supporter in this\nwar whom thou hast deprived of his everlasting worship; and thou imputest\nthose sins to the Romans, who to this very time take care to have our laws\nobserved, and almost compel these sacrifices to be still offered to God,\nwhich have by thy means been intermitted! Who is there that can avoid groans\nand lamentations at the amazing change that is made in this city? since\nvery foreigners and enemies do now correct that impiety which thou hast\noccasioned; while thou, who art a Jew, and wast educated in our laws, art\nbecome a greater enemy to them than the others. But still, John, it is\nnever dishonorable to repent, and amend what hath been done amiss, even\nat the last extremity. Thou hast an instance before thee in Jechoniah,\n the king\nof the Jews, if thou hast a mind to save the city, who, when the king of\nBabylon made war against him, did of his own accord go out of this city\nbefore it was taken, and did undergo a voluntary captivity with his family,\nthat the sanctuary might not be delivered up to the enemy, and that he\nmight not see the house of God set on fire; on which account he is celebrated\namong all the Jews, in their sacred memorials, and his memory is become\nimmortal, and will be conveyed fresh down to our posterity through all\nages. This, John, is an excellent example in such a time of danger, and\nI dare venture to promise that the Romans shall still forgive thee. And\ntake notice that I, who make this exhortation to thee, am one of thine\nown nation; I, who am a Jew, do make this promise to thee. And it will\nbecome thee to consider who I am that give thee this counsel, and whence\nI am derived; for while I am alive I shall never be in such slavery, as\nto forego my own kindred, or forget the laws of our forefathers.

Now Caesar not only received\nthese men very kindly in other respects, but, knowing they would not willingly\nlive after the customs of other nations, he sent them to Gophna, and desired\nthem to remain there for the present, and told them, that when he was gotten\nclear of this war, he would restore each of them to their possessions again;\nso they cheerfully retired to that small city which was allotted them,\nwithout fear of any danger. But as they did not appear, the seditious gave\nout again that these deserters were slain by the Romans, which was done\nin order to deter the rest from running away, by fear of the like treatment.\nThis trick of theirs succeeded now for a while, as did the like trick before;\nfor the rest were hereby deterred from deserting, by fear of the like treatment."}, "However, when Titus had recalled those men from Gophna, he gave orders\nthat they should go round the wall, together with Josephus, and show themselves\nto the people; upon which a great many fled to the Romans.

Yet did the seditious still\nmore and more contradict them; and while they cast loud and bitter reproaches\nupon these deserters, they also set their engines for throwing of darts,\nand javelins, and stones upon the sacred gates of the temple, at due distances\nfrom one another, insomuch that all the space round about within the temple\nmight be compared to a burying-ground, so great was the number of the dead\nbodies therein; as might the holy house itself be compared to a citadel.\nAccordingly, these men rushed upon these holy places in their armor, that\nwere otherwise unapproachable, and that while their hands were yet warm\nwith the blood of their own people which they had shed; nay, they proceeded\nto such great transgressions, that the very same indignation which Jews\nwould naturally have against Romans, had they been guilty of such abuses\nagainst them, the Romans now had against Jews, for their impiety in regard\nto their own religious customs.

But when Titus saw that these men were neither to be moved by commiseration\ntowards themselves, nor had any concern upon them to have the holy house\nspared, he proceeded unwillingly to go on again with the war against them.\nHe could not indeed bring all his army against them, the place was so narrow;\nbut choosing thirty soldiers of the most valiant out of every hundred,\nand committing a thousand to each tribune, and making Cerealis their commander-in-chief,\nhe gave orders that they should attack the guards of the temple about the\nninth hour of that night. But as he was now in his armor, and preparing\nto go down with them, his friends would not let him go, by reason of the\ngreatness of the danger, and what the commanders suggested to them; for\nthey said that he would do more by sitting above in the tower of Antonia,\nas a dispenser of rewards to those soldiers that signalized themselves\nin the fight, than by coming down and hazarding his own person in the forefront\nof them; for that they would all fight stoutly while Caesar looked upon\nthem. With this advice Caesar complied, and said that the only reason he\nhad for such compliance with the soldiers was this, that he might be able\nto judge of their courageous actions, and that no valiant soldier might\nlie concealed, and miss of his reward, and no cowardly soldier might go\nunpunished; but that he might himself be an eye-witness, and able to give\nevidence of all that was done, who was to be the disposer of punishments\nand rewards to them. So he sent the soldiers about their work at the hour\nforementioned, while he went out himself to a higher place in the tower\nof Antonia, whence he might see what was done, and there waited with impatience\nto see the event.", "However, the soldiers that were sent did not find the guards of the\ntemple asleep, as they hoped to have done; but were obliged to fight with\nthem immediately hand to hand, as they rushed with violence upon them with\na great shout. Now as soon as the rest within the temple heard that shout\nof those that were upon the watch, they ran out in troops upon them. Then\ndid the Romans receive the onset of those that came first upon them; but\nthose that followed them fell upon their own troops, and many of them treated\ntheir own soldiers as if they had been enemies; for the great confused\nnoise that was made on both sides hindered them from distinguishing one\nanother's voices, as did the darkness of the night hinder them from the\nlike distinction by the sight, besides that blindness which arose otherwise\nalso from the passion and the fear they were in at the same time; for which\nreason it was all one to the soldiers who it was they struck at. However,\nthis ignorance did less harm to the Romans than to the Jews, because they\nwere joined together under their shields, and made their sallies more regularly\nthan the others did, and each of them remembered their watch-word; while\nthe Jews were perpetually dispersed abroad, and made their attacks and\nretreats at random, and so did frequently seem to one another to be enemies;\nfor every one of them received those of their own men that came back in\nthe dark as Romans, and made an assault upon them; so that more of them\nwere wounded by their own men than by the enemy, till, upon the coming\non of the day, the nature of the right was discerned by the eye afterward.\nThen did they stand in battle-array in distinct bodies, and cast their\ndarts regularly, and regularly defended themselves; nor did either side\nyield or grow weary. The Romans contended with each other who should fight\nthe most strenuously, both single men and entire regiments, as being under\nthe eye of Titus; and every one concluded that this day would begin his\npromotion if he fought bravely. What were the great encouragements of the\nJews to act vigorously were, their fear for themselves and for the temple,\nand the presence of their tyrant, who exhorted some, and beat and threatened\nothers, to act courageously. Now, it so happened, that this fight was for\nthe most part a stationary one, wherein the soldiers went on and came back\nin a short time, and suddenly; for there was no long space of ground for\neither of their flights or pursuits. But still there was a tumultuous noise\namong the Romans from the tower of Antonia, who loudly cried out upon all\noccasions to their own men to press on courageously, when they were too\nhard for the Jews, and to stay when they were retiring backward; so that\nhere was a kind of theater of war; for what was done in this fight could\nnot be concealed either from Titus, or from those that were about him.\nAt length it appeared that this fight, which began at the ninth hour of\nthe night, was not over till past the fifth hour of the day; and that,\nin the same place where the battle began, neither party could say they\nhad made the other to retire; but both the armies left the victory almost\nin uncertainty between them; wherein those that signalized themselves on\nthe Roman side were a great many, but on the Jewish side, and of those\nthat were with Simon, Judas the son of Merto, and Simon the son of Josas;\nof the Idumeans, James and Simon, the latter of whom was the son of Cathlas,\nand James was the son of Sosas; of those that were with John, Gyphtheus\nand Alexas; and of the zealots, Simon the son of Jairus.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Court of the Gentiles."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Court of Israel."}], "#text": "In the mean time, the rest of the Roman army had, in seven days'\ntime, overthrown [some] foundations of the tower of Antonia, and had made\na ready and broad way to the temple. Then did the legions come near the\nfirst court, \nand began to raise their banks. The one bank was over against the north-west\ncorner of the inner temple \nanother was at that northern edifice which was between the two gates; and\nof the other two, one was at the western cloister of the outer court of\nthe temple; the other against its northern cloister. However, these works\nwere thus far advanced by the Romans, not without great pains and difficulty,\nand particularly by being obliged to bring their materials from the distance\nof a hundred furlongs. They had further difficulties also upon them; sometimes\nby their over-great security they were in that they should overcome the\nJewish snares laid for them, and by that boldness of the Jews which their\ndespair of escaping had inspired them withal; for some of their horsemen,\nwhen they went out to gather wood or hay, let their horses feed without\nhaving their bridles on during the time of foraging; upon which horses\nthe Jews sallied out in whole bodies, and seized them. And when this was\ncontinually done, and Caesar believed what the truth was, that the horses\nwere stolen more by the negligence of his own men than by the valor of\nthe Jews, he determined to use greater severity to oblige the rest to take\ncare of their horses; so he commanded that one of those soldiers who had\nlost their horses should be capitally punished; whereby he so terrified\nthe rest, that they preserved their horses for the time to come; for they\ndid not any longer let them go from them to feed by themselves, but, as\nif they had grown to them, they went always along with them when they wanted\nnecessaries. Thus did the Romans still continue to make war against the\ntemple, and to raise their banks against it."}, "Now after one day had been interposed since the Romans ascended the\nbreach, many of the seditious were so pressed by the famine, upon the present\nfailure of their ravages, that they got together, and made an attack on\nthose Roman guards that were upon the Mount of Olives, and this about the\neleventh hour of the day, as supposing, first, that they would not expect\nsuch an onset, and, in the next place, that they were then taking care\nof their bodies, and that therefore they should easily beat them. But the\nRomans were apprized of their coming to attack them beforehand, and, running\ntogether from the neighboring camps on the sudden, prevented them from\ngetting over their fortification, or forcing the wall that was built about\nthem. Upon this came on a sharp fight, and here many great actions were\nperformed on both sides; while the Romans showed both their courage and\ntheir skill in war, as did the Jews come on them with immoderate violence\nand intolerable passion. The one part were urged on by shame, and the other\nby necessity; for it seemed a very shameful thing to the Romans to let\nthe Jews go, now they were taken in a kind of net; while the Jews had but\none hope of saving themselves, and that was in case they could by violence\nbreak through the Roman wall; and one whose name was Pedanius, belonging\nto a party of horsemen, when the Jews were already beaten and forced down\ninto the valley together, spurred his horse on their flank with great vehemence,\nand caught up a certain young man belonging to the enemy by his ankle,\nas he was running away; the man was, however, of a robust body, and in\nhis armor; so low did Pedanius bend himself downward from his horse, even\nas he was galloping away, and so great was the strength of his right hand,\nand of the rest of his body, as also such skill had he in horsemanship.\nSo this man seized upon that his prey, as upon a precious treasure, and\ncarried him as his captive to Caesar; whereupon Titus admired the man that\nhad seized the other for his great strength, and ordered the man that was\ncaught to be punished [with death] for his attempt against the Roman wall,\nbut betook himself to the siege of the temple, and to pressing on the raising\nof the banks.", "In the mean time, the Jews were so distressed by the fights they\nhad been in, as the war advanced higher and higher, and creeping up to\nthe holy house itself, that they, as it were, cut off those limbs of their\nbody which were infected, in order to prevent the distemper's spreading\nfurther; for they set the north-west cloister, which was joined to the\ntower of Antonia, on fire, and after that brake off about twenty cubits\nof that cloister, and thereby made a beginning in burning the sanctuary;\ntwo days after which, or on the twenty-fourth day of the forenamed month,\n[Panemus or Tamuz,] the Romans set fire to the cloister that joined to\nthe other, when the fire went fifteen cubits farther. The Jews, in like\nmanner, cut off its roof; nor did they entirely leave off what they were\nabout till the tower of Antonia was parted from the temple, even when it\nwas in their power to have stopped the fire; nay, they lay still while\nthe temple was first set on fire, and deemed this spreading of the fire\nto be for their own advantage. However, the armies were still fighting\none against another about the temple, and the war was managed by continual\nsallies of particular parties against one another.", "Now there was at this time a man among the Jews, low of stature\nhe was, and of a despicable appearance; of no character either as to his\nfamily, or in other respects: his flame was Jonathan. He went out at the\nhigh priest John's monument, and uttered many other insolent things to\nthe Romans, a challenged the best of them all to a single combat.But many\nof those that stood there in the army huffed him, and many of them (as\nthey might well be) were afraid of him. Some of them also reasoned thus,\nand that justly enough: that it was not fit to fight with a man that desired\nto die, because those that utterly despaired of deliverance had, besides\nother passions, a violence in attacking men that could not be opposed,\nand had no regard to God himself; and that to hazard oneself with a person,\nwhom, if you overcome, you do no great matter, and by whom it is hazardous\nthat you may be taken prisoner, would be an instance, not of manly courage,\nbut of unmanly rashness. So there being nobody that came out to accept\nthe man's challenge, and the Jew cutting them with a great number of reproaches,\nas cowards, (for he was a very haughty man in himself, and a great despiser\nof the Romans,) one whose name was Pudens, of the body of horsemen, out\nof his abomination of the other's words, and of his impudence withal, and\nperhaps out of an inconsiderate arrogance, on account of the other's lowness\nof stature, ran out to him, and was too hard for him in other respects,\nbut was betrayed by his ill fortune; for he fell down, and as he was down,\nJonathan came running to him, and cut his throat, and then, standing upon\nhis dead body, he brandished his sword, bloody as it was, and shook his\nshield with his left hand, and made many acclamations to the Roman army,\nand exulted over the dead man, and jested upon the Romans; till at length\none Priscus, a centurion, shot a dart at him as he was leaping and playing\nthe fool with himself, and thereby pierced him through; upon which a shout\nwas set up both by the Jews and the Romans, though on different accounts.\nSo Jonathan grew giddy by the pain of his wounds, and fell down upon the\nbody of his adversary, as a plain instance how suddenly vengeance may come\nupon men that have success in war, without any just deserving the same.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Of the court of the Gentiles."}, "#text": "BUT now the seditious that were in the temple did every day openly\nendeavor to beat off the soldiers that were upon the banks, and on the\ntwenty-seventh day of the forenamed month [Panemus or Tamuz] contrived\nsuch a stratagem as this: They filled that part of the western cloister\n which\nwas between the beams, and the roof under them, with dry materials, as\nalso with bitumen and pitch, and then retired from that place, as though\nthey were tired with the pains they had taken; at which procedure of theirs,\nmany of the most inconsiderate among the Romans, who were carried away\nwith violent passions, followed hard after them as they were retiring,\nand applied ladders to the cloister, and got up to it suddenly; but the\nprudent part of them, when they understood this unaccountable retreat of\nthe Jews, stood still where they were before. However, the cloister was\nfull of those that were gone up the ladders; at which time the Jews set\nit all on fire; and as the flame burst out every where on the sudden, the\nRomans that were out of the danger were seized with a very great consternation,\nas were those that were in the midst of the danger in the utmost distress.\nSo when they perceived themselves surrounded with the flames, some of them\nthrew themselves down backwards into the city, and some among their enemies\n[in the temple]; as did many leap down to their own men, and broke their\nlimbs to pieces; but a great number of those that were going to take these\nviolent methods were prevented by the fire; though some prevented the fire\nby their own swords. However, the fire was on the sudden carried so far\nas to surround those who would have otherwise perished. As for Caesar himself,\nhe could not, however, but commiserate those that thus perished, although\nthey got up thither without any order for so doing, since there was no\nway of giving the many relief. Yet was this some comfort to those that\nwere destroyed, that every body might see that person grieve, for whose\nsake they came to their end; for he cried out openly to them, and leaped\nup, and exhorted those that were about him to do their utmost to relieve\nthem; So every one of them died cheerfully, as carrying along with him\nthese words and this intention of Caesar as a sepulchral monument. Some\nthere were indeed who retired into the wall of the cloister, which was\nbroad, and were preserved out of the fire, but were then surrounded by\nthe Jews; and although they made resistance against the Jews for a long\ntime, yet were they wounded by them, and at length they all fell down dead."}, "At the last a young man among them, whose name was Longus, became\na decoration to this sad affair, and while every one of them that perished\nwere worthy of a memorial, this man appeared to deserve it beyond all the\nrest. Now the Jews admired this man for his courage, and were further desirous\nof having him slain; so they persuaded him to come down to them, upon security\ngiven him for his life. But Cornelius his brother persuaded him on the\ncontrary, not to tarnish his own glory, nor that of the Roman army. He\ncomplied with this last advice, and lifting up his sword before both armies,\nhe slew himself. Yet there was one Artorius among those surrounded by the\nfire who escaped by his subtlety; for when he had with a loud voice called\nto him Lucius, one of his fellow soldiers that lay with him in the same\ntent, and said to him, \"I do leave thee heir of all I have, if thou\nwilt come and receive me.\" Upon this he came running to receive him\nreadily; Artorius then threw himself down upon him, and saved his own life,\nwhile he that received him was dashed so vehemently against the stone pavement\nby the other's weight, that he died immediately. This melancholy accident\nmade the Romans sad for a while, but still it made them more upon their\nguard for the future, and was of advantage to them against the delusions\nof the Jews, by which they were greatly damaged through their unacquaintedness\nwith the places, and with the nature of the inhabitants. Now this cloister\nwas burnt down as far as John's tower, which he built in the war he made\nagainst Simon over the gates that led to the Xystus. The Jews also cut\noff the rest of that cloister from the temple, after they had destroyed\nthose that got up to it. But the next day the Romans burnt down the northern\ncloister entirely, as far as the east cloister, whose common angle joined\nto the valley that was called Cedron, and was built over it; on which account\nthe depth was frightful.

She then attempted a most\nunnatural thing; and snatching up her son, who was a child sucking at her\nbreast, she said, \"O thou miserable infant! for whom shall I preserve\nthee in this war, this famine, and this sedition? As to the war with the\nRomans, if they preserve our lives, we must be slaves. This famine also\nwill destroy us, even before that slavery comes upon us.

She replied that\nshe had saved a very fine portion of it for them, and withal uncovered\nwhat was left of her son.

Upon which the whole city was full of this horrid action\nimmediately; and while every body laid this miserable case before their\nown eyes, they trembled, as if this unheard of action had been done by\nthemselves. So those that were thus distressed by the famine were very\ndesirous to die, and those already dead were esteemed happy, because they\nhad not lived long enough either to hear or to see such miseries."}, "This sad instance was quickly told to the Romans, some of whom could\nnot believe it, and others pitied the distress which the Jews were under;\nbut there were many of them who were hereby induced to a more bitter hatred\nthan ordinary against our nation. But for Caesar, he excused himself before\nGod as to this matter, and said that he had proposed peace and liberty\nto the Jews, as well as an oblivion of all their former insolent practices;\nbut that they, instead of concord, had chosen sedition; instead of peace,\nwar; and before satiety and abundance, a famine. That they had begun with\ntheir own hands to burn down that temple which we have preserved hitherto;\nand that therefore they deserved to eat such food as this was. That, however,\nthis horrid action of eating an own child ought to be covered with the\noverthrow of their very country itself, and men ought not to leave such\na city upon the habitable earth to be seen by the sun, wherein mothers\nare thus fed, although such food be fitter for the fathers than for the\nmothers to eat of, since it is they that continue still in a state of war\nagainst us, after they have undergone such miseries as these. And at the\nsame time that he said this, he reflected on the desperate condition these\nmen must be in; nor could he expect that such men could be recovered to\nsobriety of mind, after they had endured those very sufferings, for the\navoiding whereof it only was probable they might have repented.", "AND now two of the legions had completed their banks on the eighth\nday of the month Lous [Ab]. Whereupon Titus gave orders that the battering\nrams should be brought, and set over against the western edifice of the\ninner temple; for before these were brought, the firmest of all the other\nengines had battered the wall for six days together without ceasing, without\nmaking any impression upon it; but the vast largeness and strong connexion\nof the stones were superior to that engine, and to the other battering\nrams also. Other Romans did indeed undermine the foundations of the northern\ngate, and after a world of pains removed the outermost stones, yet was\nthe gate still upheld by the inner stones, and stood still unhurt; till\nthe workmen, despairing of all such attempts by engines and crows, brought\ntheir ladders to the cloisters. Now the Jews did not interrupt them in\nso doing; but when they were gotten up, they fell upon them, and fought\nwith them; some of them they thrust down, and threw them backwards headlong;\nothers of them they met and slew; they also beat many of those that went\ndown the ladders again, and slew them with their swords before they could\nbring their shields to protect them; nay, some of the ladders they threw\ndown from above when they were full of armed men; a great slaughter was\nmade of the Jews also at the same time, while those that bare the ensigns\nfought hard for them, as deeming it a terrible thing, and what would tend\nto their great shame, if they permitted them to be stolen away. Yet did\nthe Jews at length get possession of these engines, and destroyed those\nthat had gone up the ladders, while the rest were so intimidated by what\nthose suffered who were slain, that they retired; although none of the\nRomans died without having done good service before his death. Of the seditious,\nthose that had fought bravely in the former battles did the like now, as\nbesides them did Eleazar, the brother's son of Simon the tyrant. But when\nTitus perceived that his endeavors to spare a foreign temple turned to\nthe damage of his soldiers, and then be killed, he gave order to set the\ngates on fire.", "In the mean time, there deserted to him Ananus, who came from Emmaus,\nthe most bloody of all Simon's guards, and Archelaus, the son of Magadatus,\nthey hoping to be still forgiven, because they left the Jews at a time\nwhen they were the conquerors. Titus objected this to these men, as a cunning\ntrick of theirs; and as he had been informed of their other barbarities\ntowards the Jews, he was going in all haste to have them both slain. He\ntold them that they were only driven to this desertion because of the utmost\ndistress they were in, and did not come away of their own good disposition;\nand that those did not deserve to be preserved, by whom their own city\nwas already set on fire, out of which fire they now hurried themselves\naway. However, the security he had promised deserters overcame his resentments,\nand he dismissed them accordingly, though he did not give them the same\nprivileges that he had afforded to others. And now the soldiers had already\nput fire to the gates, and the silver that was over them quickly carried\nthe flames to the wood that was within it, whence it spread itself all\non the sudden, and caught hold on the cloisters. Upon the Jews seeing this\nfire all about them, their spirits sunk together with their bodies, and\nthey were under such astonishment, that not one of them made any haste,\neither to defend himself or to quench the fire, but they stood as mute\nspectators of it only. However, they did not so grieve at the loss of what\nwas now burning, as to grow wiser thereby for the time to come; but as\nthough the holy house itself had been on fire already, they whetted their\npassions against the Romans. This fire prevailed during that day and the\nnext also; for the soldiers were not able to burn all the cloisters that\nwere round about together at one time, but only by pieces.", "But then, on the next day, Titus commanded part of his army to quench\nthe fire, and to make a road for the more easy marching up of the legions,\nwhile he himself gathered the commanders together. Of those there were\nassembled the six principal persons: Tiberius Alexander, the commander\n[under the general] of the whole army; with Sextus Cerealis, the commander\nof the fifth legion; and Larcius Lepidus, the commander of the tenth legion;\nand Titus Frigius, the commander of the fifteenth legion: there was also\nwith them Eternius, the leader of the two legions that came from Alexandria;\nand Marcus Antonius Julianus, procurator of Judea: after these came together\nall the rest of the procurators and tribunes. Titus proposed to these that\nthey should give him their advice what should be done about the holy house.\nNow some of these thought it would be the best way to act according to\nthe rules of war, [and demolish it,] because the Jews would never leave\noff rebelling while that house was standing; at which house it was that\nthey used to get all together. Others of them were of opinion, that in\ncase the Jews would leave it, and none of them would lay their arms up\nin it, he might save it; but that in case they got upon it, and fought\nany more, he might burn it; because it must then be looked upon not as\na holy house, but as a citadel; and that the impiety of burning it would\nthen belong to those that forced this to be done, and not to them. But\nTitus said, that \"although the Jews should get upon that holy house,\nand fight us thence, yet ought we not to revenge ourselves on things that\nare inanimate, instead of the men themselves;\" and that he was not\nin any case for burning down so vast a work as that was, because this would\nbe a mischief to the Romans themselves, as it would be an ornament to their\ngovernment while it continued. So Fronto, and Alexander, and Cerealis grew\nbold upon that declaration, and agreed to the opinion of Titus. Then was\nthis assembly dissolved, when Titus had given orders to the commanders\nthat the rest of their forces should lie still; but that they should make\nuse of such as were most courageous in this attack. So he commanded that\nthe chosen men that were taken out of the cohorts should make their way\nthrough the ruins, and quench the fire.", "Now it is true that on this day the Jews were so weary, and under\nsuch consternation, that they refrained from any attacks. But on the next\nday they gathered their whole force together, and ran upon those that guarded\nthe outward court of the temple very boldly, through the east gate, and\nthis about the second hour of the day. These guards received that their\nattack with great bravery, and by covering themselves with their shields\nbefore, as if it were with a wall, they drew their squadron close together;\nyet was it evident that they could not abide there very long, but would\nbe overborne by the multitude of those that sallied out upon them, and\nby the heat of their passion. However, Caesar seeing, from the tower of\nAntonia, that this squadron was likely to give way, he sent some chosen\nhorsemen to support them. Hereupon the Jews found themselves not able to\nsustain their onset, and upon the slaughter of those in the forefront,\nmany of the rest were put to flight. But as the Romans were going off,\nthe Jews turned upon them, and fought them; and as those Romans came back\nupon them, they retreated again, until about the fifth hour of the day\nthey were overborne, and shut themselves up in the inner [court of the]\ntemple.", "So Titus retired into the tower of Antonia, and resolved to storm\nthe temple the next day, early in the morning, with his whole army, and\nto encamp round about the holy house. But as for that house, God had, for\ncertain, long ago doomed it to the fire; and now that fatal day was come,\naccording to the revolution of ages; it was the tenth day of the month\nLous, [Ab,] upon which it was formerly burnt by the king of Babylon; although\nthese flames took their rise from the Jews themselves, and were occasioned\nby them; for upon Titus's retiring, the seditious lay still for a little\nwhile, and then attacked the Romans again, when those that guarded the\nholy house fought with those that quenched the fire that was burning the\ninner [court of the] temple; but these Romans put the Jews to flight, and\nproceeded as far as the holy house itself. At which time one of the soldiers,\nwithout staying for any orders, and without any concern or dread upon him\nat so great an undertaking, and being hurried on by a certain divine fury,\nsnatched somewhat out of the materials that were on fire, and being lifted\nup by another soldier, he set fire to a golden window, through which there\nwas a passage to the rooms that were round about the holy house, on the\nnorth side of it. As the flames went upward, the Jews made a great clamor,\nsuch as so mighty an affliction required, and ran together to prevent it;\nand now they spared not their lives any longer, nor suffered any thing\nto restrain their force, since that holy house was perishing, for whose\nsake it was that they kept such a guard about it.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "These steps to the altar of burnt-offering seem here either an improper\nand inaccurate expression of Josephus, since it was unlawful to make ladder\nsteps; (see description of the temples, ch. 13., and note on Antiq.

Then did Caesar, both by calling to the soldiers\nthat were fighting, with a loud voice, and by giving a signal to them with\nhis right hand, order them to quench the fire. But they did not hear what\nhe said, though he spake so loud, having their ears already dimmed by a\ngreater noise another way; nor did they attend to the signal he made with\nhis hand neither, as still some of them were distracted with fighting,\nand others with passion. But as for the legions that came running thither,\nneither any persuasions nor any threatenings could restrain their violence,\nbut each one's own passion was his commander at this time; and as they\nwere crowding into the temple together, many of them were trampled on by\none another, while a great number fell among the ruins of the cloisters,\nwhich were still hot and smoking, and were destroyed in the same miserable\nway with those whom they had conquered; and when they were come near the\nholy house, they made as if they did not so much as hear Caesar's orders\nto the contrary; but they encouraged those that were before them to set\nit on fire. As for the seditious, they were in too great distress already\nto afford their assistance [towards quenching the fire]; they were every\nwhere slain, and every where beaten; and as for a great part of the people,\nthey were weak and without arms, and had their throats cut wherever they\nwere caught. Now round about the altar lay dead bodies heaped one upon\nanother, as at the steps \ngoing up to it ran a great quantity of their blood, whither also the dead\nbodies that were slain above [on the altar] fell down."}, "And now, since Caesar was no way able to restrain the enthusiastic\nfury of the soldiers, and the fire proceeded on more and more, he went\ninto the holy place of the temple, with his commanders, and saw it, with\nwhat was in it, which he found to be far superior to what the relations\nof foreigners contained, and not inferior to what we ourselves boasted\nof and believed about it. But as the flame had not as yet reached to its\ninward parts, but was still consuming the rooms that were about the holy\nhouse, and Titus supposing what the fact was, that the house itself might\nyet he saved, he came in haste and endeavored to persuade the soldiers\nto quench the fire, and gave order to Liberalius the centurion, and one\nof those spearmen that were about him, to beat the soldiers that were refractory\nwith their staves, and to restrain them; yet were their passions too hard\nfor the regards they had for Caesar, and the dread they had of him who\nforbade them, as was their hatred of the Jews, and a certain vehement inclination\nto fight them, too hard for them also. Moreover, the hope of plunder induced\nmany to go on, as having this opinion, that all the places within were\nfull of money, and as seeing that all round about it was made of gold.\nAnd besides, one of those that went into the place prevented Caesar, when\nhe ran so hastily out to restrain the soldiers, and threw the fire upon\nthe hinges of the gate, in the dark; whereby the flame burst out from within\nthe holy house itself immediately, when the commanders retired, and Caesar\nwith them, and when nobody any longer forbade those that were without to\nset fire to it. And thus was the holy house burnt down, without Caesar's\napprobation.", "Now although any one would justly lament the destruction of such\na work as this was, since it was the most admirable of all the works that\nwe have seen or heard of, both for its curious structure and its magnitude,\nand also for the vast wealth bestowed upon it, as well as for the glorious\nreputation it had for its holiness; yet might such a one comfort himself\nwith this thought, that it was fate that decreed it so to be, which is\ninevitable, both as to living creatures, and as to works and places also.\nHowever, one cannot but wonder at the accuracy of this period thereto relating;\nfor the same month and day were now observed, as I said before, wherein\nthe holy house was burnt formerly by the Babylonians.

The flame was also\ncarried a long way, and made an echo, together with the groans of those\nthat were slain; and because this hill was high, and the works at the temple\nwere very great, one would have thought the whole city had been on fire.\nNor can one imagine any thing either greater or more terrible than this\nnoise; for there was at once a shout of the Roman legions, who were marching\nall together, and a sad clamor of the seditious, who were now surrounded\nwith fire and sword. The people also that were left above were beaten back\nupon the enemy, and under a great consternation, and made sad moans at\nthe calamity they were under; the multitude also that was in the city joined\nin this outcry with those that were upon the hill.

As for the priests, some of them plucked up from the holy house\nthe spikes \nthat were upon it, with their bases, which were made of lead, and shot\nthem at the Romans instead of darts. But then as they gained nothing by\nso doing, and as the fire burst out upon them, they retired to the wall\nthat was eight cubits broad, and there they tarried; yet did two of these\nof eminence among them, who might have saved themselves by going over to\nthe Romans, or have borne up with courage, and taken their fortune with\nthe others, throw themselves into the fire, and were burnt together with\nthe holy house; their names were Meirus the son of Belgas, and Joseph the\nson of Daleus."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Reland here takes notice, that these Jews, who had despised the true Prophet,\nwere deservedly abused and deluded by these false ones."}, "#text": "And now the Romans, judging that it was in vain to spare what was\nround about the holy house, burnt all those places, as also the remains\nof the cloisters and the gates, two excepted; the one on the east side,\nand the other on the south; both which, however, they burnt afterward.\nThey also burnt down the treasury chambers, in which was an immense quantity\nof money, and an immense number of garments, and other precious goods there\nreposited; and, to speak all in a few words, there it was that the entire\nriches of the Jews were heaped up together, while the rich people had there\nbuilt themselves chambers [to contain such furniture]. The soldiers also\ncame to the rest of the cloisters that were in the outer [court of the]\ntemple, whither the women and children, and a great mixed multitude of\nthe people, fled, in number about six thousand. But before Caesar had determined\nany thing about these people, or given the commanders any orders relating\nto them, the soldiers were in such a rage, that they set that cloister\non fire; by which means it came to pass that some of these were destroyed\nby throwing themselves down headlong, and some were burnt in the cloisters\nthemselves. Nor did any one of them escape with his life. A false prophet\n was\nthe occasion of these people's destruction, who had made a public proclamation\nin the city that very day, that God commanded them to get upon the temple,\nand that there they should receive miraculous signs of their deliverance.\nNow there was then a great number of false prophets suborned by the tyrants\nto impose on the people, who denounced this to them, that they should wait\nfor deliverance from God; and this was in order to keep them from deserting,\nand that they might be buoyed up above fear and care by such hopes. Now\na man that is in adversity does easily comply with such promises; for when\nsuch a seducer makes him believe that he shall be delivered from those\nmiseries which oppress him, then it is that the patient is full of hopes\nof such his deliverance."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Whether Josephus means that this star was different from that comet which\nlasted a whole year, I cannot certainly determine.

Thus\nthere was a star \nresembling a sword, which stood over the city, and a comet, that continued\na whole year. Thus also before the Jews' rebellion, and before those commotions\nwhich preceded the war, when the people were come in great crowds to the\nfeast of unleavened bread, on the eighth day of the month Xanthicus, \n[Nisan,] and at the ninth hour of the night, so great a light shone round\nthe altar and the holy house, that it appeared to be bright day time; which\nlasted for half an hour. This light seemed to be a good sign to the unskillful,\nbut was so interpreted by the sacred scribes, as to portend those events\nthat followed immediately upon it. At the same festival also, a heifer,\nas she was led by the high priest to be sacrificed, brought forth a lamb\nin the midst of the temple. Moreover, the eastern gate of the inner \n[court of the] temple, which was of brass, and vastly heavy, and had been\nwith difficulty shut by twenty men, and rested upon a basis armed with\niron, and had bolts fastened very deep into the firm floor, which was there\nmade of one entire stone, was seen to be opened of its own accord about\nthe sixth hour of the night. Now those that kept watch in the temple came\nhereupon running to the captain of the temple, and told him of it; who\nthen came up thither, and not without great difficulty was able to shut\nthe gate again. This also appeared to the vulgar to be a very happy prodigy,\nas if God did thereby open them the gate of happiness. But the men of learning\nunderstood it, that the security of their holy house was dissolved of its\nown accord, and that the gate was opened for the advantage of their enemies.\nSo these publicly declared that the signal foreshowed the desolation that\nwas coming upon them. Besides these, a few days after that feast, on the\none and twentieth day of the month Artemisius, [Jyar,] a certain prodigious\nand incredible phenomenon appeared: I suppose the account of it would seem\nto be a fable, were it not related by those that saw it, and were not the\nevents that followed it of so considerable a nature as to deserve such\nsignals; for, before sun-setting, chariots and troops of soldiers in their\narmor were seen running about among the clouds, and surrounding of cities.\nMoreover, at that feast which we call Pentecost, as the priests were going\nby night into the inner [court of the temple,] as their custom was, to\nperform their sacred ministrations, they said that, in the first place,\nthey felt a quaking, and heard a great noise, and after that they heard\na sound as of a great multitude, saying, \"Let us remove hence.\"\nBut, what is still more terrible, there was one Jesus, the son of Ananus,\na plebeian and a husbandman, who, four years before the war began, and\nat a time when the city was in very great peace and prosperity, came to\nthat feast whereon it is our custom for every one to make tabernacles to\nGod in the temple, \nbegan on a sudden to cry aloud, \"A voice from the east, a voice from\nthe west, a voice from the four winds, a voice against Jerusalem and the\nholy house, a voice against the bridegrooms and the brides, and a voice\nagainst this whole people!\" This was his cry, as he went about by\nday and by night, in all the lanes of the city. However, certain of the\nmost eminent among the populace had great indignation at this dire cry\nof his, and took up the man, and gave him a great number of severe stripes;\nyet did not he either say any thing for himself, or any thing peculiar\nto those that chastised him, but still went on with the same words which\nhe cried before. Hereupon our rulers, supposing, as the case proved to\nbe, that this was a sort of divine fury in the man, brought him to the\nRoman procurator, where he was whipped till his bones were laid bare; yet\nhe did not make any supplication for himself, nor shed any tears, but turning\nhis voice to the most lamentable tone possible, at every stroke of the\nwhip his answer was, \"Woe, woe to Jerusalem!\" And when Albinus\n(for he was then our procurator) asked him, Who he was? and whence he came?\nand why he uttered such words? he made no manner of reply to what he said,\nbut still did not leave off his melancholy ditty, till Albinus took him\nto be a madman, and dismissed him. Now, during all the time that passed\nbefore the war began, this man did not go near any of the citizens, nor\nwas seen by them while he said so; but he every day uttered these lamentable\nwords, as if it were his premeditated vow, \"Woe, woe to Jerusalem!\"\nNor did he give ill words to any of those that beat him every day, nor\ngood words to those that gave him food; but this was his reply to all men,\nand indeed no other than a melancholy presage of what was to come. This\ncry of his was the loudest at the festivals; and he continued this ditty\nfor seven years and five months, without growing hoarse, or being tired\ntherewith, until the very time that he saw his presage in earnest fulfilled\nin our siege, when it ceased; for as he was going round upon the wall,\nhe cried out with his utmost force, \"Woe, woe to the city again, and\nto the people, and to the holy house!\" And just as he added at the\nlast, \"Woe, woe to myself also!\" there came a stone out of one\nof the engines, and smote him, and killed him immediately; and as he was\nuttering the very same presages he gave up the ghost."}, "Now if any one consider these things, he will find that God takes\ncare of mankind, and by all ways possible foreshows to our race what is\nfor their preservation; but that men perish by those miseries which they\nmadly and voluntarily bring upon themselves; for the Jews, by demolishing\nthe tower of Antonia, had made their temple four-square, while at the same\ntime they had it written in their sacred oracles, \"That then should\ntheir city be taken, as well as their holy house, when once their temple\nshould become four-square.\" But now, what did the most elevate them\nin undertaking this war, was an ambiguous oracle that was also found in\ntheir sacred writings, how,\" about that time, one from their country\nshould become governor of the habitable earth.\" The Jews took this\nprediction to belong to themselves in particular, and many of the wise\nmen were thereby deceived in their determination.

So Titus charged his soldiers to restrain their rage,\nand to let their darts alone, and appointed an interpreter between them,\nwhich was a sign that he was the conqueror, and first began the discourse,\nand said, \"I hope you, sirs, are now satiated with the miseries of\nyour country, who have not bad any just notions, either of our great power,\nor of your own great weakness, but have, like madmen, after a violent and\ninconsiderate manner, made such attempts, as have brought your people,\nyour city, and your holy house to destruction. You have been the men that\nhave never left off rebelling since Pompey first conquered you, and have,\nsince that time, made open war with the Romans. Have you depended on your\nmultitude, while a very small part of the Roman soldiery have been strong\nenough for you? Have you relied on the fidelity of your confederates? And\nwhat nations are there, out of the limits of our dominion, that would choose\nto assist the Jews before the Romans? Are your bodies stronger than ours?\nnay, you know that the [strong] Germans themselves are our servants. Have\nyou stronger walls than we have? Pray, what greater obstacle is there than\nthe wall of the ocean, with which the Britons are encompassed, and yet\ndo adore the arms of the Romans. Do you exceed us in courage of soul, and\nin the sagacity of your commanders? Nay, indeed, you cannot but know that\nthe very Carthaginians have been conquered by us. It can therefore be nothing\ncertainly but the kindness of us Romans which hath excited you against\nus; who, in the first place, have given you this land to possess; and,\nin the next place, have set over you kings of your own nation; and, in\nthe third place, have preserved the laws of your forefathers to you, and\nhave withal permitted you to live, either by yourselves, or among others,\nas it should please you: and, what is our chief favor of all we have given\nyou leave to gather up that tribute which is paid to God \nwith such other gifts that are dedicated to him; nor have we called those\nthat carried these donations to account, nor prohibited them; till at length\nyou became richer than we ourselves, even when you were our enemies; and\nyou made preparations for war against us with our own money; nay, after\nall, when you were in the enjoyment of all these advantages, you turned\nyour too great plenty against those that gave it you, and, like merciless\nserpents, have thrown out your poison against those that treated you kindly.\nI suppose, therefore, that you might despise the slothfulness of Nero,\nand, like limbs of the body that are broken or dislocated, you did then\nlie quiet, waiting for some other time, though still with a malicious intention,\nand have now showed your distemper to be greater than ever, and have extended\nyour desires as far as your impudent and immense hopes would enable you\nto do it. At this time my father came into this country, not with a design\nto punish you for what you had done under Cestius, but to admonish you;\nfor had he come to overthrow your nation, he had run directly to your fountain-head,\nand had immediately laid this city waste; whereas he went and burnt Galilee\nand the neighboring parts, and thereby gave you time for repentance; which\ninstance of humanity you took for an argument of his weakness, and nourished\nup your impudence by our mildness. When Nero was gone out of the world,\nyou did as the wickedest wretches would have done, and encouraged yourselves\nto act against us by our civil dissensions, and abused that time, when\nboth I and my father were gone away to Egypt, to make preparations for\nthis war. Nor were you ashamed to raise disturbances against us when we\nwere made emperors, and this while you had experienced how mild we had\nbeen, when we were no more than generals of the army. But when the government\nwas devolved upon us, and all other people did thereupon lie quiet, and\neven foreign nations sent embassies, and congratulated our access to the\ngovernment, then did you Jews show yourselves to be our enemies. You sent\nembassies to those of your nation that are beyond Euphrates to assist you\nin your raising disturbances; new walls were built by you round your city,\nseditions arose, and one tyrant contended against another, and a civil\nwar broke out among you; such indeed as became none but so wicked a people\nas you are. I then came to this city, as unwillingly sent by my father,\nand received melancholy injunctions from him. When I heard that the people\nwere disposed to peace, I rejoiced at it; I exhorted you to leave off these\nproceedings before I began this war; I spared you even when you had fought\nagainst me a great while; I gave my right hand as security to the deserters;\nI observed what I had promised faithfully. When they fled to me, I had\ncompassion on many of those that I had taken captive; I tortured those\nthat were eager for war, in order to restrain them. It was unwillingly\nthat I brought my engines of war against your walls; I always prohibited\nmy soldiers, when they were set upon your slaughter, from their severity\nagainst you. After every victory I persuaded you to peace, as though I\nhad been myself conquered. When I came near your temple, I again departed\nfrom the laws of war, and exhorted you to spare your own sanctuary, and\nto preserve your holy house to yourselves. I allowed you a quiet exit out\nof it, and security for your preservation; nay, if you had a mind, I gave\nyou leave to fight in another place. Yet have you still despised every\none of my proposals, and have set fire to your holy house with your own\nhands. And now, vile wretches, do you desire to treat with me by word of\nmouth? To what purpose is it that you would save such a holy house as this\nwas, which is now destroyed? What preservation can you now desire after\nthe destruction of your temple? Yet do you stand still at this very time\nin your armor; nor can you bring yourselves so much as to pretend to be\nsupplicants even in this your utmost extremity. O miserable creatures!\nwhat is it you depend on? Are not your people dead? is not your holy house\ngone? is not your city in my power? and are not your own very lives in\nmy hands? And do you still deem it a part of valor to die? However, I will\nnot imitate your madness. If you throw down your arms, and deliver up your\nbodies to me, I grant you your lives; and I will act like a mild master\nof a family; what cannot be healed shall be punished, and the rest I will\npreserve for my own use.\""}, "To that offer of Titus they made this reply: That they could not\naccept of it, because they had sworn never to do so; but they desired they\nmight have leave to go through the wall that had been made about them,\nwith their wives and children; for that they would go into the desert,\nand leave the city to him. At this Titus had great indignation, that when\nthey were in the case of men already taken captives, they should pretend\nto make their own terms with him, as if they had been conquerors. So he\nordered this proclamation to be made to them, That they should no more\ncome out to him as deserters, nor hope for any further security; for that\nhe would henceforth spare nobody, but fight them with his whole army; and\nthat they must save themselves as well as they could; for that he would\nfrom henceforth treat them according to the laws of war. So he gave orders\nto the soldiers both to burn and to plunder the city; who did nothing indeed\nthat day; but on the next day they set fire to the repository of the archives,\nto Acra, to the council-house, and to the place called Ophlas; at which\ntime the fire proceeded as far as the palace of queen Helena, which was\nin the middle of Acra; the lanes also were burnt down, as were also those\nhouses that were full of the dead bodies of such as were destroyed by famine.", "On the same day it was that the sons and brethren of Izates the king,\ntogether with many others of the eminent men of the populace, got together\nthere, and besought Caesar to give them his right hand for their security;\nupon which, though he was very angry at all that were now remaining, yet\ndid he not lay aside his old moderation, but received these men. At that\ntime, indeed, he kept them all in custody, but still bound the king's sons\nand kinsmen, and led them with him to Rome, in order to make them hostages\nfor their country's fidelity to the Romans.", "AND now the seditious rushed into the royal palace, into which many\nhad put their effects, because it was so strong, and drove the Romans away\nfrom it. They also slew all the people that had crowded into it, who were\nin number about eight thousand four hundred, and plundered them of what\nthey had. They also took two of the Romans alive; the one was a horseman,\nand the other a footman. They then cut the throat of the footman, and immediately\nhad him drawn through the whole city, as revenging themselves upon the\nwhole body of the Romans by this one instance. But the horseman said he\nhad somewhat to suggest to them in order to their preservation; whereupon\nhe was brought before Simon; but he having nothing to say when he was there,\nhe was delivered to Ardalas, one of his commanders, to be punished, who\nbound his hands behind him, and put a riband over his eyes, and then brought\nhim out over against the Romans, as intending to cut off his head. But\nthe man prevented that execution, and ran away to the Romans, and this\nwhile the Jewish executioner was drawing out his sword. Now when he was\ngotten away from the enemy, Titus could not think of putting him to death;\nbut because he deemed him unworthy of being a Roman soldier any longer,\non account that he had been taken alive by the enemy, he took away his\narms, and ejected him out of the legion whereto he had belonged; which,\nto one that had a sense of shame, was a penalty severer than death itself.", "On the next day the Romans drove the robbers out of the lower city,\nand set all on fire as far as Siloam. These soldiers were indeed glad to\nsee the city destroyed. But they missed the plunder, because the seditious\nhad carried off all their effects, and were retired into the upper city;\nfor they did not yet at all repent of the mischiefs they had done, but\nwere insolent, as if they had done well; for, as they saw the city on fire,\nthey appeared cheerful, and put on joyful countenances, in expectation,\nas they said, of death to end their miseries. Accordingly, as the people\nwere now slain, the holy house was burnt down, and the city was on fire,\nthere was nothing further left for the enemy to do. Yet did not Josephus\ngrow weary, even in this utmost extremity, to beg of them to spare what\nwas left of the city; he spake largely to them about their barbarity and\nimpiety, and gave them his advice in order to their escape; though he gained\nnothing thereby more than to be laughed at by them; and as they could not\nthink of surrendering themselves up, because of the oath they had taken,\nnor were strong enough to fight with the Romans any longer upon the square,\nas being surrounded on all sides, and a kind of prisoners already, yet\nwere they so accustomed to kill people, that they could not restrain their\nright hands from acting accordingly. So they dispersed themselves before\nthe city, and laid themselves in ambush among its ruins, to catch those\nthat attempted to desert to the Romans; accordingly many such deserters\nwere caught by them, and were all slain; for these were too weak, by reason\nof their want of food, to fly away from them; so their dead bodies were\nthrown to the dogs. Now every other sort of death was thought more tolerable\nthan the famine, insomuch that, though the Jews despaired now of mercy,\nyet would they fly to the Romans, and would themselves, even of their own\naccord, fall among the murderous rebels also. Nor was there any place in\nthe city that had no dead bodies in it, but what was entirely covered with\nthose that were killed either by the famine or the rebellion; and all was\nfull of the dead bodies of such as had perished, either by that sedition\nor by that famine.", "So now the last hope which supported the tyrants, and that crew of\nrobbers who were with them, was in the caves and caverns under ground;\nwhither, if they could once fly, they did not expect to be searched for;\nbut endeavored, that after the whole city should be destroyed, and the\nRomans gone away, they might come out again, and escape from them. This\nwas no better than a dream of theirs; for they were not able to lie hid\neither from God or from the Romans. However, they depended on these under-ground\nsubterfuges, and set more places on fire than did the Romans themselves;\nand those that fled out of their houses thus set on fire into the ditches,\nthey killed without mercy, and pillaged them also; and if they discovered\nfood belonging to any one, they seized upon it and swallowed it down, together\nwith their blood also; nay, they were now come to fight one with another\nabout their plunder; and I cannot but think that, had not their destruction\nprevented it, their barbarity would have made them taste of even the dead\nbodies themselves.", "NOW when Caesar perceived that the upper city was so steep that it\ncould not possibly be taken without raising banks against it, he distributed\nthe several parts of that work among his army, and this on the twentieth\nday of the month Lous [Ab]. Now the carriage of the materials was a difficult\ntask, since all the trees, as I have already told you, that were about\nthe city, within the distance of a hundred furlongs, had their branches\ncut off already, in order to make the former banks. The works that belonged\nto the four legions were erected on the west side of the city, over against\nthe royal palace; but the whole body of the auxiliary troops, with the\nrest of the multitude that were with them, [erected their banks] at the\nXystus, whence they reached to the bridge, and that tower of Simon which\nhe had built as a citadel for himself against John, when they were at war\none with another.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This innumerable multitude of Jews that were \"sold\" by the Romans\nwas an eminent completion of God's ancient threatening by Moses, that if\nthey apostatized from the obedience to his laws, they should be \"sold\nunto their enemies for bond-men and bond-women,\" Deuteronomy 28;68.\nSee more especially the note on ch. 9. sect. 2.

But for the seditious, some of them, as despairing of\nsaving the city, retired from the wall to the citadel; others of them went\ndown into the subterranean vaults, though still a great many of them defended\nthemselves against those that brought the engines for the battery; yet\ndid the Romans overcome them by their number and by their strength; and,\nwhat was the principal thing of all, by going cheerfully about their work,\nwhile the Jews were quite dejected, and become weak. Now as soon as a part\nof the wall was battered down, and certain of the towers yielded to the\nimpression of the battering rams, those that opposed themselves fled away,\nand such a terror fell upon the tyrants, as was much greater than the occasion\nrequired; for before the enemy got over the breach they were quite stunned,\nand were immediately for flying away. And now one might see these men,\nwho had hitherto been so insolent and arrogant in their wicked practices,\nto be cast down and to tremble, insomuch that it would pity one's heart\nto observe the change that was made in those vile persons. Accordingly,\nthey ran with great violence upon the Roman wall that encompassed them,\nin order to force away those that guarded it, and to break through it,\nand get away. But when they saw that those who had formerly been faithful\nto them had gone away, (as indeed they were fled whithersoever the great\ndistress they were in persuaded them to flee,) as also when those that\ncame running before the rest told them that the western wall was entirely\noverthrown, while others said the Romans were gotten in, and others that\nthey were near, and looking out for them, which were only the dictates\nof their fear, which imposed upon their sight, they fell upon their face,\nand greatly lamented their own mad conduct; and their nerves were so terribly\nloosed, that they could not flee away. And here one may chiefly reflect\non the power of God exercised upon these wicked wretches, and on the good\nfortune of the Romans; for these tyrants did now wholly deprive themselves\nof the security they had in their own power, and came down from those very\ntowers of their own accord, wherein they could have never been taken by\nforce, nor indeed by any other way than by famine. And thus did the Romans,\nwhen they had taken such great pains about weaker walls, get by good fortune\nwhat they could never have gotten by their engines; for three of these\ntowers were too strong for all mechanical engines whatsoever, concerning\nwhich we have treated above.", "So they now left these towers of themselves, or rather they were\nejected out of them by God himself, and fled immediately to that valley\nwhich was under Siloam, where they again recovered themselves out of the\ndread they were in for a while, and ran violently against that part of\nthe Roman wall which lay on that side; but as their courage was too much\ndepressed to make their attacks with sufficient force, and their power\nwas now broken with fear and affliction, they were repulsed by the guards,\nand dispersing themselves at distances from each other, went down into\nthe subterranean caverns. So the Romans being now become masters of the\nwalls, they both placed their ensigns upon the towers, and made joyful\nacclamations for the victory they had gained, as having found the end of\nthis war much lighter than its beginning; for when they had gotten upon\nthe last wall, without any bloodshed, they could hardly believe what they\nfound to be true; but seeing nobody to oppose them, they stood in doubt\nwhat such an unusual solitude could mean. But when they went in numbers\ninto the lanes of the city with their swords drawn, they slew those whom\nthey overtook without and set fire to the houses whither the Jews were\nfled, and burnt every soul in them, and laid waste a great many of the\nrest; and when they were come to the houses to plunder them, they found\nin them entire families of dead men, and the upper rooms full of dead corpses,\nthat is, of such as died by the famine; they then stood in a horror at\nthis sight, and went out without touching any thing. But although they\nhad this commiseration for such as were destroyed in that manner, yet had\nthey not the same for those that were still alive, but they ran every one\nthrough whom they met with, and obstructed the very lanes with their dead\nbodies, and made the whole city run down with blood, to such a degree indeed\nthat the fire of many of the houses was quenched with these men's blood.\nAnd truly so it happened, that though the slayers left off at the evening,\nyet did the fire greatly prevail in the night; and as all was burning,\ncame that eighth day of the month Gorpieus [Elul] upon Jerusalem, a city\nthat had been liable to so many miseries during this siege, that, had it\nalways enjoyed as much happiness from its first foundation, it would certainly\nhave been the envy of the world. Nor did it on any other account so much\ndeserve these sore misfortunes, as by producing such a generation of men\nas were the occasions of this its overthrow.", "Now when Titus was come into this [upper] city, he admired not only\nsome other places of strength in it, but particularly those strong towers\nwhich the tyrants in their mad conduct had relinquished; for when he saw\ntheir solid altitude, and the largeness of their several stones, and the\nexactness of their joints, as also how great was their breadth, and how\nextensive their length, he expressed himself after the manner following:\n\"We have certainly had God for our assistant in this war, and it was\nno other than God who ejected the Jews out of these fortifications; for\nwhat could the hands of men or any machines do towards overthrowing these\ntowers?\" At which time he had many such discourses to his friends;\nhe also let such go free as had been bound by the tyrants, and were left\nin the prisons. To conclude, when he entirely demolished the rest of the\ncity, and overthrew its walls, he left these towers as a monument of his\ngood fortune, which had proved his auxiliaries, and enabled him to take\nwhat could not otherwise have been taken by him.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "See the several predictions that the Jews, if they became obstinate in\ntheir idolatry and wickedness, should be sent again or sold into Egypt\nfor their punishment, Deuteronomy 28:68; Jeremiah 44:7; Hosea 8:13; 9:3;\n9:4, 5; 2 Samuel 15:10-13; with Authentic Records, Part I. p. 49, 121;\nand Reland Painest And, tom.

That accordingly, although he did both\nadmire and tenderly regard them all, because he knew that every one of\nthem had gone as cheerfully about their work as their abilities and opportunities\nwould give them leave; yet, he said, that he would immediately bestow rewards\nand dignities on those that had fought the most bravely, and with greater\nforce, and had signalized their conduct in the most glorious manner, and\nhad made his army more famous by their noble exploits; and that no one\nwho had been willing to take more pains than another should miss of a just\nretribution for the same; for that he had been exceeding careful about\nthis matter, and that the more, because he had much rather reward the virtues\nof his fellow soldiers than punish such as had offended.", "Hereupon Titus ordered those whose business it was to read the list\nof all that had performed great exploits in this war, whom he called to\nhim by their names, and commended them before the company, and rejoiced\nin them in the same manner as a man would have rejoiced in his own exploits.\nHe also put on their heads crowns of gold, and golden ornaments about their\nnecks, and gave them long spears of gold,. and ensigns that were made of\nsilver, and removed every one of them to a higher rank; and besides this,\nhe plentifully distributed among them, out of the spoils, and the other\nprey they had taken, silver, and gold, and garments. So when they had all\nthese honors bestowed on them, according to his own appointment made to\nevery one, and he had wished all sorts of happiness to the whole army,\nhe came down, among the great acclamations which were made to him, and\nthen betook himself to offer thank-offerings [to the gods], and at once\nsacrificed a vast number of oxen, that stood ready at the altars, and distributed\nthem among the army to feast on. And when he had staid three days among\nthe principal commanders, and so long feasted with them, he sent away the\nrest of his army to the several places where they would be every one best\nsituated; but permitted the tenth legion to stay, as a guard at Jerusalem,\nand did not send them away beyond Euphrates, where they had been before.\nAnd as he remembered that the twelfth legion had given way to the Jews,\nunder Cestius their general, he expelled them out of all Syria, for they\nhad lain formerly at Raphanea, and sent them away to a place called Meletine,\nnear Euphrates, which is in the limits of Armenia and Cappadocia; he also\nthought fit that two of the legions should stay with him till he should\ngo to Egypt. He then went down with his army to that Cesarea which lay\nby the sea-side, and there laid up the rest of his spoils in great quantities,\nand gave order that the captives should he kept there; for the winter season\nhindered him then from sailing into Italy.", {"milestone": [{"@n": "2", "@unit": "Whiston section"}, {"@n": "26", "@unit": "section"}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This\nTereutius Rufus, as Reland in part observes here, is the same person whom\nthe Talmudists call Turnus Rufus; of whom they relate, that \"he ploughed\nup Sion as a field, and made Jerusalem become as heaps, and the mountain\nof the house as the high Idaces of a forest;\" which was long before\nforetold by the prophet Micah, ch. 3:12, and quoted from him in the prophecies\nof Jeremiah, ch. 26:18."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "See\nEcclesiastes 8:11."}], "#text": "NOW at the same time that Titus Caesar lay at the siege of Jerusalem,\ndid Vespasian go on board a merchantship and sailed from Alexandria to\nRhodes; whence he sailed away ,in ships with three rows of oars; and as\nhe touched at several cities that lay in his road, he was joyfully received\nby them all, and so passed over from Ionia into Greece; whence he set sail\nfrom Corcyra to the promontory of Iapyx, whence he took his journey by\nland.

When the people heard this, they could not refrain\ntheir passion, but commanded that those who were delivered up to them should\nhave fire brought to burn them, who were accordingly all burnt upon the\ntheater immediately. They did also fall violently upon the multitude of\nthe Jews, as supposing that by punishing them suddenly they should save\ntheir own city. As for Antiochus, he aggravated the rage they were in,\nand thought to give them a demonstration of his own conversion, arm of\nhis hatred of the Jewish customs, by sacrificing after the manner of the\nGreeks; he persuaded the rest also to compel them to do the same, because\nthey would by that means discover who they were that had plotted against\nthem, since they would not do so; and when the people of Antioch tried\nthe experiment, some few complied, but those that would not do so were\nslain. As for Ailtiochus himself, he obtained soldiers from the Roman commander,\nand became a severe master over his own citizens, not permitting them to\nrest on the seventh day, but forcing them to do all that they usually did\non other days; and to that degree of distress did he reduce them in this\nmatter, that the rest of the seventh day was dissolved not only at Antioch,\nbut the same thing which took thence its rise was done in other cities\nalso, in like manner, for some small time."}, "Now, after these misfortunes had happened to the Jews at Antioch,\na second calamity befell them, the description of which when we were going\nabout we premised the account foregoing; for upon this accident, whereby\nthe four-square market-place was burnt down, as well as the archives, and\nthe place where the public records were preserved, and the royal palaces,\n(and it was not without difficulty that the fire was then put a stop to,\nwhich was likely, by the fury wherewith it was carried along, to have gone\nover the whole city,) Antiochus accused the Jews as the occasion of all\nthe mischief that was done. Now this induced the people of Antioch, who\nwere now under the immediate persuasion, by reason of the disorder they\nwere in, that this calumny was true, and would have been under the same\npersuasion, even though they had not borne an ill-will at the Jews before,\nto believe this man's accusation, especially when they considered what\nhad been done before, and this to such a degree, that they all fell violently\nupon those that were accused, and this, like madmen, in a very furious\nrage also, even as if they had seen the Jews in a manner setting fire themselves\nto the city; nor was it without difficulty that one Cneius Collegas, the\nlegate, could prevail with them to permit the affairs to be laid before\nCaesar; for as to Cesennius Petus, the president of Syria, Vespasian had\nalready sent him away; and so it happened that he was not yet come back\nthither. But when Collegas had made a careful inquiry into the matter,\nhe found out the truth, and that not one of those Jews that were accused\nby Antiochus had any hand in it, but that all was done by some vile persons\ngreatly in debt, who supposed that if they could once set fire to the market-place,\nand burn the public records, they should have no further demands made upon\nthem. So the Jews were under great disorder and terror, in the uncertain\nexpectations of what would be the upshot of these accusations against them.", "AND now Titus Caesar, upon the news that was brought him concerning\nhis father, that his coming was much desired by all the Italian cities, and that Rome\nespecially received him with great alacrity and splendor, betook himself\nto rejoicing and pleasures to a great degree, as now freed from the solicitude\nhe had been under, after the most agreeable manner. For all men that were\nin Italy showed their respects to him in their minds before he came thither,\nas if he were already come, as esteeming the very expectation they had\nof him to be his real presence, on account of the great desires they had\nto see him, and because the good-will they bore him was entirely free and\nunconstrained; for it was, desirable thing to the senate, who well remembered\nthe calamities they had undergone in the late changes of their governors,\nto receive a governor who was adorned with the gravity of old age, and\nwith the highest skill in the actions of war, whose advancement would be,\nas they knew, for nothing else but for the preservation of those that were\nto be governed. Moreover, the people had been so harassed by their civil\nmiseries, that they were still more earnest for his coming immediately,\nas supposing they should then be firmly delivered from their calamities,\nand believed they should then recover their secure tranquillity and prosperity;\nand for the soldiery, they had the principal regard to him, for they were\nchiefly apprized of his great exploits in war; and since they had experienced\nthe want of skill and want of courage in other commanders, they were very\ndesirous to be free from that great shame they had undergone by their means,\nand heartily wished to receive such a prince as might be a security and\nan ornament to them. And as this good-will to Vespasian was universal,\nthose that enjoyed any remarkable dignities could not have patience enough\nto stay in Rome, but made haste to meet him at a very great distance from\nit; nay, indeed, none of the rest could endure the delay of seeing him,\nbut did all pour out of the city in such crowds, and were so universally\npossessed with the opinion that it was easier and better for them to go\nout than to stay there, that this was the very first time that the city\njoyfully perceived itself almost empty of its citizens; for those that\nstaid within were fewer than those that went out. But as soon as the news\nwas come that he was hard by, and those that had met him at first related\nwith what good humor he received every one that came to him, then it was\nthat the whole multitude that had remained in the city, with their wives\nand children, came into the road, and waited for him there; and for those\nwhom he passed by, they made all sorts of acclamations, on account of the\njoy they had to see him, and the pleasantness of his countenance, and styled\nhim their Benefactor and Savior, and the only person who was worthy to\nbe ruler of the city of Rome. And now the city was like a temple, full\nof garlands and sweet odors; nor was it easy for him to come to the royal\npalace, for the multitude of the people that stood about him, where yet\nat last he performed his sacrifices of thanksgiving to his household gods\nfor his safe return to the city. The multitude did also betake themselves\nto feasting; which feasts and drink-offerings they celebrated by their\ntribes, and their families, and their neighborhoods, and still prayed God\nto grant that Vespasian, his sons, and all their posterity, might continue\nin the Roman government for a very long time, and that his dominion might\nbe preserved from all opposition.

Besides these motives, it was the opportunity that\nnow offered itself, which above all the rest prevailed with them so to\ndo; for when they saw the Roman government in a great internal disorder,\nby the continual changes of its rulers, and understood that every part\nof the habitable earth under them was in an unsettled and tottering condition,\nthey thought this was the best opportunity that couldd afford itself for\nthemselves to make a sedition, when the state of the Romans was so ill.\nClassicus \nalso, and Vitellius, two of their commanders, puffed them up with such\nhopes. These had for a long time been openly desirous of such an innovation,\nand were induced by the present opportunity to venture upon the declaration\nof their sentiments; the multitude was also ready; and when these men told\nthem of what they intended to attempt, that news was gladly received by\nthem. So when a great part of the Germans had agreed to rebel, and the\nrest were no better disposed, Vespasian, as guided by Divine Providence,\nsent letters to Petilius Cerealis, who had formerly had the command of\nGermany, whereby he declared him to have the dignity of consul, and commanded\nhim to take upon him the government of Britain; so he went whither he was\nordered to go, and when he was informed of the revolt of the Germans, he\nfell upon them as soon as they were gotten together, and put his army in\nbattle-array, and slew a great number of them in the fight, and forced\nthem to leave off their madness, and to grow wiser; nay, had he not fallen\nthus suddenly upon them on the place, it had not been long ere they would\nhowever have been brought to punishment; for as soon as ever the news of\ntheir revolt was come to Rome, and Caesar Domitian was made acquainted\nwith it, he made no delay, even at that his age, when he was exceeding\nyoung, but undertook this weighty affair. He had a courageous mind from\nhis father, and had made greater improvements than belonged to such an\nage: accordingly he marched against the barbarians immediately; whereupon\ntheir hearts failed them at the very rumor of his approach, and they submitted\nthemselves to him with fear, and thought it a happy thing that they were\nbrought under their old yoke again without suffering any further mischiefs.\nWhen therefore Domitian had settled all the affairs of Gaul in such good\norder, that it would not be easily put into disorder any more, he returned\nto Rome with honor and glory, as having performed such exploits as were\nabove his own age, but worthy of so great a father."}, "At the very same time with the forementioned revolt of the Germans\ndid the bold attempt of the Scythians against the Romans occur; for those\nScythians who are called Sarmatians, being a very numerous people, transported\nthemselves over the Danube into Mysia, without being perceived; after which,\nby their violence, and entirely unexpected assault, they slew a great many\nof the Romans that guarded the frontiers; and as the consular legate Fonteius\nAgrippa came to meet them, and fought courageously against them, he was\nslain by them. They then overran all the region that had been subject to\nhim, tearing and rending every thing that fell in their way. But when Vespasian\nwas informed of what had happened, and how Mysia was laid waste, he sent\naway Rubrius Gallus to punish these Sarmatians; by whose means many of\nthem perished in the battles he fought against them, and that part which\nescaped fled with fear to their own country. So when this general had put\nan end to the war, he provided for the future security of the country also;\nfor he placed more and more numerous garrisons in the place, till he made\nit altogether impossible for the barbarians to pass over the river any\nmore.

However, Titus would not grant that neither,\nbut permitted the Jews of Antioch to continue to enjoy the very same privileges\nin that city which they had before, and then departed for Egypt; and as\nhe came to Jerusalem in his progress, and compared the melancholy condition\nhe saw it then in, with the ancient glory of the city, and called to mind\nthe greatness of its present ruins, as well as its ancient splendor, he\ncould not but pity the destruction of the city, so far was he from boasting\nthat so great and goodly a city as that was had been by him taken by force;\nnay, he frequently cursed those that had been the authors of their revolt,\nand had brought such a punishment upon the city; insomuch that it openly\nappeared that he did not desire that such a calamity as this punishment\nof theirs amounted to should be a demonstration of his courage. Yet was\nthere no small quantity of the riches that had been in that city still\nfound among its ruins, a great deal of which the Romans dug up; but the\ngreatest part was discovered by those who were captives, and so they carried\nit away; I mean the gold and the silver, and the rest of that most precious\nfurniture which the Jews had, and which the owners had treasured up under\nground, against the uncertain fortunes of war.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Vespasian\nand his two sons, Titus and Domitian."}, "#text": "So Titus took the journey he intended into Egypt, and passed over\nthe desert very suddenly, and came to Alexandria, and took up a resolution\nto go to Rome by sea.

Whereupon the soldiery made an acclamation\nof joy to them immediately, and all gave them attestations of their valor;\nwhile they were themselves without their arms, and only in their silken\ngarments, and crowned with laurel: then Vespasian accepted of these shouts\nof theirs; but while they were still disposed to go on in such acclamations,\nhe gave them a signal of silence. And when every body entirely held their\npeace, he stood up, and covering the greatest part of his head with his\ncloak, he put up the accustomed solemn prayers; the like prayers did Titus\nput up also; after which prayers Vespasian made a short speech to all the\npeople, and then sent away the soldiers to a dinner prepared for them by\nthe emperors. Then did he retire to that gate which was called the Gate\nof the Pomp, because pompous shows do always go through that gate; there\nit was that they tasted some food, and when they had put on their triumphal\ngarments, and had offered sacrifices to the gods that were placed at the\ngate, they sent the triumph forward, and marched through the theatres,\nthat they might be the more easily seen by the multitudes.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "See\nthe representations of these Jewish vessels as they still stand on Titus's\ntriumphal arch at Rome, in Reland's very curious book de Spoliis Ternpli,\nthroughout.

There were also precious stones that were\ntransparent, some set in crowns of gold, and some in other ouches, as the\nworkmen pleased; and of these such a vast number were brought, that we\ncould not but thence learn how vainly we imagined any of them to be rarities.\nThe images of the gods were also carried, being as well wonderful for their\nlargeness, as made very artificially, and with great skill of the workmen;\nnor were any of these images of any other than very costly materials; and\nmany species of animals were brought, every one in their own natural ornaments.\nThe men also who brought every one of these shows were great multitudes,\nand adorned with purple garments, all over interwoven with gold; those\nthat were chosen for carrying these pompous shows having also about them\nsuch magnificent ornaments as were both extraordinary and surprising. Besides\nthese, one might see that even the great number of the captives was not\nunadorned, while the variety that was in their garments, and their fine\ntexture, concealed from the sight the deformity of their bodies. But what\nafforded the greatest surprise of all was the structure of the pageants\nthat were borne along; for indeed he that met them could not but be afraid\nthat the bearers would not be able firmly enough to support them, such\nwas their magnitude; for many of them were so made, that they were on three\nor even four stories, one above another. The magnificence also of their\nstructure afforded one both pleasure and surprise; for upon many of them\nwere laid carpets of gold. There was also wrought gold and ivory fastened\nabout them all; and many resemblances of the war, and those in several\nways, and variety of contrivances, affording a most lively portraiture\nof itself. For there was to be seen a happy country laid waste, and entire\nsquadrons of enemies slain; while some of them ran away, and some were\ncarried into captivity; with walls of great altitude and magnitude overthrown\nand ruined by machines; with the strongest fortifications taken, and the\nwalls of most populous cities upon the tops of hills seized on, and an\narmy pouring itself within the walls; as also every place full of slaughter,\nand supplications of the enemies, when they were no longer able to lift\nup their hands in way of opposition. Fire also sent upon temples was here\nrepresented, and houses overthrown, and falling upon their owners: rivers\nalso, after they came out of a large and melancholy desert, ran down, not\ninto a land cultivated, nor as drink for men, or for cattle, but through\na land still on fire upon every side; for the Jews related that such a\nthing they had undergone during this war. Now the workmanship of these\nrepresentations was so magnificent and lively in the construction of the\nthings, that it exhibited what had been done to such as did not see it,\nas if they had been there really present. On the top of every one of these\npageants was placed the commander of the city that was taken, and the manner\nwherein he was taken. Moreover, there followed those pageants a great number\nof ships; and for the other spoils, they were carried in great plenty.\nBut for those that were taken in the temple of Jerusalem, \nthey made the greatest figure of them all; that is, the golden table, of\nthe weight of many talents; the candlestick also, that was made of gold,\nthough its construction were now changed from that which we made use of;\nfor its middle shaft was fixed upon a basis, and the small branches were\nproduced out of it to a great length, having the likeness of a trident\nin their position, and had every one a socket made of brass for a lamp\nat the tops of them. These lamps were in number seven, and represented\nthe dignity of the number seven among the Jews; and the last of all the\nspoils, was carried the Law of the Jews. After these spoils passed by a\ngreat many men, carrying the images of Victory, whose structure was entirely\neither of ivory or of gold. After which Vespasian marched in the first\nplace, and Titus followed him; Domitian also rode along with them, and\nmade a glorious appearance, and rode on a horse that was worthy of admiration."}, "Now the last part of this pompous show was at the temple of Jupiter\nCapitolinus, whither when they were come, they stood still; for it was\nthe Romans' ancient custom to stay till somebody brought the news that\nthe general of the enemy was slain. This general was Simon, the son of\nGioras, who had then been led in this triumph among the captives; a rope\nhad also been put upon his head, and he had been drawn into a proper place\nin the forum, and had withal been tormented by those that drew him along;\nand the law of the Romans required that malefactors condemned to die should\nbe slain there. Accordingly, when it was related that there was an end\nof him, and all the people had set up a shout for joy, they then began\nto offer those sacrifices which they had consecrated, in the prayers used\nin such solemnities; which when they had finished, they went away to the\npalace. And as for some of the spectators, the emperors entertained them\nat their own feast; and for all the rest there were noble preparations\nmade for feasting at home; for this was a festival day to the city of Rome,\nas celebrated for the victory obtained by their army over their enemies,\nfor the end that was now put to their civil miseries, and for the commencement\nof their hopes of future prosperity and happiness.", "After these triumphs were over, and after the affairs of the Romans\nwere settled on the surest foundations, Vespasian resolved to build a temple\nto Peace, which was finished in so short a time, and in so glorious a manner,\nas was beyond all human expectation and opinion: for he having now by Providence\na vast quantity of wealth, besides what he had formerly gained in his other\nexploits, he had this temple adorned with pictures and statues; for in\nthis temple were collected and deposited all such rarities as men aforetime\nused to wander all over the habitable world to see, when they had a desire\nto see one of them after another; he also laid up therein those golden\nvessels and instruments that were taken out of the Jewish temple, as ensigns\nof his glory. But still he gave order that they should lay up their Law,\nand the purple veils of the holy place, in the royal palace itself, and\nkeep them there.", "NOW Lucilius Bassus was sent as legate into Judea, and there he received\nthe army from Cerealis Vitellianus, and took that citadel which was in\nHerodium, together with the garrison that was in it; after which he got\ntogether all the soldiery that was there, (which was a large body, but\ndispersed into several parties,) with the tenth legion, and resolved to\nmake war upon Macherus; for it was highly necessary that this citadel should\nbe demolished, lest it might be a means of drawing away many into a rebellion,\nby reason of its strength; for the nature of the place was very capable\nof affording the surest hopes of safety to those that possessed it, as\nwell as delay and fear to those that should attack it; for what was walled\nin was itself a very rocky hill, elevated to a very great height; which\ncircumstance alone made it very hard to he subdued. It was also so contrived\nby nature, that it could not be easily ascended; for it is, as it were,\nditched about with such valleys on all sides, and to such a depth, that\nthe eye cannot reach their bottoms, and such as are not easily to be passed\nover, and even such as it is impossible to fill up with earth. For that\nvalley which cuts it on the west extends to threescore furlongs, and did\nnot end till it came to the lake Asphaltitis; on the same side it was also\nthat Macherus had the tallest top of its hill elevated above the rest.\nBut then for the valleys that lay on the north and south sides, although\nthey be not so large as that already described, yet it is in like manner\nan impracticable thing to think of getting over them; and for the valley\nthat lies on the east side, its depth is found to be no less than a hundred\ncubits. It extends as far as a mountain that lies over against Macherus,\nwith which it is bounded.", "Now when Alexander [Janneus], the king of the Jews, observed the\nnature of this place, he was the first who built a citadel here, which\nafterwards was demolished by Gabinius, when he made war against Aristobulus.\nBut when Herod came to be king, he thought the place to be worthy of the\nutmost regard, and of being built upon in the firmest manner, and this\nespecially because it lay so near to Arabia; for it is seated in a convenient\nplace on that account, and hath a prospect toward that country; he therefore\nsurrounded a large space of ground with walls and towers, and built a city\nthere, out of which city there was a way that led up to the very citadel\nitself on the top of the mountain; nay, more than this, he built a wall\nround that top of the hill, and erected towers at the corners, of a hundred\nand sixty cubits high; in the middle of which place he built a palace,\nafter a magnificent manner, wherein were large and beautiful edifices.\nHe also made a great many reservoirs for the reception of water, that there\nmight be plenty of it ready for all uses, and those in the properest places\nthat were afforded him there. Thus did he, as it were, contend with the\nnature of the place, that he might exceed its natural strength and security\n(which yet itself rendered it hard to be taken) by those fortifications\nwhich were made by the hands of men. Moreover, he put a large quantity\nof darts and other machines of war into it, and contrived to get every\nthing thither that might any way contribute to its inhabitants' security,\nunder the longest siege possible.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Spanheim observes here, that in Graceia Major and Sicily they had rue prodigiously\ngreat and durable, like this rue at Macherus,"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This strange account of the place and root Baaras seems to have been taken\nfrom the magicians, and the root to have been made use of in the days of\nJosephus, in that superstitious way of casting out demons, supposed by\nhim to have been derived from king Solomon; of which we have already seen\nhe had a great opinion, Antiq. B. VIII. ch. 2. sect. 5. We also may hence\nlearn the true notion Josephus had of demons and demoniacs, exactly like\nthat of the Jews and Christians in the New Testament, and the first four\ncenturies. See Antiq. B.

XI, ch. 2. sect. 3."}], "#text": "Now within this place there grew a sort of rue \nthat deserves our wonder on account of its largeness, for it was no way\ninferior to any fig tree whatsoever, either in height or in thickness;\nand the report is, that it had lasted ever since the times of Herod, and\nwould probably have lasted much longer, had it not been cut down by those\nJews who took possession of the place afterward. But still in that valley\nwhich encompasses the city on the north side there is a certain place called\nBaaras, which produces a root of the same name with itself \nits color is like to that of flame, and towards the evenings it sends out\na certain ray like lightning. It is not easily taken by such as would do\nit, but recedes from their hands, nor will yield itself to be taken quietly,\nuntil either the urine of a woman, or her menstrual blood, be poured upon\nit; nay, even then it is certain death to those that touch it, unless any\none take and hang the root itself down from his hand, and so carry it away.\nIt may also be taken another way, without danger, which is this: they dig\na trench quite round about it, till the hidden part of the root be very\nsmall, they then tie a dog to it, and when the dog tries hard to follow\nhim that tied him, this root is easily plucked up, but the dog dies immediately,\nas if it were instead of the man that would take the plant away; nor after\nthis need any one be afraid of taking it into their hands. Yet, after all\nthis pains in getting, it is only valuable on account of one virtue it\nhath, that if it be only brought to sick persons, it quickly drives away\nthose called demons, which are no other than the spirits of the wicked,\nthat enter into men that are alive and kill them, unless they can obtain\nsome help against them. Here are also fountains of hot water, that flow\nout of this place, which have a very different taste one from the other;\nfor some of them are bitter, and others of them are plainly sweet. Here\nare also many eruptions of cold waters, and this not only in the places\nthat lie lower, and have their fountains near one another, but, what is\nstill more wonderful, here is to be seen a certain cave hard by, whose\ncavity is not deep, but it is covered over by a rock that is prominent;\nabove this rock there stand up two [hills or] breasts, as it were, but\na little distant one from another, the one of which sends out a fountain\nthat is very cold, and the other sends out one that is very hot; which\nwaters, when they are mingled together, compose a most pleasant bath; they\nare medicinal indeed for other maladies, but especially good for strengthening\nthe nerves. This place has in it also mines of sulfur and alum."}, "Now when Bassus had taken a full view of this place, he resolved\nto besiege it, by filling up the valley that lay on the east side; so he\nfell hard to work, and took great pains to raise his banks as soon as possible,\nand by that means to render the siege easy. As for the Jews that were caught\nin this place, they separated themselves from the strangers that were with\nthem, and they forced those strangers, as an otherwise useless multitude,\nto stay in the lower part of the city, and undergo the principal dangers,\nwhile they themselves seized on the upper citadel, and held it, and this\nboth on account of its strength, and to provide for their own safety. They\nalso supposed they might obtain their pardon, in case they should [at last]\nsurrender the citadel. However, they were willing to make trial, in the\nfirst place, whether the hopes they had of avoiding a siege would come\nto any thing; with which intention they made sallies every day, and fought\nwith those that met them; in which conflicts they were many of them slain,\nas they therein slew many of the Romans. But still it was the opportunities\nthat presented themselves which chiefly gained both sides their victories;\nthese were gained by the Jews, when they fell upon the Romans as they were\noff their guard; but by the Romans, when, upon the others' sallies against\ntheir banks, they foresaw their coming, and were upon their lard when they\nreceived them. But the conclusion of this siege did not depend upon these\nbickerings; but a certain surprising accident, relating to what was done\nin this siege, forced the Jews to surrender the citadel. There was a certain\nyoung man among the besieged, of great boldness, and very active of his\nhand, his name was Eleazar; he greatly signalized himself in those sallies,\nand encouraged the Jews to go out in great numbers, in order to hinder\nthe raising of the banks, and did the Romans a vast deal of mischief when\nthey came to fighting; he so managed matters, that those who sallied out\nmade their attacks easily, and returned back without danger, and this by\nstill bringing up the rear himself. Now it happened that, on a certain\ntime, when the fight was over, and both sides were parted, and retired\nhome, he, in way of contempt of the enemy, and thinking that none of them\nwould begin the fight again at that time, staid without the gates, and\ntalked with those that were upon the wall, and his mind was wholly intent\nupon what they said. Now a certain person belonging to the Roman camp,\nwhose lame was Rufus, by birth an Egyptian, ran upon him suddenly, when\nnobody expected such a thing, and carried him off, with his armor itself;\nwhile, in the mean time, those that saw it from the wall were under such\nan amazement, that Rufus prevented their assistance, and carried Eleazar\nto the Roman camp. So the general of the Romans ordered that he should\nbe taken up naked, set before the city to be seen, and sorely whipped before\ntheir eyes. Upon this sad accident that befell the young man, the Jews\nwere terribly confounded, and the city, with one voice, sorely lamented\nhim, and the mourning proved greater than could well be supposed upon the\ncalamity of a single person. When Bassus perceived that, he began to think\nof using a stratagem against the enemy, and was desirous to aggravate their\ngrief, in order to prevail with them to surrender the city for the preservation\nof that man. Nor did he fail of his hope; for he commanded them to set\nup a cross, as if he were just going to hang Eleazar upon it immediately;\nthe sight of this occasioned a sore grief among those that were in the\ncitadel, and they groaned vehemently, and cried out that they could not\nbear to see him thus destroyed. Whereupon Eleazar besought them not to\ndisregard him, now he was going to suffer a most miserable death, and exhorted\nthem to save themselves, by yielding to the Roman power and good fortune,\nsince all other people were now conquered by them. These men were greatly\nmoved with what he said, there being also many within the city that interceded\nfor him, because he was of an eminent and very numerous family; so they\nnow yielded to their passion of commiseration, contrary to their usual\ncustom. Accordingly, they sent out immediately certain messengers, and\ntreated with the Romans, in order to a surrender of the citadel to them,\nand desired that they might be permitted to go away, and take Eleazar along\nwith them. Then did the Romans and their general accept of these terms;\nwhile the multitude of strangers that were in the lower part of the city,\nhearing of the agreement that was made by the Jews for themselves alone,\nwere resolved to fly away privately in the night time; but as soon as they\nhad opened their gates, those that had come to terms with Bassus told him\nof it; whether it were that they envied the others' deliverance, or whether\nit were done out of fear, lest an occasion should be taken against them\nupon their escape, is uncertain. The most courageous, therefore, of those\nmen that went out prevented the enemy, and got away, and fled for it; but\nfor those men that were caught within they", "When Bassus had settled these affairs, he marched hastily to the\nforest of Jarden, as it is called; for he had heard that a great many of\nthose that had fled from Jerusalem and Macherus formerly were there gotten\ntogether. When he was therefore come to the place, and understood that\nthe former news was no mistake, he, in the first place, surrounded the\nwhole place with his horsemen, that such of the Jews as had boldness enough\nto try to break through might have no way possible for escaping, by reason\nof the situation of these horsemen; and for the footmen, he ordered them\nto cut down the trees that were in the wood whither they were fled. So\nthe Jews were under a necessity of performing some glorious exploit, and\nof greatly exposing themselves in a battle, since they might perhaps thereby\nescape. So they made a general attack, and with a great shout fell upon\nthose that surrounded them, who received them with great courage; and so\nwhile the one side fought desperately, and the others would not yield,\nthe fight was prolonged on that account. But the event of the battle did\nnot answer the expectation of the assailants; for so it happened, that\nno more than twelve fell on the Roman side, with a few that were wounded;\nbut not one of the Jews escaped out of this battle, but they were all killed,\nbeing in the whole not fewer in number than three thousand, together with\nJudas, the son of Jairus, their general, concerning whom we have before\nspoken, that he had been a captain of a certain band at the siege of Jerusalem,\nand by going down into a certain vault under ground, had privately made\nhis escape.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "It is very remarkable that Titus did not people this now desolate country\nof Judea, but ordered it to be all sold; nor indeed is it properly peopled\nat this day, but lies ready for its old inhabitants the Jews, at their\nfuture restoration.

II. p. 429, and under the name Ammaus also. But he justly\nthinks that that in St. Luke may well be the same with his Ammaus before\nus, especially since the Greek copies here usually make it sixty furlongs\ndistant from Jerusalem, as does St. Luke, though the Latin copies say only\nthirty.

He also laid a tribute upon\nthe Jews wheresoever they were, and enjoined every one of them to bring\ntwo drachmae every year into the Capitol, as they used to pay the same\nto the temple at Jerusalem. And this was the state of the Jewish affairs\nat this time."}, "AND now, in the fourth year of the reign of Vespasian, it came to\npass that Antiochus, the king of Commagene, with all his family, fell into\nvery great calamities. The occasion was this: Cesennius Petus, who was\npresident of Syria at this time, whether it were done out of regard to\ntruth, or whether out of hatred to Antiochus, (for which was the real motive\nwas never thoroughly discovered,) sent an epistle to Caesar, and therein\ntold him that Antiochus, with his son Epiphanes, had resolved to rebel\nagainst the Romans, and had made a league with the king of Parthia to that\npurpose; that it was therefore fit to prevent them, lest they prevent us,\nand begin such a war as may cause a general disturbance in the Roman empire.\nNow Caesar was disposed to take some care about the matter, since this\ndiscovery was made; for the neighborhood of the kingdoms made this affair\nworthy of greater regard; for Samoseta, the capital of Commagene, lies\nupon Euphrates, and upon any such design could afford an easy passage over\nit to the Parthians, and could also afford them a secure reception. Petus\nwas accordingly believed, and had authority given him of doing what he\nshould think proper in the case; so he set about it without delay, and\nfell upon Commagene before Antiochus and his people had the least expectation\nof his coming: he had with him the tenth legion, as also some cohorts and\ntroops of horsemen. These kings also came to his assistance: Aristobulus,\nking of the country called Chalcidene, and Sohemus, who was called king\nof Emesa. Nor was there any opposition made to his forces when they entered\nthe kingdom; for no one of that country would so much as lift up his hand\nagainst them. When Antiochus heard this unexpected news, he could not think\nin the least of making war with the Romans, but determined to leave his\nwhole kingdom in the state wherein it now was, and to retire privately,\nwith his wife and children, as thinking thereby to demonstrate himself\nto the Romans to be innocent as to the accusation laid against him. So\nhe went away from that city as far as a hundred and twenty furlongs, into\na plain, and there pitched his tents.", "Petus then sent some of his men to seize upon Samosate, and by their\nmeans took possession of that city, while he went himself to attack Antiochus\nwith the rest of his army. However, the king was not prevailed upon by\nthe distress he was in to do any thing in the way of war against the Romans,\nbut bemoaned his own hard fate, and endured with patience what he was not\nable to prevent. But his sons, who were young, and unexperienced in war,\nbut of strong bodies, were not easily induced to bear this calamity without\nfighting. Epiphanes, therefore, and Callinicus, betook themselves to military\nforce; and as the battle was a sore one, and lasted all the day long, they\nshowed their own valor in a remarkable manner, and nothing but the approach\nof night put a period thereto, and that without any diminution of their\nforces; yet would not Antiochus, upon this conclusion of the fight, continue\nthere by any means, but took his wife and his daughters, and fled away\nwith them to Cilicia, and by so doing quite discouraged the minds of his\nown soldiers. Accordingly, they revolted, and went over to the Romans,\nout of the despair they were in of his keeping the kingdom; and his case\nwas looked upon by all as quite desperate. It was therefore necessary that\nEpiphanes and his soldiers should get clear of their enemies before they\nbecame entirely destitute of any confederates; nor were there any more\nthan ten horsemen with him, who passed with him over Euphrates, whence\nthey went undisturbed to Vologeses, the king of Parthie, where they were\nnot disregarded as fugitives, but had the same respect paid them as if\nthey had retained their ancient prosperity.", "Now when Antiochus was come to Tarsus in Cilicia, Petus ordered a\ncenturion to go to him, and send him in bonds to Rome. However, Vespasian\ncould not endure to have a king brought to him in that manner, but thought\nit fit rather to have a regard to the ancient friendship that had been\nbetween them, than to preserve an inexorable anger upon pretense of this\nwar. Accordingly, he gave orders that they should take off his bonds, while\nhe was still upon the road, and that he should not come to Rome, but should\nnow go and live at Lacedemon; he also gave him large revenues, that he\nmight not only live in plenty, but like a king also. When Epiphanes, who\nbefore was in great fear for his father, was informed of this, their minds\nwere freed from that great and almost incurable concern they had been under.\nHe also hoped that Caesar would be reconciled to them, upon the intercession\nof Vologeses; for although he lived in plenty, he knew not how to bear\nliving out of the Roman empire. So Caesar gave him leave, after an obliging\nmanner, and he came to Rome; and as his father came quickly to him from\nLacedemon, he had all sorts of respect paid him there, and there he remained.", "Now there was a nation of the Alans, which we have formerly mentioned\nsome where as being Scythians and inhabiting at the lake Meotis. This nation\nabout this time laid a design of falling upon Media, and the parts beyond\nit, in order to plunder them; with which intention they treated with the\nking of Hyrcania; for he was master of that passage which king Alexander\n[the Great] shut up with iron gates. This king gave them leave to come\nthrough them; so they came in great multitudes, and fell upon the Medes\nunexpectedly, and plundered their country, which they found full of people,\nand replenished with abundance of cattle, while nobody durst make any resistance\nagainst them; for Paeorus, the king of the country, had fled away for fear\ninto places where they could not easily come at him, and had yielded up\nevery thing he had to them, and had only saved his wife and his concubines\nfrom them, and that with difficulty also, after they had been made captives,\nby giving them a hundred talents for their ransom. These Alans therefore\nplundered the country without opposition, and with great ease, and proceeded\nas far as Armenia, laying all waste before them. Now Tiridates was king\nof that country, who met them, and fought them, but had like to have been\ntaken alive in the battle; for a certain man threw a net over him from\na great distance, and had soon drawn him to him, unless he had immediately\ncut the cord with his sword, and ran away, and prevented it. So the Alans,\nbeing still more provoked by this sight, laid waste the country, and drove\na great multitude of the men, and a great quantity of the other prey they\nhad gotten out of both kingdoms, along with them, and then retreated back\nto their own country.", "WHEN Bassus was dead in Judea, Flavius Silva succeeded him as procurator\nthere; who, when he saw that all the rest of the country was subdued in\nthis war, and that there was but one only strong hold that was still in\nrebellion, he got all his army together that lay in different places, and\nmade an expedition against it. This fortress was called Masada. It was\none Eleazar, a potent man, and the commander of these Sicarii, that had\nseized upon it. He was a descendant from that Judas who had persuaded abundance\nof the Jews, as we have formerly related, not to submit to the taxation\nwhen Cyrenius was sent into Judea to make one; for then it was that the\nSicarii got together against those that were willing to submit to the Romans,\nand treated them in all respects as if they had been their enemies, both\nby plundering them of what they had, by driving away their cattle, and\nby setting fire to their houses; for they said that they differed not at\nall from foreigners, by betraying, in so cowardly a manner, that freedom\nwhich Jews thought worthy to be contended for to the utmost, and by owning\nthat they preferred slavery under the Romans before such a contention.\nNow this was in reality no better than a pretense and a cloak for the barbarity\nwhich was made use of by them, and to color over their own avarice, which\nthey afterwards made evident by their own actions; for those that were\npartners with them in their rebellion joined also with them in the war\nagainst the Romans, and went further lengths with them in their impudent\nundertakings against them; and when they were again convicted of dissembling\nin such their pretenses, they still more abused those that justly reproached\nthem for their wickedness. And indeed that was a time most fertile in all\nmanner of wicked practices, insomuch that no kind of evil deeds were then\nleft undone; nor could any one so much as devise any bad thing that was\nnew, so deeply were they all infected, and strove with one another in their\nsingle capacity, and in their communities, who should run the greatest\nlengths in impiety towards God, and in unjust actions towards their neighbors;\nthe men of power oppressing the multitude, and the multitude earnestly\nlaboring to destroy the men of power. The one part were desirous of tyrannizing\nover others, and the rest of offering violence to others, and of plundering\nsuch as were richer than themselves. They were the Sicarii who first began\nthese transgressions, and first became barbarous towards those allied to\nthem, and left no words of reproach unsaid, and no works of perdition untried,\nin order to destroy those whom their contrivances affected. Yet did John\ndemonstrate by his actions that these Sicarii were more moderate than he\nwas himself, for he not only slew all such as gave him good counsel to\ndo what was right, but treated them worst of all, as the most bitter enemies\nthat he had among all the Citizens; nay, he filled his entire country with\nten thousand instances of wickedness, such as a man who was already hardened\nsufficiently in his impiety towards God would naturally do; for the food\nwas unlawful that was set upon his table, and he rejected those purifications\nthat the law of his country had ordained; so that it was no longer a wonder\nif he, who was so mad in his impiety towards God, did not observe any rules\nof gentleness and common affection towards men. Again, therefore, what\nmischief was there which Simon the son of Gioras did not do? or what kind\nof abuses did he abstain from as to those very free-men who had set him\nup for a tyrant? What friendship or kindred were there that did not make\nhim more bold in his daily murders? for they looked upon the doing of mischief\nto strangers only as a work beneath their courage, but thought their barbarity\ntowards their nearest relations would be a glorious demonstration thereof.\nThe Idumeans also strove with these men who should be guilty of the greatest\nmadness! for they [all], vile wretches as they were, cut the throats of\nthe high priests, that so no part of a religious regard to God. might be\npreserved; they thence proceeded to destroy utterly the least remains of\na political government, and introduced the most complete scene of iniquity\nin all instances that were practicable; under which scene that sort of\npeople that were called zealots grew up, and who indeed corresponded to\nthe name; for they imitated every wicked work; nor, if their memory suggested\nany evil thing that had formerly been done, did they avoid zealously to\npursue the same; and although they gave themselves that name from their\nzeal for what was good, yet did it agree to them only by way of irony,\non account of those they had unjustly treated by their wild and brutish\ndisposition, or as thinking the greatest mischiefs to be the greatest good.\nAccordingly, they all met with such ends as God deservedly brought upon\nthem in way of punishment; for all such miseries have been sent upon them\nas man's nature is capable of undergoing, till the utmost period of their\nlives, and till death came upon them in various ways of torment; yet might\none say justly that they suffered less than they had done, because it was\nimpossible they could be punished according to their deserving. But to\nmake a lamentation according to the deserts of those who fell under these\nmen's barbarity, this is not a proper place for it; - I therefore now return\nagain to the remaining part of the present narration.", "For now it was that the Roman general came, and led his army against\nEleazar and those Sicarii who held the fortress Masada together with him;\nand for the whole country adjoining, he presently gained it, and put garrisons\ninto the most proper places of it; he also built a wall quite round the\nentire fortress, that none of the besieged might easily escape; he also\nset his men to guard the several parts of it; he also pitched his camp\nin such an agreeable place as he had chosen for the siege, and at which\nplace the rock belonging to the fortress did make the nearest approach\nto the neighboring mountain, which yet was a place of difficulty for getting\nplenty of provisions; for it was not only food that was to be brought from\na great distance [to the army], and this with a great deal of pain to those\nJews who were appointed for that purpose, but water was also to be brought\nto the camp, because the place afforded no fountain that was near it. When\ntherefore Silva had ordered these affairs beforehand, he fell to besieging\nthe place; which siege was likely to stand in need of a great deal of skill\nand pains, by reason of the strength of the fortress, the nature of which\nI will now describe.", {"gloss": "Serpent", "#text": "There was a rock, not small in circumference, and very high. It was\nencompassed with valleys of such vast depth downward, that the eye could\nnot reach their bottoms; they were abrupt, and such as no animal could\nwalk upon, excepting at two places of the rock, where it subsides, in order\nto afford a passage for ascent, though not without difficulty. Now, of\nthe ways that lead to it, one is that from the lake Asphaltiris, towards\nthe sun-rising, and another on the west, where the ascent is easier: the\none of these ways is called the , as resembling that animal\nin its narrowness and its perpetual windings; for it is broken off at the\nprominent precipices of the rock, and returns frequently into itself, and\nlengthening again by little and little, hath much ado to proceed forward;\nand he that would walk along it must first go on one leg, and then on the\nother; there is also nothing but destruction, in case your feet slip; for\non each side there is a vastly deep chasm and precipice, sufficient to\nquell the courage of every body by the terror it infuses into the mind.\nWhen, therefore, a man hath gone along this way for thirty furlongs, the\nrest is the top of the hill - not ending at a small point, but is no other\nthan a plain upon the highest part of the mountain. Upon this top of the\nhill, Jonathan the high priest first of all built a fortress, and called\nit Masada: after which the rebuilding of this place employed the care of\nking Herod to a great degree; he also built a wall round about the entire\ntop of the hill, seven furlongs long; it was composed of white stone; its\nheight was twelve, and its breadth eight cubits; there were also erected\nupon that wall thirty-eight towers, each of them fifty cubits high; out\nof which you might pass into lesser edifices, which were built on the inside,\nround the entire wall; for the king reserved the top of the hill, which\nwas of a fat soil, and better mould than any valley for agriculture, that\nsuch as committed themselves to this fortress for their preservation might\nnot even there be quite destitute of food, in case they should ever be\nin want of it from abroad. Moreover, he built a palace therein at the western\nascent; it was within and beneath the walls of the citadel, but inclined\nto its north side. Now the wall of this palace was very high and strong,\nand had at its four corners towers sixty cubits high. The furniture also\nof the edifices, and of the cloisters, and of the baths, was of great variety,\nand very costly; and these buildings were supported by pillars of single\nstones on every side; the walls and also the floors of the edifices were\npaved with stones of several colors. He also had cut many and great pits,\nas reservoirs for water, out of the rocks, at every one of the places that\nwere inhabited, both above and round about the palace, and before the wall;\nand by this contrivance he endeavored to have water for several uses, as\nif there had been fountains there. Here was also a road digged from the\npalace, and leading to the very top of the mountain, which yet could not\nbe seen by such as were without [the walls]; nor indeed could enemies easily\nmake use of the plain roads; for the road on the east side, as we have\nalready taken notice, could not be walked upon, by reason of its nature;\nand for the western road, he built a large tower at its narrowest place,\nat no less a distance from the top of the hill than a thousand cubits;\nwhich tower could not possibly be passed by, nor could it be easily taken;\nnor indeed could those that walked along it without any fear (such was\nits contrivance) easily get to the end of it; and after such a manner was\nthis citadel fortified, both by nature and by the hands of men, in order\nto frustrate the attacks of enemies."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Pliny and others confirm this strange paradox, that provisions laid up\nagainst sieges will continue good for a hundred ears, as Spanheim notes\nupon this place."}, "#text": "As for the furniture that was within this fortress, it was still\nmore wonderful on account of its splendor and long continuance; for here\nwas laid up corn in large quantities, and such as would subsist men for\na long time; here was also wine and oil in abundance, with all kinds of\npulse and dates heaped up together; all which Eleazar found there, when\nhe and his Sicarii got possession of the fortress by treachery. These fruits\nwere also fresh and full ripe, and no way inferior to such fruits newly\nlaid in, although they were little short of a hundred years \nfrom the laying in these provisions [by Herod], till the place was taken\nby the Romans; nay, indeed, when the Romans got possession of those fruits\nthat were left, they found them not corrupted all that while; nor should\nwe be mistaken, if we supposed that the air was here the cause of their\nenduring so long; this fortress being so high, and so free from the mixture\nof all terrain and muddy particles of matter. There was also found here\na large quantity of all sorts of weapons of war, which had been treasured\nup by that king, and were sufficient for ten thousand men; there was east\niron, and brass, and tin, which show that he had taken much pains to have\nall things here ready for the greatest occasions; for the report goes how\nHerod thus prepared this fortress on his own account, as a refuge against\ntwo kinds of danger; the one for fear of the multitude of the Jews, lest\nthey should depose him, and restore their former kings to the government;\nthe other danger was greater and more terrible, which arose from Cleopatra\nqueen of Egypt, who did not conceal her intentions, but spoke often to\nAntony, and desired him to cut off Herod, and entreated him to bestow the\nkingdom of Judea upon her. And certainly it is a great wonder that Antony\ndid never comply with her commands in this point, as he was so miserably\nenslaved to his passion for her; nor should any one have been surprised\nif she had been gratified in such her request. So the fear of these dangers\nmade Herod rebuild Masada, and thereby leave it for the finishing stroke\nof the Romans in this Jewish war."}, "Since therefore the Roman commander Silva had now built a wall on\nthe outside, round about this whole place, as we have said already, and\nhad thereby made a most accurate provision to prevent any one of the besieged\nrunning away, he undertook the siege itself, though he found but one single\nplace that would admit of the banks he was to raise; for behind that tower\nwhich secured the road that led to the palace, and to the top of the hill\nfrom the west; there was a certain eminency of the rock, very broad and\nvery prominent, but three hundred cubits beneath the highest part of Masada;\nit was called the White Promontory. Accordingly, he got upon that part\nof the rock, and ordered the army to bring earth; and when they fell to\nthat work with alacrity, and abundance of them together, the bank was raised,\nand became solid for two hundred cubits in height. Yet was not this bank\nthought sufficiently high for the use of the engines that were to be set\nupon it; but still another elevated work of great stones compacted together\nwas raised upon that bank; this was fifty cubits, both in breadth and height.\nThe other machines that were now got ready were like to those that had\nbeen first devised by Vespasian, and afterwards by Titus, for sieges. There\nwas also a tower made of the height of sixty cubits, and all over plated\nwith iron, out of which the Romans threw darts and stones from the engines,\nand soon made those that fought from the walls of the place to retire,\nand would not let them lift up their heads above the works. At the same\ntime Silva ordered that great battering ram which he had made to be brought\nthither, and to be set against the wall, and to make frequent batteries\nagainst it, which with some difficulty broke down a part of the wall, and\nquite overthrew it. However, the Sicarii made haste, and presently built\nanother wall within that, which should not be liable to the same misfortune\nfrom the machines with the other; it was made soft and yielding, and so\nwas capable of avoiding the terrible blows that affected the other. It\nwas framed after the following manner: They laid together great beams of\nwood lengthways, one close to the end of another, and the same way in which\nthey were cut: there were two of these rows parallel to one another, and\nlaid at such a distance from each other as the breadth of the wall required,\nand earth was put into the space between those rows. Now, that the earth\nmight not fall away upon the elevation of this bank to a greater height,\nthey further laid other beams over cross them, and thereby bound those\nbeams together that lay lengthways. This work of theirs was like a real\nedifice; and when the machines were applied, the blows were weakened by\nits yielding; and as the materials by such concussion were shaken closer\ntogether, the pile by that means became firmer than before. When Silva\nsaw this, he thought it best to endeavor the taking of this wall by setting\nfire to it; so he gave order that the soldiers should throw a great number\nof burning torches upon it: accordingly, as it was chiefly made of wood,\nit soon took fire; and when it was once set on fire, its hollowness made\nthat fire spread to a mighty flame. Now, at the very beginning of this\nfire, a north wind that then blew proved terrible to the Romans; for by\nbringing the flame downward, it drove it upon them, and they were almost\nin despair of success, as fearing their machines would be burnt: but after\nthis, on a sudden the wind changed into the south, as if it were done by\nDivine Providence, and blew strongly the contrary way, and carried the\nflame, and drove it against the wall, which was now on fire through its\nentire thickness. So the Romans, having now assistance from God, returned\nto their camp with joy, and resolved to attack their enemies the very next\nday; on which occasion they set their watch more carefully that night,\nlest any of the Jews should run away from them without being discovered.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The speeches in this and the next section, as introduced under the person\nof this Eleazar, are exceeding remarkable, and oil the noblest subjects,\nthe contempt of death, and the dignity and immortality of the soul; and\nthat not only among the Jews, but among the Indians themselves also; and\nare highly worthy the perusal of all the curious. It seems as if that philosophic\nlady who survived, ch. 9. sect. 1, 2, remembered the substance of these\ndiscourses, as spoken by Eleazar, and so Josephus clothed them in his own\nwords: at the lowest they contain the Jewish notions on these heads, as\nunderstood then by our Josephus, and cannot but deserve a suitable regard\nfrom us."}, "#text": "However, neither did Eleazar once think of flying away, nor would\nhe permit any one else to do so; but when he saw their wall burned down\nby the fire, and could devise no other way of escaping, or room for their\nfurther courage, and setting before their eyes what the Romans would do\nto them, their children, and their wives, if they got them into their power,\nhe consulted about having them all slain. Now as he judged this to be the\nbest thing they could do in their present circumstances, he gathered the\nmost courageous of his companions together, and encouraged them to take\nthat course by a speech \nwhich he made to them in the manner following: \"Since we, long ago,\nmy generous friends, resolved never to be servants to the Romans, nor to\nany other than to God himself, who alone is the true and just Lord of mankind,\nthe time is now come that obliges us to make that resolution true in practice.\nAnd let us not at this time bring a reproach upon ourselves for self-contradiction,\nwhile we formerly would not undergo slavery, though it were then without\ndanger, but must now, together with slavery, choose such punishments also\nas are intolerable; I mean this, upon the supposition that the Romans once\nreduce us under their power while we are alive. We were the very first\nthat revolted from them, and we are the last that fight against them; and\nI cannot but esteem it as a favor that God hath granted us, that it is\nstill in our power to die bravely, and in a state of freedom, which hath\nnot been the case of others, who were conquered unexpectedly. It is very\nplain that we shall be taken within a day's time; but it is still an eligible\nthing to die after a glorious manner, together with our dearest friends.\nThis is what our enemies themselves cannot by any means hinder, although\nthey be very desirous to take us alive. Nor can we propose to ourselves\nany more to fight them, and beat them. It had been proper indeed for us\nto have conjectured at the purpose of God much sooner, and at the very\nfirst, when we were so desirous of defending our liberty, and when we received\nsuch sore treatment from one another, and worse treatment from our enemies,\nand to have been sensible that the same God, who had of old taken the Jewish\nnation into his favor, had now condemned them to destruction; for had he\neither continued favorable, or been but in a lesser degree displeased with\nus, he had not overlooked the destruction of so many men, or delivered\nhis most holy city to be burnt and demolished by our enemies. To be sure\nwe weakly hoped to have preserved ourselves, and ourselves alone, still\nin a state of freedom, as if we had been guilty of no sins ourselves against\nGod, nor been partners with those of others; we also taught other men to\npreserve their liberty. Wherefore, consider how God hath convinced us that\nour hopes were in vain, by bringing such distress upon us in the desperate\nstate we are now in, and which is beyond all our expectations; for the\nnature of this fortress which was in itself unconquerable, hath not proved\na means of our deliverance; and even while we have still great abundance\nof food, and a great quantity of arms, and other necessaries more than\nwe want, we are openly deprived by God himself of all hope of deliverance;\nfor that fire which was driven upon our enemies did not of its own accord\nturn back upon the wall which we had built; this was the effect of God's\nanger against us for our manifold sins, which we have been guilty of in\na most insolent and extravagant manner with regard to our own countrymen;\nthe punishments of which let us not receive from the Romans, but from God\nhimself, as executed by our own hands; for these will be more moderate\nthan the other. Let our wives die before they are abused, and our children\nbefore they have tasted of slavery; and after we have slain them, let us\nbestow that glorious benefit upon one another mutually, and preserve ourselves\nin freedom, as an excellent funeral monument for us. But first let us destroy\nour money and the fortress by fire; for I am well assured that this will\nbe a great grief to the Romans, that they shall not be able to seize upon\nour bodies, and shall fall of our wealth also; and let us spare nothing\nbut our provisions; for they will be a testimonial when we are dead that\nwe were not subdued for want of necessaries, but that, according to our\noriginal resolution, we have preferred death before slavery.\""}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "See B. II. ch. 20. sect. 2, where the number of the slain is but 10,000."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Reland here sets down a parallel aphorism of one of the Jewish Rabbins,\n\"We are born that we may die, and die that we may live.'"}], "#text": "This was Eleazar's speech to them. Yet did not the opinions of all\nthe auditors acquiesce therein; but although some of them were very zealous\nto put his advice in practice, and were in a manner filled with pleasure\nat it, and thought death to be a good thing, yet had those that were most\neffeminate a commiseration for their wives and families; and when these\nmen were especially moved by the prospect of their own certain death, they\nlooked wistfully at one another, and by the tears that were in their eyes\ndeclared their dissent from his opinion. When Eleazar saw these people\nin such fear, and that their souls were dejected at so prodigious a proposal,\nhe was afraid lest perhaps these effeminate persons should, by their lamentations\nand tears, enfeeble those that heard what he had said courageously; so\nhe did not leave off exhorting them, but stirred up himself, and recollecting\nproper arguments for raising their courage, he undertook to speak more\nbriskly and fully to them, and that concerning the immortality of the soul.\nSo he made a lamentable groan, and fixing his eyes intently on those that\nwept, he spake thus: \"Truly, I was greatly mistaken when I thought\nto be assisting to brave men who struggled hard for their liberty, and\nto such as were resolved either to live with honor, or else to die; but\nI find that you are such people as are no better than others, either in\nvirtue or in courage, and are afraid of dying, though you be delivered\nthereby from the greatest miseries, while you ought to make no delay in\nthis matter, nor to await any one to give you good advice; for the laws\nof our country, and of God himself, have from ancient times, and as soon\nas ever we could use our reason, continually taught us, and our forefathers\nhave corroborated the same doctrine by their actions, and by their bravery\nof mind, that it is life that is a calamity to men, and not death; for\nthis last affords our souls their liberty, and sends them by a removal\ninto their own place of purity, where they are to be insensible of all\nsorts of misery; for while souls are tied clown to a mortal body, they\nare partakers of its miseries; and really, to speak the truth, they are\nthemselves dead; for the union of what is divine to what is mortal is disagreeable.\nIt is true, the power of the soul is great, even when it is imprisoned\nin a mortal body; for by moving it after a way that is invisible, it makes\nthe body a sensible instrument, and causes it to advance further in its\nactions than mortal nature could otherwise do. However, when it is freed\nfrom that weight which draws it down to the earth and is connected with\nit, it obtains its own proper place, and does then become a partaker of\nthat blessed power, and those abilities, which are then every way incapable\nof being hindered in their operations. It continues invisible, indeed,\nto the eyes of men, as does God himself; for certainly it is not itself\nseen while it is in the body; for it is there after an invisible manner,\nand when it is freed from it, it is still not seen. It is this soul which\nhath one nature, and that an incorruptible one also; but yet it is the\ncause of the change that is made in the body; for whatsoever it be which\nthe soul touches, that lives and flourishes; and from whatsoever it is\nremoved, that withers away and dies; such a degree is there in it of immortality.\nLet me produce the state of sleep as a most evident demonstration of the\ntruth of what I say; wherein souls, when the body does not distract them,\nhave the sweetest rest depending on themselves, and conversing with God,\nby their alliance to him; they then go every where, and foretell many futurities\nbeforehand. And why are we afraid of death, while we are pleased with the\nrest that we have in sleep? And how absurd a thing is it to pursue after\nliberty while we are alive, and yet to envy it to ourselves where it will\nbe eternal! We, therefore, who have been brought up in a discipline of\nour own, ought to become an example to others of our readiness to die.\nYet, if we do stand in need of foreigners to support us in this matter,\nlet us regard those Indians who profess the exercise of philosophy; for\nthese good men do but unwillingly undergo the time of life, and look upon\nit as a necessary servitude, and make haste to let their souls loose from\ntheir bodies; nay, when no misfortune presses them to it, nor drives them\nupon it, these have such a desire of a life of immortality, that they tell\nother men beforehand that they are about to depart; and nobody hinders\nthem, but every one thinks them happy men, and gives them letters to be\ncarried to their familiar friends [that are dead], so firmly and certainly\ndo they believe that souls converse with one another [in the other world].\nSo when these men have heard all such commands that were to be given them,\nthey deliver their body to the fire; and, in order to their getting their\nsoul a separation from the body in the greatest purity, they die in the\nmidst of hymns of commendations made to them; for their dearest friends\nconduct them to their death more readily than do any of the rest of mankind\nconduct their fellow-citizens when they are going a very long journey,\nwho at the same time weep on their own account, but look upon the others\nas happy persons, as so soon to be made partakers of the immortal order\nof beings. Are not we, therefore, ashamed to have lower notions than the\nIndians? and by our own cowardice to lay a base reproach upon the laws\nof our country, which are so much desired and imitated by all mankind?\nBut put the case that we had been brought up under another persuasion,\nand taught that life is the greatest good which men are capable of, and\nthat death is a calamity; however, the circumstances we are now in ought\nto he an inducement to us to bear such calamity courageously, since it\nis by the will of God, and by necessity, that we are to die; for it now\nappears that God hath made such a decree against the whole Jewish nation,\nthat we are to be deprived of this life which [he knew] we would not make\na due use of. For do not you ascribe the occasion of our present condition\nto yourselves, nor think the Romans are the true occasion that this war\nwe have had with them is become so destructive to us all: these things\nhave not come to pass by their power, but a more powerful cause hath intervened,\nand made us afford them an occasion of their appearing to be conquerors\nover us. What Roman weapons, I pray you, were those by which the Jews at\nCesarea were slain? On the contrary, when they were no way disposed to\nrebel, but were all the while keeping their seventh day festival, and did\nnot so much as lift up their hands against the citizens of Cesarea, yet\ndid those citizens run upon them in great crowds, and cut their throats,\nand the throats of their wives and children, and this without any regard\nto the Romans themselves, who never took us for their enemies till we revolted\nfrom them. But some may be ready to say, that truly the people of Cesarea\nhad always a quarrel against those that lived among them, and that when\nan opportunity offered itself, they only satisfied the old rancor they\nhad against them. What then shall we say to those of Scythopolis, who ventured\nto wage war with us on account of the Greeks? Nor did they do it by way\nof revenge upon the Romans, when they acted in concert with our countrymen.\nWherefore you see how little our good-will and fidelity to them profiled\nus, while they were slain, they and their whole families, after the most\ninhuman manner, which was all the requital that was made them for the assistance\nthey had afforded the others; for that very same destruction which they\nhad prevented from falling upon the others did they suffer themselves from\nthem, as if they had been ready to be the actors against them. It would\nbe too long for me to speak at this time of every destruction brought upon\nus; for you cannot but know that there was not any one Syrian city which\ndid not slay their Jewish inhabitants, and were not more bitter enemies\nto us than were the Romans themselves; nay, even those of Damascus, \nwhen they were able to allege no tolerable pretense against us, filled\ntheir city with the most barbarous slaughters of our people, and cut the\nthroats of eighteen thousand Jews, with their wives and children. And as\nto the multitude of those that were slain in Egypt, and that with torments\nalso, we have been informed they were more than sixty thousand; those indeed\nbeing in a foreign country, and so naturally meeting with nothing to oppose\nagainst their enemies, were killed in the manner forementioned. As for\nall those of us who have waged war against the Romans in our own country,\nhad we not sufficient reason to have sure hopes of victory? For we had\narms, and walls, and fortresses so prepared as not to be easily taken,\nand courage not to be moved by any dangers in the cause of liberty, which\nencouraged us all to revolt from the Romans. But then these advantages\nsufficed us but for a short time, and only raised our hopes, while they\nreally appeared to be the origin of our miseries; for all we had hath been\ntaken from us, and all hath fallen under our enemies, as if these advantages\nwere only to render their victory over us the more glorious, and were not\ndisposed for the preservation of those by whom these preparations were\nmade. And as for those that are already dead in the war, it is reasonable\nwe should esteem them blessed, for they are dead in defending, and not\nin betraying their liberty; but as to the multitude of those that are now\nunder the Romans, who would not pity their condition? and who would not\nmake haste to die, before he would suffer the same miseries with them?\nSome of them have been put upon the rack, and tortured with fire and whippings,\nand so died. Some have been half devoured by wild beasts, and yet have\nbeen reserved alive to be devoured by them a second time, in order to afford\nlaughter and sport to our enemies; and such of those as are alive still\nare to be looked on as the most miserable, who, being so desirous of death,\ncould not come at it. And where is now that great city, the metropolis\nof the Jewish nation, which vas fortified by so many walls round about,\nwhich had so many fortresses and large towers to defend it, which could\nhardly contain the instruments prepared for the war, and which had so many\nten thousands of men to fight for it? Where is this city that was believed\nto have God himself inhabiting therein? It is now demolished to the very\nfoundations, and hath nothing but that monument of it preserved, I mean\nthe camp of those that hath destroyed it, which still dwells upon its ruins;\nsome unfortunate old men also lie upon the ashes of the temple, and a few\nwomen are there preserved alive by the enemy, for our bitter shame and\nreproach. Now who is there that revolves these things in his mind, and\nyet is able to bear the sight of the sun, though he might live out of danger?\nWho is there so much his country's enemy, or so unmanly, and so desirous\nof living, as not to repent that he is still alive? And I cannot but wish\nthat we had all died before we had seen that holy city demolished by the\nhands of our enemies, or the foundations of our holy temple dug up after\nso profane a manner. But since we had a generous hope that deluded us,\nas if we might perhaps have been able to avenge ourselves on our enemies\non that account, though it be now become vanity, and hath left us alone\nin this distress, let us make haste to die bravely. Let us pity ourselves,\nour children, and our wives while it is in our own power to show pity to\nthem; for we were born to die, \nas well as those were whom we have begotten; nor is it in the power of\nthe most happy of our race to avoid it. But for abuses, and slavery, and\nthe sight of our wives led away after an ignominious manner, with their\nchildren, these are not such evils as are natural and necessary among men;\nalthough such as do not prefer death before those miseries, when it is\nin their power so to do, must undergo even them, on account of their own\ncowardice. We revolted from the Romans with great pretensions to courage;\nand when, at the very last, they invited us to preserve ourselves, we would\nnot comply with them. Who will not, therefore, believe that they will certainly\nbe in a rage at us, in case they can take us alive? Miserable will then\nbe the young men who will be strong enough in their bodies to sustain many\ntorments! miserable also will be those of elder years, who will not be\nable to bear those calamities which young men might sustain! One man will\nbe obliged to hear the voice of his son implore help of his father, when\nhis hands are bound. But certainly our hands are still at liberty, and\nhave a sword in them; let them then be subservient to us in our glorious\ndesign; let us die before we become slaves under our eneimies, and let\nus go out of the world, together with our children and our wives, in a\nstate of freedom. This it is that our laws command us to do this it is\nthat our wives and children crave at our hands; nay, God himself hath brought\nthis necessity upon us; while the Romans desire the contrary, and are afraid\nlest any of us should die before we are taken. Let us therefore make haste,\nand instead of affording them so much pleasure, as they hope for in getting\nus under their power, let us leave them an example which shall at once\ncause their astonishment at our death, and their admiration of our hardiness\ntherein.\""}, "NOW as Eleazar was proceeding on in this exhortation, they all cut\nhim off short, and made haste to do the work, as full of an unconquerable\nardor of mind, and moved with a demoniacal fury. So they went their ways,\nas one still endeavoring to be before another, and as thinking that this\neagerness would be a demonstration of their courage and good conduct, if\nthey could avoid appearing in the last class; so great was the zeal they\nwere in to slay their wives and children, and themselves also! Nor indeed,\nwhen they came to the work itself, did their courage fail them, as one\nmight imagine it would have done, but they then held fast the same resolution,\nwithout wavering, which they had upon the hearing of Eleazar's speech,\nwhile yet every one of them still retained the natural passion of love\nto themselves and their families, because the reasoning they went upon\nappeared to them to be very just, even with regard to those that were dearest\nto them; for the husbands tenderly embraced their wives, and took their\nchildren into their arms, and gave the longest parting kisses to them,\nwith tears in their eyes. Yet at the same time did they complete what they\nhad resolved on, as if they had been executed by the hands of strangers;\nand they had nothing else for their comfort but the necessity they were\nin of doing this execution, to avoid that prospect they had of the miseries\nthey were to suffer from their enemies. Nor was there at length any one\nof these men found that scrupled to act their part in this terrible execution,\nbut every one of them despatched his dearest relations. Miserable men indeed\nwere they! whose distress forced them to slay their own wives and children\nwith their own hands, as the lightest of those evils that were before them.\nSo they being not able to bear the grief they were under for what they\nhad done any longer, and esteeming it an injury to those they had slain,\nto live even the shortest space of time after them, they presently laid\nall they had upon a heap, and set fire to it. They then chose ten men by\nlot out of them to slay all the rest; every one of whom laid himself down\nby his wife and children on the ground, and threw his arms about them,\nand they offered their necks to the stroke of those who by lot executed\nthat melancholy office; and when these ten had, without fear, slain them\nall, they made the same rule for casting lots for themselves, that he whose\nlot it was should first kill the other nine, and after all should kill\nhimself. Accordingly, all these had courage sufficient to be no way behind\none another in doing or suffering; so, for a conclusion, the nine offered\ntheir necks to the executioner, and he who was the last of all took a view\nof all the other bodies, lest perchance some or other among so many that\nwere slain should want his assistance to be quite despatched, and when\nhe perceived that they were all slain, he set fire to the palace, and with\nthe great force of his hand ran his sword entirely through himself, and\nfell down dead near to his own relations. So these people died with this\nintention, that they would not leave so much as one soul among them all\nalive to be subject to the Romans. Yet was there an ancient woman, and\nanother who was of kin to Eleazar, and superior to most women in prudence\nand learning, with five children, who had concealed themselves in caverns\nunder ground, and had carried water thither for their drink, and were hidden\nthere when the rest were intent upon the slaughter of one another. Those\nothers were nine hundred and sixty in number, the women and children being\nwithal included in that computation. This calamitous slaughter was made\non the fifteenth day of the month Xanthicus [Nisan].", "Now for the Romans, they expected that they should be fought in the\nmorning, when, accordingly, they put on their armor, and laid bridges of\nplanks upon their ladders from their banks, to make an assault upon the\nfortress, which they did; but saw nobody as an enemy, but a terrible solitude\non every side, with a fire within the place, as well as a perfect silence.\nSo they were at a loss to guess at what had happened. At length they made\na shout, as if it had been at a blow given by the battering ram, to try\nwhether they could bring any one out that was within; the women heard this\nnoise, and came out of their under-ground cavern, and informed the Romans\nwhat had been done, as it was done; and the second of them clearly described\nall both what was said and what was done, and this manner of it; yet did\nthey not easily give their attention to such a desperate undertaking, and\ndid not believe it could be as they said; they also attempted to put the\nfire out, and quickly cutting themselves a way through it, they came within\nthe palace, and so met with the multitude of the slain, but could take\nno pleasure in the fact, though it were done to their enemies. Nor could\nthey do other than wonder at the courage of their resolution, and the immovable\ncontempt of death which so great a number of them had shown, when they\nwent through with such an action as that was.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Since Josephus here informs us that some of these Sicarii, or ruffians,\nwent from Alexandria (which was itself in Egypt, in a large sense) into\nEgypt, and Thebes there situated, Reland well observes, from Vossius, that\nEgypt sometimes denotes Proper or Upper Egypt, as distinct from the Delta,\nand the lower parts near Palestine. Accordingly, as he adds, those that\nsay it never rains in Egypt must mean the Proper or Upper Egypt, because\nit does sometimes rain in the other parts. See the note on Antiq. B.

But when part of the Jews of reputation\nopposed them, they slew some of them, and with the others they were very\npressing in their exhortations to revolt from the Romans; but when the\nprincipal men of the senate saw what madness they were come to, they thought\nit no longer safe for themselves to overlook them. So they got all the\nJews together to an assembly, and accused the madness of the Sicarii, and\ndemonstrated that they had been the authors of all the evils that had come\nupon them. They said also that \"these men, now they were run away\nfrom Judea, having no sure hope of escaping, because as soon as ever they\nshall be known, they will be soon destroyed by the Romans, they come hither\nand fill us full of those calamities which belong to them, while we have\nnot been partakers with them in any of their sins.\" Accordingly, they\nexhorted the multitude to have a care, lest they should be brought to destruction\nby their means, and to make their apology to the Romans for what had been\ndone, by delivering these men up to them; who being thus apprized of the\ngreatness of the danger they were in, complied with what was proposed,\nand ran with great violence upon the Sicarii, and seized upon them; and\nindeed six hundred of them were caught immediately: but as to all those\nthat fled into Egypt \nand to the Egyptian Thebes, it was not long ere they were caught also,\nand brought back, whose courage, or whether we ought to call it madness,\nor hardiness in their opinions, every body was amazed at. For when all\nsorts of torments and vexations of their bodies that could be devised were\nmade use of to them, they could not get any one of them to comply so far\nas to confess, or seem to confess, that Caesar was their lord; but they\npreserved their own opinion, in spite of all the distress they were brought\nto, as if they received these torments and the fire itself with bodies\ninsensible of pain, and with a soul that in a manner rejoiced under them.\nBut what was most of all astonishing to the beholders was the courage of\nthe children; for not one of these children was so far overcome by these\ntorments, as to name Caesar for their lord. So far does the strength of\nthe courage [of the soul] prevail over the weakness of the body."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Of this temple of Onias's building in Egypt, see the notes on Antiq.

XII. ch. 9. sect. 7, during the lifetime of\nthat Antiochus, it is probable he petitioned, and perhaps obtained his\nleave then, though it were not actually built or finished till fifteen\nyears afterward."}, "#text": "So Ptolemy complied with his proposals, and gave him a place one\nhundred and eighty furlongs distant from Memphis. \nThat Nomos was called the Nomos of Hellopolls, where Onias built a fortress\nand a temple, not like to that at Jerusalem, but such as resembled a tower.\nHe built it of large stones to the height of sixty cubits; he made the\nstructure of the altar in imitation of that in our own country, and in\nlike manner adorned with gifts, excepting the make of the candlestick,\nfor he did not make a candlestick, but had a [single] lamp hammered out\nof a piece of gold, which illuminated the place with its rays, and which\nhe hung by a chain of gold; but the entire temple was encompassed with\na wall of burnt brick, though it had gates of stone. The king also gave\nhim a large country for a revenue in money, that both the priests might\nhave a plentiful provision made for them, and that God might have great\nabundance of what things were necessary for his worship. Yet did not Onias\ndo this out of a sober disposition, but he had a mind to contend with the\nJews at Jerusalem, and could not forget the indignation he had for being\nbanished thence. Accordingly, he thought that by building this temple he\nshould draw away a great number from them to himself. There had been also\na certain ancient prediction made by [a prophet] whose name was Isaiah,\nabout six hundred years before, that this temple should be built by a man\nthat was a Jew in Egypt. And this is the history of the building of that\ntemple."}, "And now Lupus, the governor of Alexandria, upon the receipt of Caesar's\nletter, came to the temple, and carried out of it some of the donations\ndedicated thereto, and shut up the temple itself. And as Lupus died a little\nafterward, Paulinns succeeded him. This man left none of those donations\nthere, and threatened the priests severely if they did not bring them all\nout; nor did he permit any who were desirous of worshipping God there so\nmuch as to come near the whole sacred place; but when he had shut up the\ngates, he made it entirely inaccessible, insomuch that there remained no\nlonger the least footsteps of any Divine worship that had been in that\nplace. Now the duration of the time from the building of this temple till\nit was shut up again was three hundred and forty-three years.", "AND now did the madness of the Sicarii, like a disease, reach as\nfar as the cities of Cyrene; for one Jonathan, a vile person, and by trade\na weaver, came thither and prevailed with no small number of the poorer\nsort to give ear to him; he also led them into the desert, upon promising\nthem that he would show them signs and apparitions. And as for the other\nJews of Cyrene, he concealed his knavery from them, and put tricks upon\nthem; but those of the greatest dignity among them informed Catullus, the\ngovernor of the Libyan Pentapolis, of his march into the desert, and of\nthe preparations he had made for it. So he sent out after him both horsemen\nand footmen, and easily overcame them, because they were unarmed men; of\nthese many were slain in the fight, but some were taken alive, and brought\nto Catullus. As for Jonathan, the head of this plot, he fled away at that\ntime; but upon a great and very diligent search, which was made all the\ncountry over for him, he was at last taken. And when he was brought to\nCatullus, he devised a way whereby he both escaped punishment himself,\nand afforded an occasion to Catullus of doing much mischief; for he falsely\naccused the richest men among the Jews, and said that they had put him\nupon what he did.", "Now Catullus easily admitted of these his calumnies, and aggravated\nmatters greatly, and made tragical exclamations, that he might also be\nsupposed to have had a hand in the finishing of the Jewish war. But what\nwas still harder, he did not only give a too easy belief to his stories,\nbut he taught the Sicarii to accuse men falsely. He bid this Jonathan,\ntherefore, to name one Alexander, a Jew (with whom he had formerly had\na quarrel, and openly professed that he hated him); he also got him to\nname his wife Bernice, as concerned with him. These two Catullus ordered\nto be slain in the first place; nay, after them he caused all the rich\nand wealthy Jews to be slain, being no fewer in all than three thousand.\nThis he thought he might do safely, because he confiscated their effects,\nand added them to Caesar's revenues.", "Nay, indeed, lest any Jews that lived elsewhere should convict him\nof his villainy, he extended his false accusations further, and persuaded\nJonathan, and certain others that were caught with him, to bring an accusation\nof attempts for innovation against the Jews that were of the best character\nboth at Alexandria and at Rome. One of these, against whom this treacherous\naccusation was laid, was Josephus, the writer of these books. However,\nthis plot, thus contrived by Catullus, did not succeed according to his\nhopes; for though he came himself to Rome, and brought Jonathan and his\ncompanions along with him in bonds, and thought he should have had no further\ninquisition made as to those lies that were forged under his government,\nor by his means; yet did Vespasian suspect the matter and made an inquiry\nhow far it was true. And when he understood that the accusation laid against\nthe Jews was an unjust one, he cleared them of the crimes charged upon\nthem, and this on account of Titus's concern about the matter, and brought\na deserved punishment upon Jonathan; for he was first tormented, and then\nburnt alive.", "But as to Catullus, the emperors Were so gentle to him, that he underwent\nno severe condemnation at this time; yet was it not long before he fell\ninto a complicated and almost incurable distemper, and died miserably.\nHe was not only afflicted in body, but the distemper in his mind was more\nheavy upon him than the other; for he was terribly disturbed, and continually\ncried out that he saw the ghosts of those whom he had slain standing before\nhim. Whereupon he was not able to contain himself, but leaped out of his\nbed, as if both torments and fire were brought to him. This his distemper\ngrew still a great deal worse and worse continually, and his very entrails\nwere so corroded, that they fell out of his body, and in that condition\nhe died. Thus he became as great an instance of Divine Providence as ever\nwas, and demonstrated that God punishes wicked men.", "And here we shall put an end to this our history; wherein we formerly\npromised to deliver the same with all accuracy, to such as should be desirous\nof understanding after what manner this war of the Romans with the Jews\nwas managed. Of which history, how good the style is, must be left to the\ndetermination of the readers; but as for its agreement with the facts,\nI shall not scruple to say, and that boldly, that truth hath been what\nI have alone aimed at through its entire composition."]}]}}}}
