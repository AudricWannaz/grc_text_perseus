I yielded to this man's persuasions, who always excites such\nas have abilities in what is useful and acceptable, to join their endeavors\nwith his. I was also ashamed myself to permit any laziness of disposition\nto have a greater influence upon me, than the delight of taking pains in\nsuch studies as were very useful: I thereupon stirred up myself, and went\non with my work more cheerfully. Besides the foregoing motives, I had others\nwhich I greatly reflected on; and these were, that our forefathers were\nwilling to communicate such things to others; and that some of the Greeks\ntook considerable pains to know the affairs of our nation."}, {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7002256", "#text": "Alexandria"}, "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Josephus here plainly alludes to the famous Greek proverb, If God be with\nus, every thing that is impossible becomes possible."}, "#text": "I found, therefore, that the second of the Ptolemies was a king who\nwas extraordinarily diligent in what concerned learning, and the collection\nof books; that he was also peculiarly ambitious to procure a translation\nof our law, and of the constitution of our government therein contained,\ninto the Greek tongue. Now Eleazar the high priest, one not inferior to\nany other of that dignity among us, did not envy the forenamed king the\nparticipation of that advantage, which otherwise he would for certain have\ndenied him, but that he knew the custom of our nation was, to hinder nothing\nof what we esteemed ourselves from being communicated to others. Accordingly,\nI thought it became me both to imitate the generosity of our high priest,\nand to suppose there might even now be many lovers of learning like the\nking; for he did not obtain all our writings at that time; but those who\nwere sent to  as interpreters, gave him only the books of the\nlaw, while there were a vast number of other matters in our sacred books.\nThey, indeed, contain in them the history of five thousand years; in which\ntime happened many strange accidents, many chances of war, and great actions\nof the commanders, and mutations of the form of our government. Upon the\nwhole, a man that will peruse this history, may principally learn from\nit, that all events succeed well, even to an incredible degree, and the\nreward of felicity is proposed by God; but then it is to those that follow\nhis will, and do not venture to break his excellent laws: and that so far\nas men any way apostatize from the accurate observation of them, what was\npractical before becomes impracticable \nand whatsoever they set about as a good thing, is converted into an incurable\ncalamity. And now I exhort all those that peruse these books, to apply\ntheir minds to God; and to examine the mind of our legislator, whether\nhe hath not understood his nature in a manner worthy of him; and hath not\never ascribed to him such operations as become his power, and hath not\npreserved his writings from those indecent fables which others have framed,\nalthough, by the great distance of time when he lived, he might have securely\nforged such lies; for he lived two thousand years ago; at which vast distance\nof ages the poets themselves have not been so hardy as to fix even the\ngenerations of their gods, much less the actions of their men, or their\nown laws. As I proceed, therefore, I shall accurately describe what is\ncontained in our records, in the order of time that belongs to them; for\nI have already promised so to do throughout this undertaking; and this\nwithout adding any thing to what is therein contained, or taking away any\nthing therefrom."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "As to this intended work of Josephus concerning the reasons of many of\nthe Jewish laws, and what philosophical or allegorical sense they would\nbear, the loss of which work is by some of the learned not much regretted,\nI am inclinable, in part, to Fabricius's opinion, ap.

Now\nwhen Moses was desirous to teach this lesson to his countrymen, he did\nnot begin the establishment of his laws after the same manner that other\nlegislators did; I mean, upon contracts and other rights between one man\nand another, but by raising their minds upwards to regard God, and his\ncreation of the world; and by persuading them, that we men are the most\nexcellent of the creatures of God upon earth. Now when once he had brought\nthem to submit to religion, he easily persuaded them to submit in all other\nthings: for as to other legislators, they followed fables, and by their\ndiscourses transferred the most reproachful of human vices unto the gods,\nand afforded wicked men the most plausible excuses for their crimes; but\nas for our legislator, when he had once demonstrated that God was possessed\nof perfect virtue, he supposed that men also ought to strive after the\nparticipation of it; and on those who did not so think, and so believe,\nhe inflicted the severest punishments. I exhort, therefore, my readers\nto examine this whole undertaking in that view; for thereby it will appear\nto them, that there is nothing therein disagreeable either to the majesty\nof God, or to his love to mankind; for all things have here a reference\nto the nature of the universe; while our legislator speaks some things\nwisely, but enigmatically, and others under a decent allegory, but still\nexplains such things as required a direct explication plainly and expressly.\nHowever, those that have a mind to know the reasons of every thing, may\nfind here a very curious philosophical theory, which I now indeed shall\nwave the explication of; but if God afford me time for it, I will set about\nwriting it \nafter I have finished the present work.

He said, he saw the last night,\nthat his wheat-sheaf stood still in the place where he set it, but that\ntheir sheaves ran to bow down to it, as servants bow down to their masters.\nBut as soon as they perceived the vision foretold that he should obtain\npower and great wealth, and that his power should be in opposition to them,\nthey gave no interpretation of it to Joseph, as if the dream were not by\nthem undestood: but they prayed that no part of what they suspected to\nbe its meaning might come to pass; and they bare a still greater hatred\nto him on that account.", "But God, in opposition to their envy, sent a second vision to Joseph,\nwhich was much more wonderful than the former; for it seemed to him that\nthe sun took with him the moon, and the rest of the stars, and came down\nto the earth, and bowed down to him. He told the vision to his father,\nand that, as suspecting nothing of ill-will from his brethren, when they\nwere there also, and desired him to interpret what it should signify. Now\nJacob was pleased with the dream: for, considering the prediction in his\nmind, and shrewdly and wisely guessing at its meaning, he rejoiced at the\ngreat things thereby signified, because it declared the future happiness\nof his son; and that, by the blessing of God, the time would come when\nhe should be honored, and thought worthy of worship by his parents and\nbrethren, as guessing that the moon and sun were like his mother and father;\nthe former, as she that gave increase and nourishment to all things; and\nthe latter, he that gave form and other powers to them; and that the stars\nwere like his brethren, since they were eleven in number, as were the stars\nthat receive their power from the sun and moon.", {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,1099904", "#text": "Shechem"}, "#text": "And thus did Jacob make a judgment of this vision, and that a shrewd\none also. But these interpretations caused very great grief to Joseph's\nbrethren; and they were affected to him hereupon as if he were a certain\nstranger, that was to those good things which were signified by the dreams\nand not as one that was a brother, with whom it was probable they should\nbe joint-partakers; and as they had been partners in the same parentage,\nso should they be of the same happiness. They also resolved to kill the\nlad; and having fully ratified that intention of theirs, as soon as their\ncollection of the fruits was over, they went to , which is a country\ngood for feeding of cattle, and for pasturage; there they fed their flocks,\nwithout acquainting their father with their removal thither; whereupon\nhe had melancholy suspicions about them, as being ignorant of his sons'\ncondition, and receiving no messenger from the flocks that could inform\nhim of the true state they were in; so, because he was in great fear about\nthem, he sent Joseph to the flocks, to learn the circumstances his brethren\nwere in, and to bring him word how they did."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "We\nmay here observe, that in correspondence to Joseph's second dream, which\nimplied that his mother, who was then alive, as well as his father, should\ncome and bow down to him, Josephus represents her here as still alive after\nshe was dead, for the decorum of the dream that foretold it, as the interpretation\nof the dream does also in all our copies, Genesis 37:10."}, "#text": "NOW these brethren rejoiced as soon as they saw their brother coming\nto them, not indeed as at the presence of a near relation, or as at the\npresence of one sent by their father, but as at the presence of an enemy,\nand one that by Divine Providence was delivered into their hands; and they\nalready resolved to kill him, and not let slip the opportunity that lay\nbefore them. But when Reubel, the eldest of them, saw them thus disposed,\nand that they had agreed together to execute their purpose, he tried to\nrestrain them, showing them the heinous enterprise they were going about,\nand the horrid nature of it; that this action would appear wicked in the\nsight of God, and impious before men, even though they should kill one\nnot related to them; but much more flagitious and detestable to appear\nto have slain their own brother, by which act the father must be treated\nunjustly in the son's slaughter, and the mother \nalso be in perplexity while she laments that her son is taken away from\nher, and this not in a natural way neither. So he entreated them to have\na regard to their own consciences, and wisely to consider what mischief\nwould betide them upon the death of so good a child, and their youngest\nbrother; that they would also fear God, who was already both a spectator\nand a witness of the designs they had against their brother; that he would\nlove them if they abstained from this act, and yielded to repentance and\namendment; but in case they proceeded to do the fact, all sorts of punishments\nwould overtake them from God for this murder of their brother, since they\npolluted his providence, which was every where present, and which did not\noverlook what was done, either in deserts or in cities; for wheresoever\na man is, there ought he to suppose that God is also. He told them further,\nthat their consciences would be their enemies, if they attempted to go\nthrough so wicked an enterprise, which they can never avoid, whether it\nbe a good conscience; or whether it be such a one as they will have within\nthem when once they have killed their brother. He also added this besides\nto what he had before said, that it was not a righteous thing to kill a\nbrother, though he had injured them; that it is a good thing to forget\nthe actions of such near friends, even in things wherein they might seem\nto have offended; but that they were going to kill Joseph, who had been\nguilty of nothing that was ill towards them, in whose case the infirmity\nof his small age should rather procure him mercy, and move them to unite\ntogether in the care of his preservation. That the cause of killing him\nmade the act itself much worse, while they determined to take him off out\nof envy at his future prosperity, an equal share of which they would naturally\npartake while he enjoyed it, since they were to him not strangers, but\nthe nearest relations, for they might reckon upon what God bestowed upon\nJoseph as their own; and that it was fit for them to believe, that the\nanger of God would for this cause be more severe upon them, if they slew\nhim who was judged by God to be worthy of that prosperity which was to\nbe hoped for; and while, by murdering him, they made it impossible for\nGod to bestow it upon him."}, "Reubel said these and many other things, and used entreaties to them,\nand thereby endeavored to divert them from the murder of their brother.\nBut when he saw that his discourse had not mollified them at all, and that\nthey made haste to do the fact, he advised them to alleviate the wickedness\nthey were going about, in the manner of taking Joseph off; for as he had\nexhorted them first, when they were going to revenge themselves, to be\ndissuaded from doing it; so, since the sentence for killing their brother\nhad prevailed, he said that they would not, however, be so grossly guilty,\nif they would be persuaded to follow his present advice, which would include\nwhat they were so eager about, but was not so very bad, but, in the distress\nthey were in, of a lighter nature. He begged of them, therefore, not to\nkill their brother with their own hands, but to cast him into the pit that\nwas hard by, and so to let him die; by which they would gain so much, that\nthey would not defile their own hands with his blood. To this the young\nmen readily agreed; so Reubel took the lad and tied him to a cord, and\nlet him down gently into the pit, for it had no water at all in it; who,\nwhen he had done this, went his way to seek for such pasturage as was fit\nfor feeding his flocks.", {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,2349356", "#text": "Gilead"}, "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The\nSeptuagint have twenty pieces of gold; the Testament of Gad thirty; the\nHebrew and Samaritan twenty of silver; and the vulgar Latin thirty.

This, therefore, was resolved on; so they drew\nJoseph up out of the pit, and sold him to the merchants for twenty pounds\n He was\nnow seventeen years old. But Reubel, coming in the night-time to the pit,\nresolved to save Joseph, without the privity of his brethren; and when,\nupon his calling to him, he made no answer, he was afraid that they had\ndestroyed him after he was gone; of which he complained to his brethren;\nbut when they had told him what they had done, Reubel left off his mourning."}, "When Joseph's brethren had done thus to him, they considered what\nthey should do to escape the suspicions of their father. Now they had taken\naway from Joseph the coat which he had on when he came to them at the time\nthey let him down into the pit; so they thought proper to tear that coat\nto pieces, and to dip it into goats' blood, and then to carry it and show\nit to their father, that he might believe he was destroyed by wild beasts.\nAnd when they had so done, they came to the old man, but this not till\nwhat had happened to his son had already come to his knowledge. Then they\nsaid that they had not seen Joseph, nor knew what mishap had befallen him;\nbut that they had found his coat bloody and torn to pieces, whence they\nhad a suspicion that he had fallen among wild beasts, and so perished,\nif that was the coat he had on when he came from home. Now Jacob had before\nsome better hopes that his son was only made a captive; but now he laid\naside that notion, and supposed that this coat was an evident argument\nthat he was dead, for he well remembered that this was the coat he had\non when he sent him to his brethren; so he hereafter lamented the lad as\nnow dead, and as if he had been the father of no more than one, without\ntaking any comfort in the rest; and so he was also affected with his misfortune\nbefore he met with Joseph's brethren, when he also conjectured that Joseph\nwas destroyed by wild beasts. He sat down also clothed in sackcloth and\nin heavy affliction, insomuch that he found no ease when his sons comforted\nhim, neither did his pains remit by length of time.", "NOW Potiphar, an Egyptian, who was chief cook to king Pharaoh, bought\nJoseph of the merchants, who sold him to him. He had him in the greatest\nhonor, and taught him the learning that became a free man, and gave him\nleave to make use of a diet better than was allotted to slaves. He intrusted\nalso the care of his house to him. So he enjoyed these advantages, yet\ndid not he leave that virtue which he had before, upon such a change of\nhis condition; but he demonstrated that wisdom was able to govern the uneasy\npassions of life, in such as have it in reality, and do not only put it\non for a show, under a present state of prosperity.", "For when his master's wife was fallen in love with him, both on account\nof his beauty of body, and his dexterous management of affairs; and supposed,\nthat if she should make it known to him, she could easily persuade him\nto come and lie with her, and that he would look upon it as a piece of\nhappy fortune that his mistress should entreat him, as regarding that state\nof slavery he was in, and not his moral character, which continued after\nhis condition was changed. So she made known her naughty inclinations,\nand spake to him about lying with her. However, he rejected her entreaties,\nnot thinking it agreeable to religion to yield so far to her, as to do\nwhat would tend to the affront and injury of him that purchased him, and\nhad vouchsafed him so great honors. He, on the contrary, exhorted her to\ngovern that passion; and laid before her the impossibility of her obtaining\nher desires, which he thought might be conquered, if she had no hope of\nsucceeding; and he said, that as to himself, he would endure any thing\nwhatever before he would be persuaded to it; for although it was fit for\na slave, as he was, to do nothing contrary to his mistress, he might well\nbe excused in a case where the contradiction was to such sort of commands\nonly. But this opposition of Joseph, when she did not expect it, made her\nstill more violent in her love to him; and as she was sorely beset with\nthis naughty passion, so she resolved to compass her design by a second\nattempt.", "When, therefore, there was a public festival coming on, in which\nit was the custom for women to come to the public solemnity; she pretended\nto her husband that she was sick, as contriving an opportunity for solitude\nand leisure, that she might entreat Joseph again. Which opportunity being\nobtained, she used more kind words to him than before; and said that it\nhad been good for him to have yielded to her first solicitation, and to\nhave given her no repulse, both because of the reverence he ought to bear\nto her dignity who solicited him, and because of the vehemence of her passion,\nby which she was forced though she were his mistress to condescend beneath\nher dignity; but that he may now, by taking more prudent advice, wipe off\nthe imputation of his former folly; for whether it were that he expected\nthe repetition of her solicitations she had now made, and that with greater\nearnestness than before, for that she had pretended sickness on this very\naccount, and had preferred his conversation before the festival and its\nsolemnity; or whether he opposed her former discourses, as not believing\nshe could be in earnest; she now gave him sufficient security, by thus\nrepeating her application, that she meant not in the least by fraud to\nimpose upon him; and assured him, that if he complied with her affections,\nhe might expect the enjoyment of the advantages he already had; and if\nhe were submissive to her, he should have still greater advantages; but\nthat he must look for revenge and hatred from her, in case he rejected\nher desires, and preferred the reputation of chastity before his mistress;\nfor that he would gain nothing by such procedure, because she would then\nbecome his accuser, and would falsely pretend to her husband, that he had\nattempted her chastity; and that Potiphar would hearken to her words rather\nthan to his, let his be ever so agreeable to the truth.", "When the woman had said thus, and even with tears in her eyes, neither\ndid pity dissuade Joseph from his chastity, nor did fear compel him to\na compliance with her; but he opposed her solicitations, and did not yield\nto her threatenings, and was afraid to do an ill thing, and chose to undergo\nthe sharpest punishment rather than to enjoy his present advantages, by\ndoing what his own conscience knew would justly deserve that he should\ndie for it. He also put her in mind that she was a married woman, and that\nshe ought to cohabit with her husband only; and desired her to suffer these\nconsiderations to have more weight with her than the short pleasure of\nlustful dalliance, which would bring her to repentance afterwards, would\ncause trouble to her, and yet would not amend what had been done amiss.\nHe also suggested to her the fear she would be in lest they should be caught;\nand that the advantage of concealment was uncertain, and that only while\nthe wickedness was not known [would there be any quiet for them]; but that\nshe might have the enjoyment of her husband's company without any danger.\nAnd he told her, that in the company of her husband she might have great\nboldness from a good conscience, both before God and before men. Nay, that\nshe would act better like his mistress, and make use of her authority over\nhim better while she persisted in her chastity, than when they were both\nashamed for what wickedness they had been guilty of; and that it is much\nbetter to a life, well and known to have been so, than upon the hopes of\nthe concealment of evil practices.", "Joseph, by saying this, and more, tried to restrain the violent passion\nof the woman, and to reduce her affections within the rules of reason;\nbut she grew more ungovernable and earnest in the matter; and since she\ndespaired of persuading him, she laid her hands upon him, and had a mind\nto force him. But as soon as Joseph had got away from her anger, leaving\nalso his garment with her, for he left that to her, and leaped out of her\nchamber, she was greatly afraid lest he should discover her lewdness to\nher husband, and greatly troubled at the affront he had offered her; so\nshe resolved to be beforehand with him, and to accuse Joseph falsely to\nPotiphar, and by that means to revenge herself on him for his pride and\ncontempt of her; and she thought it a wise thing in itself, and also becoming\na woman, thus to prevent his accusation. Accordingly she sat sorrowful\nand in confusion, framing herself so hypocritically and angrily, that the\nsorrow, which was really for her being disappointed of her lust, might\nappear to be for the attempt upon her chastity; so that when her husband\ncame home, and was disturbed at the sight of her and inquired what was\nthe cause of the disorder she was in, she began to accuse Joseph: and,\n\"O husband,\" said she, \"mayst thou not live a day longer\nif thou dost not punish the wicked slave who has desired to defile thy\nbed; who has neither minded who he was when he came to our house, so as\nto behave himself with modesty; nor has he been mindful of what favors\nhe had received from thy bounty (as he must be an ungrateful man indeed,\nunless he, in every respect, carry himself in a manner agreeable to us):\nthis man, I say, laid a private design to abuse thy wife, and this at the\ntime of a festival, observing when thou wouldst be absent. So that it now\nis clear that his modesty, as it appeared to be formerly, was only because\nof the restraint he was in out of fear of thee, but that he was not really\nof a good disposition. This has been occasioned by his being advanced to\nhonor beyond what he deserved, and what he hoped for; insomuch that he\nconcluded, that he who was deemed fit to be trusted with thy estate and\nthe government of thy family, and was preferred above thy eldest servants,\nmight be allowed to touch thy wife also.\" Thus when she had ended\nher discourse, she showed him his garment, as if he then left it with her\nwhen he attempted to force her. But Potiphar not being able to disbelieve\nwhat his wife's tears showed, and what his wife said, and what he saw himself,\nand being seduced by his love to his wife, did not set himself about the\nexamination of the truth; but taking it for granted that his wife was a\nmodest woman, and condemning Joseph as a wicked man, he threw him into\nthe malefactors' prison; and had a still higher opinion of his wife, and\nbare her witness that she was a woman of a becoming modesty and chastity.", "NOW Joseph, commending all his affairs to God, did not betake himself\nto make his defense, nor to give an account of the exact circumstances\nof the fact, but silently underwent the bonds and the distress he was in,\nfirmly believing that God, who knew the cause of his affliction, and the\ntruth of the fact, would be more powerful than those that inflicted the\npunishments upon him : - a proof of whose providence he quickly received;\nfor the keeper of the prison taking notice of his care and fidelity in\nthe affairs he had set him about, and the dignity of his countenance, relaxed\nhis bonds, and thereby made his heavy calamity lighter, and more supportable\nto him. He also permitted him to make use of a diet better than that of\nthe rest of the prisoners. Now, as his fellow prisoners, when their hard\nlabors were over, fell to discoursing one among another, as is usual in\nsuch as are equal sufferers, and to inquire one of another what were the\noccasions of their being condemned to a prison: among them the king's cupbearer,\nand one that had been respected by him, was put in bonds, upon the king's\nanger at him. This man was under the same bonds with Joseph, and grew more\nfamiliar with him; and upon his observing that Joseph had a better understanding\nthan the rest had, he told him of a dream he had, and desired he would\ninterpret its meaning, complaining that, besides the afflictions he underwent\nfrom the king, God did also add to him trouble from his dreams.", "He therefore said, that in his sleep he saw three clusters of grapes\nhanging upon three branches of a vine, large already, and ripe for gathering;\nand that he squeezed them into a cup which the king held in his hand; and\nwhen he had strained the wine, he gave it to the king to drink, and that\nhe received it from him with a pleasant countenance. This, he said, was\nwhat he saw; and he desired Joseph, that if he had any portion of understanding\nin such matters, he would tell him what this vision foretold. Who bid him\nbe of good cheer, and expect to be loosed from his bonds in three days'\ntime, because the king desired his service, and was about to restore him\nto it again; for he let him know that God bestows the fruit of the vine\nupon men for good; which wine is poured out to him, and is the pledge of\nfidelity and mutual confidence among men; and puts an end to their quarrels,\ntakes away passion and grief out of the minds of them that use it, and\nmakes them cheerful. \"Thou sayest that thou didst squeeze this wine\nfrom three clusters of grapes with thine hands, and that the king received\nit: know, therefore, that this vision is for thy good, and foretells a\nrelease from thy present distress within the same number of days as the\nbranches had whence thou gatheredst thy grapes in thy sleep. However, remember\nwhat prosperity I have foretold thee when thou hast found it true by experience;\nand when thou art in authority, do not overlook us in this prison, wherein\nthou wilt leave us when thou art gone to the place we have foretold; for\nwe are not in prison for any crime; but for the sake of our virtue and\nsobriety are we condemned to suffer the penalty of malefactors, and because\nwe are not willing to injure him that has thus distressed us, though it\nwere for our own pleasure.\" The cupbearer, therefore, as was natural\nto do, rejoiced to hear such an interpretation of his dream, and waited\nthe completion of what had been thus shown him beforehand.", "But another servant there was of the king, who had been chief baker,\nand was now bound in prison with the cupbearer; he also was in good hope,\nupon Joseph's interpretation of the other's vision, for he had seen a dream\nalso; so he desired that Joseph would tell him what the visions he had\nseen the night before might mean. They were these that follow: - \"Methought,\"\nsays he, \"I carried three baskets upon my head; two were full of loaves,\nand the third full of sweetmeats and other eatables, such as are prepared\nfor kings; but that the fowls came flying, and eat them all up, and had\nno regard to my attempt to drive them away.\" And he expected a prediction\nlike to that of the cupbearer. But Joseph, considering and reasoning about\nthe dream, said to him, that he would willingly be an interpreter of good\nevents to him, and not of such as his dream denounced to him; but he told\nhim that he had only three days in all to live, for that the [three] baskets\nsignify, that on the third day he should be crucified, and devoured by\nfowls, while he was not able to help himself. Now both these dreams had\nthe same several events that Joseph foretold they should have, and this\nto both the parties; for on the third day before mentioned, when the king\nsolemnized his birth-day, he crucified the chief baker, but set the butler\nfree from his bonds, and restored him to his former ministration.", "But God freed Joseph from his confinement, after he had endured his\nbonds two years, and had received no assistance from the cupbearer, who\ndid not remember what he had said to him formerly; and God contrived this\nmethod of deliverance for him. Pharaoh the king had seen in his sleep the\nsame evening two visions; and after them had the interpretations of them\nboth given him. He had forgotten the latter, but retained the dreams themselves.\nBeing therefore troubled at what he had seen, for it seemed to him to be\nall of a melancholy nature, the next day he called together the wisest\nmen among the Egyptians, desiring to learn from them the interpretation\nof his dreams. But when they hesitated about them, the king was so much\nthe more disturbed. And now it was that the memory of Joseph, and his skill\nin dreams, came into the mind of the king's cupbearer, when he saw the\nconfusion that Pharaoh was in; so he came and mentioned Joseph to him,\nas also the vision he had seen in prison, and how the event proved as he\nhad said; as also that the chief baker was crucified on the very same day;\nand that this also happened to him according to the interpretation of Joseph.\nThat Joseph himself was laid in bonds by Potiphar, who was his head cook,\nas a slave; but, he said, he was one of the noblest of the stock of the\nHebrews; and said further, his father lived in great splendor. \"If,\ntherefore, thou wilt send for him, and not despise him on the score of\nhis misfortunes, thou wilt learn what thy dreams signify.\" So the\nking commanded that they should bring Joseph into his presence; and those\nwho received the command came and brought him with them, having taken care\nof his habit, that it might be decent, as the king had enjoined them to\ndo.", "But the king took him by the hand; and, \"O young man,\"\nsays he, \"for my servant bears witness that thou art at present\nthe best and most skillful person I can consult with; vouchsafe me the\nsame favors which thou bestowedst on this servant of mine, and tell me\nwhat events they are which the visions of my dreams foreshow; and I desire\nthee to suppress nothing out of fear, nor to flatter me with lying words,\nor with what may please me, although the truth should be of a melancholy\nnature. For it seemed to me that, as I walked by the river, I saw kine\nfat and very large, seven in number, going from the river to the marshes;\nand other kine of the same number like them, met them out of the marshes,\nexceeding lean and ill-favored, which ate up the fat and the large kine,\nand yet were no better than before, and not less miserably pinched with\nfamine. After I had seen this vision, I awaked out of my sleep; and being\nin disorder, and considering with myself what this appearance should be,\nI fell asleep again, and saw another dream, much more wonderful than the\nforegoing, which still did more affright and disturb me: - I saw seven\nears of corn growing out of one root, having their heads borne down by\nthe weight of the grains, and bending down with the fruit, which was now\nripe and fit for reaping; and near these I saw seven other ears of corn,\nmeager and weak, for want of rain, which fell to eating and consuming those\nthat were fit for reaping, and put me into great astonishment.\"", {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7016833", "#text": "Egypt"}, "#text": "To which Joseph replied: - \"This dream,\" said he, \"O\nking, although seen under two forms, signifies one and the same event of\nthings; for when thou sawest the fat kine, which is an animal made for\nthe plough and for labor, devoured by the worser kine, and the ears of\ncorn eaten up by the smaller ears, they foretell a famine, and want of\nthe fruits of the earth for the same number of years, and equal with those\nwhen  was in a happy state; and this so far, that the plenty of these\nyears will be spent in the same number of years of scarcity, and that scarcity\nof necessary provisions will be very difficult to be corrected; as a sign\nwhereof, the ill-favored kine, when they had devoured the better sort,\ncould not be satisfied.

His concern was, that he might receive them back again safe\nafter their journey; and their concern was, that they might find their\nfather well, and no way afflicted with grief for them. And this lamentation\nlasted a whole day; so that the old man was at last tired with grief, and\nstaid behind; but they went on their way for , endeavoring to mitigate\ntheir grief for their present misfortunes, with the hopes of better success\nhereafter."}, {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7016833", "#text": "Egypt"}, "#text": "As soon as they came into , they were brought down to Joseph:\nbut here no small fear disturbed them, lest they should be accused about\nthe price of the corn, as if they had cheated Joseph.

He said he did not know what they meant: so they were delivered\nfrom that fear. And when he had loosed Symeon, and put him into a handsome\nhabit, he suffered him to be with his brethren; at which time Joseph came\nfrom his attendance on the king. So they offered him their presents; and\nupon his putting the question to them about their father, they answered\nthat they found him well. He also, upon his discovery that Benjamin was\nalive, asked whether this was their younger brother; for he had seen him.\nWhereupon they said he was: he replied, that the God over all was his protector.\nBut when his affection to him made him shed tears, he retired, desiring\nhe might not be seen in that plight by his brethren. Then Joseph took them\nto supper, and they were set down in the same order as they used to sit\nat their father's table. And although Joseph treated them all kindly, yet\ndid he send a mess to Benjamin that was double to what the rest of the\nguests had for their shares."}, "Now when after supper they had composed themselves to sleep, Joseph\ncommanded his steward both to give them their measures of corn, and to\nhide its price again in their sacks; and that withal they should put into\nBenjamin's sack the golden cup, out of which he loved himself to drink.\n- which things he did, in order to make trial of his brethren, whether\nthey would stand by Benjamin when he should be accused of having stolen\nthe cup, and should appear to be in danger; or whether they would leave\nhim, and, depending on their own innocency, go to their father without\nhim. When the servant had done as he was bidden, the sons of Jacob, knowing\nnothing of all this, went their way, and took Symeon along with them, and\nhad a double cause of joy, both because they had received him again, and\nbecause they took back Benjamin to their father, as they had promised.\nBut presently a troop of horsemen encompassed them, and brought with them\nJoseph's servant, who had put the cup into Benjamin's sack. Upon which\nunexpected attack of the horsemen they were much disturbed, and asked what\nthe reason was that they came thus upon men, who a little before had been\nby their lord thought worthy of an honorable and hospitable reception?\nThey replied, by calling them wicked wretches, who had forgot that very\nhospitable and kind treatment which Joseph had given them, and did not\nscruple to be injurious to him, and to carry off that cup out of which\nhe had, in so friendly a manner, drank to them, and not regarding their\nfriendship with Joseph, no more than the danger they should be in if they\nwere taken, in comparison of the unjust gain. Hereupon he threatened that\nthey should be punished; for though they had escaped the knowledge of him\nwho was but a servant, yet had they not escaped the knowledge of God, nor\nhad gone off with what they had stolen; and, after all, asked why we come\nupon them, as if they knew nothing of the matter: and he told them that\nthey should immediately know it by their punishment. This, and more of\nthe same nature, did the servant say, in way of reproach to them: but they\nbeing wholly ignorant of any thing here that concerned them, laughed at\nwhat he said, and wondered at the abusive language which the servant gave\nthem, when he was so hardy as to accuse those who did not before so much\nas retain the price of their corn, which was found in their sacks, but\nbrought it again, though nobody else knew of any such thing, - so far were\nthey from offering any injury to Joseph voluntarily. But still, supposing\nthat a search would be a more sure justification of themselves than their\nown denial of the fact, they bid him search them, and that if any of them\nhad been guilty of the theft, to punish them all; for being no way conscious\nto themselves of any crime, they spake with assurance, and, as they thought,\nwithout any danger to themselves also. The servants desired there might\nbe a search made; but they said the punishment should extend to him alone\nwho should be found guilty of the theft. So they made the search; and,\nhaving searched all the rest, they came last of all to Benjamin, as knowing\nit was Benjamin's sack in which they had hidden the cup, they having indeed\nsearched the rest only for a show of accuracy: so the rest were out of\nfear for themselves, and were now only concerned about Benjamin, but still\nwere well assured that he would also be found innocent; and they reproached\nthose that came after them for their hindering them, while they might,\nin the mean while, have gotten a good way on their journey. But as soon\nas they had searched Benjamin's sack, they found the cup, and took it from\nhim; and all was changed into mourning and lamentation. They rent their\ngarments, and wept for the punishment which their brother was to undergo\nfor his theft, and for the delusion they had put on their father, when\nthey promised they would bring Benjamin safe to him. What added to their\nmisery was, that this melancholy accident came unfortunately at\na time when they thought they had been gotten off clear; but they confessed\nthat this misfortune of their brother, as well as the grief of their father\nfor him, was owing to themselves, since it was they that forced their father\nto send him with them, when he was averse to it.", {"emph": "\"", "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This\noration seems to me too large, and too unusual a digression, to have been\ncomposed by Judas on this occasion.

They said\nfurther; that they were the plague of their father, since they should now\nadd to his former affliction for Joseph, this other affliction for Benjamin.\nReubel also was large in cutting them upon this occasion. But Joseph dismissed\nthem; for he said they had been guilty of no offense, and that he would\ncontent himself with the lad's punishment; for he said it was not a fit\nthing to let him go free, for the sake of those who had not offended; nor\nwas it a fit thing to punish them together with him who had been guilty\nof stealing. And when he promised to give them leave to go away in safety,\nthe rest of them were under great consternation, and were able to say nothing\non this sad occasion. But Judas, who had persuaded their father to send\nthe lad from him, being otherwise also a very bold and active man, determined\nto hazard himself for the preservation of his brother. \"It is true,\"\n said\nhe, \"O governor, that we have been very wicked with regard to thee,\nand on that account deserved punishment; even all of us may justly be punished,\nalthough the theft were not committed by all, but only by one of us, and\nhe the youngest also; but yet there remains some hope for us, who otherwise\nmust be under despair on his account, and this from thy goodness, which\npromises us a deliverance out of our present danger. And now I beg thou\nwilt not look at us, or at that great crime we have been guilty of, but\nat thy own excellent nature, and take advice of thine own virtue, instead\nof that wrath thou hast against us; which passion those that otherwise\nare of lower character indulge, as they do their strength, and that not\nonly on great, but also on very trifling occasions. Overcome, sir, that\npassion, and be not subdued by it, nor suffer it to slay those that do\nnot otherwise presume upon their own safety, but are desirous to accept\nof it from thee; for this is not the first time that thou wilt bestow it\non us, but before, when we came to buy corn, thou affordedst us great plenty\nof food, and gavest us leave to carry so much home to our family as has\npreserved them from perishing by famine. Nor is there any difference between\nnot overlooking men that were perishing for want of necessaries, and not\npunishing those that seem to be offenders, and have been so unfortunate\nas to lose the advantage of that glorious benefaction which they received\nfrom thee. This will be an instance of equal favor, though bestowed after\na different manner; for thou wilt save those this way whom thou didst feed\nthe other; and thou wilt hereby preserve alive, by thy own bounty, those\nsouls which thou didst not suffer to be distressed by famine, it being\nindeed at once a wonderful and a great thing to sustain our lives by corn,\nand to bestow on us that pardon, whereby, now we are distressed, we may\ncontinue those lives. And I am ready to suppose that God is willing to\nafford thee this opportunity of showing thy virtuous disposition, by bringing\nus into this calamity, that it may appear thou canst forgive the injuries\nthat are done to thyself, and mayst be esteemed kind to others, besides\nthose who, on other accounts, stand in need of thy assistance; since it\nis indeed a right thing to do well to those who are in distress for want\nof food, but still a more glorious thing to save those who deserve to be\npunished, when it is on account of heinous offenses against thyself; for\nif it be a thing deserving commendation to forgive such as have been guilty\nof small offenses, that tend to a person's loss, and this be praiseworthy\nin him that overlooks such offenses, to restrain a man's passion as to\ncrimes which are capital to the guilty, is to be like the most excellent\nnature of God himself. And truly, as for myself, had it not been that we\nhad a father, who had discovered, on occasion of the death of Joseph, how\nmiserably he is always afflicted at the loss of his sons, I had not made\nany words on account of the saving of our own lives; I mean, any further\nthan as that would be an excellent character for thyself, to preserve even\nthose that would have nobody to lament them when they were dead, but we\nwould have yielded ourselves up to suffer whatsoever thou pleasedst; but\nnow (for we do not plead for mercy to ourselves, though indeed, if we die,\nit will be while we are young, and before we have had the enjoyment of\nlife) have regard to our father, and take pity of his old age, on whose\naccount it is that we make these supplications to thee. We beg thou wilt\ngive us those lives which this wickedness of ours has rendered obnoxious\nto thy punishment; and this for his sake who is not himself wicked, nor\ndoes his being our father make us wicked. He is a good man, and not worthy\nto have such trials of his patience; and now, we are absent, he is afflicted\nwith care for us. But if he hear of our deaths, and what was the cause\nof it, he will on that account die an immature death; and the reproachful\nmanner of our ruin will hasten his end, and will directly kill him; nay,\nwill bring him to a miserable death, while he will make haste to rid himself\nout of the world, and bring himself to a state of insensibility, before\nthe sad story of our end come abroad into the rest of the world. Consider\nthese things in this manner, although our wickedness does now provoke thee\nwith a just desire of punishing that wickedness, and forgive it for our\nfather's sake; and let thy commiseration of him weigh more with thee than\nour wickedness. Have regard to the old age of our father, who, if we perish,\nwill be very lonely while he lives, and will soon die himself also. Grant\nthis boon to the name of fathers, for thereby thou wilt honor him that\nbegat thee, and will grant it to thyself also, who enjoyest already that\ndenomination; thou wilt then, by that denomination, be preserved of God,\nthe Father of all, - by showing a pious regard to which, in the case of\nour father, thou wilt appear to honor him who is styled by the same name;\nI mean, if thou wilt have this pity on our father, upon this consideration,\nhow miserable he will be if he be deprived of his sons! It is thy part\ntherefore to bestow on us what God has given us, when it is in thy power\nto take it away, and so to resemble him entirely in charity; for it is\ngood to use that power, which can either give or take away, on the merciful\nside; and when it is in thy power to destroy, to forget that thou ever\nhadst that power, and to look on thyself as only allowed power for preservation;\nand that the more any one extends this power, the greater reputation does\nhe gain to himself. Now, by forgiving our brother what he has unhappily\ncommitted, thou wilt preserve us all; for we cannot think of living if\nhe be put to death, since we dare not show ourselves alive to our father\nwithout our brother, but here must we partake of one and the same catastrophe\nof his life. And so far we beg of thee, O governor, that if thou condemnest\nour brother to die, thou wilt punish us together with him, as partners\nof his crime, - for we shall not think it reasonable to be reserved to\nkill ourselves for grief of our brother's death, but so to die rather as\nequally guilty with him of this crime. I will only leave with thee this\none consideration, and then will say no more, viz. that our brother committed\nthis fault when he was young, and not yet of confirmed wisdom in his conduct;\nand that men naturally forgive such young persons. I end here, without\nadding what more I have to say, that in case thou condemnest us, that omission\nmay be supposed to have hurt us, and permitted thee to take the severer\nside. But in case thou settest us free, that this may be ascribed to thy\nown goodness, of which thou art inwardly conscious, that thou freest us\nfrom condemnation; and that not by barely preserving us, but by granting\nus such a favor as will make us appear more righteous than we really are,\nand by representing to thyself more motives for our deliverance than we\nare able to produce ourselves. If, therefore, thou resolvest to slay him,\nI desire thou wilt slay me in his stead, and send him back to his father;\nor if thou pleasest to retain him with thee as a slave, I am fitter to\nlabor for thy advantage in that capacity, and, as thou seest, am better\nprepared for either of those sufferings.\" \nSo Judas, being very willing to undergo any thing whatever for the deliverance\nof his brother, cast himself down at Joseph's feet, and earnestly labored\nto assuage and pacify his anger. All his brethren also fell down before\nhim, weeping and delivering themselves up to destruction for the preservation\nof the life of Benjamin."}, "But Joseph, as overcome now with his affections, and no longer able\nto personate an angry man, commanded all that were present to depart, that\nhe might make himself known to his brethren when they were alone; and when\nthe rest were gone out, he made himself known to his brethren; and said,\n\"I commend you for your virtue, and your kindness to our brother:\nI find you better men than I could have expected from what you contrived\nabout me. Indeed, I did all this to try your love to your brother; so I\nbelieve you were not wicked by nature in what you did in my case, but that\nall has happened according to God's will, who has hereby procured our enjoyment\nof what good things we have; and, if he continue in a favorable disposition,\nof what we hope for hereafter. Since, therefore, I know that our father\nis safe and well, beyond expectation, and I see you so well disposed to\nyour brother, I will no longer remember what guilt you seem to have had\nabout me, but will leave off to hate you for that your wickedness; and\ndo rather return you my thanks, that you have concurred with the intentions\nof God to bring things to their present state. I would have you also rather\nto forget the same, since that imprudence of yours is come to such a happy\nconclusion, than to be uneasy and blush at those your offenses. Do not,\ntherefore, let your evil intentions, when you condemned me, and that bitter\nremorse which might follow, be a grief to you now, because those intentions\nwere frustrated. Go, therefore, your way, rejoicing in what has happened\nby the Divine Providence, and inform your father of it, lest he should\nbe spent with cares for you, and deprive me of the most agreeable part\nof my felicity; I mean, lest he should die before he comes into my sight,\nand enjoys the good things that we now have. Bring, therefore, with you\nour father, and your wives and children, and all your kindred, and remove\nyour habitations hither; for it is not proper that the persons dearest\nto me should live remote from me, now my affairs are so prosperous, especially\nwhen they must endure five more years of famine.\" When Joseph had\nsaid this, he embraced his brethren, who were in tears and sorrow; but\nthe generous kindness of their brother seemed to leave among them no room\nfor fear, lest they should be punished on account of what they had consulted\nand acted against him; and they were then feasting.

But Moses prevented the enemies,\nand took and led his army before those enemies were apprized of his attacking\nthem; for he did not march by the river, but by land, where he gave a wonderful\ndemonstration of his sagacity; for when the ground was difficult to be\npassed over, because of the multitude of serpents, (which it produces in\nvast numbers, and, indeed, is singular in some of those productions, which\nother countries do not breed, and yet such as are worse than others in\npower and mischief, and an unusual fierceness of sight, some of which ascend\nout of the ground unseen, and also fly in the air, and so come upon men\nat unawares, and do them a mischief,) Moses invented a wonderful stratagem\nto preserve the army safe, and without hurt; for he made baskets, like\nunto arks, of sedge, and filled them with ibes, \nand carried them along with them; which animal is the greatest enemy to\nserpents imaginable, for they fly from them when they come near them; and\nas they fly they are caught and devoured by them, as if it were done by\nthe harts; but the ibes are tame creatures, and only enemies to the serpentine\nkind: but about these ibes I say no more at present, since the Greeks themselves\nare not unacquainted with this sort of bird.

He therefore betook himself to prayer to God, that he would\nchange the water from its present badness, and make it fit for drinking.\nAnd when God had granted him that favor, he took the top of a stick that\nlay down at his feet, and divided it in the middle, and made the section\nlengthways. He then let it down into the well, and persuaded the Hebrews\nthat God had hearkened to his prayers, and had promised to render the water\nsuch as they desired it to be, in case they would be subservient to him\nin what he should enjoin them to do, and this not after a remiss or negligent\nmanner. And when they asked what they were to do in order to have the water\nchanged for the better, he bid the strongest men among them that stood\nthere, to draw up water \nand told them, that when the greatest part was drawn up, the remainder\nwould be fit to drink. So they labored at it till the water was so agitated\nand purged as to be fit to drink."}, "And now removing from thence they came to Elim; which place looked\nwell at a distance, for there was a grove of palm-trees; but when they\ncame near to it, it appeared to be a bad place, for the palm-trees were\nno more than seventy; and they were ill-grown and creeping trees, by the\nwant of water, for the country about was all parched, and no moisture sufficient\nto water them, and make them hopeful and useful, was derived to them from\nthe fountains, which were in number twelve: they were rather a few moist\nplaces than springs, which not breaking out of the ground, nor running\nover, could not sufficiently water the trees. And when they dug into the\nsand, they met with no water; and if they took a few drops of it into their\nhands, they found it to be useless, on account of its mud. The trees were\ntoo weak to bear fruit, for want of being sufficiently cherished and enlivened\nby the water. So they laid the blame on their conductor, and made heavy\ncomplaints against him; and said that this their miserable state, and the\nexperience they had of adversity, were owing to him; for that they had\nthen journeyed an entire thirty days, and had spent all the provisions\nthey had brought with them; and meeting with no relief, they were in a\nvery desponding condition. And by fixing their attention upon nothing but\ntheir present misfortunes, they were hindered from remembering what deliverances\nthey had received from God, and those by the virtue and wisdom of Moses\nalso; so they were very angry at their conductor, and were zealous in their\nattempt to stone him, as the direct occasion of their present miseries.", "But as for Moses himself, while the multitude were irritated and\nbitterly set against him, he cheerfully relied upon God, and upon his consciousness\nof the care he had taken of these his own people; and he came into the\nmidst of them, even while they clamored against him, and had stones in\ntheir hands in order to despatch him. Now he was of an agreeable presence,\nand very able to persuade the people by his speeches; accordingly he began\nto mitigate their anger, and exhorted them not to be over-mindful of their\npresent adversities, lest they should thereby suffer the benefits that\nhad formerly been bestowed on them to slip out of their memories; and he\ndesired them by no means, on account of their present uneasiness, to cast\nthose great and wonderful favors and gifts, which they had obtained of\nGod, out of their minds, but to expect deliverance out of those their present\ntroubles which they could not free themselves from, and this by the means\nof that Divine Providence which watched over them.

He told them,\nit appeared they were not really good men, either in patience, or in remembering\nwhat had been successfully done for them, sometimes by contemning God and\nhis commands, when by those commands they left the land of Egypt; and sometimes\nby behaving themselves ill towards him who was the servant of God, and\nthis when he had never deceived them, either in what he said, or had ordered\nthem to do by God's command. He also put them in mind of all that had passed;\nhow the Egyptians were destroyed when they attempted to detain them, contrary\nto the command of God; and after what manner the very same river was to\nthe others bloody, and not fit for drinking, but was to them sweet, and\nfit for drinking; and how they went a new road through the sea, which fled\na long way from them, by which very means they were themselves preserved,\nbut saw their enemies destroyed; and that when they were in want of weapons,\nGod gave them plenty of them; - and so he recounted all the particular\ninstances, how when they were, in appearance, just going to be destroyed,\nGod had saved them in a surprising manner; and that he had still the same\npower; and that they ought not even now to despair of his providence over\nthem; and accordingly he exhorted them to continue quiet, and to consider\nthat help would not come too late, though it come not immediately, if it\nbe present with them before they suffer any great misfortune; that they\nought to reason thus: that God delays to assist them, not because he has\nno regard to them, but because he will first try their fortitude, and the\npleasure they take in their freedom, that he may learn whether you have\nsouls great enough to bear want of food, and scarcity of water, on its\naccount; or whether you rather love to be slaves, as cattle are slaves\nto such as own them, and feed them liberally, but only in order to make\nthem more useful in their service. That as for himself, he shall not be\nso much concerned for his own preservation; for if he die unjustly, he\nshall not reckon it any affliction, but that he is concerned for them,\nlest, by casting stones at him, they should be thought to condemn God himself.", "By this means Moses pacified the people, and restrained them from\nstoning him, and brought them to repent of what they were going to do.\nAnd because he thought the necessity they were under made their passion\nless unjustifiable, he thought he ought to apply himself to God by prayer\nand supplication; and going up to an eminence, he requested of God for\nsome succor for the people, and some way of deliverance from the want they\nwere in, because in him, and in him alone, was their hope of salvation;\nand he desired that he would forgive what necessity had forced the people\nto do, since such was the nature of mankind, hard to please, and very complaining\nunder adversities. Accordingly God promised he would take care of them,\nand afford them the succor they were desirous of. Now when Moses had heard\nthis from God, he came down to the multitude. But as soon as they saw him\njoyful at the promises he had received from God, they changed their sad\ncountenances into gladness.

Then therefore it was that Moses began\nto encourage them, and to exhort them to have a good heart, and rely on\nGod's assistance by which they had been state of freedom and to hope for\nvictory over those who were ready to fight with them, in order to deprive\nthem of that blessing: that they were to suppose their own army to be numerous,\nwanting nothing, neither weapons, nor money, nor provisions, nor such other\nconveniences as, when men are in possession of, they fight undauntedly;\nand that they are to judge themselves to have all these advantages in the\nDivine assistance.

The young men he charged to obey their elders,\nand the elders to hearken to their leader. So the people were elevated\nin their minds, and ready to try their fortune in battle, and hoped to\nbe thereby at length delivered from all their miseries: nay, they desired\nthat Moses would immediately lead them against their enemies without the\nleast delay, that no backwardness might be a hindrance to their present\nresolution. So Moses sorted all that were fit for war into different troops,\nand set Joshua, the son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, over them; one\nthat was of great courage, and patient to undergo labors; of great abilities\nto understand, and to speak what was proper; and very serious in the worship\nof God; and indeed made like another Moses, a teacher of piety towards\nGod. He also appointed a small party of the armed men to be near the water,\nand to take care of the children, and the women, and of the entire camp.\nSo that whole night they prepared themselves for the battle; they took\ntheir weapons, if any of them had such as were well made, and attended\nto their commanders as ready to rush forth to the battle as soon as Moses\nshould give the word of command. Moses also kept awake, teaching Joshua\nafter what manner he should order his camp. But when the day began, Moses\ncalled for Joshua again, and exhorted him to approve himself in deeds such\na one as a his reputation made men expect from him; and to gain glory by\nthe present expedition, in the opinion of those under him, for his exploits\nin this battle. He also gave a particular exhortation to the principal\nmen of the Hebrews, and encouraged the whole army as it stood armed before\nhim.

The forementioned battle,\nwhen they had once got it, was also the occasion of their prosperity, not\nonly for the present, but for the future ages also; for they not only made\nslaves of the bodies of their enemies, but subdued their minds also, and\nafter this battle, became terrible to all that dwelt round about them.\nMoreover, they acquired a vast quantity of riches; for a great deal of\nsilver and gold was left in the enemy's camp; as also brazen vessels, which\nthey made common use of in their families; many utensils also that were\nembroidered there were of both sorts, that is, of what were weaved,\nand what were the ornaments of their armor, and other things that served\nfor use in the family, and for the furniture of their rooms; they got also\nthe prey of their cattle, and of whatsoever uses to follow camps, when\nthey remove from one place to another.

Nor was any one of the Hebrews slain;\nbut the slain of the enemy's army were too many to be enumerated. So Moses\noffered sacrifices of thanksgiving to God, and built an altar, which he\nnamed .

Now when these things were brought together with\ngreat diligence, (for every one was ambitious to further the work even\nbeyond their ability,) he set architects over the works, and this by the\ncommand of God; and indeed the very same which the people themselves would\nhave chosen, had the election been allowed to them.

Their chapiters were of silver, but their bases\nwere of brass: they resembled the sharp ends of spears, and were of brass,\nfixed into the ground. Cords were also put through the rings, and were\ntied at their farther ends to brass nails of a cubit long, which, at every\npillar, were driven into the floor, and would keep the tabernacle from\nbeing shaken by the violence of winds; but a curtain of fine soft linen\nwent round all the pillars, and hung down in a flowing and loose manner\nfrom their chapiters, and enclosed the whole space, and seemed not at all\nunlike to a wall about it. And this was the structure of three of the sides\nof this enclosure; but as for the fourth side, which was fifty cubits in\nextent, and was the front of the whole, twenty cubits of it were for the\nopening of the gates, wherein stood two pillars on each side, after the\nresemblance of open gates. These were made wholly of silver, and polished,\nand that all over, excepting the bases, which were of brass. Now on each\nside of the gates there stood three pillars, which were inserted into the\nconcave bases of the gates, and were suited to them; and round them was\ndrawn a curtain of fine linen; but to the gates themselves, which were\ntwenty cubits in extent, and five in height, the curtain was composed of\npurple, and scarlet, and blue, and fine linen, and embroidered with many\nand divers sorts of figures, excepting the figures of animals. Within these\ngates was the brazen laver for purification, having a basin beneath of\nthe like matter, whence the priests might wash their hands and sprinkle\ntheir feet; and this was the ornamental construction of the enclosure about\nthe court of the tabernacle, which was exposed to the open air."}, "As to the tabernacle itself, Moses placed it in the middle of that\ncourt, with its front to the east, that, when the sun arose, it might send\nits first rays upon it. Its length, when it was set up, was thirty cubits,\nand its breadth was twelve [ten] cubits. The one of its walls was on the\nsouth, and the other was exposed to the north, and on the back part of\nit remained the west. It was necessary that its height should be equal\nto its breadth [ten cubits]. There were also pillars made of wood, twenty\non each side; they were wrought into a quadrangular figure, in breadth\na cubit and a half, but the thickness was four fingers: they had thin plates\nof gold affixed to them on both sides, inwardly and outwardly: they had\neach of them two tenons belonging to them, inserted into their bases, and\nthese were of silver, in each of which bases there was a socket to receive\nthe tenon; but the pillars on the west wall were six. Now all these tenons\nand sockets accurately fitted one another, insomuch that the joints were\ninvisible, and both seemed to be one entire and united wall. It was also\ncovered with gold, both within and without. The number of pillars was equal\non the opposite sides, and there were on each part twenty, and every one\nof them had the third part of a span in thickness; so that the number of\nthirty cubits were fully made up between them; but as to the wall behind,\nwhere the six pillars made up together only nine cubits, they made two\nother pillars, and cut them out of one cubit, which they placed in the\ncorners, and made them equally fine with the other. Now every one of the\npillars had rings of gold affixed to their fronts outward, as if they had\ntaken root in the pillars, and stood one row over against another round\nabout, through which were inserted bars gilt over with gold, each of them\nfive cubits long, and these bound together the pillars, the head of one\nbar running into another, after the nature of one tenon inserted into another;\nbut for the wall behind, there was but one row of bars that went through\nall the pillars, into which row ran the ends of the bars on each side of\nthe longer walls; the male with its female being so fastened in their joints,\nthat they held the whole firmly together; and for this reason was all this\njoined so fast together, that the tabernacle might not be shaken, either\nby the winds, or by any other means, but that it might preserve itself\nquiet and immovable continually.", {"emph": ["The\nHoly Place", "The Holy of Holies"], "#text": "As for the inside, Moses parted its length into three partitions.\nAt the distance of ten cubits from the most secret end, Moses placed four\npillars, the workmanship of which was the very same with that of the rest;\nand they stood upon the like bases with them, each a small matter distant\nfrom his fellow. Now the room within those pillars was the most holy place;\nbut the rest of the room was the tabernacle, which was open for the priests.\nHowever, this proportion of the measures of the tabernacle proved to be\nan imitation of the system of the world; for that third part thereof which\nwas within the four pillars, to which the priests were not admitted, is,\nas it were, a heaven peculiar to God. But the space of the twenty cubits,\nis, as it were, sea and land, on which men live, and so this part is peculiar\nto the priests only. But at the front, where the entrance was made, they\nplaced pillars of gold, that stood on bases of brass, in number seven;\nbut then they spread over the tabernacle veils of fine linen and purple,\nand blue, and scarlet colors, embroidered. The first veil was ten cubits\nevery way, and this they spread over the pillars which parted the temple,\nand kept the most holy place concealed within; and this veil was that which\nmade this part not visible to any. Now the whole temple was called : but that part which was within the four pillars, and to\nwhich none were admitted, was called . This veil\nwas very ornamental, and embroidered with all sorts of flowers which the\nearth produces; and there were interwoven into it all sorts of variety\nthat might be an ornament, excepting the forms of animals. Another veil\nthere was which covered the five pillars that were at the entrance. It\nwas like the former in its magnitude, and texture, and color; and at the\ncorner of every pillar a ring retained it from the top downwards half the\ndepth of the pillars, the other half affording an entrance for the priests,\nwho crept under it. Over this there was a veil of linen, of the same largeness\nwith the former: it was to be drawn this way or that way by cords, the\nrings of which, fixed to the texture of the veil, and to the cords also,\nwere subservient to the drawing and undrawing of the veil, and to the fastening\nit at the corner, that then it might be no hinderance to the view of the\nsanctuary, especially on solemn days; but that on other days, and especially\nwhen the weather was inclined to snow, it might be expanded, and afford\na covering to the veil of divers colors. Whence that custom of ours is\nderived, of having a fine linen veil, after the temple has been built,\nto be drawn over the entrances. But the ten other curtains were four cubits\nin breadth, and twenty-eight in length; and had golden clasps, in order\nto join the one curtain to the other, which was done so exactly that they\nseemed to be one entire curtain. These were spread over the temple, and\ncovered all the top and parts of the walls, on the sides and behind, so\nfar as within one cubit of the ground. There were other curtains of the\nsame breadth with these, but one more in number, and longer, for they were\nthirty cubits long; but these were woven of hair, with the like subtilty\nas those of wool were made, and were extended loosely down to the ground,\nappearing like a triangular front and elevation at the gates, the eleventh\ncurtain being used for this very purpose. There were also other curtains\nmade of skins above these, which afforded covering and protection to those\nthat were woven both in hot weather and when it rained. And great was the\nsurprise of those who viewed these curtains at a distance, for they seemed\nnot at all to differ from the color of the sky. But those that were made\nof hair and of skins, reached down in the same manner as did the veil at\nthe gates, and kept off the heat of the sun, and what injury the rains\nmight do.

At the return of the two\ntribes, without the return of the kingly government, the restoration of\nthis oracle was expected, Nehemiah 7;63; 1 Esd. 5:40; 1 Macc. 4:46; 14:41.\nAnd indeed it may seem to have been restored for some time after the Babylonish\ncaptivity, at least in the days of that excellent high priest, John Hyrcanus,\nwhom Josephus esteemed as a king, a priest, and a prophet; and who, he\nsays, foretold several things that came to pass accordingly; but about\nthe time of his death, he here implies, that this oracle quite ceased,\nand not before. The following high priests now putting diadems on their\nheads, and ruling according to their own will, and by their own authority,\nlike the other kings of the pagan countries about them; so that while the\nGod of Israel was allowed to be the supreme King of Israel, and his directions\nto be their authentic guides, God gave them such directions as their supreme\nKing and Governor, and they were properly under a theocracy, by this oracle\nof Urim, but no longer (see Dr. Bernard's notes here); though I confess\nI cannot but esteem the high priest Jaddus's divine dream, Antiq. B. XI.\nch. 8. sect. 4, and the high priest Caiaphas's most remarkable prophecy,\nJohn 11:47-52, as two small remains or specimens of this ancient oracle,\nwhich properly belonged to the Jewish high priests: nor perhaps ought we\nentirely to forget that eminent prophetic dream of our Josephus himself,\n(one next to a high priest, as of the family of the Asamoneans or Maccabees,)\nas to the succession of Vespasian and Titus to the Roman empire, and that\nin the days of Nero, and before either Galba, Otho, or Vitellius were thought\nof to succeed him. Of the War, B. III. ch. 8. sect. 9. This, I think, may\nwell be looked on as the very last instance of any thing like the prophetic\nUrim among the Jewish nation, and just preceded their fatal desolation:\nbut how it could possibly come to pass that such great men as Sir John\nMarsham and Dr. Spenser, should imagine that this oracle of Urim and Thummim\nwith other practices as old or older than the law of Moses, should have\nbeen ordained in imitation of somewhat like them among the Egyptians, which\nwe never hear of till the days of Diodorus Siculus, Aelian, and Maimonides,\nor little earlier than the Christian era at the highest, is almost unaccountable;\nwhile the main business of the law of Moses was evidently to preserve the\nIsraelites from the idolatrous and superstitious practices of the neighboring\npagan nations; and while it is so undeniable, that the evidence for the\ngreat antiquity of Moses's law is incomparably beyond that for the like\nor greater antiquity of such customs in Egypt or other nations, which indeed\nis generally none at all, it is most absurd to derive any of Moses's laws\nfrom the imitation of those heathen practices, Such hypotheses demonstrate\nto us how far inclination can prevail over evidence, in even some of the\nmost learned part of mankind."}], "emph": "the Oracle", "#text": "I will now treat of what I before omitted, the garment of the high\npriest: for he [Moses] left no room for the evil practices of [false] prophets;\nbut if some of that sort should attempt to abuse the Divine authority,\nhe left it to God to be present at his sacrifices when he pleased, and\nwhen he pleased to be absent. \nAnd he was willing this should be known, not to the Hebrews only, but to\nthose foreigners also who were there. For as to those stones, \nwhich we told you before, the high priest bare on his shoulders, which\nwere sardonyxes, (and I think it needless to describe their nature, they\nbeing known to every body,) the one of them shined out when God was present\nat their sacrifices; I mean that which was in the nature of a button on\nhis right shoulder, bright rays darting out thence, and being seen even\nby those that were most remote; which splendor yet was not before natural\nto the stone. This has appeared a wonderful thing to such as have not so\nfar indulged themselves in philosophy, as to despise Divine revelation.\nYet will I mention what is still more wonderful than this: for God declared\nbeforehand, by those twelve stones which the high priest bare on his breast,\nand which were inserted into his breastplate, when they should be victorious\nin battle; for so great a splendor shone forth from them before the army\nbegan to march, that all the people were sensible of God's being present\nfor their assistance. Whence it came to pass that those Greeks, who had\na veneration for our laws, because they could not possibly contradict this,\ncalled that breastplate . Now this breastplate, and this\nsardonyx, left off shining two hundred years before I composed this book,\nGod having been displeased at the transgressions of his laws.

They offered also gifts to God some as common\nto the whole nation, and others as peculiar to themselves, and these tribe\nby tribe; for the heads of the tribes combined together, two by two, and\nbrought a waggon and a yoke of oxen. These amounted to six, and they carried\nthe tabernacle when they journeyed. Besides which, each head of a tribe\nbrought a bowl, and a charger, and a spoon, of ten darics, full of incense.\nNow the charger and the bowl were of silver, and together they weighed\ntwo hundred shekels, but the bowl cost no more than seventy shekels; and\nthese were full of fine flour mingled with oil, such as they used on the\naltar about the sacrifices.

In the one\ncase, what is slain is burnt, as a whole burnt-offering, whence that name\nis given to it; but the other is a thank-offering, and is designed for\nfeasting those that sacrifice. I will speak of the former. Suppose a private\nman offer a burnt-offering, he must slay either a bull, a lamb, or a kid\nof the goats, and the two latter of the first year, though of bulls he\nis permitted to sacrifice those of a greater age; but all burnt-offerings\nare to be of males.

This is the way of offering a burnt-offering.", "But those that offer thank-offerings do indeed sacrifice the same\ncreatures, but such as are unblemished, and above a year old; however,\nthey may take either males or females.

Two of these being\nmade, one of them was sounded when they required the multitude to come\ntogether to congregations.

Yet while they spake many\nand sore things against the there was one of them who exhorted them to\nbe unmindful of Moses, and of what great pains he had been at about their\ncommon safety; not to despair of assistance from God.

Let us therefore prepare ourselves for the work, for the Canaanites\nwill not resign up their land to us without fighting, but it must be wrested\nfrom them by great struggles in war. Let us then send spies, who may take\na view of the goodness of the land, and what strength it is of; but, above\nall things, let us be of one mind, and let us honor God, who above all\nis our helper and assister.\""}, "When Moses had said thus, the multitude requited him with marks of\nrespect; and chose twelve spies, of the most eminent men, one out of each\ntribe, who, passing over all the land of Canaan, from the borders of Egypt,\ncame to the city Hamath, and to Mount Lebanon; and having learned the nature\nof the land, and of its inhabitants, they came home, having spent forty\ndays in the whole work. They also brought with them of the fruits which\nthe land bare; they also showed them the excellency of those fruits, and\ngave an account of the great quantity of the good things that land afforded,\nwhich were motives to the multitude to go to war. But then they terrified\nthem again with the great difficulty there was in obtaining it; that the\nrivers were so large and deep that they could not be passed over; and that\nthe hills were so high that they could not travel along for them; that\nthe cities were strong with walls, and their firm fortifications round\nabout them. They told them also, that they found at Hebron the posterity\nof the giants. Accordingly these spies, who had seen the land of Canaan,\nwhen they perceived that all these difficulties were greater there than\nthey had met with since they came out of Egypt, they were aftrighted at\nthem themselves, and endeavored to affright the multitude also.", "So they supposed, from what they had heard, that it was impossible\nto get the possession of the country. And when the congregation was dissolved,\nthey, their wives and children, continued their lamentation, as if God\nwould not indeed assist them, but only promised them fair. They also again\nblamed Moses, and made a clamor against him and his brother Aaron, the\nhigh priest. Accordingly they passed that night very ill, and with contumelious\nlanguage against them; but in the morning they ran to a congregation, intending\nto stone Moses and Aaron, and so to return back into Egypt.", "But of the spies, there were Joshua the son of Nun, of the tribe\nof Ephraim, and Caleb of the tribe of Judah, that were afraid of the consequence,\nand came into the midst of them, and stilled the multitude, and desired\nthem to be of good courage; and neither to condemn God, as having told\nthem lies, nor to hearken to those who had aftrighted them, by telling\nthem what was not true concerning the Canaanites, but to those that encouraged\nthem to hope for good success; and that they should gain possession of\nthe happiness promised them, because neither the. height of mountains,\nnor the depth of rivers, could hinder men of true courage from attempting\nthem, especially while God would take care of them beforehand, and be assistant\nto them. \"Let us then go,\" said they, \"against our enemies,\nand have no suspicion of ill success, trusting in God to conduct us, and\nfollowing those that are to be our leaders.\" Thus did these two exhort\nthem, and endeavor to pacify the rage they were in.

For, he said, that when\nhe was in the tabernacle, and was bewailing with ears that destruction\nwhich was coming upon them God put him in mind what things he had done\nfor them, and what benefits they had received from him, and yet how ungrateful\nthey had been to him that just now they had been induced, through the timorousness\nof the spies, to think that their words were truer than his own promise\nto them; and that on this account, though he would not indeed destroy them\nall, nor utterly exterminate their nation, which he had honored more than\nany other part of mankind, yet he would not permit them to take possession\nof the land of Canaan, nor enjoy its happiness; but would make them wander\nin the wilderness, and live without a fixed habitation, and without a city,\nfor forty years together, as a punishment for this their transgression;\nbut that he had promised to give that land to our children, and that he\nwould make them the possessors of those good things which, by your ungoverned\npassions, you have deprived yourselves of.", "When Moses had discoursed thus to them according to the direction\nof God, the multitude, grieved, and were in affliction; and entreated Most\nto procure their reconciliation to God, and to permit them no longer\nto wander in the wilderness, but bestow cities upon them. But he replied,\nthat God would not admit of any such trial, for that God was not moved\nto this determination from any human levity or anger, but that he had judicially\ncondemned them to that punishment. Now we are not to disbelieve that Moses,\nwho was but a single person, pacified so many ten thousands when they werre\nin anger, and converted them to a mildness temper; for God was with him,\nand prepared way to his persuasions of the multitude; and as they had often\nbeen disobedient, they were now sensible that such disobedience was disadvantageous\nto them and that they had still thereby fallen into calamities.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "See Antiq, B.

Thus this legislation, which appeared\nto be divine, made this man to be esteemed as one superior to his own nature.\nNay, further, a little before the beginning of this war, when Claudius\nwas emperor of the Romans, and Ismael was our high priest, and when so\ngreat a famine \nwas come upon us, that one tenth deal [of wheat] was sold for four drachmae,\nand when no less than seventy cori of flour were brought into the temple,\nat the feast of unleavened bread, (these cori are thirty-one Sicilian,\nbut forty-one Athenian medimni,) not one of the priests was so hardy as\nto eat one crumb of it, even while so great a distress was upon the land;\nand this out of a dread of the law, and of that wrath which God retains\nagainst acts of wickedness, even when no one can accuse the actors. Whence\nwe are not to wonder at what was then done, while to this very day the\nwritings left by Moses have so great a force, that even those that hate\nus do confess, that he who established this

with the Canaanites, yet could they not be\npersuaded to be obedient to the words of Moses, and to be quiet; but supposing\nthey should be able to beat their enemies, without his approbation, they\naccused him, and suspected that he made it his business to keep in a distressed\ncondition, that they might always stand in need of his assistance. Accordingly\nthey resolved to fight with the Canaanites, and said that God gave them\nhis assistance, not out of regard to Moses's intercessions, but because\nhe took care of their entire nation, on account of their forefathers, whose\naffairs he took under his own conduct; as also, that it was on account\nof their own virtue that he had formerly procured them their liberty, and\nwould be assisting to them, now they were willing to take pains for it.\nThey also said that they were possessed of abilities sufficient for the\nconquest of their enemies, although Moses should have a mind to alienate\nGod from them; that, however, it was for their advantage to be their own\nmasters, and not so far to rejoice in their deliverance from the indignities\nthey endured under the Egyptians, as to bear the tyranny of Moses over\nthem, and to suffer themselves to be deluded, and live according to his\npleasure, as though God did only foretell what concerns us out of his kindness\nto him, as if they were not all the posterity of Abraham; that God made\nhim alone the author of all the knowledge we have, and we must still learn\nit from him; that it would be a piece of prudence to oppose his arrogant\npretenses, and to put their confidence in God, and to resolve to take possession\nof that land which he had promised them, and not to give ear to him, who\non this account, and under the pretense of Divine authority, forbade them\nso to do. Considering, therefore, the distressed state they were in at\npresent, and that in those desert places they were still to expect things\nwould be worse with them, they resolved to fight with the Canaanites, as\nsubmitting only to God, their supreme Commander, and not waiting for any\nassistance from their legislator.", "When, therefore, they had come to this resolution, as being best\nfor them, they went against their enemies; but those enemies were not dismayed\neither at the attack itself, or at the great multitude that made it, and\nreceived them with great courage. Many of the Hebrews were slain; and the\nremainder of the army, upon the disorder of their troops, were pursued,\nand fled, after a shameful manner, to their camp. Whereupon this unexpected\nmisfortune made them quite despond; and they hoped for nothing that was\ngood; as gathering from it, that this affliction came from the wrath of\nGod, because they rashly went out to war without his approbation.", "But when Moses saw how deeply they were affected with this defeat,\nand being afraid lest the enemies should grow insolent upon this victory,\nand should be desirous of gaining still greater glory, and should attack\nthem, he resolved that it was proper to withdraw the army into the wilderness\nto a further distance from the Canaanites: so the multitude gave themselves\nup again to his conduct, for they were sensible that, without his care\nfor them, their affairs could not be in a good condition; and he caused\nthe host to remove, and he went further into the wilderness, as intending\nthere to let them rest, and not to permit them to fight the Canaanites\nbefore God should afford them a more favorable opportunity.", "THAT which is usually the case of great armies, and especially upon\nill success, to be hard to be pleased, and governed with difficulty, did\nnow befall the Jews; for they being in number six hundred thousand, and\nby reason of their great multitude not readily subject to their governors,\neven in prosperity, they at this time were more than usually angry, both\nagainst one another and against their leader, because of the distress they\nwere in, and the calamities they then endured. Such a sedition overtook\nthem, as we have not the like example either among the Greeks or the Barbarians,\nby which they were in danger of being all destroyed, but were notwithstanding\nsaved by Moses, who would not remember that he had been almost stoned to\ndeath by them. Nor did God neglect to prevent their ruin; but, notwithstanding\nthe indignities they had offered their legislator and the laws, and disobedience\nto the commandments which he had sent them by Moses, he delivered them\nfrom those terrible calamities which, without his providential care, had\nbeen brought upon them by this sedition. So I will first explain the cause\nwhence this sedition arose, and then will give an account of the sedition\nitself; as also of what settlements made for their government after it\nwas over.", "Corah, a Hebrew of principal account, both by his family and by his\nwealth, one that was also able to speak well, and one that could easily\npersuade the people by his speeches, saw that Moses was in an exceeding\ngreat dignity, and was at it, and envied him on that account, (he of the\nsame tribe with Moses, and of kin to him,) was particularly grieved, because\nhe thought he better deserved that honorable post on account of great riches,\nand not inferior to him in his birth. So he raised a clamor against him\namong the Levites, who were of the same tribe, and among his kindred, saying,\n\"That it was a very sad thing that they should overlook Moses, while\nhunted after and paved the way to glory for himself, and by ill arts should\nobtain it, under the pretense of God's command, while, contrary to laws,\nhe had given the priesthood to Aaron, the common suffrage of the multitude,\nbut by his own vote, as bestowing dignities in a way on whom he pleased.\"\nHe added, \"That this concealed way of imposing on them was harder\nto be borne than if it had been done by an open force upon them, because\nhe did now not only their power without their consent, but even they were\nunapprised of his contrivances against them; for whosoever is conscious\nto himself that he deserves any dignity, aims to get it by persuasion,\nand not by an arrogant method of violence; those that believe it impossible\nto obtain honors justly, make a show of goodness, and do not introduce\nforce, but by cunning tricks grow wickedly powerful. That it was proper\nfor the multitude to punish such men, even while they think themselves\nconcealed in their designs, and not suffer them to gain strength till they\nhave them for their open enemies. For what account,\" added he, \"is\nMoses able to give, why he has bestowed the priesthood on Aaron and his\nsons? for if God had determined to bestow that honor on one of the tribe\nof Levi, I am more worthy of it than he is; I myself being equal to Moses\nby my family, and superior to him both in riches and in age: but if God\nhad determined to bestow it on the eldest be, that of Reuben might have\nit most justly; and then Dathan, and Abiram, and [On, the son of] Peleth,\nwould have it; for these are the oldest men of that tribe, and potent on\naccount of their great wealth also.\"", "Now Corah, when he said this, had a mind to appear to take care of\nthe public welfare, but in reality he was endeavoring to procure to have\nthat dignity transferred by the multitude to himself. Thus did he, out\nof a malignant design, but with discourse to those of his own tribe; when\nthese words did gradually spread to more people, and when the hearers still\nadded to what tended to the scandals that were cast upon the whole army\nwas full of them. Now of those that conspired with Corah, there were two\nhundred and fifty, and those of the principal men also, who were eager\nto have the priesthood taken away from Moses's brother, and to bring him\ninto disgrace: nay, the multitude themselves were provoked to be seditious,\nand attempted to stone Moses, wad gathered themselves together after an\nindecent manner, with confusion and disorder. And now all were, in a tumultuous\nmanner, raising a before the tabernacle of God, to prosecute the tyrant,\nand to relieve the multitude from their slavery under him who, under color\nof the Divine laid violent injunctions upon them; for had it been God who\nchose one that was to the office of a priest, he would have raised person\nto that dignity, and would not produced such a one as was inferior to many\nothers nor have given him that office; and that in he had judged it fit\nto bestow it on Aaron, he would have permitted it to the multitude to bestow\nit, and not have left it to be bestowed by his own brother.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Reland\nhere takes notice, that although our Bibles say little or nothing of these\nriches of Corah, yet that both the Jews and Mahommedans, as well as Josephus,\nare full of it."}, "#text": "Now although Moses had a great while ago foreseen this calumny of\nCorah, and had seen the people were irritated, yet was he not affrighted\nat it; but being of good courage, because given them right advice about\ntheir affairs, and knowing that his brother had been made partaker of the\npriesthood at the command of God, and not by his own favor to him, he came\nto the assembly; and as for the multitude, he said not a word to them,\nbut spake as loud to Corah as he could; and being very skillful in making\nspeeches, and having this natural talent, among others, that he could greatly\nmove the multitude with his discourses, he said, \"O Corah, both thou\nand all these with thee (pointing to the two hundred and fifty men) seem\nto be worthy of this honor; nor do I pretend but that this whole company\nmay be worthy of the like dignity, although they may not be so rich or\nso great as you are: nor have I taken and given this office to my brother\nbecause he excelled others in riches, for thou exceedest us both in the\ngreatness of thy wealth; \nnor indeed because he was of an eminent family, for God, by giving us the\nsame common ancestor, has made our families equal: nay, nor was it out\nof brotherly affection, which another might yet have justly done; for certainly,\nunless I had bestowed this honor out of regard to God, and to his laws,\nI had not passed by myself, and given it to another, as being nearer of\nkin to myself than to my brother, and having a closer intimacy with myself\nthan I have with him; for surely it would not be a wise thing for me to\nexpose myself to the dangers of offending, and to bestow the happy employment\non this account upon another. But I am above such base practices: nor would\nGod have overlooked this matter, and seen himself thus despised; nor would\nhe have suffered you to be ignorant of what you were to do, in order to\nplease him; but he hath himself chosen one that is to perform that sacred\noffice to him, and thereby freed us from that care. So that it was not\na thing that I pretend to give, but only according to the determination\nof God; I therefore propose it still to be contended for by such as please\nto put in for it, only desiring that he who has been already preferred,\nand has already obtained it, may be allowed now also to offer himself for\na candidate. He prefers your peace, and your living without sedition, to\nthis honorable employment, although in truth it was with your approbation\nthat he obtained it; for though God were the donor, yet do we not offend\nwhen we think fit to accept it with your good-will; yet would it have been\nan instance of impiety not to have taken that honorable employment when\nhe offered it; nay, it had been exceedingly unreasonable, when God had\nthought fit any one should have it for all time to come, and had made it\nsecure and firm to him, to have refused it. However, he himself will judge\nagain who it shall be whom he would have to offer sacrifices to him, and\nto have the direction of matters of religion; for it is absurd that Corah,\nwho is ambitious of this honor, should deprive God of the power of giving\nit to whom he pleases. Put an end, therefore, to your sedition and disturbance\non this account; and tomorrow morning do every one of you that desire the\npriesthood bring a censer from home, and come hither with incense and fire:\nand do thou, O Corah, leave the judgment to God, and await to see on which\nside he will give his determination upon this occasion, but do not thou\nmake thyself greater than God. Do thou also come, that this contest about\nthis honorable employment may receive determination. And I suppose we may\nadmit Aaron without offense, to offer himself to this scrutiny, since he\nis of the same lineage with thyself, and has done nothing in his priesthood\nthat can be liable to exception. Come ye therefore together, and offer\nyour incense in public before all the people; and when you offer it, he\nwhose sacrifice God shall accept shall be ordained to the priesthood, and\nshall be clear of the present calumny on Aaron, as if I had granted him\nthat favor because he was my brother.\""}, "WHEN Moses had said this, the multitude left off the turbulent behavior\nthey had indulged, and the suspicion they had of Moses, and commended what\nhe had said; for those proposals were good, and were so esteemed of the\npeople. At that time therefore they dissolved the assembly. But on the\nnext day they came to the congregation, in order to be present at the sacrifice,\nand at the determination that was to be made between the candidates for\nthe priesthood. Now this congregation proved a turbulent one, and the multitude\nwere in great suspense in expectation of what was to be done; for some\nof them would have been pleased if Moses had been convicted of evil practices,\nbut the wiser sort desired that they might be delivered from the present\ndisorder and disturbance; for they were afraid, that if this sedition went\non, the good order of their settlement would rather be destroyed; but the\nwhole body of the people do naturally delight in clamors against their\ngovernors, and, by changing their opinions upon the harangues of every\nspeaker, disturb the public tranquillity. And now Moses sent messengers\nfor Abiram and Dathan, and ordered them to come to the assembly, and wait\nthere for the holy offices that were to be performed. But they answered\nthe messenger, that they would not obey his summons; nay, would not overlook\nMoses's behavior, who was growing too great for them by evil practices.\nNow when Moses heard of this their answer, he desired the heads of the\npeople to follow him, and he went to the faction of Dathan, not thinking\nit any frightful thing at all to go to these insolent people; so they made\nno opposition, but went along with him. But Dathan, and his associates,\nwhen they understood that Moses and the principal of the people were coming\nto them, came out, with their wives and children, and stood before their\ntents, and looked to see what Moses would do. They had also their servants\nabout them to defend themselves, in case Moses should use force against\nthem.", "But he came near, and lifted up his hands to heaven, and cried out\nwith a loud voice, in order to be heard by the whole multitude, and said,\n\"O Lord of the creatures that are in the heaven, in the earth, and\nin the sea; for thou art the most authentic witness to what I have done,\nthat it has all been done by thy appointment, and that it was thou that\naffordedst us assistance when we attempted any thing, and showedst mercy\non the Hebrews in all their distresses; do thou come now, and hear all\nthat I say, for no action or thought escapes thy knowledge; so that thou\nwilt not disdain to speak what is true, for my vindication, without any\nregard to the ungrateful imputations of these men.

When I lived a\nprivate quiet life, I left those good things which, by my own diligence,\nand by thy counsel, I enjoyed with Raguel my father-in-law; and I gave\nmyself up to this people, and underwent many miseries on their account.\nI also bore great labors at first, in order to obtain liberty for them,\nand now in order to their preservation; and have always showed myself ready\nto assist them in every distress of theirs. Now, therefore, since I am\nsuspected by those very men whose being is owing to my labors, come thou,\nas it is reasonable to hope thou wilt; thou, I say, who showedst me that\nfire at mount Sinai, and madest me to hear its voice, and to see the several\nwonders which that place afforded thou who commandedst me to go to Egypt,\nand declare thy will to this people; thou who disturbest the happy estate\nof the Egyptians, and gavest us the opportunity of flying away from our\nunder them, and madest the dominion of Pharaoh inferior to my dominion;\nthou who didst make the sea dry land for us, when we knew not whither to\ngo, and didst overwhelm the Egyptians with those destructive waves which\nhad been divided for us; thou who didst bestow upon us the security of\nweapons when we were naked; thou who didst make the fountains that were\ncorrupted to flow, so as to be fit for drinking, and didst furnish us with\nwater that came out of the rocks, when we were in want of it; thou who\ndidst preserve our lives with [quails, which was] food from the sea, when\nthe fruits of the ground failed us; thou didst send us such food from heaven\nas had never been seen before; thou who didst suggest to us the knowledge\nof thy laws, and appoint to us a of government, - come thou, I say, O Lord\nof the whole world, and that as such a Judge and a Witness to me as cannot\nbe bribed, and show how I never admitted of any gift against justice from\nany of the Hebrews; and have never condemned a man that ought to have been\nacquitted, on account of one that was rich; and have never attempted to\nhurt this commonwealth. I am now and am suspected of a thing the remotest\nfrom my intentions, as if I had given the preisthood to Aaron, not at thy\ncommand, but out own favor to him; do thou at this time demonstrate that\nall things are administered by thy providence and that nothing happens\nby chance, but is governed by thy will, and thereby attains its end: as\nalso demonstrate that thou takest care that have done good to the Hebrews;\ndemonstrate this, I say, by the punishment of Abiram and Dathan, who condemn\nthee as an insensible Being, and one overcome by my contrivances. This\nthou do by inflicting such an open punishment on these men who so madly\nfly in the face of thy glory, as will take them out of the world, not in\nan manner, but so that it may appear they do die after the manner of other\nmen: let that ground which they tread upon open about them and consume\nthem, with their families and goods. This will be a demonstration of thy\npower to all and this method of their sufferings will be an instruction\nof wisdom for those that entertain profane sentiments of thee. By this\nmeans I shall be a good servant, in the precepts thou hast given by me.\nBut if the calumnies they have raised against me be true, mayst thou preserve\nthese men from every evil accident, and bring all that destruction on me\nwhich I have imprecated upon them. And when thou hast inflicted punishment\non those that have endeavored to deal unjustly with this people, bestow\nupon them concord and peace. Save this multitude that follow thy commandments,\nand preserve them free from harm, and let them not partake of the punishment\nof those that have sinned; for thou knowest thyself it is not just, that\nfor the wickedness of those men the whole body of the Israelites should\nsuffer punishment.\"", "When Moses had said this, with tears in his eyes, the ground was\nmoved on a sudden; and the agitation that set it in motion was like that\nwhich the wind produces in waves of the sea. The people were all aftrighted;\nand the ground that was about their tents sunk down at the great noise,\nwith a terrible sound, and carried whatsoever was dear to the seditious\ninto itself, who so entirely perished, that there was not the least appearance\nthat any man had ever been seen there, the earth that had opened itself\nabout them, closing again, and becoming entire as it was before, insomuch\nthat such as saw it afterward did not perceive that any such accident had\nhappened to it. Thus did these men perish, and become a demonstration of\nthe power of God. And truly, any one would lament them, not only on account\nof this calamity that befell them, which yet deserves our commiseration,\nbut also because their kindred were pleased with their sufferings; for\nthey forgot the relation they bare to them, and at the sight of this sad\naccident approved of the judgment given against them; and because they\nlooked upon the people about Dathan as pestilent men, they thought they\nperished as such, and did not grieve for them.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "It\nappears here, and from the Samaritan Pentateuch, and, in effect, from the\npsalmist, as also from the Apostolical Constitutions, from Clement's First\nEpistle to the Corinthians, from Ignatius's Epistle to the Magnesians,\nand from Eusebius, that Corah was not swallowed up with the Reubenites,\nbut burned with the Levites of his own tribe.

Hereupon\nMoses, after these men were destroyed, was desirous that the memory of\nthis judgment might be delivered down to posterity, and that future ages\nmight be acquainted with it; and so he commanded Eleazar, the son of Aaron,\nto put their censers near the brazen altar, that they might be a memorial\nto posterity of what these men suffered, for supposing that the power of\nGod might be eluded.

Virtue itself is indeed the principal and the first reward, and\nafter that it bestows abundance of others; so that your exercise of virtue\ntowards other men will make your own lives happy, and render you more glorious\nthan foreigners can be, and procure you an undisputed reputation with posterity.\nThese blessings you will be able to obtain, in case you hearken to and\nobserve those laws which, by Divine revelation, I have ordained for you;\nthat is, in case you withal meditate upon the wisdom that is in them.

Now those that\nmet them took no notice of them when they saw them, and supposed they were\nonly strangers, who used to be very curious in observing everything in\nthe city, and did not take them for enemies; but at even they retired to\na certain inn that was near to the wall, whither they went to eat their\nsupper; which supper when they had done, and were considering how to get\naway, information was given to the king as he was at supper, that there\nwere some persons come from the Hebrews' camp to view the city as spies,\nand that they were in the inn kept by Rahab, and were very solicitous that\nthey might not be discovered.

But when the tumult was over, Rahab brought\nthe men down, and desired them as soon as they should have obtained possession\nof the land of Canaan, when it would be in their power to make her amends\nfor her preservation of them, to remember what danger she had undergone\nfor their sakes; for that if she had been caught concealing them, she could\nnot have escaped a terrible destruction, she and all her family with her,\nand so bid them go home; and desired them to swear to her to preserve her\nand her family when they should take the city, and destroy all its inhabitants,\nas they had decreed to do; for so far she said she had been assured by\nthose Divine miracles of which she had been informed. So these spies acknowledged\nthat they owed her thanks for what she had done already, and withal swore\nto requite her kindness, not only in words, but in deeds. But they gave\nher this advice, That when she should perceive that the city was about\nto be taken, she should put her goods, and all her family, by way of security,\nin her inn, and to hang out scarlet threads before her doors, [or windows,]\nthat the commander of the Hebrews might know her house, and take care to\ndo her no harm; for, said they, we will inform him of this matter, because\nof the concern thou hast had to preserve us: but if any one of thy family\nfall in the battle, do not thou blame us; and we beseech that God, by whom\nwe have sworn, not then to be displeased with us, as though we had broken\nour oaths. So these men, when they had made this agreement, went away,\nletting themselves down by a rope from the wall, and escaped, and came\nand told their own people whatsoever they had done in their journey to\nthis city. Joshua also told Eleazar the high priest, and the senate, what\nthe spies had sworn to Rahab, who continued what had been sworn."}, "Now while Joshua, the commander, was in fear about their passing\nover Jordan, for the river ran with a strong current, and could not be\npassed over with bridges, for there never had been bridges laid over it\nhitherto; and while he suspected, that if he should attempt to make a bridge,\nthat their enemies would not afford him thee to perfect it, and for ferry-boats\nthey had none, - God promised so to dispose of the river, that they might\npass over it, and that by taking away the main part of its waters. So Joshua,\nafter two days, caused the army and the whole multitude to pass over in\nthe manner following: - The priests went first of all, having the ark with\nthem; then went the Levites bearing the tabernacle and the vessels which\nbelonged to the sacrifices; after which the entire multitude followed,\naccording to their tribes, having their children and their wives in the\nmidst of them, as being afraid for them, lest they should be borne away\nby the stream. But as soon as the priests had entered the river first,\nit appeared fordable, the depth of the water being restrained and the sand\nappearing at the bottom, because the current was neither so strong nor\nso swift as to carry it away by its force; so they all passed over the\nriver without fear, finding it to be in the very same state as God had\nforetold he would put it in; but the priests stood still in the midst of\nthe river till the multitude should be passed over, and should get to the\nshore in safety; and when all were gone over, the priests came out also,\nand permitted the current to run freely as it used to do before. Accordingly\nthe river, as soon as the Hebrews were come out of it, arose again presently,\nand carne to its own proper magnitude as before.", "So the Hebrews went on farther fifty furlongs, and pitched their\ncamp at the distance of ten furlongs from Jericho; but Joshua built an\naltar of those stones which all the heads of the tribes, at the command\nof the prophets, had taken out of the deep, to be afterwards a memorial\nof the division of the stream of this river, and upon it offered sacrifice\nto God; and in that place celebrated the passover, and had great plenty\nof all the things which they wanted hitherto; for they reaped the corn\nof the Canaanites, which was now ripe, and took other things as prey; for\nthen it was that their former food, which was manna, and of which they\nhad eaten forty years, failed them.", "Now while the Israelites did this, and the Canaanites did not attack\nthem, but kept themselves quiet within their own walls, Joshua resolved\nto besiege them; so on the first day of the feast [of the passover], the\npriests carried the ark round about, with some part of the armed men to\nbe a guard to it. These priests went forward, blowing with their seven\ntrumpets; and exhorted the army to be of good courage, and went round about\nthe city, with the senate following them; and when the priests had only\nblown with the trumpets, for they did nothing more at all, they returned\nto the camp. And when they had done this for six days, on the seventh Joshua\ngathered the armed men and all the people together, and told them these\ngood tidings, That the city should now be taken, since God would on that\nday give it them, by the falling down of the walls, and this of their own\naccord, and without their labor. However, he charged them to kill every\none they should take, and not to abstain from the slaughter of their enemies,\neither for weariness or for pity, and not to fall on the spoil, and be\nthereby diverted from pursuing their enemies as they ran away; but to destroy\nall the animals, and to take nothing for their own peculiar advantage.\nHe commanded them also to bring together all the silver and gold, that\nit might be set apart as first-fruits unto God out of this glorious exploit,\nas having gotten them from the city they first took; only that they should\nsave Rahab and her kindred alive, because of the oath which the spies had\nsworn to her.", "When he had said this, and had set his army in order, be brought\nit against the city: so they went round the city again, the ark going before\nthem, and the priests encouraging the people to be zealous in the work;\nand when they had gone round it seven times, and had stood still a little,\nthe wall fell down, while no instruments of war, nor any other force, was\napplied to it by the Hebrews.", "So they entered into Jericho, and slew all the men that were therein,\nwhile they were aftrighted at the surprising overthrow of the walls, and\ntheir courage was become useless, and they were not able to defend themselves;\nso they were slain, and their throats cut, some in the ways, and others\nas caught in their houses; nothing afforded them assistance, but they all\nperished, even to the women and the children; and the city was filled with\ndead bodies, and not one person escaped. They also burnt the whole city,\nand the country about it; but they saved alive Rahab, with her family,\nwho had fled to her inn. And when she was brought to him, Joshua owned\nto her that they owed her thanks for her preservation of the spies: so\nhe said he would not appear to be behind her in his benefaction to her;\nwhereupon he gave her certain lands immediately, and had her in great esteem\never afterwards.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Upon\noccasion of this devoting of Jericho to destruction, and the exemplary\npunishment of Achar, who broke that duerein or anathema, and of the punishment\nof the future breaker of it, Hiel, 1 Kings 16:34, as also of the punishment\nof Saul, for breaking the like chefera or anathema, against the Amalekites,\n1 Samuel 15., we may observe what was the true meaning of that law, Leviticus\n27:28: \"None devoted which shall be devoted of shall be redeemed;\nbut shall be put to death;\" i.e. whenever any of the Jews' public\nenemies had been, for their wickedness, solemnly devoted to destruction,\naccording to the Divine command, as were generally the seven wicked nations\nof Canaan, and those sinners the Amalekites, 1 Samuel 15:18, it was utterly\nunlawful to permit those enemies to be redeemed; but they were to be all\nutterly destroyed.

This Joshua told\nthe people; and calling for Eleazar the high priest, and the men in authority,\nhe cast lots, tribe by tribe; and when the lot showed that this wicked\naction was done by one of the tribe of Judah, he then again proposed the\nlot to the several families thereto belonging; so the truth of this wicked\naction was found to belong to the family of Zachar; and when the inquiry\nwas made man by man, they took Achar, who, upon God's reducing him\nto a terrible extremity, could not deny the fact: so he confessed the theft,\nand produced what he had taken in the midst of them, whereupon he was immediately\nput to death; and attained no more than to be buried in the night in a\ndisgraceful manner, and such as was suitable to a condemned malefactor.", "When Joshua had thus purified the host, he led them against Ai:\nand having by night laid an ambush round about the city, he attacked the\nenemies as soon as it was day; but as they advanced boldly against the\nIsraelites, because of their former victory, he made them believe he retired,\nand by that means drew them a great way from the city, they still supposing\nthat they were pursuing their enemies, and despised them, as though the\ncase had been the same with that in the former battle; after which Joshua\nordered his forces to turn about, and placed them against their front.\nHe then made the signals agreed upon to those that lay in ambush, and so\nexcited them to fight; so they ran suddenly into the city, the inhabitants\nbeing upon the walls, nay, others of them being in perplexity, and coming\nto see those that were without the gates. Accordingly, these men took the\ncity, and slew all that they met with; but Joshua forced those that came\nagainst him to come to a close fight, and discomfited them, and made them\nrun away; and when they were driven towards the city, and thought it had\nnot been touched, as soon as they saw it was taken, and perceived it was\nburnt, with their wives and children, they wandered about in the fields\nin a scattered condition, and were no way able to defend themselves, because\nthey had none to support them. Now when this calamity was come upon the\nmen of Ai, there were a great number of children, and women, and servants,\nand an immense quantity of other furniture.

Accordingly, upon their agreement to what they\nproposed, they sent ambassadors to Joshua to make a league of friendship\nwith him, and those such of the citizens as were best approved of, and\nmost capable of doing what was most advantageous to the multitude. Now\nthese ambassadors thought it dangerous to confess themselves to be Canaanites,\nbut thought they might by this contrivance avoid the danger, namely, by\nsaying that they bare no relation to the Canaanites at all, but dwelt at\na very great distance from them: and they said further, that they came\na long way, on account of the reputation he had gained for his virtue;\nand as a mark of the truth of what they said, they showed him the habit\nthey were in, for that their clothes were new when they came out, but were\ngreatly worn by the length of thee they had been on their journey; for\nindeed they took torn garments, on purpose that they might make him believe\nso. So they stood in the midst of the people, and said that they were sent\nby the people of Gibeon, and of the circumjacent cities, which were very\nremote from the land where they now were, to make such a league of friendship\nwith them, and this on such conditions as were customary among their forefathers;\nfor when they understood that, by the favor of God, and his gift to them,\nthey were to have the possession of the land of Canaan bestowed upon them,\nthey said that they were very glad to hear it, and desired to be admitted\ninto the number of their citizens. Thus did these ambassadors speak; and\nshowing them the marks of their long journey, they entreated the Hebrews\nto make a league of friendship with them. Accordingly Joshua, believing\nwhat they said, that they were not of the nation of the Canaanites, entered\ninto friendship with them; and Eleazar the high priest, with the senate,\nsware to them that they would esteem them their friends and associates,\nand would attempt nothing that should be unfair against them, the multitude\nalso assenting to the oaths that were made to them. So these men, having\nobtained what they desired, by deceiving the Israelites, went home: but\nwhen Joshua led his army to the country at the bottom of the mountains\nof this part of Canaan, he understood that the Gibeonites dwelt not far\nfrom Jerusalem, and that they were of the stock of the Canaanites; so he\nsent for their governors, and reproached them with the cheat they had put\nupon him; but they alleged, on their own behalf, that they had no other\nway to save themselves but that, and were therefore forced to have recourse\nto it. So he called for Eleazar the high priest, and for the senate, who\nthought it right to make them public servants, that they might not break\nthe oath they had made to them; and they ordained them to be so.

And now there went a great\nfame abroad among the neighboring people of the courage of the Hebrews;\nand those that heard what a number of men were destroyed, were greatly\naftrighted at it: so the kings that lived about Mount Libanus, who were\nCanaanites, and those Canaanites that dwelt in the plain country, with\nauxiliaries out of the land of the Philistines, pitched their camp at Beroth,\na city of the Upper Galilee, not far from Cadesh, which is itself also\na place in Galilee. Now the number of the whole army was three hundred\nthousand armed footmen, and ten thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand\nchariots; so that the multitude of the enemies aftrighted both Joshua himself\nand the Israelites; and they, instead of being full of hopes of good success,\nwere superstitiously timorous, with the great terror with which they were\nstricken. Whereupon God upbraided them with the fear they were in, and\nasked them whether they desired a greater help than he could afford them;\nand promised them that they should overcome their enemies; and withal charged\nthem to make their enemies' horses useless, and to burn their chariots.\nSo Joshua became full of courage upon these promises of God, and went out\nsuddenly against the enemies; and after five days' march he came upon them,\nand joined battle with them, and there was a terrible fight, and such a\nnumber were slain as could not be believed by those that heard it. He also\nwent on in the pursuit a great way, and destroyed the entire army of the\nenemies, few only excepted, and all the kings fell in the battle; insomuch,\nthat when there wanted men to be killed, Joshua slew their horses, and\nburnt their chariots and passed all over their country without opposition,\nno one daring to meet him in battle; but he still went on, taking their\ncities by siege, and again killing whatever he took.", "The fifth year was now past, and there was not one of the Canaanites\nremained any longer, excepting some that had retired to places of great\nstrength. So Joshua removed his camp to the mountainous country, and placed\nthe tabernacle in the city of Shiloh, for that seemed a fit place for it,\nbecause of the beauty of its situation, until such thee as their affairs\nwould permit them to build a temple; and from thence he went to Shechem,\ntogether with all the people, and raised an altar where Moses had beforehand\ndirected; then did he divide the army, and placed one half of them on Mount\nGerizzim, and the other half on Mount Ebal, on which mountain the altar\nwas; he also placed there the tribe of Levi, and the priests.

And as for the\ncities, since some of them were taken, but the others must be taken in\nlength of thee, by long sieges, both on account of the strength of their\nwalls, and of the confidence the inhabitants had in them thereby, he thought\nit reasonable that those tribes that came along with them from beyond Jordan,\nand had partaken of the dangers they had undergone, being their own kindred,\nshould now be dismissed and sent home, and should have thanks for the pains\nthey had taken together with them.

He also gave them a charge\nto estimate the measure of that part of the land that was most fruitful,\nand what was not so good: for such is the nature of the land of Canaan,\nthat one may see large plains, and such as are exceeding fit to produce\nfruit, which yet, if they were compared to other parts of the country,\nmight be reckoned exceedingly fruitful; yet, if it be compared with the\nfields about Jericho, and to those that belong to Jerusalem, will appear\nto be of no account at all; and although it so falls out that these people\nhave but a very little of this sort of land, and that it is, for the main,\nmountainous also, yet does it not come behind other parts, on account of\nits exceeding goodness and beauty; for which reason Joshua thought the\nland for the tribes should be divided by estimation of its goodness, rather\nthan the largeness of its measure, it often happening that one acre of\nsome sort of land was equivalent to a thousand other acres.

We, therefore, return you\nour thanks for the dangers you have undergone with us, and we do it not\nat this thee only, but we shall always be thus disposed; and be so good\nas to remember our friends, and to preserve in mind what advantages we\nhave had from them; and how you have put off the enjoyments of your own\nhappiness for our sakes, and have labored for what we have now, by the\ngoodwill of God, obtained, and resolved not to enjoy your own prosperity\ntill you had afforded us that assistance. However, you have, by joining\nyour labor with ours, gotten great plenty of riches, and will carry home\nwith you much prey, with gold and silver, and, what is more than all these,\nour good-will towards you, and a mind willingly disposed to make a requital\nof your kindness to us, in what case soever you shall desire it, for you\nhave not omitted any thing which Moses beforehand required of you, nor\nhave you despised him because he was dead and gone from you, so that there\nis nothing to diminish that gratitude which we owe to you. We therefore\ndismiss you joyful to your own inheritances; and we entreat you to suppose,\nthat there is no limit to be set to the intimate relation that is between\nus; and that you will not imagine, because this river is interposed between\nus, that you are of a different race from us, and not Hebrews; for we are\nall the posterity of Abraham, both we that inhabit here, and you that inhabit\nthere; and it is the same God that brought our forefathers and yours into\nthe world, whose worship and form of government we are to take care of,\nwhich he has ordained, and are most carefully to observe; because while\nyou continue in those laws, God will also show himself merciful and assisting\nto you; but if you imitate the other nations, and forsake those laws, he\nwill reject your nation.\" When Joshua had spoken thus, and saluted\nthem all, both those in authority one by one, and the whole multitude in\ncommon, he himself staid where he was; but the people conducted those tribes\non their journey, and that not without tears in their eyes; and indeed\nthey hardly knew how to part one from the other.", "Now when the tribe of Reuben, and that of Gad, and as many of the\nManassites as followed them, were passed over the river, they built an\naltar on the banks of Jordan, as a monument to posterity, and a sign of\ntheir relation to those that should inhabit on the other side. But when\nthose on the other side heard that those who had been dismissed had built\nan altar, but did not hear with what intention they built it, but supposed\nit to be by way of innovation, and for the introduction of strange gods,\nthey did not incline to disbelieve it; but thinking this defamatory report,\nas if it were built for divine worship, was credible, they appeared in\narms, as though they would avenge themselves on those that built the altar;\nand they were about to pass over the river, and to punish them for their\nsubversion of the laws of their country; for they did not think it fit\nto regard them on account of their kindred or the dignity of those that\nhad given the occasion, but to regard the will of God, and the manner wherein\nhe desired to be worshipped; so these men put themselves in array for war.\nBut Joshua, and Eleazar the high priest, and the senate, restrained them;\nand persuaded them first to make trial by words of their intention, and\nafterwards, if they found that their intention was evil, then only to proceed\nto make war upon them. Accordingly, they sent as ambassadors to them Phineas\nthe son of Eleazar, and ten more persons that were in esteem among the\nHebrews, to learn of them what was in their mind, when, upon passing over\nthe river, they had built an altar upon its banks. And as soon as these\nambassadors were passed over, and were come to them, and a congregation\nwas assembled, Phineas stood up and said, That the offense they had been\nguilty of was of too heinous a nature to be punished by words alone, or\nby them only to be amended for the future; yet that they did not so look\nat the heinousness of their transgression as to have recourse to arms,\nand to a battle for their punishment immediately, but that, on account\nof their kindred, and the probability there was that they might be reclaimed,\nthey took this method of sending an ambassage to them: \"That when\nwe have learned the true reasons by which you have been moved to build\nthis altar, we may neither seem to have been too rash in assaulting you\nby our weapons of war, if it prove that you made the altar for justifiable\nreasons, and may then justly punish you if the accusation prove true; for\nwe can\nhardly suppose that you, have been acquainted with the will of God and\nhave been hearers of those laws which he himself hath given us, now you\nare separated from us, and gone to that patrimony of yours, which you,\nthrough the grace of God, and that providence which he exercises over you,\nhave obtained by lot, can forget him, and can leave that ark and that altar\nwhich is peculiar to us, and can introduce strange gods, and imitate the\nwicked practices of the Canaanites. Now this will appear to have been a\nsmall crime if you repent now, and proceed no further in your madness,\nbut pay a due reverence to, and keep in mind the laws of your country;\nbut if you persist in your sins, we will not grudge our pains to preserve\nour laws; but we will pass over Jordan and defend them, and defend God\nalso, and shall esteem of you as of men no way differing from the Canaanites,\nbut shall destroy you in the like manner as we destroyed them; for do not\nyou imagine that, because you are got over the river, you are got out of\nthe reach of God's power; you are every where in places that belong to\nhim, and impossible it is to overrun his power, and the punishment he will\nbring on men thereby: but if you think that your settlement here will be\nany obstruction to your conversion to what is good, nothing need hinder\nus from dividing the land anew, and leaving this old land to be for the\nfeeding of sheep; but you will do well to return to your duty, and to leave\noff these new crimes; and we beseech you, by your children and wives, not\nto force us to punish you. Take therefore such measures in this assembly,\nas supposing that your own safety, and the safety of those that are dearest\nto you, is therein concerned, and believe that it is better for you to\nbe conquered by words, than to continue in your purpose, and to experience\ndeeds and war therefore.\"", "When Phineas had discoursed thus, the governors of the assembly,\nand the whole multitude, began to make an apology for themselves, concerning\nwhat they were accused of; and they said, That they neither would depart\nfrom the relation they bare to them, nor had they built the altar by way\nof innovation; that they owned one and the same common God with all the\nHebrews, and that brazen altar which was before the tabernacle, on which\nthey would offer their sacrifices; that as to the altar they had raised,\non account of which they were thus suspected, it was not built for worship,\n\"but that it might be a sign and a monument of our relation to you\nfor ever, and a necessary caution to us to act wisely, and to continue\nin the laws of our country, but not a handle for transgressing them, as\nyou suspect: and let God be our authentic witness, that this was the occasion\nof our building this altar: whence we beg you will have a better opinion\nof us, and do not impute such a thing to us as would render any of the\nposterity of Abraham well worthy of perdition, in case they attempt to\nbring in new rites, and such as are different from our usual practices.\"", "When they had made this answer, and Phineas had commended them for\nit, he came to Joshua, and explained before the people what answer they\nhad received. Now Joshua was glad that he was under no necessity of setting\nthem in array, or of leading them to shed blood, and make war against men\nof their own kindred; and accordingly he offered sacrifices of thanksgiving\nto God for the same. So Joshua after that dissolved this great assembly\nof the people, and sent them to their own inheritances, while he himself\nlived in Shechem. But in the twentieth year after this, when he was very\nold, he sent for those of the greatest dignity in the several cities, with\nthose in authority, and the senate, and as many of the common people as\ncould be present; and when they were come, he put them in mind of all the\nbenefits God had bestowed on them, which could not but be a great many,\nsince from a low estate they were advanced to so great a degree of glory\nand plenty; and exhorted them to take notice of the intentions of God,\nwhich had been so gracious towards them; and told them that the Deity would\ncontinue their friend by nothing else but their piety; and that it was\nproper for him, now that he was about to depart out of this life, to leave\nsuch an admonition to them; and he desired that they would keep in memory\nthis his exhortation to them.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Since\nnot only Procopius and Suidas, but an earlier author, Moses Chorenensis,\np. 52, 53, and perhaps from his original author Mariba Carina, one as old\nas Alexander the Great, sets down the famous inscription at Tangier concerning\nthe old Canaanites driven out of Palestine by Joshua, take it here in that\nauthor's own words: \"We are those exiles that were governors of the\nCanaanites, but have been driven away by Joshua the robber, and are come\nto inhabit here.\" See the note there.

The Israelites also gave\nthem the four hundred virgins of Jabesh Gilead for wives; but as to the\nremaining two hundred, they deliberated about it how they might compass\nwives enough for them, and that they might have children by them; and whereas\nthey had, before the war began, taken an oath, that no one would give his\ndaughter to wife to a Benjamite, some advised them to have no regard to\nwhat they had sworn, because the oath had not been taken advisedly and\njudiciously, but in a passion, and thought that they should do nothing\nagainst God, if they were able to save a whole tribe which was in danger\nof perishing; and that perjury was then a sad and dangerous thing, not\nwhen it is done out of necessity, but when it is done with a wicked intention.\nBut when the senate were affrighted at the very name of perjury, a certain\nperson told them that he could show them a way whereby they might procure\nthe Benjamites wives enough, and yet keep their oath. They asked him what\nhis proposal was. He said, \"That three times in a year, when we meet\nin Shiloh, our wives and our daughters accompany us: let then the Benjamites\nbe allowed to steal away, and marry such women as they can catch, while\nwe will neither incite them nor forbid them; and when their parents take\nit ill, and desire us to inflict punishment upon them, we will tell them,\nthat they were themselves the cause of what had happened, by neglecting\nto guard their daughters, and that they ought not to be over angry at the\nBenjamites, since that anger was permitted to rise too high already.\"\nSo the Israelites were persuaded to follow this advice, and decreed, That\nthe Benjamites should be allowed thus to steal themselves wives. So when\nthe festival was coming on, these two hundred Benjamites lay in ambush\nbefore the city, by two and three together, and waited for the coming\nof the virgins, in the vineyards and other places where they could lie\nconcealed. Accordingly the virgins came along playing, and suspected nothing\nof what was coming upon them, and walked after an unguarded manner, so\nthose that laid scattered in the road, rose up, and caught hold of them:\nby this means these Benjamites got them wives, and fell to agriculture,\nand took good care to recover their former happy state. And thus was this\ntribe of the Benjamites, after they had been in danger of entirely perishing,\nsaved in the manner forementioned, by the wisdom of the Israelites; and\naccordingly it presently flourished, and soon increased to be a multitude,\nand came to enjoy all other degrees of happiness. And such was the conclusion\nof this war."}, "NOW it happened that the tribe of Dan suffered in like manner with\nthe tribe of Benjamin; and it came to do so on the occasion following:\n- When the Israelites had already left off the exercise of their arms for\nwar, and were intent upon their husbandry, the Canaanites despised them,\nand brought together an army, not because they expected to suffer by them,\nbut because they had a mind to have a sure prospect of treating the Hebrews\nill when they pleased, and might thereby for the time to come dwell in\ntheir own cities the more securely; they prepared therefore their chariots,\nand gathered their soldiery together, their cities also combined together,\nand drew over to them Askelon and Ekron, which were within the tribe of\nJudah, and many more of those that lay in the plain. They also forced the\nDanites to fly into the mountainous country, and left them not the least\nportion of the plain country to set their foot on. Since then these Danites\nwere not able to fight them, and had not land enough to sustain them, they\nsent five of their men into the midland country, to seek for a land to\nwhich they might remove their habitation. So these men went as far as the\nneighborhood of Mount Libanus, and the fountains of the Lesser Jordan,\nat the great plain of Sidon, a day's journey from the city; and when they\nhad taken a view of the land, and found it to be good and exceeding fruitful,\nthey acquainted their tribe with it, whereupon they made an expedition\nwith the army, and built there the city Dan, of the same name with the\nson of Jacob, and of the same name with their own tribe.", "The Israelites grew so indolent, and unready of taking pains, that\nmisfortunes came heavier upon them, which also proceeded in part from their\ncontempt of the Divine worship; for when they had once fallen off from\nthe regularity of their political government, they indulged themselves\nfurther in living according to their own pleasure, and according to their\nown will, till they were full of the evil doings that were common among\nthe Canaanites.

Now when they had done this for\nthree years, the multitude of the Israelites retired to the mountains,\nand forsook the plain country.

The enemy's camp took up a large\nspace of ground, for it happened that they had a great many camels; and\nas they were divided into different nations, so they were all contained\nin one circle. Now when the Hebrews did as they were ordered beforehand,\nupon their approach to their enemies, and, on the signal given, sounded\nwith their rams' horns, and brake their pitchers, and set upon their enemies\nwith their lamps, and a great shout, and cried, \"Victory to Gideon,\nby God's assistance,\" a disorder and a fright seized upon the other\nmen while they were half asleep, for it was night-time, as God would have\nit; so that a few of them were slain by their enemies, but the greatest\npart by their own soldiers, on account of the diversity of their language;\nand when they were once put into disorder, they killed all that they met\nwith, as thinking them to be enemies also. Thus there was a great slaughter\nmade. And as the report of Gideon's victory came to the Israelites, they\ntook their weapons and pursued their enemies, and overtook them in a certain\nvalley encompassed with torrents, a place which these could not get over;\nso they encompassed them, and slew them all, with their kings, Oreb and\nZeeb. But the remaining captains led those soldiers that were left, which\nwere about eighteen thousand, and pitched their camp a great way off the\nIsraelites. However, Gideon did not grudge his pains, but pursued them\nwith all his army, and joining battle with them, cut off the whole enemies'\narmy, and took the other leaders, Zeba and Zalmuna, and made them captives.\nNow there were slain in this battle of the Midianites, and of their auxiliaries\nthe Arabians, about a hundred and twenty thousand; and the Hebrews took\na great prey, gold, and silver, and garments, and camels, and asses.

And by this method\nof cooling their passions, he brought more advantage to the Hebrews, than\nby the success he had against these enemies, for he thereby delivered them\nfrom a sedition which was arising among them; yet did this tribe afterwards\nsuffer the punishment of this their injurious treatment of Gideon, of which\nwe will give an account in due time.", "Hereupon Gideon would have laid down the government, but was over-persuaded\nto take it, which he enjoyed forty years, and distributed justice to them,\nas the people came to him in their differences; and what he determined\nwas esteemed valid by all.

So when he had said this,\nhe went away, and lived privately in the mountains for three years, out\nof fear of Abimelech.", "A little while after this festival, the Shechemites, who had now\nrepented themselves of having slain the sons of Gideon, drove Abimelech\naway, both from their city and their tribe; whereupon he contrived how\nhe might distress their city. Now at the season of vintage, the people\nwere afraid to go out and gather their fruits, for fear Abimelech should\ndo them some mischief. Now it happened that there had come to them a man\nof authority, one Gaal, that sojourned with them, having his armed men\nand his kinsmen with him; so the Shechemites desired that he would allow\nthem a guard during their vintage; whereupon he accepted of their desires,\nand so the people went out, and Gaal with them at the head of his soldiery.\nSo they gathered their fruit with safety; and when they were at supper\nin several companies, they then ventured to curse Abimelech openly; and\nthe magistrates laid ambushes in places about the city, and caught many\nof Abimelech's followers, and destroyed them.", "Now there was one Zebul, a magistrate of the Shechemites, that had\nentertained Abimelech. He sent messengers, and informed him how much Gaal\nhad irritated the people against him, and excited him to lay ambushes before\nthe city, for that he would persuade Gaal to go out against him, which\nwould leave it in his power to be revenged on him; and when that was once\ndone, he would bring him to be reconciled to the city. So Abimelech laid\nambushes, and himself lay with them. Now Gaal abode in the suburbs, taking\nlittle care of himself; and Zebul was with him. Now as Gaal saw the armed\nmen coming on, he said to Zebul, That some armed men were coming; but the\nother replied, They were only shadows of huge stones: and when they were\ncome nearer, Gaal perceived what was the reality, and said, They were not\nshadows, but men lying in ambush. Then said Zebul, \"Didst not thou\nreproach Abimelech for cowardice? why dost thou not then show how very\ncourageous thou art thyself, and go and fight him?\" So Gaal, being\nin disorder, joined battle with Abimelech, and some of his men fell; whereupon\nhe fled into the city, and took his men with him. But Zebul managed his\nmatters so in the city, that he procured them to expel Gaal out of the\ncity, and this by accusing him of cowardice in this action with the soldiers\nof Ahimelech. But Abimelech, when he had learned that the Shechemites were\nagain coming out to gather their grapes, placed ambushes before the city,\nand when they were coming out, the third part of his army took possession\nof the gates, to hinder the citizens from returning in again, while the\nrest pursued those that were scattered abroad, and so there was slaughter\nevery where; and when he had overthrown the city to the very foundations,\nfor it was not able to bear a siege, and had sown its ruins with salt,\nhe proceeded on with his army till all the Shechemites were slain. As for\nthose that were scattered about the country, and so escaped the danger,\nthey were gathered together unto a certain strong rock, and settled themselves\nupon it, and prepared to build a wall about it: and when Abimelech knew\ntheir intentions, he prevented them, and came upon them with his forces,\nand laid faggots of dry wood round the place, he himself bringing some\nof them, and by his example encouraging the soldiers to do the same. And\nwhen the rock was encompassed round about with these faggots, they set\nthem on fire, and threw in whatsoever by nature caught fire the most easily:\nso a mighty flame was raised, and nobody could fly away from the rock,\nbut every man perished, with their wives and children, in all about fifteen\nhundred men, and the rest were a great number also.

So he underwent this\ndeath as a punishment for the wickedness he had perpetrated against his\nbrethren, and his insolent barbarity to the Shechemites.

He had children by the latter; but he loved the other best, although\nshe was barren. Now Elcanah came with his wives to the city Shiloh to sacrifice,\nfor there it was that the tabernacle of God was fixed, as we have formerly\nsaid. Now when, after he had sacrificed, he distributed at that festival\nportions of the flesh to his wives and children, and when Hannah saw the\nother wife's children sitting round about their mother, she fell into tears,\nand lamented herself on account of her barrenness and lonesomeness; and\nsuffering her grief to prevail over her husband's consolations to her,\nshe went to the tabernacle to beseech God to give her seed, and to make\nher a mother; and to vow to consecrate the first son she should bear to\nthe service of God, and this in such a way, that his manner of living should\nnot be like that of ordinary men. And as she continued at her prayers a\nlong time, Eli, the high priest, for he sat there before the tabernacle,\nbid her go away, thinking she had been disordered with wine; but when she\nsaid she had drank water, but was in sorrow for want of children, and was\nbeseeching God for them, he bid her be of good cheer, and told her that\nGod would send her children.", {"emph": "asked of God", "#text": "So she came to her husband full of hope, and ate her meal with gladness.\nAnd when they had returned to their own country she found herself with\nchild, and they had a son born to them, to whom they gave the name of Samuel,\nwhich may be styled one that was . They therefore came\nto the tabernacle to offer sacrifice for the birth of the child, and brought\ntheir tithes with them; but the woman remembered the vows she had made\nconcerning her son, and delivered him to Eli, dedicating him to God, that\nhe might become a prophet.

Eli was then so far illuminated,\nthat he said to him, \"Indeed, Samuel, I was silent now as well as\nbefore: it is God that calls thee; do thou therefore signify it to him,\nand say, I am here ready.\" So when he heard God speak again, he desired\nhim to speak, and to deliver what oracles he pleased to him, for he would\nnot fail to perform any ministration whatsoever he should make use of him\nin; - to which God replied, \"Since thou art here ready, learn what\nmiseries are coming upon the Israelites, - such indeed as words cannot\ndeclare, nor faith believe; for the sons of Eli shall die on one day, and\nthe priesthood shall be transferred into the family of Eleazar; for Eli\nhath loved his sons more than he hath loved my worship, and to such a degree\nas is not for their advantage.\" Which message Eli obliged the prophet\nby oath to tell him, for otherwise he had no inclination to afflict him\nby telling it.

So he promised them that he would beseech God, and persuade him to\nforgive them these their sins.

And on account of this prohibition it\nwas that the husbandmen, if they had occasion to sharpen any of their tools,\nwhether it were the coulter or the spade, or any instrument of husbandry,\nthey came to the Philistines to do it. Now as soon as the Philistines heard\nof this slaughter of their garrison, they were in a rage about it, and,\nlooking on this contempt as a terrible affront offered them, they made\nwar against the Jews, with three hundred thousand footmen, and thirty thousand\nchariots, and six thousand horses; and they pitched their camp at the city\nMichmash. When Saul, the king of the Hebrews, was informed of this, he\nwent down to the city Gilgal, and made proclamation over all the country,\nthat they should try to regain their liberty; and called them to the war\nagainst the Philistines, diminishing their forces, and despising them as\nnot very considerable, and as not so great but they might hazard a battle\nwith them.

Whether,\nif there were a city or country of lay Christians without any clergymen,\nit were lawful for the laity alone to baptize, or celebrate the eucharist,\netc., or indeed whether they alone could ordain themselves either bishops,\npriests, or deacons, for the due performance of such sacerdotal ministrations;\nor whether they ought not rather, till they procure clergymen to come among\nthem, to confine themselves within those bounds of piety and Christianity\nwhich belong alone to the laity; such particularly as are recommended in\nthe first book of the Apostolical Constitutions, which peculiarly concern\nthe laity, and are intimated in Clement's undoubted epistle, sect. 40.\nTo which latter opinion I incline."}], "#text": "But Saul sent to the prophet, and called him to consult with him\nabout the war and the public affairs; so he commanded him to stay there\nfor him, and to prepare sacrifices, for he would come to him within seven\ndays, that they might offer sacrifices on the seventh day, and might then\njoin battle with their enemies. So he waited \nas the prophet sent to him to do; yet did not he, however, observe the\ncommand that was given him, but when he saw that the prophet tarried longer\nthan he expected, and that he was deserted by the soldiers, he took the\nsacrifices and offered them; and when he heard that Samuel was come, he\nwent out to meet him. But the prophet said he had not done well in disobeying\nthe injunctions he had sent to him, and had not staid till his coming,\nwhich being appointed according to the will of God, he had prevented him\nin offering up those prayers and those sacrifices that he should have made\nfor the multitude, and that he therefore had performed Divine offices in\nan ill manner, and had been rash in performing them. Hereupon Saul made\nan apology for himself, and said that he had waited as many days as Samuel\nhad appointed him; that he had been so quick in offering his sacrifices,\nupon account of the necessity he was in, and because his soldiers were\ndeparting from him, out of their fear of the enemy's camp at Michmash,\nthe report being gone abroad that they were coming down upon him of Gilgal.\nTo which Samuel replied, \"Nay, certainly, if thou hadst been a righteous\nman, \nand hadst not disobeyed me, nor slighted the commands which God suggested\nto me concerning the present state of affairs, and hadst not acted more\nhastily than the present circumstances required, thou wouldst have been\npermitted to reign a long time, and thy posterity after thee.\" So\nSamuel, being grieved at what happened, returned home; but Saul came to\nthe city Gibeah, with his son Jonathan, having only six hundred men with\nhim; and of these the greater part had no weapons, because of the scarcity\nof iron in that country, as well as of those that could make such weapons;\nfor, as we showed a little before, the Philistines had not suffered them\nto have such iron or such workmen. Now the Philistines divided their army\ninto three companies, and took as many roads, and laid waste the country\nof the Hebrews, while king Saul and his son Jonathan saw what was done,\nbut were not able to defend the land, having no more than six hundred men\nwith them. But as he, and his son, and Abiah the high priest, who was of\nthe posterity of Eli the high priest, were sitting upon a pretty high hill,\nand seeing the land laid waste, they were mightily disturbed at it. Now\nSaul's son agreed with his armor-bearer, that they would go privately to\nthe enemy's camp, and make a tumult and a disturbance among them. And when\nthe armor-bearer had readily promised to follow him whithersoever he should\nlead him, though he should be obliged to die in the attempt, Jonathan made\nuse of the young man's assistance, and descended from the hill, and went\nto their enemies. Now the enemy's camp was upon a precipice which had three\ntops, that ended in a small but sharp and long extremity, while there was\na rock that surrounded them, like lines made to prevent the attacks of\nan enemy. There it so happened, that the out-guards of the camp were neglected,\nbecause of the security that here arose from the situation of the place,\nand because they thought it altogether impossible, not only to ascend up\nto the camp on that quarter, but so much as to come near it. As soon, therefore,\nas they came to the camp, Jonathan encouraged his armor-bearer, and said\nto him, \"Let us attack our enemies; and if, when they see us, they\nbid us come up to them, take that for a signal of victory; but if they\nsay nothing, as not intending to invite us to come up, let us return back\nagain.\" So when they were approaching to the enemy's camp, just after\nbreak of day, and the Philistines saw them, they said one to another, \"The\nHebrews come out of their dens and caves:\" and they said to Jonathan\nand to his armor-bearer, \"Come on, ascend up to us, that we may inflict\na just punishment upon you, for your rash attempt upon us.\" So Saul's\nson accepted of that invitation, as what signified to him victory, and\nhe immediately came out of the place whence they were seen by their enemies:\nso he changed his place, and came to the rock, which had none to guard\nit, because of its own strength; from thence they crept up with great labor\nand difficulty, and so far overcame by force the nature of the place, till\nthey were able to fight with their enemies. So they fell upon them as they\nwere asleep, and slew about twenty of them, and thereby filled them with\ndisorder and surprise, insomuch that some of them threw away their entire\narmor and fled; but the greatest part, not knowing one another, because\nthey were of different nations, suspected one another to be enemies, (for\nthey did not imagine there were only two of the Hebrews that came up,)\nand so they fought one against another; and some of them died in the battle,\nand some, as they were flying away, were thrown down from the rock headlong."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This rash vow or curse of Saul, which Josephus says was confirmed by the\npeople, and yet not executed, I suppose principally because Jonathan did\nnot know of it, is very remarkable; it being of the essence of the obligation\nof all laws, that they be sufficiently known and promulgated, otherwise\nthe conduct of Providence, as to the sacredness of solemn oaths and vows,\nin God's refusing to answer by Urim till this breach of Saul's vow or curse\nwas understood and set right, and God propitiated by public prayer, is\nhere very remarkable, as indeed it is every where else in the Old Testament."}, "#text": "Now Saul's watchmen told the king that the camp of the Philistines\nwas in confusion; then he inquired whether any body was gone away from\nthe army; and when he heard that his son, and with him his armor-bearer,\nwere absent, he bade the high priest take the garments of his high priesthood,\nand prophesy to him what success they should have; who said that they should\nget the victory, and prevail against their enemies. So he went out after\nthe Philistines, and set upon them as they were slaying one another. Those\nalso who had fled to dens and caves, upon hearing that Saul was gaining\na victory, came running to him. When, therefore, the number of the Hebrews\nthat came to Saul amounted to about ten thousand, he pursued the enemy,\nwho were scattered all over the country; but then he fell into an action,\nwhich was a very unhappy one, and liable to be very much blamed; for, whether\nout of ignorance or whether out of joy for a victory gained so strangely,\n(for it frequently happens that persons so fortunate are not then able\nto use their reason consistently,) as he was desirous to avenge himself,\nand to exact a due punishment of the Philistines, he denounced a curse\n upon\nthe Hebrews: That if any one put a stop to his slaughter of the enemy,\nand fell on eating, and left off the slaughter or the pursuit before the\nnight came on, and obliged them so to do, he should be accursed. Now after\nSaul had denounced this curse, since they were now in a wood belonging\nto the tribe of Ephraim, which was thick and full of bees, Saul's son,\nwho did not hear his father denounce that curse, nor hear of the approbation\nthe multitude gave to it, broke off a piece of a honey-comb, and ate part\nof it. But, in the mean time, he was informed with what a curse his father\nhad forbidden them to taste any thing before sun-setting: so he left off\neating, and said his father had not done well in this prohibition, because,\nhad they taken some food, they had pursued the enemy with greater rigor\nand alacrity, and had both taken and slain many more of their enemies."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Here we have still more indications of Saul's affectation of despotic power,\nand of his entrenching upon the priesthood, and making and endeavoring\nto execute a rash vow or curse, without consulting Samuel or the sanhedrim.\nIn this view it is also that I look upon this erection of a new altar by\nSaul, and his offering of burnt-offerings himself upon it, and not as any\nproper instance of devotion or religion, with other commentators."}, "#text": "When, therefore, they had slain many ten thousands of the Philistines,\nthey fell upon spoiling the camp of the Philistines, but not till late\nin the evening.

This was told to the king by the scribes,\nthat the multitude were sinning against God as they sacrificed, and were\neating before the blood was well washed away, and the flesh was made clean.\nThen did Saul give order that a great stone should be rolled into the midst\nof them, and he made proclamation that they should kill their sacrifices\nupon it, and not feed upon the flesh with the blood, for that was not acceptable\nto God. And when all the people did as the king commanded them, Saul erected\nan altar there, and offered burnt-offerings upon it to God \nThis was the first altar that Saul built."}, "So when Saul was desirous of leading his men to the enemy's camp\nbefore it was day, in order to plunder it, and when the soldiers were not\nunwilling to follow him, but indeed showed great readiness to do as he\ncommanded them, the king called Ahitub the high priest, and enjoined him\nto know of God whether he would grant them the favor and permission to\ngo against the enemy's camp, in order to destroy those that were in it.\nAnd when the priest said that God did not give any answer, Saul replied,\n\"And not without some cause does God refuse to answer what we inquire\nof him, while yet a little while ago he declared to us all that we desired\nbeforehand, and even prevented us in his answer. To be sure there is some\nsin against him that is concealed from us, which is the occasion of his\nsilence. Now I swear by him himself, that though he that hath committed\nthis sin should prove to be my own son Jonathan, I will slay him, and by\nthat means will appease the anger of God against us, and that in the very\nsame manner as if I were to punish a stranger, and one not at all related\nto me, for the same offense.\" So when the multitude cried out to him\nso to do, he presently set all the rest on one side, and he and his son\nstood on the other side, and he sought to discover the offender by lot.\nNow the lot appeared to fall upon Jonathan himself. So when he was asked\nby his father what sin he had been guilty of, and what he was conscious\nof in the course of his life that might be esteemed instances of guilt\nor profaneness, his answer was this, \"O father, I have done nothing\nmore than that yesterday, without knowing of the curse and oath thou hadst\ndenounced, while I was in pursuit of the enemy, I tasted of a honey-comb.\"\nBut Saul sware that he would slay him, and prefer the observation of his\noath before all the ties of birth and of nature. And Jonathan was not dismayed\nat this threatening of death, but, offering himself to it generously and\nundauntedly, he said, \"Nor do I desire you, father, to spare me: death\nwill be to me very acceptable, when it proceeds from thy piety, and after\na glorious victory; for it is the greatest consolation to me that I leave\nthe Hebrews victorious over the Philistines.\" Hereupon all the people\nwere very sorry, and greatly afflicted for Jonathan; and they sware that\nthey would not overlook Jonathan, and see him die, who was the author of\ntheir victory. By which means they snatched him out of the danger he was\nin from his father's curse, while they made their prayers to God also for\nthe young man, that he would remit his sin.", "So Saul, having slain about sixty thousand of the enemy, returned\nhome to his own city, and reigned happily: and he also fought against the\nneighboring nations, and subdued the Ammonites, and Moabites, and Philistines,\nand Edomites, and Amalekites, as also the king of Zobah.

Accordingly, Saul made an irruption\ninto the country of the Amalekites, and set many men in several parties\nin ambush at the river, that so he might not only do them a mischief by\nopen fighting, but might fall upon them unexpectedly in the ways, and might\nthereby compass them round about, and kill them. And when he had joined\nbattle with the enemy, he beat them; and pursuing them as they fled, he\ndestroyed them all. And when that undertaking had succeeded, according\nas God had foretold, he set upon the cities of the Amalekites; he besieged\nthem, and took them by force, partly by warlike machines, partly by mines\ndug under ground, and partly by building walls on the outsides. Some they\nstarved out with famine, and some they gained by other methods; and after\nall, he betook himself to slay the women and the children, and thought\nhe did not act therein either barbarously or inhumanly; first, because\nthey were enemies whom he thus treated, and, in the next place, because\nit was done by the command of God, whom it was dangerous not to obey. He\nalso took Agag, the enemies' king, captive, - the beauty and tallness of\nwhose body he admired so much, that he thought him worthy of preservation.\nYet was not this done however according to the will of God, but by giving\nway to human passions, and suffering himself to be moved with an unseasonable\ncommiseration, in a point where it was not safe for him to indulge it;\nfor God hated the nation of the Amalekites to such a degree, that he commanded\nSaul to have no pity on even those infants which we by nature chiefly compassionate;\nbut Saul preserved their king and governor from the miseries which the\nHebrews brought on the people, as if he preferred the fine appearance of\nthe enemy to the memory of what God had sent him about. The multitude were\nalso guilty, together with Saul; for they spared the herds and the flocks,\nand took them for a prey, when God had commanded they should not spare\nthem.

But God was grieved that the king of the Amalekites\nwas preserved alive, and that the multitude had seized on the cattle for\na prey, because these things were done without his permission; for he thought\nit an intolerable thing that they should conquer and overcome their enemies\nby that power which he gave them, and then that he himself should be so\ngrossly despised and disobeyed by them, that a mere man that was a king\nwould not bear it. He therefore told Samuel the prophet, that he repented\nthat he had made Saul king, while he did nothing that he had commanded\nhim, but indulged his own inclinations. When Samuel heard that, he was\nin confusion, and began to beseech God all that night to be reconciled\nto Saul, and not to be angry with him; but he did not grant that forgiveness\nto Saul which the prophet asked for, as not deeming it a fit thing to grant\nforgiveness of [such] sins at his entreaties, since injuries do not otherwise\ngrow so great as by the easy tempers of those that are injured; or while\nthey hunt after the glory of being thought gentle and good-natured, before\nthey are aware they produce other sins. As soon therefore as God had rejected\nthe intercession of the prophet, and it plainly appeared he would not change\nhis mind, at break of day Samuel came to Saul at Gilgal. When the king\nsaw him, he ran to him, and embraced him, and said, \"I return thanks\nto God, who hath given me the victory, for I have performed every thing\nthat he hath commanded me.\" To which Samuel replied, \"How is\nit then that I hear the bleating of the sheep and the lowing of the greater\ncattle in the camp?\" Saul made answer, \"That the people had reserved\nthem for sacrifices; but that, as to the nation of the Amalekites, it was\nentirely destroyed, as he had received it in command to see done, and that\nno one man was left; but that he had saved alive the king alone, and brought\nhim to him, concerning whom, he said, they would advise together what should\nbe done with him.\" But the prophet said, \"God is not delighted\nwith sacrifices, but with good and with righteous men, who are such as\nfollow his will and his laws, and never think that any thing is well done\nby them but when they do it as God had commanded them; that he then looks\nupon himself as affronted, not when any one does not sacrifice, but when\nany one appears to be disobedient to him. But that from those who do not\nobey him, nor pay him that duty which is the alone true and acceptable\nworship, he will not kindly accept their oblations, be those they offer\never so many and so fat, and be the presents they make him ever so ornamental,\nnay, though they were made of gold and silver themselves, but he will reject\nthem, and esteem them instances of wickedness, and not of piety. And that\nhe is delighted with those that still bear in mind this one thing, and\nthis only, how to do that, whatsoever it be, which God pronounces or commands\nfor them to do, and to choose rather to die than to transgress any of those\ncommands; nor does he require so much as a sacrifice from them. And when\nthese do sacrifice, though it be a mean oblation, he better accepts of\nit as the honor of poverty, than such oblations as come from the richest\nmen that offer them to him. Wherefore take notice, that thou art under\nthe wrath of God, for thou hast despised and neglected what he commanded\nthee. How dost thou then suppose that he will respect a sacrifice out of\nsuch things as he hath doomed to destruction? unless perhaps thou dost\nimagine that it is almost all one to offer it in sacrifice to God as to\ndestroy it. Do thou therefore expect that thy kingdom will be taken from\nthee, and that authority which thou hast abused by such insolent behavior,\nas to neglect that God who bestowed it upon thee.\" Then did Saul confess\nthat he had acted unjustly, and did not deny that he had sinned, because\nhe had transgressed the injunctions of the prophet; but he said that it\nwas out of a dread and fear of the soldiers, that he did not prohibit and\nrestrain them when they seized on the prey. \"But forgive me,\"\nsaid he, \"and be merciful to me, for I will be cautious how I offend\nfor the time to come.\" He also entreated the prophet to go back with\nhim, that he might offer his thank-offerings to God; but Samuel went home,\nbecause he saw that God would not be reconciled to him.", "But then Saul was so desirous to retain Samuel, that he took hold\nof his cloak, and because the vehemence of Samuel's departure made the\nmotion to be violent, the cloak was rent. Upon which the prophet said,\nthat after the same manner should the kingdom be rent from him, and that\na good and a just man should take it; that God persevered in what he had\ndecreed about him; that to be mutable and changeable in what is determined,\nis agreeable to human passions only, but is not agreeable to the Divine\nPower.

Samuel said, \"As thou hast made\nmany of the Hebrew mothers to lament and bewail the loss of their children,\nso shalt thou, by thy death, cause thy mother to lament thee also.\"\nAccordingly, he gave order to slay him immediately at Gilgal, and then\nwent away to the city Ramah.", {"emph": "hill", "#text": "NOW Saul being sensible of the miserable condition he had brought\nhimself into, and that he had made God to be his enemy, he went up to his\nroyal palace at Gibeah, which name denotes a , and after that\nday he came no more into the presence of the prophet. And when Samuel mourned\nfor him, God bid him leave off his concern for him, and to take the holy\noil, and go to Bethlehem, to Jesse the son of Obed, and to anoint such\nof his sons as he should show him for their future king. But Samuel said,\nhe was afraid lest Saul, when he came to know of it, should kill him, either\nby some private method or even openly. But upon God's suggesting to him\na safe way of going thither, he came to the forementioned city; and when\nthey all saluted him, and asked what was the occasion of his coming, he\ntold them he came to sacrifice to God. When, therefore, he had gotten the\nsacrifice ready, he called Jesse and his sons to partake of those sacrifices;\nand when he saw his eldest son to be a tall and handsome man, he guessed\nby his comeliness that he was the person who was to be their future king.\nBut he was mistaken in judging about God's providence; for when Samuel\ninquired of God whether he should anoint this youth, whom he so admired,\nand esteemed worthy of the kingdom, God said, \"Men do not see as God\nseeth. Thou indeed hast respect to the fine appearance of this youth, and\nthence esteemest him worthy of the kingdom, while I propose the kingdom\nas a reward, not of the beauty of bodies, but of the virtue of souls, and\nI inquire after one that is perfectly comely in that respect; I mean one\nwho is beautiful in piety, and righteousness, and fortitude, and obedience,\nfor in them consists the comeliness of the soul.\" When God had said\nthis, Samuel bade Jesse to show him all his sons. So he made five others\nof his sons to come to him; of all of whom Eliab was the eldest, Aminadab\nthe second, Shammall the third, Nathaniel the fourth, Rael the fifth, and\nAsam the sixth. And when the prophet saw that these were no way inferior\nto the eldest in their countenances, he inquired of God which of them it\nwas whom he chose for their king. And when God said it was none of them,\nhe asked Jesse whether he had not some other sons besides these; and when\nhe said that he had one more, named David, but that he was a shepherd,\nand took care of the flocks, Samuel bade them call him immediately, for\nthat till he was come they could not possibly sit down to the feast. Now,\nas soon as his father had sent for David, and he was come, he appeared\nto be of a yellow complexion, of a sharp sight, and a comely person in\nother respects also. This is he, said Samuel privately to himself, whom\nit pleases God to make our king. So he sat down to the feast, and placed\nthe youth under him, and Jesse also, with his other sons; after which he\ntook oil in the presence of David, and anointed him, and whispered him\nin the ear, and acquainted him that God chose him to be their king; and\nexhorted him to be righteous, and obedient to his commands, for that by\nthis means his kingdom would continue for a long time, and that his house\nshould be of great splendor, and celebrated in the world; that he should\noverthrow the Philistines; and that against what nations soever he should\nmake war, he should be the conqueror, and survive the fight; and that while\nhe lived he should enjoy a glorious name, and leave such a name to his\nposterity also."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Spanheim takes notice here that the Greeks had such singers of hymns; and\nthat usually children or youths were picked out for that service; as also,\nthat those called singers to the harp, did the same that David did here,\ni.e. join their own vocal and instrumental music together."}, "#text": "So Samuel, when he had given him these admonitions, went away. But\nthe Divine Power departed from Saul, and removed to David; who, upon this\nremoval of the Divine Spirit to him, began to prophesy. But as for Saul,\nsome strange and demoniacal disorders came upon him, and brought upon him\nsuch suffocations as were ready to choke him; for which the physicians\ncould find no other remedy but this, That if any person could charm those\npassions by singing, and playing upon the harp, they advised them to inquire\nfor such a one, and to observe when these demons came upon him and disturbed\nhim, and to take care that such a person might stand over him, and play\nupon the harp, and recite hymns to him. \nAccordingly Saul did not delay, but commanded them to seek out such a man.\nAnd when a certain stander-by said that he had seen in the city of Bethlehem\na son of Jesse, who was yet no more than a child in age, but comely and\nbeautiful, and in other respects one that was deserving of great regard,\nwho was skillful in playing on the harp, and in singing of hymns, [and\nan excellent soldier in war,] he sent to Jesse, and desired him to take\nDavid away from the flocks, and send him to him, for he had a mind to see\nhim, as having heard an advantageous character of his comeliness and his\nvalor. So Jesse sent his son, and gave him presents to carry to Saul. And\nwhen he was come, Saul was pleased with him, and made him his armor-bearer,\nand had him in very great esteem; for he charmed his passion, and was the\nonly physician against the trouble he had from the demons, whensoever it\nwas that it came upon him, and this by reciting of hymns, and playing upon\nthe harp, and bringing Saul to his right mind again. However, he sent to\nJesse, the father of the child, and desired him to permit David to stay\nwith him, for that he was delighted with his sight and company; which stay,\nthat he might not contradict Saul, he granted."}, "NOW the Philistines gathered themselves together again no very long\ntime afterward; and having gotten together a great army, they made war\nagainst the Israelites; and having seized a place between Shochoh and Azekah,\nthey there pitched their camp. Saul also drew out his army to oppose them;\nand by pitching his own camp on a certain hill, he forced the Philistines\nto leave their former camp, and to encamp themselves upon such another\nhill, over-against that on which Saul's army lay, so that a valley, which\nwas between the two hills on which they lay, divided their camps asunder.\nNow there came down a man out of the camp of the Philistines, whose name\nwas Goliath, of the city of Gath, a man of vast bulk, for he was of four\ncubits and a span in tallness, and had about him weapons suitable to the\nlargeness of his body, for he had a breastplate on that weighed five thousand\nshekels: he had also a helmet and greaves of brass, as large as you would\nnaturally suppose might cover the limbs of so vast a body. His spear was\nalso such as was not carried like a light thing in his right hand, but\nhe carried it as lying on his shoulders. He had also a lance of six hundred\nshekels; and many followed him to carry his armor. Wherefore this Goliath\nstood between the two armies, as they were in battle array, and sent out\naloud voice, and said to Saul and the Hebrews, \"I will free you from\nfighting and from dangers; for what necessity is there that your army should\nfall and be afflicted? Give me a man of you that will fight with me, and\nhe that conquers shall have the reward of the conqueror and determine the\nwar; for these shall serve those others to whom the conqueror shall belong;\nand certainly it is much better, and more prudent, to gain what you desire\nby the hazard of one man than of all.\" When he had said this, he retired\nto his own camp; but the next day he came again, and used the same words,\nand did not leave off for forty days together, to challenge the enemy in\nthe same words, till Saul and his army were therewith terrified, while\nthey put themselves in array as if they would fight, but did not come to\na close battle.", "Now while this war between the Hebrews and the Philistines was going\non, Saul sent away David to his father Jesse, and contented himself with\nthose three sons of his whom he had sent to his assistance, and to be partners\nin the dangers of the war: and at first David returned to feed his sheep\nand his flocks; but after no long time he came to the camp of the Hebrews,\nas sent by his father, to carry provisions to his brethren, and to know\nwhat they were doing. While Goliath came again, and challenged them, and\nreproached them, that they had no man of valor among them that durst come\ndown to fight him; and as David was talking with his brethren about the\nbusiness for which his father had sent him, he heard the Philistine reproaching\nand abusing the army, and had indignation at it, and said to his brethren,\n\"I am ready to fight a single combat with this adversary.\" Whereupon\nEliab, his eldest brother, reproved him, and said that he spoke too rashly\nand improperly for one of his age, and bid him go to his flocks, and to\nhis father. So he was abashed at his brother's words, and went away, but\nstill he spake to some of the soldiers that he was willing to fight with\nhim that challenged them. And when they had informed Saul what was the\nresolution of the young man, the king sent for him to come to him: and\nwhen the king asked what he had to say, he replied, \"O king, be not\ncast down, nor afraid, for I will depress the insolence of this adversary,\nand will go down and fight with him, and will bring him under me, as tall\nand as great as he is, till he shall be sufficiently laughed at, and thy\narmy shall get great glory, when he shall be slain by one that is not yet\nof man's estate, neither fit for fighting, nor capable of being intrusted\nwith the marshalling an army, or ordering a battle, but by one that looks\nlike a child, and is really no elder in age than a child.\"", "Now Saul wondered at the boldness and alacrity of David, but durst\nnot presume on his ability, by reason of his age; but said he must on that\naccount be too weak to fight with one that was skilled in the art of war.\n\"I undertake this enterprise,\" said David, \"in dependence\non God's being with me, for I have had experience already of his assistance;\nfor I once pursued after and caught a lion that assaulted my flocks, and\ntook away a lamb from them; and I snatched the lamb out of the wild beast's\nmouth, and when he leaped upon me with violence, I took him by the tail,\nand dashed him against the ground. In the same manner did I avenge myself\non a bear also; and let this adversary of ours be esteemed like one of\nthese wild beasts, since he has a long while reproached our army, and blasphemed\nour God, who yet will reduce him under my power.\"", "However, Saul prayed that the end might be, by God's assistance,\nnot disagreeable to the alacrity and boldness of the child; and said, \"Go\nthy way to the fight.\" So he put about him his breastplate, and girded\non his sword, and fitted the helmet to his head, and sent him away. But\nDavid was burdened with his armor, for he had not been exercised to it,\nnor had he learned to walk with it; so he said, \"Let this armor be\nthine, O king, who art able to bear it; but give me leave to fight as thy\nservant, and as I myself desire.\" Accordingly he laid by the armor,\nand taking his staff with him, and putting five stones out of the brook\ninto a shepherd's bag, and having a sling in his right hand, he went towards\nGoliath. But the adversary seeing him come in such a manner, disdained\nhim, and jested upon him, as if he had not such weapons with him as are\nusual when one man fights against another, but such as are used in driving\naway and avoiding of dogs; and said, \"Dost thou take me not for a\nman, but a dog?\" To which he replied, \"No, not for a dog, but\nfor a creature worse than a dog.\" This provoked Goliath to anger,\nwho thereupon cursed him by the name of God, and threatened to give his\nflesh to the beasts of the earth, and to the fowls of the air, to be torn\nin pieces by them. To whom David answered, \"Thou comest to me with a sword,\nand with a spear, and with a breastplate; but I have God for my armor in\ncoming against thee, who will destroy thee and all thy army by my hands\nfor I will this day cut off thy head, and cast the other parts of thy body\nto the dogs, and all men shall learn that God is the protector of the Hebrews,\nand that our armor and our strength is in his providence; and that without\nGod's assistance, all other warlike preparations and power are useless.\"\nSo the Philistine being retarded by the weight of his armor, when he attempted\nto meet David in haste, came on but slowly, as despising him, and depending\nupon it that he should slay him, who was both unarmed and a child also,\nwithout any trouble at all.", "But the youth met his antagonist, being accompanied with an invisible\nassistant, who was no other than God himself. And taking one of the stones\nthat he had out of the brook, and had put into his shepherd's bag, and\nfitting it to his sling, he slang it against the Philistine. This stone\nfell upon his forehead, and sank into his brain, insomuch that Goliath\nwas stunned, and fell upon his face. So David ran, and stood upon his adversary\nas he lay down, and cut off his head with his own sword; for he had no\nsword himself. And upon the fall of Goliath the Philistines were beaten,\nand fled; for when they saw their champion prostrate on the ground, they\nwere afraid of the entire issue of their affairs, and resolved not to stay\nany longer, but committed themselves to an ignominious and indecent flight,\nand thereby endeavored to save themselves from the dangers they were in.\nBut Saul and the entire army of the Hebrews made a shout, and rushed upon\nthem, and slew a great number of them, and pursued the rest to the borders\nof Garb, and to the gates of Ekron; so that there were slain of the Philistines\nthirty thousand, and twice as many wounded. But Saul returned to their\ncamp, and pulled their fortification to pieces, and burnt it; but David\ncarried the head of Goliath into his own tent, but dedicated his sword\nto God [at the tabernacle].", "NOW the women were an occasion of Saul's envy and hatred to David;\nfor they came to meet their victorious army with cymbals, and drums, and\nall demonstrations of joy, and sang thus: The wives said, that \"Saul\nhad slain his many thousands of the Philistines.\" The virgins replied,\nthat \"David had slain his ten thousands.\" Now, when the king\nheard them singing thus, and that he had himself the smallest share in\ntheir commendations, and the greater number, the ten thousands, were ascribed\nto the young man; and when he considered with himself that there was nothing\nmore wanting to David, after such a mighty applause, but the kingdom; he\nbegan to be afraid and suspicious of David. Accordingly he removed him\nfrom the station he was in before, for he was his armor-bearer, which,\nout of fear, seemed to him much too near a station for him; and so he made\nhim captain over a thousand, and bestowed on him a post better indeed in\nitself, but, as he thought, more for his own security; for he had a mind\nto send him against the enemy, and into battles, as hoping he would be\nslain in such dangerous conflicts.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Josephus says thrice in this chapter, and twice afterwards, ch. 11. sect.\n2, and B.

The Septuagint have 100 foreskins, but the Syriac and Arabic\n200. Now that these were not foreskins, with our other copies, but heads,\nwith Josephus's copy, seems somewhat probable, from 1 Samuel 29:4, where\nall copies say that it was with the heads of such Philistines that David\nmight reconcile himself to his master, Saul."}, "#text": "But David had God going along with him whithersoever he went, and\naccordingly he greatly prospered in his undertakings, and it was visible\nthat he had mighty success, insomuch that Saul's daughter, who was still\na virgin, fell in love with him; and her affection so far prevailed over\nher, that it could not be concealed, and her father became acquainted with\nit. Now Saul heard this gladly, as intending to make use of it for a snare\nagainst David, and he hoped that it would prove the cause of destruction\nand of hazard to him; so he told those that informed him of his daughter's\naffection, that he would willingly give David the virgin in marriage, and\nsaid, \"I engage myself to marry my daughter to him if he will bring\nme six hundred heads of my enemies \nsupposing that when a reward so ample was proposed to him, and when he\nshould aim to get him great glory, by undertaking a thing so dangerous\nand incredible, he would immediately set about it, and so perish by the\nPhilistines; and my designs about him will succeed finely to my mind, for\nI shall be freed from him, and get him slain, not by myself, but by another\nman.\" So he gave order to his servants to try how David would relish\nthis proposal of marrying the damsel. Accordingly, they began to speak\nthus to him: That king Saul loved him, as well as did all the people, and\nthat he was desirous of his affinity by the marriage of this damsel. To\nwhich he gave this answer: - \"Seemeth it to you a light thing to be\nmade the king's son-in-law? It does not seem so to me, especially when\nI am one of a family that is low, and without any glory or honor.\"\nNow when Saul was informed by his servants what answer David had made,\nhe said, - \"Tell him that I do not want any money nor dowry from him,\nwhich would be rather to set my daughter to sale than to give her in marriage;\nbut I desire only such a son-in-law as hath in him fortitude, and all other\nkinds of virtue,\" of which he saw David was possessed, and that his\ndesire was to receive of him, on account of his marrying his daughter,\nneither gold nor silver, nor that he should bring such wealth out of his\nfather's house, but only some revenge on the Philistines, and indeed six\nhundred of their heads, than which a more desirable or a more glorious\npresent could not be brought him, and that he had much rather obtain this,\nthan any of the accustomed dowries for his daughter, viz. that she should\nbe married to a man of that character, and to one who had a testimony as\nhaving conquered his enemies."}, "When these words of Saul were brought to David, he was pleased with\nthem, and supposed that Saul was really desirous of this affinity with\nhim; so that without bearing to deliberate any longer, or casting about\nin his mind whether what was proposed was possible, or was difficult or\nnot, he and his companions immediately set upon the enemy, and went about\ndoing what was proposed as the condition of the marriage. Accordingly,\nbecause it was God who made all things easy and possible to David, he slew\nmany [of the Philistines], and cut off the heads of six hundred of them,\nand came to the king, and by showing him these heads of the Philistines,\nrequired that he might have his daughter in marriage. Accordingly, Saul\nhaving no way of getting off his engagements, as thinking it a base thing\neither to seem a liar when he promised him this marriage, or to appear\nto have acted treacherously by him, in putting him upon what was in a manner\nimpossible, in order to have him slain, he gave him his daughter in marriage:\nher name was Michal.", "HOWEVER, Saul was not disposed to persevere long in the state wherein\nhe was, for when he saw that David was in great esteem, both with God and\nwith the multitude, he was afraid; and being not able to conceal his fear\nas concerning great things, his kingdom and his life, to be deprived of\neither of which was a very great calamity, he resolved to have David slain,\nand commanded his son Jonathan and his most faithful servants to kill him:\nbut Jonathan wondered at his father's change with relation to David, that\nit should be made to so great a degree, from showing him no small good-will,\nto contrive how to have him killed. Now, because he loved the young man,\nand reverenced him for his virtue, he informed him of the secret charge\nhis father had given, and what his intentions were concerning him. However,\nhe advised him to take care and be absent the next day, for that he would\nsalute his father, and, if he met with a favorable opportunity, he would\ndiscourse with him about him, and learn the cause of his disgust, and show\nhow little ground there was for it, and that for it he ought not to kill\na man that had done so many good things to the multitude, and had been\na benefactor to himself, on account of which he ought in reason to obtain\npardon, had he been guilty of the greatest crimes; and \"I will then\ninform thee of my father's resolution.\" Accordingly David complied\nwith such an advantageous advice, and kept himself then out of the king's\nsight.", "On the next day Jonathan came to Saul, as soon as he saw him in a\ncheerful and joyful disposition, and began to introduce a discourse about\nDavid: \"What unjust action, O father, either little or great, hast\nthou found so exceptionable in David, as to induce thee to order us to\nslay a man who hath been of great advantage to thy own preservation, and\nof still greater to the punishment of the Philistines? A man who hath delivered\nthe people of the Hebrews from reproach and derision, which they underwent\nfor forty days together, when he alone had courage enough to sustain the\nchallenge of the adversary, and after that brought as many heads of our\nenemies as he was appointed to bring, and had, as a reward for the same,\nmy sister in marriage; insomuch that his death would be very sorrowful\nto us, not only on account of his virtue, but on account of the nearness\nof our relation; for thy daughter must be injured at the same time that\nhe is slain, and must be obliged to experience widowhood, before she can\ncome to enjoy any advantage from their mutual conversation. Consider these\nthings, and change your mind to a more merciful temper, and do no mischief\nto a man, who, in the first place, hath done us the greatest kindness of\npreserving thee; for when an evil spirit and demons had seized upon thee,\nhe cast them out, and procured rest to thy soul from their incursions:\nand, in the second place, hath avenged us of our enemies; for it is a base\nthing to forget such benefits.\" So Saul was pacified with these words,\nand sware to his son that he would do David no harm, for a righteous discourse\nproved too hard for the king's anger and fear. So Jonathan sent for David,\nand brought him good news from his father, that he was to be preserved.\nHe also brought him to his father; and David continued with the king as\nformerly.", "About this time it was that, upon the Philistines making a new expedition\nagainst the Hebrews, Saul sent David with an army to fight with them; and\njoining battle with them he slew many of them, and after his victory he\nreturned to the king. But his reception by Saul was not as he expected\nupon such success, for he was grieved at his prosperity, because he thought\nhe would be more dangerous to him by having acted so gloriously: but when\nthe demoniacal spirit came upon him, and put him into disorder, and disturbed\nhim, he called for David into his bed-chamber wherein he lay, and having\na spear in his hand, he ordered him to charm him with playing on his harp,\nand with singing hymns; which when David did at his command, he with great\nforce threw the spear at him; but David was aware of it before it came,\nand avoided it, and fled to his own house, and abode there all that day.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Since the modern Jews have lost the signification of the Hebrew word here\nused, cebr; and since the LXX., as well as Josephus, reader it the liver\nof the goat, and since this rendering, and Josephus's account, are here\nso much more clear and probable than those of others, it is almost unaccountable\nthat our commentators should so much as hesitate about its true interpretation."}, "#text": "But at night the king sent officers, and commanded that he should\nbe watched till the morning, lest he should get quite away, that he might\ncome into the judgment-hall, and so might be delivered up, and condemned\nand slain.

To which\nDavid replied, \"I am sensible that thou art willing to gratify me\nin every thing, and procure me what I desire. Now tomorrow is the new moon,\nand I was accustomed to sit down then with the king at supper: now, if\nit seem good to thee, I will go out of the city, and conceal myself privately\nthere; and if Saul inquire why I am absent, tell him that I am gone to\nmy own city Bethlehem, to keep a festival with my own tribe; and add this\nalso, that thou gavest me leave so to do. And if he say, as is usually\nsaid in the case of friends that are gone abroad, It is well that he went,\nthen assure thyself that no latent mischief or enmity may be feared at\nhis hand; but if he answer otherwise, that will be a sure sign that he\nhath some designs against me, Accordingly thou shalt inform me of thy father's\ninclinations; and that out of pity to my case and out of thy friendship\nfor me, as instances of which friendship thou hast vouchsafed to accept\nof the assurances of my love to thee, and to give the like assurances\nto me, that is, those of a master to his servant; but if thou discoverest\nany wickedness in me, do thou prevent thy father, and kill me thyself.\"", "But Jonathan heard these last words with indignation, and promised\nto do what he desired of him, and to inform him if his father's answers\nimplied any thing of a melancholy nature, and any enmity against him. And\nthat he might the more firmly depend upon him, he took him out into the\nopen field, into the pure air, and sware that he would neglect nothing\nthat might tend to the preservation of David; and he said, \"I appeal\nto that God, who, as thou seest, is diffused every where, and knoweth this\nintention of mine, before I explain it in words, as the witness of this\nmy covenant with thee, that I will not leave off to make frequent trims\nof the purpose of my father till I learn whether there be any lurking distemper\nin the most secret parts of his soul; and when I have learnt it, I will\nnot conceal it from thee, but will discover it to thee, whether he be gently\nor peevishly disposed; for this God himself knows, that I pray he may always\nbe with thee, for he is with thee now, and will not forsake thee, and will\nmake thee superior to thine enemies, whether my father be one of them,\nor whether I myself be such. Do thou only remember what we now do; and\nif it fall out that I die, preserve my children alive, and requite what\nkindness thou hast now received to them.\" When he had thus sworn,\nhe dismissed David, bidding him go to a certain place of that plain wherein\nhe used to perform his exercises; for that, as soon as he knew the mind\nof his father, he would come thither to him, with one servant only; \"and\nif,\" says he, \"I shoot three darts at the mark, and then\nbid my servant to carry these three darts away, for they are before him,\nknow thou that there is no mischief to be feared from my father; but if\nthou hearest me say the contrary, expect the contrary from the king. However,\nthou shalt gain security by my means, and shalt by no means suffer any\nharm; but see thou dost not forget what I have desired of thee in the time\nof thy prosperity, and be serviceable to my children.\" Now David,\nwhen he had received these assurances from Jonathan, went his way to the\nplace appointed.", "But on the next day, which was the new moon, the king, when he had\npurified himself, as the custom was, came to supper; and when there sat\nby him his son Jonathan on his right hand, and Abner, the captain of his\nhost, on the other hand, he saw David's seat was empty, but said nothing,\nsupposing that he had not purified himself since he had accompanied with\nhis wife, and so could not be present; but when he saw that he was not\nthere the second day of the month neither, he inquired of his son Jonathan\nwhy the son of Jesse did not come to the supper and the feast, neither\nthe day before nor that day. So Jonathan said, That he was gone, according\nto the agreement between them, to his own city, where his tribe kept a\nfestival, and that by his permission: that he also invited him to come\nto their sacrifice; \"and,\" says Jonathan, \"if thou wilt\ngive me leave, I Will go thither, for thou knowest the good-will that I\nbear him.\" And then it was that Jonathan understood his father's hatred\nto David, and plainly saw his entire disposition; for Saul could not restrain\nhis anger, but reproached Jonathan, and called him the son of a runagate,\nand an enemy; and said he was a partner with David, and his assistant,\nand that by his behavior he showed he had no regard to himself, or to his\nmother, and would not be persuaded of this, - that while David is alive,\ntheir kingdom was not secure to them; yet did he bid him send for him,\nthat he might be punished. And when Jonathan said, in answer, \"What\nhath he done that thou wilt punish him?\" Saul no longer contented\nhimself to express his anger in bare words, but snatched up his spear,\nand leaped upon him, and was desirous to kill him. He did not indeed do\nwhat he intended, because he was hindered by his friends; but it appeared\nplainly to his son that he hated David, and greatly desired to despatch\nhim, insomuch that he had almost slain his son with his own hands on his\naccount.", "And then it was that the king's son rose hastily from supper; and\nbeing unable to admit any thing into his mouth for grief, he wept all night,\nboth because he had himself been near destruction, and because the death\nof David was determined: but as soon as it was day, he went out into the\nplain that was before the city, as going to perform his exercises, but\nin reality to inform his friend what disposition his father was in towards\nhim, as he had agreed with him to do; and when Jonathan had done what had\nbeen thus agreed, he dismissed his servant that followed him, to return\nto the city; but he himself went into the desert, and came into his presence,\nand communed with him. So David appeared and fell at Jonathan's feet, and\nbowed down to him, and called him the preserver of his soul; but he lifted\nhim up from the earth, and they mutually embraced one another, and made\na long greeting, and that not without tears. They also lamented their age,\nand that familiarity which envy would deprive them of, and that separation\nwhich must now be expected, which seemed to them no better than death itself.\nSo recollecting themselves at length from their lamentation, and exhorting\none another to be mindful of the oaths they had sworn to each other, they\nparted asunder.", "BUT David fled from the king, and that death he was in danger of\nby him, and came to the city Nob, to Ahimelech the priest, who, when he\nsaw him coming all alone, and neither a friend nor a servant with him,\nhe wondered at it, and desired to learn of him the cause why there was\nnobody with him. To which David answered, That the king had commanded him\nto do a certain thing that was to be kept secret, to which, if he had a\nmind to know so much, he had no occasion for any one to accompany him;\n\"however, I have ordered my servants to meet me at such and such a\nplace.\" So he desired him to let him have somewhat to eat; and that\nin case he would supply him, be would act the part of a friend, and be\nassisting to the business he was now about: and when he had obtained what\nhe desired, he also asked him whether he had any weapons with him, either\nsword or spear. Now there was at Nob a servant of Saul, by birth a Syrian,\nwhose name was Doeg, one that kept the king's mules. The high priest said\nthat he had no such weapons; but, he added, \"Here is the sword of\nGoliath, which, when thou hadst slain the Philistine, thou didst dedicate\nto God.\"", "When David had received the sword, he fled out of the country of\nthe Hebrews into that of the Philistines, over which Achish reigned; and\nwhen the king's servants knew him, and he was made known to the king himself,\nthe servants informing him that he was that David who had killed many ten\nthousands of the Philistines, David was afraid lest the king should put\nhim to death, and that he should experience that danger from him which\nhe had escaped from Saul; so he pretended to be distracted and mad, so\nthat his spittle ran out of his mouth; and he did other the like actions\nbefore the king of Gath, which might make him believe that they proceeded\nfrom such a distemper. Accordingly the king was very angry at his servants\nthat they had brought him a madman, and he gave orders that they should\neject David immediately [out of the city].", "So when David had escaped in this manner out of Gath, he came to\nthe tribe of Judah, and abode in a cave by the city of Adullam. Then it\nwas that he sent to his brethren, and informed them where he was, who then\ncame to him with all their kindred, and as many others as were either in\nwant or in fear of king Saul, came and made a body together, and told him\nthey were ready to obey his orders; they were in all about four hundred.\nWhereupon he took courage, now such a force and assistance was come to\nhim; so he removed thence and came to the king of the Moabites, and desired\nhim to entertain his parents in his country, while the issue of his affairs\nwere in such an uncertain condition. The king granted him this favor, and\npaid great respect to David's parents all the time they were with him.", "As for himself, upon the prophet's commanding him to leave the desert,\nand to go into the portion of the tribe of Judah, and abide there, he complied\ntherewith; and coming to the city Hareth, which was in that tribe, he remained\nthere. Now when Saul heard that David had been seen with a multitude about\nhim, he fell into no small disturbance and trouble; but as he knew that\nDavid was a bold and courageous man, he suspected that somewhat extraordinary\nwould appear from him, and that openly also, which would make him weep\nand put him into distress; so he called together to him his friends, and\nhis commanders, and the tribe from which he was himself derived, to the\nhill where his palace was; and sitting upon a place called Aroura, his\ncourtiers that were in dignities, and the guards of his body, being with\nhim, he spake thus to them: - \"You that are men of my own tribe, I\nconclude that you remember the benefits that I have bestowed upon you,\nand that I have made some of you owners of land, and made you commanders,\nand bestowed posts of honor upon you, and set some of you over the common\npeople, and others over the soldiers; I ask you, therefore, whether you\nexpect greater and more donations from the son of Jesse? for I know that\nyou are all inclinable to him; (even my own son Jonathan himself is of\nthat opinion, and persuades you to be of the same); for I am not unacquainted\nwith the oaths and the covenants that are between him and David, and that\nJonathan is a counselor and an assistant to those that conspire against\nme, and none of you are concerned about these things, but you keep silence\nand watch, to see what will be the upshot of these things.\" When the\nking had made this speech, not one of the rest of those that were present\nmade any answer; but Doeg the Syrian, who fed his mules, said, that he\nsaw David when he came to the city Nob to Ahimelech the high priest, and\nthat he learned future events by his prophesying; that he received food\nfrom him, and the sword of Goliath, and was conducted by him with security\nto such as he desired to go to.", "Saul therefore sent for the high priest, and for all his kindred;\nand said to them, \"What terrible or ungrateful tiring hast thou suffered\nfrom me, that thou hast received the son of Jesse, and hast bestowed on\nhim both food and weapons, when he was contriving to get the kingdom? And\nfurther, why didst thou deliver oracles to him concerning futurities? For\nthou couldst not be unacquainted that he was fled away from me, and that\nhe hated my family.\" But the high priest did not betake himself to\ndeny what he had done, but confessed boldly that he had supplied him with\nthese things, not to gratify David, but Saul himself: and he said, \"I\ndid not know that he was thy adversary, but a servant of thine, who was\nvery faithful to thee, and a captain over a thousand of thy soldiers, and,\nwhat is more than these, thy son-in-law, and kinsman. Men do not choose\nto confer such favors on their adversaries, but on those who are esteemed\nto bear the highest good-will and respect to them. Nor is this the first\ntime that I prophesied for him, but I have done it often, and at other\ntimes as well as now. And when he told me that he was sent by thee in great\nhaste to do somewhat, if I had furnished him with nothing that he desired\nI should have thought that it was rather in contradiction to thee than\nto him; wherefore do not thou entertain any ill opinion of me, nor do thou\nhave a suspicion of what I then thought an act of humanity, from what is\nnow told thee of David's attempts against thee, for I did then to him as\nto thy friend and son-in-law, and captain of a thousand, and not as to\nthine adversary.\"", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This city Nob was not a city allotted to the priests, nor had the prophets,\nthat we know of, any particular cities allotted them.

They also\npunish men for their actions, not such as deserve condemnation, but from\ncalumnies and accusations without examination; and this extends not only\nto such as deserve to be punished, but to as many as they are able to kill.\nThis reflection is openly confirmed to us from the example of Saul, the\nson of Kish, who was the first king who reigned after our aristocracy and\ngovernment under the judges were over; and that by his slaughter of three\nhundred priests and prophets, on occasion of his suspicion about Ahimelech,\nand by the additional wickedness of the overthrow of their city, and this\nis as he were endeavoring in some sort to render the temple [tabernacle]\ndestitute both of priests and prophets, which endeavor he showed by slaying\nso many of them, and not suffering the very city belonging to .them to\nremain, that so others might succeed them."}, "But Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, who alone could be saved out\nof the family of priests slain by Saul, fled to David, and informed him\nof the calamity that had befallen their family, and of the slaughter of\nhis father; who hereupon said, He was not unapprised of what would follow\nwith relation to them when he saw Doeg there; for he had then a suspicion\nthat the high priest would be falsely accused by him to the king, and he\nblamed himself as having been the cause of this misfortune.

So Jonathan left\nhim there, having rendered his cares and fears somewhat lighter, and returned\nhome. Now the men of Ziph, to gratify Saul, informed him that David abode\nwith them, and [assured him] that if he would come to them, they would\ndeliver him up, for that if the king would seize on the Straits of Ziph,\nDavid would not escape to any other people. So the king commended them,\nand confessed that he had reason to thank them, because they had given\nhim information of his enemy; and he promised them, that it should not\nbe long ere he would requite their kindness. He also sent men to seek for\nDavid, and to search the wilderness wherein he was; and he promised that\nhe himself would follow them. Accordingly they went before the king, to\nhunt for and to catch David, and used endeavors, not only to show their\ngood-will to Saul, by informing him where his enemy was, but to evidence\nthe same more plainly by delivering him up into his power. But these men\nfailed of those their unjust and wicked desires, who, while they underwent\nno hazard by not discovering such an ambition of revealing this to Saul,\nyet did they falsely accuse and promise to deliver up a man beloved of\nGod, and one that was unjustly sought after to be put to death, and one\nthat might otherwise have lain concealed, and this out of flattery, and\nexpectation of gain from the king; for when David was apprized of the malignant\nintentions of the men of Ziph, and the approach of Saul, he left the Straits\nof that country, and fled to the great rock that was in the wilderness\nof Maon.", "Hereupon Saul made haste to pursue him thither; for, as he was marching,\nhe learned that David was gone away from the Straits of Ziph, and Saul\nremoved to the other side of the rock.

When the messengers\nhad carried this message to Nabal, he accosted them after an inhuman and\nrough manner; for he asked them who David was? and when he heard that he\nwas the son of Jesse, he said, \"Now is the time that fugitives grow\ninsolent, and make a figure, and leave their masters.\" When they told\nDavid this, he was wroth, and commanded four hundred armed men to follow\nhim, and left two hundred to take care of the stuff, (for he had already\nsix hundred, )\nand went against Nabal: he also swore that he would that night utterly\ndestroy the whole house and possessions of Nabal; for that he was grieved,\nnot only that he had proved ungrateful to them, without making any return\nfor the humanity they had shown him, but that he had also reproached them,\nand used ill language to them, when he had received no cause of disgust\nfrom them."}, {"emph": "folly", "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "In this and the two next sections, we may perceive how Josephus, nay, how\nAbigail herself, would understand, the \"not avenging ourselves, but\nheaping coals of fire on the head of the injurious,\" Proverbs 25:22;\nRomans 12:20, not as we do now, of them into but of leaving them to the\njudgment of God, \"to whom vengeance belongeth,\" Deuteronomy 32:35;\nPsalms 94:1; Hebrews 10:30, and who will take vengeance on the wicked.\nAnd since all God's judgments are just, and all fit to be executed, and\nall at length for the good of the persons punished, I incline to think\nthat to be the meaning of this phrase of \"heaping coals of fire on\ntheir heads.\""}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "We may note here, that how sacred soever an oath was esteemed among the\npeople of God in old times, they did not think it obligatory where the\naction was plainly unlawful.

When the servant had said this, Abigail, for\nthat was his wife's name, saddled her asses, and loaded them with all sorts\nof presents; and, without telling her husband any thing of what she was\nabout, (for he was not sensible on account of his drunkenness,) she went\nto David. She was then met by David as she was descending a hill, who was\ncoming against Nabal with four hundred men. When the woman saw David, she\nleaped down from her ass, and fell on her face, and bowed down to the ground;\nand entreated him not to bear in mind the words of Nabal, since he knew\nthat he resembled his name. Now Nabal, in the Hebrew tongue, signifies. So she made her apology, that she did not see the messengers\nwhom he sent. \"Forgive me, therefore,\" said she, \"and thank\nGod, who hath hindered thee from shedding human blood; for so long as thou\nkeepest thyself innocent, he will avenge thee of wicked men, \nfor what miseries await Nabal, they will fall upon the heads of thine enemies.\nBe thou gracious to me, and think me so far worthy as to accept of these\npresents from me; and, out of regard to me, remit that wrath and that anger\nwhich thou hast against my husband and his house, for mildness and humanity\nbecome thee, especially as thou art to be our king.\" Accordingly,\nDavid accepted her presents, and said, \"Nay, but, O woman, it was\nno other than God's mercy which brought thee to us today, for, otherwise,\nthou hadst never seen another day, I having sworn \nto destroy Nabal's house this very night, and to leave alive not one of\nyou who belonged to a man that was wicked and ungrateful to me and my companions;\nbut now hast thou prevented me, and seasonably mollified my anger, as being\nthyself under the care of God's providence: but as for Nabal, although\nfor thy sake he now escape punishment, he will not always avoid justice;\nfor his evil conduct, on some other occasion, will be his ruin.\""}, "When David had said this, he dismissed the woman. But when she came\nhome and found her husband feasting with a great company, and oppressed\nwith wine, she said nothing to him then about what had happened; but on\nthe next day, when he was sober, she told him all the particulars, and\nmade his whole body to appear like that of a dead man by her words, and\nby that grief which arose from them; so Nabal survived ten days, and no\nmore, and then died. And when David heard of his death, he said that God\nhad justly avenged him of this man, for that Nabal had died by his own\nwickedness, and had suffered punishment on his account, while he had kept\nhis own hands clean. At which time he understood that the wicked are prosecuted\nby God; that he does not overlook any man, but bestows on the good what\nis suitable to them, and inflicts a deserved punishment on the wicked.\nSo he sent to Nabal's wife, and invited her to come to him, to live with\nhim, and to be his wife. Whereupon she replied to those that came, that\nshe was not worthy to touch his feet; however, she came, with all her servants,\nand became his wife, having received that honor on account of her wise\nand righteous course of life. She also obtained the same honor partly on\naccount of her beauty. Now David had a wife before, whom he married from\nthe city Abesar; for as to Michal, the daughter of king Saul, who had been\nDavid's wife, her father had given her in marriage to Phalti, the son of\nLaish, who was of the city of Gallim.", "After this came certain of the Ziphites, and told Saul that David\nwas come again into their country, and if he would afford them his assistance,\nthey could catch him. So he came to them with three thousand armed men;\nand upon the approach of night, he pitched his camp at a certain place\ncalled Hachilah. But when David heard that Saul was coming against him,\nhe sent spies, and bid them let him know to what place of the country Saul\nwas already come; and when they told him that he was at Hachilah, he concealed\nhis going away from his companions, and came to Saul's camp, having taken\nwith him Abishai, his sister Zeruiah's son, and Ahimelech the Hittite.\nNow Saul was asleep, and the armed men, with Abner their commander, lay\nround about him in a circle. Hereupon David entered into the king's tent;\nbut he did neither kill Saul, though he knew where he lay, by the spear\nthat was stuck down by him, nor did he give leave to Abishai, who would\nhave killed him, and was earnestly bent upon it so to do; for he said it\nwas a horrid crime to kill one that was ordained king by God, although\nhe was a wicked man; for that he who gave him the dominion would in time\ninflict punishment upon him. So he restrained his eagerness; but that it\nmight appear to have been in his power to have killed him when he refrained\nfrom it, he took his spear, and the cruse of water which stood by Saul\nas he lay asleep, without being perceived by any in the camp, who were\nall asleep, and went securely away, having performed every thing among\nthe king's attendants that the opportunity afforded, and his boldness encouraged\nhim to do. So when he had passed over a brook, and was gotten up to the\ntop of a hill, whence he might be sufficiently heard, he cried aloud to\nSaul's soldiers, and to Abner their commander, and awaked them out of their\nsleep, and called both to him and to the people. Hereupon the commander\nheard him, and asked who it was that called him. To whom David replied,\n\"It is I, the son of Jesse, whom you make a vagabond. But what is\nthe matter? Dost thou, that art a man of so great dignity, and of the first\nrank in the king's court, take so little care of thy master's body? and\nis sleep of more consequence to thee than his preservation, and thy care\nof him? This negligence of yours deserves death, and punishment to be inflicted\non you, who never perceived when, a little while ago, some of us entered\ninto your camp, nay, as far as to the king himself, and to all the rest\nof you. If thou look for the king's spear and his cruse of water, thou\nwilt learn what a mighty misfortune was ready to overtake you in your very\ncamp without your knowing it.\" Now when Saul knew David's voice, and\nunderstood that when he had him in his power while he was asleep, and his\nguards took no care of him, yet did not he kill him, but spared him, when\nhe might justly have cut him off, he said that he owed him thanks for his\npreservation; and exhorted him to be of good courage, and not be afraid\nof suffering any mischief from him any more, and to return to his own home,\nfor he was now persuaded that he did not love himself so well as he was\nloved by him: that he had driven away him that could guard him, and had\ngiven many demonstrations of his good-will to him: that he had forced him\nto live so long in a state of banishment, and in great fears of his life,\ndestitute of his friends and his kindred, while still he was often saved\nby him, and frequently received his life again when it was evidently in\ndanger of perishing. So David bade them send for the spear and the cruse\nof water, and take them back; adding this withal, That God would be the\njudge of both their dispositions, and of the actions that flowed from the\nsame, \"who knows that then it was this day in my power to have killed\nthee I abstained from it.\"", "Thus Saul having escaped the hands of David twice, he went his way\nto his royal palace, and his own city: but David was afraid, that if he\nstaid there he should be caught by Saul; so he thought it better to go\nup into the land of the Philistines, and abide there. Accordingly, he came\nwith the six hundred men that were with him to Achish, the king of Gath,\nwhich was one of their five cities. Now the king received both him and\nhis men, and gave them a place to inhabit in. He had with him also his\ntwo wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, and he dwelt in Gath. But when Saul heard\nthis, he took no further care about sending to him, or going after him,\nbecause he had been twice, in a manner, caught by him, while he was himself\nendeavoring to catch him. However, David had no mind to continue in the\ncity of Gath, but desired the king, that since he had received him with\nsuch humanity, that he would grant him another favor, and bestow upon him\nsome place of that country for his habitation, for he was ashamed, by living\nin the city, to be grievous and burdensome to him. So Achish gave him a\ncertain village called Ziklag; which place David and his sons were fond\nof when he was king, and reckoned it to be their peculiar inheritance.\nBut about those matters we shall give the reader further information elsewhere.\nNow the time that David dwelt in Ziklag, in the land of the Philistines,\nwas four months and twenty days. And now he privately attacked those Geshurites\nand Amalekites that were neighbors to the Philistines, and laid waste their\ncountry, and took much prey of their beasts and camels, and then returned\nhome; but David abstained from the men, as fearing they should discover\nhim to king Achish; yet did he send part of the prey to him as a free gift.\nAnd when the king inquired whom they had attacked when they brought away\nthe prey, he said, those that lay to the south of the Jews, and inhabited\nin the plain; whereby he persuaded Achish to approve of what he had done,\nfor he hoped that David had fought against his own nation, and that now\nhe should have him for his servant all his life long, and that he would\nstay in his country.", "ABOUT the same time the Philistines resolved to make war against\nthe Israelites, and sent to all their confederates that they would go along\nwith them to the war to Reggan, [near the city Shunem,] whence they might\ngather themselves together, and suddenly attack the Hebrews. Then did Achish,\nthe king of Gath, desire David to assist them with his armed men against\nthe Hebrews. This he readily promised; and said that the time was now come\nwherein he might requite him for his kindness and hospitality. So the king\npromised to make him the keeper of his body, after the victory, supposing\nthat the battle with the enemy succeeded to their mind; which promise of\nhonor and confidence he made on purpose to increase his zeal for his service.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This history of Saul's consultation, not with a witch, as we render the\nHebrew word here, but with a necromancer, as the whole history shows, is\neasily understood, especially if we consult the Recognitions of Clement,\nB.

But when he heard that the Philistines were\nalready come, and had pitched their camp near the city Shunem, situate\nin the plain, he made haste to oppose them with his forces; and when he\nwas come to a certain mountain called Gilboa, he pitched his camp over-against\nthe enemy; but when he saw the enemy's army he was greatly troubled, because\nit appeared to him to be numerous, and superior to his own; and he inquired\nof God by the prophets concerning the battle, that he might know beforehand\nwhat would be the event of it. And when God did not answer him, Saul was\nunder a still greater dread, and his courage fell, foreseeing, as was but\nreasonable to suppose, that mischief would befall him, now God was not\nthere to assist him; yet did he bid his servants to inquire out for him\nsome woman that was a necromancer and called up the souls of the dead,\nthat So he might know whether his affairs would succeed to his mind; for\nthis sort of necromantic women that bring up the souls of the dead, do\nby them foretell future events to such as desire them. And one of his servants\ntold him that there was such a woman in the city Endor, but was known to\nnobody in the camp; hereupon Saul put off his royal apparel, and took two\nof those his servants with him, whom he knew to be most faithful to him,\nand came to Endor to the woman, and entreated her to act the part of a\nfortune-teller, and to bring up such a soul to him as he should name to\nher. But when the woman opposed his motion, and said she did not despise\nthe king, who had banished this sort of fortune-tellers, and that he did\nnot do well himself, when she had done him no harm, to endeavor to lay\na snare for her, and to discover that she exercised a forbidden art, in\norder to procure her to be punished, he sware that nobody should know what\nshe did; and that he would not tell any one else what she foretold, but\nthat she should incur no danger. As soon as he had induced her by\nthis oath to fear no harm, he bid her bring up to him the soul of Samuel.\nShe, not knowing who Samuel was, called him out of Hades. When he appeared,\nand the woman saw one that was venerable, and of a divine form, she was\nin disorder; and being astonished at the sight, she said, \"Art not\nthou king Saul?\" for Samuel had informed her who he was. When he had\nowned that to be true, and had asked her whence her disorder arose, she\nsaid that she saw a certain person ascend, who in his form was like to\na god. And when he bid her tell him what he resembled, in what habit he\nappeared, and of what age he was, she told him he was an old man already,\nand of a glorious personage, and had on a sacerdotal mantle. So the king\ndiscovered by these signs that he was Samuel; and he fell down upon the\nground, and saluted and worshipped him. And when the soul of Samuel asked\nhim why he had disturbed him, and caused him to be brought up, he lamented\nthe necessity he was under; for he said, that his enemies pressed heavily\nupon him; that he was in distress what to do in his present circumstances;\nthat he was forsaken of God, and could obtain no prediction of what was\ncoming, neither by prophets nor by dreams; and that \"these were the\nreasons why I have recourse to thee, who always took great care of me.\"\nBut \nSamuel, seeing that the end of Saul's life was come, said, \"It is\nin vain for thee to desire to learn of me any thing future, when God hath\nforsaken thee: however, hear what I say, that David is to be king, and\nto finish this war with good success; and thou art to lose thy dominion\nand thy life, because thou didst not obey God in the war with the Amalekites,\nand hast not kept his commandments, as I foretold thee while I was alive.\nKnow, therefore, that the people shall be made subject to their enemies,\nand that thou, with thy sons, shall fall in the battle tomorrow, and thou\nshalt then be with me [in Hades].\""}, "When Saul heard this, he could not speak for grief, and fell down\non the floor, whether it were from the sorrow that arose upon what Samuel\nhad said, or from his emptiness, for he had taken no food the foregoing\nday nor night, he easily fell quite down: and when with difficulty he had\nrecovered himself, the woman would force him to eat, begging this of him\nas a favor on account of her concern in that dangerous instance of fortune-telling,\nwhich it was not lawful for her to have done, because of the fear she was\nunder of the king, while she knew not who he was, yet did she undertake\nit, and go through with it; on which account she entreated him to admit\nthat a table and food might be set before him, that he might recover his\nstrength, and so get safe to his own camp. And when he opposed her motion,\nand entirely rejected it, by reason of his anxiety, she forced him, and\nat last persuaded him to it. Now she had one calf that she was very fond\nof, and one that she took a great deal of care of, and fed it herself;\nfor she was a woman that got her living by the labor of her own hands,\nand had no other possession but that one calf; this she killed, and made\nready its flesh, and set it before his servants and himself.

It would be well therefore to imitate the example\nand to do kindnesses to all such as are in want and to think that nothing\nis better, nor more becoming mankind, than such a general beneficence,\nnor what will sooner render God favorable, and ready to bestow good things\nupon us. And so far may suffice to have spoken concerning this woman. But\nI shall speak further upon another subject, which will afford me all opportunity\nof discoursing on what is for the advantage of cities, and people, and\nnations, and suited to the taste of good men, and will encourage them all\nin the prosecution of virtue; and is capable of showing them the of acquiring\nglory, and an everlasting fame; and of imprinting in the kings of nations,\nand the rulers of cities, great inclination and diligence of doing well;\nas also of encouraging them to undergo dangers, and to die for their countries,\nand of instructing them how to despise all the most terrible adversities:\nand I have a fair occasion offered me to enter on such a discourse by Saul\nthe king of the Hebrews; for although he knew what was coming upon him,\nand that he was to die immediately, by the prediction of the prophet, he\ndid not resolve to fly from death, nor so far to indulge the love of life\nas to betray his own people to the enemy, or to bring a disgrace on his\nroyal dignity; but exposing himself, as well as all his family and children,\nto dangers, he thought it a brave thing to fall together with them, as\nhe was fighting for his subjects, and that it was better his sons should\ndie thus, showing their courage, than to leave them to their uncertain\nconduct afterward, while, instead of succession and posterity, they gained\ncommendation and a lasting name. Such a one alone seems to me to be a just,\na courageous, and a prudent man; and when any one has arrived at these\ndispositions, or shall hereafter arrive at them, he is the man that ought\nto be by all honored with the testimony of a virtuous or courageous man:\nfor as to those that go out to war with hopes of success, and that they\nshall return safe, supposing they should have performed some glorious action,\nI think those do not do well who call these valiant men, as so many historians\nand other writers who treat of them are wont to do, although I confess\nthose do justly deserve some commendation also; but those only may be styled\ncourageous and bold in great undertakings, and despisers of adversities,\nwho imitate Saul: for as for those that do not know what the event of war\nwill be as to themselves, and though they do not faint in it, but deliver\nthemselves up to uncertain futurity, and are tossed this way and that way,\nthis is not so very eminent an instance of a generous mind, although they\nhappen to perform many great exploits; but when men's minds expect no good\nevent, but they know beforehand they must die, and that they must undergo\nthat death in the battle also, after this neither to be aftrighted, nor\nto be astonished at the terrible fate that is coming, but to go directly\nupon it, when they know it beforehand, this it is that I esteem the character\nof a man truly courageous. Accordingly this Saul did, and thereby demonstrated\nthat all men who desire fame after they are dead are so to act as they\nmay obtain the same: this especially concerns kings, who ought not to think\nit enough in their high stations that they are not wicked in the government\nof their subjects, but to be no more than moderately good to them. I could\nsay more than this about Saul and his courage, the subject affording matter\nsufficient; but that I may not appear to run out improperly in his commendation,\nI return again to that history from which I made this digression."}, {"emph": "\"", "#text": "Now when the Philistines, as I said before, had pitched their camp,\nand had taken an account of their forces, according to their nations, and\nkingdoms, and governments, king Achish came last of all with his own army;\nafter whom came David with his six hundred armed men. And when the commanders\nof the Philistines saw him, they asked the king whence these Hebrews came,\nand at whose invitation. He answered that it was David, who was fled away\nfrom his master Saul, and that he had entertained him when he came to him,\nand that now he was willing to make him this requital for his favors, and\nto avenge himself upon Saul, and so was become his confederate. The commanders\ncomplained of this, that he had taken him for a confederate who was an\nenemy; and gave him counsel to send him away, lest he should unawares do\nhis friends a great deal of mischief by entertaining him, for that he afforded\nhim an opportunity of being reconciled to his master by doing a mischief\nto our army. They thereupon desired him, out of a prudent foresight of\nthis, to send him away, with his six hundred armed men, to the place he\nhad given him for his habitation; for that this was that David whom the\nvirgins celebrated in their hymns, as having destroyed many ten thousands\nof the Philistines. When the king of Gath heard this, he thought they spake\nwell; so he called David, and said to him, As for myself,\nI can bear witness that thou hast shown great diligence and kindness about\nme, and on that account it was that I took thee for my confederate; however,\nwhat I have done does not please the commanders of the Philistines; go\ntherefore within a day's time to the place I have given thee, without suspecting\nany harm, and there keep my country, lest any of our enemies should make\nan incursion upon it, which will be one part of that assistance which I\nexpect from thee.\" So David came to Ziklag, as the king of Gath bade\nhim; but it happened, that while he was gone to the assistance of the Philistines,\nthe Amalekites had made an incursion, and taken Ziklag before, and had\nburnt it; and when they had taken a great deal of other prey out of that\nplace, and out of the other parts of the Philistines' country, they departed."}, "Now when David found that Ziklag was laid waste, and that it was\nall spoiled, and that as well his own wives, who were two, as the wives\nof his companions, with their children, were made captives, he presently\nrent his clothes, weeping and lamenting, together with his friends; and\nindeed he was so cast down with these misfortunes, that at length tears\nthemselves failed him. He was also in danger of being stoned to death by\nhis companions, who were greatly afflicted at the captivity of their wives\nand children, for they laid the blame upon him of what had happened. But\nwhen he had recovered himself out of his grief, and had raised up his mind\nto God, he desired the high priest Abiathar to put on his sacerdotal garments,\nand to inquire of God, and to prophesy to him, whether God would grant;\nthat if he pursued after the Amalekites, he should overtake them, and save\ntheir wives and their children, and avenge himself on the enemies. And\nwhen the high priest bade him to pursue after them, he marched apace, with\nhis four hundred men, after the enemy; and when he was come to a certain\nbrook called Besor, and had lighted upon one that was wandering about,\nan Egyptian by birth, who was almost dead with want and famine, (for he\nhad continued wandering about without food in the wilderness three days,)\nhe first of all gave him sustenance, both meat and drink, and thereby refreshed\nhim. He then asked him to whom he belonged, and whence he came. Whereupon\nthe man told him he was an Egyptian by birth, and was left behind by his\nmaster, because he was so sick and weak that he could not follow him. He\nalso informed him that he was one of those who had burnt and plundered,\nnot only other parts of Judea, but Ziklag itself also. So David made use\nof him as a guide to find oat the Amalekites; and when he had overtaken\nthem, as they lay scattered about on the ground, some at dinner, some disordered,\nand entirely drunk with wine, and in the fruition of their spoils and their\nprey, he fell upon them on the sudden, and made a great slaughter among\nthem; for they were naked, and expected no such thing, but had betaken\nthemselves to drinking and feasting; and so they were all easily destroyed.\nNow some of them that were overtaken as they lay at the table were slain\nin that posture, and their blood brought up with it their meat and their\ndrink. They slew others of them as they were drinking to one another in\ntheir cups, and some of them when their full bellies had made them fall\nasleep; and for so many as had time to put on their armor, they slew them\nwith the sword, with no less case than they did those that were naked;\nand for the partisans of David, they continued also the slaughter from\nthe first hour of the day to the evening, so that there were, not above\nfour hundred of the Amalekites left; and they only escaped by getting upon\ntheir dromedaries and camels. Accordingly David recovered not only all\nthe other spoils which the enemy had carried away, but his wives also,\nand the wives of his companions. But when they were come to the place where\nthey had left the two hundred men, which were not able to follow them,\nbut were left to take care of the stuff, the four hundred men did not think\nfit to divide among them any other parts of what they had gotten, or of\nthe prey, since they did not accompany them, but pretended to be feeble,\nand did not follow them in pursuit of the enemy, but said they should be\ncontented to have safely recovered their wives; yet did David pronounce\nthat this opinion of theirs was evil and unjust, and that when God had\ngranted them such a favor, that they had avenged themselves on their enemies,\nand had recovered all that belonged to themselves, they should make an\nequal distribution of what they had gotten to all, because the rest had\ntarried behind to guard their stuff; and from that time this law obtained\namong them, that those who guarded the stuff, should receive an equal share\nwith those that fought in the battle. Now when David was come to Ziklag,\nhe sent portions of the spoils to all that had been familiar with him,\nand to his friends in the tribe of Judah. And thus ended the affairs of\nthe plundering of Ziklag, and of the slaughter of the Amalekites.", "Now upon the Philistines joining battle, there followed a sharp engagement,\nand the Philistine, became the conquerors, and slew a great number of their\nenemies; but Saul the king of Israel, and his sons, fought courageously,\nand with the utmost alacrity, as knowing that their entire glory lay in\nnothing else but dying honorably, and exposing themselves to the utmost\ndanger from the enemy (for they had nothing else to hope for); so they\nbrought upon themselves the whole power of the enemy, till they were encompassed\nround and slain, but not before they had killed many of the Philistines\nNow the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchisua; and when\nthese were slain the multitude of the Hebrews were put to flight, and all\nwas disorder, and confusion, and slaughter, upon the Philistines pressing\nin upon them. But Saul himself fled, having a strong body of soldiers about\nhim; and upon the Philistines sending after them those that threw javelins\nand shot arrows, he lost all his company except a few. As for himself,\nhe fought with great bravery; and when he had received so many wounds,\nthat he was not able to bear up nor to oppose any longer, and yet was not\nable to kill himself, he bade his armor-bearer draw his sword, and run\nhim through, before the enemy should take him alive. But his armor-bearer\nnot daring to kill his master, he drew his own sword, and placing himself\nover against its point, he threw himself upon it; and when he could neither\nrun it through him, nor, by leaning against it, make the sword pass through\nhim, he turned him round, and asked a certain young man that stood by who\nhe was; and when he understood that he was an Amalekite, he desired him\nto force the sword through him, because he was not able to do it with his\nown hands, and thereby to procure him such a death as he desired. This\nthe young man did accordingly; and he took the golden bracelet that was\non Saul's arm, and his royal crown that was on his head, and ran away.\nAnd when Saul's armor-bearer saw that he was slain, he killed himself;\nnor did any of the king's guards escape, but they all fell upon the mountain\ncalled Gilboa. But when those Hebrews that dwelt in the valley beyond Jordan,\nand those who had their cities in the plain, heard that Saul and his sons\nwere fallen, and that the multitude about them were destroyed, they left\ntheir own cities, and fled to such as were the best fortified and fenced;\nand the Philistines, finding those cities deserted, came and dwelt in them.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This way of speaking in Josephus, of fasting \"seven days without meat\nor drink,\" is almost like that of St. Paul, Acts 27:33, \"This\nday is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried, and continued fasting,\nhaving taken nothing:\" and as the nature of the thing, and the impossibility\nof strictly fasting so long, require us here to understand both Josephus\nand the sacred author of this history, 1 Samuel 30:13, from whom he took\nit, of only fasting fill the evening; so must we understand St. Paul, either\nthat this was really the fourteenth day that they had taken nothing till\nthe evening, or else that this was the fourteenth day of their tempestuous\nweather in the Adriatic Sea, as ver. 27, and that on this fourteenth day\nalone they had continued fasting, and had taken nothing before that evening.\nThe mention of their long abstinence, ver. 21, inclines me to believe the\nformer explication to he the truth, and that the case was then for a fortnight\nwhat it was here for a week, that they kept all those days entirely as\nlasts till the evening, but not longer.

He had escaped out of the battle which the\nIsraelites had with the Philistines, and had his clothes rent, and ashes\nupon his head. And when he made his obeisance to David, he inquired of\nhim whence he came. He replied, from the battle of the Israelites; and\nhe informed him that the end of it was unfortunate, many ten thousands\nof the Israelites having been cut off, and Saul, together with his sons,\nslain. He also said that he could well give him this information, because\nhe was present at the victory gained over the Hebrews, and was with the\nking when he fled. Nor did he deny that he had himself slain the king,\nwhen he was ready to be taken by the enemy, and he himself exhorted him\nto do it, because, when he was fallen on his sword, his great wounds had\nmade him so weak that he was not able to kill himself. He also produced\ndemonstrations that the king was slain, which were the golden bracelets\nthat had been on the king's arms, and his crown, which he had taken away\nfrom Saul's dead body, and had brought them to him. So David having no\nlonger any room to call in question the truth of what he said, but seeing\nmost evident marks that Saul was dead, he rent his garments, and continued\nall that day with his companions in weeping and lamentation. This grief\nwas augmented by the consideration of Jonathan; the son of Saul, who had\nbeen his most faithful friend, and the occasion of his own deliverance.\nHe also demonstrated himself to have such great virtue, and such great\nkindness for Saul, as not only to take his death to heart, though he had\nbeen frequently in danger of losing his life by his means, but to punish\nhim that slew him; for when David had said to him that he was become his\nown accuser, as the very man who had slain the king, and when he had understood\nthat he was the son of an Amalekite, he commanded him to be slain.

But when he heard that the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead had\nburied Saul and his sons [honorably], he sent to them and commended them,\nand took what they had done kindly, and promised to make them amends for\ntheir care of those that were dead; and at the same time he informed them\nthat the tribe of Judah had chosen him for their king.", {"emph": ["Mahanaim", "The Camps;"], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "It\nought to be here noted, that Joab, Abishai, and Asahel were all three David's\nnephews, the sons of his sister Zeraiah, as 1 Chronicles 2:16; and that\nAmasa was also his nephew by his other sister Abigail, ver. 17."}, "#text": "But as soon as Abner, the son of Ner, who was general of Saul's army,\nand a very active man, and good-natured, knew that the king, and Jonathan,\nand his two other sons, were fallen in the battle, he made haste into the\ncamp; and taking away with him the remaining son of Saul, whose name was\nIshbosheth, he passed over to the land beyond Jordan, and ordained him\nthe king of the whole multitude, excepting the tribe of Judah; and made\nhis royal seat in a place called in our own language , but\nin the language of the Grecians,  from whence Abner\nmade haste with a select body of soldiers, to fight with such of the tribe\nof Judah as were disposed to it, for he was angry that this tribe had set\nup David for their king. But Joab, whose father was Suri, and his mother\nZeruiah, David's sister, who was general of David's army, met him, according\nto David's appointment. He had with him his brethren, Abistiai and Asahel,\nas also all David's armed men. Now when he met Abner at a certain fountain,\nin the city of Gibeon, he prepared to fight. And when Abner said to him,\nthat he had a mind to know which of them had the more valiant soldiers,\nit was agreed between them that twelve soldiers of each side should fight\ntogether. So those that were chosen out by both the generals for this fight\ncame between the two armies, and throwing their lances one against the\nother, they drew their swords, and catching one another by the head, they\nheld one another fast, and ran each other's swords into their sides and\ngroins, until they all, as it were by mutual agreement, perished together.\nWhen these were fallen down dead, the rest of the army came to a sore battle,\nand Abner's men were beaten; and when they were beaten, Joab did not leave\noff pursuing them, but he pressed upon them, and excited the soldiers to\nfollow them close, and not to grow weary of killing them. His brethren\nalso pursued them with great alacrity, especially the younger, Asahel,\nwho was the most eminent of them. He was very famous for his swiftness\nof foot, for he could not only be too hard for men, but is reported to\nhave overrun a horse, when they had a race together. This Asahel ran violently\nafter Abner, and would not turn in the least out of the straight way, either\nto the one side or to the other. Hereupon Abner turned back, and attempted\nartfully to avoid his violence. Sometimes he bade him leave off the pursuit,\nand take the armor of one of his soldiers; and sometimes, when he could\nnot persuade him so to do, he exhorted him to restrain himself, and not\nto pursue him any longer, lest he should force him to kill him, and he\nshould then not be able to look his brother in the face: but when Asahel\nwould not admit of any persuasions, but still continued to pursue him,\nAbner smote him with his spear, as he held it in his flight, and that by\na back-stroke, and gave him a deadly wound, so that he died immediately;\nbut those that were with him pursuing Abner, when they came to the place\nwhere Asahel lay, they stood round about the dead body, and left off the\npursuit of the enemy. However, both Joab \nhimself, and his brother Abishai, ran past the dead corpse, and making\ntheir anger at the death of Asahel an occasion of greater zeal against\nAbner, they went on with incredible haste and alacrity, and pursued Abner\nto a certain place called Ammah: it was about sun-set. Then did Joab ascend\na certain hill, as he stood at that place, having the tribe of Benjamin\nwith him, whence he took a view of them, and of Abner also. Hereupon Abner\ncried aloud, and said that it was not fit that they should irritate men\nof the same nation to fight so bitterly one against another; that as for\nAsahel his brother, he was himself in the wrong, when he would not be advised\nby him not to pursue him any farther, which was the occasion of his wounding\nand death. So Joab consented to what he said, and accepted these his words\nas an excuse [about Asahel], and called the soldiers back with the sound\nof the trumpet, as a signal for their retreat, and thereby put a stop to\nany further pursuit. After which Joab pitched his camp there that night;\nbut Abner marched all that night, and passed over the river Jordan, and\ncame to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, to Mahanaim. On the next day Joab counted\nthe dead men, and took care of all their funerals. Now there were slain\nof Abner's soldiers about three hundred and sixty; but of those of David\nnineteen, and Asahel, whose body Joab and Abishai carried to Bethlehem;\nand when they had buried him in the sepulcher of their fathers, they came\nto David to Hebron. From this time therefore there began an intestine war,\nwhich lasted a great while, in which the followers of David grew stronger\nin the dangers they underwent, and the servants and subjects of Saul's\nsons did almost every day become weaker."}, "About this time David was become the father of six sons, born\nof as many mothers. The eldest was by Ahinoam, and he was called Arenon;\nthe second was Daniel, by his wife Abigail; the name of the third was Absalom,\nby Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur; the fourth he named\nAdonijah, by his wife Haggith; the fifth was Shephatiah, by Abital; the\nsixth he called Ithream, by Eglah. Now while this intestine war went on,\nand the subjects of the two kings came frequently to action and to fighting,\nit was Abner, the general of the host of Saul's son, who, by his\nprudence, and the great interest he had among the multitude, made them\nall continue with Ishbosheth; and indeed it was a considerable time that\nthey continued of his party; but afterwards Abner was blamed, and an accusation\nwas laid against him, that he went in unto Saul's concubine: her name was\nRispah, the daughter of Aiah. So when he was complained of by Ishbosheth,\nhe was very uneasy and angry at it, because he had not justice done him\nby Ishbosheth, to whom he had shown the greatest kindness; whereupon he\nthreatened to transfer the kingdom to David, and demonstrate that he did\nnot rule over the people beyond Jordan by his own abilities and wisdom,\nbut by his warlike conduct and fidelity in leading his army. So he sent\nambassadors to Hebron to David, and desired that he would give him security\nupon oath that he would esteem him his companion and his friend, upon condition\nthat he should persuade the people to leave Saul's son, and choose him\nking of the whole country; and when David had made that league with Abner,\nfor he was pleased with his message to him, he desired that he would give\nthis as the first mark of performance of the present league, that he might\nhave his wife Michal restored to him, as her whom he had purchased with\ngreat hazards, and with those six hundred heads of the Philistines which\nhe had brought to Saul her father. So Abner took Michal from Phaltiel,\nwho was then her husband, and sent her to David, Ishbosheth himself affording\nhim his assistance, for David had written to him that of right he ought\nto have this his wife restored to him. Abner also called together the elders\nof the multitude, the commanders and captains of thousands, and spake thus\nto them: That he had formerly dissuaded them from their own resolution,\nwhen they were ready to forsake Ishbosheth, and to join themselves to David;\nthat, however, he now gave them leave so to do, if they had a mind to it,\nfor they knew that God had appointed David to be king of all the Hebrews\nby Samuel the prophet; and had foretold that he should punish the Philistines,\nand overcome them, and bring them under. Now when the elders and rulers\nheard this, and understood that Abner was come over to those sentiments\nabout the public affairs which they were of before, they changed their\nmeasures, and came in to David. When these men had agreed to Abner's proposal,\nhe called together the tribe of Benjamin, for all of that tribe were the\nguards of Ishbosheth's body, and he spake to them to the same purpose.\nAnd when he saw that they did not in the least oppose what he said, but\nresigned themselves up to his opinion, he took about twenty of his friends\nand came to David, in order to receive himself security upon oath from\nhim; for we may justly esteem those things to be firmer which every one\nof us do by ourselves, than those which we do by another. He also gave\nhim an account of what he had said to the rulers, and to the whole tribe\nof Benjamin; and when David had received him in a courteous manner, and\nhad treated him with great hospitality for many days, Abner, when he was\ndismissed, desired him to bring the multitude with him, that he might deliver\nup the government to him, when David himself was present, and a spectator\nof what was done.", {"emph": "Besira,", "#text": "When David had sent Abner away, Joab, the of his army, came immediately\nto Hebron; he had understood that Abner had been with David, and had parted\nwith him a little before under leagues and agreements that the government\nshould be delivered up to David, he feared lest David should place Abner,\nwho had assisted him to gain the kingdom, in the first rank of dignity,\nespecially since he was a shrewd man in other respects, in understanding\naffairs, and in managing them artfully, as proper seasons should require,\nand that he should himself be put lower, and be deprived of the command\nof the army; so he took a knavish and a wicked course. In the first place,\nhe endeavored to calumniate Abner to the king, exhorting him to have a\ncare of him, and not to give attention to what he had engaged to do for\nhim, because all he did tended to confirm the government to Saul's son;\nthat he came to him deceitfully and with guile, and was gone away in hopes\nof gaining his purpose by this management: but when he could not thus persuade\nDavid, nor saw him at all exasperated, he betook himself to a project bolder\nthan the former: - he determined to kill Abner; and in order thereto, he\nsent some messengers after him, to whom he gave in charge, that when they\nshould overtake him they should recall him in David's name, and tell him\nthat he had somewhat to say to him about his affairs, which he had not\nremembered to speak of when he was with him. Now when Abner heard what\nthe messengers said, (for they overtook him in a certain place called which was distant from Hebron twenty furlongs,) he suspected none of\nthe mischief which was befalling him, and came back. Hereupon Joab met\nhim in the gate, and received him in the kindest manner, as if he were\nAbner's most benevolent acquaintance and friend; for such as undertake\nthe vilest actions, in order to prevent the suspicion of any private mischief\nintended, do frequently make the greatest pretenses to what really good\nmen sincerely do. So he took him aside from his own followers, as if he\nwould speak with him in private, and brought him into a void place of the\ngate, having himself nobody with him but his brother Abishai; then he drew\nhis sword, and smote him in the groin; upon which Abner died by this treachery\nof Joab, which, as he said himself, was in the way of punishment for his\nbrother Asahel, whom Abner smote and slew as he was pursuing after him\nin the battle of Hebron, but as the truth was, out of his fear of losing\nhis command of the army, and his dignity with the king, and lest he should\nbe deprived of those advantages, and Abner should obtain the first rank\nin David's court. By these examples any one may learn how many and how\ngreat instances of wickedness men will venture upon for the sake of getting\nmoney and authority, and that they may not fail of either of them; for\nas when they are desirous of obtaining the same, they acquire them by ten\nthousand evil practices; so when they are afraid of losing them, they get\nthem confirmed to them by practices much worse than the former, as if no\nother calamity so terrible could befall them as the failure of acquiring\nso exalted an authority; and when they have acquired it, and by long custom\nfound the sweetness of it, the losing it again: and since this last would\nbe the heaviest of all afflictions they all of them contrive and venture\nupon the most difficult actions, out of the fear of losing the same. But\nlet it suffice that I have made these short reflections upon that subject."}, "When David heard that Abner was slain, it grieved his soul; and he\ncalled all men to witness, with stretching out his hands to God, and crying\nout that he was not a partaker in the murder of Abner, and that his death\nwas not procured by his command or approbation. He also wished the heaviest\ncurses might light upon him that slew him and upon his whole house; and\nhe devoted those that had assisted him in this murder to the same penalties\non its account; for he took care not to appear to have had any hand in\nthis murder, contrary to the assurances he had given and the oaths he had\ntaken to Abner. However, he commanded all the people to weep and lament\nthis man, and to honor his dead body with the usual solemnities; that is,\nby rending their garments, and putting on sackcloth, and that things should\nbe the habit in which they should go before the bier; after which he followed\nit himself, with the elders and those that were rulers, lamenting Abner,\nand by his tears demonstrating his good-will to him while he was alive,\nand his sorrow for him now he was dead, and that he was not taken off with\nhis consent. So he buried him at Hebron in a magnificent manner, and indited\nfuneral elegies for him; he also stood first over the monument weeping,\nand caused others to do the same; nay, so deeply did the death of Abner\ndisorder him, that his companions could by no means force him to take any\nfood, but he affirmed with an oath that he would taste nothing till the\nsun was set. This procedure gained him the good-will of the multitude;\nfor such as had an affection for Abner were mightily satisfied with the\nrespect he paid him when he was dead, and the observation of that faith\nhe had plighted to him, which was shown in his vouchsafing him all the\nusual ceremonies, as if he had been his kinsman and his friend, and not\nsuffering him to be neglected and injured with a dishonorable burial, as\nif he had been his enemy; insomuch that the entire nation rejoiced at the\nking's gentleness and mildness of disposition, every one being ready to\nsuppose that the king would have taken the same care of them in the like\ncircumstances, which they saw be showed in the burial of the dead body\nof Abner. And indeed David principally intended to gain a good reputation,\nand therefore he took care to do what was proper in this case, whence none\nhad any suspicion that he was the author of Abner's death. He also said\nthis to the multitude, that he was greatly troubled at the death of so\ngood a man; and that the affairs of the Hebrews had suffered great detriment\nby being deprived of him, who was of so great abilities to preserve them\nby his excellent advice, and by the strength of his hands in war. But he\nadded, that \"God, who hath a regard to all men's actions, will not\nsuffer this man [Joab] to go off unrevenged; but know ye, that I am not\nable to do any thing to these sons of Zeruiah, Joab and Abishai, who have\nmore power than I have; but God will requite their insolent attempts upon\ntheir own heads.\" And this was the fatal conclusion of the life of\nAbner.", "WHEN Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, had heard of the death of Abner,\nhe took it to heart to be deprived of a man that was of his kindred, and\nhad indeed given him the kingdom, but was greatly afflicted, and\nAbner's death very much troubled him; nor did he himself outlive any long\ntime, but was treacherously set upon by the sons of Rimmon, (Baanah and\nRechab were their names,) and was slain by them; for these being of a family\nof the Benjamites, and of the first rank among them, thought that if they\nshould slay Ishbosheth, they should obtain large presents from David, and\nbe made commanders by him, or, however, should have some other trust committed\nto them. So when they once found him alone, and asleep at noon, in an upper\nroom, when none of his guards were there, and when the woman that kept\nthe door was not watching, but was fallen asleep also, partly on account\nof the labor she had undergone, and partly on account of the heat of the\nday, these men went into the room in which Ishbosheth, Saul's son, lay\nasleep, and slew him; they also cut off his head, and took their journey\nall that night, and the next day, as supposing themselves flying away from\nthose they had injured, to one that would accept of this action as a favor,\nand would afford them security. So they came to Hebron, and showed David\nthe head of Ishbosheth, and presented themselves to him as his well-wishers,\nand such as had killed one that was his enemy and antagonist. Yet David\ndid not relish what they had done as they expected, but said to them, \"You\nvile wretches, you shall immediately receive the punishment you deserve.\nDid not you know what vengeance I executed on him that murdered Saul, and\nbrought me his crown of gold, and this while he who made this slaughter\ndid it as a favor to him, that he might not be caught by his enemies? Or\ndo you imagine that I am altered in my disposition, and suppose that I\nam not the same man I then was, but am pleased with men that are wicked\ndoers, and esteem your vile actions, when you are become murderers of your\nmaster, as grateful to me, when you have slain a righteous man upon his\nbed, who never did evil to any body, and treated you with great good-will\nand respect? Wherefore you shall suffer the punishment due on his account,\nand the vengeance I ought to inflict upon you for killing Ishbosheth, and\nfor supposing that I should take his death kindly at your hands; for you\ncould not lay a greater blot on my honor, than by making such a supposal.\"\nWhen David had said this, he tormented them with all sorts of torments,\nand then put them to death; and he bestowed all accustomed rites on the\nburial of the head of Ishbosheth, and laid it in the grave of Abner.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This\nmay be a true observation of Josephus's, that Samuel by command from God\nentailed the crown on David and his posteerity; for no further did that\nentail ever reach, Solomon himself having never had any promise made him\nthat his posterity should always have the right to it."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "These\nwords of Josephus concerning the tribe of Issachar, \"who foreknew what was\nto come hereafter,\" are best paraphrased by the parallel text. 1 Chronicles\n12:32, \"Who had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought\nto do;\" that is, who had so much knowledge in astronomy as to make\ncalendars for the Israelites, that they might keep their festivals, and\nplough and sow, and gather in their harvests and vintage, in due season."}], "#text": "When these things were brought to this conclusion, all the principal\nmen of the Hebrew people came to David to Hebron, with the heads of thousands,\nand other rulers, and delivered themselves up to him, putting him in mind\nof the good-will they had borne to him in Saul's lifetime, and the respect\nthey then had not ceased to pay him when he was captain of a thousand,\nas also that he was chosen of God by Samuel the prophet, he and his sons;\n and declaring\nbesides, how God had given him power to save the land of the Hebrews, and\nto overcome the Philistines.

Nor did God give\nvictory and success to him only when he went to the battle himself, and\nled his own army, but he gave victory to Abishai, the brother of Joab,\ngeneral of his forces, over the Idumeans, \nand by him to David, when he sent him with an army into Idumea: for Abishai\ndestroyed eighteen thousand of them in the battle; whereupon the king [of\nIsrael] placed garrisons through all Idumea, and received the tribute of\nthe country, and of every head among them. Now David was in his nature\njust, and made his determination with regard to truth. He had for the general\nof his whole army Joab; and he made Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, recorder.\nHe also appointed Zadok, of the family of Phinehas, to be high priest,\ntogether with Abiathar, for he was his friend.

He therefore gave order that inquiry should\nbe made, whether any of Jonathan's lineage were living, to whom he might\nmake return of that familiar acquaintance which Jonathan had had with him,\nand for which he was still debtor. And when one of Saul's freed men was\nbrought to him, who was acquainted with those of his family that were still\nliving, he asked him whether he could tell him of any one belonging to\nJonathan that was now alive, and capable of a requital of the benefits\nwhich he had received from Jonathan. And he said, that a son of his was\nremaining, whose name was Mephibosheth, but that he was lame of his feet;\nfor that when his nurse heard that the father and grandfather of the child\nwere fallen in the battle, she snatched him up, and fled away, and let\nhim fall from her shoulders, and his feet were lamed. So when he had learned\nwhere and by whom he was brought up, he sent messengers to Machir, to the\ncity of Lodebar, for with him was the son of Jonathan brought up, and sent\nfor him to come to him. So when Mephibosheth came to the king, he fell\non his face and worshipped him; but David encouraged him, bade him be of\ngood cheer, and expect better times. So he gave him his father's house,\nand all the estate which his grandfather Saul was in possession of, and\nbade him come and diet with him at his own table, and never to be absent\none day from that table. And when the youth had worshipped him on account\nof his words and gifts given to him, he called for Ziba, and told him that\nhe had given the youth his father's house, and all Saul's estate. He also\nordered that Ziba should cultivate his land, and take care of it, and bring\nhim the profits of all to Jerusalem. Accordingly, David brought him to\nhis table every day, and bestowed upon the youth, Ziba and his sons, who\nwere in number fifteen, and his servants, who were in number twenty. When\nthe king had made these appointments, and Ziba had worshipped him, and\npromised to do all that he had bidden him, he went his way; so that this\nson of Jonathan dwelt at Jerusalem, and dieted at the king's table, and\nhad the same care that a son could claim taken of him. He also had himself\na son, whom he named Micha.", "THIS were the honors that such as were left of Saul's and Jonathan's\nlineage received from David. About this time died Nahash, the king of the\nAmmonites, who was a friend of David's; and when his son had succeeded\nhis father in the kingdom, David sent ambassadors to him to comfort him;\nand exhorted him to take his father's death patiently, and to expect that\nhe would continue the same kindness to himself which he had shown to his\nfather. But the princes of the Ammonites took this message in evil part,\nand not as David's kind dispositions gave reason to take it; and they excited\nthe king to resent it; and said that David had sent men to spy out the\ncountry, and what strength it had, under the pretense of humanity and kindness.\nThey further advised him to have a care, and not to give heed to David's\nwords, lest he should be deluded by him, and so fall into an inconsolable\ncalamity. Accordingly Nahash's [son], the king of the Ammonites, thought\nthese princes spake what was more probable than the truth would admit,\nand so abused the ambassadors after a very harsh manner; for he shaved\nthe one half of their beards, and cut off one half of their garments, and\nsent his answer, not in words, but in deeds. When the king of Israel saw\nthis, he had indignation at it, and showed openly that he would not overlook\nthis injurious and contumelious treatment, but would make war with the\nAmmonites, and would avenge this wicked treatment of his ambassadors on\ntheir king. So that king's intimate friends and commanders, understanding\nthat they had violated their league, and were liable to be punished for\nthe same, made preparations for war; they also sent a thousand talents\nto the Syrian king of Mesopotamia, and endeavored to prevail with him to\nassist them for that pay, and Shobach. Now these kings had twenty thousand\nfootmen. They also hired the king of the country called Maacah, and a fourth\nking, by name Ishtob; which last had twelve thousand armed men.", "But David was under no consternation at this confederacy, nor at\nthe forces of the Ammonites; and putting his trust in God, because he was\ngoing to war in a just cause, on account of the injurious treatment he\nhad met with, he immediately sent Joab, the captain of his host, against\nthem, and gave him the flower of his army, who pitched his camp by Rabbah,\nthe metropolis of the Ammonites; whereupon the enemy came out, and set\nthemselves in array, not all of them together, but in two bodies; for the\nauxiliaries were set in array in the plain by themselves, but the army\nof the Ammonites at the gates over against the Hebrews. When Joab saw this,\nhe opposed one stratagem against another, and chose out the most hardy\npart of his men, and set them in opposition to the king of Syria, and the\nkings that were with him, and gave the other part to his brother Abishai,\nand bid him set them in opposition to the Ammonites; and said to him, that\nin case he should see that the Syrians distressed him, and were too hard\nfor him, he should order his troops to turn about and assist him; and he\nsaid that he himself would do the same to him, if he saw him in the like\ndistress from the Ammonites. So he sent his brother before, and encouraged\nhim to do every thing courageously and with alacrity, which would teach\nthem to be afraid of disgrace, and to fight manfully; and so he dismissed\nhim to fight with the Ammonites, while he fell upon the Syrians. And though\nthey made a strong opposition for a while, Joab slew many of them, but\ncompelled the rest to betake themselves to flight; which, when the Ammonites\nsaw, and were withal afraid of Abishai and his army, they staid\nno longer, but imitated their auxiliaries, and fled to the city. So Joab,\nwhen he had thus overcome the enemy, returned with great joy to Jerusalem\nto the king.", "This defeat did not still induce the Ammonites to be quiet, nor to\nown those that were superior to them to be so, and be still, but they sent\nto Chalaman, the king of the Syrians, beyond Euphrates, and hired him for\nan auxiliary. He had Shobach for the captain of his host, with eighty thousand\nfootmen, and ten thousand horsemen. Now when the king of the Hebrews understood\nthat the Ammonites had again gathered so great an army together, he determined\nto make war with them no longer by his generals, but he passed over the\nriver Jordan himself with all his army; and when he met them he joined\nbattle with them, and overcame them, and slew forty thousand of their footmen,\nand seven thousand of their horsemen. He also wounded Shobach, the general\nof Chalaman's forces, who died of that stroke; but the people of Mesopotamia,\nupon such a conclusion of the battle, delivered themselves up to David,\nand sent him presents, who at winter time returned to Jerusalem. But at\nthe beginning of the spring he sent Joab, the captain of his host, to fight\nagainst the Ammonites, who overran all their country, and laid it waste,\nand shut them up in their metropolis Rabbah, and besieged them therein.", "BUT David fell now into a very grievous sin, though he were otherwise\nnaturally a righteous and a religious man, and one that firmly observed\nthe laws of our fathers; for when late in an evening he took a view round\nhim from the roof of his royal palace, where he used to walk at that hour,\nhe saw a woman washing herself in her own house: she was one of extraordinary\nbeauty, and therein surpassed all other women; her name was Bathsheba.\nSo he was overcome by that woman's beauty, and was not able to restrain\nhis desires, but sent for her, and lay with her. Hereupon she conceived\nwith child, and sent to the king, that he should contrive some way for\nconcealing her sin (for, according to the laws of their fathers, she who\nhad been guilty of adultery ought to be put to death). So the king sent\nfor Joab's armor-bearer from the siege, who was the woman's husband, and\nhis name was Uriah. And when he was come, the king inquired of him about\nthe army, and about the siege; and when he had made answer that all their\naffairs went according to their wishes, the king took some portions of\nmeat from his supper, and gave them to him, and bade him go home to his\nwife, and take his rest with her. Uriah did not do so, but slept near the\nking with the rest of his armor-bearers. When the king was informed of\nthis, he asked him why he did not go home to his house, and to his wife,\nafter so long an absence; which is the natural custom of all men, when\nthey come from a long journey. He replied, that it was not right, while\nhis fellow soldiers, and the general of the army, slept upon the ground,\nin the camp, and in an enemy's country, that he should go and take his\nrest, and solace himself with his wife. So when he had thus replied, the\nking ordered him to stay there that night, that he might dismiss him the\nnext day to the general. So the king invited Uriah to supper, and after\na cunning and dexterous manlier plied him with drink at supper, till he\nwas thereby disordered; yet did he nevertheless sleep at the king's gates\nwithout any inclination to go to his wife. Upon this the king was very\nangry at him; and wrote to Joab, and commanded him to punish Uriah, for\nhe told him that he had offended him; and he suggested to him the manner\nin which he would have him punished, that it might not be discovered that\nhe was himself the author of this his punishment; for he charged him to\nset him over against that part of the enemy's army where the attack would\nbe most hazardous, and where he might be deserted, and be in the greatest\njeopardy, for he bade him order his fellow soldiers to retire out of the\nfight. When he had written thus to him, and sealed the letter with his\nown seal, he gave it to Uriah to carry to Joab. When Joab had received\nit, and upon reading it understood the king's purpose, he set Uriah in\nthat place where he knew the enemy would be most troublesome to them; and\ngave him for his partners some of the best soldiers in the army; and said\nthat he would also come to their assistance with the whole army, that if\npossible they might break down some part of the wall, and enter the city.\nAnd he desired him to be glad of the opportunity of exposing himself to\nsuch great pains, and not to be displeased at it, since he was a valiant\nsoldier, and had a great reputation for his valor, both with the king and\nwith his countrymen. And when Uriah undertook the work he was set upon\nwith alacrity, he gave private orders to those who were to be his companions,\nthat when they saw the enemy make a sally, they should leave him. When,\ntherefore, the Hebrews made an attack upon the city, the Ammonites were\nafraid that the enemy might prevent them, and get up into the city, and\nthis at the very place whither Uriah was ordered; so they exposed their\nbest soldiers to be in the forefront, and opened their gates suddenly,\nand fell upon the enemy with great vehemence, and ran violently upon them.\nWhen those that were with Uriah saw this, they all retreated backward,\nas Joab had directed them beforehand; but Uriah, as ashamed to run away\nand leave his post, sustained the enemy, and receiving the violence of\ntheir onset, he slew many of them; but being encompassed round, and caught\nin the midst of them, he was slain, and some other of his companions were\nslain with him.", "When this was done, Joab sent messengers to the king, and ordered\nthem to tell him that he did what he could to take the city soon; but that,\nas they made an assault on the wall, they had been forced to retire with\ngreat loss; and bade them, if they saw the king was angry at it, to add\nthis, that Uriah was slain also. When the king had heard this of the messengers,\nhe took it heinously, and said that they did wrong when they assaulted\nthe wall, whereas they ought, by undermining and other stratagems of war,\nto endeavor the taking of rite city, especially when they had before their\neyes the example of Abimelech, the son of Gideon, who would needs take\nthe tower in Thebes by force, and was killed by a large stone thrown at\nhim by an old woman; and although he was a man of great prowess, he died\nignominiously by the dangerous manner of his assault: that they should\nremember this accident, and not come near the enemy's wall, for that the\nbest method of making war with success was to call to mind the accidents\nof former wars, and what good or bad success had attended them in the like\ndangerous cases, that so they might imitate the one, and avoid the other.\nBut when the king was in this disposition, the messenger told him that\nUriah was slain also; whereupon he was pacified. So he bade the messenger\ngo back to Joab and tell him that this misfortune is no other than what\nis common among mankind, and that such is the nature, and such the accidents\nof war, insomuch that sometimes the enemy will have success therein, and\nsometimes others; but that he ordered him to go on still in his care about\nthe siege, that no ill accident might befall him in it hereafter; that\nthey should raise bulwarks and use machines in besieging the city; and\nwhen they have gotten it, to overturn its very foundations, and to destroy\nall those that are in it. Accordingly the messenger carried the king's\nmessage with which he was charged, and made haste to Joab. But Bathsheba,\nthe wife of Uriah, when she was informed of the death of her husband, mourned\nfor his death many days; and when her mourning was over, and the tears\nwhich she shed for Uriah were dried up, the king took her to wife presently;\nand a son was born to him by her.", "With this marriage God was not well pleased, but was thereupon angry\nat David; and he appeared to Nathan the prophet in his sleep, and complained\nof the king. Now Nathan was a fair and prudent man; and considering that\nkings, when they fall into a passion, are guided more by that passion than\nthey are by justice, he resolved to conceal the threatenings that proceeded\nfrom God, and made a good-natured discourse to him, and this after the.\nmanner following: - He desired that the king would give him his opinion\nin the following case: - \"There were,\" said he, \"two men inhabiting\nthe same city, the one of them was rich, and [the other poor]. The rich\nman had a great many flocks of cattle, of sheep, and of kine; but the poor\nman had but one ewe lamb. This he brought up with his children, and let\nher eat her food with them; and he had the same natural affection for her\nwhich any one might have for a daughter. Now upon the coming of a stranger\nto the rich man, he would not vouchsafe to kill any of his own flocks,\nand thence feast his friend; but he sent for the poor man's lamb, and took\nher away from him, and made her ready for food, and thence feasted the\nstranger.\" This discourse troubled the king exceedingly; and he denounced\nto Nathan, that \"this man was a wicked man who could dare to do such\na thing; and that it was but just that he should restore the lamb fourfold,\nand be punished with death for it also.\" Upon this Nathan immediately\nsaid that he was himself the man who ought to suffer those punishments,\nand that by his own sentence; and that it was he who had perpetrated this\n'great and horrid crime. He also revealed to him, and laid before him,\nthe anger of God against him, who had made him king over the army of the\nHebrews, and lord of all the nations, and those many and great nations\nround about him; who had formerly delivered him out of the hands of Saul,\nand had given him such wives as he had justly and legally married; and\nnow this God was despised by him, and affronted by his impiety, when he\nhad married, and now had, another man's wife; and by exposing her husband\nto the enemy, had really slain him; 'that God would inflict punishments\nupon him on account of those instances of wickedness; that his own wives\nshould be forced by one of his sons; and that he should be treacherously\nsupplanted by the same son; and that although he had perpetrated his wickedness\nsecretly, yet should that punishment which he was to undergo be inflicted\npublicly upon him; \"that, moreover,\" said he, \"the child\nwhich was born to thee of her shall soon die.\" When the king was troubled\nat these messages, and sufficiently confounded, and said with tears and\nsorrow that he had sinned, (for he was without controversy a pious man,\nand guilty of no sin at all in his whole life, excepting those in the matter\nof Uriah,) God had compassion on him, and was reconciled to him, and promised\nthat he would preserve to him both his life and his kingdom; for he said\nthat, seeing he repented of the things he had done, he was no longer displeased\nwith him. So Nathan, when he had delivered this prophecy to the king, returned\nhome.", "However, God sent a dangerous distemper upon the child that was born\nto David of the wife of Uriah, at which the king was troubled, and did\nnot take any food for seven days, although his servants almost forced him\nto take it; but he clothed himself in a black garment, and fell down, and\nlay upon the ground in sackcloth, entrusting God for the recovery of the\nchild, for he vehemently loved the child's mother; but when, on the seventh\nday, the child was dead, the king's servants durst not tell him of it,\nas supposing that when he knew it, he would still less admit of food, and\nother care of himself, by reason of his grief at the death of his son,\nsince when the child was only sick, he so greatly afflicted himself, and\ngrieved for him: but when the king perceived that his servants were in\ndisorder, and seemed to be affected, as those who are very desirous to\nconceal something, he understood that the child was dead; and when he had\ncalled one of his servants to him, and discovered that so it was, he arose\nup and washed himself, and took a white garment, and came into the tabernacle\nof God. He also commanded them to set supper before him, and thereby greatly\nsurprised his kindred and servants, while he did nothing of this when the\nchild was sick, but did it all when he was dead. Whereupon having first\nbegged leave to ask him a question, they besought him to tell them the\nreason of this his conduct; he then called them unskillful people, and\ninstructed them how he had hopes of the recovery of the child while it\nwas alive, and accordingly did all that was proper for him to do, as thinking\nby such means to render God propitious to him; but that when the child\nwas dead, there was no longer any occasion for grief, which was then to\nno purpose. When he had said this, they commended the king's wisdom and\nunderstanding. He then went in unto Bathsheba his wife, and she conceived\nand bare a son; and by the command of Nathan the prophet called his name\nSolomon.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "That a talent of gold was about seven pounds weight, see the description\nof the temple ch. 13.

Upon this letter of Joab's,\nthe king accepted of his good-will and fidelity, and took with him his\narmy, and came to the destruction of Rabbah; and when he had taken it by\nforce, he gave it to his soldiers to plunder it; but he himself took the\nking of the Ammonites' crown, whose weight was a talent of gold; \nand it had in its middle a precious stone called a sardonyx; which crown\nDavid ever after wore on his own head. He also found many other vessels\nin the city, and those both splendid and of great price; but as for the\nmen, he tormented them, \nand then destroyed them; and when he had taken the other cities of the\nAmmonites by force, he treated them after the same manner."}, "WHEN the king was returned to Jerusalem, a sad misfortune befell\nhis house, on the occasion following: He had a daughter, who was yet a\nvirgin, and very handsome, insomuch that she surpassed all the most beautiful\nwomen; her name was Tamar; she had the same mother with Absalom. Now Amnon,\nDavid's eldest son, fell in love with her, and being not able to obtain\nhis desires, on account of her virginity, and the custody she was under,\nwas so much out of order, nay, his grief so eat up his body, that he grew\nlean, and his color was changed. Now there was one Jenadab, a kinsman and\nfriend of his, who discovered this his passion, for he was an extraordinary\nwise man, and of great sagacity of mind. When, therefore, he saw that every\nmorning Amnon was not in body as he ought to be, he came to him, and desired\nhim to tell him what was the cause of it: however, he said that he guessed\nthat it arose from the passion of love. Amnon confessed his passion, that\nhe was in love with a sister of his, who had the same father with himself.\nSo Jenadab suggested to him by what method and contrivance he might obtain\nhis desires; for he persuaded him to pretend sickness, and bade him, when\nhis father should come to him, to beg of him that his sister might come\nand minister to him; for if that were done, he should be better, and should\nquickly recover from his distemper. So Amnon lay down on his bed, and pretended\nto be sick, as Jonadab had suggested. When his father came, and inquired\nhow he did, he begged of him to send his sister to him. Accordingly, he\npresently ordered her to be brought to him; and when she was come, Amnon\nbade her make cakes for him, and fry them in a pan, and do it all with\nher own hands, because he should take them better from her hand [than from\nany one's else]. So she kneaded the flour in the sight of her brother,\nand made him cakes, and baked them in a pan, and brought them to him; but\nat that time he would not taste them, but gave order to his servants to\nsend all that were there out of his chamber, because he had a mind to repose\nhimself, free from tumult and disturbance. As soon as what he had commanded\nwas done, he desired his sister to bring his supper to him into the inner\nparlor; which, when the damsel had done, he took hold of her, and endeavored\nto persuade her to lie with him. Whereupon the damsel cried out, and said,\n\"Nay, brother, do not force me, nor be so wicked as to transgress\nthe laws, and bring upon thyself the utmost confusion. Curb this thy unrighteous\nand impure lust, from which our house will get nothing but reproach and\ndisgrace.\" She also advised him to speak to his father about this\naffair; for he would permit him [to marry her]. This she said, as desirous\nto avoid her brother's violent passion at present. But he would not yield\nto her; but, inflamed with love and blinded with the vehemency of his passion,\nhe forced his sister: but as soon as Amnon had satisfied his lust, he hated\nher immediately, and giving her reproachful words, bade her rise up and\nbe gone. And when she said that this was a more injurious treatment than\nthe former, if, now he had forced her, he would not let her stay with him\ntill the evening, but bid her go away in the day-time, and while it was\nlight, that she might meet with people that would be witnesses of her shame,\n- he commanded his servant to turn her out of his house. Whereupon she\nwas sorely grieved at the injury and violence that had been offered to\nher, and rent her loose coat, (for the virgins of old time wore such loose\ncoats tied at the hands, and let down to the ankles, that the inner coats\nmight not be seen,) and sprinkled ashes on her head; and went up the middle\nof the city, crying out and lamenting for the violence that had been offered\nher. Now Absalom, her brother, happened to meet her, and asked her what\nsad thing had befallen her, that she was in that plight; and when she had\ntold him what injury had been offered her, he comforted her, and desired\nher to be quiet, and take all patiently, and not to esteem her being corrupted\nby her brother as an injury. So she yielded to his advice, and left off\nher crying out, and discovering the force offered her to the multitude;\nand she continued as a widow with her brother Absalom a long time.", "When David his father knew this, he was grieved at the actions of\nAmnon; but because he had an extraordinary affection for him, for he was\nhis eldest son, he was compelled not to afflict him; but Absalom watched\nfor a fit opportunity of revenging this crime upon him, for he thoroughly\nhated him. Now the second year after this wicked affair about his sister\nwas over, and Absalom was about to go to shear his own sheep at Baalhazor,\nwhich is a city in the portion of Ephraim, he besought his father, as well\nas his brethren, to come and feast with him: but when David excused himself,\nas not being willing to be burdensome to him, Absalom desired he would\nhowever send his brethren; whom he did send accordingly. Then Absalom charged\nhis own servants, that when they should see Amnon disordered and drowsy\nwith wine, and he should give them a signal, they should fear nobody, but\nkill him.", "When they had done as they were commanded, the rest of his brethren\nwere astonished and disturbed, and were afraid for themselves, so they\nimmediately got on horseback, and rode away to their father; but somebody\nthere was who prevented them, and told their father they were all slain\nby Absalom; whereupon he was overcome with sorrow, as for so many of his\nsons that were destroyed at once, and that by their brother also; and by\nthis consideration, that it was their brother that appeared to have slain\nthem, he aggravated his sorrow for them. So he neither inquired what was\nthe cause of this slaughter, nor staid to hear any thing else, which yet\nit was but reasonable to have done, when so very great, and by that greatness\nso incredible, a misfortune was related to him: he rent his clothes and\nthrew himself upon the ground, and there lay lamenting the loss of all\nhis sons, both those who, as he was informed, were slain, and of him who\nslew them. But Jonadab, the son of his brother Shemeah, entreated him not\nto indulge his sorrow so far, for as to the rest of his sons he did not\nbelieve that they were slain, for he found no cause for such a suspicion;\nbut he said it might deserve inquiry as to Amnon, for it was not unlikely\nthat Absalom might venture to kill him on account of the injury he had\noffered to Tamar. In the mean time, a great noise of horses, and a tumult\nof some people that were coming, turned their attention to them; they were\nthe king's sons, who were fled away from the feast. So their father met\nthem as they were in their grief, and he himself grieved with them; but\nit was more than he expected to see those his sons again, whom he had a\nlittle before heard to have perished. However, their were tears on both\nsides; they lamenting their brother who was killed, and the king lamenting\nhis son, who was killed also; but Absalom fled to Geshur, to his grandfather\nby his mother's side, who was king of that country, and he remained with\nhim three whole years.", "Now David had a design to send to Absalom, not that he should come\nto be punished, but that he might be with him, for the effects of his anger\nwere abated by length of time. It was Joab, the captain of his host, that\nchiefly persuaded him so to do; for he suborned an ordinary woman, that\nwas stricken in age, to go to the king in mourning apparel, who said thus\nto him: - That two of her sons, in a coarse way, had some difference between\nthem, and that in the progress of that difference they came to an open\nquarrel, and that one was smitten by the other, and was dead; and she desired\nhim to interpose in this case, and to do her the favor to save this her\nson from her kindred, who were very zealous to have him that had slain\nhis brother put to death, that so she might not be further deprived of\nthe hopes she had of being taken care of in her old age by him; and that\nif he would hinder this slaughter of her son by those that wished for it,\nhe would do her a great favor, because the kindred would not be restrained\nfrom their purpose by any thing else than by the fear of him. And when\nthe king had given his consent to what the woman had begged of him, she\nmade this reply to him: - \"I owe thee thanks for thy benignity to\nme in pitying my old age, and preventing the loss of my only remaining\nchild; but in order to assure me of this thy kindness, be first reconciled\nto thine own son, and cease to be angry with him; for how shall I persuade\nmyself that thou hast really bestowed this favor upon me, while thou thyself\ncontinuest after the like manner in thy wrath to thine own son? for it\nis a foolish thing to add willfully another to thy dead son, while the\ndeath of the other was brought about without thy consent.\" And now\nthe king perceived that this pretended story was a subornation derived\nfrom Joab, and was of his contrivance; and when, upon inquiry of the old\nwoman, he understood it to be so in reality, he called for Joab, and told\nhim he had obtained what he requested according to his own mind; and he\nbid him bring Absalom back, for he was not now displeased, but had already\nceased to be angry with him.

Now his beauty\nwas not impaired, either by the grief he had been under, or by the want\nof such care as was proper to be taken of a king's son, for he still surpassed\nand excelled all men in the tallness of his body, and was more eminent\n[in a fine appearance] than those that dieted the most luxuriously; and\nindeed such was the thickness of the hair of his head, that it was with\ndifficulty that he was polled every eighth day; and his hair weighed two\nhundred shekels \nwhich are five pounds. However, he dwelt in Jerusalem two years, and became\nthe father of three sons, and one daughter; which daughter was of very\ngreat beauty, and which Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, took to wife afterward,\nand had by her a son named Abijah. But Absalom sent to Joab, and desired\nhim to pacify his father entirely towards him; and to beseech him to give\nhim leave to come to him to see him, and speak with him. But when Joab\nneglected so to do, he sent some of his own servants, and set fire to the\nfield adjoining to him; which, when Joab understood, he came to Absalom,\nand accused him of what he had done; and asked him the reason why he did\nso. To which Absalom replied, that \"I have found out this stratagem\nthat might bring thee to us, while thou hast taken no care to perform\nthe injunction I laid upon thee, which was this, to reconcile my father\nto me; and I really beg it of thee, now thou art here, to pacify my father\nas to me, since I esteem my coming hither to be more grievous than my banishment,\nwhile my father's wrath against me continues.\" Hereby Joab was persuaded,\nand pitied the distress that Absalom was in, and became an intercessor\nwith the king for him.

As soon as this news was brought\nto David, and he was informed of what he did not expect from his sonhe was aftrighted at this his impious and bold undertaking, and wondered\nthat he was so far from remembering how his offense had been so lately\nforgiven him, that he undertook much worse and more wicked enterprises;\nfirst, to deprive him of that kingdom which was given him of God; and secondly,\nto take away his own father's life. He therefore resolved to fly to the\nparts beyond Jordan: so he called his most intimate friends together, and\ncommunicated to them all that he had heard of his son's madness. He committed\nhimself to God, to judge between them about all their actions; and left\nthe care of his royal palace to his ten concubines, and went away from\nJerusalem, being willingly accompanied by the rest of the multitude, who\nwent hastily away with him, and particularly by those six hundred armed\nmen, who had been with him from his first flight in the days of Saul. But\nhe persuaded Abiathar and Zadok, the high priests, who had determined to\ngo away with him, as also all the Levites, who were with the ark, to stay\nbehind, as hoping that God would deliver him without its removal; but he\ncharged them to let him know privately how all things went on; and he had\ntheir sons, Ahimmaz the son of Zadok, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar,\nfor faithful ministers in all things; but Ittai the Gitrite went out with\nhim whether David would let him or not, for he would .have persuaded him\nto stay, and on that account he appeared the more friendly to him. But\nas he was ascending the Mount of Olives barefooted, and all his company\nwere in tears, it was told him that Ahithophel was with Absalom, and was\nof his side. This hearing augmented his grief; and he besought God earnestly\nto alienate the mind of Absalom from Ahithophel, for he was afraid that\nhe should persuade him to follow his pernicious counsel, for he was a prudent\nman, and very sharp in seeing what was advantageous. When David was gotten\nupon the top of the mountain, he took a view of the city; and prayed to\nGod with abundance of tears, as having already lost his kingdom; and here\nit was that a faithful friend of his, whose name was Hushai, met him. When\nDavid saw him with his clothes rent, and having ashes all over his head,\nand in lamentation for the great change of affairs, he comforted him, and\nexhorted him to leave off grieving; nay, at length he besought him to go\nback to Absalom, and appear as one of his party, and to fish out the secretest\ncounsels of his mind, and to contradict the counsels of Ahithophel, for\nthat he could not do him so much good by being with him as he might\nby being with Absalom. So he was prevailed on by David, and left him, and\ncame to Jerusalem, whither Absalom himself came also a little while afterward."}, "When David was gone a little farther, there met him Ziba, the servant\nof Mephibosheth, (whom he had sent to take care of the possessions which\nhad been given him, as the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,) with a couple\nof asses, loaden with provisions, and desired him to take as much of them\nas he and his followers stood in need of. And when the king asked him where\nhe had left Mephibosheth, he said he had left him in Jerusalem, expecting\nto be chosen king in the present confusions, in remembrance of the benefits\nSaul had conferred upon them. At this the king had great indignation, and\ngave to Ziba all that he had formerly bestowed on Mephibosheth; for he\ndetermined that it was much fitter that he should have them than the other;\nat which Ziba greatly rejoiced.", "When David was at Bahurim, a place so called, there came out a kinsman\nof Saul's, whose name was Shimei, and threw stones at him, and gave him\nreproachful words; and as his friends stood about the king and protected\nhim, he persevered still more in his reproaches, and called him a bloody\nman, and the author of all sorts of mischief. He bade him also go out of\nthe land as ,an impure and accursed wretch; and he thanked God for depriving\nhim of his kingdom, and causing him to be punished for what injuries he\nhad done to his master [Saul], and this by the means of his own son. Now\nwhen they were all provoked against him, and angry at bin;, and particularly\nAbishai, who had a mind to kill Shimei, David restrained his anger. \"Let\nus not,\" said he, \"bring upon ourselves another fresh misfortune\nto those we have already, for truly I have not the least regard nor concern\nfor this dog that raves at me: I submit myself to God, by whose permission\nthis man treats me in such a wild manner; nor is it any wonder that I am\nobliged to undergo these abuses from him, while I experience the like from\nan impious son of my own; but perhaps God will have some commiseration\nupon us; if it be his will we shall overcome them.\" So he went on\nhis way without troubling himself with Shimei, who ran along the other\nside of the mountain, and threw out his abusive language plentifully.

But when Absalom said to him, \"How\ncomes this, that he who was so intimate a friend of my father's, and appeared\nfaithful to him in all things, is not with him now, but hath left him,\nand is come over to me?\" Hushai's answer was very pertinent and prudent;\nfor he said, \"We ought to follow God and the multitude of the people;\nwhile these, therefore, my lord and master, are with thee, it is fit that\nI should follow them, for thou hast received the kingdom from God. I will\ntherefore, if thou believest me to be thy friend, show the same fidelity\nand kindness to thee, which thou knowest I have shown to thy father; nor\nis there any reason to be in the least dissatisfied with the present state\nof affairs, for the kingdom is not transferred into another, but remains\nstill in the same family, by the son's receiving it after his father.\"\nThis speech persuaded Absalom, who before suspected Hushai. And now he\ncalled Ahithophel, and consulted with him what he ought to do: he persuaded\nhim to go in unto his father's concubines; for he said that \"by this\naction the people would believe that thy difference with thy father is\nirreconcilable, and will thence fight with great alacrity against thy father,\nfor hitherto they are afraid of taking up open enmity against him, out\nof an expectation that you will be reconciled again.\" Accordingly,\nAbsalom was prevailed on by this advice, and commanded his servants to\npitch him a tent upon the top of the royal palace, in the sight of the\nmultitude; and he went in and lay with his father's concubines.

Absalom was pleased with this advice,\nand called for Hushai, David's friend (for so did he style him); and informing\nhim of the opinion of Ahithophel, he asked, further, what was his opinion\nconcerning that matter. Now he was sensible that if Ahithophel's counsel\nwere followed, David would be in danger of being seized on, and slain;\nso he attempted to introduce a contrary opinion, and said, \"Thou art not\nunacquainted, O king, with the valor of thy father, and of those that are\nnow with him; that he hath made many wars, and hath always come off with\nvictory, though probably he now abides in the camp, for he is very skiliful\nin stratagems, and in foreseeing the deceitful tricks of his enemies; yet\nwill he leave his own soldiers in the evening, and will either hide himself\nin some valley, or will place an ambush at some rock; so that when our\narmy joins battle with him, his soldiers will retire for a little while,\nbut will come upon us again, as encouraged by the king's being near them;\nand in the mean time your father will show himself suddenly in the time\nof the battle, and will infuse courage into his own people when they are\nin danger, but bring consternation to thine.

And if thy father shall shut himself up in some city, and\nbear a siege, we will overthrow that city with machines of war, and by\nundermining it.\" When Hushai had said this, he obtained his point\nagainst Ahithophel, for his opinion was preferred by Absalom before the\nother's: however, it was no other than God \nwho made the counsel of Hushai appear best to the mind of Absalom."}, "So Hushai made haste to the high priests, Zadok and Abiathar, and\ntold them the opinion of Ahithophel, and his own, and that the resolution\nwas taken to follow this latter advice. He therefore bade them send to\nDavid, and tell him of it, and to inform him of the counsels that had been\ntaken; and to desire him further to pass quickly over Jordan, lest his\nson should change his mind, and make haste to pursue him, and so prevent\nhim, and seize upon him before he be in safety. Now the high priests had\ntheir sons concealed in a proper place out of the city, that they might\ncarry news to David of what was transacted. Accordingly, they sent a maid-servant,\nwhom they could trust, to them, to carry the news of Absalom's counsels,\nand ordered them to signify the same to David with all speed. So they made\nno excuse nor delay, but taking along with them their fathers' injunctions,\nbecause pious and faithful ministers, and judging that quickness and suddenness\nwas the best mark of faithful service, they made haste to meet with David.\nBut certain horsemen saw them when they were two furlongs from the city,\nand informed Absalom of them, who immediately sent some to take them; but\nwhen the sons of the high priest perceived this, they went out of the road,\nand betook themselves to a certain village; that village was called Bahurim;\nthere they desired a certain woman to hide them, and afford them security.\nAccordingly she let the young men down by a rope into a well, and laid\nfleeces of wool over them; and when those that pursued them came to her,\nand asked her whether she saw them, she did not deny that she had seen\nthem, for that they staid with her some time, but she said they then went\ntheir ways; and she foretold that, however, if they would follow them directly,\nthey would catch them; but when after a long pursuit they could not catch\nthem, they came back again; and when the woman saw those men were returned,\nand that there was no longer any fear of the young men's being caught by\nthem, she drew them up by the rope, and bade them go on their journey accordingly,\nthey used great diligence in the prosecution of that journey, and came\nto David, and informed him accurately of all the counsels of Absalom.

Now, as for David, he passed over Jordan, as we have said already,\nand came to Mahanaim, every fine and very strong city; and all the chief\nmen of the country received him with great pleasure, both out of the shame\nthey had that he should be forced to flee away [from Jerusalem], and out\nof the respect they bare him while he was in his former prosperity. These\nwere Barzillai the Gileadite, and Siphar the ruler among the Ammonites,\nand Machir the principal man of Gilead; and these furnished him with plentiful\nprovisions for himself and his followers, insomuch that they wanted no\nbeds nor blankets for them, nor loaves of bread, nor wine; nay, they brought\nthem a great many cattle for slaughter, and afforded them what furniture\nthey wanted for their refreshment when they were weary, and for food, with\nplenty of other necessaries.", "AND this was the state of David and his followers: but Absalom got\ntogether a vast army of the Hebrews to oppose his father, and passed therewith\nover the river Jordan, and sat down not far off Mahanaim, in the country\nof Gilead. He appointed Amasa to be captain of all his host, instead of\nJoab his kinsman: his father was Ithra and his mother Abigail: now she\nand Zeruiah, the mother of Joab, were David's sisters. But when David had\nnumbered his followers, and found them to be about four thousand, he resolved\nnot to tarry till Absalom attacked him, but set over his men captains of\nthousands, and captains of hundreds, and divided his army into three parts;\nthe one part he committed to Joab, the next to Abishai, Joab's brother,\nand the third to Ittai, David's companion and friend, but one that came\nfrom the city Gath; and when he was desirous of fighting himself among\nthem, his friends would not let him: and this refusal of theirs was founded\nupon very wise reasons: \"For,\" said they, \"if we be conquered\nwhen he is with us, we have lost all good hopes of recovering ourselves;\nbut if we should be beaten in one part of our army, the other parts may\nretire to him, and may thereby prepare a greater force, while the enemy\nwill naturally suppose that he hath another army with him.\" So David\nwas pleased with this their advice, and resolved himself to tarry at Mahanaim;\nand as he sent his friends and commanders to the battle, he desired them\nto show all possible alacrity and fidelity, and to bear in mind what advantages\nthey had received from him, which, though they had not been very great,\nyet had they not been quite inconsiderable; and he begged of them to spare\nthe young man Absalom, lest some mischief should befall himself, if he\nshould be killed; and thus did he send out his army to the battle, and\nwished them victory therein.", "Then did Joab put his army in battle-array over against the enemy\nin the Great Plain, where he had a wood behind him. Absalom also brought\nhis army into the field to oppose him. Upon the joining of the battle,\nboth sides showed great actions with their hands and their boldness; the\none side exposing themselves to the greatest hazards, and using their utmost\nalacrity, that David might recover his kingdom; and the other being no\nway deficient, either in doing or suffering, that Absalom might not be\ndeprived of that kingdom, and be brought to punishment by his father for\nhis impudent attempt against him. Those also that were the most numerous\nwere solicitous that they might not be conquered by those few that were\nwith Joab, and with the other commanders, because that would be the greater\ndisgrace to them; while David's soldiers strove greatly to overcome so\nmany ten thousands as the enemy had with them. Now David's men were conquerors,\nas superior in strength and skill in war; so they followed the others as\nthey fled away through the forests and valleys; some they took prisoners,\nand many they slew, and more in the flight than in the battle for there\nfell about twenty thousand that day. But all David's men ran violently\nupon Absalom, for he was easily known by his beauty and tallness. He was\nhimself also afraid lest his enemies should seize on him, so he got upon\nthe king's mule, and fled; but as he was carried with violence, and noise,\nand a great motion, as being himself light, he entangled his hair greatly\nin the large boughs of a knotty tree that spread a great way, and there\nhe hung, after a surprising manner; and as for the beast, it went\non farther, and that swiftly, as if his master had been still upon his\nback; but he, hanging in the air upon the boughs, was taken by his enemies.\nNow when one of David's soldiers saw this, he informed Joab of it; and\nwhen the general said, that if he had shot at and killed Absalom, he would\nhave given him fifty shekels, - he replied, \"I would not have killed\nmy master's son if thou wouldst have given me a thousand shekels, especially\nwhen he desired that the young man might be spared in the hearing of us\nall.\" But Joab bade him show him where it was that he saw Absalom\nhang; whereupon he shot him to the heart, and slew him, and Joab's armor-bearers\nstood round the tree, and pulled down his dead body, and cast it into a\ngreat chasm that was out of sight, and laid a heap of stones upon him,\ntill the cavity was filled up, and had both the appearance and the bigness\nof a grave. Then Joab sounded a retreat, and recalled his own soldiers\nfrom pursuing the enemy's army, in order to spare their countrymen.", "Now Absalom had erected for himself a marble pillar in the king's\ndale, two furlongs distant from Jerusalem, which he named Absalom's Hand,\nsaying, that if his children were killed, his name would remain by that\npillar; for he had three sons and one daughter, named Tamar, as we said\nbefore, who when she was married to David's grandson, Rehoboam, bare a\nson, Abijah by name, who succeeded his father in the kingdom; but of these\nwe shall speak in a part of our history which will be more proper.

But\nwhen Cushi was come, and had worshipped him, and informed him of the victory,\nhe asked him about his son, who replied, \"May the like misfortune\nbefall thine enemies as hath befallen Absalom.\" That word did not\npermit either himself or his soldiers to rejoice for the victory, though\nit was a very great one; but David went up to the highest part of the city,\n and\nwept for his son, and beat his breast, tearing [the hair of] his head,\ntormenting himself all manner of ways, and crying out, \"O my son!\nI wish that I had died myself, and ended my days with thee! for\nhe was of a tender natural affection, and had extraordinary compassion\nfor this son in particular. But when the army and Joab heard that the king\nmourned for his son, they were ashamed to enter the city in the habit of\nconquerors, but they all came in as cast down, and in tears, as if they\nhad been beaten. Now while the king covered himself, and grievously lamented\nhis son, Joab went in to him, and comforted him, and said, \"O my lord\nthe king, thou art not aware that thou layest a blot on thyself by what\nthou now doest; for thou seemest to hate those that love thee, and undergo\ndangers for thee nay, to hate thyself and thy family, and to love those\nthat are thy bitter enemies, and to desire the company of those that are\nno more, and who have been justly slain; for had Absalom gotten the victory,\nand firmly settled himself in the kingdom, there had been none of us left\nalive, but all of us, beginning with thyself and thy children, had miserably\nperished, while our enemies had not wept for his, but rejoiced over usand punished even those that pitied us in our misfortunes; and thou\nart not ashamed to do this in the case of one that has been thy bitter\nenemy, who, while he was thine own son hath proved so wicked to thee. Leave\noff, therefore, thy unreasonable grief, and come abroad and be seen of\nthy soldiers, and return them thanks for the alacrity they showed in the\nfight; for I myself will this day persuade the people to leave thee, and\nto give the kingdom to another, if thou continuest to do thus; and then\nI shall make thee to grieve bitterly and in earnest.\" Upon Joab's\nspeaking thus to him, he made the king leave off his sorrow, and brought\nhim to the consideration of his affairs. So David changed his habit, and\nexposed himself in a manner fit to be seen by the multitude, and sat at\nthe gates; whereupon all the people heard of it, and ran together to him,\nand saluted him. And this was the present state of David's affairs."}, "NOW those Hebrews that had been With Absalom, and had retired out\nof the battle, when they were all returned home, sent messengers to every\ncity to put them in mind of what benefits David had bestowed upon them,\nand of that liberty which he had procured them, by delivering them from\nmany and great wars. But they complained, that whereas they had ejected\nhim out of his kingdom, and committed it to another governor, which other\ngovernor, whom they had set up, was already dead, they did not now beseech\nDavid to leave off his anger at them, and to become friends with them,\nand, as he used to do, to resume the care of their affairs, and take the\nkingdom again. This was often told to David. And, this notwithstanding,\nDavid sent to Zadok and Abiathar the high priests, that they should speak\nto the rulers of the tribe of Judah after the manner following: That it\nwould be a reproach upon them to permit the other tribes to choose David\nfor their king before their tribe, \"and this,\" said he, \"while\nyou are akin to him, and of the same common blood.\" He commanded them\nalso to say the same to Amasa the captain of their forces, That whereas\nhe was his sister's son, he had not persuaded the multitude to restore\nthe kingdom to David; that he might expect from him not only a reconciliation,\nfor that was already granted, but that supreme command of the army also\nwhich Absalom had bestowed upon him. Accordingly the high priests, when\nthey had discoursed with the rulers of the tribe, and said what the king\nhad ordered them, persuaded Amasa to undertake the care of his affairs.\nSo he persuaded that tribe to send immediately ambassadors to him, to beseech\nhim to return to his own kingdom. The same did all the Israelites, at the\nlike persuasion of Amasa.", "When the ambassadors came to him, he came to Jerusalem; and the tribe\nof Judah was the first that came to meet the king at the river Jordan.\nAnd Shimei, the son of Gera, came with a thousand men, which he brought\nwith him out of the tribe of Benjamin; and Ziba, the freed-man of Saul,\nwith his sons, fifteen in number, and with his twenty servants.

While he was thus entreating\nthe king, and moving him to compassion, Abishai, Joab's brother, said,\n\"And shall not this man die for this, that he hath cursed that king\nwhom God hath appointed to reign over us?\" But David turned himself\nto him, and said, \"Will you never leave off, ye sons of Zeruiah? Do\nnot you, I pray, raise new troubles and seditions among us, now the former\nare over; for I would not have you ignorant that I this day begin my reign,\nand therefore swear to remit to all offenders their punishments, and not\nto animadvert on any one that has sinned.

Now he had been unjustly calumniated\nto the king by Ziba, his steward. When he had saluted the king, and worshipped\nhim, the king began to ask him why he did not go out of Jerusalem with\nhim, and accompany him during his flight.

When he entreated for this so earnestly, the king said, \"I\ndismiss thee, but thou shalt grant me thy son Chimham, and upon him I will\nbestow all sorts of good things.\" So Barzillai left his son with him,\nand worshipped the king, and wished him a prosperous conclusion of all\nhis affairs according to his own mind, and then returned home; but David\ncame to Gilgal, having about him half the people [of Israel], and the [whole]\ntribe of Judah.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "I clearly prefer Josephus's reading here, when it supposes eleven tribes,\nincluding Benjamin, to be on the one side, and the tribe of Judah alone\non the other, since Benjamin, in general, had been still father of the\nhouse of Saul, and less firm to David hitherto, than any of the rest, and\nso cannot be supposed to be joined with Judah at this time, to make it\ndouble, especially when the following rebellion was headed by a Benjamite.\nSee sect. 6, and 2 Samuel 20:2, 4."}, "#text": "Now the principal men of the country came to Gilgal to him with a\ngreat multitude, and complained of the tribe of Judah, that they had come\nto him in a private manner; whereas they ought all conjointly, and with\none and the same intention, to have given him the meeting. But the rulers\nof the tribe of Judah desired them not to be displeased, if they had been\nprevented by them; for, said they, \"We are David's kinsmen, and on\nthat account we the rather took care of him, and loved him, and. so came\nfirst to him;\" yet had they not, by their early coming, received any\ngifts from him, which might give them who came last any uneasiness. When\nthe rulers of the tribe of Judah had said this, the rulers of the other\ntribes were not quiet, but said further, \"O brethren, we cannot but\nwonder at you when you call the king your kinsman alone, whereas he that\nhath received from God the power over all of us in common ought to be esteemed\na kinsman to us all; for which reason the whole people have eleven parts\nin him, and you but one part \nwe are also elder than you; wherefore you have not done justly in coming\nto the king in this private and concealed manner.\""}, "While these rulers were thus disputing one with another,. a certain\nwicked man, who took a pleasure in seditious practices, (his name was Sheba,\nthe son of Bichri, of the tribe of Benjamin,) stood up in the midst of\nthe multitude, and cried aloud, and spake thus to them: \"We have no\npart in David, nor inheritance in the son of Jesse.\" And when he had\nused those words, he blew with a trumpet, and declared war against the\nking; and they all left David, and followed him; the tribe of Judah alone\nstaid with him, and settled him in his royal palace at Jerusalem. But as\nfor his concubines, with whom Absalom his son had accompanied, truly he\nremoved them to another house, and ordered those that had the care of them\nto make a plentiful provision for them, but he came not near them any more.\nHe also appointed Amass for the captain of his forces, and gave him the\nsame high office which Joab before had; and he commanded him to gather\ntogether, out of the tribe of Judah, as great an army as he could, and\ncome to him within three days, that he might deliver to him his entire\narmy, and might send him to fight against [Sheba] the son of Bichri. Now\nwhile Amass was gone out, and made some delay in gathering the army together,\nand so was not yet returned, on the third day the king said to Joab, \"It\nis not fit we should make any delay in this affair of Sheba, lest he get\na numerous army about him, and be the occasion of greater mischief, and\nhurt our affairs more than did Absalom himself; do not thou therefore wait\nany longer, but take such forces as thou hast at hand, and that [old] body\nof six hundred men, and thy brother Abishai, with thee, and pursue after\nour enemy, and endeavor to fight him wheresoever thou canst overtake him.\nMake haste to prevent him, lest he seize upon some fenced cities, and cause\nus great labor and pains before we take him.\"", "So Joab resolved to make no delay, but taking with him his brother,\nand those six hundred men, and giving orders that the rest of the army\nwhich was at Jerusalem should follow him, he marched with great speed against\nSheba; and when he was come to Gibeon, which is a village forty furlongs\ndistant from Jerusalem, Amasa brought a great army with him, and met Joab.\nNow Joab was girded with a sword, and his breastplate on; and when Amasa\ncame near him to salute him, he took particular care that his sword should\nfall out, as it were, of its own accord: so he took it up from the ground,\nand while he approached Amasa, who was then near him, as though he would\nkiss him, he took hold of Amasa's beard with his other hand, and he smote\nhim in his belly when he did not foresee it, and slew him. This impious\nand altogether profane action Joab did to a good young man, and his kinsman,\nand one that had done him no injury, and this out of jealousy that he would\nobtain the chief command of the army, and be in equal dignity with himself\nabout the king; and for the same cause it was that he killed Abner. But\nas to that former wicked action, the death of his brother Asahel, which\nhe seemed to revenge, afforded him a decent pretense, and made that crime\na pardonable one; but in this murder of Amasa there was no such covering\nfor it. Now when Joab had killed this general, he pursued after Sheba,\nhaving left a man with the dead body, who was ordered to proclaim aloud\nto the army, that Amasa was justly slain, and deservedly punished. \"But,\"\nsaid he, \"if you be for the king, follow Joab his general, and Abishai,\nJoab's brother:\" but because the body lay on the road, and all the\nmultitude came running to it, and, as is usual with the multitude, stood\nwondering a great while at it, he that guarded it removed it thence, and\ncarried it to a certain place that was very remote from the road, and there\nlaid it, and covered it with his garment. When this was done, all the people\nfollowed Joab. Now as he pursued Sheba through all the country of Israel,\none told him that he was in a strong city, called Abelbeth-maachah. Hereupon\nJoab went thither, and set about it with his army, and cast up a bank round\nit, and ordered his soldiers to undermine the walls, and to overthrow them;\nand since the people in the city did not admit him, he was greatly displeased\nat them.", "Now there was a woman of small account, and yet both wise and intelligent,\nwho seeing her native city lying at the last extremity, ascended upon the\nwall, and, by means of the armed men, called for Joab; and when he came\nto her, she began to say, That \"God ordained kings and generals\nof armies, that they might cut off the enemies of the Hebrews, and introduce\na universal peace among them; but thou art endeavoring to overthrow and\ndepopulate a metropolis of the Israelites, which hath been guilty of no\noffense.\" But he replied, \"God continue to be merciful unto me:\nI am disposed to avoid killing any one of the people, much less would I\ndestroy such a city as this; and if they will deliver me up Sheba, the\nson of Bichri, who hath rebelled against the king, I will leave off the\nsiege, and withdraw the army from the place.\" Now as soon as the woman\nheard what Joab said, she desired him to intermit the siege for a little\nwhile, for that he should have the head of his enemy thrown out to him\npresently. So she went down to the citizens, and said to them, \"Will\nyou be so wicked as to perish miserably, with your children and wives,\nfor the sake of a vile fellow, and one whom nobody knows who he is? And\nwill you have him for your king instead of David, who hath been so great\na benefactor to you, and oppose your city alone to such a mighty and strong\narmy?\" So she prevailed with them, and they cut off the head of Sheba,\nand threw it into Joab's army. When this was done, the king's general sounded\na retreat, and raised the siege. And when he was come to Jerusalem, he\nwas again appointed to be general of all the people. The king also constituted\nBenaiah captain of the guards, and of the six hundred men. He also set\nAdoram over the tribute, and Sabathes and Achilaus over the records. He\nmade Sheva the scribe, and appointed Zadok and Abiathar the high priests.", "AFTER this, when the country was greatly afflicted with a famine,\nDavid besought God to have mercy on the people, and to discover to him\nwhat was the cause of it, and how a remedy might be found for that distemper.\nAnd when the prophets answered, that God would have the Gibeonites avenged\nwhom Saul the king was so wicked as to betray to slaughter, and had not\nobserved the oath which Joshua the general and the senate had sworn to\nthem: If, therefore, said God, the king would permit such vengeance to\nbe taken for those that were slain as the Gibeonites should desire, he\npromised that he would be reconciled to them, and free the multitude from\ntheir miseries. As soon therefore as the king understood that this it was\nwhich God sought, he sent for the Gibeonites, and asked them what it was\nthey should have; and when they desired to have seven sons of Saul delivered\nto them to be punished, he delivered them up, but spared Mephibosheth the\nson of Jonathan. So when the Gibeonites had received the men, they punished\nthem as they pleased; upon which God began to send rain, and to recover\nthe earth to bring forth its fruits as usual, and to free it from the foregoing\ndrought, so that the country of the Hebrews flourished again. A little\nafterward the king made war against the Philistines; and when he had joined\nbattle with them, and put them to flight, he was left alone, as he was\nin pursuit of them; and when he was quite tired down, he was seen by one\nof the enemy, his name was Achmon, the son of Araph, he was one of the\nsons of the giants. He had a spear, the handle of which weighed three hundred\nshekels, and a breastplate of chain-work, and a sword. He turned back,\nand ran violently to slay [David] their enemy's king, for he was quite\ntired out with labor; but Abishai, Joab's brother, appeared on the sudden,\nand protected the king with his shield, as he lay down, and slew the enemy.\nNow the multitude were very uneasy at these dangers of the king, and that\nhe was very near to be slain; and the rulers made him swear that he would\nno more go out with them to battle, lest he should come to some great misfortune\nby his courage and boldness, and thereby deprive the people of the benefits\nthey now enjoyed by his means, and of those that they might hereafter enjoy\nby his living a long time among them.", "When the king heard that the Philistines were gathered together at\nthe city Gazara, he sent an army against them, when Sibbechai the Hittite,\none of David's most courageous men, behaved himself so as to deserve great\ncommendation, for he slew many of those that bragged they were the posterity\nof the giants, and vaunted themselves highly on that account, and thereby\nwas the occasion of victory to the Hebrews. After which defeat, the Philistines\nmade war again; and when David had sent an army against them, Nephan his\nkinsman fought in a single combat with the stoutest of all the Philistines,\nand slew him, and put the rest to flight. Many of them also were slain\nin the fight. Now a little while after this, the Philistines pitched their\ncamp at a city which lay not far off the bounds of the country of the Hebrews.\nThey had a man who was six cubits tall, and had on each of his feet and\nhands one more toe and finger than men naturally have. Now the person who\nwas sent against them by David out of his army was Jonathan, the son of\nShimea, who fought this man in a single combat, and slew him; and as he\nwas the person who gave the turn to the battle, he gained the greatest\nreputation for courage therein. This man also vaunted himself to be of\nthe sons of the giants.

II. ch. 16. sect. 4."}, "emph": ["trimeters", "pentameters"], "#text": "And now David being freed from wars and dangers, and enjoying for\nthe future a profound peace, \ncomposed songs and hymns to God of several sorts of metre; some of those\nwhich he made were , and some were . He\nalso made instruments of music, and taught the Levites to sing hymns to\nGod, both on that called the sabbath day, and on other festivals. Now the\nconstruction of the instruments was thus: The viol was an instrument of\nten strings, it was played upon with a bow; the psaltery had twelve musical\nnotes, and was played upon by the fingers; the cymbals were broad and large\ninstruments, and were made of brass. And so much shall suffice to be spoken\nby us about these instruments, that the readers may not be wholly unacquainted\nwith their nature."}, "Now all the men that were about David were men of courage. Those\nthat were most illustrious and famous of them for their actions were thirty-eight;\nof five of whom I will only relate the performances, for these will suffice\nto make manifest the virtues of the others also; for these were powerful\nenough to subdue countries, and conquer great nations. First, therefore,\nwas Jessai, the son of Achimaas, who frequently leaped upon the troops\nof the enemy, and did not leave off fighting till he overthrew nine hundred\nof them. After him was Eleazar, the son of Dodo, who was with the king\nat Arasam. This man, when once the Israelites were under a consternation\nat the multitude of the Philistines, and were running away, stood alone,\nand fell upon the enemy, and slew many of them, till his sword clung to\nhis band by the blood he had shed, and till the Israelites, seeing the\nPhilistines retire by his means, came down from the mountains and pursued\nthem, and at that time won a surprising and a famous victory, while Eleazar\nslew the men, and the multitude followed and spoiled their dead bodies.\nThe third was Sheba, the son of Ilus. Now this man, when, in the wars against\nthe Philistines, they pitched their camp at a place called Lehi, and when\nthe Hebrews were again afraid of their army, and did not stay, he stood\nstill alone, as an army and a body of men; and some of them he overthrew,\nand some who were not able to abide his strength and force he pursued.\nThese are the works of the hands, and of fighting, which these three performed.\nNow at the time when the king was once at Jerusalem, and the army of the\nPhilistines came upon him to fight him, David went up to the top of the\ncitadel, as we have already said, to inquire of God concerning the battle,\nwhile the enemy's camp lay in the valley that extends to the city Bethlehem,\nwhich is twenty furlongs distant from Jerusalem. Now David said to his\ncompanions, \"We have excellent water in my own city, especially that\nwhich is in the pit near the gate,\" wondering if any one would bring\nhim some of it to drink; but he said that he would rather have it than\na great deal of money. When these three men heard what he said, they ran\naway immediately, and burst through the midst of their enemy's camp, and\ncame to Bethlehem; and when they had drawn the water, they returned again\nthrough the enemy's camp to the king, insomuch that the Philistines were\nso surprised at their boldness and alacrity, that they were quiet, and\ndid nothing against them, as if they despised their small number. But when\nthe water was brought to the king, he would not drink it, saying, that\nit was brought by the danger and the blood of men, and that it was not\nproper on that account to drink it. But he poured it out to God, and gave\nhim thanks for the salvation of the men. Next to these was Abishai, Joab's\nbrother; for he in one day slew six hundred. The fifth of these was Benaiah,\nby lineage a priest; for being challenged by [two] eminent men in the country\nof Moab, he overcame them by his valor, Moreover, there was a man, by nation\nan Egyptian, who was of a vast bulk, and challenged him, yet did he, when\nhe was unarmed, kill him with his own spear, which he threw at him; for\nhe caught him by force, and took away his weapons while he was alive and\nfighting, and slew him with his own weapons. One may also add this to the\nforementioned actions of the same man, either as the principal of them\nin alacrity, or as resembling the rest. When God sent a snow, there was\na lion who slipped and fell into a certain pit, and because the pit's mouth\nwas narrow it was evident he would perish, being enclosed with the snow;\nso when he saw no way to get out and save himself, he roared. When Benaiah\nheard the wild beast, he went towards him, and coming at the noise he made,\nhe went down into the mouth of the pit and smote him, as he struggled,\nwith a stake that lay there, and immediately slew him. The other thirty-three\nwere like these in valor also.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The words of God by Moses, Exodus 30:12, sufficiently satisfy the reason\nhere given by Josephus for the great plague mentioned in this chapter:\n \"When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their\nnumber, then shall they give a ransom for his soul unto the Lord, when\nthou numberest them; that there be no plague amongst them, when numberest\nthem.\" Nor indeed could David's or the neglect of executing this law\nat this numeration of half a shekel apiece with them, when they came numbered.\nThe great reason why nations are so committed by and with their wicked\nkings and governors that they almost constantly comply with them in their\nof or disobedience to the Divine laws, and suffer Divine laws to go into\ndisuse or contempt, in order to kings and governors; and that they sub-political\nlaws and commands of those governors, instead of the righteous laws of\nGod, which all mankind ought ever to obey, let their kings and governors\nsay what they please to the contrary; this preference of human before Divine\nlaws seeming to me the principal character of idolatrous or antichristian\nnations. Accordingly, Josephus well observes, Antiq. B. IV. ch. 8. sect.\n17, that it was the duty of the people of Israel to take care that their\nkings, when they should have them, did not exceed their proper limits of\npower, and prove ungovernable by the laws of God, which would certainly\nbe a most pernicious thing to their Divine settlement. Nor do I think that\nnegligence peculiar to the Jews: those nations which are called Christians,\nare sometimes indeed very solicitous to restrain their kings and governors\nfrom breaking the human laws of their several kingdoms, but without the\nlike care for restraining them from breaking the laws of God. \"Whether\nit be right in the sight of God to hearken unto men more than to God, judge\nye,\" Acts 4:19. \"We ought to obey God rather than men,\"\nver. 29."}, "#text": "NOW king David was desirous to know how many ten thousands there\nwere of the people, but forgot the commands of Moses, \nwho told them beforehand, that if the multitude were numbered, they should\npay half a shekel to God for every head. Accordingly the king commanded\nJoab, the captain of his host, to go and number the whole multitude; but\nwhen he said there was no necessity for such a numeration, he was not persuaded\n[to countermand it], but he enjoined him to make no delay, but to go about\nthe numbering of the Hebrews immediately. So Joab took with him the heads\nof the tribes, and the scribes, and went over the country of the Israelites,\nand took notice how numerous the multitude were, and returned to Jerusalem\nto the king, after nine months and twenty days; and he gave in to the king\nthe number of the people, without the tribe of Benjamin, for he had not\nyet numbered that tribe, no more than the tribe of Levi, for the king repented\nof his having sinned against God. Now the number of the rest of the Israelites\nwas nine hundred thousand men, who were able to bear arms and go to war;\nbut the tribe of Judah, by itself, was four hundred thousand men."}, "Now when the prophets had signified to David that God was angry at\nhim, he began to entreat him, and to desire he would be merciful to him,\nand forgive his sin. But God sent Nathan the prophet to him, to propose\nto him the election of three things, that he might choose which he liked\nbest: Whether he would have famine come upon the country for seven years,\nor would have a war, and be subdued three months by his enemies? or, whether\nGod should send a pestilence and a distemper upon the Hebrews for three\ndays? But as he was fallen to a fatal choice of great miseries, he was\nin trouble, and sorely confounded; and when the prophet had said that he\nmust of necessity make his choice, and had ordered him to answer quickly,\nthat he might declare what he had chosen to God, the king reasoned with\nhimself, that in case he should ask for famine, he would appear to do it\nfor others, and without danger to himself, since he had a great deal of\ncorn hoarded up, but to the harm of others; that in case he should choose\nto be overcome [by his enemies] for three months, he would appear to have\nchosen war, because he had valiant men about him, and strong holds, and\nthat therefore he feared nothing therefrom: so he chose that affliction\nwhich is common to kings and to their subjects, and in which the fear was\nequal on all sides; and said this beforehand, that it was much better to\nfall into the hands of God, than into those of his enemies.", "When the prophet had heard this, he declared it to God; who thereupon\nsent a pestilence and a mortality upon the Hebrews; nor did they die after\none and the same manner, nor so that it was easy to know what the distemper\nwas. Now the miserable disease was one indeed, but it carried them off\nby ten thousand causes and occasions, which those that were afflicted could\nnot understand; for one died upon the neck of another, and the terrible\nmalady seized them before they were aware, and brought them to their end\nsuddenly, some giving up the ghost immediately with very great pains and\nbitter grief, and some were worn away by their distempers, and had nothing\nremaining to be buried, but as soon as ever they fell were entirely macerated;\nsome were choked, and greatly lamented their case, as being also stricken\nwith a sudden darkness; some there were who, as they were burying a relation,\nfell down dead, without finishing the rites of the funeral. Now there perished\nof this disease, which began with the morning, and lasted till the hour\nof dinner, seventy thousand. Nay, the angel stretched out his hand over\nJerusalem, as sending this terrible judgment upon it. But David had put\non sackcloth, and lay upon the ground, entreating God, and begging that\nthe distemper might now cease, and that he would be satisfied with those\nthat had already perished. And when the king looked up into the air, and\nsaw the angel carried along thereby into Jerusalem, with his sword drawn,\nhe said to God, that he might justly be punished, who was their shepherd,\nbut that the sheep ought to be preserved, as not having sinned at all;\nand he implored God that he would send his wrath upon him, and upon all\nhis family, but spare the people.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "What Josephus adds here is very remarkable, that this Mount Moriah was\nnot only the very place where Abraham offered up Isaac long ago, but that\nGod had foretold to David by a prophet, that here his son should build\nhim a temple, which is not directly in any of our other copies, though\nvery agreeable to what is in them, particularly in 1 Chronicles 21:25,\n28; 22:1, to which places I refer the reader."}, "emph": "The Altar of all the People", "#text": "When God heard his supplication, he caused the pestilence to cease,\nand sent Gad the prophet to him, and commanded him to go up immediately\nto the thrashing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite, and build an altar there\nto God, and offer sacrifices. When David heard that, he did not neglect\nhis duty, but made haste to the place appointed him. Now Araunah was thrashing\nwheat; and when he saw the king and all his servants coming to him, he\nran before, and came to him and worshipped him: he was by his lineage a\nJebusite, but a particular friend of David's; and for that cause it was\nthat, when he overthrew the city, he did him no harm, as we informed the\nreader a little before. Now Araunah inquired, \"Wherefore\nis my lord come to his servant?\" He answered, to buy of him the\nthrashing-floor, that he might therein build an altar to God, and offer\na sacrifice. He replied, that he freely gave him both the thrashing-floor\nand the ploughs and the oxen for a burnt-offering; and he besought God\ngraciously to accept his sacrifice. But the king made answer, that he took\nhis generosity and magnanimity loudly, and accepted his good-will, but\nhe desired him to take the price of them all, for that it was not just\nto offer a sacrifice that cost nothing. And when Araunah said he would\ndo as he pleased, he bought the thrashing-floor of him for fifty shekels.\nAnd when he had built an altar, he performed Divine service, and brought\na burnt-offering, and offered peace-offerings also. With these God was\npacified, and became gracious to them again. Now it happened that\nAbraham came\nand offered his son Isaac for a burnt-offering at that very place; and\nwhen the youth was ready to have his throat cut, a ram appeared on a sudden,\nstanding by the altar, which Abraham sacrificed in the stead of his son,\nas we have before related. Now when king David saw that God had heard his\nprayer, and had graciously accepted of his sacrifice, he resolved\nto call that entire place , and to build\na temple to God there; which words he uttered very appositely to what was\nto be done afterward; for God sent the prophet to him, and told him that\nthere should his son build him an altar, that son who was to take the kingdom\nafter him."}, "AFTER the delivery of this prophecy, the king commanded the strangers\nto be numbered; and they were found to be one hundred and eighty thousand;\nof these he appointed fourscore thousand to be hewers of stone, and the\nrest of the multitude to carry the stones, and of them he set over the\nworkmen three thousand and five hundred. He also prepared a great quantity\nof iron and brass for the work, with many (and those exceeding large) cedar\ntrees; the Tyrians and Sidonians sending them to him, for he had sent to\nthem for a supply of those trees. And he told his friends that these things\nwere now prepared, that he might leave materials ready for the building\nof the temple to his son, who was to reign after him, and that he might\nnot have them to seek then, when he was very young, and by reason of his\nage unskillful in such matters, but might have them lying by him, and so\nmight the more readily complete the work.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Of the quantity of gold and silver expended in the building of Solomon's\ntemple, and whence it arose, see the description of ch. 13."}, "#text": "So David called his son Solomon, and charged him, when he had received\nthe kingdom, to build a temple to God, and said, \"!I was willing to\nbuild God a temple myself, but he prohibited me, because I was polluted\nwith blood and wars; but he hath foretold that Solomon, my youngest son,\nshould build him a temple, and should be called by that name; over whom\nhe hath promised to take the like care as a father takes over his son;\nand that he would make the country of the Hebrews happy under him, and\nthat, not only in other respects, but by giving it peace and freedom from\nwars, and from internal seditions, which are the greatest of all blessings.\nSince, therefore,\" says he, \"thou wast ordained king by God himself\nbefore thou wast born, endeavor to render thyself worthy of this his providence,\nas in other instances, so particularly in being religious, and righteous,\nand courageous. Keep thou also his commands and his laws, which he hath\ngiven us by Moses, and do not permit others to break them.

Wherefore, if thou performest\nthis work, thou wilt be acceptable to God, and have him for thy patron.\"\nDavid also further exhorted the rulers of the people to assist his son\nin this building, and to attend to the Divine service, when they should\nbe free from all their misfortunes, for that they by this means should\nenjoy, instead of them, peace and a happy settlement, with which blessings\nGod rewards such men as are religious and righteous. He also gave orders,\nthat when the temple should be once built, they should put the ark therein,\nwith the holy vessels; and he assured them that they ought to have had\na temple long ago, if their fathers had not been negligent of God's commands,\nwho had given it in charge, that when they had got the possession of this\nland, they should build him a temple. Thus did David discourse to the governors,\nand to his son."}, "David was now in years, and his body, by length of time, was become\ncold, and benumbed, insomuch that he could get no heat by covering himself\nwith many clothes; and when the physicians came together, they agreed to\nthis advice, that a beautiful virgin, chosen out of the whole country,\nshould sleep by the king's side, and that this damsel would communicate\nheat to him, and be a remedy against his numbness. Now there was found\nin the city one woman, of a superior beauty to all other women, (her name\nwas Abishag,) who, sleeping with the king, did no more than communicate\nwarmth to him, for he was so old that he could not know her as a husband\nknows his wife. But of this woman we shall speak more presently.", "Now the fourth son of David was a beautiful young man, and tall,\nborn to him of Haggith his wife. He was named Adonijah, and was in his\ndisposition like to Absalom; and exalted himself as hoping to be king,\nand told his friends that he ought to take the government upon him. He\nalso prepared many chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.\nWhen his father saw this, he did not reprove him, nor restrain him from\nhis purpose, nor did he go so far as to ask wherefore he did so. Now Adonijah\nhad for his assistants Joab the captain of the army, and Abiathar the high\npriest; and the only persons that opposed him were Zadok the high priest,\nand the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah, who was captain of the guards, and\nShimei, David's friend, with all the other most mighty men. Now Adonijah\nhad prepared a supper out of the city, near the fountain that was in the\nking's paradise, and had invited all his brethren except Solomon, and had\ntaken with him Joab the captain of the army, and: Abiathar, and the rulers\nof the tribe of Judah, but had not invited to this feast either Zadok the\nhigh priest, or Nathan the prophet, or Benaiah the captain of the guards,\nnor any of those of the contrary party. This matter was told by Nathan\nthe prophet to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, that Adonijah was king, and\nthat David knew nothing of it; and he advised her to save herself and her\nson Solomon, and to go by herself to David, and say to him, that he had\nindeed sworn that Solomon should reign after him, but that in the mean\ntime Adonijah had already taken the kingdom. He said that he, the prophet\nhimself, would come after her, and when she had spoken thus to the king,\nwould confirm what she had said. Accordingly Bathsheba agreed with Nathan,\nand went in to the king and worshipped him, and when she had desired leave\nto speak with him, she told him all things in the manner that Nathan had\nsuggested to her; and related what a supper Adonijah had made, and who\nthey were whom he had invited; Abiathar the and Joab the general, and David's\nsons, excepting Solomon and his intimate friends. She also said that all\nthe people had their eyes upon him, to know whom he would choose for their\nking. She desired him also to consider how, after his departure, Adonijah,\nif he were king, would slay her and her son Solomon.", "Now, as Bathsheba was speaking, the keeper of the king's chambers\ntold him that Nathan desired to see him. And when the king had commanded\nthat he should be admitted, he came in, and asked him whether he had ordained\nAdonijah to be king, and delivered the government to him, or not; for that\nhe had made a splendid supper, and invited all his sons, except Solomon;\nas also that he had invited Joab, the captain of his host, [and Abiathar\nthe high priest,] who are feasting with applauses, and many joyful sounds\nof instruments, and wish that his kingdom may last for ever; but he hath\nnot invited me, nor Zadok the high priest, nor Benaiah the captain\nof the guards; and it is but fit that all should know whether this be done\nby thy approbation or not. When Nathan had said thus, the king commanded\nthat they should call Bathsheba to him, for she had gone out of the room\nwhen the prophet came. And when Bathsheba was come, David said, \"I\nswear by Almighty God, that thy son Solomon shall certainly he king, as\nI formerly swore; and that he shall sit upon my throne, and that this very\nday also.\" So Bathsheba worshipped him, and wished him a long life;\nand the king sent for Zadok the high priest, and Benaiah the captain of\nthe guards; and when they were come, he ordered them to take with them\nNathan the prophet, and all the armed men about the palace, and to set\nhis son Solomon upon the king's mule, and to carry him out of the city\nto the fountain called Gihon, and to anoint him there with the holy oil,\nand to make him king. This he charged Zadok the high priest, and Nathan\nthe prophet, to do, and commanded them to follow Solomon through the midst\nof the city, and to sound the trumpets, and wish aloud that Solomon the\nking may sit upon the royal throne for ever, that so all the people may\nknow that he is ordained king by his father. He also gave Solomon a charge\nconcerning his government, to rule the whole nation of the Hebrews, and\nparticularly the tribe of Judah, religiously and righteously. And when\nBenaiah had prayed to God to be favorable to Solomon, without any delay\nthey set Solomon upon the mule, and brought him out of the city to the\nfountain, and anointed him with oil, and brought him into the city again,\nwith acclamations and wishes that his kingdom might continue a long time:\nand when they had introduced him into the king's house, they set him upon\nthe throne; whereupon all the people betook themselves to make merry, and\nto celebrate a festival, dancing and delighting themselves with musical\npipes, till both the earth and the air echoed with the multitude of the\ninstruments of music.", "Now when Adonijah and his guests perceived this noise, they were\nin disorder; and Joab the captain of the host said he was not pleased with\nthese echoes, and the sound of these trumpets. And when supper was set\nbefore them, nobody tasted of it, but they were all very thoughtful what\nwould be the matter. Then Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the high priest,\ncame running to them; and when Adonijah saw the young man gladly, and said\nto him that he was a good messenger, he declared to them the whole matter\nabout Solomon, and the determination of king David: hereupon both Adonijah\nand all the guests rose hastily from the feast, and every one fled to their\nown homes. Adonijah also, as afraid of the king for what he had done, became\na supplicant to God, and took hold of the horns of the altar, which were\nprominent. It was also told Solomon that he had so done; and that he desired\nto receive assurances from him that he would not remember the injury he\nhad done, and not inflict any severe punishment for it. Solomon answered\nvery mildly and prudently, that he forgave him this his offense; but said\nwithal, that if he were found out in any attempt for new innovations, that\nhe would be the author of his own punishment. So he sent to him, and raised\nhim up from the place of his supplication. And when he was come to the\nking, and had worshipped him, the king bid him go away to his own house,\nand have no suspicion of any harm; and desired him to show himself a worthy\nman, as what would tend to his own advantage.", "But David, being desirous of ordaining his son king of all the people,\ncalled together their rulers to Jerusalem, with the priests and the Levites;\nand having first numbered the Levites, he found them to be thirty-eight\nthousand, from thirty years old to fifty; out of which he appointed twenty-three\nthousand to take care of the building of the temple, and out of the same,\nsix thousand to be judges of the people and scribes, four thousand for\nporters to the house of God, and as many for singers, to sing to the instruments\nwhich David had prepared, as we have said already. He divided them also\ninto courses: and when he had separated the priests from them, he found\nof these priests twenty-four courses, sixteen of the house of Eleazar,\nand eight of that of Ithamar; and he ordained that one course should minister\nto God eight days, from sabbath to sabbath. And thus were the courses distributed\nby lot, in the presence of David, and Zadok and Abiathar the high priests,\nand of all the rulers; and that course which came up first was written\ndown as the first, and accordingly the second, and so on to the twenty-fourth;\nand this partition hath remained to this day. He also made twenty-four\nparts of the tribe of Levi; and when they cast lots, they came up in the\nsame manner for their courses of eight days. He also honored the posterity\nof Moses, and made them the keepers of the treasures of God, and of the\ndonations which the kings dedicated.

He also set rulers over every part, such as he knew to be\ngood and righteous men. He set others also to take charge of the treasures,\nand of the villages, and of the fields, and of the beasts, whose names\nI do not think it necessary to mention. When David had ordered all these\nofficers after the manner before mentioned, he called the rulers of the\nHebrews, and their heads of tribes, and the officers over the several divisions,\nand those that were appointed over every work, and every possession; and\nstanding upon a high pulpit, he said to the multitude as follows: \"My\nbrethren and my people, I would have you know that I intended to build\na house for God, and prepared a large quantity of gold, and a hundred thousand\ntalents of silver; but God prohibited me by the prophet Nathan, because\nof the wars I had on your account, and because my right hand was polluted\nwith the slaughter of our enemies; but he commanded that my son, who was\nto succeed me in the kingdom, should build a temple for him.

And I pray that the promises of God may be fulfilled; and\nthat this happiness which he hath promised to bestow upon king Solomon,\nover all the country, may continue therein for all time to come. And these\npromises O son, will be firm, and come to a happy end, if thou showest\nthyself to be a religious and a righteous man, and an observer of the laws\nof thy country; but if not, expect adversity upon thy disobedience to them.\""}, "Now when the king had said this, he left off; but gave the description\nand pattern of the building of the temple in the sight of them all to Solomon:\nof the foundations and of the chambers, inferior and superior; how many\nthey were to be, and how large in height and in breadth; as also he determined\nthe weight of the golden and silver vessels: moreover, he earnestly excited\nthem with his words to use the utmost alacrity about the work; he exhorted\nthe rulers also, and particularly the tribe of Levi, to assist him, both\nbecause of his youth, and because God had chosen him to take care of the\nbuilding of the temple, and of the government of the kingdom.

Accordingly he went away in hopes of succeeding in this match.\nSo Solomon's mother went presently to her son, to speak to him about what\nshe had promised, upon Adonijah's supplication to her. And when her son\ncame forward to meet her, and embraced her, and when he had brought her\ninto the house where his royal throne was set, he sat thereon, and bid\nthem set another throne on the right hand for his mother.

But three years afterwards, when he heard\nthat two of his servants were run away from him, and were in Gath, he went\nfor his servants in haste; and when he was come back with them, the king\nperceived it, and was much displeased that he had contemned his commands,\nand, what was more, had no regard to the oaths he had sworn to God; so\nhe called him, and said to him, \"Didst not thou swear never to leave\nme, nor to go out of this city to another?

So Solomon asked of God what was most excellent,\nand of the greatest worth in itself, what God would bestow with the greatest.\njoy, and what it was most profitable for man to receive; for he\ndid not desire to have bestowed upon him either gold or silver, or any\nother riches, as a man and a youth might naturally have done, for these\nare the things that generally are esteemed by most men, as alone of the\ngreatest worth, and the best gifts of God; but, said he, \"Give me,\nO Lord, a sound mind, and a good understanding, whereby I may speak and\njudge the people according to truth and righteousness.\" With these\npetitions God was well pleased; and promised to give him all those things\nthat he had not mentioned in his option, riches, glory, victory over his\nenemies; and, in the first place, understanding and wisdom, and this in\nsuch a degree as no other mortal man, neither kings nor ordinary persons,\never had. He also promised to preserve the kingdom to his posterity for\na very long time, if he continued righteous and obedient to him, and imitated\nhis father in those things wherein he excelled. When Solomon heard this\nfrom God, he presently leaped out of his bed; and when he had worshipped\nhim, he returned to Jerusalem; and after he had offered great sacrifices\nbefore the tabernacle, he feasted all his own family."}, "In these days a hard cause came before him in judgment, which it\nwas very difficult to find any end of; and I think it necessary to explain\nthe fact about which the contest was, that such as light upon my writings\nmay know what a difficult cause Solomon was to determine, and those that\nare concerned in such matters may take this sagacity of the king for a\npattern, that they may the more easily give sentence about such questions.\nThere were two women, who were harlots in the course of their lives, that\ncame to him; of whom she that seemed to be injured began to speak first,\nand said, \"O king, I and this other woman dwell together in one room.\nNow it came to pass that we both bore a son at the same hour of the same\nday; and on the third day this woman overlaid her son, and killed it, and\nthen took my son out of my bosom, and removed him to herself, and as I\nwas asleep she laid her dead son in my arms. Now, when in the morning I\nwas desirous to give the breast to the child, I did not find my own, but\nsaw the woman's dead child lying by me; for I considered it exactly, and\nfound it so to be. Hence it was that I demanded my son, and when I could\nnot obtain him, I have recourse, my lord, to thy assistance; for since\nwe were alone, and there was nobody there that could convict her, she cares\nfor nothing, but perseveres in the stout denial of the fact.\" When\nthis woman had told this her story, the king asked the other woman what\nshe had to say in contradiction to that story. But when she denied that\nshe had done what was charged upon her, and said that it was her child\nthat was living, and that it was her antagonist's child that was dead,\nand when no one could devise what judgment could be given, and the whole\ncourt were blind in their understanding, and could not tell how to find\nout this riddle, the king alone invented the following way how to discover\nit. He bade them bring in both the dead child and the living child; and\nsent one of his guards, and commanded him to fetch a sword, and draw it,\nand to cut both the children into two pieces, that each of the women might\nhave half the living and half the dead child. Hereupon all the people privately\nlaughed at the king, as no more than a youth. But, in the mean time, she\nthat was the real mother of the living child cried out that he should not\ndo so, but deliver that child to the other woman as her own, for she would\nbe satisfied with the life of the child, and with the sight of it, although\nit were esteemed the other's child; but the other woman was ready to see\nthe child divided, and was desirous, moreover, that the first woman should\nbe tormented. When the king understood that both their words proceeded\nfrom the truth of their passions, he adjudged the child to her that cried\nout to save it, for that she was the real mother of it; and he condemned\nthe other as a wicked woman, who had not only killed her own child, but\nwas endeavoring to see her friend's child destroyed also. Now the multitude\nlooked on this determination as a great sign and demonstration of the king's\nsagacity and wisdom, and after that day attended to him as to one that\nhad a divine mind.", "Now the captains of his armies, and officers appointed over the whole\ncountry, were these: over the lot of Ephraim was Ures; over the toparchy\nof Bethlehem was Dioclerus; Abinadab, who married Solomon's daughter, had\nthe region of Dora and the sea-coast under him; the Great Plain was under\nBenaiah, the son of Achilus; he also governed all the country as far as\nJordan; Gabaris ruled over Gilead and Gaulanitis, and had under him the\nsixty great and fenced cities [of Og]; Achinadab managed the affairs of\nall Galilee as far as Sidon, and had himself also married a daughter of\nSolomon's, whose name was Basima; Banacates had the seacoast about Arce;\nas had Shaphat Mount Tabor, and Carmel, and [the Lower] Galilee, as far\nas the river Jordan; one man was appointed over all this country; Shimei\nwas intrusted with the lot of Benjamin; and Gabares had the country beyond\nJordan, over whom there was again one governor appointed.

So they\noffered up the daily sacrifices; but for the brazen altar, Solomon set\nit before the temple, over against the door, that when the door was opened,\nit might be exposed to sight, and the sacred solemnities, and the richness\nof the sacrifices, might be thence seen; and all the rest of the vessels\nthey gathered together, and put them within the temple."}, "Now as soon as the priests had put all things in order about the\nark, and were gone out, there cane down a thick cloud, and stood there,\nand spread itself, after a gentle manner, into the temple; such a cloud\nit was as was diffused and temperate, not such a rough one as we see full\nof rain in the winter season. This cloud so darkened the place, that one\npriest could not discern another, but it afforded to the minds of all a\nvisible image and glorious appearance of God's having descended into this\ntemple, and of his having gladly pitched his tabernacle therein. So these\nmen were intent upon this thought. But Solomon rose up, (for he was sitting\nbefore,) and used such words to God as he thought agreeable to the Divine\nnature to receive, and fit for him to give; for he said, \"Thou hast\nan eternal house, O Lord, and such a one as thou hast created for thyself\nout of thine own works; we know it to be the heaven, and the air, and the\nearth, and the sea, which thou pervadest, nor art thou contained within\ntheir limits.

I therefore ought myself to return thee thanks thereby,\nin the first place, concerning my father, whom thou hast raised from obscurity\nunto so great joy; and, in the next place, concerning myself, since thou\nhast performed all that thou hast promised unto this very day. And I beseech\nthee for the time to come to afford us whatsoever thou, O God, hast power\nto bestow on such as thou dost esteem; and to augment our house for all\nages, as thou hast promised to David my father to do, both in his lifetime\nand at his death, that our kingdom shall continue, and that his posterity\nshould successively receive it to ten thousand generations. Do not thou\ntherefore fail to give us these blessings, and to bestow on my children\nthat virtue in which thou delightest. And besides all this, I humbly beseech\nthee that thou wilt let some portion of thy Spirit come down and inhabit\nin this temple, that thou mayst appear to be with us upon earth. As to\nthyself, the entire heavens, and the immensity of the things that are therein,\nare but a small habitation for thee, much more is this poor temple so;\nbut I entreat thee to keep it as thine own house, from being destroyed\nby our enemies for ever, and to take care of it as thine own possession:\nbut if this people be found to have sinned, and be thereupon afflicted\nby thee with any plague, because of their sin, as with dearth or\npestilence, or any other affliction which thou usest to inflict on those\nthat transgress any of thy holy laws, and if they fly all of them to this\ntemple, beseeching thee, and begging of time to deliver them, then do thou\nhear their prayers, as being within thine house, and have mercy upon them,\nand deliver them from their afflictions.

For hereby all shall learn that thou thyself\nwast pleased with the building of this house for thee; and that we are\nnot ourselves of an unsociable nature, nor behave ourselves like enemies\nto such as are not of our own people; but are willing that thy assistance\nshould be communicated by thee to all men in common, and that they may\nhave the enjoyment of thy benefits bestowed upon them.\"", "When Solomon had said this, and had cast himself upon the ground,\nand worshipped a long time, he rose up, and brought sacrifices to the altar;\nand when he had filled it with unblemished victims, he most evidently discovered\nthat God had with pleasure accepted of all that he had sacrificed to him,\nfor there came a fire running out of the air, and rushed with violence\nupon the altar, in the sight of all, and caught hold of and consumed the\nsacrifices. Now when this Divine appearance was seen, the people supposed\nit to be a demonstration of God's abode in the temple, and were pleased\nwith it, and fell down upon the ground and worshipped. Upon which the king\nbegan to bless God, and exhorted the multitude to do the same, as now having\nsufficient indications of God's favorable disposition to them; and to pray\nthat they might always have the like indications from him, and that he\nwould preserve in them a mind pure from all wickedness, in righteousness\nand religious worship, and that they might continue in the observation\nof those precepts which God had given them by Moses, because by that means\nthe Hebrew nation would be happy, and indeed the most blessed of all nations\namong all mankind. He exhorted them also to be mindful, that by what methods\nthey had attained their present good things, by the same they must preserve\nthem sure to themselves, and make them greater and more than they were\nat present; for that it was not sufficient for them to suppose they had\nreceived them on account of their piety and righteousness, but that they\nhad no other way of preserving them for the time to come; for that it is\nnot so great a thing for men to acquire somewhat which they want, as to\npreserve what they have acquired, and to be guilty of no sin whereby it\nmay be hurt.", {"emph": "Feast of Tabernacles", "#text": "So when the king had spoken thus to the multitude, he dissolved the\ncongregation, but not till he had completed his oblations, both for himself\nand for the Hebrews, insomuch that he sacrificed twenty and two thousand\noxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep; for then it was that the\ntemple did first of all taste of the victims, and all the Hebrews, with\ntheir wives and children, feasted therein: nay, besides this, the king\nthen observed splendidly and magnificently the feast which is called the\n, before the temple, for twice seven days; and\nhe then feasted together with all the people."}, "When all these solemnities were abundantly satisfied, and nothing\nwas omitted that concerned the Divine worship, the king dismissed them;\nand they every one went to their own homes, giving thanks to the king for\nthe care he had taken of them, and the works he had done for them; and\npraying to God to preserve Solomon to be their king for a long time. They\nalso took their journey home with rejoicing, and making merry, and singing\nhymns to God. And indeed the pleasure they enjoyed took away the sense\nof the pains they all underwent in their journey home. So when they had\nbrought the ark into the temple, and had seen its greatness, and how fine\nit was, and had been partakers of the many sacrifices that had been offered,\nand of the festivals that had been solemnized, they every one returned\nto their own cities. But a dream that appeared to the king in his sleep\ninformed him that God had heard his prayers; and that he would not only\npreserve the temple, but would always abide in it; that is, in case his\nposterity and the whole multitude would be righteous. And for himself,\nit said, that if he continued according to the admonitions of his father,\nhe would advance him to an immense degree of dignity and happiness, and\nthat then his posterity should be kings of that country, of the tribe of\nJudah, for ever; but that still, if he should be found a betrayer of the\nordinances of the law, and forget them, and turn away to the worship of\nstrange gods, he would cut him off by the roots, and would neither suffer\nany remainder of his family to continue, nor would overlook the people\nof Israel, or preserve them any longer from afflictions, but would utterly\ndestroy them with ten thousand wars and misfortunes; would cast them out\nof the land which he had given their fathers, and make them sojourners\nin strange lands; and deliver that temple which was now built to be burnt\nand spoiled by their enemies, and that city to be utterly overthrown by\nthe hands of their enemies; and make their miseries deserve to be a proverb,\nand such as should very hardly be credited for their stupendous magnitude,\ntill their neighbors, when they should hear of them, should wonder at their\ncalamities, and very earnestly inquire for the occasion, why the Hebrews,\nwho had been so far advanced by God to such glory and wealth, should be\nthen so hated by him? and that the answer that should be made by the remainder\nof the people should be, by confessing their sins, and their transgression\nof the laws of their country. Accordingly we have it transmitted to us\nin writing, that thus did God speak to Solomon in his sleep.", "AFTER the building of the temple, which, as we have before said,\nwas finished in seven years, the king laid the foundation of his palace,\nwhich be did not finish under thirteen years, for he was not equally zealous\nin the building of this palace as he had been about the temple; for as\nto that, though it was a great work, and required wonderful and surprising\napplication, yet God, for whom it was made, so far co-operated therewith,\nthat it was finished in the forementioned number of years: but the palace,\nwhich was a building much inferior in dignity to the temple, both on account\nthat its materials had not been so long beforehand gotten ready, nor had\nbeen so zealously prepared, and on account that this was only a habitation\nfor kings, and not for God, it was longer in finishing. However, this building\nwas raised so magnificently, as suited the happy state of the Hebrews,\nand of the king thereof.

V.\nch. 5. sect. 3,) that one of the gates of Herod's temple was built according\nto the rules of this Corinthian order, is no way improbable, that order\nbeing, without dispute, much older than the reign of Herod. However, upon\nsome trial, I confess I have not hitherto been able fully to understand\nthe structure of this palace of Solomon, either as described in our Bibles,\nor even with the additional help of this description here by Josephus;\nonly the reader may easily observe with me, that the measures of this first\nbuilding in Josephus, a hundred cubits long, and fifty cubits broad, are\nthe very same with the area of the cart of the tabernacle of Moses. and\njust hall' an Egyptian orout, or acre."}, "#text": "This house was a large and curious building, and was supported by\nmany pillars, which Solomon built to contain a multitnde for hearing causes,\nand taking cognizance of suits. It was sufficiently capacious to contain\na great body of men, who would come together to have their causes determined.\nIt was a hundred cubits long, and fifty broad, and thirty high, supported\nby quadrangular pillars, which were all of cedar; but its roof was according\nto the Corinthian order, \nwith folding doors, and their adjoining pillars of equal magnitude, each\nfluted with three cavities; which building as at once firm, and very ornamental.\nThere was also another house so ordered, that its entire breadth was placed\nin the middle; it was quadrangular, and its breadth was thirty cubits,\nhaving a temple over against it, raised upon massy pillars; in which temple\nthere was a large and very glorious room, wherein the king sat in judgment.\nTo this was joined another house that was built for his queen. There were\nother smaller edifices for diet, and for sleep, after public matters were\nover; and these were all floored with boards of cedar. Some of these Solomon\nbuilt with stones of ten cubits, and wainscoted the walls with other stones\nthat were sawed, and were of great value, such as are dug out of the earth\nfor the ornaments of temples, and to make fine prospects in royal palaces,\nand which make the mines whence they are dug famous. Now the contexture\nof the curious workmanship of these stones was in three rows, but the fourth\nrow would make one admire its sculptures, whereby were represented trees,\nand all sorts of plants; with the shades that arose from their branches,\nand leaves that hung down from them. Those trees anti plants covered the\nstone that was beneath them, and their leaves were wrought so prodigious\nthin and subtile, that you would think they were in motion; but the other\npart up to the roof, was plastered over, and, as it were, embroidered with\ncolors and pictures. He, moreover, built other edifices for pleasure; as\nalso very long cloisters, and those situate in an agreeable place of the\npalace; and among them a most glorious dining room, for feastings and compotations,\nand full of gold, and such other furniture as so fine a room ought to have\nfor the conveniency of the guests, and where all the vessels were made\nof gold. Now it is very hard to reckon up the magnitude and the variety\nof the royal apartments; how many rooms there were of the largest sort,\nhow many of a bigness inferior to those, and how many that were subterraneous\nand invisible; the curiosity of those that enjoyed the fresh air; and the\ngroves for the most delightful prospect, for the avoiding the heat, and\ncovering of their bodies. And, to say all in brief, Solomon made the whole\nbuilding entirely of white stone, and cedar wood, and gold, and silver.\nHe also adorned the roofs and walls with stones set in gold, and beautified\nthem thereby in the same manner as he had beautified the temple of God\nwith the like stones. He also made himself a throne of prodigious bigness,\nof ivory, constructed as a seat of justice, and having six steps to it;\non every one of which stood, on each end of the step two lions, two other\nlions standing above also; but at the sitting place of the throne hands\ncame out and received the king; and when he sat backward, he rested on\nhalf a bullock, that looked towards his back; but still all was fastened\ntogether with gold."}, {"emph": "what does not please", "#text": "When Solomon had completed all this in twenty years' time, because\nHiram king of Tyre had contributed a great deal of gold, and more silver\nto these buildings, as also cedar wood and pine wood, he also rewarded\nHiram with rich presents; corn he sent him also year by year, and wine\nand oil, which were the principal things that he stood in need of, because\nhe inhabited an island, as we have already said. And besides these, he\ngranted him certain cities of Galilee, twenty in number, that lay not far\nfrom Tyre; which, when Hiram went to, and viewed, and did not like the\ngift, he sent word to Solomon that he did not want such cities as they\nwere; and after that time these cities were called the land of Cabul; which\nname, if it be interpreted according to the language of the Phoenicians,\ndenotes . Moreover, the king of Tyre sent sophisms\nand enigmatical sayings to Solomon, and desired he would solve them, and\nfree them from the ambiguity that was in them. Now so sagacious and understanding\nwas Solomon, that none of these problems were too hard for him; but he\nconquered them all by his reasonings, and discovered their hidden meaning,\nand brought it to light. Menander also, one who translated the Tyrian archives\nout of the dialect of the Phoenicians into the Greek language, makes mention\nof these two kings, where he says thus: \"When Abibalus was dead,.\nhis son Hiram received the kingdom from him, who, when he had lived fifty-three\nyears, reigned thirty-four. He raised a bank in the large place, and dedicated\nthe golden pillar which is in Jupiter's temple. He also went and cut down\nmaterials of timber out of the mountain called Libanus, for the roof of\ntemples; and when he had pulled down the ancient temples, he both built\nthe temple of Hercules and that of Astarte; and he first set up the temple\nof Hercules in the month Peritius; he also made an expedition against the\nEuchii, or Titii, who did not pay their tribute, and when he had subdued\nthem to himself he returned. Under this king there was Abdemon, a very\nyouth in age, who always conquered the difficult problems which Solomon,\nking of Jerusalem, commanded him to explain. Dius also makes mention of\nhim, where he says thus: \"When Abibalus was dead, his son Hiram reigned.\nHe raised the eastern parts of the city higher, and made the city itself\nlarger. He also joined the temple of Jupiter, which before stood by itself,\nto the city, by raising a bank in the middle between them; and he adorned\nit with donations of gold. Moreover, he went up to Mount Libanus, and cut\ndown materials of wood for the building of the temples.\" He says also,\nthat Solomon, who was then king of Jerusalem, sent riddles to Hiram, and\ndesired to receive the like from him, but that he who could not solve them\nshould pay money to them that did solve them, and that Hiram accepted the\nconditions; and when he was not able to solve the riddles proposed by Solomon,\nhe paid a great deal of money for his fine; but that he afterward did solve\nthe proposed riddles by means of Abdemon, a man of Tyre; and that Hiram\nproposed other riddles, which, when Solomon could not solve, he paid back\na great deal of money to Hiram.\" This it is which Dius wrote."}, "Now when the king saw that the walls of Jerusalem stood in need of\nbeing better secured, and made stronger, (for he thought the wails that\nencompassed Jerusalem ought to correspond to the dignity of the city,)\nhe both repaired them, and made them higher, with great towers upon them;\nhe also built cities which might be counted among the strongest, Hazor\nand Megiddo, and the third Gezer, which had indeed belonged to the Philistines;\nbut Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, had made an expedition against it, and\nbesieged it, and taken it by force; and when he had slain all its inhabitants,\nhe utterly overthrew it, and gave it as a present to his daughter, who\nhad been married to Solomon; for which reason the king rebuilt it, as a\ncity that was naturally strong, and might be useful in wars, and the mutations\nof affairs that sometimes happen. Moreover, he built two other cities not\nfar from it, Beth-horon was the name of one of them, and Baalath of the\nother. He also built other cities that lay conveniently for these, in order\nto the enjoyment of pleasures and delicacies in them, such as were naturally\nof a good temperature of the air, and agreeable for fruits ripe in their\nproper seasons, and well watered with springs. Nay, Solomon went as far\nas the desert above Syria, and possessed himself of it, and built there\na very great city, which was distant two days' journey from Upper Syria,\nand one day's journey from Euphrates, and six long days' journey from Babylon\nthe Great. Now the reason why this city lay so remote from the parts of\nSyria that are inhabited is this, that below there is no water to be had,\nand that it is in that place only that there are springs and pits of water.\nWhen he had therefore built this city, and encompassed it with very strong\nwalls, he gave it the name of Tadmor, and that is the name it is still\ncalled by at this day among the Syrians, but the Greeks name it Palmyra.", {"gloss": "king", "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This signification of the name Pharaoh appears to be true.

The Roman emperors\nalso were from their nativity called by other names, but are styled Caesars,\ntheir empire and their dignity imposing that name upon them, and not suffering\nthem to continue in those names which their fathers gave them. I suppose\nalso that Herodotus of Halicarnassus, when he said there were three hundred\nand thirty kings of Egypt after Menes, who built Memphis, did therefore\nnot tell us their names, because they were in common called Pharaohs; for\nwhen after their death there was a queen reigned, he calls her by her name\nNicaule, as thereby declaring, that while the kings were of the male line,\nand so admitted of the same nature, while a woman did not admit the same,\nhe did therefore set down that her name, which she could not naturally\nhave. As for myself, I have discovered from our own books, that after Pharaoh,\nthe father-in-law of Solomon, no other king of Egypt did any longer use\nthat name; and that it was after that time when the forenamed queen of\nEgypt and Ethiopia came to Solomon, concerning whom we shall inform the\nreader presently; but I have now made mention of these things, that I may\nprove that our books and those of the Egyptians agree together in many\nthings."}, "But king Solomon subdued to himself the remnant of the Canaanites\nthat had not before submitted to him; those I mean that dwelt in Mount\nLebanon, and as far as the city Hamath; and ordered them to pay tribute.\nHe also chose out of them every year such as were to serve him in the meanest\noffices, and to do his domestic works, and to follow husbandry; for none\nof the Hebrews were servants [in such low employments]: nor was it reasonable,\nthat when God had brought so many nations under their power, they should\ndepress their own people to such mean offices of life, rather than those\nnations; while all the Israelites were concerned in warlike affairs, and\nwere in armor; and were set over the chariots and the horses, rather than\nleading the life of slaves.

So he went up to the altar, with his own priests\nabout him; but when he was going to offer the sacrifices and the burnt-offerings,\nin the sight of all the people, a prophet, whose name was Jadon, was sent\nby God, and came to him from Jerusalem, who stood in the midst of the multitude,\nand in the 'hearing of' the king, and directing his discourse to the altar,\nsaid thus: \"God foretells that there shall be a certain man of the family\nof David, Josiah by name, who shall slay upon thee those false priests\nthat shall live at that time, and upon thee shall burn the bones of those\ndeceivers of the people, those impostors' and wicked wretches. However,\nthat this people may believe that these things shall so come to pass, I\nforetell a sign to them that shall also come to pass. This altar shall\nbe broken to pieces immediately, and all the fat of the sacrifices that\nis upon it shall be poured upon the ground.\" When the prophet had\nsaid this, Jeroboam fell into a passion, and stretched out his hand, and\nbid them lay hold of him; but that hand which he stretched out was enfeebled,\nand he was not able to pull it in again to him, for it was become withered,\nand hung down, as if it were a dead hand. The altar also was broken to\npieces, and all that was upon it was poured out, as the prophet had foretold\nshould come to pass. So the king understood that he was a man of veracity,\nand had a Divine foreknowledge; and entreated him to pray to God that he\nwould restore his right hand. Accordingly the prophet did pray to God to\ngrant him that request. So the king, having his hand recovered to its natural\nstate, rejoiced at it, and invited the prophet to sup with him; but Jadon\nsaid that he could not endure to come into his house, nor to taste of bread\nor water in this city, for that was a thing God had forbidden him to do;\nas also to go back by the same way which he came, but he said he was to\nreturn by another way. So the king wondered at the abstinence of the man,\nbut was himself in fear, as suspecting a change of his affairs for the\nworse, from what had been said to him.", {"emph": ["of divine man", "an excellent\nprophet"], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "How much a larger and better copy Josephus had in this remarkable history\nof the true prophet of Judea, and his concern with Jeroboam, and with the\nfalse prophet of Bethel, than our other copies have, is evident at first\nsight.

Whereupon he was afraid that this stranger and\nprophet should be in better esteem with the king than himself, and obtain\ngreater honor from him: and he gave orders to his sons to saddle his ass\npresently, and make all ready that he might go out. Accordingly they made\nhaste to do what they were commanded, and he got upon the ass and followed\nafter the prophet.; and when he had overtaken him, as he was resting himself\nunder a very large oak tree that was thick and shady, he at first saluted\nhim, but presently he complained of him, because he had not come into his\nhouse, and partaken of his hospitality. And when the other said that God\nhad forbidden him to taste of any one's provision in that city, he replied,\nthat \"for certain God had not forbidden that I should set food before\nthee, for I am a prophet as thou art, and worship God in the same manner\nthat thou dost; and I am now come as sent by him, in order to bring thee\ninto my house, and make thee my guest.\" Now Jadon gave credit to this\nlying prophet, and returned back with him. But when they were at dinner,\nand merry together, God appeared to Jadon, and said that he should suffer\npunishment for transgressing his commands, - and he told him what that\npunishment should be for he said that he should meet with a lion as he\nwas going on his way, by which lion he should be torn in pieces, and be\ndeprived of burial in the sepulchers of his fathers; which things came\nto pass, as I suppose, according to the will of God, that so Jeroboam might\nnot give heed to the words of Jadon as of one that had been convicted of\nlying. However, as Jadon was again going to Jerusalem, a lion assaulted\nhim, and pulled him off the beast he rode on, and slew him; yet did he\nnot at all hurt the ass, but sat by him, and kept him, as also the prophet's\nbody. This continued till some travelers that saw it came and told it in\nthe city to the false prophet, who sent his sons, and brought the body\nunto the city, and made a funeral for him at great expense. He also charged\nhis sons to bury himself with him and said that all which he had foretold\nagainst that city, and the altar, and priests, and false prophets, would\nprove true; and that if he were buried with him, he should receive no injurious\ntreatment after his death, the bones not being then to be distinguished\nasunder. But now, when he had performed those funeral rites to the prophet,\nand had given that charge to his sons, as he was a wicked and an impious\nman, he goes to Jeroboam, and says to him, \"And wherefore is it now\nthat thou art disturbed at the words of this silly fellow?\" And when\nthe king had related to him what had happened about the altar, and about\nhis own hand, and gave him the names , and , he endeavored by a wicked trick to weaken that his opinion;\nand by using plausible words concerning what had happened, he aimed to\ninjure the truth that was in them; for he attempted to persuade him that\nhis hand was enfeebled by the labor it had undergone in supporting the\nsacrifices, and that upon its resting awhile it returned to its former\nnature again; and that as to the altar, it was but new, and had borne abundance\nof sacrifices, and those large ones too, and was accordingly broken to\npieces, and fallen down by the weight of what had been laid upon it. He\nalso informed him of the death of him that had foretold those things, and\nhow he perished; [whence he concluded that] he had not any thing in him\nof a prophet, nor spake any thing like one. When he had thus spoken, he\npersuaded the king, and entirely alienated his mind from God, and from\ndoing works that were righteous and holy, and encouraged him to go on in\nhis impious practices \nand accordingly he was to that degree injurious to God, and so great a\ntransgressor, that he sought for nothing else every day but how he might\nbe guilty of some new instances of wickedness, and such as should be more\ndetestable than what he had been so insolent as to do before.

Agreeable whereto it\nnow happened to the subjects of Rehoboam; for when he was grown impious,\nand a transgressor himself, they endeavored not to offend him by resolving\nstill to be righteous.

These he brought with him, and they were the\ngreatest part of them Libyans and Ethiopians.

When they heard this,\nthey were immediately in a consternation of mind; and seeing no way of\ndeliverance, they all earnestly set themselves to confess that God might\njustly overlook them, since they had been guilty of impiety towards him,\nand had let his laws lie in confusion. So when God saw them in that disposition,\nand that they acknowledge their sins, he told the prophet that he would\nnot destroy them, but that he would, however, make them servants to the\nEgyptians, that they may learn whether they will suffer less by serving\nmen or God. So when Shishak had taken the city without fighting, because\nRehoboam was afraid, and received him into it, yet did not Shishak stand\nto the covenants he had made, but he spoiled the temple, and emptied the\ntreasures of God, and those of the king, and carried off innumerable ten\nthousands of gold and silver, and left nothing at all behind him.

And whereas a soil of his lay sick at that\ntime, who was called Abijah, he enjoined his wife to lay aside her robes,\nand to take the garments belonging to a private person, and to go to Ahijah\nthe prophet, for that he was a wonderful man in foretelling futurities,\nit having been he who told me that I should be king.

So she was in lamentation\nas she went along the road, and mourned for the death of her son, that\nwas just at hand. She was indeed in a miserable condition at the unavoidable\nmisery of his death, and went apace, but in circumstances very unfortunate,\nbecause of her son: for the greater haste she made, she would the sooner\nsee her son dead, yet was she forced to make such haste on account of her\nhusband.

But he\nbid her be of good cheer, and deliver her son to him, for that he would\ndeliver him again to her alive. So when she had delivered her son up to\nhim, he carried him into an upper room, where he himself lodged, and laid\nhim down upon the bed, and cried unto God, and said, that God had not done\nwell, in rewarding the woman who had entertained him and sustained him,\nby taking away her son; and he prayed that he would send again the soul\nof the child into him, and bring him to life again. Accordingly God took\npity on the mother, and was willing to gratify the prophet, that he might\nnot seem to have come to her to do her a mischief, and the child, beyond\nall expectation, came to life again.

What is said of David also gives light to this, who was reproached\nby Michal for \"dancing before the ark, and uncovering himself in the\neyes of his handmaids, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth\nhimself,\" 2 Samuel 6:14, 20; yet it is there expressly said (ver.\n14) that \"David was girded with a linen ephod,\" i.e. he had laid\naside his robes of state, and put on the sacerdotal, Levitical, or sacred\ngarments, proper for such a solemnity."}, "#text": "Now when Benhadad heard this, he had indignation, and sent ambassadors\nto Ahab the third time, and threatened that his army would raise a bank\nhigher than those walls, in confidence of whose strength he despised him,\nand that by only each man of his army taking a handful of earth; hereby\nmaking a show of the great number of his army, and aiming to affright him.\nAhab answered, that he ought not to vaunt himself when he had only put\non his armor, but when he should have conquered his enemies in the battle.\nSo the ambassadors came back, and found the king at supper with his thirty-two\nkings, and informed him of Ahab's answer; who then immediately gave order\nfor proceeding thus: To make lines round the city, and raise a bulwark,\nand to prosecute the siege all manner of ways. Now, as this was doing,\nAhab was in a great agony, and all his people with him; but he took courage,\nand was freed from his fears, upon a certain prophet coming to him, and\nsaying to him, that God had promised to subdue so many ten thousands of\nhis enemies under him.

So when he was informed that the king\nof Syria had betaken himself to feasting and repose, he opened the gates,\nand sent out the princes' sons. Now when the sentinels told Benhadad of\nit, he sent some to meet them, and commanded them, that if these men were\ncome out for fighting, they should bind them, and bring them to him; and\nthat if they came out peaceably, they should do the same. Now Ahab had\nanother army ready within the walls, but the sons of the princes fell upon\nthe out-guard, and slew many of them, and pursued the rest of them to the\ncamp; and when the king of Israel saw that these had the upper hand, he\nsent out all the rest of his army, which, falling suddenly upon the Syrians,\nbeat them, for they did not think they would have come out; on which account\nit was that they assaulted them when they were naked \nand drunk, insomuch that they left all their armor behind them when they\nfled out of the camp, and the king himself escaped with difficulty, by\nfleeing away on horseback. But Ahab went a great way in pursuit of the\nSyrians; and when he had spoiled their camp, which contained a great deal\nof wealth, and moreover a large quantity of gold and silver, he took Benhadad's\nchariots and horses, and returned to the city; but as the prophet told\nhim he ought to have his army ready, because the Syrian king would make\nanother expedition against him the next year, Ahab was busy in making provision\nfor it accordingly."}, "Now Benhadad, when he had saved himself, and as much of his army\nas he could, out of the battle, he consulted with his friends how he might\nmake another expedition against the Israelites.

They also gave him this further advice, to send\nhome those kings whom he had brought as his auxiliaries, but to retain\ntheir army, and to set captains over it instead of the kings, and to raise\nan army out of their country, and let them be in the place of the former\nwho perished in the battle, together with horses and chariots.

So they received\nassurances upon oath from him, that when he came to him he should receive\nno harm from him, and then went and brought him out of the cellar wherein\nhe was hid, and brought him to Ahab as he sat in his chariot.

With\nthis the whole multitude was so pleased, that they were not so eagerly\nset upon or affected with any thing so much as the observation of the laws.\nThe neighboring nations also continued to love Jehoshaphat, and to be at\npeace with him. The Philistines paid their appointed tribute, and the Arabians\nsupplied him every year with three hundred and sixty lambs, and as many\nkids of the goats. He also fortified the great cities, which were many\nin number, and of great consequence. He prepared also a mighty army of\nsoldiers and weapons against their enemies. Now the army of men that wore\ntheir armor, was three hundred thousand of the tribe of Judah, of whom\nAdnah was the chief; but John was chief of two hundred thousand. The same\nman was chief of the tribe of Benjamin, and had two hundred thousand archers\nunder him.

Now these prophets\ngave their counsel for making this expedition, and said that he would beat\nthe king of Syria, and, as formerly, would reduce him under his power.\nBut Jehoshaphat, understanding by their words that they were false prophets,\nasked Ahab whether there were not some other prophet, and he belonging\nto the true God, that we may have surer information concerning futurities.\nHereupon Ahab said there was indeed such a one, but that he hated him,\nas having prophesied evil to him, and having foretold that he should be\novercome and slain by the king of Syria, and that for this cause he had\nhim now in prison, and that his name was Micaiah, the son of Imlah.

Now the eunuch had informed him by the way,\nthat all the other prophets had foretold that the king should gain the\nvictory; but he said, that it was not lawful for him to lie against God,\nbut that he must speak what he should say to him about the king, whatsoever\nit were.

Whereupon the\nking was in suspense with himself: but Zedekiah, one of those false prophets,\ncame near, and exhorted him not to hearken to Micaiah, for he did not at\nall speak truth; as a demonstration of which he instanced in what Elijah\nhad said, who was a better prophet in foretelling futurities than Micaiah\n for\nhe foretold that the dogs should lick his blood in the city of Jezreel,\nin the field of Naboth, as they licked the blood of Naboth, who by his\nmeans was there stoned to death by the multitude; that therefore it was\nplain that this Micalab was a liar, as contradicting a greater prophet\nthan himself, and saying that he should be slain at three days' journey\ndistance: \"and [said he] you shall soon know whether he be a true\nprophet, and hath the power of the Divine Spirit; for I will smite him,\nand let him then hurt my hand, as Jadon caused the hand of Jeroboam the\nking to wither when he would have caught him; for I suppose thou hast certainly\nheard of that accident.\" So when, upon his smiting Micaiah, no harm\nhappened to him, Ahab took courage, and readily led his army against the\nking of Syria; for, as I suppose, fate was too hard for him, and made him\nbelieve that the false prophets spake truer than the true one, that it\nmight take an occasion of bringing him to his end. However, Zedekiah made\nhorns of iron, and said to Ahab, that God made those horns signals, that\nby them he should overthrow all Syria. But Micaiah replied, that Zedekiah,\nin a few days, should go from one secret chamber to another to hide himself,\nthat he might escape the punishment of his lying.

So\nGod caused a terror and a commotion to arise among the Ammonites, who thought\none another to be enemies, and slew one another, insomuch that not one\nman out of so great an army escaped; and when Jehoshaphat looked upon that\nvalley wherein their enemies had been encamped, and saw it full of dead\nmen, he rejoiced at so surprising an event, as was this assistance of God,\nwhile he himself by his own power, and without their labor, had given them\nthe victory. He also gave his army leave to take the prey of the enemy's\ncamp, and to spoil their dead bodies; and indeed so they did for three\ndays together, till they were weary, so great was the number of the slain;\nand on the fourth day, all the people were gathered together unto a certain\nhollow place or valley, and blessed God for his power and assistance, from\nwhich the place had this name given it, the Valley of [Berachah, or] Blessing.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "What\nare here Pontus and Thrace, as the places whither Jehoshaphat's fleet sailed,\nare in our other copies Ophir and Tarshish, and the place whence it sailed\nis in them Eziongeber, which lay on the Red Sea, whence it was impossible\nfor any ships to sail to Pontus or Thrace; so that Josephus's copy differed\nfrom our other copies, as is further plain from his own words, which render\nwhat we read, that \"the ships were broken at Eziongeber, from their\nunwieldy greatness.\" But so far we may conclude, that Josephus thought\none Ophir to be some where in the Mediterranean, and not in the South Sea,\nthough perhaps there might be another Ophir in that South Sea also, and\nthat fleets might then sail both from Phoenicia and from the Red Sea to\nfetch the gold of Ophir."}, "#text": "And when the king had brought his army back to Jerusalem, he betook\nhimself to celebrate festivals, and offer sacrifices, and this for many\ndays.

In the second year of his reign, the king of Moab fell\noff from his obedience, and left off paying those tributes which he before\npaid to his father Ahab. Now it happened that Ahaziah, as he was coming\ndown from the top of his house, fell down from it, and in his sickness\nsent to the Fly, which was the god of Ekron, for that was this god's name,\nto inquire about his recovery \nbut the God of the Hebrews appeared to Elijah the prophet, and commanded\nhim to go and meet the messengers that were sent, and to ask them, whether\nthe people of Israel had pot a God of their own, that the king sent to\na foreign god to inquire about his recovery? and to bid them return and\ntell the king that he would not escape this disease. And when Elijah had\nperformed what God had commanded him, and the messengers had heard what\nhe said, they returned to the king immediately; and when the king wondered\nhow they could return so soon, and asked them the reason of it, they said\nthat a certain man met them, and forbade them to go on any farther; but\nto return and tell thee, from the command of the God of Israel, that this\ndisease will have a bad end. And when the king bid them describe the man\nthat said this to them, they replied that he was a hairy man, and was girt\nabout with a girdle of leather. So the king understood by this that the\nman who was described by the messengers was Elijah; whereupon he sent a\ncaptain to him, with fifty soldiers, and commanded them to bring Elijah\nto him; and when the captain that was sent found Elijah sitting upon the\ntop of a hill, he commanded him to come down, and to come to the king,\nfor so had he enjoined; but that in case he refused, they would carry him\nby force. Elijah said to him, \"That you may have a trial whether I\nbe a true prophet, I will pray that fire may fall from heaven, and destroy\nboth the soldiers and yourself.\" \nSo he prayed, and a whirlwind of fire fell [from heaven], and destroyed\nthe captain, and those that were with him.

And when this\ncaptain also threatened the prophet, that unless he came down of his own\naccord, he would take him and carry him away, upon his prayer against him,\nthe fire [from heaven] slew this captain as well the other. And when, upon\ninquiry, the king was informed of what happened to him, he sent out a third\ncaptain. But when this captain, who was a wise man, and of a mild disposition,\ncame to the place where Elijah happened to be, and spake civilly to him;\nand said that he knew that it was without his own consent, and only in\nsubmission to the king's command that he came to him; and that those that\ncame before did not come willingly, but on the same account;  he therefore\ndesired him to have pity on those armed men that were with him, and that\nhe would come down and follow him to the king.

Now at this time it was\nthat Elijah disappeared from among men, and no one knows of his death to\nthis very day; but he left behind him his disciple Elisha, as we have formerly\ndeclared.

And when they had taken a compass of seven days'\njourney, they were in distress for want of water for the cattle, and for\nthe army, from the mistake of their roads by the guides that conducted\nthem, insomuch that they were all in an agony, especially Joram; and cried\nto God, by reason of their sorrow, and [desired to know] what wickedness\nhad been committed by them that induced him to deliver three kings together,\nwithout fighting, unto the king of Moab.

And when one of the servants of Joram said that\nhe had seen there Elisha, the son of Shaphat, the disciple of Elijah, the\nthree kings went to him, at the entreaty of Jehoshaphat; and when they\nwere come at the prophet's tent, which tent was pitched out of the camp,\nthey asked him what would become of the army? and Joram was particularly\nvery pressing with him about it.

But when at the rising of the sun they saw the water in the\ntorrent, for it was not far from the land of Moab, and that it was of the\ncolor of blood, for at such a time the water especially looks red, by the\nshining of the sun upon it, they formed a false notion of the state of\ntheir enemies, as if they had slain one another for thirst; and that the\nriver ran with their blood. However, supposing that this was the case,\nthey desired their king would send them out to spoil their enemies; whereupon\nthey all went in haste, as to an advantage already gained, and came to\nthe enemy's camp, as supposing them destroyed already. But their hope deceived\nthem; for as their enemies stood round about them, some of them were cut\nto pieces, and others of them were dispersed, and fled to their own country.\nAnd when the kings fell into the land of Moab, they overthrew the cities\nthat were in it, and spoiled their fields, and marred them, filling them\nwith stones out of the brooks, and cut down the best of their trees, and\nstopped up their fountains of water, and overthrew their walls to their\nfoundations. But the king of Moab, when he was pursued, endured a siege;\nand seeing his city in danger of being overthrown by force, made a sally,\nand went out with seven hundred men, in order to break through the enemy's\ncamp with his horsemen, on that side where the watch seemed to be kept\nmost negligently; and when, upon trial, he could not get away, for he lighted\nupon a place that was carefully watched, he returned into the city, and\ndid a thing that showed despair and the utmost distress; for he took his\neldest son, who was to reign after him, and lifting him up upon the wall,\nthat he might be visible to all the enemies, he offered him as a whole\nburnt-offering to God, whom, when the kings saw, they commiserated the\ndistress that was the occasion of it, and were so affected, in way of humanity\nand pity, that they raised the siege, and every one returned to his own\nhouse.

So he gave order that they\nshould send some to learn in what city Elisha dwelt. Accordingly those\nthat were sent brought word that he was in Dothan; wherefore Benhadad sent\nto that city a great army, with horses and chariots, to take Elisha: so\nthey encompassed the city round about by night, and kept him therein confined;\nbut when the prophet's servant in the morning perceived this, and that\nhis enemies sought to take Elisha, he came running, and crying out after\na disordered manner to him, and told him of it; but he encouraged him,\nand bid him not be afraid, and to despise the enemy, and trust in the assistance\nof God, and was himself without fear; and he besought God to make manifest\nto his servant his power and presence, so far as was possible, in order\nto the inspiring him with hope and courage. Accordingly God heard the prayer\nof the prophet, and made the servant see a multitude of chariots and horses\nencompassing Elisha, till he laid aside his fear, and his courage revived\nat the sight of what he supposed was come to their assistance.

Accordingly,\nwhen they were freed from the obscurity they had been in, they saw themselves\nin the midst of their enemies; and as the Syrians were strangely amazed\nand distressed, as was but reasonable, at an action so Divine and surprising,\nand as king Joram asked the prophet if he would give him leave to shoot\nat them, Elisha forbade him so to do; and said, that \"it is just to\nkill those that are taken in battle, but that these men had done the country\nno harm, but, without knowing it, were come thither by the Divine Power:\"\n so that his counsel was to treat them in a hospitable manner at his table,\nand then send them away without hurting them. \nWherefore Joram obeyed the prophet; and when he had feasted the Syrians\nin a splendid and magnificent manner, he let them go to Benhadad their\nking."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This son of a murderer was Joram, the son of Ahab, which Ahab slew, or\npermitted his wife Jezebel to slay, the Lord's prophets, and Naboth, 1\nKings 18:4; 21:19; and he is here called by this name, I suppose, because\nhe had now also himself sent an officer to murder him; yet is Josephus's\naccount of Joram's coming himself at last. as repenting of his intended\ncruelty, much more probable than that in our copies, 2 Kings 6:33, which\nrather implies the contrary."}, "#text": "Now when these men were come back, and had showed Benhadad how strange\nan accident had befallen them, and what an appearance and power they had\nexperienced of the God of Israel, he wondered at it, as also at that prophet\nwith whom God was so evidently present; so he determined to make no more\nsecret attempts upon the king of Israel, out of fear of Elisha, but resolved\nto make open war with them, as supposing he could be too hard for his enemies\nby the multitude of his army and power. So he made an expedition with a\ngreat army against Joram, who, not thinking himself a match for him, shut\nhimself up in Samaria, and depended on the strength of its walls; but Benhadad\nsupposed he should take the city, if not by his engines of war, yet that\nhe should overcome the Samaritans by famine, and the want of necessaries,\nand brought his army upon them, and besieged the city; and the plenty of\nnecessaries was brought so low with Joram, that from the extremity of want\nan ass's head was sold in Samaria for fourscore pieces of silver, and the\nHebrews bought a sextary of dore's dung, instead of salt, for five pieces\nof silver. Now Joram was in fear lest somebody should betray the city to\nthe enemy, by reason of the famine, and went every day round the walls\nand the guards to see whether any such were concealed among them; and by\nbeing thus seen, and taking such care, he deprived them of the opportunity\nof contriving any such thing; and if they had a mind to do it, he, by this\nmeans, prevented them: but upon a certain woman's crying out, \"Have\npity on me, my lord,\" while he thought that she was about to ask for\nsomewhat to eat, he imprecated God's curse upon her, and said he had neither\nthrashing-floor nor wine-press, whence he might give her any thing at her\npetition. Upon which she said she did not desire his aid in any such thing,\nnor trouble him about food, but desired that he would do her justice as\nto another woman. And when be bade her say on, and let him know what she\ndesired, she said she had made an agreement with the other woman who was\nher neighbor and her friend, that because the famine and want was intolerable,\nthey should kill their children, each of them having a son of their own,\nand we will live upon them ourselves for two days, the one day upon one\nson, and the other day upon the other; and,\" said she, I have killed\nmy son the first day, and we lived upon my son yesterday; but this other\nwoman will not do the same thing, but hath broken her agreement, and hath\nhid her son.\" This story mightily grieved Joram when he heard it;\nso he rent his garment, and cried out with a loud voice, and conceived\ngreat wrath against Elisha the prophet, and set himself eagerly to have\nhim slain, because he did not pray to God to provide them some exit and\nway of escape out of the miseries with which they were surrounded; and\nsent one away immediately to cut off his head, who made haste to kill the\nprophet. But Elisha was not unacquainted with the wrath of the king against\nhim; for as he sat in his house by himself, with none but his disciples\nabout him, he told them that Joram, \nwho was the son of a murderer, had sent one to take away his head; \"but,\"\nsaid he, \"when he that is commanded to do this comes, take care that\nyou do not let him come in, but press the door against him, and hold him\nfast there, for the king himself will follow him, and come to me, having\naltered his mind.\" Accordingly, they did as they were bidden, when\nhe that was sent by the king to kill Elisha came. But Joram repented of\nhis wrath against the prophet; and for fear he that was commanded to kill\nhim should have done it before he came, he made haste to hinder his slaughter,\nand to save the prophet: and when he came to him, he accused him that he\ndid not pray to God for their deliverance from the miseries they now lay\nunder, but saw them so sadly destroyed by them. Hereupon Elisha promised,\nthat the very next day, at the very same hour in which the king came to\nhim, they should have great plenty of food, and that two seahs of barley\nshould be sold in the market for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour should\nbe sold for a shekel. This prediction made Joram, and those that were present,\nvery joyful, for they did not scruple believing what the prophet said,\non account of the experience they had of the truth of his former predictions;\nand the expectation of plenty made the want they were in that day, with\nthe uneasiness that accompanied it, appear a light thing to them: but the\ncaptain of the third band, who was a friend of the king, and on whose hand\nthe king leaned, said, \"Thou talkest of incredible things, O prophet!\nfor as it is impossible for God to pour down torrents of barley, or fine\nflour, out of heaven, so is it impossible that what thou sayest should\ncome to pass.\" To which the prophet made this reply,\" Thou shalt\nsee these things come to pass, but thou shalt not be in the least a partaker\nof them.\""}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This law of the Jews, for the exclusion of lepers out of the camp in the\nwilderness, and out of the cities in Judea, is a known one, Leviticus 13:46;\nNumbers 5:14."}, "#text": "Now what Elisha had thus foretold came to pass in the manner following:\nThere was a law at Samaria \nthat those that had the leprosy, and whose bodies were not cleansed from\nit, should abide without the city: and there were four men that on this\naccount abode before the gates, while nobody gave them any food, by reason\nof the extremity of the famine; and as they were prohibited from entering\ninto the city by the law, and they considered that if they were permitted\nto enter, they should miserably perish by the famine; as also, that if\nthey staid where they were, they should suffer in the same manner,  they\nresolved to deliver themselves up to the enemy, that in case they should\nspare them, they should live; but if they should be killed, that would\nbe an easy death. So when they had confirmed this their resolution, they\ncame by night to the enemy's camp. Now God had begun to affright and disturb\nthe Syrians, and to bring the noise of chariots and armor to their ears,\nas though an army were coming upon them, and had made them suspect that\nit was coming nearer and nearer to them. In short, they were in such a dread\nof this army, that they left their tents, and ran together to Benhadad,\nand said that Joram the king of Israel had hired for auxiliaries both the\nking of Egypt and the king of the Islands, and led them against them for\nthey heard the noise of them as they were coming. And Benhadad believed\nwhat they said (for there came the same noise to his ears as well as it\ndid to theirs); so they fell into a mighty disorder and tumult, and left\ntheir horses and beasts in their camp, with immense riches also, and betook\nthemselves to flight. And those lepers who had departed from Samaria, and\nwere gone to the camp of the Syrians, of whom we made mention a little\nbefore, when they were in the camp, saw nothing but great quietness and\nsilence: accordingly they entered into it, and went hastily into one of\ntheir tents; and when they saw nobody there, they eat and drank, and carried\ngarments, and a great quantity of gold, and hid it out of the camp; after\nwhich they went into another tent, and carried off what was in it, as they\ndid at the former, and this did they for several times, without the least\ninterruption from any body. So they gathered thereby that the enemies were\ndeparted; whereupon they reproached themselves that they did not inform\nJoram and the citizens of it. So they came to the walls of Samaria, and\ncalled aloud to the watchmen, and told them in what state the enemies were,\nas did these tell the king's guards, by whose means Joram came to know\nof it; who then sent for his friends, and the captains of his host, and\nsaid to them, that \"he suspected that this departure of the king of Syria\nwas by way of ambush and treachery, and that out of despair of ruining\nyou by famine, when you imagine them to be fled away, you may come out\nof the city to spoil their camp, and he may then fall upon you on a sudden,\nand may both kill you, and take the city without fighting; whence it is\nthat I exhort you to guard the city carefully, and by no means to go out\nof it, or proudly to despise your enemies, as though they were really gone\naway.\" And when a certain person said that he did very well and wisely\nto admit such a suspicion, but that he still advised him to send a couple\nof horsemen to search all the country as far as Jordan, that \"if they\nwere seized by an ambush of the enemy, they might be a security to your\narmy, that they may not go out as if they suspected nothing, nor undergo\nthe like misfortune; and,\" said he, \"those horsemen may be numbered\namong those that have died by the famine, supposing they be caught and\ndestroyed by the enemy.\" So the king was pleased with this opinion,\nand sent such as might search out the truth, who performed their journey\nover a road that was without any enemies, but found it full of provisions,\nand of weapons, that they had therefore thrown away, and left behind them,\nin order to their being light and expeditious in their flight. When the\nking heard this, he sent out the multitude to take the spoils of the camp;\nwhich gains of theirs were not of things of small value, but they took\na great quantity of gold, and a great quantity of silver, and flocks of\nall kinds of cattle. They also possessed themselves of [so many] ten thousand\nmeasures of wheat and barley, as they never in the least dreamed of; and\nwere not only freed from their former miseries, but had such plenty, that\ntwo seahs of barley were bought for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour\nfor a shekel, according to the prophecy of Elisha. Now a seah is equal\nto an Italian modius and a half.

So when he had said this, he went away hastily out of\nthe chamber, and endeavored not to be seen by any of the army.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Spanheim here notes, that this putting off men's garments, and strewing\nthem under a king, was an Eastern custom, which he had elsewhere explained."}, "#text": "But Jehu came out, and went to the place where he before sat with\nthe captains; and when they asked him, and desired him to tell them, wherefore\nit was that this young man came to him, and added withal that he was mad,\nhe replied, \"You guess right, for the words he spake were the words of\na madman;\" and when they were eager about the matter, and desired\nhe would tell them, he answered, that God had said he had chosen him to\nbe king over the multitude. When he had said this, every one of them put\noff his garment, \nand strewed it under him, and blew with trumpets, and gave notice that\nJehu was king. So when he had gotten the army together, he was preparing\nto set out immediately against Joram, at the city Jezreel, in which city,\nas we said before, he was healing of the wound which he had received in\nthe siege of Ramoth. It happened also that Ahaziah, king of Jerusalem,\nwas now come to Joram, for he was his sister's son, as we have said already,\nto see how he did after his wound, and this upon account of their kindred;\nbut as Jehu was desirous to fall upon Joram, and those with him, on the\nsudden, he desired that none of the soldiers might run away and tell to\nJoram what had happened, for that this would be an evident demonstration\nof their kindness to him, and would show that their real inclinations were\nto make him king."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Our copies say that this \"driving of the chariots was like the driving\nof Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously,\" 2 Kings 9:20;\nwhereas Josephus's copy, as he understood it, was this, that, on the contrary,\nJehu marched slowly, and in good order. Nor can it be denied, that since\nthere was interval enough for king Joram to send out two horsemen, one\nafter another, to Jehu, and at length to go out with king Ahaziah to meet\nhim, and all this after he was come within sight of the watchman, and before\nhe was come to Jezreel, the probability is greatly on the side of Josephus's\ncopy or interpretation."}, "#text": "So they were pleased with what he did, and guarded the roads, lest\nsomebody should privately tell the thing to those that were at Jezreel.\nNow Jehu took his choice horsemen, and sat upon his chariot, and went on\nfor Jezreel; and when he was come near, the watchman whom Joram had set\nthere to spy out such as came to the city, saw Jehu marching on, and told\nJoram that he saw a troop of horsemen marching on. Upon which he immediately\ngave orders, that one of his horsemen should be sent out to meet them,\nand to know who it was that was coming. So when the horseman came up to\nJehu, he asked him in what condition the army was, for that the king wanted\nto know it; but Jehu bid him not at all to meddle with such matters, but\nto follow him. When the watchman saw this, he told Joram that the horseman\nhad mingled himself among the company, and came along with them. And when\nthe king had sent a second messenger, Jehu commanded him to do as the former\ndid; and as soon as the watchman told this also to Joram, he at last got\nupon his chariot himself, together with Ahaziah, the king of Jerusalem;\nfor, as we said before, he was there to see how Joram did, after he had\nbeen wounded, as being his relation. So he went out to meet Jehu, who marched\nslowly, \nand in good order; and when Joram met him in the field of Naboth, he asked\nhim if all things were well in the camp; but Jehu reproached him bitterly,\nand ventured to call his mother a witch and a harlot. Upon this the king,\nfearing what he intended, and suspecting he had no good meaning, turned\nhis chariot about as soon as he could, and said to Ahaziah, \"We are\nfought against by deceit and treachery.\" But Jehu drew his bow, and\nsmote him, the arrow going through his heart: so Joram fell down immediately\non his knee, and gave up the ghost. Jehu also gave orders to Bidkar, the\ncaptain of the third part of his army, to cast the dead body of Joram into\nthe field of Naboth, putting him in mind of the prophecy which Elijah prophesied\nto Ahab his father, when he had slain Naboth, that both he and his family\nshould perish in that place; for that as they sat behind Ahab's chariot,\nthey heard the prophet say so, and that it was now come to pass according\nto his prophecy. Upon the fall of Joram, Ahaziah was afraid of his own\nlife, and turned his chariot into another road, supposing he should not\nbe seen by Jehu; but he followed after him, and overtook him at a certain\nacclivity, and drew his bow, and wounded him; so he left his chariot, and\ngot upon his horse, and fled from Jehu to Megiddo; and though he was under\ncure, in a little time he died of that wound, and was carried to Jerusalem,\nand buried there, after he had reigned one year, and had proved a wicked\nman, and worse than his father."}, "Now when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel adorned herself and stood\nupon a tower, and said, he was a fine servant that had killed his master!\nAnd when he looked up to her, he asked who she was, and commanded her to\ncome down to him. At last he ordered the eunuchs to throw her down from\nthe tower; and being thrown down, she be-sprinkled the wall with her blood,\nand was trodden upon by the horses, and so died. When this was done, Jehu\ncame to the palace with his friends, and took some refreshment after his\njourney, both with other things, and by eating a meal. He also bid his\nservants to take up Jezebel and bury her, because of the nobility of her\nblood, for she was descended from kings; but those that were appointed\nto bury her found nothing else remaining but the extreme parts of her body,\nfor all the rest were eaten by dogs. When Jehu heard this, he admired the\nprophecy of Elijah, for he foretold that she should perish in this manner\nat Jezreel.", "Now Ahab had seventy sons brought up in Samaria. So Jehu sent two\nepistles, the one to them that brought up the children, the other to the\nrulers of Samaria, which said, that they should set up the most valiant\nof Ahab's sons for king, for that they had abundance of chariots, and horses,\nand armor, and a great army, and fenced cities, and that by so doing they\nmight avenge the murder of Ahab. This he wrote to try the intentions of\nthose of Samaria. Now when the rulers, and those that had brought up the\nchildren, had read the letter, they were afraid; and considering that they\nwere not at all able to oppose him, who had already subdued two very great\nkings, they returned him this answer: That they owned him for their lord,\nand would do whatsoever he bade them. So he wrote back to them such a reply\nas enjoined them to obey what he gave order for, and to cut off the heads\nof Ahab's sons, and send them to him. Accordingly the rulers sent for those\nthat brought up the sons of Ahab, and commanded them to slay them, to cut\noff their heads, and send them to Jehu. So they did whatsoever they were\ncommanded, without omitting any thing at all, and put them up in wicker\nbaskets, and sent them to Jezreel. And when Jehu, as he was at supper with\nhis friends, was informed that the heads of Ahab's' sons were brought,\nhe ordered them to make two heaps of them, one before each of the gates;\nand in the morning he went out to take a view of them, and when he saw\nthem, he began to say to the people that were present, that he did himself\nmake an expedition against his master [Joram], and slew him, but that it\nwas not he that slew all these; and he desired them to take notice, that\nas to Ahab's family, all things had come to pass according to God's prophecy,\nand his house was perished, according as Elijah had foretold. And when\nhe had further destroyed all the kindred of Ahab that were found in Jezreel,\nhe went to Samaria; and as he was upon the road, he met the relations of\nAhaziah king of Jerusalem, and asked them whither they were going? they\nreplied, that they came to salute Joram, and their own king Ahaziah, for\nthey knew not that he had slain them both. So Jehu gave orders that they\nshould catch these, and kill them, being in number forty-two persons.", "After these, there met him a good and a righteous man, whose name\nwas Jehonadab, and who had been his friend of old. He saluted Jehu, and\nbegan to commend him, because he had done every thing according to the\nwill of God, in extirpating the house of Ahab. So Jehu desired him to come\nup into his chariot, and make his entry with him into Samaria; and told\nhim that he would not spare one wicked man, but would punish the false\nprophets, and false priests, and those that deceived the multitude, and\npersuaded them to leave the worship of God Almighty, and to worship foreign\ngods; and that it was a most excellent and most pleasing sight to a good\nand a righteous man to see the wicked punished. So Jehonadab was persuaded\nby these arguments, and came up into Jehu's chariot, and came to Samaria.\nAnd Jehu sought out for all Ahab's kindred, and slew them. And being desirous\nthat none of the false prophets, nor the priests of Ahab's god, might escape\npunishment, he caught them deceitfully by this wile; for he gathered all\nthe people together, and said that he would worship twice as many gods\nas Ahab worshipped, and desired that his priests, and prophets, and servants\nmight be present, because he would offer costly and great sacrifices to\nAhab's god; and that if any of his priests were wanting, they should be\npunished with death. Now Ahab's god was called Baal; and when he had appointed\na day on which he would offer those sacrifices, he sent messengers through\nall the country of the Israelites, that they might bring the priests of\nBaal to him. So Jehu commanded to give all the priests vestments; and when\nthey had received them, he went into the house [of Baal], with his friend\nJehonadab, and gave orders to make search whether there were not any foreigner\nor stranger among them, for he would have no one of a different religion\nto mix among their sacred offices. And when they said that there was no\nstranger there, and they were beginning their sacrifices, he set fourscore\nmen without, they being such of his soldiers as he knew to be most faithful\nto him, and bid them slay the prophets, and now vindicate the laws of their\ncountry, which had been a long time in disesteem. He also threatened, that\nif any one of them escaped, their own lives should go for them. So they\nslew them all with the sword, and burnt the house of Baal, and by that\nmeans purged Samaria of foreign customs [idolatrous worship]. Now this\nBaal was the god of the Tyrians; and Ahab, in order to gratify his father-in-law,\nEthbaal, who was the king of Tyre and Sidon, built a temple for him in\nSamaria, and appointed him prophets, and worshipped him with all sorts\nof worship, although, when this god was demolished, Jehu permitted the\nIsraelites to worship the golden heifers. However, because he had done\nthus, and taken care to punish the wicked, God foretold by his prophet\nthat his .sons should reign over Israel for four generations. And in this\ncondition was Jehu at this time.", "Now when Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab, heard of the death of her\nbrother Joram, and of her son Ahaziah, and of the royal family, she endeavored\nthat none of the house of David might be left alive, but that the whole\nfamily might be exterminated, that no king might arise out of it afterward;\nand, as she thought, she had actually done it; but one of Ahaziah's sons\nwas preserved, who escaped death after the manner following: Ahaziah had\na sister by the same father, whose name was Jehosheba, and she was married\nto the high priest Jehoiada. She went into the king's palace, and found\nJehoash, for that was the little child's name, who was not above a year\nold, among those that were slain, but concealed with his nurse; so she\ntook him with her into a secret bed-chamber, and shut him up there, and\nshe and her husband Jehoiada brought him up privately in the temple six\nyears, during which time Athaliah reigned over Jerusalem and the two tribes.", "Now, on the Seventh year, Jehoiada communicated the matter to certain\nof the captains of hundreds, five in number, and persuaded them to be assisting\nto what attempts he was making against Athaliah, and to join with him in\nasserting the kingdom to the child. He also received such oaths from them\nas are proper to secure those that assist one another from the fear of\ndiscovery; and he was then of good hope that they should depose Athaliah.\nNow those men whom Jehoiada the priest had taken to be his partners went\ninto all the country, and gathered together the priests and the Levites,\nand the heads of the tribes out of it, and came and brought them to Jerusalem\nto the high priest. So he demanded the security of an oath of them, to\nkeep private whatsoever he should discover to them, which required both\ntheir silence and their assistance. So when they had taken the oath, and\nhad thereby made it safe for him to speak, he produced the child that he\nhad brought up of the family of David, and said to them, \"This is\nyour king, of that house which you know God hath foretold should reign\nover you for all time to come. I exhort you therefore that one-third part\nof you guard him in the temple, and that a fourth part keep watch at all\nthe gates of the temple, and that the next part of you keep guard at the\ngate which opens and leads to the king's palace, and let the rest of the\nmultitude be unarmed in the temple, and let no armed person go into the\ntemple, but the priest only.\" He also gave them this order besides,\n\"That a part of the priests and the Levites should be about the king\nhimself, and be a guard to him, with their drawn swords, and to kill that\nman immediately, whoever he be, that should be so bold as to enter armed\ninto the temple; and bid them be afraid of nobody, but persevere in guarding\nthe king.\" So these men obeyed what the high priest advised them to,\nand declared the reality of their resolution by their actions. Jehoiada\nalso opened that armory which David had made in the temple, and distributed\nto the captains of hundreds, as also to the priests and Levites, all the\nspears and quivers, and what kind of weapons soever it contained, and set\nthem armed in a circle round about the temple, so as to touch one another's\nhands, and by that means excluding those from entering that ought not to\nenter. So they brought the child into the midst of them, and put on him\nthe royal crown, and Jehoiada anointed him with the oil, and made him king;\nand the multitude rejoiced, and made a noise, and cried, \"God save\nthe king!\"", "When Athaliah unexpectedly heard the tumult and the acclamations,\nshe was greatly disturbed in her mind, and suddenly issued out of the royal\npalace with her own army; and when she was come to the temple, the. priests\nreceived her; but as for those that stood round about the temple, as they\nwere ordered by the high priest to do, they hindered the armed inert that\nfollowed her from going in. But when Athaliah saw the child standing upon\na pillar, with the royal crown upon his head, she rent her clothes, and\ncried out vehemently, and commanded [her guards] to kill him that had laid\nsnares for her, and endeavored to deprive her of the government. But Jehoiada\ncalled for the captains of hundreds, and commanded them to bring Athaliah\nto the valley of Cedron, and slay her there, for he would not have the\ntemple defiled with the punishments of this pernicious woman; and he gave\norder, that if any one came near to help her, he should be slain also;\nwherefore those that had the charge of her slaughter took hold of her,\nand led her to the gate of the king's mules, arid slew her there.", "Now as soon as what concerned Athaliah was by this stratagem, after\nthis manner, despatched, Jehoiada called together the people and the armed\nmen into the temple, and made them take an oath that they would be obedient\nto the king, and take care of his safety, and of the safety of his government;\nafter which he obliged the king to give security [upon oath] that he would\nworship God, and not transgress the laws of Moses. They then ran to the\nhouse of Baal, which Athaliah and her husband Jehoram had built, to the\ndishonor of the God of their fathers, and to the honor of Ahab, and demolished\nit, and slew Mattan, that had his priesthood. But Jehoiada intrusted the\ncare and custody of the temple to the priests and Levites, according to\nthe appointment of king David, and enjoined them to bring their regular\nburnt-offerings twice a day, and to offer incense according to the law.\nHe also ordained some of the Levites, with the porters, to be a guard to\nthe temple, that no one that was defiled might come there.", "And when Jehoiada had set these things in order, he, with the captains\nof hundreds, and the rulers, and all the people, took Jehoash out of the\ntemple into the king's palace; and when he had set him upon the king's\nthrone, the people shouted for joy, and betook themselves to feasting,\nand kept a festival for many days; but the city was quiet upon the death\nof Athaliah. Now Jehoash was seven years old when he took the kingdom.\nHis mother's name was Zibiah, of the city Beersheba. And all the time that\nJehoiada lived Jehoash was careful that the laws should be kept, and very\nzealous in the worship of God; and when he was of age, he married two wives,\nwho were given to him by the high priest, by whom were born to him both\nsons and daughters. And thus much shall suffice to have related concerning\nking Jehoash, how he escaped the treachery of Athaliah, and how he received\nthe kingdom.", "NOW Hazael, king of Syria, fought against the Israelites and their\nking Jehu, and spoiled the eastern parts of the country beyond Jordan,\nwhich belonged to the Reubenites and Gadites, and to [the half tribe of]\nManassites; as also Gilead and Bashan, burning, and spoiling, and offering\nviolence to all that he laid his hands on, and this without impeachment\nfrom Jehu, who made no haste to defend the country when it was under this\ndistress; nay, he was become a contemner of religion, and a despiser of\nholiness, and of the laws, and died when he had reigned over the Israelites\ntwenty-seven years. He was buried in Samaria, and left Jehoahaz his son\nhis successor in the government.", "Now Jehoash, king of Jerusalem, had an inclination to repair the\ntemple of God; so he called Jehoiada, and bid him send the Levites and\npriests through all the country, to require half a shekel of silver for\nevery head, towards the rebuilding and repairing of the temple, which was\nbrought to decay by Jehoram, and Athaliah and her sons. But the high priest\ndid not do this, as concluding that no one would willingly pay that money;\nbut in the twenty-third year of Jehoash's reign, when the king sent for\nhim and the Levites, and complained that they had not obeyed what he enjoined\nthem, and still commanded them to take care of the rebuilding the temple,\nhe used this stratagem for collecting the money, with which the multitude\nwas pleased. He made a wooden chest, and closed it up fast on all sides,\nbut opened one hole in it; he then set it in the temple beside the altar,\nand desired every one to cast into it, through the hole, what he pleased,\nfor the repair of the temple. This contrivance was acceptable to the people,\nand they strove one with another, and brought in jointly large quantities\nof silver and gold; and when the scribe and the priest that were over the\ntreasuries had emptied the chest, and counted the money in the king's presence,\nthey then set it in its former place, and thus did they every day. But\nwhen the multitude appeared to have cast in as much as was wanted, the\nhigh priest Jehoiada, and king Joash, sent to hire masons and carpenters,\nand to buy large pieces of timber, and of the most curious sort; and when\nthey had repaired the temple, they made use of the remaining gold and silver,\nwhich was not a little, for bowls, and basons, and cups, and other vessels,\nand they went on to make the altar every day fat with sacrifices of great\nvalue. And these things were taken suitable care of as long as Jehoiada\nlived.", "But as soon as he was dead (which was when he had lived one hundred\nand thirty years, having been a righteous, and in every respect a very\ngood man, and was buried in the king's sepulchers at Jerusalem, because\nhe had recovered the kingdom to the family of David) king Jehoash betrayed\nhis [want of] care about God. The principal men of the people were corrupted\nalso together with him, and offended against their duty, and what their\nconstitution determined to be most for their good. Hereupon God was displeased\nwith the change that was made on the king, and on the rest of the people,\nand sent prophets to testify to them what their actions were, and to bring\nthem to leave off their wickedness; but they had gotten such a strong affection\nand so violent an inclination to it, that neither could the examples of\nthose that had offered affronts to the laws, and had been so severely punished,\nthey and their entire families, nor could the fear of what the prophets\nnow foretold, bring them to repentance, and turn them back from their course\nof transgression to their former duty. But the king commanded that Zechariah,\nthe son of the high priest Jehoiada, should be stoned to death in the temple,\nand forgot the kindnesses he had received from his father; for when God\nhad appointed him to prophesy, he stood in the midst of the multitude,\nand gave this counsel to them and to the king: That they should act righteously;\nand foretold to them, that if they would not hearken to his admonitions,\nthey should suffer a heavy punishment. But as Zechariah was ready to die,\nhe appealed to God as a witness of what he suffered for the good counsel\nhe had given them, and how he perished after a most severe and violent\nmanner for the good deeds his father had done to Jehoash.", "However, it was not long before the king suffered punishment for\nhis transgression; for when Hazael, king of Syria, made an irruption into\nhis country, and when he had overthrown Gath, and spoiled it, he made an\nexpedition against Jerusalem; upon which Jehoash was afraid, and emptied\nall the treasures of God and of the kings [before him], and took down the\ngifts that had been dedicated [in the temple], and sent them to the king\nof Syria, and procured so much by them, that he was not besieged, nor his\nkingdom quite endangered; but Hazael was induced by the greatness of the\nsum of money not to bring his army against Jerusalem; yet Jehoash fell\ninto a severe distemper, and was set upon by his friends, in order to revenge\nthe death of Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada. These laid snares for the\nking, and slew him. He was indeed buried in Jerusalem, but not in the royal\nsepulchers of his forefathers, because of his impiety. He lived forty-seven\nyears, and Amaziah his son succeeded him in the kingdom.", "In the one and twentieth year of the reign of Jehoash, Jehoahaz,\nthe son of Jehu, took the government of the Israelites in Samaria, and\nheld it seventeen years. He did not [properly] imitate his father, but\nwas guilty of as wicked practices as hose that first had God in contempt:\nbut the king of Syria brought him low, and by an expedition against him\ndid so greatly reduce his forces, that there remained no more of so great\nan army than ten thousand armed men, and fifty horsemen. He also took away\nfrom him his great cities, and many of them also, and destroyed his army.\nAnd these were the things that the people of Israel suffered, according\nto the prophecy of Elisha, when he foretold that Hazael should kill his\nmaster, and reign over the Syrians and Damcenes. But when Jehoahaz was\nunder such unavoidable miseries, he had recourse to prayer and supplication\nto God, and besought him to deliver him out of the hands of Hazael, and\nnot overlook him, and give him up into his hands. Accordingly God accepted\nof his repentance instead of virtue; and being desirous rather to admonish\nthose that might repent, and not to determine that they should be utterly\ndestroyed, he granted him deliverance from war and dangers. So the country\nhaving obtained peace, returned again to its former condition, and flourished\nas before.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This character of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, that \"he was a good\nman, and in his disposition not at all like to his father,\" seems\na direct contradiction to our ordinary copies, which say (2 Kings 13:11)\nthat \"he did evil in the sight of the Lord; and that he departed not\nfrom all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:\nhe walked therein.\" Which copies are here the truest it is hard positively\nto determine. If Josephus's be true, this Joash is the single instance\nof a good king over the ten tribes; if the other be true, we have not one\nsuch example. The account that follows, in all copies, of Elisha the prophet's\nconcern for him, and his concern for Elisha, greatly favors Josephus's\ncopies, and supposes this king to have been then a good man, and no idolater,\nwith whom God's prophets used not to be so familiar. Upon the whole, since\nit appears, even by Josephus's own account, that Amaziah, the good king\nof Judah, while he was a good king, was forbidden to make use of the hundred\nthousand auxiliaries he had hired of this Joash, the king of Israel, as\nif he and they were then idolaters, 2 Chronicles 25:6-9, it is most likely\nthat these different characters of Joash suited the different parts of\nhis reign, and that, according to our common copies, he was at first a\nwicked king, and afterwards was reclaimed, and became a good one, according\nto Josephus."}, "#text": "Now after the death of Jehoahaz, his son Joash took the kingdom,\nin the thirty-seventh year of Jehoash, the king of the tribe of Judah.\nThis Joash then took the kingdom of Israel in Samaria, for he had the same\nname with the king of Jerusalem, and he retained the kingdom sixteen years.\nHe was a good man, \nand in his disposition was not at all like his father. Now at this time\nit was that when Elisha the prophet, who was already very old, and was\nnow fallen into a disease, the king of Israel came to visit him; and when\nhe found him very near death, he began to weep in his sight, and lament,\nto call him his father, and his weapons, because it was by his means that\nhe never made use of his weapons against his enemies, but that he overcame\nhis own adversaries by his prophecies, without fighting; and that he was\nnow departing this life, and leaving him to the Syrians, that were already\narmed, and to other enemies of his that were under their power; so he said\nit was not safe for him to live any longer, but that it would be well for\nhim to hasten to his end, and depart out of this life with him. As the\nking was thus bemoaning himself, Elisha comforted him, and bid the king\nbend a bow that was brought him; and when the king had fitted the bow for\nshooting, Elisha took hold of his hands and bid him shoot; and when he\nhad shot three arrows, and then left off, Elisha said, \"If thou hadst\nshot more arrows, thou hadst cut the kingdom of Syria up by the roots;\nbut since thou hast been satisfied with shooting three times only, thou\nshalt fight and beat the Syrians no more times than three, that thou mayst\nrecover that country which they cut off from thy kingdom in the reign of\nthy father.\" So when the king had heard that, he departed; and a little\nwhile after the prophet died. He was a man celebrated for righteousness,\nand in eminent favor with God. He also performed wonderful and surprising\nworks by prophecy, and such as were gloriously preserved in memory by the\nHebrews. He also obtained a magnificent funeral, such a one indeed as it\nwas fit a person so beloved of God should have. It also happened, that\nat that time certain robbers cast a man whom they had slain into Elisha's\ngrave, and upon his dead body coming close to Elisha's body, it revived\nagain. And thus far have we enlarged about the actions of Elisha the prophet,\nboth such as he did while he was alive, and how he had a Divine power after\nhis death also."}, "Now, upon the death of Hazael, the king of Syria, that kingdom came\nto Adad his son, with whom Joash, king of Israel, made war; and when he\nhad beaten him in three battles, he took from him all that country, and\nall those cities and villages, which his father Hazael had taken from the\nkingdom of Israel, which came to pass, however, according to the prophecy\nof Elisha. But when Joash happened to die, he was buried in Samaria, and\nthe government devolved on his son Jeroboam.", "Now, in the second year of the reign of Joash over Israel, Amaziah\nreigned over the tribe of Judah in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan,\nwho was born at Jerusalem. He was exceeding careful of doing what was right,\nand this when he was very young; but when he came to the management of\naffairs, and to the government, he resolved that he ought first of all\nto avenge his father Je-hoash, and to punish those his friends that had\nlaid violent hands upon him: so he seized upon them all, and put them to\ndeath; yet did he execute no severity on their children, but acted therein\naccording to the laws of Moses, who did not think it just to punish children\nfor the sins of their fathers. After this he chose him an army out of the\ntribe of Judah and Benjamin, of such as were in the flower of their age,\nand about twenty years old; and when he had collected about three hundred\nthousand of them together, he set captains of hundreds over them. He also\nsent to the king of Israel, and hired a hundred thousand of his soldiers\nfor a hundred talents of silver, for he had resolved to make an expedition\nagainst the nations of the Amatekites, and Edomites, and Gebalites: but\nas he was preparing for his expedition, and ready to go out to the war,\na prophet gave him counsel to dismiss the army of the Israelites, because\nthey were bad men, and because God foretold that he should be beaten, if\nhe made use of them as auxiliaries; but that he should overcome his enemies,\nthough he had but a few soldiers, when it so pleased God. And when the\nking grudged at his having already paid the hire of the Israelites, the\nprophet exhorted him to do what God would have him, because he should thereby\nobtain much wealth from God. So he dismissed them, and said that he still\nfreely gave them their pay, and went himself with his own army, and made\nwar with the nations before mentioned; and when he had beaten them in battle,\nhe slew of them ten thousand, and took as many prisoners alive, whom he\nbrought to the great rock which is in Arabia, and threw them down from\nit headlong. He also brought away a great deal of prey and vast riches\nfrom those nations. But while Amaziah was engaged in this expedition, those\nIsraelites whom he had hired, and then dismissed, were very uneasy at it,\nand taking their dismission for an affront, (as supposing that this would\nnot have been done to them but out of contempt,) they fell upon his kingdom,\nand proceeded to spoil the country as far as Beth-horon, and took much\ncattle, and slew three thousand men.", "Now upon the victory which Amaziah had gotten, and the great acts\nhe had done, he was puffed up, and began to overlook God, who had given\nhim the victory, and proceeded to worship the gods he had brought out of\nthe country of the Amalekites. So a prophet came to him, and said, that\nhe wondered how he could esteem these to be gods, who had been of no advantage\nto their own people who paid them honors, nor had delivered them from his\nhands, but had overlooked the destruction of many of them, and had suffered\nthemselves to be carried captive, for that they had been carried to Jerusalem\nin the same manner as any one might have taken some of the enemy alive,\nand led them thither. This reproof provoked the king to anger, and he commanded\nthe prophet to hold his peace, and threatened to punish him if he meddled\nwith his conduct. So he replied, that he should indeed hold his peace;\nbut foretold withal, that God would not overlook his attempts for innovation.\nBut Amaziah was not able to contain himself under that prosperity which\nGod had given him, although he had affronted God thereupon; but in a vein\nof insolence he wrote to Joash, the king of Israel, and commanded that\nhe and all his people should be obedient to him, as they had formerly been\nobedient to his progenitors, David and Solomon; and he let him know, that\nif he would not be so wise as to do what he commanded him, he must fight\nfor his dominion. To which message Joash returned this answer in writing:\n\"King Joash to king Amaziah. There was a vastly tall cypress tree\nin Mount Lebanon, as also a thistle; this thistle sent to the cypress tree\nto give the cypress tree's daughter in marriage to the thistle's son; but\nas the thistle was saying this, there came a wild beast, and trod down\nthe thistle: and this may be a lesson to thee, not to be so ambitious,\nand to have a care, lest upon thy good success in the fight against the\nAmalekites thou growest so proud, as to bring dangers upon thyself and\nupon thy kingdom.\"", "When Amaziah had read this letter, he was more eager upon this expedition,\nwhich, I suppose, was by the impulse of God, that he might be punished\nfor his offense against him. But as soon as he led out his army against\nJoash, and they were going to join battle with him, there came such a fear\nand consternation upon the army of Amaziah, as God, when he is displeased,\nsends upon men, and discomfited them, even before they came to a close\nfight. Now it happened, that as they were scattered about by the terror\nthat was upon them, Amaziah was left alone, and was taken prisoner by the\nenemy; whereupon Joash threatened to kill him, unless he would persuade\nthe people of Jerusalem to open their gates to him, and receive him and\nhis army into the city. Accordingly Amaziah was so distressed, and in such\nfear of his life, that he made his enemy to be received into the city.\nSo Joash over threw a part of the wall, of the length of four hundred cubits,\nand drove his chariot through the breach into Jerusalem, and led Amaziah\ncaptive along with him; by which means he became master of Jerusalem, and\ntook away the treasures of God, and carried off all the gold and silver\nthat was in the king's palace, and then freed the king from captivity,\nand returned to Samaria. Now these things happened to the people of Jerusalem\nin the fourteenth year of the reign of Amaziah, who after this had a conspiracy\nmade against him by his friends, and fled to the city Lachish, and was\nthere slain by the conspirators, who sent men thither to kill him. So they\ntook up his dead body, and carried it to Jerusalem, and made a royal funeral\nfor him. This was the end of the life of Amaziah, because of his innovations\nin religion, and his contempt of God, when he had lived fifty-four years,\nand had reigned twenty-nine.

Accordingly there were slain by the Israelites one\nhundred and twenty thousand of his men that day, whose general, Amaziah\nby name, slew Zechariah the king's son, in his conflict with Ahaz, as well\nas the governor of the kingdom, whose name was Azricam.

Now this king, upon the reception of those ambassadors,\ncame to assist Ahaz, and made war upon the Syrians, and laid their country\nwaste, and took Damascus by force, and slew Rezin their king, and transplanted\nthe people of Damascus into the Upper Media, and brought a colony of Assyrians,\nand planted them in Damascus.

Now\nthis king was so sottish and thoughtless of what was for his own good,\nthat he would not leave off worshipping the Syrian gods when he was beaten\nby them, but he went on in worshipping them, as though they would procure\nhim the victory; and when he was beaten again, he began to honor the gods\nof the Assyrians; and he seemed more desirous to honor any other gods than\nhis own paternal and true God, whose anger was the cause of his defeat;\nnay, he proceeded to such a degree of despite and contempt [of God's worship],\nthat he shut up the temple entirely, and forbade them to bring in the appointed\nsacrifices, and took away the gifts that had been given to it. And when\nhe had offered these indignities to God, he died, having lived thirty-six\nyears, and of them reigned sixteen; and he left his son Hezekiah for his\nsuccessor.", "ABOUT the same time Pekah, the king of Israel, died by the treachery\nof a friend of his, whose name was Hoshea, who retained the kingdom nine\nyears' time, but was a wicked man, and a despiser of the Divine worship;\nand Shalmaneser, the king of Assyria, made an expedition against him, and\novercame him, (which must have been because he had not God favorable nor\nassistant to him,) and brought him to submission, and ordered him to pay\nan appointed tribute. Now, in the fourth year of the reign of Hoshea, Hezekiah,\nthe son of Ahaz, began to reign in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was\nAbijah, a citizen of Jerusalem. His nature was good, and righteous, and\nreligious; for when he came to the kingdom, he thought that nothing was\nprior, or more necessary, or more advantageous to himself, and to his subjects,\nthan to worship God. Accordingly, he called the people together, and the\npriests, and the Levites, and made a speech to them, and said, \"You\nare not ignorant how, by the sins of my father, who transgressed that sacred\nhonor which was due to God, you have had experience of many and great miseries,\nwhile you were corrupted in your mind by him, and were induced to worship\nthose which he supposed to be gods; I exhort you, therefore, who have learned\nby sad experience how dangerous a thing impiety is, to put that immediately\nout of your memory, and to purify yourselves from your former pollutions,\nand to open the temple to these priests and Levites who are here convened,\nand to cleanse it with the accustomed sacrifices, and to recover all to\nthe ancient honor which our fathers paid to it; for by this means we may\nrender God favorable, and he will remit the anger he hath had to us.\"", "When the king had said this, the priests opened the temple; and when\nthey had set in order the vessels of God, and east out what was impure,\nthey laid the accustomed sacrifices upon the altar. The king also sent\nto the country that was under him, and called the people to Jerusalem to\ncelebrate the feast of unleavened bread, for it had been intermitted a\nlong time, on account of the wickedness of the forementioned kings. He\nalso sent to the Israelites, and exhorted them to leave off their present\nway of living, and return to their ancient practices, and to worship God,\nfor that he gave them leave to come to Jerusalem, and to celebrate, all\nin one body, the feast of unleavened bread; and this he said was by way\nof invitation only, and to be done of their own good-will, and for their\nown advantage, and not out of obedience to him, because it would make them\nhappy. But the Israelites, upon the coming of the ambassadors, and upon\ntheir laying before them what they had in charge from their own king, were\nso far from complying therewith, that they laughed the ambassadors to scorn,\nand mocked them as fools: as also they affronted the prophets, which gave\nthem the same exhortations, and foretold what they would suffer if they\ndid not return to the worship of God, insomuch that at length they caught\nthem, and slew them; nor did this degree of transgressing suffice them,\nbut they had more wicked contrivances than what have been described: nor\ndid they leave off, before God, as a punishment for their impiety, brought\nthem under their enemies: but of that more hereafter. However, many there\nwere of the tribe of Manasseh, and of Zebulon, and of Issachar, who were\nobedient to what the prophets exhorted them to do, and returned to the\nworship of God. Now all these came running to Jerusalem, to Hezekiah, that\nthey might worship God [there].", "When these men were come, king Hezekiah went up into the temple,\nwith the rulers and all the people, and offered for himself seven bulls,\nand as many rams, with seven lambs, and as many kids of the goats. The\nking also himself, and the rulers, laid their hands on the heads of the\nsacrifices, and permitted the priests to complete the sacred offices about\nthem. So they both slew the sacrifices, and burnt the burnt-offerings,\nwhile the Levites stood round about them, with their musical instruments,\nand sang hymns to God, and played on their psalteries, as they were instructed\nby David to do, and this while the rest of the priests returned the music,\nand sounded the trumpets which they had in their hands; and when this was\ndone, the king and the multitude threw themselves down upon their face,\nand worshipped God. He also sacrificed seventy bulls, one hundred rams,\nand two hundred lambs. He also granted the multitude sacrifices to feast\nupon, six hundred oxen, and three thousand other cattle; and the priests\nperformed all things according to the law. Now the king was so pleased\nherewith, that he feasted with the people, and returned thanks to God;\nbut as the feast of unleavened bread was now come, when they had offered\nthat sacrifice which is called the passover, they after that offered other\nsacrifices for seven days. When the king had bestowed on the multitude,\nbesides what they sanctified of themselves, two thousand bulls, and seven\nthousand other cattle, the same thing was done by the rulers; for they\ngave them a thousand bulls, and a thousand and forty other cattle. Nor\nhad this festival been so well observed from the days of king Solomon,\nas it was now first observed with great splendor and magnificence; and\nwhen the festival was ended, they went out into the country and purged\nit, and cleansed the city of all the pollution of the idols. The king also\ngave order that the daily sacrifices should be offered, at his own charges,\nand according to the law; and appointed that the tithes and the first-fruits\nshould be given by the multitude to the priests and Levites, that they\nmight constantly attend upon Divine service, and never be taken off from\nthe worship of God. Accordingly, the multitude brought together all sorts\nof their fruits to the priests and the Levites. The king also made garners\nand receptacles for these fruits, and distributed them to every one of\nthe priests and Levites, and to their children and wives; and thus did\nthey return to their old form of Divine worship. Now when the king had\nsettled these matters after the manner already described, he made war upon\nthe Philistines, and beat them, and possessed himself of all the enemy's\ncities, from Gaza to Gath; but the king of Assyria sent to him, and threatened\nto overturn all his dominions, unless he would pay him the tribute which\nhis father paid him formerly; but king Hezekiah was not concerned at his\nthreatenings, but depended on his piety towards God, and upon Isaiah the\nprophet, by whom he inquired and accurately knew all future events.

Yet, while he was very zealous and\ndiligent about the worship of God, did he soon afterwards fall into a severe\ndistemper, insomuch that the physicians despaired of him, and expected\nno good issue of his sickness, as neither did his friends: and besides\nthe distemper \nitself, there was a very melancholy circumstance that disordered the king,\nwhich was the consideration that he was childless, and was going to die,\nand leave his house and his government without a successor of his own body;\nso he was troubled at the thoughts of this his condition, and lamented\nhimself, and entreated of God that he would prolong his life for a little\nwhile till he had some children, and not suffer him to depart this life\nbefore he was become a father. Hereupon God had mercy upon him, and accepted\nof his supplication, because the trouble he was under at his supposed death\nwas not because he was soon to leave the advantages he enjoyed in the kingdom,\nnor did he on that account pray that he might have a longer life afforded\nhim, but in order to have sons, that might receive the government after\nhim. And God sent Isaiah the prophet, and commanded him to inform Hezekiah,\nthat within three days' time he should get clear of his distemper, and\nshould survive it fifteen years, and that he should have children also.\nNow, upon the prophet's saying this, as God had commanded him, he could\nhardly believe it, both on account of the distemper he was under, which\nwas very sore, and by reason of the surprising nature of what was told\nhim; so he desired that Isaiah would give him some sign or wonder, that\nhe might believe him in what he had said, and be sensible that he came\nfrom God; for things that are beyond expectation, and greater than our\nhopes, are made credible by actions of the like nature. And when Isaiah\nhad asked him what sign he desired to be exhibited, he desired that he\nwould make the shadow of the sun, which he had already made to go down\nten steps [or degrees] in his house, to return again to the same place,\n and\nto make it as it was before. And when the prophet prayed to God to exhibit\nthis sign to the king, he saw what he desired to see, and was freed from\nhis distemper, and went up to the temple, where he worshipped God, and\nmade vows to him."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This expression of Josephus, that the Medes, upon this destruction of the\nAssyrian army, \"overthrew\" the Assyrian empire, seems to be too\nstrong; for although they immediately cast off the Assrian yoke, and set\nup Deioces, a king of their own, yet it was some time before the Medes\nand Babylonians overthrew Nineveh, and some generations ere the Medes and\nPersians under Cyaxares and Cyrus overthrew the Assyrian or Babylonian\nempire, and took Babylon."}, "#text": "At this time it was that the dominion of the Assyrians was overthrown\nby the Medes; \nbut of these things I shall treat elsewhere. But the king of Babylon, whose\nname was Baladan, sent ambassadors to Hezekiah, with presents, and desired\nhe would be his ally and his friend. So he received the ambassadors gladly,\nand made them a feast, and showed them his treasures, and his armory, and\nthe other wealth he was possessed of, in precious stones and in gold, and\ngave them presents to be carried to Baladan, and sent them back to him.\nUpon which the prophet Isaiah came to him, and inquired of him whence those\nambassadors came; to which he replied, that they came from Babylon, from\nthe king; and that he had showed them all he had, that by the sight of\nhis riches and forces he might thereby guess at [the plenty he was in],\nand be able to inform the king of it. But the prophet rejoined, and said,\n\"Know thou, that, after a little while, these riches of thine shall\nbe carried away to Babylon, and thy posterity shall be made eunuchs there,\nand lose their manhood, and be servants to the king of Babylon; for that\nGod foretold such things would come to pass.\" Upon which words Hezekiah\nwas troubled, and said that he was himself unwilling that his nation should\nfall into such calamities; yet since it is not possible to alter what God\nhad determined, he prayed that there might be peace while he lived. Berosus\nalso makes mention of this Baladan, king of Babylon. Now as to this prophet\n[Isaiah], he was by the confession of all, a divine and wonderful man in\nspeaking truth; and out of the assurance that he had never written what\nwas false, he wrote down all his prophecies, and left them behind him in\nbooks, that their accomplishment might be judged of from the events by\nposterity: nor did this prophet do so alone, but the others, which were\ntwelve in number, did the same. And whatsoever is done among us, Whether\nit be good, or whether it be bad, comes to pass according to their prophecies;\nbut of every one of these we shall speak hereafter."}, "WHEN king Hezekiah had survived the interval of time already mentioned,\nand had dwelt all that time in peace, he died, having completed fifty-four\nyears of his life, and reigned twenty-nine. But when his son Manasseh,\nwhose mother's name was Hephzibah, of Jerusalem, had taken the kingdom,\nhe departed from the conduct of his father, and fell into a course of life\nquite contrary thereto, and showed himself in his manners most wicked in\nall respects, and omitted no sort of impiety, but imitated those transgressions\nof the Israelites, by the commission of which against God they had been\ndestroyed; for he was so hardy as to defile the temple of God, and the\ncity, and the whole country; for, by setting out from a contempt of God,\nhe barbarously slew all the righteous men that were among the Hebrews;\nnor would he spare the prophets, for he every day slew some of them, till\nJerusalem was overflown with blood. So God was angry at these proceedings,\nand sent prophets to the king, and to the multitude, by whom he threatened\nthe very same calamities to them which their brethren the Israelites, upon\nthe like affronts offered to God, were now under. But these men would not\nbelieve their words, by which belief they might have reaped the advantage\nof escaping all those miseries; yet did they in earnest learn that what\nthe prophets had told them was true.", "And when they persevered in the same course of life, God raised up\nwar against them from the king of Babylon and Chaldea, who sent an army\nagainst Judea, and laid waste the country; and caught king Manasseh by\ntreachery, and ordered him to be brought to him, and had him under his\npower to inflict what punishment he pleased upon him. But then it was that\nManasseh perceived what a miserable condition he was in, and esteeming\nhimself the cause of all, he besought God to render his enemy humane and\nmerciful to him. Accordingly, God heard his prayer, and granted him what\nhe prayed for. So Manasseh was released by the king of Babylon, and escaped\nthe danger he was in; and when he was come to Jerusalem, he endeavored,\nif it were possible, to cast out of his memory those his former sins against\nGod, of which he now repented, and to apply himself to a very religious\nlife. He sanctified the temple, and purged the city, and for the remainder\nof his days he was intent on nothing but to return his thanks to God for\nhis deliverance, and to preserve him propitious to him all his life long.\nHe also instructed the multitude to do the same, as having very nearly\nexperienced what a calamity he was fallen into by a contrary conduct. He\nalso rebuilt the altar, and offered the legal sacrifices, as Moses commanded.\nAnd when he had re-established what concerned the Divine worship, as it\nought to be, he took care of the security of Jerusalem: he did not only\nrepair the old walls with great diligence, but added another wall to the\nformer. He also built very lofty towers, and the garrisoned places before\nthe city he strengthened, not only in other respects, but with provisions\nof all sorts that they wanted. And indeed, when he had changed his former\ncourse, he so led his life for the time to come, that from the time of\nhis return to piety towards God he was deemed a happy man, and a pattern\nfor imitation. When therefore he had lived sixty-seven years, he departed\nthis life, having reigned fifty-five years, and was buried in his own garden;\nand the kingdom came to his son Amon, whose mother's name was Meshulemeth,\nof the city of Jotbath.", "THIS Amon imitated those works of his father which he insolently\ndid when he was young: so he had a conspiracy made against him by his own\nservants, and was slain in his own house, when he had lived twenty-four\nyears, and of them had reigned two. But the multitude punished those that\nslew Amon, and buried him with his father, and gave the kingdom to his\nson Josiah, who was eight years old. His mother was of the city of Boscath,\nand her name was Jedidah. He was of a most excellent disposition, and naturally\nvirtuous, and followed the actions of king David, as a pattern and a rule\nto him in the whole conduct of his life. And when he was twelve years old,\nhe gave demonstrations of his religious and righteous behavior; for he\nbrought the people to a sober way of living, and exhorted them to leave\noff the opinion they had of their idols, because they were not gods, but\nto worship their own God. And by repeating on the actions of his progenitors,\nhe prudently corrected what they did wrong, like a very elderly man, and\nlike one abundantly able to understand what was fit to be done; and what\nhe found they had well done, he observed all the country over, and imitated\nthe same. And thus he acted in following the wisdom and sagacity of his\nown nature, and in compliance with the advice and instruction of the elders;\nfor by following the laws it was that he succeeded so well in the order\nof his government, and in piety with regard to the Divine worship. And\nthis happened because the transgressions of the former kings were seen\nno more, but quite vanished away; for the king went about the city, and\nthe whole country, and cut down the groves which were devoted to strange\ngods, and overthrew their altars; and if there were any gifts dedicated\nto them by his forefathers, he made them ignominious, and plucked them\ndown; and by this means he brought the people back from their opinion about\nthem to the worship of God. He also offered his accustomed sacrifices and\nburnt-offerings upon the altar. Moreover, he ordained certain judges and\noverseers, that they might order the matters to them severally belonging,\nand have regard to justice above all things, and distribute it with the\nsame concern they would have about their own soul. He also sent over all\nthe country, and desired such as pleased to bring gold and silver for the\nrepairs of the temple, according to every one's inclinations and abilities.\nAnd when the money was brought in, he made one Maaseiah the governor of\nthe city, and Shaphan the scribe, and Joab the recorder, and Eliakim the\nhigh priest, curators of the temple, and of the charges contributed thereto;\nwho made no delay, nor put the work off at all, but prepared architects,\nand whatsoever was proper for those repairs, and set closely about the\nwork. So the temple was repaired by this means, and became a public demonstration\nof the king's piety.", "But when he was now in the eighteenth year of his reign, he sent\nto Eliakim the high priest, and gave order, that out of what money was\noverplus, he should cast cups, and dishes, and vials, for ministration\n[in the temple]; and besides, that they should bring all the gold or silver\nwhich was among the treasures, and expend that also in making cups and\nthe like vessels. But as the high priest was bringing out the gold, he\nlighted upon the holy books of Moses that were laid up in the temple; and\nwhen he had brought them out, he gave them to Shaphan the scribe, who,\nwhen he had read them, came to the king, and informed him that all was\nfinished which he had ordered to be done. He also read over the books to\nhim, who, when he had heard them read, rent his garment, and called for\nEliakim the high priest, and for [Shaphan] the scribe, and for certain\n[other] of his most particular friends, and sent them to Huldah the prophetess,\nthe wife of Shallum, (which Shallum was a man of dignity, and of an eminent\nfamily,) and bid them go to her, and say that [he desired] she would appease\nGod, and endeavor to render him propitious to them, for that there was\ncause to fear, lest, upon the transgression of the laws of Moses by their\nforefathers, they should be in peril of going into captivity, and of being\ncast out of their own country; lest they should be in want of all things,\nand so end their days miserably. When the prophetess had heard this from\nthe messengers that were sent to her by the king, she bid them go back\nto the king, and say that \"God had already given sentence against\nthem, to destroy the people, and cast them out of their country, and deprive\nthem of all the happiness they enjoyed; which sentence none could set aside\nby any prayers of theirs, since it was passed on account of their transgressions\nof the laws, and of their not having repented in so long a time, while\nthe prophets had exhorted them to amend, and had foretold the punishment\nthat would ensue on their impious practices; which threatening God would\ncertainly execute upon them, that they might be persuaded that he is God,\nand had not deceived them in any respect as to what he had denounced by\nhis prophets; that yet, because Josiah was a righteous man, he would at\npresent delay those calamities, but that after his death he would send\non the multitude what miseries he had determined for them.\"", "So these messengers, upon this prophecy of the woman, came and told\nit to the king; whereupon he sent to the people every where, and ordered\nthat the priests and the Levites should come together to Jerusalem; and\ncommanded that those of every age should be present also. And when they\nhad gathered together, he first read to them the holy books; after which\nhe stood upon a pulpit, in the midst of the multitude, and obliged them\nto make a covenant, with an oath, that they would worship God, and keep\nthe laws of Moses. Accordingly, they gave their assent willingly, and undertook\nto do what the king had recommended to them. So they immediately offered\nsacrifices, and that after an acceptable manner, and besought God to be\ngracious and merciful to them. He also enjoined the high priest, that if\nthere remained in the temple any vessel that was dedicated to idols, or\nto foreign gods, they should cast it out. So when a great number of such\nvessels were got together, he burnt them, and scattered their ashes abroad,\nand slew the priests of the idols that were not of the family of Aaron.", "And when he had done thus in Jerusalem, he came into the country,\nand utterly destroyed what buildings had been made therein by king Jeroboam,\nin honor of strange gods; and he burnt the bones of the false prophets\nupon that altar which Jeroboam first built; and, as the prophet [Jadon],\nwho came to Jeroboam when he was offering sacrifice, and when all the people\nheard him, foretold what would come to pass, viz. that a certain man of\nthe house of David, Josiah by name, should do what is here mentioned.

Now Neco sent a herald to Josiah, and told him that he did not\nmake this expedition against him, but was making haste to Euphrates; and\ndesired that he would not provoke him to fight against him, because he\nobstructed his march to the place whither he had resolved to go. But Josiah\ndid not admit of this advice of Neco, but put himself into a posture to\nhinder him from his intended march. I suppose it was fate that pushed him\non this conduct, that it might take an occasion against him; for as he\nwas setting his army in array, \nand rode about in his chariot, from one wing of his army to another, one\nof the Egyptians shot an arrow at him, and put an end to his eagerness\nof fighting; for being sorely wounded, he command a retreat to be sounded\nfor his army, and returned to Jerusalem, and died of that wound; and was\nmagnificently buried in the sepulcher of his fathers, when he had lived\nthirty-nine years, and of them had reigned thirty-one. But all the people\nmourned greatly for him, lamenting and grieving on his account many days;\nand Jeremiah the prophet composed an elegy to lament him, \nwhich is extant till tills time also.

However, as to what befell this prophet, we will\nrelate it in its proper place."}, "Upon the death of Josiah, which we have already mentioned, his son,\nJehoahaz by name, took the kingdom, being about twenty-three years old.\nHe reigned in Jerusalem; and his mother was Hamutal, of the city Libhah.\nHe was an impious man, and impure in his course of life; but as the king\nof Egypt returned from the battle, he sent for Jehoahaz to come to him,\nto the city called Hamath \nwhich belongs to Syria; and when he was come, he put him in bands, and\ndelivered the kingdom to a brother of his, by the father's side, whose\nname was Eliakim, and changed his name to Jehoiakim and laid a tribute\nupon the land of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold; and\nthis sum of money Jehoiakim paid by way of tribute; but Neco carried away\nJehoahaz into Egypt, where he died when he had reigned three months and\nten days. Now Jehoiakim's mother was called Zebudah, of the city Rumah.\nHe was of a wicked disposition, and ready to do mischief; nor was he either\nreligions towards God, or good-natured towards men.", "NOW in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, one whose name\nwas Nebuchadnezzar took the government over the Babylonians, who at the\nsame time went up with a great army to the city Carchemish, which was at\nEuphrates, upon a resolution he had taken to fight with Neco king of Egypt,\nunder whom all Syria then was. And when Neco understood the intention of\nthe king of Babylon, and that this expedition was made against him, he\ndid not despise his attempt, but made haste with a great band of men to\nEuphrates to defend himself from Nebuchadnezzar; and when they had joined\nbattle, he was beaten, and lost many ten thousands [of his soldiers] in\nthe battle. So the king of Babylon passed over Euphrates, and took all\nSyria, as far as Pelusium, excepting Judea. But when Nebuchadnezzar had\nalready reigned four years, which was the eighth of Jehoiakim's government\nover the Hebrews, the king of Babylon made an expedition with mighty forces\nagainst the Jews, and required tribute of Jehoiakim, and threatened upon\nhis refusal to make war against him. He was aftrighted at his threatening,\nand bought his peace with money, and brought the tribute he was ordered\nto bring for three years.", "But on the third year, upon hearing that the king of the Babylonians\nmade an expedition against the Egyptians, he did not pay his tribute; yet\nwas he disappointed of his hope, for the Egyptians durst not fight at this\ntime. And indeed the prophet Jeremiah foretold every day, how vainly they\nrelied on their hopes from Egypt, and how the city would be overthrown\nby the king of Babylon, and Jehoiakim the king would be subdued by him.\nBut what he thus spake proved to be of no advantage to them, because there\nwere none that should escape; for both the multitude and the rulers, when\nthey heard him, had no concern about what they heard; but being displeased\nat what was said, as if the prophet were a diviner against the king, they\naccused Jeremiah, and bringing him before the court, they required that\na sentence and a punishment might be given against him. Now all the rest\ngave their votes for his condemnation, but the elders refused, who prudently\nsent away the prophet from the court of [the prison], and persuaded the\nrest to do Jeremiah no harm; for they said that he was not the only person\nwho foretold what would come to the city, but that Micah signified the\nsame before him, as well as many others, none of which suffered any thing\nof the kings that then reigned, but were honored as the prophets of God.\nSo they mollified the multitude with these words, and delivered Jeremiah\nfrom the punishment to which he was condemned. Now when this prophet had\nwritten all his prophecies, and the people were fasting, and assembled\nat the temple, on the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim, he read\nthe book he had composed of his predictions of what was to befall the city,\nand the temple, and the multitude. And when the rulers heard of it, they\ntook the book from him, and bid him and Baruch the scribe to go their ways,\nlest they should be discovered by one or other; but they carried the book,\nand gave it to the king; so he gave order, in the presence of his friends,\nthat his scribe should take it, and read it. When the king heard what it\ncontained, he was angry, and tore it, and cast it into the fire, where\nit was consumed. He also commanded that they should seek for Jeremiah,\nand Baruch the scribe, and bring them to him, that they might be punished.\nHowever, they escaped his anger.", "Now, a little time afterwards, the king of Babylon made an expedition\nagainst Jehoiakim, whom he received [into the city], and this out of fear\nof the foregoing predictions of this prophet, as supposing he should suffer\nnothing that was terrible, because he neither shut the gates, nor fought\nagainst him; yet when he was come into the city, he did not observe the\ncovenants he had made, but he slew such as were in the flower of their\nage, and such as were of the greatest dignity, together with their king\nJehoiakim, whom he commanded to be thrown before the walls, without any\nburial; and made his son Jehoiachin king of the country, and of the city:\nhe also took the principal persons in dignity for captives, three thousand\nin number, and led them away to Babylon; among which was the prophet Ezekiel,\nwho was then but young. And this was the end of king Jehoiakim, when he\nhad lived thirty-six years, and of them reigned eleven.

And when\nthese were brought to him, he kept them in custody, and appointed Jehoiachin's\nuncle, Zedekiah, to be king; and made him take an oath, that he would certainly\nkeep the kingdom for him, and make no innovation, nor have any league of\nfriendship with the Egyptians.", "Now Zedekiah was twenty and one year's old when he took the government;\nand had the same mother with his brother Jehoiakim, but was a despiser\nof justice and of his duty, for truly those of the same age with him were\nwicked about him, and the whole multitude did what unjust and insolent\nthings they pleased; for which reason the prophet Jeremiah came often to\nhim, and protested to him, and insisted, that he must leave off his impieties\nand transgressions, and take care of what was right, and neither give ear\nto the rulers, (among whom were wicked men,) nor give credit to their false\nprophets, who deluded them, as if the king of Babylon would make no more\nwar against them, and as if the Egyptians would make war against him, and\nconquer him, since what they said was not true, and the events would not\nprove such [as they expected]. Now as to Zedekiah himself, while he heard\nthe prophet speak, he believed him, and agreed to every thing as true,\nand supposed it was for his advantage; but then his friends perverted him,\nand dissuaded him from what the prophet advised, and obliged him to do\nwhat they pleased. Ezekiel also foretold in Babylon what calamities were\ncoming upon the people, which when he heard, he sent accounts of them unto\nJerusalem. But Zedekiah did not believe their prophecies, for the reason\nfollowing: It happened that the two prophets agreed with one another in\nwhat they said as in all other things, that the city should be taken, and\nZedekiah himself should be taken captive; but Ezekiel disagreed with him,\nand said that Zedekiah should not see Babylon, while Jeremiah said to him,\nthat the king of Babylon should carry him away thither in bonds.

But Jeremiah came among\nthem, and prophesied what contradicted those predictions, and what proved\nto be true, that they did ill, and deluded the king; that the Egyptians\nwould be of no advantage to them, but that the king of Babylon would renew\nthe war against Jerusalem, and besiege it again, and would destroy the\npeople by famine, and carry away those that remained into captivity, and\nwould take away what they had as spoils, and would carry off those riches\nthat were in the temple; nay, that, besides this, he would burn it, and\nutterly overthrow the city, and that they should serve him and his posterity\nseventy years; that then the Persians and the Medes should put an end to\ntheir servitude, and overthrow the Babylonians; \"and that we shall\nbe dismissed, and return to this land, and rebuild the temple, and restore\nJerusalem.\" When Jeremiah said this, the greater part believed him;\nbut the rulers, and those that were wicked, despised him, as one disordered\nin his senses. Now he had resolved to go elsewhere, to his own country,\nwhich was called Anathoth, and was twenty furlongs distant from Jerusalem;\n\nand as he was going, one of the rulers met him, and seized upon him, and\naccused him falsely, as though he were going as a deserter to the Babylonians;\nbut Jeremiah said that he accused him falsely, and added, that he was only\ngoing to his own country; but the other would not believe him, but seized\nupon him, and led him away to the rulers, and laid an accusation against\nhim, under whom he endured all sorts of torments and tortures, and was\nreserved to be punished; and this was the condition he was in for some\ntime, while he suffered what I have already described unjustly."}, "Now in the ninth year of the reign of Zedekiah, on the tenth day\nof the tenth month, the king of Babylon made a second expedition against\nJerusalem, and lay before it eighteen months, and besieged it with the\nutmost application. There came upon them also two of the greatest calamities\nat the same time that Jerusalem was besieged, a famine and a pestilential\ndistemper, and made great havoc of them. And though the prophet Jeremiah\nwas in prison, he did not rest, but cried out, and proclaimed aloud, and\nexhorted the multitude to open their gates, and admit the king of Babylon,\nfor that if they did so, they should be preserved, and their whole families;\nbut if they did not so, they should be destroyed; and he foretold, that\nif any one staid in the city, he should certainly perish by one of these\nways, - either be consumed by the famine, or slain by the enemy's sword;\nbut that if he would flee to the enemy, he should escape death. Yet did\nnot these rulers who heard believe him, even when they were in the midst\nof their sore calamities; but they came to the king, and in their anger\ninformed him what Jeremiah had said, and accused him, and complained of\nthe prophet as of a madman, and one that disheartened their minds, and\nby the denunciation of miseries weakened the alacrity of the multitude,\nwho were otherwise ready to expose themselves to dangers for him, and for\ntheir country, while he, in a way of threatening, warned them to flee to\nthe enemy, and told them that the city should certainly be taken, and be\nutterly destroyed.", "But for the king himself, he was not at all irritated against Jeremiah,\nsuch was his gentle and righteous disposition; yet, that he might not be\nengaged in a quarrel with those rulers at such a time, by opposing what\nthey intended, he let them do with the prophet whatsoever they would; whereupon,\nwhen the king had granted them such a permission, they presently came into\nthe prison, and took him, and let him down with a cord into a pit full\nof mire, that he might be suffocated, and die of himself. So he stood up\nto the neck in the mire which was all about him, and so continued; but\nthere was one of the king's servants, who was in esteem with him, an Ethiopian\nby descent, who told the king what a state the prophet was in, and said\nthat his friends and his rulers had done evil in putting the prophet into\nthe mire, and by that means contriving against him that he should suffer\na death more bitter than that by his bonds only. When the king heard this,\nhe repented of his having delivered up the prophet to the rulers, and bid\nthe Ethiopian take thirty men of the king's guards, and cords with them,\nand whatsoever else they understood to be necessary for the prophet's preservation,\nand to draw him up immediately. So the Ethiopian took the men he was ordered\nto take, and drew up the prophet out of the mire, and left him at liberty\n[in the prison].", "But when the king had sent to call him privately, and inquired what\nhe could say to him from God, which might be suitable to his present circumstances,\nand desired him to inform him of it, Jeremiah replied, that he had somewhat\nto say; but he said withal, he should not be believed, nor, if he admonished\nthem, should be hearkened to; \"for,\" said he, \"thy friends\nhave determined to destroy me, as though I had been guilty of some wickedness;\nand where are now those men who deceived us, and said that the king of\nBabylon would not come and fight against us any more? but I am afraid now\nto speak the truth, lest thou shouldst condemn me to die.\" And when\nthe king had assured him upon oath, that he would neither himself put him\nto death, nor deliver him up to the rulers, he became bold upon that assurance\nthat was given him, and gave him this advice: That he should deliver the\ncity up to the Babylonians; and he said that it was God who prophesied\nthis by him, that [he must do so] if he would be preserved, and escape\nout of the danger he was in, and that then neither should the city fall\nto the ground, nor should the temple be burned; but that [if he disobeyed]\nhe would be the cause of these miseries coming upon the citizens, and of\nthe calamity that would befall his whole house. When the king heard this,\nhe said that he would willingly do what he persuaded him to, and what he\ndeclared would be to his advantage, but that he was afraid of those of\nhis own country that had fallen away to the Babylonians, lest he should\nbe accused by them to the king of Babylon, and be punished. But the prophet\nencouraged him, and said he had no cause to fear such punishment, for that\nhe should not have the experience of any misfortune, if he would deliver\nall up to the Babylonians, neither himself, nor his children, nor his wives,\nand that the temple should then continue unhurt. So when Jeremiah had said\nthis, the king let him go, and charged him to betray what they had resolved\non to none of the citizens, nor to tell any of these matters to any of\nthe rulers, if they should have learned that he had been sent for, and\nshould inquire of him what it was that he was sent for, and what he had\nsaid to him; but to pretend to them that he besought him that he might\nnot be kept in bonds and in prison. And indeed he said so to them; for\nthey came to the, prophet, and asked him what advice it was that he came\nto give the king relating to them. And thus I have finished what concerns\nthis matter.", "NOW the king of Babylon was very intent and earnest upon the siege\nof Jerusalem; and he erected towers upon great banks of earth, and from\nthem repelled those that stood upon the walls; he also made a great number\nof such banks round about the whole city, whose height was equal to those\nwalls. However, those that were within bore the siege with courage and\nalacrity, for they were not discouraged, either by the famine, or by the\npestilential distemper, but were of cheerful minds in the prosecution of\nthe war, although those miseries within oppressed them also, and they did\nnot suffer themselves to be terrified, either by the contrivances of the\nenemy, or by their engines of war, but contrived still different engines\nto oppose all the other withal, till indeed there seemed to be an entire\nstruggle between the Babylonians and the people of Jerusalem, which had\nthe greater sagacity and skill; the former party supposing they should\nbe thereby too hard for the other, for the destruction of the city; the\nlatter placing their hopes of deliverance in nothing else but in persevering\nin such inventions in opposition to the other, as might demonstrate the\nenemy's engines were useless to them.

The names of these generals\nwho ravaged and subdued Jerusalem, if any one desire to know them, were\nthese: Nergal Sharezer, Samgar Nebo, Rabsaris, Sorsechim, and Rabmag. And\nwhen the city was taken about midnight, and the enemy's generals were entered\ninto the temple, and when Zedekiah was sensible of it, he took his wives,\nand his children, and his captains, and his friends, and with them fled\nout of the city, through the fortified ditch, and through the desert; and\nwhen certain of the deserters had informed the Babylonians of this, at\nbreak of day, they made haste to pursue after Zedekiah, and overtook him\nnot far from Jericho, and encompassed him about. But for those friends\nand captains of Zedekiah who had fled out of the city with him, when they\nsaw their enemies near them, they left him, and dispersed themselves, some\none way, and some another, and every one resolved to save himself; so the\nenemy took Zedekiah alive, when he was deserted by all but a few, with\nhis children and his wives, and brought him to the king. When he was come,\nNebuchadnezzar began to call him a wicked wretch, and a covenant-breaker,\nand one that had forgotten his former words, when he promised to keep the\ncountry for him. He also reproached him for his ingratitude, that when\nhe had received the kingdom from him, who had taken it from Jehoiachin,\nand given it to him, he had made use of the power he gave him against him\nthat gave it; \"but,\" said he, \"God is great, who hated that\nconduct of thine, and hath brought thee under us.\" And when he had\nused these words to Zedekiah, he commanded his sons and his friends to\nbe slain, while Zedekiah and the rest of the captains looked on; after\nwhich he put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him, and carried him to\nBabylon. And these things happened to him, \nas Jeremiah and Ezekiel had foretold to him, that he should be caught,\nand brought before the king of Babylon, and should speak to him face to\nface, and should see his eyes with his own eyes; and thus far did Jeremiah\nprophesy.

It is also\nsufficient to show the ignorance and incredulity of men, whereby they are\nnot permitted to foresee any thing that is future, and are, without any\nguard, exposed to calamities, so that it is impossible for them to avoid\nthe experience of those calamities.", "And after this manner have the kings of David's race ended their\nlives, being in number twenty-one, until the last king, who all together\nreigned five hundred and fourteen years, and six months, and ten days;\nof whom Saul, who was their first king, retained the government twenty\nyears, though he was not of the same tribe with the rest.", "And now it was that the king of Babylon sent Nebuzaradan, the general\nof his army, to Jerusalem, to pillage the temple, who had it also in command\nto burn it and the royal palace, and to lay the city even with the ground,\nand to transplant the people into Babylon. Accordingly, he came to Jerusalem\nin the eleventh year of king Zedekiah, and pillaged the temple, and carried\nout the vessels of God, both gold and silver, and particularly that large\nlaver which Solomon dedicated, as also the pillars of brass, and their\nchapiters, with the golden tables and the candlesticks; and when he had\ncarried these off, he set fire to the temple in the fifth month, the first\nday of the month, in the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah, and in\nthe eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar: he also burnt the palace, and overthrew\nthe city. Now the temple was burnt four hundred and seventy years, six\nmonths, and ten days after it was built. It was then one thousand and sixty-two\nyears, six months, and ten days from the departure out of Egypt; and from\nthe deluge to the destruction of the temple, the whole interval was one\nthousand nine hundred and fifty-seven years, six months, and ten days;\nbut from the generation of Adam, until this befell the temple, there were\nthree thousand five hundred and thirteen years, six months, and ten days;\nso great was the number of years hereto belonging. And what actions were\ndone during these years we have particularly related. But the general of\nthe Babylonian king now overthrew the city to the very foundations, and\nremoved all the people, and took for prisoners the high priest Seraiah,\nand Zephaniah the priest that was next to him, and the rulers that guarded\nthe temple, who were three in number, and the eunuch who was over the armed\nmen, and seven friends of Zedekiah, and his scribe, and sixty other rulers;\nall which, together with the vessels which they had pillaged, he carried\nto the king of Babylon to Riblah, a city of Syria.

But the prophet had no mind to follow him, nor to dwell\nany where else, but would gladly live in the ruins of his country, and\nin the miserable remains of it. When the general understood what his purpose\nwas, he enjoined Gedaliah, whom he left behind, to take all possible care\nof him, and to supply him with whatsoever he wanted. So when he had given\nhim rich presents, he dismissed him. Accordingly, Jeremiah abode in a city\nof that country, which was called Mispah; and desired of Nebuzaradan that\nhe would set at liberty his disciple Baruch, the son of Neriah, one of\na very eminent family, and exceeding skillful in the language of his country.", "When Nebuzaradan had done thus, he made haste to Babylon. But as\nto those that fled away during the siege of Jerusalem, and had been scattered\nover the country, when they heard that the Babylonians were gone away,\nand had left a remnant in the land of Jerusalem, and those such as were\nto cultivate the same, they came together from all parts to Gedaliah to\nMispah. Now the rulers that were over them were Johanan, the son of Kareah,\nand Jezaniah, and Seraiah, and others beside them. Now there was of the\nroyal family one Ishmael, a wicked man, and very crafty, who, during the\nsiege of Jerusalem, fled to Baalis, the king of the Ammonites, and abode\nwith him during that time; and Gedaliah persuaded them, now they were there,\nto stay with him, and to have no fear of the Babylonians, for that if they\nwould cultivate the country, they should suffer no harm. This he assured\nthem of by oath; and said that they should have him for their patron, and\nthat if any disturbance should arise, they should find him ready to defend\nthem. He also advised them to dwell in any city, as every one of them pleased;\nand that they would send men along with his own servants, and rebuild their\nhouses upon the old foundations, and dwell there; and he admonished them\nbeforehand, that they should make preparation, while the season lasted,\nof corn, and wine, and oil, that they might have whereon to feed during\nthe winter. When he had thus discoursed to them, he dismissed them, that\nevery one might dwell in what place of the country he pleased.", "Now when this report was spread abroad as far as the nations that\nbordered on Judea, that Gedaliah kindly entertained those that came to\nhim, after they had fled away, upon this [only] condition, that they should\npay tribute to the king of Babylon, they also came readily to Gedaliah,\nand inhabited the country. And when Johanan, and the rulers that were with\nhim, observed the country, and the humanity of Gedaliah, they were exceedingly\nin love with him, and told him that Baalis, the king of the Ammonites,\nhad sent Ishmael to kill him by treachery, and secretly, that he might\nhave the dominion over the Israelites, as being of the royal family; and\nthey said that he might deliver himself from this treacherous design, if\nhe would give them leave to slay Ishmael, and nobody should know it, for\nthey told him they were afraid that, when he was killed by the other, the\nentire ruin of the remaining strength of the Israelites would ensue. But\nhe professed that he did not believe what they said, when they told him\nof such a treacherous design, in a man that had been well treated by him;\nbecause it was not probable that one who, under such a want of all things,\nhad failed of nothing that was necessary for him, should be found so wicked\nand ungrateful towards his benefactor, that when it would be an instance\nof wickedness in him not to save him, had he been treacherously assaulted\nby others, to endeavor, and that earnestly, to kill him with his own hands:\nthat, however, if he ought to suppose this information to be true, it was\nbetter for himself to be slain by the other, than to destroy a man who\nfled to him for refuge, and intrusted his own safety to him, and committed\nhimself to his disposal.", "So Johanan, and the rulers that were with him, not being able to\npersuade Gedaliah, went away. But after the interval of thirty days was\nover, Ishmael came again to Gedaliah, to the city Mispah, and ten men with\nhim; and when he had feasted Ishmael, and those that were with him, in\na splendid manner at his table, and had given them presents, he became\ndisordered in drink, while he endeavored to be very merry with them; and\nwhen Ishmael saw him in that case, and that he was drowned in his cups\nto the degree of insensibility, and fallen asleep, he rose up on a sudden,\nwith his ten friends, and slew Gedaliah, and those that were with him at\nthe feast; and when he had slain them, he went out by night, and slew all\nthe Jews that were in the city, and those soldiers also which were left\ntherein by the Babylonians. But the next day fourscore men came out of\nthe country with presents to Gedaliah, none of them knowing what had befallen\nhim; when Ishmael saw them, he invited them in to Gedaliah, and when they\nwere come in, he shut up the court, and slew them, and cast their dead\nbodies down into a certain deep pit, that they might not be seen; but of\nthese fourscore men Ishmael spared those that entreated him not to kill\nthem, till they had delivered up to him what riches they had concealed\nin the fields, consisting of their furniture, and garments, and corn: but\nhe took captive the people that were in Mispah, with their wives and children;\namong whom were the daughters of king Zedekiah, whom Nebuzaradan, the general\nof the army of Babylon, had left with Gedaliah. And when he had done this,\nhe came to the king of the Ammonites.", "But when Johanan and the rulers with him heard of what was done at\nMispah by Ishmael, and of the death of Gedaliah, they had indignation at\nit, and every one of them took his own armed men, and came suddenly to\nfight with Ishmael, and overtook him at the fountain in Hebron. And when\nthose that were carried away captives by Ishmael saw Johanan and the rulers,\nthey were very glad, and looked upon them as coming to their assistance;\nso they left him that had carried them captives, and came over to Johanan:\nthen Ishmael, with eight men, fled to the king of the Ammonites; but Johanan\ntook those whom he had rescued out of the hands of Ishmael, and the eunuchs,\nand their wives and children, and came to a certain place called Mandra,\nand there they abode that day, for they had determined to remove from thence\nand go into Egypt, out of fear, lest the Babylonians should slay them,\nin case they continued in the country, and that out of anger at the slaughter\nof Gedaliah, who had been by them set over it for governor.", "Now while they were under this deliberation, Johanan, the son of\nKareah, and the rulers. that were with him, came to Jeremiah the prophet,\nand desired that he would pray to God, that because they were at an utter\nloss about what they ought to do, he would discover it to them, and they\nsware that they would do whatsoever Jeremiah should say to them. And when\nthe prophet said he would be their intercessor with God, it came to pass,\nthat after ten days God appeared to him, and said that he should inform\nJohanan, and the other rulers, and all the people, that he would be with\nthem while they continued in that country, and take care of them, and keep\nthem from being hurt by the Babylonians, of whom they were afraid; but\nthat he would desert them if they went into Egypt, and, out of this wrath\nagainst them, would inflict the same punishments upon them which they knew\ntheir brethren had already endured. So when the prophet had informed Johanan\nand the people that God had foretold these things, he was not believed,\nwhen he said that God commanded them to continue in the country; but they\nimagined that he said so to gratify Baruch, his own disciple, and belied\nGod, and that he persuaded them to stay there, that they might be destroyed\nby the Babylonians.

Hereupon he threatened to put them to death,\nunless they told him his dream; and he gave command to have them all put\nto death, since they confessed they could not do what they were commanded\nto do. Now when Daniel heard that the king had given a command, that all\nthe wise men should be put to death, and that among them himself and his\nthree kinsmen were in danger, he went to Arioch, who was captain of the\nking's guards, and desired to know of him what was the reason why the king\nhad given command that all the wise men, and Chaldeans, and magicians should\nbe slain. So when he had learned that the king had had a dream, and had\nforgotten it, and that when they were enjoined to inform the king of it,\nthey had said they could not do it, and had thereby provoked him to anger,\nhe desired of Arioch that he would go in to the king, and desire respite\nfor the magicians for one night, and to put off their slaughter so long,\nfor that he hoped within that time to obtain, by prayer to God, the knowledge\nof the dream. Accordingly, Arioch informed the king of what Daniel desired.\nSo the king bid them delay the slaughter of the magicians till he knew\nwhat Daniel's promise would come to; but the young man retired to his own\nhouse, with his kinsmen, and besought God that whole night to discover\nthe dream, and thereby deliver the magicians and Chaldeans, with whom they\nwere themselves to perish, from the king's anger, by enabling him to declare\nhis vision, and to make manifest what the king had seen the night before\nin his sleep, but had forgotten it. Accordingly, God, out of pity to those\nthat were in danger, and out of regard to the wisdom of Daniel, made known\nto him the dream and its interpretation, that so the king might understand\nby him its signification also.

Accordingly, the king determined so to do. Now, after a little\nwhile, both himself and the city were taken by Cyrus, the king of Persia,\nwho fought against him; for it was Baltasar, under whom Babylon was taken,\nwhen he had reigned seventeen years. And this is the end of the posterity\nof king Nebuchadnezzar, as history informs us; but when Babylon was taken\nby Darius, and when he, with his kinsman Cyrus, had put an end to the dominion\nof the Babylonians, he was sixty-two years old. He was the son of Astyages,\nand had another name among the Greeks. Moreover, he took Daniel the prophet,\nand carried him with him into Media, and honored him very greatly, and\nkept him with him; for he was one of the three presidents whom he set over\nhis three hundred and sixty provinces, for into so many did Darius part\nthem.", "However, while Daniel was in so great dignity, and in so great favor\nwith Darius, and was alone intrusted with every thing by him, a having\nsomewhat divine in him, he was envied by the rest; for those that see others\nin greater honor than themselves with kings envy them; and when those that\nwere grieved at the great favor Daniel was in with Darius sought for an\noccasion against him, he afforded them no occasion at all, for he was above\nall the temptations of money, and despised bribery, and esteemed it a very\nbase thing to take any thing by way of reward, even when it might be justly\ngiven him; he afforded those that envied him not the least handle for an\naccusation. So when they could find nothing for which they might calumniate\nhim to the king, nothing that was shameful or reproachful, and thereby\ndeprive him of the honor he was in with him, they sought for some other\nmethod whereby they might destroy him. When therefore they saw that Daniel\nprayed to God three times a day, they thought they had gotten an occasion\nby which they might ruin him; so they came to Darius and told him that\nthe princes and governors had thought proper to allow the multitude a relaxation\nfor thirty days, that no one might offer a petition or prayer either to\nhimself or to the gods, but that he who shall transgress this decree shall\nbe cast into the den of lions, and there perish.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "It is no way improbable that Daniel's enemies might suggest this reason\nto the king why the lions did not meddle with him and that they might suspect\nthe king's kindness to Daniel had procured these lions to be so filled\nbeforehand, and that thence it was that he encouraged Daniel to submit\nto this experiment, in hopes of coming off safe; and that this was the\ntrue reason of making so terrible an experiment upon those his enemies,\nand all their families, Daniel 6:21, though our other copies do not directly\ntake notice of it"}, "#text": "Whereupon the king, not being acquainted with their wicked design,\nnor suspecting that it was a contrivance of theirs against Daniel, said\nhe was pleased with this decree of theirs, and he promised to confirm what\nthey desired; he also published an edict to promulgate to the people that\ndecree which the princes had made. Accordingly, all the rest took care\nnot to transgress those injunctions, and rested in quiet; but Daniel had\nno regard to them, but, as he was wont, he stood and prayed to God in the\nsight of them all; but the princes having met with the occasion they so\nearnestly sought to find against Daniel, came presently to the king, and\naccused him, that Daniel was the only person that transgressed the decree,\nwhile not one of the rest durst pray to their gods. This discovery they\nmade, not because of his impiety, but because they had watched him, and\nobserved him out of envy; for supposing that Darius did thus out of a greater\nkindness to him than they expected, and that he was ready to grant him\npardon for this contempt of his injunctions, and envying this very pardon\nto Daniel, they did not become more honorable to him, but desired he might\nbe cast into the den of lions according to the law. So Darius, hoping that\nGod would deliver him, and that he would undergo nothing that was terrible\nby the wild beasts, bid him bear this accident cheerfully. And when he\nwas cast into the den, he put his seal to the stone that lay upon the mouth\nof the den, and went his way, but he passed all the night without food\nand without sleep, being in great distress for Daniel; but when it was\nday, he got up, and came to the den, and found the seal entire, which he\nhad left the stone sealed withal; he also opened the seal, and. cried out,\nand called to Daniel, and asked him if he were alive. And as soon as he\nheard the king's voice, and said that he had suffered no harm, the king\ngave order that he should be drawn up out of the den.

But the king, out of an abhorrence of\ntheir wickedness, gave order that they should throw in a great deal of\nflesh to the lions; and when they had filled themselves, he gave further\norder that Daniel's enemies should be cast into the den, that he might\nlearn whether the lions, now they were full, would touch them or not. And\nit appeared plain to Darius, after the princes had been cast to the wild\nbeasts, that it was God who preserved \nfor the lions spared none of them, but tore them all to pieces, as if they\nhad been very hungry, and wanted food. I suppose therefore it was not their\nhunger, which had been a little before satisfied with abundance of flesh,\nbut the wickedness of these men, that provoked them [to destroy the princes];\nfor if it so please God, that wickedness might, by even those irrational\ncreatures, be esteemed a plain foundation for their punishment."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "What Josephus here says, that the stones of the sepulchers of the kings\nof Persia at this tower, or those perhaps of the same sort that are now\ncommonly called the ruins of Persepolis, continued so entire and unaltered\nin his days, as if they were lately put there, \"I (says Reland) here\ncan show to be true, as to those stones of the Persian mansoleum, which\nCom.

He had also Daniel in very\ngreat esteem, and made him the principal of his friends. Now when Daniel\nwas become so illustrious and famous, on account of the opinion men had\nthat he was beloved of God, he built a tower at Ecbatana, in Media: it\nwas a most elegant building, and wonderfully made, and it is still remaining,\nand preserved to this day; and to such as see it, it appears to have been\nlately built, and to have been no older than that very day when any one\nlooks upon it, it is so fresh \nflourishing, and beautiful, and no way grown old in so long time; for buildings\nsuffer the same as men do, they grow old as well as they, and by numbers\nof years their strength is dissolved, and their beauty withered. Now they\nbury the kings of Media, of Persia, and Parthia in this tower to this day,\nand he who was entrusted with the care of it was a Jewish priest; which\nthing is also observed to this day. But it is fit to give an account of\nwhat this man did, which is most admirable to hear, for he was so happy\nas to have strange revelations made to him, and those as to one of the\ngreatest of the prophets, insomuch, that while he was alive he had the\nesteem and applause both of the kings and of the multitude; and now he\nis dead, he retains a remembrance that will never fail, for the several\nbooks that he wrote and left behind him are still read by us till this\ntime; and from them we believe that Daniel conversed with God; for he did\nnot only prophesy of future events, as did the other prophets, but he also\ndetermined the time of their accomplishment. And while prophets used to\nforetell misfortunes, and on that account were disagreeable both to the\nkings and to the multitude, Daniel was to them a prophet of good things,\nand this to such a degree, that by the agreeable nature of his predictions,\nhe procured the goodwill of all men; and by the accomplishment of them,\nhe procured the belief of their truth, and the opinion of [a sort of] divinity\nfor himself, among the multitude. He also wrote and left behind him what\nmade manifest the accuracy and undeniable veracity of his predictions;\nfor he saith, that when he was in Susa, the metropolis of Persia, and went\nout into the field with his companions, there was, on the sudden, a motion\nand concussion of the earth, and that he was left alone by himself, his\nfriends fleeing away from him, and that he was disturbed, and fell on his\nface, and on his two hands, and that a certain person touched him, and,\nat the same time, bid him rise, and see what would befall his countrymen\nafter many generations. He also related, that when he stood up, he was\nshown a great rain, with many horns growing out of his head, and that the\nlast was higher than the rest: that after this he looked to the west, and\nsaw a he-goat carried through the air from that quarter; that he rushed\nupon the ram with violence, and smote him twice with his horns, and overthrew\nhim to the ground, and trampled upon him: that afterward he saw a very\ngreat horn growing out of the head of the he-goat, and that when it was\nbroken off, four horns grew up that were exposed to each of the four winds,\nand he wrote that out of them arose another lesser horn, which, as he said,\nwaxed great; and that God showed to him that it should fight against his\nnation, and take their city by force, and bring the temple worship to confusion,\nand forbid the sacrifices to be offered for one thousand two hundred and\nninety-six days. Daniel wrote that he saw these visions in the Plain of\nSusa; and he hath informed us that God interpreted the appearance of this\nvision after the following manner: He said that the ram signified the kingdoms\nof the Medes and Persians, and the horns those kings that were to reign\nin them; and that the last horn signified the last king, and that he should\nexceed all the kings in riches and glory: that the he-goat signified that\none should come and reign from the Greeks, who should twice fight with\nthe Persian, and overcome him in battle, and should receive his entire\ndominion: that by the great horn which sprang out of the forehead of the\nhe-goat was meant the first king; and that the springing up of four horns\nupon its falling off, and the conversion of every one of them to the four\nquarters of the earth, signified the successors that should arise after\nthe death of the first king, and the partition of the kingdom among them,\nand that they should be neither his children, nor of his kindred, that\nshould reign over the habitable earth for many years; and that from among\nthem there should arise a certain king that should overcome our nation\nand their laws, and should take away their political government, and should\nspoil the temple, and forbid the sacrifices to be offered for three years'\ntime. And indeed it so came to pass, that our nation suffered these things\nunder Antiochus Epiphanes, according to Daniel's vision, and what he wrote\nmany years before they came to pass. In the very same manner Daniel also\nwrote concerning the Roman government, and that our country should be made\ndesolate by them. All these things did this man leave in writing, as God\nhad showed them to him, insomuch that such as read his prophecies, and\nsee how they have been fulfilled, would wonder at the honor wherewith God\nhonored Daniel; and may thence discover how the Epicureans are in an error,\nwho cast Providence out of human life, and do not believe that God takes\ncare of the affairs of the world, nor that the universe is governed and\ncontinued in being by that blessed and immortal nature, but say that the\nworld is carried along of its own accord, without a ruler and a curator;\nwhich, were it destitute of a guide to conduct it, as they imagine, it\nwould be like ships without pilots, which we see drowned by the winds,\nor like chariots without drivers, which are overturned; so would the world\nbe dashed to pieces by its being carried without a Providence, and so perish,\nand come to nought. So that, by the forementioned predictions of Daniel,\nthose men seem to me very much to err from the truth, who determine that\nGod exercises no providence over human affairs; for if that were the case,\nthat the world went on by mechanical necessity, we should not see that\nall things would come to pass according to his prophecy. Now as to myself,\nI have so described these matters as I have found them and read them; but\nif any one is inclined to another opinion about them, let him enjoy his\ndifferent sentiments without any blame from me."}]}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "11", "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "title", "@place": "inline", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Book XI"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "title", "@place": "inline", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "CONTAINING THE INTERVAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY-THREE YEARS\nAND FIVE MONTHS.\nFROM THE FIRST OF CYRUS TO THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER THE\nGREAT."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "sum", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "HOW CYRUS, KING OF THE PERSIANS, DELIVERED THE JEWS OUT OF\nBABYLON AND SUFFERED THEM TO RETURN TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND TO BUILD THEIR\nTEMPLE, FOR WHICH WORK HE GAVE THEM MONEY."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "sum", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "HOW UPON THE DEATH OF CYRUS THE JEWS WERE HINDERED IN BUILDING\nOF THE TEMPLE BY THE CUTHEANS, AND THE NEIGHBORING GOVERNORS;

He was also, with\ntwo others, thought worthy to be guard of the king's body; and obtained\nthat honor which he hoped for.", "Now, in the first year of the king's reign, Darius feasted those\nthat were about him, and those born in his house, with the rulers of the\nMedes, and princes of the Persians, and the toparchs of India and Ethiopia,\nand the generals of the armies of his hundred and twenty-seven provinces.\nBut when they had eaten and drunk to satiety, and abundantly, they every\none departed to go to bed at their own houses, and Darius the king went\nto bed; but after he had rested a little part of the night, he awaked,\nand not being able to sleep any more, he fell into conversation with the\nthree guards of his body, and promised, that to him who should make an\noration about points that he should inquire of, such as should be most\nagreeable to truth, and to the dictates of wisdom, he would grant it as\na reward of his victory, to put on a purple garment, and to drink in cups\nof gold, and to sleep upon gold, and to have a chariot with bridles of\ngold, and a head tire of fine linen, and a chain of gold about his neck,\nand to sit next to himself, on account of his wisdom; \"and,\"\nsays he, \"he shall be called my cousin.\" Now when he had promised\nto give them these gifts, he asked the first of them, \"Whether wine\nwas not the strongest?\"--the second, \"Whether kings were not\nsuch?\"  and the third, \"Whether women were not such? or whether truth\nwas not the strongest of all?\" When he had proposed that they should\nmake their inquiries about these problems, he went to rest; but in the\nmorning he sent for his great men, his princes, and toparchs of Persia\nand Media, and set himself down in the place where he used to give audience,\nand bid each of the guards of his body to declare what they thought proper\nconcerning the proposed questions, in the hearing of them all.", "Accordingly, the first of them began to speak of the strength of\nwine, and demonstrated it thus: \"When,\" said he,\" I am to\ngive my opinion of wine, O you men, I find that it exceeds every thing,\nby the following indications: It deceives the mind of those that drink\nit, and reduces that of the king to the same state with that of the orphan,\nand he who stands in need of a tutor; and erects that of the slave to the\nboldness of him that is free; and that of the needy becomes like that of\nthe rich man, for it changes and renews the souls of men when it gets into\nthem; and it quenches the sorrow of those that are under calamities, and\nmakes men forget the debts they owe to others, and makes them think themselves\nto be of all men the richest; it makes them talk of no small things, but\nof talents, and such other names as become wealthy men only; nay more,\nit makes them insensible of their commanders, and of their kings, and takes\naway the remembrance of their friends and companions, for it arms men even\nagainst those that are dearest to them, and makes them appear the greatest\nstrangers to them; and when they are become sober, and they have slept\nout their wine in the night, they arise without knowing any thing they\nhave done in their cups. I take these for signs of power, and by them discover\nthat wine is the strongest and most insuperable of all things.\"", "As soon as the first had given the forementioned demonstrations of\nthe strength of wine, he left off; and the next to him began to speak about\nthe strength of a king, and demonstrated that it was the strongest of all,\nand more powerful than any thing else that appears to have any force or\nwisdom. He began his demonstration after the following manner; and said,\"\nThey are men who govern all things; they force the earth and the sea to\nbecome profitable to them in what they desire, and over these men do kings\nrule, and over them they have authority. Now those who rule over that animal\nwhich is of all the strongest and most powerful, must needs deserve to\nbe esteemed insuperable in power and force. For example, when these kings\ncommand their subjects to make wars, and undergo dangers, they are hearkened\nto; and when they send them against their enemies, their power is so great\nthat they are obeyed. They command men to level mountains, and to pull\ndown walls and towers; nay, when they are commanded to be killed and to\nkill, they submit to it, that they may not appear to transgress the king's\ncommands; and when they have conquered, they bring what they have gained\nin the war to the king. Those also who are not soldiers, but cultivate\nthe ground, and plough it, and when, after they have endured the labor\nand all the inconveniences of such works of husbandry, they have reaped\nand gathered in their fruits, they bring tributes to the king; and whatsoever\nit is which the king says or commands, it is done of necessity, and that\nwithout any delay, while he in the mean time is satiated with all sorts\nof food and pleasures, and sleeps in quiet. He is guarded by such as watch,\nand such as are, as it were, fixed down to the place through fear; for\nno one dares leave him, even when he is asleep, nor does any one go away\nand take care of his own affairs; but he esteems this one thing the only\nwork of necessity, to guard the king, and accordingly to this he wholly\naddicts himself. How then can it be otherwise, but that it must appear\nthat the king exceeds all in strength, while so great a multitude obeys\nhis injunctions?\"", "Now when this man had held his peace, the third of them, who was\nZorobabel, began to instruct them about women, and about truth, who said\nthus: \"Wine is strong, as is the king also, whom all men obey, but\nwomen are superior to them in power; for it was a woman that brought the\nking into the world; and for those that plant the vines and make the wine,\nthey are women who bear them, and bring them up: nor indeed is there any\nthing which we do not receive from them; for these women weave garments\nfor us, and our household affairs are by their means taken care of, and\npreserved in safety; nor can we live separate from women. And when we have\ngotten a great deal of gold and silver, and any other thing that is of\ngreat value, and deserving regard, and see a beautiful woman, we leave\nall these things, and with open mouth fix our eyes upon her countenance,\nand are willing to forsake what we have, that we may enjoy her beauty,\nand procure it to ourselves. We also leave father, and mother, and the\nearth that nourishes us, and frequently forget our dearest friends, for\nthe sake of women; nay, we are so hardy as to lay down our lives for them.\nBut what will chiefly make you take notice of the strength of women is\nthis that follows: Do not we take pains, and endure a great deal of trouble,\nand that both by land and sea, and when we have procured somewhat as the\nfruit of our labors, do not we bring them to the women, as to our mistresses,\nand bestow them upon them? Nay, I once saw the king, who is lord of so\nmany people, smitten on the face by Apame, the daughter of Rabsases Themasius,\nhis concubine, and his diadem taken away from him, and put upon her own\nhead, while he bore it patiently; and when she smiled he smiled, and when\nshe was angry he was sad; and according to the change of her passions,\nhe flattered his wife, and drew her to reconciliation by the great humiliation\nof himself to her, if at my time he saw her displeased at him.\"", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The reader is to note, that although the speeches or papers of these three\nof the king's guard are much the same, in our Third Book of Esdras, ch.\n3. and 4., as they are here in Josephus, yet that the introduction of them\nis entirely different, while in our Esdras the whole is related as the\ncontrivance of the three of the king's guards themselves; and even the\nmighty rewards are spoken of as proposed by themselves, and the speeches\nare related to have been delivered by themselves to the king in writing,\nwhile all is contrary in Josephus. I need not say whose account is the\nmost probable, the matters speak for themselves; and there can be no doubt\nbut Josephus's history is here to be very much preferred before the other.\nNor indeed does it seem to me at all unlikely that the whole was a contrivance\nof king Darius's own, in order to be decently and inoffensively put in\nmind by Zorobabel of fulfilling his old vow for the rebuilding of Jerusalem\nand the temple, and the restoration of the worship of the \"one true\nGod\" there. Nor does the full meaning of Zorobabel, when he cries\nout, 3 Esd. 4. 41), \"Blessed be the God of truth ;\" and here,\n\"God is true and righteous;\" or even of all the people, 3 Esd.\n4. 41, \"Great is truth, and mighty above all things ;\" seem to\nme much different from this, \"There is but one true God, the God of\nIsrael.\" To which doctrine, such as Cyrus and Darius; etc., the Jews'\ngreat patrons, seem not to have been very averse, though the entire idolatry\nof their kingdoms made them generally conceal it."}, "#text": "And when the princes and rulers looked one upon another, he began\nto speak about truth; and he said, \"I have already demonstrated how\npowerful women are; but both these women themselves, and the king himself,\nare weaker than truth; for although the earth be large, and the heaven\nhigh, and the course of the sun swift, yet are all these moved according\nto the will of God, who is true and righteous, for which cause we also\nought to esteem truth to be the strongest of all things, and that what\nis unrighteous is of no force against it. Moreover, all things else that\nhave any strength are mortal and short-lived, but truth is a thing that\nis immortal and eternal. It affords us not indeed such a beauty as will\nwither away by time, nor such riches as may be taken away by fortune, but\nrighteous rules and laws. It distinguishes them from injustice, and puts\nwhat is unrighteous to rebuke.\""}, "So when Zorobabel had left off his discourse about truth, and the\nmultitude had cried out aloud that he had spoken the most wisely, and that\nit was truth alone that had immutable strength, and such as never would\nwax old, the king commanded that he should ask for somewhat over and above\nwhat he had promised, for that he would give it him because of his wisdom,\nand that prudence wherein he exceeded the rest; \"and thou shalt sit\nwith me,\" said the king, \"and shalt be called my cousin.\"\nWhen he had said this, Zorobabel put him in mind of the vow he had made\nin case he should ever have the kingdom. Now this vow was, \"to rebuild\nJerusalem, and to build therein the temple of God; as also to restore the\nvessels which Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged, and carried to Babylon. And\nthis,\" said he, \"is that request which thou now permittest me\nto make, on account that I have been judged to be wise and understanding.\"", "So the king was pleased with what he had said, and arose and kissed\nhim; and wrote to the toparchs and governors, and enjoined them to conduct\nZorobabel and those that were going with him to build the temple. He also\nsent letters to those rulers that were in Syria and Phoenicia to cut down\nand carry cedar trees from Lebanon to Jerusalem, and to assist him in building\nthe city. He also wrote to them, that all the captives who should go to\nJudea should be free; and he prohibited his deputies and governors to lay\nany king's taxes upon the Jews; he also permitted that they should have\nall that land which they could possess themselves of without tributes.\nHe also enjoined the Idumeans and Samaritans, and the inhabitants of Celesyria,\nto restore those villages which they had taken from the Jews; and that,\nbesides all this, fifty talents should be given them for the building of\nthe temple. He also permitted them to offer their appointed sacrifices,\nand that whatsoever the high priest and the priests wanted, and those sacred\ngarments wherein they used to worship God, should be made at his own charges;\n.and that the musical instruments which the Levites used in singing hymns\nto God should be given them. Moreover, he charged them, that portions of\nland should be given to those that guarded the city and the temple, as\nalso a determinate sum of money every year for their maintenance; and withal\nhe sent the vessels. And all that Cyrus intended to do before him relating\nto the restoration of Jerusalem, Darius also ordained should be done accordingly.", "Now when Zorobabel had obtained these grants from the king, he went\nout of the palace, and looking up to heaven, he began to return thanks\nto God for the wisdom he had given him, and the victory he had gained thereby,\neven in the presence of Darius himself; for, said he, \"I had not been\nthought worthy of these advantages, O Lord, unless thou hadst been favorable\nto me.\" When therefore he had returned these thanks to God for the\npresent circumstances he was in, and had prayed to him to afford him the\nlike favor for the time to come, he came to Babylon, and brought the good\nnews to his countrymen of what grants he had procured for them from the\nking; who, when they heard the same, gave thanks also to God that he restored\nthe land of their forefathers to them again. So they betook themselves\nto drinking and eating, and for seven days they continued feasting, and\nkept a festival, for the rebuilding and restoration of their country: after\nthis they chose themselves rulers, who should go up to Jerusalem, out of\nthe tribes of their forefathers, with their wives, and children, and cattle,\nwho traveled to Jerusalem with joy and pleasure, under the conduct of those\nwhom Darius sent along with them, and making a noise with songs, and pipes,\nand cymbals. The rest of the Jewish multitude also besides accompanied\nthem with rejoicing.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This strange reading in Josephus's present copies of four millions instead\nof forty thousand, is one of the grossest errors that is in them, and ought\nto be corrected from Ezra 2:61; 1 Esd. 5:40; and Nehemiah 7:66, who all\nagree the general sum was but about forty-two thousand three hundred and\nsixty. It is also very plain that Josephus thought, that when Esdras afterwards\nbrought up another company out of Babylon and Persia, in the days of Xerxes,\nthey were also, as well as these, out of the two tribes, and out of them\nonly, and were in all no more than \"a seed\" and \"a remnant,\"\nwhile an \"immense number\" of the ten tribes never returned, but,\nas he believed, continued then beyond Euphrates, ch. 5. sect. 2, 3; of\nwhich multitude, the Jews beyond Euphrates, he speaks frequently elsewhere,\nthough, by the way, he never takes them to be idolaters, but looks on them\nstill as observers of the laws of Moses.

He then built the\naltar on the same place it had formerly been built, that they might offer\nthe appointed sacrifices upon it to God, according to the laws of Moses.\nBut while they did this, they did not please the neighboring nations, who\nall of them bare an ill-will to them. They also celebrated the feast of\ntabernacles at that time, as the legislator had ordained concerning it;\nand after they offered sacrifices, and what were called the daily sacrifices,\nand the oblations proper for the Sabbaths, and for all the holy festivals.\nThose also that had made vows performed them, and offered their sacrifices\nfrom the first day of the seventh month. They also began to build the temple,\nand gave a great deal of money to the masons and to the carpenters, and\nwhat was necessary for the maintenance of the workmen. The Sidonians also\nwere very willing and ready to bring the cedar trees from Libanus, to bind\nthem together, and to make a united float of them, and to bring them to\nthe port of Joppa, for that was what Cyrus had commanded at first, and\nwhat was now done at the command of Darius.", "In the second year of their coming to Jerusalem, as the Jews were\nthere in the second month, the building of the temple went on apace; and\nwhen they had laid its foundations on the first day of the second month\nof that second year, they set, as overseers of the work, such Levites as\nwere full twenty years old; and Jeshua and his sons and brethren, and Codmiel\nthe brother of Judas, the son of Aminadab, with his sons; and the temple,\nby the great diligence of those that had the care of it, was finished sooner\nthan any one would have expected. And when the temple was finished, the\npriests, adorned with their accustomed garments, stood with their trumpets,\nwhile the Levites, and the sons of Asaph, stood and sung hymns to God,\naccording as David first of all appointed them to bless God. Now the priests\nand Levites, and the elder part of the families, recollecting with themselves\nhow much greater and more sumptuous the old temple had been, seeing that\nnow made how much inferior it was, on account of their poverty, to that\nwhich had been built of old, considered with themselves how much their\nhappy state was sunk below what it had been of old, as well as their temple.\nHereupon they were disconsolate, and not able to contain their grief, and\nproceeded so far as to lament and shed tears on those accounts; but the\npeople in general were contented with their present condition; and because\nthey were allowed to build them a temple, they desired no more, and neither\nregarded nor remembered, nor indeed at all tormented themselves with the\ncomparison of that and the former temple, as if this were below their expectations;\nbut the wailing of the old men and of the priests, on account of the deficiency\nof this temple, in their opinion, if compared with that which had been\ndemolished, overcame the sounds of the trumpets and the rejoicing of the\npeople.", "But when the Samaritans, who were still enemies to the tribes of\nJudah and Benjamin, heard the sound of the trumpets, they came running\ntogether, and desired to know what was the occasion of this tumult; and\nwhen they perceived that it was from the Jews, who had been carried captive\nto Babylon, and were rebuilding their temple, they came to Zorobabel and\nto Jeshua, and to the heads of the families, and desired that they would\ngive them leave to build the temple with them, and to be partners with\nthem in building it; for they said, \"We worship their God, and especially\npray to him, and are desirous of their religious settlement, and this ever\nsince Shalmanezer, the king of Assyria, transplanted us out of Cuthah and\nMedia to this place.\" When they said thus, Zorobabel and Jeshua the\nhigh priest, and the heads of the families of the Israelites, replied to\nthem, that it was impossible for them to permit them to be their partners,\nwhilst they [only] had been appointed to build that temple at first by\nCyrus, and now by Darius, although it was indeed lawful for them to come\nand worship there if they pleased, and that they could allow them nothing\nbut that in common with them, which was common to them with all other men,\nto come to their temple and worship God there.", "When the Cuthearts heard this, for the Samaritans have that appellation,\nthey had indignation at it, and persuaded the nations of Syria to desire\nof the governors, in the same manner as they had done formerly in the days\nof Cyrus, and again in the days of Cambyses afterwards, to put a stop to\nthe building of the temple, and to endeavor to delay and protract the Jews\nin their zeal about it. Now at this time Sisinnes, the governor of Syria\nand Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, with certain others, came up to Jerusalem,\nand asked the rulers of the Jews, by. whose grant it was that they built\nthe temple in this manner, since it was more like to a citadel than a temple?\nand for what reason it was that they built cloisters and walls, and those\nstrong ones too, about the city? To which Zorobabel and Jeshua the high\npriest replied, that they were the servants of God Almighty; that this\ntemple was built for him by a king of theirs, that lived in great prosperity,\nand one that exceeded all men in virtue; and that it continued a long time,\nbut that because of their fathers' impiety towards God, Nebuchadnezzar,\nking of the Babylonians and of the Chaldeans, took their city by force,\nand destroyed it, and pillaged the temple, and burnt it down, and transplanted\nthe people whom he had made captives, and removed them to Babylon; that\nCyrus, who, after him, was king of Babylonia and Persia, wrote to them\nto build the temple, and committed the gifts and vessels, and whatsoever\nNebuchadnezzar had carried out of it, to Zorobabel, and Mithridates the\ntreasurer; and gave order to have them carried to Jerusalem, and to have\nthem restored to their own temple, when it was built; for he had sent to\nthem to have that done speedily, and commanded Sanabassar to go up to Jerusalem,\nand to take care of the building of the temple; who, upon receiving that\nepistle from Cyrus, came, and immediately laid its foundations; \"and although\nit hath been in building from that time to this, it hath not yet been finished,\nby reason of the malignity of our enemies. If therefore you have a mind,\nand think it proper, write this account to Darius, that when he hath consulted\nthe records of the kings, he may find that we have told you nothing that\nis false about this matter.\"", "When Zorobabel and the high priest had made this answer, Sisinnes,\nand those that were with him, did not resolve to hinder the building, until\nthey had informed king Darius of all this. So they immediately wrote to\nhim about these affairs; but as the Jews were now under terror, and afraid\nlest the king should change his resolutions as to the building of Jerusalem\nand of the temple, there were two prophets at that time among them, Haggai\nand Zechariah, who encouraged them, and bid them be of good cheer, and\nto suspect no discouragement from the Persians, for that God foretold this\nto them. So, in dependence on those prophets, they applied themselves earnestly\nto building, and did not intermit one day.", "Now Darius, when the Samaritans had written to him, and in their\nepistle had accused the Jews, how they fortified the city, and built the\ntemple more like to a citadel than to a temple; and said, that their doings\nwere not expedient for the king's affairs; and besides, they showed the\nepistle of Cambyses, wherein he forbade them to build the temple: and when\nDarius thereby understood that the restoration of Jerusalem was not expedient\nfor his affairs, and when he had read the epistle that was brought him\nfrom Sisinnes, and those that were with him, he gave order that what concerned\nthese matters should be sought for among the royal records. Whereupon a\nbook was found at Ecbatana, in the tower that was in Media, wherein was\nwritten as follows: \"Cyrus the king, in the first year of his reign,\ncommanded that the temple should be built in Jerusalem; and the altar in\nheight threescore cubits, and its breadth of the same, with three edifices\nof polished stone, and one edifice of stone of their own country; and he\nordained that the expenses of it should be paid out of the king's revenue.\nHe also commanded that the vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged [out\nof the temple], and had carried to Babylon, should be restored to the people\nof Jerusalem; and that the care of these things should belong to Sanabassar,\nthe governor and president of Syria and Phoenicia, and his associates,\nthat they may not meddle with that place, but may permit the servants of\nGod, the Jews and their rulers, to build the temple. He also ordained that\nthey should assist them in the work; and that they should pay to the Jews,\nout of the tribute of the country where they were governors, on account\nof the sacrifices, bulls, and rams, and lambs, and kids of the goats, and\nfine flour, and oil, and wine, and all other things that the priests should\nsuggest to them; and that they should pray for the preservation of the\nking, and of the Persians; and that for such as transgressed any of these\norders thus sent to them, he commanded that they should be caught, and\nhung upon a cross, and their substance confiscated to the king's use. He\nalso prayed to God against them, that if any one attempted to hinder the\nbuilding of the temple, God would strike him dead, and thereby restrain\nhis wickedness.\"", "When Darius had found this book among the records of Cyrus, he wrote\nan answer to Sisinnes and his associates, whose contents were these: \"King\nDarius to Sisinnes the governor, and to Sathrabuzanes, sendeth greeting.\nHaving found a copy of this epistle among the records of Cyrus, I have\nsent it you; and I will that all things be done as is therein written.\nFare ye well.\" So when Sisinnes, and those that were with him, understood\nthe intention of the king, they resolved to follow his directions entirely\nfor the time to come. So they forwarded the sacred works, and assisted\nthe elders of the Jews, and the princes of the Sanhedrim; and the structure\nof the temple was with great diligence brought to a conclusion, by the\nprophecies of Haggai and Zechariah, according to God's commands, and by\nthe injunctions of Cyrus and Darius the kings. Now the temple was built\nin seven years' time. And in the ninth year of the reign of Darius, on\nthe twenty-third day of the twelfth month, which is by us called Adar,\nbut by the Macedonians Dystrus, the priests, and Levites, and the other\nmultitude of the Israelites, offered sacrifices, as the renovation of their\nformer prosperity after their captivity, and because they had now the temple\nrebuilt, a hundred bulls, two hundred rains, four hundred lambs, and twelve\nkids of the goats, according to the number of their tribes, (for so many\nare the tribes of the Israelites,) and this last for the sins of every\ntribe. The priests also and the Levites set the porters at every gate,\naccording to the laws of Moses. The Jews also built the cloisters of the\ninner temple that were round about the temple itself.", "And as the feast of unleavened bread was at hand, in the first month,\nwhich, according to the Macedonians, is called Xanthicus, but according\nto us Nisan, all the people ran together out of the villages to the city,\nand celebrated the festival, having purified themselves, with their wives\nand children, according to the law of their country; and they offered the\nsacrifice which was called the Passover, on the fourteenth day of the same\nmonth, and feasted seven days, and spared for no cost, but offered whole\nburnt-offerings to God, and performed sacrifices of thanksgiving, because\nGod had led them again to the land of their fathers, and to the laws thereto\nbelonging, and had rendered the mind of the king of Persia favorable to\nthem. So these men offered the largest sacrifices on these accounts, and\nused great magnificence in the worship of God, and dwelt in Jerusalem,\nand made use of a form of government that was aristocratical, but mixed\nwith an oligarchy, for the high priests were at the head of their affairs,\nuntil the posterity of the Asamoneans set up kingly government; for before\ntheir captivity, and the dissolution of their polity, they at first had\nkingly government from Saul and David for five hundred and thirty-two years,\nsix months, and ten days; but before those kings, such rulers governed\nthem as were called judges and monarchs. Under this form of government\nthey continued for more than five hundred years after the death of Moses,\nand of Joshua their commander. And this is the account I had to give of\nthe Jews who had been carried into captivity, but were delivered from it\nin the times of Cyrus and Darius.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The history contained in this section is entirely wanting in all our other\ncopies, both of Ezra and Esdras."}, "#text": "But the Samaritans, being evil and enviously disposed to the Jews, wrought\nthem many mischiefs, by reliance on their riches, and by their pretense\nthat they were allied to the Persians, on account that thence they came;\nand whatsoever it was that they were enjoined to pay the Jews by the king's\norder out of their tributes for the sacrifices, they would not pay it.\nThey had also the governors favorable to them, and assisting them for that\npurpose; nor did they spare to hurt them, either by themselves or by others,\nas far as they were able. So the Jews determined to send an embassage to\nking Darius, in favor of the people of Jerusalem, and in order to accuse\nthe Samaritans. The ambassadors were Zorobabel, and four others of the\nrulers; and as soon as the king knew from the ambassadors the accusations\nand complaints they brought against the Samaritans, he gave them an epistle\nto be carried to the governors and council of Samaria; the contents of\nwhich epistle were these: \"King Darius to Tanganas and Sambabas, the\ngovernors of the Sainaritans, to Sadraces and Bobelo, and the rest of their\nfellow servants that are in Samaria: Zorobabel, Ananias, and Mordecai,\nthe ambassadors of the Jews, complain of you, that you obstruct them in\nthe building of the temple, and do not supply them with the expenses which\nI commanded you to do for the offering their sacrifices.

Now about\nthis time a son of Jeshua, whose name was Joacim, was the high priest.\nMoreover, there was now in Babylon a righteous man, and one that enjoyed\na great reputation among the multitude. He was the principal priest of\nthe people, and his name was Esdras. He was very skillful in the laws of\nMoses, and was well acquainted with king Xerxes.

Accordingly,\nI have given command for that purpose; and let every one that hath a mind\ngo, according as it hath seemed good to me, and to my seven counselors,\nand this in order to their review of the affairs of Judea, to see whether\nthey be agreeable to the law of God.

Let it also\nbe lawful for thee and thy brethren to make as many vessels of silver and\ngold as thou pleasest. Thou shalt also dedicate those holy vessels which\nhave been given thee, and as many more as thou hast a mind to make, and\nshall take the expenses out of the king's treasury. I have, moreover, written\nto the treasurers of Syria and Phoenicia, that they take care of those\naffairs that Esdras the priest, and reader of the laws of God, is sent\nabout. And that God may not be at all angry with me, or with my children,\nI grant all that is necessary for sacrifices to God, according to the law,\nas far as a hundred cori of wheat. And I enjoin you not to lay any treacherous\nimposition, or any tributes, upon their priests or Levites, or. sacred\nsingers, or porters, or sacred servants, or scribes of the temple.

So he read the epistle at Babylon to those Jews that were there;\nbut he kept the epistle itself, and sent a copy of it to all those of his\nown nation that were in Media. And when these Jews had understood what\npiety the king had towards God, and what kindness he had for Esdras, they\nwere all greatly pleased; nay, many of them took their effects with them,\nand came to Babylon, as very desirous of going down to Jerusalem; but then\nthe entire body of the people of Israel remained in that country; wherefore\nthere are but two tribes in Asia and Europe subject to the Iomans, while\nthe ten tribes are beyond Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude,\nand not to be estimated by numbers. Now there came a great number of priests,\nand Levites, and porters, and sacred singers, and sacred servants to Esdras.\nSo he gathered those that were in the captivity together beyond Euphrates,\nand staid there three days, and ordained a fast for them, that they might\nmake their prayers to God for their preservation, that they might suffer\nno misfortunes by the way, either from their enemies, or from any other\nill accident; for Esdras had said beforehand that he had told the king\nhow God would preserve them, and so he had not thought fit to request that\nhe would send horsemen to conduct them. So when they had finished their\nprayers, they removed from Euphrates on the twelfth day of the first month\nof the seventh year of the reign of Xerxes, and they came to Jerusalem\non the fifth month of the same year. Now Esdras presented the sacred money\nto the treasurers, who were of the family of the priests, of silver six\nhundred and fifty talents, vessels of silver one hundred talents, vessels\nof gold twenty talents, vessels of brass, that was more precious than gold,\n twelve\ntalents by weight; for these Presents had been made by the king and his\ncounselors, and by all the Israelites that staid at Babylon. So when Esdras\nhad delivered these things to the priests, he gave to God, as the appointed\nsacrifices of whole burnt-offerings, twelve bulls on account of the common\npreservation of the people, ninety rams, seventy-two lambs, and twelve\nkids of the goats, for the remission of sins. He also delivered the king's\nepistle to the king's officers, and to the governors of Celesyria and Phoenicia;\nand as they were under a necessity of doing what was enjoined by him, they\nhonored our nation, and were assistant to them in all their necessities."}, "Now these things were truly done under the conduct of Esdras; and\nhe succeeded in them, because God esteemed him worthy of the success of\nhis conduct, on account of his goodness and righteousness. But some time\nafterward there came some persons to him, and brought an accusation against\ncertain of the multitude, and of the priests and Levites, who had transgressed\ntheir settlement, and dissolved the laws of their country, by marrying\nstrange wives, and had brought the family of the priests into confusion.\nThese persons desired him to support the laws, lest God should take up\na general anger against them all, and reduce them to a calamitous condition\nagain. Hereupon he rent his garment immediately, out of grief, and pulled\noff the hair of his head and beard, and cast himself upon the ground, because\nthis crime had reached the principal men among the people; and considering\nthat if he should enjoin them to cast out their wives, and the children\nthey had by them, he should not be hearkener to, he continued lying upon\nthe ground. However, all the better sort came running to him, who also\nthemselves wept, and partook of the grief he was under for what had been\ndone. So Esdras rose up from the ground, and stretched out his hands towards\nheaven, and said that he was ashamed to look towards it, because of the\nsins which the people had committed, while they had cast out of their memories\nwhat their fathers had undergone on account of their wickedness; and he\nbesought God, who had saved a seed and a remnant out of the calamity and\ncaptivity they had been in, and had restored them again to Jerusalem, and\nto their own land, and had obliged the kings of Persia to have compassion\non them, that he would also forgive them their sins they had now committed,\nwhich, though they deserved death, yet, was it agreeable to the mercy of\nGod, to remit even to these the punishment due to them.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This procedure of Esdras, and of the best part of the Jewish nation, after\ntheir return from the Babylonish captivity, of reducing the Jewish marriages,\nonce for all, to the strictness of the law of Moses, without any regard\nto the greatness of those who had broken it, and without regard to that\nnatural affection or compassion for their heathen wives, and their children\nby them, which made it so hard for Esdras to correct it, deserves greatly\nto be observed and imitated in all attempts for reformation among Christians,\nthe contrary conduct having ever been the bane of true religion, both among\nJews and Christians, while political views, or human passions, or prudential\nmotives, are suffered to take place instead of the Divine laws, and so\nthe blessing of God is forfeited, and the church still suffered to continue\ncorrupt from one generation to another.

So\nEsdras hearkened to this advice, and made the heads of the priests, and\nof the Levites, and of the Israelites, swear that they would put away those\nwives and children, according to the advice of Jechonias. And when he had\nreceived their oaths, he went in haste out of the temple into the chamber\nof Johanan, the son of Eliasib, and as he had hitherto tasted nothing at\nall for grief, so he abode there that day. And when proclamation was made,\nthat all those of the captivity should gather themselves together to Jerusalem,\nand those that did not meet there in two or three days should be banished\nfrom the multitude, and that their substance should b appropriated to the\nuses of the temple, according to the sentence of the elders, those that\nwere of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin came together in three days, viz.\non the twentieth day of the ninth month, which, according to the Hebrews,\nis called Tebeth, and according to the Macedonians, Apelleius. Now as they\nwere sitting in the upper room of the temple, where the elders also were\npresent, but were uneasy because of the cold, Esdras stood up and accused\nthem, and told them that they had sinned in marrying wives that were not\nof their own nation; but that now they would do a thing both pleasing to\nGod, and advantageous to themselves, if they would put those wives away.\nAccordingly, they all cried out that they would do so. That, however, the\nmultitude was great, and that the season of the year was winter, and that\nthis work would require more than one or two days. \"Let their rulers,\ntherefore, [said they,] and those that have married strange wives, come\nhither at a proper time, while the elders of every place, that are in common\nto estimate the number of those that have thus married, are to be there\nalso.\" Accordingly, this was resolved on by them, and they began the\ninquiry after those that had married strange wives on the first day of\nthe tenth month, and continued the inquiry to the first day of the next\nmonth, and found a great many of the posterity of Jeshua the high priest,\nand of the priests and Levites, and Israelites, who had a greater regard\nto the observation of the law than to their natural affection, \nand immediately cast out their wives, and the children which were born\nof them. And in order to appease God, they offered sacrifices, and slew\nrams, as oblations to him; but it does not seem to me to be necessary to\nset down the names of these men.

Accordingly, he\nstood in the midst of the multitude and read them; and this he did from\nmorning to noon. Now, by hearing the laws read to them, they were instructed\nto be righteous men for the present and for the future; but as for their\npast offenses, they were displeased at themselves, and proceeded to shed\ntears on their account, as considering with themselves that if they had\nkept the law, they had endured none of these miseries which they had experienced.\nBut when Esdras saw them in that disposition, he bade them go home, and\nnot weep, for that it was a festival, and that they ought not to weep thereon,\nfor that it was not lawful so to do. \nHe exhorted them rather to proceed immediately to feasting, and to do what\nwas suitable to a feast, and what was agreeable to a day of joy; but to\nlet their repentance and sorrow for their former sins be a security and\na guard to them, that they fell no more into the like offenses.

Whereupon he prayed to God to give him favor, and afford\nhim the power of persuading by his words, and said, \"How can I, O\nking, appear otherwise than thus, and not be in trouble, while I hear that\nthe walls of Jerusalem, the city where are the sepulchers of my fathers,\nare thrown down to the ground, and that its gates are consumed by fire?\nBut do thou grant me the favor to go and build its wall, and to finish\nthe building of the temple.\" Accordingly, the king gave him a signal\nthat he freely granted him what he asked; and told him that he should carry\nan epistle to the governors, that they might pay him due honor, and afford\nhim whatsoever assistance he wanted, and as he pleased. \"Leave off\nthy sorrow then,\" said the king, \"and be cheerful in the performance\nof thy office hereafter.\" So Nehemiah worshipped God, and gave the\nking thanks for his promise, and cleared up his sad and cloudy countenance,\nby the pleasure he had from the king's promises.

But none\nof these things could deter Nehemiah from being diligent about the work;\nhe only set a number of men about him as a guard to his body, and so unweariedly\npersevered therein, and was insensible of any trouble, out of his desire\nto perfect this work. And thus did he attentively, and with great forecast,\ntake care of his own safety; not that he feared death, but of this persuasion,\nthat if he were dead, the walls for his citizens would never be raised.\nHe also gave orders that the builders should keep their ranks, and have\ntheir armor on while they were building. Accordingly, the mason had his\nsword on, as well as he that brought the materials for building.

The cups\nwith which the waiters ministered were of gold, and adorned with precious\nstones, for pleasure and for sight.

Accordingly, he was persuaded to follow this\nadvice, and gave order to certain persons to choose out of the virgins\nthat were in his kingdom those that were esteemed the most comely.

This troubled the king; but he discovered the truth, and hanged\nthe eunuchs upon a cross, while at that time he gave no reward ]: to Mordecai,\nwho had been the occasion of his preservation. He only bid the scribes\nto set down his name in the records, and bid him stay in the palace, as\nan intimate friend of the king.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Whether this adoration required of Mordecai to Haman were by him deemed\ntoo like the adoration due only to God, as Josephus seems here to think,\nas well as the Septuagint interpreters also, by their translation of Esther\n13:12-14, or whether he thought he ought to pay no sort of adoration to\nan Amalekite, which nation had been such great sinners as to have been\nuniversally devoted to destruction by God himself, Exodus 17:14-16; 1 Samuel\n15:18, or whether both causes concurred, cannot now, I doubt, be certainly\ndetermined."}, "#text": "Now there was one Haman, the son of Amedatha, by birth an Amalekite,\nthat used to go in to the king; and the foreigners and Persians worshipped\nhim, as Artaxerxes had commanded that such honor should be paid to him;\nbut Mordecai was so wise, and so observant of his own country's laws, that\nhe would not worship the man \nWhen Haman observed this, he inquired whence he came; and when he understood\nthat he was a Jew, he had indignation at him, and said within himself,\nthat whereas the Persians, who were free men, worshipped him, this man,\nwho was no better than a slave, does not vouchsafe to do so. And when he\ndesired to punish Mordecai, he thought it too small a thing to request\nof the king that he alone might be punished; he rather determined to abolish\nthe whole nation, for he was naturally an enemy to the Jews, because the\nnation of the Amalekites, of which he was; had been destroyed by them.\nAccordingly he came to the king, and accused them, saying, \"There\nis a certain wicked nation, and it is dispersed over all the habitable\nearth the was under his dominion; a nation separate from others, unsociable,\nneither admitting the same sort of Divine worship that others do, nor using\nlaws like to the laws of others, at enmity with thy people, and with all\nmen, both in their manners and practices. Now, if thou wilt be a benefactor\nto thy subjects, thou wilt give order to destroy them utterly, and not\nleave the least remains of them, nor preserve any of them, either for slaves\nor for captives.\" :But that the king might not be damnified by the\nloss of the tributes which the Jews paid him, Haman promised to give him\nout of his own estate forty thousand talents whensoever he pleased; and\nhe said he would pay this money very willingly, that the kingdom might.\nbe freed from such a misfortune."}, "When Haman had made this petition, the king both forgave him the\nmoney, and granted him the men, to do what he would with them. So Haman,\nhaving gained what he desired, sent out immediately a decree, as from the\nking, to all nations, the contents whereof were these: \"Artaxerxes,\nthe great king, to the rulers of the hundred twenty and seven provinces,\nfrom India to Ethiopia, sends this writing. Whereas I have governed many\nnations, and obtained the dominions of all the habitable earth, according\nto my desire, and have not been obliged to do any thing that is insolent\nor cruel to my subjects by such my power, but have showed myself mild and\ngentle, by taking care of their peace and good order, and have sought how\nthey might enjoy those blessings for all time to come. And whereas I have\nbeen kindly informed by Haman, who, on account of his prudence and justice,\nis the first in my esteem, and in dignity, and only second to myself, for\nhis fidelity and constant good-will to me, that there is an ill-natured\nnation intermixed with all mankind, that is averse to our laws, and not\nsubject to kings, and of a different conduct of life from others, that\nhateth monarchy, and of a disposition that is pernicious to our affairs,\nI give order that all these men, of whom Haman our second father hath informed\nus, be destroyed, with their wives and children, and that none of them\nbe spared, and that none prefer pity to them before obedience to this decree.\nAnd this I will to be executed on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month\nof this present year, that so when all that have enmity to us are destroyed,\nand this in one day, we may be allowed to lead the rest of our lives in\npeace hereafter.\" Now when this decree was brought to the cities,\nand to the country, all were ready for the destruction and entire abolishment\nof the Jews, against the day before mentioned; and they were very hasty\nabout it at Shushan, in particular. Accordingly, the king and Haman spent\ntheir time in feasting together with good cheer and wine, but the city\nwas in disorder.", "Now when Mordecai was informed of what was done, he rent his clothes,\nand put on sackcloth, and sprinkled ashes upon his head, and went about\nthe city, crying out, that \"a nation that had been injurious to no\nman was to be destroyed.\" And he went on saying thus as far as to\nthe king's palace, and there he stood, for it was not lawful for him to\ngo into it in that habit. The same thing was done by all the Jews that\nwere in the several cities wherein this decree was published, with lamentation\nand mourning, on account of the calamities denounced against them. But\nas soon as certain persons had told the queen that Mordecai stood before\nthe court in a mourning habit, she was disturbed at this report, and sent\nout such as should change his garments; but when he could not be induced\nto put off his sackcloth, because the sad occasion that forced him to put\nit on was not yet ceased, she called the eunuch Acratheus, for he was then\npresent, and sent him to Mordecai, in order to know of him what sad accident\nhad befallen him, for which he was in mourning, and would not put off the\nhabit he had put on at her desire. Then did Mordecai inform the eunuch\nof the occasion of his mourning, and of the decree which was sent by the\nking into all the country, and of the promise of money whereby Haman brought\nthe destruction of their nation. He also gave him a copy of what was proclaimed\nat Shushan, to be carried to Esther; and he charged her to petition the\nking about this matter, and not to think it a dishonorable thing in her\nto put on a humble habit, for the safety of her nation, wherein she might\ndeprecate the ruin of the Jews, who were in danger of it; for that Haman,\nwhose dignity was only inferior to that of the king, had accused the Jews,\nand had irritated the king against them. When she was informed of this,\nshe sent to Mordecai again, and told him that she was not called by the\nking, and that he who goes in to him without being called, is to be slain,\nunless when he is willing to save any one, he holds out his golden scepter\nto him; but that to whomsoever he does so, although he go in without being\ncalled, that person is so far from being slain, that he obtains pardon,\nand is entirely preserved. Now when the eunuch carried this message from\nEsther to Mordecai, he bade him also tell her that she must not only provide\nfor her own preservation, but for the common preservation of her nation,\nfor that if she now neglected this opportunity, there would certainly arise\nhelp to them from God some other way, but she and her father's house would\nbe destroyed by those whom she now despised. But Esther sent the very same\neunuch back to Mordecai [to desire him] to go to Shushan, and to gather\nthe Jews that were there together to a congregation, and to fast and abstain\nfrom all sorts of food, on her account, and [to let him know that] she\nwith her maidens would do the same: and then she promised that she would\ngo to the king, though it were against the law, and that if she must die\nfor it, she would not refuse it.", "Accordingly, Mordecai did as Esther had enjoined him, and made the\npeople fast; and he besought God, together with them, not to overlook his\nnation, particularly at this time, when it was going to be destroyed; but\nthat, as he had often before provided for them, and forgiven, when they\nhad sinned, so he would now deliver them from that destruction which was\ndenounced against them; for although it was not all the nation that had\noffended, yet must they so ingloriously be slain, and that he was himself\nthe occasion of the wrath of Haman, \"Because,\" said he, \"I\ndid not worship him, nor could I endure to pay that honor to him which\nI used to pay to thee, O Lord; for upon that his anger hath he contrived\nthis present mischief against those that have not transgressed thy laws.\"\nThe same supplications did the multitude put up, and entreated that God\nwould provide for their deliverance, and free the Israelites that were\nin all the earth from this calamity which was now coming upon them, for\nthey had it before their eyes, and expected its coming. Accordingly, Esther\nmade supplication to God after the manner of her country, by casting herself\ndown upon the earth, and putting on her mourning garments, and bidding\nfarewell to meat and drink, and all delicacies, for three days' time; and\nshe entreated God to have mercy upon her, and make her words appear persuasive\nto the king, and render her countenance more beautiful than it was before,\nthat both by her words and beauty she might succeed, for the averting of\nthe king's anger, in case he were at all irritated against her, and for\nthe consolation of those of her own country, now they were in the utmost\ndanger of perishing; as also that he would excite a hatred in the king\nagainst the enemies of the Jews, and those that had contrived their future\ndestruction, if they proved to be contemned by him.", "When Esther had used this supplication for three days, she put off\nthose garments, and changed her habit, and adorned herself as became a\nqueen, and took two of her handmaids with her, the one of which supported\nher, as she gently leaned upon her, and the other followed after, and lifted\nup her large train (which swept along the ground) with the extremities\nof her fingers. And thus she came to the king, having a blushing redness\nin her countenance, with a pleasant agreeableness in her behavior; yet\ndid she go in to him with fear; and as soon as she was come over against\nhim, as he was sitting on his throne, in his royal apparel, which was a\ngarment interwoven with gold and precious stones, which made him seem to\nher more terrible, especially when he looked at her somewhat severely,\nand with a countenance on fire with anger, her joints failed her immediately,\nout of the dread she was in, and she fell down sideways in a swoon: but\nthe king changed his mind, which happened, as I suppose, by the will of\nGod, and was concerned for his wife, lest her fear should bring some very\nill thing upon her, and he leaped from his throne, and took her in his\narms, and recovered her, by embracing her, and speaking comfortably to\nher, and exhorting her to be of good cheer, and not to suspect any thing\nthat was sad on account of her coming to him without being called, because\nthat law was made for subjects, but that she, who was a queen, as well\nas he a king, might be entirely secure; and as he said this, he put the\nscepter into her hand, and laid his rod upon her neck, on account of the\nlaw; and so freed her from her fear. And after she had recovered herself\nby these encouragements, she said, \"My lord, it is not easy for me,\non the sudden, to say what hath happened, for as soon as I saw thee to\nbe great, and comely, and terrible, my spirit departed from me, and I had\nno soul left in me.\" And while it was with difficulty, and in a low\nvoice, that she could say thus much, the king was in a great agony and\ndisorder, and encouraged Esther to be of good cheer, and to expect better\nfortune, since he was ready, if occasion should require it, to grant her\nthe half of his kingdom. Accordingly, Esther desired that he and his friend\nHaman would come to her to a banquet, for she said she had prepared a supper\nfor him. He consented to it; and when they were there, as they were drinking,\nhe bid Esther to let him know what she desired; for that she should not\nbe disappointed though she should desire the half of his kingdom. But she\nput off the discovery of her petition till the next day, if he would come\nagain, together with Haman, to her banquet.", "Now when the king had promised so to do, Haman went away very glad,\nbecause he alone had the honor of supping with the king at Esther's banquet,\nand because no one else partook of the same honor with kings but himself;\nyet when he saw Mordecai in the court, he was very much displeased, for\nhe paid him no manner of respect when he saw him. So he went home and called\nfor his wife Zeresh, and his friends, and when they were come, he showed\nthem what honor he enjoyed not only from the king, but from the queen also,\nfor as he alone had that day supped with her, together with the king, so\nwas he also invited again for the next day; \"yet,\" said he, \"am\nI not pleased to see Mordecai the Jew in the court.\" Hereupon his\nwife Zeresh advised him to give order that a gallows should be made fifty\ncubits high, and that in the morning he should ask it of the king that\nMordecai might be hanged thereon. So he commended her advice, and gave\norder to his servants to prepare the gallows, and to place it in the court,\nfor the punishment of Mordecai thereon, which was accordingly prepared.\nBut God laughed to scorn the wicked expectations of Haman; and as he knew\nwhat the event would be, he was delighted at it, for that night he took\naway the king's sleep; and as the king was not willing to lose the time\nof his lying awake, but to spend it in something that might be of advantage\nto his kingdom, he commanded the scribe to bring him the chronicles of\nthe former kings, and the records of his own actions; and when he had brought\nthem, and was reading them, one was found to have received a country on\naccount of his excellent management on a certain occasion, and the name\nof the country was set down; another was found to have had a present made\nhim on account of his fidelity: then the scribe came to Bigthan and Teresh,\nthe eunuchs that had made a conspiracy against the king, which Mordecai\nhad discovered; and when the scribe said no more but that, and was going\non to another history, the king stopped him, and inquired \"whether\nit was not added that Mordecai had a reward given him?\" and when he\nsaid there was no such addition, he bade him leave off; and he inquired\nof those that were appointed for that purpose, what hour of the night it\nwas; and when he was informed that it was already day, he gave order, that\nif they found any one of his friends already come, and standing before\nthe court, they should tell him. Now it happened that Haman was found there,\nfor he was come sooner than ordinary to petition the king to have Mordecai\nput to death; and when the servants said that Haman was before the court,\nhe bid them call him in; and when he was come in, he said, \"Because\nI know that thou art my only fast friend, I desire thee to give me advice\nhow I may honor one that I greatly love, and that after a manner suitable\nto my magnificence.\" Now Haman reasoned with himself, that what opinion\nhe should give it would be for himself, since it was he alone who was beloved\nby the king: so he gave that advice which he thought of all other the best;\nfor he said, \"If thou wouldst truly honor a man whom thou sayest thou\ndost love, give order that he may ride on horseback, with the same garment\non which thou wearest, and with a gold chain about his neck, and let one\nof thy intimate friends go before him, and proclaim through the whole city,\nthat whosoever the king honoreth obtaineth this mark of his honor.\"\nThis was the advice which Haman gave, out of a supposal that such a reward\nwould come to himself. Hereupon the king was pleased with the advice, and\nsaid, \"Go thou therefore, for thou hast the horse, the garment, and\nthe chain, ask for Mordecai the Jew, and give him those things, and go\nbefore his horse and proclaim accordingly; for thou art,\" said he,\n\"my intimate friend, and hast given me good advice; be thou then the\nminister of what thou hast advised me to. This shall be his reward from\nus, for preserving my life.\" When he heard this order, which was entirely\nunexpected, he was confounded in his mind, and knew not what to do. However,\nhe went out and led the horse, and took the purple garment, and the golden\nchain for the neck, and finding Mordecai before the court, clothed in sackcloth,\nhe bid him put that garment off, and put the purple garment on. But Mordecai,\nnot knowing the truth of the matter, but thinking that it was done in mockery,\nsaid, \"O thou wretch, the vilest of all mankind, dost thou thus laugh\nat our calamities?\" But when he was satisfied that the king bestowed\nthis honor upon him, for the deliverance he had procured him when he convicted\nthe eunuchs who had conspired against him, he put on that purple garment\nwhich the king always wore, and put the chain about his neck, and got on\nhorseback, and went round the city, while Haman went before and proclaimed,\n\"This shall be the reward which the king will bestow on every one\nwhom he loves, and esteems worthy of honor.\" And when they had gone\nround the city, Mordecai went in to the king; but Haman went home, out\nof shame, and informed his wife and friends of what had happened, and this\nwith tears; who said, that he would never be able to be revenged of Mordecai,\nfor that God was with him.", "Now while these men were thus talking one to another, Esther's eunuchs\nhastened Haman away to come to supper; but one of the eunuchs, named Sabuchadas,\nsaw the gallows that was fixed in Haman's house, and inquired of one of\nhis servants for what purpose they had prepared it. So he knew that it\nwas for the queen's uncle, because Haman was about to petition the king\nthat he might be punished; but at present he held his peace. Now when the\nking, with Haman, were at the banquet, he desired the queen to tell him\nwhat gifts she desired to obtain, and assured her that she should have\nwhatsoever she had a mind to. She then lamented the danger her people were\nin; and said that \"she and her nation were given up to be destroyed,\nand that she, on that account, made this her petition; that she would not\nhave troubled him if he had only given order that they should be sold into\nbitter servitude, for such a misfortune would not have been intolerable;\nbut she desired that they might be delivered from such destruction.\"\nAnd when the king inquired of her whom was the author of this misery to\nthem, she then openly accused Haman, and convicted him, that he had been\nthe wicked instrument of this, and had formed this plot against them. When\nthe king was hereupon in disorder, and was gone hastily out of the banquet\ninto the gardens, Haman began to intercede with Esther, and to beseech\nher to forgive him, as to what he had offended, for he perceived that he\nwas in a very bad case. And as he had fallen upon the queen's bed, and\nwas making supplication to her, the king came in, and being still more\nprovoked at what he saw, \"O thou wretch,\" said he, \"thou\nvilest of mankind, dost thou aim to force in wife?\" And when Haman\nwas astonished at this, and not able to speak one word more, Sabuchadas\nthe eunuch came in and accused Haman, and said,\" He found a gallows\nat his house, prepared for Mordecai; for that the servant told him so much\nupon his inquiry, when he was sent to him to call him to supper.\"\nHe said further, that the gallows was fifty cubits high: which, when the\nking heard, he determined that Haman should be punished after no other\nmanner than that which had been devised by him against Mordecai; so he\ngave order immediately that he should be hung upon those gallows, and be\nput to death after that manner. And from hence I cannot forbear to admire\nGod, and to learn hence his wisdom and his justice, not only in punishing\nthe wickedness of Haman, but in so disposing it, that he should undergo\nthe very same punishment which he had contrived for another; as also because\nthereby he teaches others this lesson, that what mischiefs any one prepares\nagainst another, he, without knowing of it, first contrives it against\nhimself.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The true reason why king Artaxerxes did not here properly revoke his former\nbarbarous decree for the universal slaughter of the Jews, but only empowered\nand encouraged the Jews to fight for their lives, and to kill their enemies,\nif they attempted their destruction, seems to have been that old law of\nthe Medes and Persians, not yet laid aside, that whatever decree was signed\nboth by the king and his lords could not be changed, but remained unalterable,\nDaniel 6:7-9, 12, 15, 17; Esther 1:19; 8:8.

Nor is\nit to me improbable that those seventy-five thousand eight hundred of the\nJews' enemies which were soon destroyed by the Jews, on the permission\nof the king, which must be on some great occasion, were Amalekites, their\nold and hereditary enemies, Exodus 17:14, 15; and that thereby was fulfilled\nBalaam's prophecy, \"Amalek was the first of the nations, but his latter\nend shall be, that he perish for ever\" Numbers 24:20."}], "#text": "Wherefore Haman, who had immoderately abused the honor he had from\nthe king, was destroyed after this manner, and the king granted his estate\nto the queen. He also called for Mordecai, (for Esther had informed him\nthat she was akin to him,) and gave that ring to Mordecai which he had\nbefore given to Haman. The queen also gave Haman's estate to Mordecai;\nand prayed the king to deliver the nation of the Jews from the fear of\ndeath, and showed him what had been written over all the country by Haman\nthe son of Ammedatha; for that if her country were destroyed, and her countrymen\nwere to perish, she could not bear to live herself any longer. So the king\npromised her that he would not do any thing that should be disagreeable\nto her, nor contradict what she desired; but he bid her write what she\npleased about the Jews, in the king's name, and seal it with his seal,\nand send it to all his kingdom, for that those who read epistles whose\nauthority is secured by having the king's seal to them, would no way contradict\nwhat was written therein. So he commanded the king's scribes to be sent\nfor, and to write to the nations, on the Jews' behalf, and to his lieutenants\nand governors, that were over his hundred twenty and seven provinces, from\nIndia to Ethiopia. Now the contents of this epistle were these: \"The\ngreat king Artaxerxes to our rulers, and those that are our faithful subjects,\nsendeth greeting. \nMany men there are who, on account of the greatness of the benefits bestowed\non them, and because of the honor which they have obtained from the wonderful\nkind treatment of those that bestowed it, are not only injurious to their\ninferiors, but do not scruple to do evil to those that have been their\nbenefactors, as if they would take away gratitude from among men, and by\ntheir insolent abuse of such benefits as they never expected, they turn\nthe abundance they have against those that are the authors of it, and suppose\nthey shall lie concealed from God in that case, and avoid that vengeance\nwhich comes from him. Some of these men, when they have had the management\nof affairs committed to them by their friends, and bearing private malice\nof their own against some others, by deceiving those that have the power,\npersuade them to be angry at such as have done them no harm, till they\nare in danger of perishing, and this by laying accusations and calumnies:\nnor is this state of things to be discovered by ancient examples, or such\nas we have learned by report only, but by some examples of such impudent\nattempts under our own eyes; so that it is not fit to attend any longer\nto calumnies and accusations, nor to the persuasions of others, but to\ndetermine what any one knows of himself to have been really done, and to\npunish what justly deserves it, and to grant favors to such as are innocent.\nThis hath been the case of Haman, the son of Ammedatha, by birth an Amalekite,\nand alien from the blood of the Persians, who, when he was hospitably entertained\nby us, and partook of that kindness which we bear to all men to so great\na degree, as to be called my father, and to be all along worshipped, and\nto have honor paid him by all in the second rank after the royal honor\ndue to ourselves, he could not bear his good fortune, nor govern the magnitude\nof his prosperity with sound reason; nay, he made a conspiracy against\nme and my life, who gave him his authority, by endeavoring to take away\nMordecai, my benefactor, and my savior, and by basely and treacherously\nrequiring to have Esther, the partner of my life, and of my dominion, brought\nto destruction; for he contrived by this means to deprive me of my faithful\nfriends, and transfer the government to others: \nbut since I perceived that these Jews, that were by this pernicious fellow\ndevoted to destruction, were not wicked men, but conducted their lives\nafter the best manner, and were men dedicated to the worship of that God\nwho hath preserved the kingdom to me and to my ancestors, I do not only\nfree them from the punishment which the former epistle, which was sent\nby Haman, ordered to be inflicted on them, to which if you refuse obedience,\nyou shall do well; but I will that they have all honor paid to them.

But now the rulers of the provinces, and the tyrants, and the\nkings, and the scribes, had the Jews in esteem; for the fear they were\nin of Mordecai forced them to act with discretion. Now when the royal decree\nwas come to all the country that was subject to the king, it fell out that\nthe Jews at Shushan slew five hundred of their enemies; and when the king\nhad told Esther the number of those that were slain in that city, but did\nnot well know what had been done in the provinces, he asked her whether\nshe would have any thing further done against them, for that it should\nbe done accordingly: upon which she desired that the Jews might be permitted\nto treat their remaining enemies in the same manner the next day; as also\nthat they might hang the ten sons of Haman upon the gallows. So the king\npermitted the Jews so to do, as desirous not to contradict Esther. So they\ngathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the month Dystrus,\nand slew about three hundred of their enemies, but touched nothing of what\nriches they had. Now there were slain by the Jews that were in the country,\nand in the other cities, seventy-five thousand of their enemies, and these\nwere slain on the thirteenth day of the month, and the next day they kept\nas a festival. In like manner the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves\ntogether, and feasted on the fourteenth day, and that which followed it;\nwhence it is that even now all the Jews that are in the habitable earth\nkeep these days festival, and send portions to one another. Mordecai also\nwrote to the Jews that lived in the kingdom of Artaxerxes to observe these\ndays, and celebrate them as festivals, and to deliver them down to posterity,\nthat this festival might continue for all time to come, and that it might\nnever be buried in oblivion; for since they were about to be destroyed\non these days by Haman, they would do a right thing, upon escaping the\ndanger in them, and on them inflicting punishment on their enemies, to\nobserve those days, and give thanks to God on them; for which cause the\nJews still keep the forementioned days, and call them days of Phurim [or\nPurim.] \nAnd Mordecai became a great and illustrious person with the king, and assisted\nhim in the government of the people. He also lived with the queen; so that\nthe affairs of the Jews were, by their means, better than they could ever\nhave hoped for.

Now Jesus was the brother of John, and was\na friend of Bagoses, who had promised to procure him the high priesthood.\nIn confidence of whose support, Jesus quarreled with John in the temple,\nand so provoked his brother, that in his anger his brother slew him. Now\nit was a horrible thing for John, when he was high priest, to perpetrate\nso great a crime, and so much the more horrible, that there never was so\ncruel and impious a thing done, neither by the Greeks nor Barbarians. However,\nGod did not neglect its punishment, but the people were on that very account\nenslaved, and the temple was polluted by the Persians. Now when Bagoses,\nthe general of Artaxerxes's army, knew that John, the high priest of the\nJews, had slain his own brother Jesus in the temple, he came upon the Jews\nimmediately, and began in anger to say to them,\" Have you had the\nimpudence to perpetrate a murder in your temple?\" And as he was aiming\nto go into the temple, they forbade him so to do; but he said to them,\"\nAm not I purer than he that was slain in the temple?\" And when he\nhad said these words, he went into the temple. Accordingly, Bagoses made\nuse of this pretense, and punished the Jews seven years for the murder\nof Jesus."}, "Now when John had departed this life, his son Jaddua succeeded in\nthe high priesthood. He had a brother, whose name was Manasseh. :Now there\nwas one Sanballat, who was sent by Darius, the last king [of Persia], into\nSamaria. He was a Cutheam by birth; of which stock were the Samaritans\nalso. This man knew that the city Jerusalem was a famous city, and that\ntheir kings had given a great deal of trouble to the Assyrians, and the\npeople of Celesyria; so that he willingly gave his daughter, whose name\nwas Nicaso, in marriage to Manasseh, as thinking this alliance by marriage\nwould be a pledge and security that the nation of the Jews should continue\ntheir good-will to him.", {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7002611", "#text": "Pamphylia"}, "#text": "ABOUT this time it was that Philip, king of Macedon, was treacherously\nassaulted and slain at Egae by Pausanias, the son of Cerastes, who was\nderived from the family of Oreste, and his son Alexander succeeded him\nin the kingdom; who, passing over the Hellespont, overcame the generals\nof Darius's army in a battle fought at Granicum. So he marched over Lydia,\nand subdued Ionia, and overran Caria, and fell upon the places of ,\nas has been related elsewhere."}, "But the elders of Jerusalem being very uneasy that the brother of\nJaddua the high priest, though married to a foreigner, should be a partner\nwith him in the high priesthood, quarreled with him; for they esteemed\nthis man's marriage a step to such as should be desirous of transgressing\nabout the marriage of [strange] wives, and that this would be the beginning\nof a mutual society with foreigners, although the offense of some about\nmarriages, and their having married wives that were not of their own country,\nhad been an occasion of their former captivity, and of the miseries they\nthen underwent; so they commanded Manasseh to divorce his wife, or not\nto approach the altar, the high priest himself joining with the people\nin their indignation against his brother, and driving him away from the\naltar. Whereupon Manasseh came to his father-in-law, Sanballat, and told\nhim, that although he loved his daughter Nicaso, yet was he not willing\nto be deprived of his sacerdotal dignity on her account, which was the\nprincipal dignity in their nation, and always continued in the same family.\nAnd then Sanballat promised him not only to preserve to him the honor of\nhis priesthood, but to procure for him the power and dignity of a high\npriest, and would make him governor of all the places he himself now ruled,\nif he would keep his daughter for his wife. He also told him further, that\nhe would build him a temple like that at Jerusalem, upon Mount Gerizzini,\nwhich is the highest of all the mountains that are in Samaria; and he promised\nthat he would do this with the approbation of Darius the king. Manasseh\nwas elevated with these promises, and staid with Sanballat, upon a supposal\nthat he should gain a high priesthood, as bestowed on him by Darius, for\nit happened that Sanballat was then in years. But there was now a great\ndisturbance among the people of Jerusalem, because many of those priests\nand Levites were entangled in such matches; for they all revolted to Manasseh,\nand Sanballat afforded them money, and divided among them land for tillage,\nand habitations also, and all this in order every way to gratify his son-in-law.", "About this time it was that Darius heard how Alexander had passed\nover the Hellespont, and had beaten his lieutenants in the battle at Granicum,\nand was proceeding further; whereupon he gathered together an army of horse\nand foot, and determined that he would meet the Macedonians before they\nshould assault and conquer all Asia. So he passed over the river Euphrates,\nand came over Taurus, the Cilician mountain, and at Issus of Cilicia he\nwaited for the enemy, as ready there to give him battle. Upon which Sanballat\nwas glad that Darius was come down; and told Manasseh that he would suddenly\nperform his promises to him, and this as soon as ever Darius should come\nback, after he had beaten his enemies; for not he only, but all those that\nwere in Asia also, were persuaded that the Macedonians would not so much\nas come to a battle with the Persians, on account of their multitude. But\nthe event proved otherwise than they expected; for the king joined battle\nwith the Macedonians, and was beaten, and lost a great part of his army.\nHis mother also, and his wife and children, were taken captives, and he\nfled into Persia. So Alexander came into Syria, and took Damascus; and\nwhen he had obtained Sidon, he besieged Tyre, when he sent all epistle\nto the Jewish high priest, to send him some auxiliaries, and to supply\nhis army with provisions; and that what presents he formerly sent to Darius,\nhe would now send to him, and choose the friendship of the Macedonians,\nand that he should never repent of so doing. But the high priest answered\nthe messengers, that he had given his oath to Darius not to bear arms against\nhim; and he said that he would not transgress this while Darius was in\nthe land of the living. Upon hearing this answer, Alexander was very angry;\nand though he determined not to leave Tyre, which was just ready to be\ntaken, yet as soon as he had taken it, he threatened that he would make\nan expedition against the Jewish high priest, and through him teach all\nmen to whom they must keep their oaths. So when he had, with a good deal\nof pains during the siege, taken Tyre, and had settled its affairs, he\ncame to the city of Gaza, and besieged both the city and him that was governor\nof the garrison, whose name was Babemeses.", "But Sanballat thought he had now gotten a proper opportunity to make\nhis attempt, so he renounced Darius, and taking with him seven thousand\nof his own subjects, he came to Alexander; and finding him beginning the\nsiege of Tyre, he said to him, that he delivered up to him these men, who\ncame out of places under his dominion, and did gladly accept of him for\nhis lord instead of Darius. So when Alexander had received him kindly,\nSanballat thereupon took courage, and spake to him about his present affair.\nHe told him that he had a son-in-law, Manasseh, who was brother to the\nhigh priest Jaddua; and that there were many others of his own nation,\nnow with him, that were desirous to have a temple in the places subject\nto him; that it would be for the king's advantage to have the strength\nof the Jews divided into two parts, lest when the nation is of one mind,\nand united, upon any attempt for innovation, it prove troublesome to kings,\nas it had formerly proved to the kings of Assyria. Whereupon Alexander\ngave Sanballat leave so to do, who used the utmost diligence, and built\nthe temple, and made Manasseh the priest, and deemed it a great reward\nthat his daughter's children should have that dignity; but when the seven\nmonths of the siege of Tyre were over, and the two months of the siege\nof Gaza, Sanballat died. Now Alexander, when he had taken Gaza, made haste\nto go up to Jerusalem; and Jaddua the high priest, when he heard that,\nwas in an agony, and under terror, as not knowing how he should meet the\nMacedonians, since the king was displeased at his foregoing disobedience.\nHe therefore ordained that the people should make supplications, and should\njoin with him in offering sacrifice to God, whom he besought to protect\nthat nation, and to deliver them from the perils that were coming upon\nthem; whereupon God warned him in a dream, which came upon him after he\nhad offered sacrifice, that he should take courage, and adorn the city,\nand open the gates; that the rest should appear in white garments, but\nthat he and the priests should meet the king in the habits proper to their\norder, without the dread of any ill consequences, which the providence\nof God would prevent. Upon which, when he rose from his sleep, he greatly\nrejoiced, and declared to all the warning he had received from God. According\nto which dream he acted entirely, and so waited for the coming of the king.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The place showed Alexander might be Daniel 7:6; 8:3-8, 20--22; 11:3; some\nor all of them very plain predictions of Alexander's conquests and successors."}, "#text": "And when he understood that he was not far from the city, he went\nout in procession, with the priests and the multitude of the citizens.\nThe procession was venerable, and the manner of it different from that\nof other nations. It reached to a place called Sapha, which name, translated\ninto Greek, signifies a prospect, for you have thence a prospect both of\nJerusalem and of the temple. And when the Phoenicians and the Chaldeans\nthat followed him thought they should have liberty to plunder the city,\nand torment the high priest to death, which the king's displeasure fairly\npromised them, the very reverse of it happened; for Alexander, when he\nsaw the multitude at a distance, in white garments, while the priests stood\nclothed with fine linen, and the high priest in purple and scarlet clothing,\nwith his mitre on his head, having the golden plate whereon the name of\nGod was engraved, he approached by himself, and adored that name, and first\nsaluted the high priest. The Jews also did all together, with one voice,\nsalute Alexander, and encompass him about; whereupon the kings of Syria\nand the rest were surprised at what Alexander had done, and supposed him\ndisordered in his mind. However, Parmenio alone went up to him, and asked\nhim how it came to pass that, when all others adored him, he should adore\nthe high priest of the Jews? To whom he replied, \"I did not adore\nhim, but that God who hath honored him with his high priesthood; for I\nsaw this very person in a dream, in this very habit, when I was at Dios\nin Macedonia, who, when I was considering with myself how I might obtain\nthe dominion of Asia, exhorted me to make no delay, but boldly to pass\nover the sea thither, for that he would conduct my army, and would give\nme the dominion over the Persians; whence it is that, having seen no other\nin that habit, and now seeing this person in it, and remembering that vision,\nand the exhortation which I had in my dream, I believe that I bring this\narmy under the Divine conduct, and shall therewith conquer Darius, and\ndestroy the power of the Persians, and that all things will succeed according\nto what is in my own mind.\" And when he had said this to Parmenio,\nand had given the high priest his right hand, the priests ran along by\nhim, and he came into the city. And when he went up into the temple, he\noffered sacrifice to God, according to the high priest's direction, and\nmagnificently treated both the high priest and the priests. And when the\nBook of Daniel was showed him \nwherein Daniel declared that one of the Greeks should destroy the empire\nof the Persians, he supposed that himself was the person intended. And\nas he was then glad, he dismissed the multitude for the present; but the\nnext day he called them to him, and bid them ask what favors they pleased\nof him; whereupon the high priest desired that they might enjoy the laws\nof their forefathers, and might pay no tribute on the seventh year. He\ngranted all they desired. And when they entreared him that he would permit\nthe Jews in Babylon and Media to enjoy their own laws also, he willingly\npromised to do hereafter what they desired. And when he said to the multitude,\nthat if any of them would enlist themselves in his army, on this condition,\nthat they should continue under the laws of their forefathers, and live\naccording to them, he was willing to take them with him, many were ready\nto accompany him in his wars."}, "So when Alexander had thus settled matters at Jerusalem, he led his\narmy into the neighboring cities; and when all the inhabitants to whom\nhe came received him with great kindness, the Samaritans, who had then\nShechem for their metropolis, (a city situate at Mount Gerizzim, and inhabited\nby apostates of the Jewish nation,) seeing that Alexander had so greatly\nhonored the Jews, determined to profess themselves Jews; for such is the\ndisposition of the Samaritans, as we have already elsewhere declared, that\nwhen the Jews are in adversity, they deny that they are of kin to them,\nand then they confess the truth; but when they perceive that some good\nfortune hath befallen them, they immediately pretend to have communion\nwith them, saying that they belong to them, and derive their genealogy\nfrom the posterity of Joseph, Ephraim, and Manasseh. Accordingly, they\nmade their address to the king with splendor, and showed great alacrity\nin meeting him at a little distance from Jerusalem. And when Alexander\nhad commended them, the Shechemites approached to him, taking with them\nthe troops that Sanballat had sent him, and they desired that he would\ncome to their city, and do honor to their temple also; to whom he promised,\nthat when he returned he would come to them. And when they petitioned that\nhe would remit the tribute of the seventh year to them, because they did\nbut sow thereon, he asked who they were that made such a petition; and\nwhen they said that they were Hebrews, but had the name of Sidonians, living\nat Shechem, he asked them again whether they were Jews; and when they said\nthey were not Jews, \"It was to the Jews,\" said he, \"that\nI granted that privilege; however, when I return, and am thoroughly informed\nby you of this matter, I will do what I shall think proper.\" And in\nthis manner he took leave of the Shechenlites; but ordered that the troops\nof Sanballat should follow him into Egypt, because there he designed to\ngive them lands, which he did a little after in Thebais, when he ordered\nthem to guard that country.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "emph": "koinophagia", "#text": "Here Josephus uses the very word  \"eating things\ncommon,\" for \"eating things unclean;\" as does our New Testament,\nActs x. 14,15, 28; xi. 8, 9; Rom. xiv. 14."}, "#text": "Now when Alexander was dead, the government was parted among his\nsuccessors, but the temple upon Mount Gerizzim remained.

And while these princes\nambitiously strove one against another, every one for his own principality,\nit came to pass that there were continual wars, and those lasting wars\ntoo; and the cities were sufferers, and lost a great many of their inhabitants\nin these times of distress, insomuch that all Syria, by the means of Ptolemy\nthe son of Lagus, underwent the reverse of that denomination of Savior,\nwhich he then had. He also seized upon Jerusalem, and for that end made\nuse of deceit and treachery; for as he came into the city on a sabbath\nday, as if he would offer sacrifices \nhe, without any trouble, gained the city, while the Jews did not oppose\nhim, for they did not suspect him to be their enemy; and he gained it thus,\nbecause they were free from suspicion of him, and because on that day they\nwere at rest and quietness; and when he had gained it, he ruled over it\nin a cruel manner.

And as he knew that the people of Jerusalem were most\nfaithful in the observation of oaths and covenants; and this from the answer\nthey made to Alexander, when he sent an embassage to them, after he had\nbeaten Darius in battle; so he distributed many of them into garrisons,\nand at Alexandria gave them equal privileges of citizens with the Macedonians\nthemselves; and required of them to take their oaths, that they would keep\ntheir fidelity to the posterity of those who committed these places to\ntheir care. Nay, there were not a few other Jews who, of their own accord,\nwent into Egypt, as invited by the goodness of the soil, and by the liberality\nof Ptolemy. However, there were disoders among their posterity, with relation\nto the Samaritans, on account of their resolution to preserve that conduct\nof life which was delivered to them by their forefathers, and they thereupon\ncontended one with another, while those of Jerusalem said that their temple\nwas holy, and resolved to send their sacrifices thither; but the Samaritans\nwere resolved that they should be sent to Mount Gerizzim."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Of the translation of the other parts of the Old Testament by seventy Egyptian\nJews, in the reigns of Ptolemy the son of Lagus, and Philadelphus; as also\nof the translation of the Pentateuch by seventy-two Jerusalem Jews, in\nthe seventh year of Philadelphus at Alexandria, as given us an account\nof by Aristeus, and thence by Philo and Josephus, with a vindication of\nAristeus's history; see the Appendix to Lit.

With this\nanswer he was much pleased; and gave order, that when they paid the soldiers\ntheir wages, they should lay down [a hundred and] twenty drachmas \nfor every one of the slaves?

And when they said\nthat their redemption money would amount to above four hundred talents,\nhe granted it. A copy of which decree I have determined to preserve, that\nthe magnanimity of this king may be made known. Its contents were as follows:\n\"Let ail those who were soldiers under our father, and who, when they\noverran Syria and Phoenicia, and laid waste Judea, took the Jews captives,\nand made them slaves, and brought them into our cities, and into this country,\nand then sold them; as also all those that were in my kingdom before them,\nand if there be any that have been lately brought thither, - be made free\nby those that possess them; and let them accept of [a hundred and] twenty\ndrachmas for every slave. And let the soldiers receive this redemption\nmoney with their pay, but the rest out of the king's treasury: for I suppose\nthat they were made captives without our father's consent, and against\nequity; and that their country was harassed by the insolence of the soldiers,\nand that, by removing them into Egypt, the soldiers have made a great profit\nby them. Out of regard therefore to justice, and out of pity to those that\nhave been tyrannized over, contrary to equity, I enjoin those that have\nsuch Jews in their service to set them at liberty, upon the receipt of\nthe before-mentioned sum; and that no one use any deceit about them, but\nobey what is here commanded. And I will that they give in their names within\nthree days after the publication of this edict, to such as are appointed\nto execute the same, and to produce the slaves before them also, for I\nthink it will be for the advantage of my affairs. And let every one that\nwill inform against those that do not obey this decree, and I will that\ntheir estates be confiscated into the king's treasury.\" When this\ndecree was read to the king, it at first contained the rest that is here\ninserted, and omitted only those Jews that had formerly been brought, and\nthose brought afterwards, which had not been distinctly mentioned; so he\nadded these clauses out of his humanity, and with great generosity. He\nalso gave order that the payment, which was likely to be done in a hurry,\nshould be divided among the king's ministers, and among the officers of\nhis treasury. When this was over, what the king had decreed was quickly\nbrought to a conclusion; and this in no more than seven days' time, the\nnumber of the talents paid for the captives being above four hundred and\nsixty, and this, because their masters required the [hundred and] twenty\ndrachmas for the children also, the king having, in effect, commanded that\nthese should be paid for, when he said in his decree, that they should\nreceive the forementioned sum for every slave."}, "Now when this had been done after so magnificent a manner, according\nto the king's inclinations, he gave order to Demetrius to give him in writing\nhis sentiments concerning the transcribing of the Jewish books; for no\npart of the administration is done rashly by these kings, but all things\nare managed with great circumspection. On which account I have subjoined\na copy of these epistles, and set down the multitude of the vessels sent\nas gifts [to Jerusalem], and the construction of every one, that the exactness\nof the artificers' workmanship, as it appeared to those that saw them,\nand which workman made every vessel, may be made manifest, and. this on\naccount of the excellency of the vessels themselves.

However, I thought it not improper to give an\naccount of those very valuable and artificially contrived vessels which\nthe king sent to God, that all may see how great a regard the king had\nfor God; for the king allowed a vast deal of expenses for these vessels,\nand came often to the workmen, and viewed their works, and suffered nothing\nof carelessness or negligence to be any damage to their operations. And\nI will relate how rich they were as well as I am able, although perhaps\nthe nature of this history may not require such a description; but I imagine\nI shall thereby recommend the elegant taste and magnanimity of this king\nto those that read this history.", "And first I will describe what belongs to the table. It was indeed\nin the king's mind to make this table vastly large in its dimensions; but\nthen he gave orders that they should learn what was the magnitude of the\ntable which was already at Jerusalem, and how large it was, and whether\nthere was a possibility of making one larger than it. And when he was informed\nhow large that was which was already there, and that nothing hindered but\na larger might be made, he said that he was willing to have one made that\nshould be five times as large as the present table; but his fear was, that\nit might be then useless in their sacred ministrations by its too great\nlargeness; for he desired that the gifts he presented them should not only\nbe there for show, but should be useful also in their sacred ministrations.\nAccording to which reasoning, that the former table was made of so moderate\na size for use, and not for want of gold, he resolved that he would not\nexceed the former table in largeness; but would make it exceed it in the\nvariety and elegancy of its materials. And as he was sagacious in observing\nthe nature of all things, and in having a just notion of what was new and\nsurprising, and where there was no sculptures, he would invent such as\nwere proper by his own skill, and would show them to the workmen, he commanded\nthat such sculptures should now be made, and that those which were delineated\nshould be most accurately formed by a constant regard to their delineation.", "When therefore the workmen had undertaken to make the table, they\nframed it in length two cubits [and a half], in breadth one cubit, and\nin height one cubit and a half; and the entire structure of the work was\nof gold. They withal made a crown of a hand-breadth round it, with wave-work\nwreathed about it, and with an engraving which imitated a cord, and was\nadmirably turned on its three parts; for as they were of a triangular figure,\nevery angle had the same disposition of its sculptures, that when you turned\nthem about, the very same form of them was turned about without any variation.\nNow that part of the crown-work that was enclosed under the table had its\nsculptures very beautiful; but that part which went round on the outside\nwas more elaborately adorned with most beautiful ornaments, because it\nwas exposed to sight, and to the view of the spectators; for which reason\nit was that both those sides which were extant above the rest were acute,\nand none of the angles, which we before told you were three, appeared less\nthan another, when the table was turned about. Now into the cordwork thus\nturned were precious stones inserted, in rows parallel one to the other,\nenclosed in golden buttons, which had ouches in them; but the parts which\nwere on the side of the crown, and were exposed to the sight, were adorned\nwith a row of oval figures obliquely placed, of the most excellent sort\nof precious stones, which imitated rods laid close, and encompassed the\ntable round about. But under these oval figures, thus engraven, the workmen\nhad put a crown all round it, where the nature of all sorts of fruit was\nrepresented, insomuch that the bunches of grapes hung up. And when they\nhad made the stones to represent all the kinds of fruit before mentioned,\nand that each in its proper color, they made them fast with gold round\nthe whole table. The like disposition of the oval figures, and of the engraved\nrods, was framed under the crown, that the table might on each side show\nthe same appearance of variety and elegancy of its ornaments; so that neither\nthe position of the wave-work nor of the crown might be different, although\nthe table were turned on the other side, but that the prospect of the same\nartificial contrivances might be extended as far as the feet; for there\nwas made a plate of gold four fingers broad, through the entire breadth\nof the table, into which they inserted the feet, and then fastened them\nto the table by buttons and button-holes, at the place where the crown\nwas situate, that so on what side soever of the table one should stand,\nit might exhibit the very same view of the exquisite workmanship, and of\nthe vast expeses bestowed upon it: but upon the table itself they engraved\na meander, inserting into it very valuable stones in the middle like stars,\nof various colors; the carbuncle and the emerald, each of which sent out\nagreeable rays of light to the spectators; with such stones of other sorts\nalso as were most curious and best esteemed, as being most precious in\ntheir kind. Hard by this meander a texture of net-work ran round it, the\nmiddle of which appeared like a rhombus, into which were inserted rock-crystal\nand amber, which, by the great resemblance of the appearance they made,\ngave wonderful delight to those that saw them. The chapiters of the feet\nimitated the first buddings of lilies, while their leaves were bent and\nlaid under the table, but so that the chives were seen standing upright\nwithin them. Their bases were made of a carbuncle; and the place at the\nbottom, which rested on that carbuncle, was one palm deep, and eight fingers\nin breadth. Now they had engraven upon it with a very fine tool, and with\na great deal of pains, a branch of ivy and tendrils of the vine, sending\nforth clusters of grapes, that you would guess they were nowise different\nfrom real tendrils; for they were so very thin, and so very far extended\nat their extremities, that they were moved with the wind, and made one\nbelieve that they were the product of nature, and not the representation\nof art. They also made the entire workmanship of the table appear to be\nthreefold, while the joints of the several parts were so united together\nas to be invisible, and the places where they joined could not be distinguished.\nNow the thickness of the table was not less than half a cubit. So that\nthis gift, by the king's great generosity, by the great value of the materials,\nand the variety of its exquisite structure, and the artificer's skill in\nimitating nature with graying tools, was at length brought to perfection,\nwhile the king was very desirous, that though in largeness it were not\nto be different from that which was already dedicated to God, yet that\nin exquisite workmanship, and the novelty of the contrivances, and in the\nsplendor of its construction, it should far exceed it, and be more illustrious\nthan that was.", "Now of the cisterns of gold there were two, whose sculpture was\nof scale-work, from its basis to its belt-like circle, with various sorts\nof stones enchased in the spiral circles. Next to which there was upon\nit a meander of a cubit in height; it was composed of stones of all sorts\nof colors. And next to this was the rod-work engraven; and next to that\nwas a rhombus in a texture of net-work, drawn out to the brim of the basin,\nwhile small shields, made of stones, beautiful in their kind, and of four\nfingers' depth, filled up the middle parts. About the top of the basin\nwere wreathed the leaves of lilies, and of the convolvulus, and the tendrils\nof vines in a circular manner. And this was the construction of the two\ncisterns of gold, each containing two firkins. But those which were of\nsilver were much more bright and splendid than looking-glasses, and you\nmight in them see the images that fell upon them more plainly than in the\nother. The king also ordered thirty vials; those of which the parts that\nwere of gold, and filled up with precious stones, were shadowed over with\nthe leaves of ivy and of vines, artificially engraven. And these were the\nvessels that were after an extraordinary manner brought to this perfection,\npartly by the skill of the workmen, who were admirable in such fine work,\nbut much more by the diligence and generosity of the king, who not only\nsupplied the artificers abundantly, and with great generosity, with what\nthey wanted, but he forbade public audiences for the time, and came and\nstood by the workmen, and saw the whole operation. And this was the cause\nwhy the workmen were so accurate in their performance, because they had\nregard to the king, and to his great concern about the vessels, and so\nthe more indefatigably kept close to the work.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The Talmudists say, that it is not lawful to write the law in letters of\ngold, contrary to this certain and very ancient example.

And when they\nwere come to Alexandria, and Ptolemy heard that they were come,and that\nthe seventy elders were come also, he presently sent for Andreas and Aristens,\nhis ambassadors, who came to him, and delivered him the epistle which they\nbrought him from the high priest, and made answer to all the questions\nhe put to them by word of mouth.

He then said\nthat he returned them thanks for coming to him, and still greater thanks\nto him that sent them; and, above all, to that God whose laws they appeared\nto be. Then did the elders, and those that were present with them, cry\nout with one voice, and wished all happiness to the king. Upon which he\nfell into tears by the violence of the pleasure he had, it being natural\nto men to afford the same indications in great joy that they do under sorrows.\nAnd when he had bid them deliver the books to those that were appointed\nto receive them, he saluted the men, and said that it was but just to discourse,\nin the first place, of the errand they were sent about, and then to address\nhimself to themselves.

This procedure was a\nsore grief to those that came from the cities into Egypt, who were utterly\ndisappointed; and they returned every one to their own country with shame.", "But Joseph took with him two thousand foot soldiers from the king,\nfor he desired he might have some assistance, in order to force such as\nwere refractory in the cities to pay.

And\nwhen he was at Askelon, and demanded the taxes of the people of Askelon,\nthey refused to pay any thing, and affronted him also; upon which he seized\nupon about twenty of the principal men, and slew them, and gathered what\nthey had together, and sent it all to the king, and informed him what he\nhad done.

By this means he gathered great wealth together, and made\nvast gains by this farming of the taxes; and he made use of what estate\nhe had thus gotten, in order to support his authority, as thinking it a\npiece of prudence to keep what had been the occasion and foundation of\nhis present good fortune; and this he did by the assistance of what he\nwas already possessed of, for he privately sent many presents to the king,\nand to Cleopatra, and to their friends, and to all that were powerful about\nthe court, and thereby purchased their good-will to himself.", "This good fortune he enjoyed for twenty-two years, and was become\nthe father of seven sons by one wife; he had also another son, whose name\nwas Hyrcanus, by his brother Solymius's daughter, whom he married on the\nfollowing occasion.

He then supped with\nthe king, and falling in love with an actress that was of great beauty,\nand came into the room where they feasted, he told his brother of it, and\nentreated him, because a Jew is forbidden by their law to come near to\na foreigner, to conceal his offense; and to be kind and subservient to\nhim, and to give him an opportunity of fulfilling his desires. Upon which\nhis brother willingly entertained the proposal of serving him, and adorned\nhis own daughter, and brought her to him by night, and put her into his\nbed. And Joseph, being disordered with drink, knew not who she was, and\nso lay with his brother's daughter; and this did he many times, and loved\nher exceedingly; and said to his brother, that he loved this actress so\nwell, that he should run the hazard of his life [if he must part with her],\nand yet probably the king would not give him leave [to take her with him].\nBut his brother bid him be in no concern about that matter, and told him\nhe might enjoy her whom he loved without any danger, and might have her\nfor his wife; and opened the truth of the matter to him, and assured him\nthat he chose rather to have his own daughter abused, than to overlook\nhim, and se him come to [public] disgrace. So Joseph commended him for\nthis his brotherly love, and married his daughter; and by her begat a son,\nwhose name was Hyrcanus, as we said before. And when this his youngest\nson showed, at thirteen years old, a mind that was both courageous and\nwise, and was greatly envied by his brethren, as being of a genius much\nabove them, and such a one as they might well envy, Joseph had once a mind\nto know which of his sons had the best disposition to virtue; and when\nhe sent them severally to those that had then the best reputation for instructing\nyouth, the rest of his children, by reason of their sloth and unwillingness\nto take pains, returned to him foolish and unlearned. After them he sent\nout the youngest, Hyrcanus, and gave him three hundred yoke of oxen, and\nbid him go two days' journey into the wilderness, and sow the land there,\nand yet kept back privately the yokes of the oxen that coupled them together.\nWhen Hyrcanus came to the place, and found he had no yokes with him, he\ncontenmed the drivers of the oxen, who advised him to send some to his\nfather, to bring them some yokes; but he thinking that he ought not to\nlose his time while they should be sent to bring him the yokes, he invented\na kind of stratagem, and what suited an age older than his own; for he\nslew ten yoke of the oxen, and distributed their flesh among the laborers,\nand cut their hides into several pieces, and made him yokes, and yoked\nthe oxen together with them; by which means he sowed as much land as his\nfather had appointed him to sow, and returned to him. And when he was come\nback, his father was mightily pleased with his sagacity, and commended\nthe sharpness of his understanding, and his boldness in what he did. And\nhe still loved him the more, as if he were his only genuine son, while\nhis brethren were much troubled at it.", "But when one told him that Ptolemy had a son just born, and that\nall the principal men of Syria, and the other countries subject to him,\nwere to keep a festival, on account of the child's birthday, and went away\nin haste with great retinues to Alexandria, he was himself indeed hindered\nfrom going by old age; but he made trial of his sons, whether any of them\nwould be willing to go to the king. And when the elder sons excused themselves\nfrom going, and said they were not courtiers good enough for such conversation,\nand advised him to send their brother Hyrcanus, he gladly hearkened to\nthat advice, and called Hyrcanus, and asked him whether he would go to\nthe king, and whether it was agreeable to him to go or not. And upon his\npromise that he would go, and his saying that he should not want much money\nfor his journey, because he would live moderately, and that ten thousand\ndrachmas would be sufficient, he was pleased with his son's prudence. After\na little while, the son advised his father not to send his presents to\nthe king from thence, but to give him a letter to his steward at Alexandria,\nthat he might furnish him with money, for purchasing what should be most\nexcellent and most precious. So he thinking that the expense of ten talents\nwould be enough for presents to be made the king, and commending his son,\nas giving him good advice, wrote to Arion his steward, that managed all\nhis money matters at Alexandria; which money was not less than three thousand\ntalents on his account, for Joseph sent the money he received in Syria\nto Alexandria. And when the day appointed for the payment of the taxes\nto the king came, he wrote to Arion to pay them. So when the son had asked\nhis father for a letter to the steward, and had received it, he made haste\nto Alexandria. And when he was gone, his brethren wrote to all the king's\nfriends, that they should destroy him.", "But when he was come to Alexaudria, he delivered his letter to Arion,\nwho asked him how many talents he would have (hoping he would ask for no\nmore than ten, or a little more); he said he wanted a thousand talents.\nAt which the steward was angry, and rebuked him, as one that intended to\nlive extravagantly; and he let him know how his father had gathered together\nhis estate by painstaking, and resisting his inclinations, and wished him\nto imitate the example of his father: he assured him withal, that he would\ngive him but ten talents, and that for a present to the king also. The\nson was irritated at this, and threw Arion into prison. But when Arion's\nwife had informed Cleopatra of this, with her entreaty, that she would\nrebuke the child for what he had done, (for Arion was in great esteem with\nher,) Cleopatra informed the king of it. And Ptolemy sent for Hyrcanus,\nand told him that he wondered, when he was sent to him by his father, that\nhe had not yet come into his presence, but had laid the steward in prison.\nAnd he gave order, therefore, that he should come to him, and give an account\nof the reason of what he had done. And they report that the answer he made\nto the king's messenger was this: That \"there was a law of his that\nforbade a child that was born to taste of the sacrifice, before he had\nbeen at the temple and sacrificed to God. According to which way of reasoning\nhe did not himself come to him in expectation of the present he was to\nmake to him, as to one who had been his father's benefactor; and that he\nhad punished the slave for disobeying his commands, for that it mattered\nnot Whether a master was little or great: so that unless we punish such\nas these, thou thyself mayst also expect to be despised by thy subjects.\"\nUpon hearing this his answer he fell a laughing, and wondered at the great\nsoul of the child.", "When Arion was apprized that this was the king's disposition, and\nthat he had no way to help himself, he gave the child a thousand talents,\nand was let out of prison. So after three days were over, Hyrcanus came\nand saluted the king and queen. They saw him with pleasure, and feasted\nhim in an obliging manner, out of the respect they bare to his father.\nSo he came to the merchants privately, and bought a hundred boys, that\nhad learning, and were in the flower of their ages, each at a talent apiece;\nas also he bought a hundred maidens, each at the same price as the other.\nAnd when he was invited to feast with the king among the principal men\nin the country, he sat down the lowest of them all, because he was little\nregarded, as a child in age still; and this by those who placed every one\naccording to their dignity. Now when all those that sat with him had laid\nthe bones Of the several parts on a heap before Hyrcanus, (for they had\nthemselves taken away the flesh belonging to them,) till the table where\nhe sat was filled full with them, Trypho, who was the king's jester, and\nwas appointed for jokes and laughter at festivals, was now asked by the\nguests that sat at the table [to expose him to laughter]. So he stood by\nthe king, and said, \"Dost thou not see, my lord, the bones that lie\nby Hyrcanus? by this similitude thou mayst conjecture that his father made\nall Syria as bare as he hath made these bones.\" And the king laughing\nat what Trypho said, and asking of Hyrcanus, How he came to have so many\nbones before him? he replied,\" Very rightfully, my lord; for they\nare dogs that eat the flesh and the bones together, as these thy guests\nhave done, (looking in the mean time at those guests,) for there is nothing\nbefore them; but they are men that eat the flesh, and cast away the hones,\nas I, who am also a man, have now done.\" Upon which the king admired\nat his answer, which was so wisely made; and bid them all make an acclamation,\nas a mark of their approbation of his jest, which was truly a facetious\none. On the next day Hyrcanus went to every one of the king's friends,\nand of the men powerful at court, and saluted them; but still inquired\nof the servants what present they would make the king on his son's birthday;\nand when some said that they would give twelve talents, and that others\nof greater dignity would every one give according to the quantity of their\nriches, he pretended to every one of them to be grieved that he was not\nable to bring so large a present; for that he had no more than five talents.\nAnd when the servants heard what he said, they told their masters; and\nthey rejoiced in the prospect that Joseph would be disapproved, and would\nmake the king angry, by the smallness of his present. When the day came,\nthe others, even those that brought the most, offered the king not above\ntwenty talents; but Hyrcanus gave to every one of the hundred boys and\nhundred maidens that he had bought a talent apiece, for them to carry,\nand introduced them, the boys to the king, and the maidens to Cleopatra;\nevery body wondering at the unexpected richness of the presents, even the\nking and queen themselves. He also presented those that attended about\nthe king with gifts to the value of a great number of talents, that he\nmight escape the danger he was in from them; for to these it was that Hyrcanus's\nbrethren had written to destroy him. Now Ptolemy admired at the young man's\nmagnanimity, and commanded him to ask what gift he pleased. But he desired\nnothing else to be done for him by the king than to write to his father\nand brethren about him. So when the king had paid him very great respects,\nand had given him very large gifts, and had written to his father and his\nbrethren, and all his commanders and officers, about him, he sent him away.\nBut when his brethren heard that Hyrcanus had received such favors from\nthe king, and was returning home with great honor, they went out to meet\nhim, and to destroy him, and that with the privity of their father; for\nhe was angry at him for the [large] sum of money that he bestowed for presents,\nand so had no concern for his preservation. However, Joseph concealed the\nanger he had at his son, out of fear of the king. And when Hyrcanus's brethren\ncame to fight him, he slew many others of those that were with them, as\nalso two of his brethren themselves; but the rest of them escaped to Jerusalem\nto their father. But when Hyrcanus came to the city, where nobody would\nreceive him, he was afraid for himself, and retired beyond the river Jordan,\nand there abode, but obliging the barbarians to pay their taxes.", {"text": {"body": {"opener": "Areus, King of the Lacedemonians, to Onias, sendeth\ngreeting.", "p": {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Whence it comes that these Lacedemonians declare themselves here to be\nof kin to the Jews, as derived from the same ancestor, Abraham, I cannot\ntell, unless, as Grotius supposes, they were derived from Dores, that came\nof the Pelasgi.

There were about a thousand,\nwith their wives and children, who were smothered and died in these caves;\nbut many of those that escaped joined themselves to Mattathias, and appointed\nhim to be their ruler, who taught them to fight, even on the sabbath day;\nand told them that unless they would do so, they would become their own\nenemies, by observing the law [so rigorously], while their adversaries\nwould still assault them on this day, and they would not then defend themselves,\nand that nothing could then hinder but they must all perish without fighting.\nThis speech persuaded them. And this rule continues among us to this day,\nthat if there be a necessity, we may fight on sabbath days. So Mattathias\ngot a great army about him, and overthrew their idol altars, and slew those\nthat broke the laws, even all that he could get under his power; for many\nof them were dispersed among the nations round about them for fear of him.\nHe also commanded that those boys which were not yet circumcised should\nbe circumcised now; and he drove those away that were appointed to hinder\nsuch their circumcision.", "But when he had ruled one year, and was fallen into a distemper,\nhe called for his sons, and set them round about him, and said, \"O\nmy sons, I am going the way of all the earth; and I recommend to you my\nresolution, and beseech you not to be negligent in keeping it, but to be\nmindful of the desires of him who begat you, and brought you up, and to\npreserve the customs of your country, and to recover your ancient form\nof government, which is in danger of being overturned, and not to be carried\naway with those that, either by their own inclination, or out of necessity,\nbetray it, but to become such sons as are worthy of me; to be above all\nforce and necessity, and so to dispose your souls, as to be ready, when\nit shall be necessary, to die for your laws; as sensible of this, by just\nreasoning, that if God see that you are so disposed he will not overlook\nyou, but will have a great value for your virtue, and will restore to you\nagain what you have lost, and will return to you that freedom in which\nyou shall live quietly, and enjoy your own customs. Your bodies are mortal,\nand subject to fate; but they receive a sort of immortality, by the remembrance\nof what actions they have done. And I would have you so in love with this\nimmortality, that you may pursue after glory, and that, when you have undergone\nthe greatest difficulties, you may not scruple, for such things, to lose\nyour lives. I exhort you, especially, to agree one with another; and in\nwhat excellency any one of you exceeds another, to yield to him so far,\nand by that means to reap the advantage of every one's own virtues. Do\nyou then esteem Simon as your father, because he is a man of extraordinary\nprudence, and be governed by him in what counsels be gives you. Take Maccabeus\nfor the general of your army, because of his courage and strength, for\nhe will avenge your nation, and will bring vengeance on your enemies. Admit\namong you the righteous and religious, and augment their power.\"", "When Mattathias had thus discoursed to his sons, and had prayed to\nGod to be their assistant, and to recover to the people their former constitution,\nhe died a little afterward, and was buried at Modin; all the people making\ngreat lamentation for him. Whereupon his son Judas took upon him the administration\nof public affairs, in the hundred fbrty and sixth year; and thus, by the\nready assistance of his brethren, and of others, Judas cast their enemies\nout of the country, and put those of their own country to death who had\ntransgressed its laws, and purified the land of all the pollutions that\nwere in it.", "WHEN Apollonius, the general of the Samaritan forces, heard this,\nhe took his army, and made haste to go against Judas, who met him, and\njoined battle with him, and beat him, and slew many of his men, and among\nthem Apollonius himself, their general, whose sword being that which he\nhappened then to wear, he seized upon, and kept for himself; but he wounded\nmore than he slew, and took a great deal of prey from the enemy's camp,\nand went his way. But when Seron, who was general of the army of Celesyria,\nheard that many had joined themselves to Judas, and that he had about him\nan army sufficient for fighting, and for making war, he determined to make\nan expedition against him, as thinking it became him to endeavor to punish\nthose that transgressed the king's injunctions. He then got together an\narmy, as large as he was able, and joined to it the runagate and wicked\nJews, and came against Judas. He came as far as Bethhoron, a village of\nJudea, and there pitched his camp; upon which Judas met him; and when he\nintended to give him battle, he saw that his soldiers were backward to\nfight, because their number was small, and because they wanted food, for\nthey were fasting, he encouraged them, and said to them, that victory and\nconquest of enemies are not derived from the multitude in armies, but in\nthe exercise of piety towards God; and that they had the plainest instances\nin their forefathers, who, by their righteousness, exerting themselves\non behalf of their own laws, and their own children, had frequently conquered\nmany ten thousands, - for innocence is the strongest army. By this speech\nhe induced his men to contenm the multitude of the enemy, and to fall upon\nSeron. And upon joining battle with him, he beat the Syrians; and when\ntheir general fell among the rest, they all ran away with speed, as thinking\nthat to be their best way of escaping. So he pursued them unto the plain,\nand slew about eight hundred of the enemy; but the rest escaped to the\nregion which lay near to the sea.", "When king Antiochus heard of these things, he was very angry at what\nhad happened; so he got together all his own army, with many mercenaries,\nwhom he had hired from the islands, and took them with him, and prepared\nto break into Judea about the beginning of the spring. But when, upon his\nmustering his soldiers, he perceived that his treasures were deficient,\nand there was a want of money in them, for all the taxes were not paid,\nby reason of the seditions there had been among the nations he having been\nso magnanimous and so liberal, that what he had was not sufficient for\nhim, he therefore resolved first to go into Persia, and collect the taxes\nof that country. Hereupon he left one whose name was Lysias, who was in\ngreat repute with him governor of the kingdom, as far as the bounds of\nEgypt, and of the Lower Asia, and reaching from the river Euphrates, and\ncommitted to him a certain part of his forces, and of his elephants, and\ncharged him to bring up his son Antiochus with all possible care, until\nhe came back; and that he should conquer Judea, and take its inhabitants\nfor slaves, and utterly destroy Jerusalem, and abolish the whole nation.\nAnd when king Antiochus had given these things in charge to Lysias, he\nwent into Persia; and in the hundred and forty-seventh year he passed over\nEuphrates, and went to the superior provinces.", "Upon this Lysias chose Ptolemy, the son of Dorymenes, and Nicanor,\nand Gorgias, very potent men among the king's friends, and delivered to\nthem forty thousand foot soldiers, and seven thousand horsemen, and sent\nthem against Judea, who came as far as the city Emmaus, and pitched their\ncamp in the plain country. There came also to them auxiliaries out of Syria,\nand the country round about; as also many of the runagate Jews. And besides\nthese came some merchants to buy those that should be carried captives,\n(having bonds with them to bind those that should be made prisoners,) with\nthat silver and gold which they were to pay for their price. And when Judas\nsaw their camp, and how numerous their enemies were, he persuaded his own\nsoldiers to be of good courage, and exhorted them to place their hopes\nof victory in God, and to make supplication to him, according to the custom\nof their country, clothed in sackcloth; and to show what was their usual\nhabit of supplication in the greatest dangers, and thereby to prevail with\nGod to grant you the victory over your enemies. So he set them in their\nancient order of battle used by their forefathers, under their captains\nof thousands, and other officers, and dismissed such as were newly married,\nas well as those that had newly gained possessions, that they might not\nfight in a cowardly manner, out of an inordinate love of life, in order\nto enjoy those blessings. When he had thus disposed his soldiers, he encouraged\nthem to fight by the following speech, which he made to them: \"O my\nfellow soldiers, no other time remains more opportune than the present\nfor courage and contempt of dangers; for if you now fight manfully, you\nmay recover your liberty, which, as it is a thing of itself agreeable to\nall men, so it proves to be to us much more desirable, by its affording\nus the liberty of worshipping God. Since therefore you are in such circumstances\nat present, you must either recover that liberty, and so regain a happy\nand blessed way of living, which is that according to our laws, and the\ncustoms of our country, or to submit to the most opprobrious sufferings;\nnor will any seed of your nation remain if you be beat in this battle.\nFight therefore manfully; and suppose that you must die, though you do\nnot fight; but believe, that besides such glorious rewards as those of\nthe liberty of your country, of your laws, of your religion, you shall\nthen obtain everlasting glory. Prepare yourselves, therefore, and put yourselves\ninto such an agreeable posture, that you may be ready to fight with the\nenemy as soon as it is day tomorrow morning.\"", "And this was the speech which Judas made to encourage them. But when\nthe enemy sent Gorgias, with five thousand foot and one thousand horse,\nthat he might fall upon Judas by night, and had for that purpose certain\nof the runagate Jews as guides, the son of Mattathias perceived it, and\nresolved to fall upon those enemies that were in their camp, now their\nforces were divided. When they had therefore supped in good time, and had\nleft many fires in their camp, he marched all night to those enemies that\nwere at Emmaus. So that when Gorgias found no enemy in their camp, but\nsuspected that they were retired, and had hidden themselves among the mountains,\nhe resolved to go and seek them wheresoever they were. But about break\nof day Judas appeared to those enemies that were at Emmaus, with only three\nthousand men, and those ill armed, by reason of their poverty; and when\nhe saw the enemy very well and skillfully fortified in their camp, he encouraged\nthe Jews, and told them that they ought to fight, though it were with their\nnaked bodies, for that God had sometimes of old given such men strength,\nand that against such as were more in number, and were armed also, out\nof regard to their great courage. So he commanded the trumpeters to sound\nfor the battle; and by thus falling upon the enemies when they did not\nexpect it, and thereby astonishing and disturbing their minds, he slew\nmany of those that resisted him, and went on pursuing the rest as far as\nGadara, and the plains of Idumea, and Ashdod, and Jamnia; and of these\nthere fell about three thousand. Yet did Judas exhort his soldiers not\nto be too desirous of the spoils, for that still they must have a contest\nand battle with Gorgias, and the forces that were with him; but that when\nthey had once overcome them, then they might securely plunder the camp,\nbecause they were the only enemies remaining, and they expected no others.\nAnd just as he was speaking to his soldiers, Gorgias's men looked down\ninto that army which they left in their camp, and saw that it was overthrown,\nand the camp burnt; for the smoke that arose from it showed them, even\nwhen they were a great way off, what had happened. When therefore those\nthat were with Gorgias understood that things were in this posture, and\nperceived that those that were with Judas were ready to fight them, they\nalso were affrighted, and put to flight; but then Judas, as though he had\nalready beaten Gorgias's soldiers without fighting, returned and seized\non the spoils. He took a great quantity of gold, and silver, and purple,\nand blue, and then returned home with joy, and singing hymns to God for\ntheir good success; for this victory greatly contributed to the recovery\nof their liberty.", "Hereupon Lysias was confounded at the defeat of the army which he\nhad sent, and the next year he got together sixty thousand chosen men.\nHe also took five thousand horsemen, and fell upon Judea; and he went up\nto the hill country of Bethsur, a village of Judea, and pitched his camp\nthere, where Judas met him with ten thousand men; and when he saw the great\nnumber of his enemies, he prayed to God that he would assist him, and joined\nbattle with the first of the enemy that appeared, and beat them, and slew\nabout five thousand of them, and thereby became terrible to the rest of\nthem. Nay, indeed, Lysias observing the great spirit of the Jews, how they\nwere prepared to die rather than lose their liberty, and being afraid of\ntheir desperate way of fighting, as if it were real strength, he took the\nrest of the army back with him, and returned to Antioch, where he listed\nforeigners into the service, and prepared to fall upon Judea with a greater\narmy.", "When therefore the generals of Antiochus's armies had been beaten\nso often, Judas assembled the people together, and told them, that after\nthese many victories which God had given them, they ought to go up to Jerusalem,\nand purify the temple, and offer the appointed sacrifices. But as soon\nas he, with the whole multitude, was come to Jerusalem, and found the temple\ndeserted, and its gates burnt down, and plants growing in the temple of\ntheir own accord, on account of its desertion, he and those that were with\nhim began to lament, and were quite confounded at the sight of the temple;\nso he chose out some of his soldiers, and gave them order to fight against\nthose guards that were in the citadel, until he should have purified the\ntemple. When therefore he had carefully purged it, and had brought in new\nvessels, the candlestick, the table [of shew-bread], and the altar [of\nincense], which were made of gold, he hung up the veils at the gates, and\nadded doors to them. He also took down the altar [of burnt-offering], and\nbuilt a new one of stones that he gathered together, and not of such as\nwere hewn with iron tools. So on the five and twentieth day of the month\nCasleu, which the Macedonians call Apeliens, they lighted the lamps that\nwere on the candlestick, and offered incense upon the altar [of incense],\nand laid the loaves upon the table [of shew-bread], and offered burnt-offerings\nupon the new altar [of burnt-offering]. Now it so fell out, that these\nthings were done on the very same day on which their Divine worship had\nfallen off, and was reduced to a profane and common use, after three years'\ntime; for so it was, that the temple was made desolate by Antiochus, and\nso continued for three years. This desolation happened to the temple in\nthe hundred forty and fifth year, on the twenty-fifth day of the month\nApeliens, and on the hundred fifty and third olympiad: but it was dedicated\nanew, on the same day, the twenty-fifth of the month Apeliens, on the hundred\nand forty-eighth year, and on the hundred and fifty-fourth olympiad. And\nthis desolation came to pass according to the prophecy of Daniel, which\nwas given four hundred and eight years before; for he declared that the\nMacedonians would dissolve that worship [for some time].", "Now Judas celebrated the festival of the restoration of the sacrifices\nof the temple for eight days, and omitted no sort of pleasures thereon;\nbut he feasted them upon very rich and splendid sacrifices; and he honored\nGod, and delighted them by hymns and psalms. Nay, they were so very glad\nat the revival of their customs, when, after a long time of intermission,\nthey unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship, that they\nmade it a law for their posterity, that they should keep a festival, on\naccount of the restoration of their temple worship, for eight days. And\nfrom that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it Lights.\nI suppose the reason was, because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared\nto us; and that thence was the name given to that festival. Judas also\nrebuilt the walls round about the city, and reared towers of great height\nagainst the incursions of enemies, and set guards therein. He also fortified\nthe city Bethsura, that it might serve as a citadel against any distresses\nthat might come from our enemies.", "WHEN these things were over, the nations round about the Jews were\nvery uneasy at the revival of their power, and rose up together, and destroyed\nmany of them, as gaining advantage over them by laying snares for them,\nand making secret conspiracies against them. Judas made perpetual expeditions\nagainst these men, and endeavored to restrain them from those incursions,\nand to prevent the mischiefs they did to the Jews. So he fell upon the\nIdumeans, the posterity of Esau, at Acrabattene, and slew a great many\nof them, and took their spoils. He also shut up the sons of Bean, that\nlaid wait for the Jews; and he sat down about them, and besieged them,\nand burnt their towers, and destroyed the men [that were in them]. After\nthis he went thence in haste against the Ammonites, who had a great and\na numerous army, of which Timotheus was the commander. And when he had\nsubdued them, he seized on the city Jazer, and took their wives and their\nchildren captives, and burnt the city, and then returned into Judea. But\nwhen the neighboring nations understood that he was returned, they got\ntogether in great numbers in the land of Gilead, and came against those\nJews that were at their borders, who then fled to the garrison of Dathema;\nand sent to Judas, to inform him that Timotheus was endeavoring to take\nthe place whither they were fled. And as these epistles were reading, there\ncame other messengers out of Galilee, who informed him that the inhabitants\nof Ptolemais, and of Tyre and Sidon, and strangers of Galilee, were gotten\ntogether.", "Accordingly Judas, upon considering what was fit to be done, with\nrelation to the necessity both these cases required, gave order that Simon\nhis brother should take three thousand chosen men, and go to the assistance\nof the Jews in Galilee, while he and another of his brothers, Jonathan,\nmade haste into the land of Gilead, with eight thousand soldiers. And he\nleft Joseph, the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, to be over the rest of\nthe forces; and charged them to keep Judea very carefully, and to fight\nno battles with any persons whomsoever until his return. Accordingly, Simon-went\ninto Galilee, and fought the enemy, and put them to flight, and pursued\nthem to the very gates of Ptolemais, and slew about three thousand of them,\nand took the spoils of those that were slain, and those Jews whom they\nhad made captives, with their baggage, and then returned home.", "Now as for Judas Maccabeus, and his brother Jonathan, they passed\nover the river Jordan; and when they had gone three days journey, they\nlighted upon the Nabateans, who came to meet them peaceably, and who told\nthem how the affairs of those in the land of Gilead stood; and how many\nof them were in distress, and driven into garrisons, and into the cities\nof Galilee; and exhorted him to make haste to go against the foreigners,\nand to endeavor to save his own countrymen out of their hands. To this\nexhortation Judas hearkened, and returned to the wilderness; and in the\nfirst place fell upon the inhabitants of Bosor, and took the city, and\nbeat the inhabitants, and destroyed all the males, and all that were able\nto fight, and burnt the city. Nor did he stop even when night came on,\nbut he journeyed in it to the garrison where the Jews happened to be then\nshut up, and where Timotheus lay round the place with his army. And Judas\ncame upon the city in the morning; and when he found that the enemy were\nmaking an assault upon the walls, and that some of them brought ladders,\non which they might get upon those walls, and that others brought engines\n[to batter them], he bid the trumpeter to sound his trumpet, and he encouraged\nhis soldiers cheerfully to undergo dangers for the sake of their brethren\nand kindred; he also parted his army into three bodies, and fell upon the\nbacks of their enemies. But when Timotheus's men perceived that it was\nMaccabeus that was upon them, of both whose courage and good success in\nwar they had formerly had sufficient experience, they were put to flight;\nbut Judas followed them with his army, and slew about eight thousand of\nthem. He then turned aside to a city of the foreigners called Malle, and\ntook it, and slew all the males, and burnt the city itself. He then removed\nfrom thence, and overthrew Casphom and Bosor, and many other cities of\nthe land of Gilead.", "But not long after this, Timotheus prepared a great army, and took\nmany others as auxiliaries; and induced some of the Arabians, by the promise\nof rewards, to go with him in this expedition, and came with his army beyond\nthe brook, over against the city Raphon; and he encouraged his soldiers,\nif it came to a battle with the Jews, to fight courageously, and to hinder\ntheir passing over the brook; for he said to them beforehand, that \"if\nthey come over it, we shall be beaten.\" And when Judas heard that\nTimotheus prepared himself to fight, he took all his own army, and went\nin haste against Timotheus his enemy; and when he had passed over the brook,\nhe fell upon his enemies, and some of them met him, whom he slew, and others\nof them he so terrified, that he compelled them to throw down their arms\nand fly; and some of them escaped, but some of them fled to what was called\nthe Temple of Camaim, and hoped thereby to preserve themselves; but Judas\ntook the city, and slew them, and burnt the temple, and so used several\nways of destroying his enemies.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The reason why Bethshah was called Scythopolis is well known from Herodotus,\nB.

And when\nthe inhabitants of Ephron would not agree to this proposal, he encouraged\nthose that were with him, and encompassed the city round, and besieged\nit, and, lying round it by day and night, took the city, and slew every\nmale in it, and burnt it all down, and so obtained a way through it; and\nthe multitude of those that were slain was so great, that they went over\nthe dead bodies. So they came over Jordan, and arrived at the great plain,\nover against which is situate the city Bethshah, which is called by the\nGreeks Scythopolis. \nAnd going away hastily from thence, they came into Judea, singing psalms\nand hymns as they went, and indulging such tokens of mirth as are usual\nin triumphs upon victory.

And being incited by these motives, he went\nin haste to Elymais, and assaulted it, and besieged it. But as those that\nwere in it were not terrified at his assault, nor at his siege, but opposed\nhim very courageously, he was beaten off his hopes; for they drove him\naway from the city, and went out and pursued after him, insomuch that he\nfled away as far as Babylon, and lost a great many of his army. And when\nhe was grieving for this disappointment, some persons told him of the defeat\nof his commanders whom he had left behind him to fight against Judea, and\nwhat strength the Jews had already gotten.

Whence one may wonder at Polybius of Megalopolis,\nwho, though otherwise a good man, yet saith that \"Antiochus died because\nhe had a purpose to plunder the temple of Diana in Persia;\" for the\npurposing to do a thing, \nbut not actually doing it, is not worthy of punishment.

When these misfortunes\nhad often happened to them, Judas resolved to destroy that garrison; whereupon\nhe got all the people together, and vigorously besieged those that were\nin the citadel. This was in the hundred and fiftieth year of the dominion\nof the Seleucidse. So he made engines of war, and erected bulwarks, and\nvery zealously pressed on to take the citadel. But there were not a few\nof the runagates who were in the place that went out by night into the\ncountry, and got together some other wicked men like themselves, and went\nto Antiochus the king, and desired of him that he would not suffer them\nto be neglected, under the great hardships that lay upon them from those\nof their own nation; and this because their sufferings were occasioned\non his father's account, while they left the religious worship of their\nfathers, and preferred that which he had commanded them to follow: that\nthere was danger lest the citadel, and those appointed to garrison it by\nthe king, should be taken by Judas, and those that were with him, unless\nhe would send them succors. When Antiochus, who was but a child, heard\nthis, he was angry, and sent for his captains and his friends, and gave\norder that they should get an army of mercenaries together, with such men\nalso of his own kingdom as were of an age fit for war. Accordingly, an\narmy was collected of about a hundred thousand footmen, and twenty thousand\nhorsemen, and thirty-two elephants.", "So the king took this army, and marched hastily out of Antioch, with\nLysias, who had the command of the whole, and came to Idumea, and thence\nwent up to the city Bethsnra, a city that was strong, and not to be taken\nwithout great difficulty.

But when Judas heard of the king's coming, he raised the\nsiege of the citadel, and met the king, and pitched his camp in certain\nstraits, at a place called Bethzachriah, at the distance of seventy furlongs\nfrom the enemy; but the king soon drew his forces from Bethsura, and brought\nthem to those straits. And as soon as it was day, he put his men in battle-array,\nand made his elephants follow one another through the narrow passes, because\nthey could not be set sideways by one another. Now round about every elephant\nthere were a thousand footmen, and five hundred horsemen. The elephants\nalso had high towers [upon their backs], and archers [in them]. And he\nalso made the rest of his army to go up the mountains, and put his friends\nbefore the rest; and gave orders for the army to shout aloud, and so he\nattacked the enemy. He also exposed to sight their golden and brazen shields,\nso that a glorious splendor was sent from them; and when they shouted the\nmountains echoed again. When Judas saw this, he was not terrified, but\nreceived the enemy with great courage, and slew about six hundred of the\nfirst ranks. But when his brother Eleazar, whom they called Auran, saw\nthe tallest of all the elephants armed with royal breastplates, and supposed\nthat the king was upon him, he attacked him with great quickness and bravery.\nHe also slew many of those that were about the elephant, and scattered\nthe rest, and then went under the belly of the elephant, and smote him,\nand slew him; so the elephant fell upon Eleazar, and by his weight crushed\nhim to death. And thus did this man come to his end, when he had first\ncourageously destroyed manyof his enemies.", "But Judas, seeing the strength of the enemy, retired to Jerusalem,\nand prepared to endure a siege. As for Antiochus, he sent part of his army\nto Bethsura, to besiege it, and with the rest of his army he came against\nJerusalem; but the inhabitants of Bethsura were terrified at his strength;\nand seeing that their provisions grew scarce,. they delivered themselves\nup on the security of oaths that they should suffer no hard treatment from\nthe king. And when Antiochus had thus taken the city, he did them no other\nharm than sending them out naked. He also placed a garrison of his own\nin the city. But as for the temple of Jerusalem, he lay at its siege a\nlong time, while they within bravely defended it; for what engines soever\nthe king set against them, they set other engines again to oppose them.\nBut then their provisions failed them; what fruits of the ground they had\nlaid up were spent and the land being not ploughed that year, continued\nunsowed, because it was the seventh year, on which, by our laws, we are\nobliged to let it lay uncultivated. And withal, so many of the besieged\nran away for want of necessaries, that but a few only were left in the\ntemple.", "And these happened to be the circumstances of such as were besieged\nin the temple. But then, because Lysias, the general of the army, and Antiochus\nthe king, were informed that Philip was coming upon them out of Persia,\nand was endeavoring to get the management of public affairs to himself,\nthey came into these sentiments, to leave the siege, and to make haste\nto go against Philip; yet did they resolve not to let this be known to\nthe soldiers or to the officers: but the king commanded Lysias to speak\nopenly to the soldiers and the officers, without saying a word about the\nbusiness of Philip; and to intimate to them that the siege would be very\nlong; that the place was very strong; that they were already in want of\nprovisions; that many affairs of the kingdom wanted regulation; and that\nit was much better to make a league with the besieged, and to become friends\nto their whole nation, by permitting them to observe the laws of their\nfathers, while they broke out into this war only because they were deprived\nof them, and so to depart home. When Lysias had discoursed thus to them,\nboth the army and the officers were pleased with this resolution.", "Accordingly the king sent to Judas, and to those that were besieged\nwith them, and promised to give them peace, and to permit them to make\nuse of, and live according to, the laws of their fathers; and they gladly\nreceived his proposals; and when they had gained security upon oath for\ntheir performance, they went out of the temple. But when Antiochus came\ninto it, and saw how strong the place was, he broke his oaths, and ordered\nhis army that was there to pluck down the walls to the ground; and when\nhe had so done, he returned to Antioch. He also carried with him Onias\nthe high priest, who was also called Menelaus; for Lysias advised the king\nto slay Menelaus, if he would have the Jews be quiet, and cause him no\nfurther disturbance, for that this man was the origin of all the mischief\nthe Jews had done them, by persuading his father to compel the Jews to\nleave the religion of their fathers. So the king sent Menelaus to Berea,\na city of Syria, and there had him put to death, when he had been high\npriest ten years. He had been a wicked and an impious man; and, in order\nto get the government to himself, had compelled his nation to transgress\ntheir own laws. After the death of Menelaus, Alcimus, who was also called\nJacimus, was made high priest. But when king Antiochus found that Philip\nhad already possessed himself of the government, he made war against him,\nand subdued him, and took him, and slew him. Now as to Onias, the son of\nthe high priest, who, as we before informed you, was left a child when\nhis father died, when he saw that the king had slain his uncle Menelaus,\nand given the high priesthood to Alcimus, who was not of the high priest\nstock, but was induced by Lysias to translate that dignity from his family\nto another house, he fled to Ptolemy, king of Egypt; and when he found\nhe was in great esteem with him, and with his wife Cleopatra, he desired\nand obtained a place in the Nomus of Heliopolis, wherein he built a temple\nlike to that at Jerusalem; of which therefore we shall hereafter give an\naccount, in a place more proper for it.", "ABOUT the same time Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, fled away from\nRome, and took Tripoli, a city of Syria, and set the diadem on his own\nhead. He also gathered certain mercenary soldiers together, and entered\ninto his kingdom, and was joyfully received by all, who delivered themselves\nup to him. And when they had taken Autiochus the king, and Lysias, they\nbrought them to him alive; both which were immediately put to death by\nthe command of Demetrius, when Antiochus had reigned two years, as we have\nalready elsewhere related. But there were now many of the wicked Jewish\nrunagates that came together to him, and with them Alcimus the high priest,\nwho accused the whole nation, and particularly Judas and his brethren;\nand said that they had slain all his friends, and that those in his kingdom\nthat were of his party, and waited for his return, were by them put to\ndeath; that these men had ejected them out of their own country, and caused\nthem to be sojourners in a foreign land; and they desired that he would\nsend some one of his own friends, and know from him what mischief Judas's\nparty had done.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "It is no way probable that Josephus would call Bacchidoa, that bitter and\nbloody enemy of the Jews, as our present copies have it, a man good, or\nkind, and gentle, What the author of the First Book of Maccabees, whom\nJosephus here follows, instead of that character, says of him, is, that\nhe was a great man in the kingdom, and faithful to his king; which was\nvery probably Josephus's meaning also."}, "#text": "At this Demetrius was very angry, and sent Bacchides, a friend of\nAntiochus Epiphanes, \na good man, and one that had been intrusted with all Mesopotamia, and gave\nhim an army, and committed Alcimus the high priest to his care; and gave\nhim charge to slay Judas, and those that were with him. So Bacchides made\nhaste, and went out of Antioch with his army; and when he was come into\nJudea, he sent to Judas and his brethren, to discourse with them about\na league of friendship and peace, for he had a mind to take him by treachery.\nBut Judas did not give credit to him, for he saw that he came with so great\nan army as men do not bring when they come to make peace, but to make war.\nHowever, some of the people acquiesced in what Bacchides caused to be proclaimed;\nand supposing they should undergo no considerable harm from Alcimus, who\nwas their countryman, they went over to them; and when they had received\noaths from both of them, that neither they themselves, nor those of the\nsame sentiments, should come to any harm, they intrusted themselves with\nthem. But Bacchides troubled not himself about the oaths he had taken,\nbut slew threescore of them, although, by not keeping his faith with those\nthat first went over, he deterred all the rest, who had intentions to go\nover to him, from doing it. But as he was gone out of Jerusalem, and was\nat the village called Bethzetho, he sent out, and caught many of the deserters,\nand some of the people also, and slew them all; and enjoined all that lived\nin the country to submit to Alcimus.

With these, whom he used as his servants and soldiers,\nhe went all over the country, and slew all that he could find of Judas's\nparty. But when Judas saw that Alcimus was already become great, and had\ndestroyed many of the good and holy men of the country, he also went all\nover the country, and destroyed those that were of the other party. But\nwhen Alcimus saw that he was not able to oppose Judas, nor was equal to\nhim in strength, he resolved to apply himself to king Demetrius for his\nassistance; so he came to Antioch, and irritated him against Judas, and\naccused him, alleging that he had undergone a great many miseries by his\nmeans, and that he would do more mischief unless he were prevented, and\nbrought to punishment, which must be done by sending a powerful force against\nhim.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Josephus's copies must have been corrupted when they here give victory\nto Nicanor, contrary to the words following, which imply that he who was\nbeaten fled into the citadel, which for certain belonged to the city of\nDavid, or to Mount Zion, and was in the possession of Nicanor's garrison,\nand not of Judas's.

When Nicanor had delivered this message, Judas and his brethren\ncomplied with him, and suspecting no deceit, they gave him assurances of\nfriendship, and received Nicanor and his army; but while he was saluting\nJudas, and they were talking together, he gave a certain signal to his\nown soldiers, upon which they were to seize upon Judas; but he perceived\nthe treachery, and ran back to his own soldiers, and fled away with them.\nSo upon this discovery of his purpose, and of the snares laid for Judas,\nNicanor determined to make open war with him, and gathered his army together,\nand prepared for fighting him; and upon joining battle with him at a certain\nvillage called Capharsalama, he beat Judas, \nand forced him to fly to that citadel which was at Jerusalem."}, "And when Nicanor came down from the citadel unto the temple, some\nof the priests and elders met him, and saluted him; and showed him the\nsacrifices which they offered to God for the king: upon which he blasphemed,\nand threatened them, that unless the people would deliver up Judas to him,\nupon his return he would pull clown their temple.

nation of the Jews recovered their freedom when\nthey had been brought into slavery by the Macedonians, and what struggles,\nand how great battles, Judas, the general of their army, ran through, till\nhe was slain as he was fighting for them, hath been related in the foregoing\nbook; but after he was dead, all the wicked, and those that transgressed\nthe laws of their forefathers, sprang up again in Judea, and grew upon\nthem, and distressed them on every side. A famine also assisted their wickedness,\nand afflicted the country, till not a few, who by reason of their want\nof necessaries, and because they were not able to bear up against the miseries\nthat both the famine and their enemies brought upon them, deserted their\ncountry, and went to the Macedonians. And now Bacchides gathered those\nJews together who had apostatized from the accustomed way of living of\ntheir forefathers, and chose to live like their neighbors, and committed\nthe care of the country to them, who also caught the friends of Judas,\nand those of his party, and delivered them up to Bacchides, who when he\nhad, in the first place, tortured and tormented them at his pleasure, he,\nby that means, at length killed them. And when this calamity of the Jews\nwas become so great, as they had never had experience of the like since\ntheir return out of Babylon, those that remained of the companions of Judas,\nseeing that the nation was ready to be destroyed after a miserable manner,\ncame to his brother Jonathan, and desired him that he would imitate his\nbrother, and that care which he took of his countrymen, for whose liberty\nin general he died also; and that he would not permit the nation to be\nwithout a governor, especially in those destructive circumstances wherein\nit now was. And where Jonathan said that he was ready to die for them,\nand esteemed no inferior to his brother, he was appointed to be the general\nof the Jewish army.", "When Bacchides heard this, and was afraid that Jonathan might be\nvery troublesome to the king and the Macedonians, as Judas had been before\nhim, he sought how he might slay him by treachery. But this intention of\nhis was not unknown to Jonathan, nor to his brother Simon; but when these\ntwo were apprized of it, they took all their companions, and presently\nfled into that wilderness which was nearest to the city; and when they\nwere come to a lake called Asphar, they abode there. But when Bacchides\nwas sensible that they were in a low state, and were in that place, he\nhasted to fall upon them with all his forces, and pitching his camp beyond\nJordan, he recruited his army. But when Jonathan knew that Bacchides Was\ncoming upon him, he sent his brother John, who was also called Gaddis,\nto the Nabatean Arabs, that he might lodge his baggage with them until\nthe battle with Bacchides should be over, for they were the Jews' friends.\nAnd the sons of Ambri laid an ambush for John from the city Medaba, and\nseized upon him, and upon those that were with him, and plundered all that\nthey had with them. They also slew John, and all his companions. However,\nthey were sufficiently punished for what they now did by John's brethren,\nas we shall relate presently.", "But when Bacchides knew that Jonathan had pitched his camp among\nthe lakes of Jordan, he observed when their sabbath day came, and then\nassaulted him, [as supposing that he would not fight because of the law\nfor resting on that day]: but he exhorted his companions [to fight]; and\ntold them that their lives were at stake, since they were encompassed by\nthe river, and by their enemies, and had no way to escape, for that their\nenemies pressed upon them from before, and the river was behind them. So\nafter he had prayed to God to give them the victory, he joined battle with\nthe enemy, of whom he overthrew many; and as he saw Bacchides coming up\nboldly to him, he stretched out his right hand to smite him; but the other\nforeseeing and avoiding the stroke, Jonathan with his companions leaped\ninto the river, and swam over it, and by that means escaped beyond Jordan\nwhile the enemies did not pass over that river; but Bacchides returned\npresently to the citadel at Jerusalem, having lost about two thousand of\nhis army. He also fortified many cities of Judea, whose walls had been\ndemolished; Jericho, and Emmaus, and Betboron, and Bethel, and Tinma, and\nPharatho, and Tecoa, and Gazara, and built towers in every one of these\ncities, and encompassed them with strong walls, that were very large also,\nand put garrisons into them, that they might issue out of them, and do\nmischief to the Jews. He also fortified the citadel at Jerusalem more than\nall the rest. Moreover, he took the sons of the principal Jews as pledges,\nand hut them up in the citadel, and in that manner guarded it.", "About the same time one came to Jonathan, and to his brother Simon,\nand told them that the sons of Ambri were celebrating a marriage, and bringing\nthe bride from the city Gabatha, who was the daughter of one of the illustrious\nmen among the Arabians, and that the damsel was to be conducted with pomp,\nand splendor, and much riches: so Jonathan and Simon thinking this appeared\nto be the fittest time for them to avenge the death of their brother, and\nthat they had forces sufficient for receiving satisfaction from them for\nhis death, they made haste to Medaba, and lay in wait among the mountains\nfor the coming of their enemies; and as soon as they saw them conducting\nthe virgin, and her bridegroom, and such a great company of their friends\nwith them as was to be expected at this wedding, they sallied out of their\nambush, and slew them all, and took their ornaments, and all the prey that\nthen followed them, and so returned, and received this satisfaction for\ntheir brother John from the sons of Ambri; for as well those sons themselves,\nas their friends, and wives, and children that followed them, perished,\nbeing in number about four hundred.", "However, Simon and Jonathan returned to the lakes of the river, and\nabode there. But Bacchides, when he had secured all Judea with his garrisons,\nreturned to the king; and then it was that the affairs of Judea were quiet\nfor two years. But when the deserters and the wicked saw that Jonathan\nand those that were with him lived in the country very quietly, by reason\nof the peace, they sent to king Demetrius, and excited him to send Bacchides\nto seize upon Jonathan, which they said was to be done without any trouble,\nand in one night's time; and that if they fell upon them before they were\naware, they might slay them all. So the king sent Bacchides, who, when\nhe was come into Judea, wrote to all his friends, both Jews and auxiliaries,\nthat they should seize upon Jonathan, and bring him to him; and when, upon\nall their endeavors, they were not able to seize upon Jonathan, for he\nwas sensible of the snares they laid for him, and very carefully guarded\nagainst them, Bacchides was angry at these deserters, as having imposed\nupon him, and upon the king, and slew fifty of their leaders: whereupon\nJonathan, with his brother, and those that were with him, retired to Bethagla,\na village that lay in the wilderness, out of his fear of Bacchides. He\nalso built towers in it, and encompassed it with walls, and took care that\nit should be safely guarded. Upon the hearing of which Bacchides led his\nown army along with him, and besides took his Jewish auxiliaries, and came\nagainst Jonathan, and made an assault upon his fortifications, and besieged\nhim many days; but Jonathan did not abate of his courage at the zeal Bacchides\nused in the siege, but courageously opposed him. And while he left his\nbrother Simon in the city to fight with Bacchides, he went privately out\nhimself into the country, and got a great body of men together of his own\nparty, and fell upon Bacchides's camp in the night time, and destroyed\na great many of them. His brother Simon knew also of this his falling upon\nthem, because he perceived that the enemies were slain by him; so he sallied\nout upon them, and burnt the engines which the Macedonians used, and made\na great slaughter of them. And when Bacchides saw himself encompassed with\nenemies, and some of them before and some behind him, he fell into despair\nand trouble of mind, as confounded at the unexpected ill success of this\nsiege. However, he vented his displeasure at these misfortunes upon those\ndeserters who sent for him from the king, as having deluded him. So he\nhad a mind to finish this siege after a decent manner, if it were possible\nfor him so to do, and then to return home.", "When Jonathan understood these his intentions, he sent ambassadors\nto him about a league of friendship and mutual assistance, and that they\nmight restore those they had taken captive on both sides. So Bacchides\nthought this a pretty decent way of retiring home, and made a league of\nfriendship with Jonathan, when they sware that they would not any more\nmake war one against another. Accordingly, he restored the captives, and\ntook his own men with him, and returned to the king at Antioch; and after\nthis his departure, he never came into Judea again. Then did Jonathan take\nthe opportunity of this quiet state of things, and went and lived in the\ncity Michmash; and there governed the multitude, and punished the wicked\nand ungodly, and by that means purged the nation of them.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This Alexander Bala, who certainly pretended to be the son of Antiochus\nEpiphanes, and was owned for such by the Jews and Romans, and many others,\nand yet is by several historians deemed to be a counterfeit, and of no\nfamily at all, is, however, by Josephus believed to have been the real\nson of that Antiochus, and by him always spoken of accordingly. And truly,\nsince the original contemporary and authentic author of the First Book\nof Maccabees (10:1) calls him by his father's name, Epiphanes, and says\nhe was the son of Antiochus, I suppose the other writers, who are all much\nlater, are not to be followed against such evidence, though perhaps Epiphanes\nmight have him by a woman of no family.

He was withal slothful and negligent about the public affairs,\nwhereby the hatred of his subjects was the more kindled against him, as\nwe have elsewhere already related. When therefore Demetrius heard that\nAlexander was in Ptolemais, he took his whole army, and led it against\nhim; he also sent ambassadors to Jonathan about a league of mutual assistance\nand friendship, for he resolved to be beforehand with Alexander, lest the\nother should treat with him first, and gain assistance from him; and this\nhe did out of the fear he had lest Jonathan should remember how ill Demetrius\nhad formerly treated him, and should join with him in this war against\nhim. He therefore gave orders that Jonathan should be allowed to raise\nan army, and should get armor made, and should receive back those hostages\nof the Jewish nation whom Baechides had shut up in the citadel of Jerusalem.\nWhen this good fortune had befallen Jonathan, by the concession of Demetrius,\nhe came to Jerusalem, and read the king's letter in the audience of the\npeople, and of those that kept the citadel. When these were read, these\nwicked men and deserters, who were in the citadel, were greatly afraid,\nupon the king's permission to Jonathan to raise an army, and to receive\nback the hostages. So he delivered every one of them to his own parents.\nAnd thus did Jonathan make his abode at Jerusalem, renewing the city to\na better state, and reforming the buildings as he pleased; for he gave\norders that the walls of the city should be rebuilt with square stones,\nthat it might be more secure from their enemies. And when those that kept\nthe garrisons that were in Judea saw this, they all left them, and fled\nto Antioch, excepting those that were in the city Bethsura, and those that\nwere in the citadel of Jerusalem, for the greater part of these was of\nthe wicked Jews and deserters, and on that account these did not deliver\nup their garrisons."}, "When Alexander knew what promises Demetrius had made Jonathan, and\nwithal knew his courage, and what great things he had done when he fought\nthe Macedonians, and besides what hardships he had undergone by the means\nof Demetrius, and of Bacchides, the general of Demetrius's army, he told\nhis friends that he could not at present find any one else that might afford\nhim better assistance than Jonathan, who was both courageous against his\nenemies, and had a particular hatred against Demetrius, as having both\nsuffered many hard things from him, and acted many hard things against\nhim. If therefore they were of opinion that they should make him their\nfriend against Demetrius, it was more for their advantage to invite him\nto assist them now than at another time. It being therefore determined\nby him and his friends to send to Jonathan, he wrote to him this epistle:\n\"King Alexander to his brother Jonathan, sendeth greeting.

The foregoing verse in Isaiah runs thus in our common copies,\n\"In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language\nof Canaan,\" [the Hebrew language; shall be full of Jews, whose sacred\nbooks were in Hebrew,] \"and swear to the Lord of hosts; one\"\n[or the first] \"shall be called, The City of Destruction,\" Isaiah\n19:18.

The Septuagint also, though\nthey have the text disguised in the common copies, and call it Asedek,\nthe City of Righteousness; yet in two or three other copies the Hebrew\nword itself for the Sun, Achares, or Thares, is preserved. And since Onias\ninsists with the king and queen, that Isaiah's prophecy contained many\nother predictions relating to this place besides the words by him recited,\nit is highly probable that these were especially meant by him; and that\none main reason why he applied this prediction to himself, and to his prefecture\nof Heliopolis, which Dean Prideaux well proves was in that part of Egypt,\nand why he chose to build in that prefecture of Heliopolis, though otherwise\nan improper place, was this, that the same authority that he had for building\nthis temple in Egypt, the very same he had for building it in his own prefecture\nof Heliopolis also, which he desired to do, and which he did accordingly.\nDean Prideaux has much ado to avoid seeing this corruption of the Hebrew;\nbut it being in support of his own opinion about this temple, he durst\nnot see it; and indeed he reasons here in the most injudicious manner possible.\nSee him at the year ."}, "#text": "BUT then the son of Onias the high priest, who was of the same name\nwith his father, and who fled to king Ptolemy, who was called Philometor,\nlived now at Alexandria, as we have said already. When this Onias saw that\nJudea was oppressed by the Macedonians and their kings, out of a desire\nto purchase to himself a memorial and eternal fame he resolved to send\nto king Ptolemy and queen Cleopatra, to ask leave of them that he might\nbuild a temple in Egypt like to that at Jerusalem, and might ordain Levites\nand priests out of their own stock. The chief reason why he was desirous\nso to do, was, that he relied upon the prophet Isaiah, who lived above\nsix hundred years before, and foretold that there certainly was to be a\ntemple built to Almighty God in Egypt by a man that was a Jew. Onias was\nelevated with this prediction, and wrote the following epistle to Ptolemy\nand Cleopatra: \"Having done many and great things for you in the affairs\nof the war, by the assistance of God, and that in Celesyria and Phoenicia,\nI came at length with the Jews to Leontopolis, and to other places of your\nnation, where I found that the greatest part of your people had temples\nin an improper manner, and that on this account they bare ill-will one\nagainst another, which happens to the Egyptians by reason of the multitude\nof their temples, and the difference of opinions about Divine worship.\nNow I found a very fit place in a castle that hath its name from the country\nDiana; this place is full of materials of several sorts, and replenished\nwith sacred animals; I desire therefore that you will grant me leave to\npurge this holy place, which belongs to no master, and is fallen down,\nand to build there a temple to Almighty God, after the pattern of that\nin Jerusalem, and of the same dimensions, that may be for the benefit of\nthyself, and thy wife and children, that those Jews which dwell in Egypt\nmay have a place whither they may come and meet together in mutual harmony\none with another, and he subservient to thy advantages; for the prophet\nIsaiah foretold that \"there should be an altar in Egypt to the Lord\nGod; \nand many other such things did he prophesy relating to that place.\""}, "And this was what Onias wrote to king Ptolemy. Now any one may observe\nhis piety, and that of his sister and wife Cleopatra, by that epistle which\nthey wrote in answer to it; for they laid the blame and the transgression\nof the law upon the head of Onias. And this was their reply: \"King\nPtolemy and queen Cleopatra to Onias, send greeting. We have read thy petition,\nwherein thou desirest leave to be given thee to purge that temple which\nis fallen down at Leontopolis, in the Nomus of Heliopolis, and which is\nnamed from the country Bubastis; on which account we cannot but wonder\nthat it should be pleasing to God to have a temple erected in a place so\nunclean, and so full of sacred animals. But since thou sayest that Isaiah\nthe prophet foretold this long ago, we give thee leave to do it, if it\nmay be done according to your law, and so that we may not appear to have\nat all offended God herein.\"", "So Onias took the place, and built a temple, and an altar to God,\nlike indeed to that in Jerusalem, but smaller and poorer. I do not think\nit proper for me now to describe its dimensions or its vessels, which have\nbeen already described in my seventh book of the Wars of the Jews.

They desired therefore\nthe king to sit with his friends, and hear the debates about these matters,\nand punish those with death who were baffled. Now Sabbeus and Theodosius\nmanaged the argument for the Samaritans, and Andronicus, the son of Messalamus,\nfor the people of Jerusalem; and they took an oath by God and the king\nto make their demonstrations according to the law; and they desired of\nPtolemy, that whomsoever he should find that transgressed what they had\nsworn to, he would put him to death. Accordingly, the king took several\nof his friends into the council, and sat down, in order to hear what the\npleaders said. Now the Jews that were at Alexandria were in great concern\nfor those men, whose lot it was to contend for the temple at Jerusalem;\nfor they took it very ill that any should take away the reputation of that\ntemple, which was so ancient and so celebrated all over the habitable earth.\nNow when Sabbeus and Tlteodosius had given leave to Andronicus to speak\nfirst, he began to demonstrate out of the law, and out of the successions\nof the high priests, how they every one in succession from his father had\nreceived that dignity, and ruled over the temple; and how all the kings\nof Asia had honored that temple with their donations, and with the most\nsplendid gifts dedicated thereto. But as for that at Gerizzm, he made no\naccount of it, and regarded it as if it had never had a being. By this\nspeech, and other arguments, Andronicus persuaded the king to determine\nthat the temple at Jerusalem was built according to the laws of Moses,\n and\nto put Sabbeus and Theodosius to death.

But Apollonius, when he heard that Joppa was taken\nby Jonathan, took three thousand horsemen, and eight thousand footmen and\ncame to Ashdod; and removing thence, he made his journey silently and slowly,\nand going up to Joppa, he made as if he was retiring from the place, and\nso drew Jonathan into the plain, as valuing himself highly upon his horsemen,\nand having his hopes of victory principally in them. However, Jonathan\nsallied out, and pursued Apollonius to Ashdod; but as soon as Apollonius\nperceived that his enemy was in the plain, he came back and gave him battle.\nBut Apollonius had laid a thousand horsemen in ambush in a valley, that\nthey might be seen by their enemies as behind them; which when Jonathan\nperceived, he was under no consternation, but ordering his army to stand\nin a square battle-array, he gave them a charge to fall on the enemy on\nboth sides, and set them to face those that attacked them both before and\nbehind; and while the fight lasted till the evening, he gave part of his\nforces to his brother Simon, and ordered him to attack the enemies; but\nfor himself, he charged those that were with him to cover themselves with\ntheir armor, and receive the darts of the horsemen, who did as they were\ncommanded; so that the enemy's horsemen, while they threw their darts till\nthey had no more left, did them no harm, for the darts that were thrown\ndid not enter into their bodies, being thrown upon the shields that were\nunited and conjoined together, the closeness of which easily overcame the\nforce of the darts, and they flew about without any effect. But when the\nenemy grew remiss in throwing their darts from morning till late at night,\nSimon perceived their weariness, and fell upon the body of men before him;\nand because his soldiers showed great alacrity, he put the enemy to flight.\nAnd when the horsemen saw that the footmen ran away, neither did they stay\nthemselves, but they being very weary, by the duration of the fight till\nthe evening, and their hope from the footmen being quite gone, they basely\nran away, and in great confusion also, till they were separated one from\nanother, and scattered over all the plain.

But when Alexander did not comply with his demands, he perceived\nthat it was he himself who laid the design, and was very angry at him.\nAlexander had also formerly been on very ill terms with the people of Antioch,\nfor they had suffered very much by his means; yet did Ammonius at length\nundergo the punishment his insolent crimes had deserved, for he was killed\nin an opprobrious manner, like a woman, while he endeavored to conceal\nhimself in a feminine habit, as we have elsewhere related.", "Hereupon Ptolemy blamed himself for having given his daughter in\nmarriage to Alexander, and for the league he had made with him to assist\nhim against Demetrius; so he dissolved his relation to him, and took his\ndaughter away from him, and immediately sent to Demetrius, and offered\nto make a league of mutual assistance and friendship with him, and agreed\nwith him to give him his daughter in marriage, and to restore him to the\nprincipality of his fathers. Demetrius was well pleased with this embassage,\nand accepted of his assistance, and of the marriage of his daughter. But\nPtolemy had still one more hard task to do, and that was to persuade the\npeople of Antioch to receive Demetrius, because they were greatly displeased\nat him, on account of the injuries his father Demetrius had done them;\nyet did he bring this about; for as the people of Antioch hated Alexander\non Ammonius's account, as we have shown already, they were easily prevailed\nwith to cast him out of Antioch; who, thus expelled out of Antioch, came\ninto Cilicia. Ptolemy came then to Antioch, and was made king by its inhabitants,\nand by the army; so that he was forced to put on two diadems, the one of\nAsia, the other of Egypt: but being naturally a good and a righteous man,\nand not desirous of what belonged to others, and besides these dispositions,\nbeing also a wise man in reasoning about futurities, he determined to avoid\nthe envy of the Romans; so he called the people of Antioch together to\nan assembly, and persuaded them to receive Demetrius; and assured them\nthat he would not be mindful of what they did to his father in case he\nshould he now obliged by them; and he undertook that he would himself be\na good monitor and governor to him, and promised that he would not permit\nhim to attempt any bad actions; but that, for his own part, he was contented\nwith the kingdom of Egypt.

Now it happened in the time of the battle that Ptolemy' horse,\nupon hearing the noise of an elephant, cast him off his back, and threw\nhim on the ground; upon the sight of which accident, his enemies fell upon\nhim, and gave him many wounds upon his head, and brought him into danger\nof death; for when his guards caught him up, he was so very ill, that for\nfour days' time he was not able either to understand or to speak.

But Jonathan the high priest levied an\narmy out of all Judea, and attacked the citadel at Jerusalem, and besieged\nit.

And now when Demetrius saw that there was peace every where, and\nthat there was no danger, nor fear of war, he disbanded the greatest part\nof his army, and diminished their pay, and even retained in pay no others\nthan such foreigners as came up with him from Crete, and from the other\nislands. However, this procured him ill-will and hatred from the soldiers;\non whom he bestowed nothing from this time, while the kings before him\nused to pay them in time of peace as they did before, that they might have\ntheir good-will, and that they might be very ready to undergo the difficulties\nof war, if any occasion should require it."}, "NOW there was a certain commander of Alexander's forces, an Apanemian\nby birth, whose name was Diodotus, and was also called Trypho, took notice\nthe ill-will of the soldiers bare to Demetrius, and went to Malchus the\nArabian, who brought up Antiochus, the son of Alexander, and told him what\nill-will the army bare Demetrius, and persuaded him to give him Antiochus,\nbecause he would make him king, and recover to him the kingdom of his father.\nMalchus at the first opposed him in this attempt, because he could not\nbelieve him; but when Trypho lay hard at him for a long time, he over-persuaded\nhim to comply with Trypho's intentions and entreaties.

Demetrius made answer, that\nafter the war, which he was now deeply engaged in, was over, he would not\nonly grant him that, but greater things than that also; and he desired\nhe would send him some assistance, and informed him that his army had deserted\nhim. So Jonathan chose out three thousand of his soldiers, and sent them\nto Demetrius.", "Now the people of Antioch hated Demetrius, both on account of what\nmischief he had himself done them, and because they were his enemies also\non account of his father Demetrius, who had greatly abused them; so they\nwatched some opportunity which they might lay hold on to fall upon him.\nAnd when they were informed of the assistance that was coming to Demetrius\nfrom Jonathan, and considered at the same time that he would raise a numerous\narmy, unless they prevented him, and seized upon him, they took their weapons\nimmediately, and encompassed his palace in the way of a siege, and seizing\nupon all the ways of getting out, they sought to subdue their king. And\nwhen he saw that the people of Antioch were become his bitter enemies and\nthat they were thus in arms, he took the mercenary soldiers which he had\nwith them, and those Jews who were sent by Jonathan, and assaulted the\nAntiochians; but he was overpowered by them, for they were many ten thousands,\nand was beaten. But when the Jews saw that the Antiochians were superior,\nthey went up to the top of the palace, and shot at them from thence; and\nbecause they were so remote from them by their height, that they suffered\nnothing on their side, but did great execution on the others, as fighting\nfrom such an elevation, they drove them out of the adjoining houses, and\nimmediately set them on fire, whereupon the flame spread itself over the\nwhole city, and burnt it all down. This happened by reason of the closeness\nof the houses, and because they were generally built of wood. So the Antioehians,\nwhen they were not able to help themselves, nor to stop the fire, were\nput to flight. And as the Jews leaped from the top of one house to the\ntop of another, and pursued them after that manner, it thence happened\nthat the pursuit was so very surprising. But when the king saw that the\nAntiochians were were busy in saving their children and their wives, and\nso did not fight any longer, he fell upon them in the narrow passages,\nand fought them, and slew a great many of them, till at last they were\nforced to throw down their arms, and to deliver themselves up to Demetrius.\nSo he forgave them this their insolent behavior, and put an end to the\nsedition; and when he had given rewards to the Jews out of the rich spoils\nhe had gotten, and had returned them thanks, as the cause of his victory,\nhe sent them away to Jerusalem to Jonathan, with an ample testimony of\nthe assistance they had afforded him. Yet did he prove an ill man to Jonathan\nafterward, and broke the promises he had made; and he threatened that he\nwould make war upon him, unless he would pay all that tribute which the\nJewish nation owed to the first kings [of Syria]. And this he had done,\nif Trypho had not hindered him, and diverted his preparations against Jonathan\nto a concern for his own preservation; for he now returned out of Arabia\ninto Syria, with the child Antiochus, for he was yet in age but a youth,\nand put the diadem on his head; and as the whole forces that had left Demetrius,\nbecause they had no pay, came to his assistance, he made war upon Demetrius,\nand joining battle with him, overcame him in the fight, and took from him\nboth his elephants and the city Antioch.", "Demetrius, upon this defeat, retired into Cilicia; but the child\nAntiochus sent ambassadors and an epistle to Jonathan, and made him his\nfriend and confederate, and confirmed to him the high priesthood, and yielded\nup to him the four prefectures which had been added to Judea. Moreover,\nhe sent him vessels and cups of gold, and a purple garment, and gave him\nleave to use them. He also presented him with a golden button, and styled\nhim one of his principal friends, and appointed his brother Simon to be\nthe general over the forces, from the Ladder of Tyre unto Egypt. So Jonathan\nwas so pleased with these grants made him by Antiochus, that he sent ambassadors\nto him and to Trypho, and professed himself to be their friend and confederate,\nand said he would join with him in a war against Demetrius, informing him\nthat he had made no proper returns for the kindness he had done him; for\nthat when he had received many marks of kindness from him, when he stood\nin great need of them, he, for such good turns, had requited him with further\ninjuries.", "So Antiochus gave Jonathan leave to raise himself a numerous army\nout of Syria and Phoenicia and to make war against Demetrius's generals;\nwhereupon he went in haste to the several cities which received him splendidly\nindeed, but put no forces into his hands. And when he was come from thence\nto Askelon, the inhabitants of Askelon came and brought him presents, and\nmet him in a splendid manner. He exhorted them, and every one of the cities\nof Celesyria, to forsake Demetrius, and to join with Antiochus; and, in\nassisting him, to endeavor to punish Demetrius for what offenses he had\nbeen guilty of against themselves; and told them there were many reasons\nfor that their procedure, if they had a mind so to do. And when he had\npersuaded those cities to promise their assistance to Antiochus, he came\nto Gaza, in order to induce them also to be friends to Antiochus; but he\nfound the inhabitants of Gaza much more alienated from him than he expected,\nfor they had shut their gates against him; and although they had deserted\nDemetrius, they had not resolved to join themselves to Antiochus. This\nprovoked Jonathan to besiege them, and to harass their country; for as\nhe set a part of his army round about Gaza itself, so with the rest he\noverran their land, and spoiled it, and burnt what was in it. When the\nof Gaza saw themselves in this state of affliction, and that no assistance\ncame to them from Demetrius, that what distressed them was at hand, but\nwhat should profit them was still at a great distance, and it was uncertain\nwhether it would come at all or not, they thought it would he prudent conduct\nto leave off any longer continuance with them, and to cultivate friendship\nwith the other; so they sent to Jonathan, and professed they would be his\nfriends, and afford him assistance: for such is the temper of men, that\nbefore they have had the trial of great afflictions, they do not understand\nwhat is for their advantage; but when they find themselves under such afflictions,\nthey then change their minds, and what it had been better for them to have\ndone before they had been at all damaged, they choose to do, but not till\nafter they have suffered such damages.

But as Simon was raising\nbanks, and bringing his engines of war against Bethsura, and was very earnest\nabout the siege of it, the garrison was afraid lest the place should be\ntaken of Simon by force, and they put to the sword; so they sent to Simon,\nand desired the security of his oath, that they should come to no harm\nfrom him, and that they would leave the place, and go away to Demetrius.\nAccordingly he gave them his oath, and ejected them out of the city, and\nhe put therein a garrison of his own.", "But Jonathan removed out of Galilee, and from the waters which are\ncalled Gennesar, for there he was before encamped, and came into the plain\nthat is called Asor, without knowing that the enemy was there. When therefore\nDemetrius's men knew a day beforehand that Jonathan was coming against\nthem, they laid an ambush in the mountain, who were to assault him on the\nsudden, while they themselves met him with an army in the plain; which\narmy, when Jonathan saw ready to engage him, he also got ready his own\nsoldiers for the battle as well as he was able; but those that were laid\nin ambush by Demetrius's generals being behind them, the Jews were afraid\nlest they should be caught in the midst between two bodies, and perish;\nso they ran away in haste, and indeed all the rest left Jonathan; but a\nfew there were, in number about fifty, who staid with him, and with them\nMattathias, the son of Absalom, and Judas, the son of Chapseus, who were\ncommanders of the whole army. These marched boldly, and like men desperate,\nagainst the enemy, and so pushed them, that by their courage they daunted\nthem, and with their weapons in their hands they put them to flight.

But when Simon saw that the people\nof Jerusalem were terrified at the circumstances they were in, he desired\nto make a speech to them, and thereby to render them more resolute in opposing\nTrypho when he should come against them.

He told Hyrcanus that Eleazar had cast such a reproach\nupon him, according to the common sentiments of all the Pharisees, and\nthat this would be made manifest if he would but ask them the question,\nWhat punishment they thought this man deserved? for that he might depend\nupon it, that the reproach was not laid on him with their approbation,\nif they were for punishing him as his crime deserved. So the Pharisees\nmade answer, that he deserved stripes and bonds, but that it did not seem\nright to punish reproaches with death. And indeed the Pharisees, even upon\nother occasions, are not apt to be severe in punishments. At this gentle\nsentence, Hyrcanus was very angry, and thought that this man reproached\nhim by their approbation. It was this Jonathan who chiefly irritated him,\nand influenced him so far, that he made him leave the party of the Pharisees,\nand abolish the decrees they had imposed on the people, and to punish those\nthat observed them. From this source arose that hatred which he and his\nsons met with from the multitude: but of these matters we shall speak hereafter.\nWhat I would now explain is this, that the Pharisees have delivered to\nthe people a great many observances by succession from their fathers, which\nare not written in the laws of Moses; and for that reason it is that the\nSadducees reject them, and say that we are to esteem those observances\nto be obligatory which are in the written word, but are not to observe\nwhat are derived from the tradition of our forefathers. And concerning\nthese things it is that great disputes and differences have arisen among\nthem, while the Sadducees are able to persuade none but the rich, and have\nnot the populace obsequious to them, but the Pharisees have the multitude\non their side.

Alexander left behind him two sons, Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, but\ncommitted the kingdom to Alexandra. Now, as to these two sons, Hyrcanus\nwas indeed unable to manage public affairs, and delighted rather in a quiet\nlife; but the younger, Aristobulus, was an active and a bold man; and for\nthis woman herself, Alexandra, she was loved by the multitude, because\nshe seemed displeased at the offenses her husband had been guilty of.", "So she made Hyrcanus high priest, because he was the elder, but much\nmore because he cared not to meddle with politics, and permitted the Pharisees\nto do every thing; to whom also she ordered the multitude to be obedient.\nShe also restored again those practices which the Pharisees had introduced,\naccording to the traditions of their forefathers, and which her father-in-law,\nHyrcanus, had abrogated. So she had indeed the name of the regent, but\nthe Pharisees had the authority; for it was they who restored such as had\nbeen banished, and set such as were prisoners at liberty, and, to say all\nat once, they differed in nothing from lords. However, the queen also took\ncare of the affairs of the kingdom, and got together a great body of mercenary\nsoldiers, and increased her own army to such a degree, that she became\nterrible to the neighboring tyrants, and took hostages of them: and the\ncountry was entirely at peace, excepting the Pharisees; for they disturbed\nthe queen, and desired that she would kill those who persuaded Alexander\nto slay the eight hundred men; after which they cut the throat of one of\nthem, Diogenes; and after him they did the same to several, one after another,\ntill the men that were the most potent came into the palace, and Aristobulus\nwith them, for he seemed to be displeased at what was done; and it appeared\nopenly, that if he had an opportunity, he would not permit his mother to\ngo on so. These put the queen in mind what great dangers they had gone\nthrough, and great things they had done, whereby they had demonstrated\nthe firmness of their fidelity to their master, insomuch that they had\nrecieved the greatest marks of favor from him; and they begged of her,\nthat she would not utterly blast their hopes, as it now happened, that\nwhen they had escaped the hazards that arose from their [open] enemies,\nthey were to be cut off at home by their [private] enemies, like brute\nbeasts, without any help whatsoever. They said also, that if their adversaries\nwould be satisfied with those that had been slain already, they would take\nwhat had been done patiently, on account of their natural love to their\ngovernors; but if they must expect the same for the future also, they implored\nof her a dismission from her service; for they could not bear to think\nof attempting any method for their deliverance without her, but would rather\ndie willingly before the palace gate, in case she would not forgive them.\nAnd that it was a great shame, both for themselves and for the queen, that\nwhen they were neglected by her, they should come under the lash of her\nhusband's enemies; for that Aretas, the Arabian king, and the monarchs,\nwould give any reward, if they could get such men as foreign auxiliaries,\nto whom their very names, before their voices be heard, may perhaps be\nterrible; but if they could not obtain this their second request, and if\nshe had determined to prefer the Pharisees before them, they still insisted\nthat she would place them every one in her fortresses; for if some fatal\ndemon hath a constant spite against Alexander's house, they would be willing\nto bear their part, and to live in a private station there.", "As these men said thus, and called upon Alexander's ghost for commiseration\nof those already slain, and those in danger of it, all the bystanders brake\nout into tears. But Aristobulus chiefly made manifest what were his sentiments,\nand used. many reproachful expressions to his mother, [saying,] \"Nay,\nindeed, the case is this, that they have been themselves the authors of\ntheir own calamities, who have permitted a woman who, against reason, was\nmad with ambition, to reign over them, when there were sons in the flower\nof their age fitter for it.\" So Alexandra, not knowing what to do\nwith any decency, committed the fortresses to them, all but Hyrcania, and\nAlexandrium, and Macherus, where her principal treasures were.

What they were principally afraid of was this, that\nhe would inflict punishment upon them for the mad treatment his house had\nhad from them. So they resolved to take his wife and children into custody,\nand keep them in the fortress that was over the temple. \nNow there was a mighty conflux of people that came to Aristobulus from\nall parts, insomuch that he had a kind of royal attendants about him; for\nin a little more than fifteen days he got twenty-two strong places, which\ngave him the opportunity of raising an army from Libanus and Trachonitis,\nand the monarchs; for men are easily led by the greater number, and easily\nsubmit to them.

soldiers deserted him, and\nwent over to his brother; upon which Hyrcanus fled into the citadel, where\nAristobulus's wife and children were imprisoned by their mother, as we\nhave said already, and attacked and overcame those his adversaries that\nhad fled thither, and lay within the walls of the temple. So when he had\nsent a message to his brother about agreeing the matters between them,\nhe laid aside his enmity to him on these conditions, that Aristobulus should\nbe king, that he should live without intermeddling with public affairs,\nand quietly enjoy the estate he had acquired. When they had agreed upon\nthese terms in the temple, and had confirmed the agreement with oaths,\nand the giving one an. other their right hands, and embracing one another\nin the sight of the whole multitude, they departed; the one, Aristobulus,\nto the palace; and Hyrcanus, as a private man, to the former house of Aristobulus.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "That the famous Antipater's or Antipas's father was also Antipater or Antipas\n(which two may justly be esteemed one and the same frame, the former with\na Greek or Gentile, the latter with a Hebrew or Jewish termination) Josephus\nhere assures us, though Eusebias indeed says it was Herod."}, "#text": "But there was a certain friend of Hyrcanus, an Idumean, called Antipater,\nwho was very rich, and in his nature an active and a seditious man; who\nwas at enmity with Aristobulus, and had differences with him on account\nof his good-will to Hyrcanus. It is true that Nicolatls of Damascus says,\nthat Antipater was of the stock of the principal Jews who came out of Babylon\ninto Judea; but that assertion of his was to gratify Herod, who was his\nson, and who, by certain revolutions of fortune, came afterward to be king\nof the Jews, whose history we shall give you in its proper place hereafter.\nHowever, this Antipater was at first called Antipas, \nand that was his father's name also; of whom they relate this: That king\nAlexander and his wife made him general of all Idumea, and that he made\na league of friendship with those Arabians, and Gazites, and Ascalonites,\nthat were of his own party, and had, by many and large presents, made them\nhis fast friends. But now this younger Antipater was suspicious of the\npower of Aristobulus, and was afraid of some mischief he might do him,\nbecause of his hatred to him; so he stirred up the most powerful of the\nJews, and talked against him to them privately; and said that it was unjust\nto overlook the conduct of Aristobulus, who had gotten the government unrighteously,\nand ejected his brother out of it, who was the elder, and ought to retain\nwhat belonged to him by prerogative of his birth. And the same speeches\nhe perpetually made to Hyrcanus; and told him that his own life would be\nin danger, unless he guarded himself, and got shut of Aristobulus; for\nhe said that the friends of Aristobulus omitted no opportunity of advising\nhim to kill him, as being then, and not before, sure to retain his principality.\nHyrcanus gave no credit to these words of his, as being of a gentle disposition,\nand one that did not easily admit of calumnies against other men. This\ntemper of his not disposing him to meddle with public affairs, and want\nof spirit, occasioned him to appear to spectators to be degenerous and\nunmanly; while. Aristo-bulus was of a contrary temper, an active man, and\none of a great and generous soul."}, "Since therefore Antipater saw that Hyrcanus did not attend to what\nhe said, he never ceased, day by day, to charge reigned crimes upon Aristobulus,\nand to calumniate him before him, as if he had a mind to kill him; and\nso, by urging him perpetually, he advised him, and persuaded him to fly\nto Aretas, the king of Arabia; and promised, that if he would comply with\nhis advice, he would also himself assist him and go with him]. When Hyrcanus\nheard this, he said that it was for his advantage to fly away to Aretas.\nNow Arabia is a country that borders upon Judea. However, Hyrcanus sent\nAntipater first to the king of Arabia, in order to receive assurances from\nhim, that when he should come in the manner of a supplicant to him, he\nwould not deliver him up to his enemies. So Antipater having received such\nassurances, returned to Hyrcanus to Jerusalem. A while afterward he took\nHyrcanus, and stole out of the city by night, and went a great journey,\nand came and brought him to the city called Petra, where the palace of\nAretas was; and as he was a very familiar friend of that king, he persuaded\nhim to bring back Hyrcanus into Judea, and this persuasion he continued\nevery day without any intermission. He also proposed to make him presents\non that account. At length he prevailed with Aretas in his suit. Moreover,\nHyrcanus promised him, that when he had been brought thither, and had received\nhis kingdom, he would restore that country, and those twelve cities which\nhis father Alexander had taken from the Arabians, which were these, Medaba,\nNaballo, Libias, Tharabasa, Agala, Athone, Zoar, Orone, Marissa, Rudda,\nLussa, and Oruba.", "AFTER these promises had been given to Aretas, he made an expedition\nagainst Aristobulus with an army of fifty thousand horse and foot, and\nbeat him in the battle. And when after that victory many went over to Hyrcanus\nas deserters, Aristobulus was left desolate, and fled to Jerusalem; upon\nwhich the king of Arabia took all his army, and made an assault upon the\ntemple, and besieged Aristobulus therein, the people still supporting Hyreanus,\nand assisting him in the siege, while none but the priests continued with\nAristobulus. So Aretas united the forces of the Arabians and of the Jews\ntogether, and pressed on the siege vigorously. As this happened at the\ntime when the feast of unleavened bread was celebrated, which we call the\npassover, the principal men among the Jews left the country, and fled into\nEgypt. Now there was one, whose name was Onias, a righteous man be was,\nand beloved of God, who, in a certain drought, had prayed to God to put\nan end to the intense heat, and whose prayers God had heard, and had sent\nthem rain. This man had hid himself, because he saw that this sedition\nwould last a great while. However, they brought him to the Jewish camp,\nand desired, that as by his prayers he had once put an end to the drought,\nso he would in like manner make imprecations on Aristobulus and those of\nhis faction. And when, upon his refusal, and the excuses that he made,\nhe was still by the multitude compelled to speak, he stood up in the midst\nof them, and said, \"O God, the King of the whole world! since those\nthat stand now with me are thy people, and those that are besieged are\nalso thy priests, I beseech thee, that thou wilt neither hearken to the\nprayers of those against these, nor bring to effect what these pray against\nthose.\" Whereupon such wicked Jews as stood about him, as soon as\nhe had made this prayer, stoned him to death.", "But God punished them immediately for this their barbarity, and took\nvengeance of them for the murder of Onias, in the manner following: While\nthe priests and Aristobulus were besieged, it happened that the feast called\nthe passover was come, at which it is our custom to offer a great number\nof sacrifices to God; but those that were with Aristobulus wanted sacrifices,\nand desired that their countrymen without would furnish them with such\nsacrifices, and assured them they should have as much money for them as\nthey should desire; and when they required them to pay a thousand drachmae\nfor each head of cattle, Aristobulus and the priests willingly undertook\nto pay for them accordingly, and those within let down the money over the\nwalls, and gave it them. But when the others had received it, they did\nnot deliver the sacrifices, but arrived at that height of wickedness as\nto break the assurances they had given, and to be guilty of impiety towards\nGod, by not furnishing those that wanted them with sacrifices. And when\nthe priests found they had been cheated, and that the agreements they had\nmade were violated, they prayed to God that he would avenge them on their\ncountrymen. Nor did he delay that their punishment, but sent a strong and\nvehement storm of wind, that destroyed the fruits of the whole country,\ntill a modius of wheat was then bought for eleven drachmae.", "In the mean time Pompey sent Scaurus into Syria, while he was himself\nin Armenia, and making war with Tigranes; but when Scaurus was come to\nDamascus, and found that Lollins and Metellus had newly taken the city,\nhe came himself hastily into Judea. And when he was come thither, ambassadors\ncame to him, both from Aristobulus and Hyrcanus, and both desired he would\nassist them. And when both of them promised to give him money, Aristobulus\nfour hundred talents, and Hyrcanus no less, he accepted of Aristobulus's\npromise, for he was rich, and had a great soul, and desired to obtain nothing\nbut what was moderate; whereas the other was poor, and tenacious, and made\nincredible promises in hopes of greater advantages; for it was not the\nsame thing to take a city that was exceeding strong and powerful, as it\nwas to eject out of the country some fugitives, with a greater number of\nMabateans, who were no very warlike people. He therefore made an agreement\nwith Aristobulus, for the reasons before mentioned, and took his money,\nand raised the siege, and ordered Aretas to depart, or else he should be\ndeclared an enemy to the Romans. So Scaurus returned to Damascus again;\nand Aristobulus, with a great army, made war with Aretas and Hyrcanus,\nand fought them at a place called Papyron, and beat them in the battle,\nand slew about six thousand of the enemy, with whom fell Phalion also,\nthe brother of Antipater.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This \"golden vine,\" or \"garden,\" seen by Strabo at\nRome, has its inscription here as if it were the gift of Alexander, the\nfather of Aristobulus, and not of Aristobulus himself, to whom yet Josephus\nascribes it; and in order to prove the truth of that part of his history,\nintroduces this testimony of Strabo; so that the ordinary copies seem to\nbe here either erroneous or defective, and the original reading seems to\nhave been either Aristobulus, instead of Alexander, with one Greek copy,\nor else \"Aristobulus the son of Alexander,\" with the Latin copies;\nwhich last seems to me the most probable. For as to Archbishop Usher's\nconjectures, that Alexander made it, and dedicated it to God in the temple,\nand that thence Aristobulus took it, and sent it to Pompey, they are both\nvery improbable, and no way agreeable to Josephus, who would hardly have\navoided the recording both these uncommon points of history, had he known\nany thing of them; nor would either the Jewish nation, or even Pompey himself,\nthen have relished such a flagrant instance of sacrilege."}, "emph": ["vine", "garden", "the Delight"], "#text": "A LITTLE afterward Pompey came to Damascus, and marched over Celesyria;\nat which time there came ambassadors to him from all Syria, and Egypt,\nand out of Judea also, for Aristobulus had sent him a great present, which\nwas a golden vine \nof the value of five hundred talents. Now Strabo of Cappadocia mentions\nthis present in these words: \"There came also an embassage out of\nEgypt, and a crown of the value of four thousand pieces of gold; and out\nof Judea there came another, whether you call it a  or a ;\nthey call the thing Terpole, . However, we ourselves\nsaw that present reposited at Rome, in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus,\nwith this inscription, 'The gift of Alexander, the king of the Jews.' It\nwas valued at five hundred talents; and the report is, that Aristobulus,\nthe governor of the Jews, sent it.\""}, "In a little time afterward came ambassadors again to him, Antipater\nfrom Hyrcanus, and Nicodemus from Aristobulus; which last also accused\nsuch as had taken bribes; first Gabinius, and then Scaurus, - the one three\nhundred talents, and the other four hundred; by which procedure he made\nthese two his enemies, besides those he had before. And when Pompey had\nordered those that had controversies one with another to come to him in\nthe beginning of the spring, he brought his army out of their winter quarters,\nand marched into the country of Damascus; and as he went along he demolished\nthe citadel that was at Apamia, which Antiochus Cyzicenus had built, and\ntook cognizance of the country of Ptolemy Menneus, a wicked man, and not\nless so than Dionysius of Tripoli, who had been beheaded, who was also\nhis relation by marriage; yet did he buy off the punishment of his crimes\nfor a thousand talents, with which money Pompey paid the soldiers their\nwages. He also conquered the place called Lysias, of which Silas a Jew\nwas tyrant. And when he had passed over the cities of Heliopolis and Chalcis,\nand got over the mountain which is on the limit of Colesyria, he came from\nPella to Damascus; and there it was that he heard the causes of the Jews,\nand of their governors Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, who were at difference\none with another, as also of the nation against them both, which did not\ndesire to be under kingly' government, because the form of government they\nreceived from their forefathers was that of subjection to the priests of\nthat God whom they worshipped; and [they complained], that though these\ntwo were the posterity of priests, yet did they seek to change the government\nof their nation to another form, in order to enslave them. Hyrcanus complained,\nthat although he were the elder brother, he was deprived of the prerogative\nof his birth by Aristobulus, and that he had but a small part of the country\nunder him, Aristobulus having taken away the rest from him by force. He\nalso accused him, that the incursions which had been made into their neighbors'\ncountries, and the piracies that had been at sea, were owing to him; and\nthat the nation would not have revolted, unless Aristobulus had been a\nman given to violence and disorder; and there were no fewer than a thousand\nJews, of the best esteem among them, who confirmed this accusation; which\nconfirmation was procured by Antipater. But Aristobulus alleged against\nhim, that it was Hyrcanus's own temper, which was inactive, and on that\naccount contemptible, which caused him to be deprived of the government;\nand that for himself, he was necessitated to take it upon him, for fear\nlest it should be transferred to others. And that as to his title [of king],\nit was no other than what his father had taken [before him].

In the mean time, he ordered them to be quiet;\nand treated Aristobulus civilly, lest he should make the nation revolt,\nand hinder his return; which yet Aristobulus did; for without expecting\nany further determination, which Pompey had promised them, he went to the\ncity Delius, and thence marched into Judea.", "At this behavior Pompey was angry; and taking with him that army\nwhich he was leading against the Nabateans, and the auxiliaries that came\nfrom Damascus, and the other parts of Syria, with the other Roman legions\nwhich he had with him, he made an expedition against Aristobulus; but as\nhe passed by Pella and Scythopolis, he came to Corem, which is the first\nentrance into Judea when one passes over the midland countries, where he\ncame to a most beautiful fortress that was built on the top of a mountain\ncalled Alexandrium, whither Aristobulus had fled; and thence Pompey sent\nhis commands to him, that he should come to him. Accordingly, at the persuasions\nof many that he would not make war with the Romans, he came down; and when\nhe had disputed with his brother about the right to the government, he\nwent up again to the citadel, as Pompey gave him leave to do; and this\nhe did two or three times, as flattering himself with the hopes of having\nthe kingdom granted him; so that he still pretended he would obey Pompey\nin whatsoever he commanded, although at the same time he retired to his\nfortress, that he might not depress himself too low, and that he might\nbe prepared for a war, in case it should prove as he feared, that Pompey\nwould transfer the government to Hyrcanus. But when Pompey enjoined Aristobulus\nto deliver up the fortresses he held, and to send an injunction to their\ngovernors under his own hand for that purpose, for they had been forbidden\nto deliver them up upon any other commands, he submitted indeed to do so;\nbut still he retired in displeasure to Jerusalem, and made preparation\nfor war.

So Pompey sent his lieutenant Piso\nwith an army, and placed garrisons both in the city and in the palace,\nto secure them, and fortified the houses that joined to the temple, and\nall those which were more distant and without it.

But now all was full of slaughter; some of the Jews being\nslain by the Romans, and some by one another; nay, some there were who\nthrew themselves down the precipices, or put fire to their houses, and\nburnt them, as not able to bear the miseries they were under. Of the Jews\nthere fell twelve thousand, but of the Romans very few. Absalom, who was\nat once both uncle and father-in-law to Aristobulus, was taken captive;\nand no small enormities were committed about the temple itself, which,\nin former ages, had been inaccessible, and seen by none; for Pompey went\ninto it, and not a few of those that were with him also, and saw all that\nwhich it was unlawful for any other men to see but only for the high priests.\nThere were in that temple the golden table, the holy candlestick, and the\npouring vessels, and a great quantity of spices; and besides these there\nwere among the treasures two thousand talents of sacred money: yet did\nPompey touch nothing of all this, \non account of his regard to religion; and in this point also he acted in\na manner that was worthy of his virtue. The next day he gave order to those\nthat had the charge of the temple to cleanse it, and to bring what offerings\nthe law required to God; and restored the high priesthood to Hyrcanus,\nboth because he had been useful to him in other respects, and because he\nhindered the Jews in the country from giving Aristobulus any assistance\nin his war against him. He also cut off those that had been the authors\nof that war; and bestowed proper rewards on Faustus, and those others that\nmounted the wall with such alacrity; and he made Jerusalem tributary to\nthe Romans, and took away those cities of Celesyria which the inhabitants\nof Judea had subdued, and put them under the government of the Roman president,\nand confined the whole nation, which had elevated itself so high before,\nwithin its own bounds. Moreover, he rebuilt Gadara, \nwhich had been demolished a little before, to gratify Demetrius of Gadara,\nwho was his freedman, and restored the rest of the cities, Hippos, and\nScythopolis, and Pella, and Dios, and Samaria, as also Marissa, and Ashdod,\nand Jamnia, and Arethusa, to their own inhabitants: these were in the inland\nparts. Besides those that had been demolished, and also of the maritime\ncities, Gaza, and Joppa, and Dora, and Strato's Tower; which last Herod\nrebuilt after a glorious manner, and adorned with havens and temples, and\nchanged its name to Caesarea.

Moreover, the Romans exacted of\nus, in a little time, above ten thousand talents; and the royal authority,\nwhich was a dignity formerly bestowed on those that were high priests,\nby the right of their family, became the property of private men. But of\nthese matters we shall treat in their proper places. Now Pompey committed\nCelesyria, as far as the river Euphrates and Egypt, to Scaurus, with two\nRoman legions, and then went away to Cilicia, and made haste to Rome. He\nalso carried bound along with him Aristobulus and his children; for he\nhad two daughters, and as many sons; the one of which ran away, but the\nyounger, Antigonus, was carried to Rome, together with his sisters.", "SCAURUS made now an expedition against Petrea, in Arabia, and set\non fire all the places round about it, because of the great difficulty\nof access to it. And as his army was pinched by famine, Antipater furnished\nhim with corn out of Judea, and with whatever else he wanted, and this\nat the command of Hyrcanus. And when he was sent to Aretas, as an ambassador\nby Scaurus, because he had lived with him formerly, he persuaded Aretas\nto give Scaurus a sum of money, to prevent the burning of his country,\nand undertook to be his surety for three hundred talents. So Scaurus, upon\nthese terms, ceased to make war any longer; which was done as much at Scaurus's\ndesire, as at the desire of Aretas.", "Some time after this, when Alexander, the son of Aristobulus, made\nan incursion into Judea, Gabinius came from Rome into Syria, as commander\nof the Roman forces. He did many considerable actions; and particularly\nmade war with Alexander, since Hyrcanus was not yet able to oppose his\npower, but was already attempting to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, which\nPompey had overthrown, although the Romans which were there restrained\nhim from that his design. However, Alexander went over all the country\nround about, and armed many of the Jews, and suddenly got together ten\nthousand armed footmen, and fifteen hundred horsemen, and fortified Alexandrium,\na fortress near to Corem, and Macherus, near the mountains of Arabia. Gabinius\ntherefore came upon him, having sent Marcus Antonius, with other commanders,\nbefore. These armed such Romans as followed them; and, together with them,\nsuch Jews as were subject to them, whose leaders were Pitholaus and Malichus;\nand they took with them also their friends that were with Antipater, and\nmet Alexander, while Gabinius himself followed with his legion.

But when Alexander's mother, who\nwas of the side of the Romans, as having her husband and other children\nat Rome, came to him, he granted her whatsoever she asked; and when he\nhad settled matters with her, he brought Hyrcanus to Jerusalem, and committed\nthe care of the temple to him. And when he had ordained five councils,\nhe distributed the nation into the same number of parts. So these councils\ngoverned the people; the first was at Jerusalem, the second at Gadara,\nthe third at Amathus, the fourth at Jericho, and the fifth at Sepphoris\nin Galilee. So the Jews were now freed from monarchic authority, and were\ngoverned by an aristocracy.", "NOW Aristobulus ran away from Rome to Judea, and set about the rebuilding\nof Alexandrium, which had been newly demolished. Hereupon Gabinius sent\nsoldiers against him, add for their commanders Sisenna, and Antonius, and\nServilius, in order to hinder him from getting possession of the country,\nand to take him again. And indeed many of the Jews ran to Aristobulus,\non account of his former glory, as also because they should be glad of\nan innovation. Now there was one Pitholaus, a lieutenant at Jerusalem,\nwho deserted to him with a thousand men, although a great number of those\nthat came to him were unarmed; and when Aristobulus had resolved to go\nto Macherus, he dismissed those people, because they were unarmed; for\nthey could not be useful to him in what actions he was going about; but\nhe took with him eight thousand that were armed, and marched on; and as\nthe Romans fell upon them severely, the Jews fought valiantly, but were\nbeaten in the battle; and when they had fought with alacrity, but were\noverborne by the enemy, they were put to flight; of whom were slain about\nfive thousand, and the rest being dispersed, tried, as well as they were\nable, to save themselves. However, Aristobulus had with him still above\na thousand, and with them he fled to Macherus, and fortified the place;\nand though he had had ill success, he still had good hope of his affairs;\nbut when he had struggled against the siege for two days' time, and had\nreceived many wounds, he was brought as a captive to Gabinius, with his\nson Antigonus, who also fled with him from Rome. And this was the fortune\nof Aristobulus, who was sent back again to Rome, and was there retained\nin bonds, having been both king and high priest for three years and six\nmonths; and was indeed an eminent person, and one of a great soul.

But when\nhe came back out of Egypt, he found Syria in disorder, with seditions and\ntroubles; for Alexander, the son of Aristobulus, having seized on the government\na second time by force, made many of the Jews revolt to him; and so he\nmarched over the country with a great army, and slew all the Romans he\ncould light upon, and proceeded to besiege the mountain called Gerizzim,\nwhither they had retreated."}, "But when Gabinius found Syria in such a state, he sent Antipater,\nwho was a prudent man, to those that were seditious, to try whether he\ncould cure them of their madness, and persuade them to return to a better\nmind; and when he came to them, he brought many of them to a sound mind,\nand induced them to do what they ought to do; but he could not restrain\nAlexander, for he had an army of thirty thousand Jews, and met Gabinius,\nand joining battle with him, was beaten, and lost ten thousand of his men\nabout Mount Tabor.", "So Gabinius settled the affairs which belonged to the city Jerusalem,\nas was agreeable to Antipater's inclination, and went against the Nabateans,\nand overcame them in battle. He also sent away in a friendly manner Mithridates\nand Orsanes, who were Parthian deserters, and came to him, though the report\nwent abroad that they had run away from him. And when Gabinius had performed\ngreat and glorious actions, in his management of the affairs of war, he\nreturned to Rome, and delivered the government to Crassus. Now Nicolaus\nof Damascus, and Strabo of Cappadocia, both describe the expeditions of\nPompey and Gabinius against the Jews, while neither of them say anything\nnew which is not in the other.", "Now Crassus, as he was going upon his expedition against the Parthians,\ncame into Judea, and carried off the money that was in the temple, which\nPompey had left, being two thousand talents, and was disposed to spoil\nit of all the gold belonging to it, which was eight thousand talents. He\nalso took a beam, which was made of solid beaten gold, of the weight of\nthree hundred minae, each of which weighed two pounds and a half. It was\nthe priest who was guardian of the sacred treasures, and whose name was\nEleazar, that gave him this beam, not out of a wicked design, for he was\na good and a righteous man; but being intrusted with the custody of the\nveils belonging to the temple, which were of admirable beauty, and of very\ncostly workmanship, and hung down from this beam, when lie saw that Crassus\nwas busy in gathering money, and was in fear for the entire ornaments of\nthe temple, he gave him this beam of gold as a ransom for the whole, but\nthis not till he had given his oath that he would remove nothing else out\nof the temple, but be satisfied with this only, which he should give him,\nbeing worth many ten thousand [shekels]. Now this beam was contained in\na wooden beam that was hollow, but was known to no others; but Eleazar\nalone knew it; yet did Crassus take away this beam, upon the condition\nof touching nothing else that belonged to the temple, and then brake his\noath, and carried away all the gold that was in the temple.", "And let no one wonder that there was so much wealth in our temple,\nsince all the Jews throughout the habitable earth, and those that worshipped\nGod, nay, even those of Asia and Europe, sent their contributions to it,\nand this from very ancient times. Nor is the largeness of these sums without\nits attestation; nor is that greatness owing to our vanity, as raising\nit without ground to so great a height; but there are many witnesses to\nit, and particularly Strabo of Cappadocia, who says thus: \"Mithridates\nsent to Cos, and took the money which queen Cleopatra had deposited there,\nas also eight hundred talents belonging to the Jews.\" Now we have\nno public money but only what appertains to God; and it is evident that\nthe Asian Jews removed this money out of fear of Mithridates; for it is\nnot probable that those of Judea, who had a strong city and temple, should\nsend their money to Cos; nor is it likely that the Jews who are inhabitants\nof Alexandria should do so neither, since they were ill no fear of Mithridates.\nAnd Strabo himself bears witness to the same thing in another place, that\nat the same time that Sylla passed over into Greece, in order to fight\nagainst Mithridates, he sent Lucullus to put an end to a sedition that\nour nation, of whom the habitable earth is full, had raised in Cyrene;\nwhere he speaks thus: \"There were four classes of men among those\nof Cyrene; that of citizens, that of husbandmen, the third of strangers,\nand the fourth of Jews. Now these Jews are already gotten into all cities;\nand it is hard to find a place in the habitable earth that hath not admitted\nthis tribe of men, and is not possessed by them; and it hath come to pass\nthat Egypt and Cyrene, as having the same governors, and a great number\nof other nations, imitate their way of living, and maintain great bodies\nof these Jews in a peculiar manner, and grow up to greater prosperity with\nthem, and make use of the same laws with that nation also. Accordingly,\nthe Jews have places assigned them in Egypt, wherein they inhabit, besides\nwhat is peculiarly allotted to this nation at Alexandria, which is a large\npart of that city. There is also an ethnarch allowed them, who governs\nthe nation, and distributes justice to them, and takes care of their contracts,\nand of the laws to them belonging, as if he were the ruler of a free republic.\nIn Egypt, therefore, this nation is powerful, because the Jews were originally\nEgyptians, and because the land wherein they inhabit, since they went thence,\nis near to Egypt. They also removed into Cyrene, because that this land\nadjoined to the government of Egypt, as well as does Judea, or rather was\nformerly under the same government.\" And this is what Strabo says.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Dr. Hudson observes, that the name of this wife of Antipater in Josephus\nwas Cypros, as a Hebrew termination, but not Cypris, the Greek name for\nVenus, as some critics were ready to correct it."}, "#text": "So when Crassus had settled all things as he himself pleased, he\nmarched into Parthia, where both he himself and all his army perished,\nas hath been related elsewhere.

But Aristobulus had no enjoyment of what he hoped for\nfrom the power that was given him by Cesar; for those of Pompey's party\nprevented it, and destroyed him by poison; and those of Caesar's party\nburied him. His dead body also lay, for a good while, embalmed in honey,\ntill Antony afterward sent it to Judea, and caused him to be buried in\nthe royal sepulcher. But Scipio, upon Pompey's sending to him to slay Alexander,\nthe son of Aristobulus, because the young man was accused of what offenses\nhe had been guilty of at first against the Romans, cut off his head; and\nthus did he die at Antioch. But Ptolemy, the son of Menneus, who was the\nruler of Chalcis, under Mount Libanus, took his brethren to him, and sent\nhis son Philippion to Askelon to Aristobulus's wife, and desired her to\nsend back with him her son Antigonus, and her daughters; the one of which,\nwhose name was Alexandra, Philippion fell in love with, and married her,\nthough afterward his father Ptolemy slew him, and married Alexandra, and\ncontinued to take care of her brethren.", "NOW after Pompey was dead, and after that victory Caesar had gained\nover him, Antipater, who managed the Jewish affairs, became very useful\nto Caesar when he made war against Egypt, and that by the order of Hyrcanus;\nfor when Mithridates of Pergainus was bringing his auxiliaries, and was\nnot able to continue his march through Pelusium, but obliged to stay at\nAskelon, Antipater came to him, conducting three thousand of the Jews,\narmed men. He had also taken care the principal men of the Arabians should\ncome to his assistance; and on his account it was that all the Syrians\nassisted him also, as not willing to appear behindhand in their alacrity\nfor Cesar, viz. Jamblicus the ruler, and Ptolemy his son, and Tholomy the\nson of Sohemus, who dwelt at Mount Libanus, and almost all the cities.\nSo Mithridates marched out of Syria, and came to Pelusium; and when its\ninhabitants would not admit him, he besieged the city. Now Antipater signalized\nhimself here, and was the first who plucked down a part of the wall, and\nso opened a way to the rest, whereby they might enter the city, and by\nthis means Pelusium was taken. But it happened that the Egyptian Jews,\nwho dwelt in the country called Onion, would not let Antipater and Mithridates,\nwith their soldiers, pass to Caesar; but Antipater persuaded them to come\nover with their party, because he was of the same people with them, and\nthat chiefly by showing them the epistles of Hyrcanus the high priest,\nwherein he exhorted them to cultivate friendship with Caesar, and to supply\nhis army with money, and all sorts of provisions which they wanted; and\naccordingly, when they saw Antipater and the high priest of the same sentiments,\nthey did as they were desired. And when the Jews about Memphis heard that\nthese Jews were come over to Caesar, they also invited Mithridates to come\nto them; so he came and received them also into his army.", "And when Mithridates had gone over all Delta, as the place is called,\nhe came to a pitched battle with the enemy, near the place called the Jewish\nCamp. Now Mithridates had the right wing, and Antipater the left; and when\nit came to a fight, that wing where Mithridates was gave way, and was likely\nto suffer extremely, unless Antipater had come running to him with his\nown soldiers along the shore, when he had already beaten the enemy that\nopposed him; so he delivered Mithridates, and put those Egyptians who had\nbeen too hard for him to flight. He also took their camp, and continued\nin the pursuit of them. He also recalled Mithridates, who had been worsted,\nand was retired a great way off; of whose soldiers eight hundred fell,\nbut of Antipater's fifty. So Mithridates sent an account of this battle\nto Caesar, and openly declared that Antipater was the author of this victory,\nand of his own preservation, insomuch that Caesar commended Antipater then,\nand made use of him all the rest of that war in the most hazardous undertakings;\nhe happened also to be wounded in one of those engagements", "However, when Caesar, after some time, had finished that war, and\nwas sailed away for Syria, he honored Antipater greatly, and confirmed\nHyrcanus in the high priesthood; and bestowed on Antipater the privilege\nof a citizen of Rome, and a freedom from taxes every where; and it is reported\nby many, that Hyrcanus went along with Antipater in this expedition, and\ncame himself into Egypt. And Strabo of Cappadocia bears witness to this,\nwhen he says thus, in the name of Aslnius: \"After Mithridates had\ninvaded Egypt, and with him Hyrcanus the high priest of the Jews.\"\nNay, the same Strabo says thus again, in another place, in the name of\nHypsicrates, that \"Mithridates at first went out alone; but that Antipater,\nwho had the care of the Jewish affairs, was called by him to Askelon, and\nthat he had gotten ready three thousand soldiers to go along with him,\nand encouraged other governors of the country to go along with him also;\nand that Hyrcanus the high priest was also present in this expedition.\"\nThis is what Strabo says.", "But Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus, came at this time to Caesar,\nand lamented his father's fate; and complained, that it was by Antipater's\nmeans that Aristobulus was taken off by poison, and his brother was beheaded\nby Scipio, and desired that he would take pity of him who had been ejected\nout of that principality which was due to him. He also accused Hyrcanus\nand Antipater as governing the nation by violence, and offering injuries\nto himself. Antipater was present, and made his defense as to the accusations\nthat were laid against him. He demonstrated that Antigonus and his party\nwere given to innovation, and were seditious persons. He also put Caesar\nin mind what difficult services he had undergone when he assisted him in\nhis wars, and discoursed about what he was a witness of himself. He added,\nthat Aristobulus was justly carried away to Rome, as one that was an enemy\nto the Romans, and could never be brought to be a friend to them, and that\nhis brother had no more than he deserved from Scipio, as being seized in\ncommitting robberies; and that this punishment was not inflicted on him\nin a way of violence or injustice by him that did it.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Take Dr. Hudson's note upon this place, which I suppose to be the truth:\n\"Here is some mistake in Josephus; for when he had promised us a decree\nfor the restoration of Jerusalem he brings in a decree of far greater antiquity,\nand that a league of friendship and union only.

Accordingly he came; but his\nfather had persuaded him to come not like a private man, but with a guard,\nfor the security of his person; and that when he had settled the affairs\nof Galilee in the best manner he could for his own advantage, he should\ncome to his trial, but still with a body of men sufficient for his security\non his journey, yet so that he should not come with so great a force as\nmight look like terrifying Hyrcanus, but still such a one as might not\nexpose him naked and unguarded [to his enemies.] However, Sextus Caesar,\npresident of Syria, wrote to Hyrcanus, and desired him to clear Herod,\nand dismiss him at his trial, and threatened him beforehand if he did not\ndo it.

But when Herod stood before the Sanhedrim, with his body of men about\nhim, he aftrighted them all, and no one of his former accusers durst after\nthat bring any charge against him, but there was a deep silence, and nobody\nknew what was to be done. When affairs stood thus, one whose name was Sameas,\n\na righteous man he was, and for that reason above all fear, rose up, and\nsaid, \"O you that are assessors with me, and O thou that art our king,\nI neither have ever myself known such a case, nor do I suppose that any\none of you can name its parallel, that one who is called to take his trial\nby us ever stood in such a manner before us; but every one, whosoever he\nbe, that comes to be tried by this Sanhedrim, presents himself in a submissive\nmanner, and like one that is in fear of himself, and that endeavors to\nmove us to compassion, with his hair dishevelled, and in a black and mourning\ngarment: but this admirable man Herod, who is accused of murder, and called\nto answer so heavy an accusation, stands here clothed in purple, and with\nthe hair of his head finely trimmed, and with his armed men about him,\nthat if we shall condemn him by our law, he may slay us, and by overbearing\njustice may himself escape death. Yet do not I make this complaint against\nHerod himself; he is to be sure more concerned for himself than for the\nlaws; but my complaint is against yourselves, and your king, who gave him\na license so to do. However, take you notice, that God is great, and that\nthis very man, whom you are going to absolve and dismiss, for the sake\nof Hyrcanus, will one day punish both you and your king himself also.\"\nNor did Sameas mistake in any part of this prediction; for when Herod had\nreceived the kingdom, he slew all the members of this Sanhedrim, and Hyrcanus\nhimself also, excepting Sameas, for he had a great honor for him on account\nof his righteousness, and because, when the city was afterward besieged\nby Herod and Sosius, he persuaded the people to admit Herod into it; and\ntold them that for their sins they would not be able to escape his hands:\n- which things will be related by us in their proper places."}, "But when Hyrcanus saw that the members of the Sanhedrim were ready\nto pronounce the sentence of death upon Herod, he put off the trial to\nanother day, and sent privately to Herod, and advised him to fly out of\nthe city, for that by this means he might escape. So he retired to Damascus,\nas though he fled from the king; and when he had been with Sextus Caesar,\nand had put his own affairs in a sure posture, he resolved to do thus;\nthat in case he were again summoned before the Sanhedrim to take his trial,\nhe would not obey that summons. Hereupon the members of the Sanhedrim had\ngreat indignation at this posture of affairs, and endeavored to persuade\nHyrcanus that all these things were against him; which state of matters\nhe was not ignorant of; but his temper was so unmanly, and so foolish,\nthat he was able to do nothing at all. But when Sextus had made Herod general\nof the army of Celesyria, for he sold him that post for money, Hyrcanus\nwas in fear lest Herod should make war upon him; nor was the effect of\nwhat he feared long in coming upon him; for Herod came and brought an army\nalong with him to fight with Hyrcanus, as being angry at the trial he bad\nbeen summoned to undergo before the Sanhedrim; but his father Antipater,\nand his brother [Phasaelus], met him, and hindered him from assaulting\nJerusalem. They also pacified his vehement temper, and persuaded him to\ndo no overt action, but only to affright them with threatenings, and to\nproceed no further against one who had given him the dignity he had: they\nalso desired him not only to be angry that he was summoned, and obliged\nto come to his trial, but to remember withal how he was dismissed without\ncondemnation, and how he ought to give Hyrcanus thanks for the same; and\nthat he was not to regard only what was disagreeable to him, and be unthankful\nfor his deliverance. So they desired him to consider, that since it is\nGod that turns the scales of war, there is great uncertainty in the issue\nof battles, and that therefore he ought of to expect the victory when he\nshould fight with his king, and him that had supported him, and bestowed\nmany benefits upon him, and had done nothing itself very severe to him;\nfor that his accusation, which was derived from evil counselors, and not\nfrom himself, had rather the suspicion of some severity, than any thing\nreally severe in it.

He then went over the cities,\nand got together weapons and soldiers, and laid great taxes upon those\ncities; and he chiefly oppressed Judea, and exacted of it seven hundred\ntalents: but Antipater, when he saw the state to be in so great consternation\nand disorder, he divided the collection of that sum, and appointed his\ntwo sons to gather it; and so that part of it was to be exacted by Malichus,\nwho was ill-disposed to him, and part by others. And because Herod did\nexact what is required of him from Galilee before others, he was in the\ngreatest favor with Cassius; for he thought it a part of prudence to cultivate\na friendship with the Romans, and to gain their goodwill at the expense\nof others; whereas the curators of the other cities, with their citizens,\nwere sold for slaves; and Cassius reduced four cities into a state of slavery,\nthe two most potent of which were Gophna and Emmaus; and, besides these,\nLydia and Thamna. Nay, Cassius was so very angry at Malichus, that he had\nkilled him, (for he assaulted him,) had not Hyrcanus, by the means of Antipater,\nsent him a hundred talents of his own, and thereby pacified his anger against\nhim.", "But after Cassius was gone out of Judea, Malichus laid snares for\nAntipater, as thinking that his death would-be the preservation of Hyrcanus's\ngovernment; but his design was not unknown to Antipater, which when he\nperceived, he retired beyond Jordan, and got together an army, partly of\nArabs, and partly of his own countrymen. However, Malichus, being one of\ngreat cunning, denied that he had laid any snares for him, and made his\ndefense with an oath, both to himself and his sons; and said that while\nPhasaelus had a garrison in Jerusalem, and Herod had the weapons of war\nin his custody, he could never have a thought of any such thing. So Antipater,\nperceiving the distress that Malichus was in, was reconciled to him, and\nmade an agreement with him: this was when Marcus was president of Syria;\nwho yet perceiving that this Malichus was making a disturbance in Judea,\nproceeded so far that he had almost killed him; but still, at the intercession\nof Antipater, he saved him.", "However, Antipater little thought that by saving Malichus he had\nsaved his own murderer; for now Cassius and Marcus had got together an\narmy, and intrusted the entire care of it with Herod, and made him general\nof the forces of Celesyria, and gave him a fleet of ships, and an army\nof horsemen and footmen; and promised him, that after the war was over\nthey would make him king of Judea; for a war was already begun between\nAntony and the younger Caesar: but as Malichus was most afraid of Antipater,\nhe took him out of the way; and by the offer of money, persuaded the butler\nof Hyrcanus, with whom they were both to feast, to kill him by poison.\nThis being done, and he having armed men with him, settled the affairs\nof the city. But when Antipater's sons, Herod and Phasaelus, were acquainted\nwith this conspiracy against their father, and had indignation at it, Malichus\ndenied all, and utterly renounced any knowledge of the murder. And thus\ndied Antipater, a man that had distinguished himself for piety and justice,\nand love to his country. And whereas one of his sons, Herod, resolved immediately\nto revenge their father's death, and was coming upon Malichus with an army\nfor that purpose, the elder of his sons, Phasaelus, thought it best rather\nto get this man into their hands by policy, lest they should appear to\nbegin a civil war in the country; so he accepted of Malichus's defense\nfor himself, and pretended to believe him that he had had no hand in the\nviolent death of Antipater his father, but erected a fine monument for\nhim. Herod also went to Samaria; and when he found them in great distress,\nhe revived their spirits, and composed their differences.", "However, a little after this, Herod, upon the approach of a festival,\ncame with his soldiers into the city; whereupon Malichus was aftrighted,\nand persuaded Hyrcanus not to permit him to come into the city. Hyrcanus\ncomplied; and, for a pretense of excluding him, alleged, that a rout of\nstrangers ought not to be admitted when the multitude were purifying themselves.\nBut Herod had little regard to the messengers that were sent to him, and\nentered the city in the night time, and aftrighted Malichus; yet did he\nremit nothing of his former dissimulation, but wept for Antipater, and\nbewailed him as a friend of his with a loud voice; but Herod and his friends\nthough, it proper not openly to contradict Malichus's hypocrisy, but to\ngive him tokens of mutual friendship, in order to prevent his suspicion\nof them.", "However, Herod sent to Cassius, and informed him of the murder of\nhis father; who knowing what sort of man Malichus was as to his morals,\nsent him back word that he should revenge his father's death; and also\nsent privately to the commanders of his army at Tyre, with orders to assist\nHerod in the execution of a very just design of his. Now when Cassius had\ntaken Laodicea, they all went together to him, and carried him garlands\nand money; and Herod thought that Malichus might be punished while he was\nthere; but he was somewhat apprehensive of the thing, and designed to make\nsome great attempt, and because his son was then a hostage at Tyre, he\nwent to that city, and resolved to steal him away privately, and to march\nthence into Judea; and as Cassius was in haste to march against Antony,\nhe thought to bring the country to revolt, and to procure the government\nfor himself. But Providence opposed his counsels; and Herod being a shrewd\nman, and perceiving what his intention was, he sent thither beforehand\na servant, in appearance indeed to get a supper ready, for he had said\nbefore that he would feast them all there, but in reality to the commanders\nof the army, whom he persuaded to go out against Malichus, with their daggers.\nSo they went out and met the man near the city, upon the sea-shore, and\nthere stabbed him. Whereupon Hyrcanus was so astonished at what had happened,\nthat his speech failed him; and when, after some difficulty, he had recovered\nhimself, he asked Herod what the matter could be, and who it was that slew\nMalichus; and when he said that it was done by the command of Cassius,\nhe commended the action; for that Malichus was a very wicked man, and one\nthat conspired against his own country. And this was the punishment that\nwas inflicted on Malichus for what he wickedly did to Antipater.", "But when Cassius was marched out of Syria, disturbances arose in\nJudea; for Felix, who was left at Jerusalem with an army, made a sudden\nattempt against Phasaelus, and the people themselves rose in arms; but\nHerod went to Fabius, the prefect of Damascus, and was desirous to run\nto his brother's assistance, but was hindered by a distemper that seized\nupon him, till Phasaelus by himself had been too hard for Felix, and had\nshut him up in the tower, and there, on certain conditions, dismissed him.\nPhasaelus also complained of Hyrcanus, that although he had received a\ngreat many benefits from them, yet did he support their enemies; for Malichus's\nbrother had made many places to revolt, and kept garrisons in them, and\nparticularly Masada, the strongest fortress of them all.

But when those that were adversaries to you,\nand to the Roman people, abstained neither from cities nor temples, and\ndid not observe the agreement they had confirmed by oath, it was not only\non account of our contest with them, but on account of all mankind in common,\nthat we have taken vengeance on those who have been the authors of great\ninjustice towards men, and of great wickedness towards the gods; for the\nsake of which we suppose it was that the sun turned away his light from\nus, \nas unwilling to view the horrid crime they were guilty of in the case of\nCaesar. We have also overcome their conspiracies, which threatened the\ngods themselves, which Macedonia received, as it is a climate peculiarly\nproper for impious and insolent attempts; and we have overcome that confused\nrout of men, half mad with spite against us, which they got together at\nPhilippi in Macedonia, when they seized on the places that were proper\nfor their purpose, and, as it were, walled them round with mountains to\nthe very sea, and where the passage was open only through a single gate.\nThis victory we gained, because the gods had condemned those men for their\nwicked enterprises. Now Brutus, when he had fled as far as Philippi, was\nshut up by us, and became a partaker of the same perdition with Cassius;\nand now these have received their punishment, we suppose that we may enjoy\npeace for the time to come, and that Asia may be at rest from war.

But they did not\nacquiesce; whereupon the Romans ran upon them with their daggers, and slew\nsome, and wounded more of them, and the rest fled away and went home, and\nlay still in great consternation.

Now Antigonus had promised to give the Parthians\na thousand talents, and five hundred women, upon condition they would take\nthe government away from Hyrcanus, and bestow it upon him, and withal kill\nHerod. And although he did not give them what he had promised, yet did\nthe Parthians make an expedition into Judea on that account, and carried\nAntigonus with them. Pacorus went along the maritime parts, but the commander\nBarzapharnes through the midland. Now the Tyrians excluded Pacorus, but\nthe Sidontans and those of Ptolemais received him. However, Pacorus sent\na troop of horsemen into Judea, to take a view of the state of the country,\nand to assist Antigonus; and sent also the king's butler, of the same name\nwith himself. So when the Jews that dwelt about Mount Carmel came to Antigonus,\nand were ready to march with him into Judea, Antigonus hoped to get some\npart of the country by their assistance. The place is called Drymi; and\nwhen some others came and met them, the men privately fell upon Jerusalem;\nand when some more were come to them, they got together in great numbers,\nand came against the king's palace, and besieged it. But as Phasaelus's\nand Herod's party came to the other's assistance, and a battle happened\nbetween them in the market-place, the young men beat their enemies, and\npursued them into the temple, and sent some armed men into the adjoining\nhouses to keep them in, who yet being destitute of such as should support\nthem, were burnt, and the houses with them, by the people who rose up against\nthem. But Herod was revenged on these seditious adversaries of his a little\nafterward for this injury they had offered him, when he fought with them,\nand slew a great number of them.", "But while there were daily skirmishes, the enemy waited for the coming\nof the multitude out of the country to Pentecost, a feast of ours so called;\nand when that day was come, many ten thousands of the people were gathered\ntogether about the temple, some in armor, and some without. Now those that\ncame guarded both the temple and the city, excepting what belonged to the\npalace, which Herod guarded with a few of his soldiers; and Phasaelus had\nthe charge of the wall, while Herod, with a body of his men, sallied out\nupon the enemy, who lay in the suburbs, and fought courageously, and put\nmany ten thousands to flight, some flying into the city, and some into\nthe temple, and some into the outer fortifications, for some such fortifications\nthere were in that place. Phasaelus came also to his assistance; yet was\nPacorus, the general of the Parthians, at the desire of Antigonus, admitted\ninto the city, with a few of his horsemen, under pretence indeed as if\nhe would still the sedition, but in reality to assist Antigonus in obtaining\nthe government. And when Phasaelus met him, and received him kindly, Pacorus\npersuaded him to go himself as ambassador to Barzapharnes, which was done\nfraudulently. Accordingly, Phasaelus, suspecting no harm, complied with\nhis proposal, while Herod did not give his consent to what was done, because\nof the perfidiousness of these barbarians, but desired Phasaelus rather\nto fight those that were come into the city.", {"emph": "freemen", "#text": "So both Hyrcanus and Phasaelus went on the embassage; but Pacorus\nleft with Herod two hundred horsemen, and ten men, who were called the\n, and conducted the others on their journey; and when they\nwere in Galilee, the governors of the cities there met them in their arms.\nBarzaphanles also received them at the first with cheerfulness, and made\nthem presents, though he afterward conspired against them; and Phasaelus,\nwith his horsemen, were conducted to the sea-side. But when they heard\nthat Antigonus had promised to give the Parthians a thousand talents, and\nfive hundred women, to assist him against them, they soon had a suspicion\nof the barbarians. Moreover, there was one who informed them that snares\nwere laid for them by night, while a guard came about them secretly; and\nthey had then been seized upon, had not they waited for the seizure of\nHerod by the Parthians that were about Jerusalem, lest, upon the slaughter\nof Hyrcanus and Phasaelus, he should have an intimation of it, and escape\nout of their hands. And these were the circumstances they were now in;\nand they saw who they were that guarded them. Some persons indeed would\nhave persuaded Phasaelus to fly away immediately on horseback, and not\nstay any longer; and there was one Ophellius, who, above all the rest,\nwas earnest with him to do so; for he had heard of this treachery from\nSaramalla, the richest of all the Syrians at that time, who also promised\nto provide him ships to carry him off; for the sea was just by them. But\nhe had no mind to desert Hyrcanus, nor bring his brother into danger; but\nhe went to Barzapharnes, and told him he did not act justly when he made\nsuch a contrivance against them; for that if he wanted money, he would\ngive him more than Antigonus; and besides, that it was a horrible thing\nto slay those that came to him upon the security of their oaths, and that\nwhen they had done them no injury. But the barbarian swore to him that\nthere was no truth in any of his suspicions, but that he was troubled with\nnothing but false proposals, and then went away to Pacorus."}, "But as soon as he was gone away, some men came and bound Hyrcanus\nand Phasaelus, while Phasaelus greatly reproached the Parthians for their\nperjury; However, that butler who was sent against Herod had it in command\nto get him without the walls of the city, and seize upon him; but messengers\nhad been sent by Phasaelus to inform Herod of the perfidiousness of the\nParthians. And when he knew that the enemy had seized upon them, he went\nto Pacorus, and to the most potent of the Parthians, as to the lord of\nthe rest, who, although they knew the whole matter, dissembled with him\nin a deceitful way; and said that he ought to go out with them before the\nwalls, and meet those which were bringing him his letters, for that they\nwere not taken by his adversaries, but were coming to give him an account\nof the good success Phasaelus had had. Herod did not give credit to what\nthey said; for he had heard that his brother was seized upon by others\nalso; and the daughter of Hyrcanus, whose daughter he had espoused, was\nhis monitor also [not to credit them], which made him still more suspicious\nof the Parthians; for although other people did not give heed to her, yet\ndid he believe her as a woman of very great wisdom.", "Now while the Parthians were in consultation what was fit to be done;\nfor they did not think it proper to make an open attempt upon a person\nof his character; and while they put off the determination to the next\nday, Herod was under great disturbance of mind, and rather inclining to\nbelieve the reports he heard about his brother and the Parthians, than\nto give heed to what was said on the other side, he determined, that when\nthe evening came on, he would make use of it for his flight, and not make\nany longer delay, as if the dangers from the enemy were not yet certain.\nHe therefore removed with the armed men whom he had with him; and set his\nwives upon the beasts, as also his mother, and sister, and her whom he\nwas about to marry, [Mariamne,] the daughter of Alexander, the son of Aristobulus,\nwith her mother, the daughter of Hyrcanus, and his youngest brother, and\nall their servants, and the rest of the multitude that was with him, and\nwithout the enemy's privity pursued his way to Idumea. Nor could any enemy\nof his who then saw him in this case be so hardhearted, but would have\ncommiserated his fortune, while the women drew along their infant children\nand left their own country, and their friends in prison, with tears in\ntheir eyes, and sad lamentations, and in expectation of nothing but what\nwas of a melancholy nature.", "But for Herod himself, he raised his mind above the miserable state\nhe was in, and was of good courage in the midst of his misfortunes; and\nas he passed along, he bid them every one to be of good cheer, and not\nto give themselves up to sorrow, because that would hinder them in their\nflight, which was now the only hope of safety that they had. Accordingly,\nthey tried to bear with patience the calamity they were under, as he exhorted\nthem to do; yet was he once almost going to kill himself, upon the overthrow\nof a waggon, and the danger his mother was then in of being killed; and\nthis on two accounts, because of his great concern for her, and because\nhe was afraid lest, by this delay, the enemy should overtake him in the\npursuit: but as he was drawing his sword, and going to kill himself therewith,\nthose that were present restrained him, and being so many in number, were\ntoo hard for him; and told him that he ought not to desert them, and leave\nthem a prey to their enemies, for that it was not the part of a brave man\nto free himself from the distresses he was in, and to overlook his friends\nthat were in the same distresses also. So he was compelled to let that\nhorrid attempt alone, partly out of shame at what they said to him, and\npartly out of regard to the great number of those that would not permit\nhim to do what he intended. So he encouraged his mother, and took all the\ncare of her the time would allow, and proceeded on the way he proposed\nto go with the utmost haste, and that was to the fortress of Masada. And\nas he had many skirmishes with such of the Parthians as attacked him and\npursued him, he was conqueror in them all.", "Nor indeed was he free from the Jews all along as he was in his flight;\nfor by that time he was gotten sixty furlongs out of the city, and was\nupon the road, they fell upon him, and fought hand to hand with him, whom\nhe also put to flight, and overcame, not like one that was in distress\nand in necessity, but like one that was excellently prepared for war, and\nhad what he wanted in great plenty. And in this very place where he overcame\nthe Jews it was that he some time afterward build a most excellent palace,\nand a city round about it, and called it Herodium. And when he was come\nto Idumea, at a place called Thressa, his brother Joseph met him, and he\nthen held a council to take advice about all his affairs, and what was\nfit to be done in his circumstances, since he had a great multitude that\nfollowed him, besides his mercenary soldiers, and the place Masada, whither\nhe proposed to fly, was too small to contain so great a multitude; so he\nsent away the greater part of his company, being above nine thousand, and\nbid them go, some one way, and some another, and so save themselves in\nIdumea, and gave them what would buy them provisions in their journey.\nBut he took with him those that were the least encumbered, and were most\nintimate with him, and came to the fortress, and placed there his wives\nand his followers, being eight hundred in number, there being in the place\na sufficient quantity of corn and water, and other necessaries, and went\ndirectly for Petra, in Arabia. But when it was day, the Parthians plundered\nall Jerusalem, and the palace, and abstained from nothing but Hyrcanus's\nmoney, which was three hundred talents. A great deal of Herod's money escaped,\nand principally all that the man had been so provident as to send into\nIdumea beforehand; nor indeed did what was in the city suffice the Parthians,\nbut they went out into the country, and plundered it, and demolished the\ncity Marissa.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This law of Moses, that the priests were to be \"without blemish,\"\nas to all the parts of their bodies, is in Leviticus 21:17-24"}, "#text": "And thus was Antigonus brought back into Judea by the king of the\nParthians, and received Hyrcanus and Phasaelus for his prisoners; but he\nwas greatly cast down because the women had escaped, whom he intended to\nhave given the enemy, as having promised they should have them, with the\nmoney, for their reward: but being afraid that Hyrcanus, who was under\nthe guard of the Parthians, might have his kingdom restored to him by the\nmultitude, he cut off his ears, and thereby took care that the high priesthood\nshould never come to him any more, because he was maimed, while the law\nrequired that this dignity should belong to none but such as had all their\nmembers entire \nBut now one cannot but here admire the fortitude of Phasaelus, who, perceiving\nthat he was to be put to death, did not think death any terrible thing\nat all; but to die thus by the means of his enemy, this he thought a most\npitiable and dishonorable thing; and therefore, since he had not his hands\nat liberty, but the bonds he was in prevented him from killing himself\nthereby, he dashed his head against a great stone, and thereby took away\nhis own life, which he thought to be the best thing he could do in such\na distress as he was in, and thereby put it out of the power of the enemy\nto bring him to any death he pleased. It is also reported, that when he\nhad made a great wound in his head, Antigonus sent physicians to cure it,\nand, by ordering them to infuse poison into the wound, killed him.

He\nalso built there a three-decked ship, and set sail thence, with his friends,\nfor Italy, and came to the port of Brundusium; and when he was come from\nthence to Rome, he first related to Antony what had befallen him in Judea,\nand how Phasaelus his brother was seized on by the Parthians, and put to\ndeath by them, and how Hyrcanus was detained captive by them, and how they\nhad made Antigonus king, who had promised them a sum of money, no less\nthan a thousand talents, with five hundred women, who were to be of the\nprincipal families, and of the Jewish stock; and that he had carried off\nthe women by night; and that, by undergoing a great many hardships, he\nhad escaped the hands of his enemies; as also, that his own relations were\nin danger of being besieged and taken, and that he had sailed through a\nstorm, and contemned all these terrible dangers of it, in order to come,\nas soon as possible, to him, who was his hope and only succor at this time."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Concerning the chronology of Herod, and the time when he was first made\nking at Rome, and concerning the time when he began his second reign, without\na rival, upon the conquest and slaughter of Antigonus, both principally\nderived from this and the two next chapters in Josephus, see the note on\nsect. 6, and ch. 15. sect. 10."}, "#text": "This account made Antony commiserate the change that had happened\nin Herod's condition; \nand reasoning with himself that this was a common case among those that\nare placed in such great dignities, and that they are liable to the mutations\nthat come from fortune, he was very ready to give him the assistance he\ndesired, and this because he called to mind the friendship he had had with\nAntipater because Herod offered him money to make him king, as he had formerly\ngiven it him to make him tetrarch, and chiefly because of his hatred to\nAntigonus; for he took him to be a seditious person, and an enemy to the\nRomans. Caesar was also the forwarder to raise Herod's dignity, and to\ngive him his assistance in what he desired, on account of the toils of\nwar which he had himself undergone with Antipater his father in Egypt,\nand of the hospitality he had treated him withal, and the kindness he had\nalways showed him, as also to gratify Antony, who was very zealous for\nHerod. So a senate was convocated; and Messala first, and then Atratinus,\nintroduced Herod into it, and enlarged upon the benefits they had received\nfrom his father, and put them in mind of the good-will he had borne to\nthe Romans.

This\nyoung man [the grandson] Herod afterward took care to have slain, as we\nshall show in its proper place. But when the senate was dissolved, Antony\nand Caesar went out of the senate house with Herod between them, and with\nthe consuls and other magistrates before them, in order to offer sacrifices,\nand to lay up their decrees in the capitol.

However, as Herod went along his army increased every day, and\nall Galilee, with some small exception, joined him; but as he was to those\nthat were in Masada, (for he was obliged to endeavor to save those that\nwere in that fortress now they were besieged, because they were his relations,)\nJoppa was a hinderance to him, for it was necessary for him to take that\nplace first, it being a city at variance with him, that no strong hold\nmight be left in his enemies' hands behind him when he should go to Jerusalem.\nAnd when Silo made this a pretense for rising up from Jerusalem, and was\nthereupon pursued by the Jews, Herod fell upon them with a small body of\nmen, and both put the Jews to flight and saved Silo, when he was very poorly\nable to defend himself; but when Herod had taken Joppa, he made haste to\nset free those of his family that were in Masada. Now of the people of\nthe country, some joined him because of the friendship they had had with\nhis father, and some because of the splendid appearance he made, and others\nby way of requital for the benefits they had received from both of them;\nbut the greatest number came to him in hopes of getting somewhat from him\nafterward, if he were once firmly settled in the kingdom.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This affirmation of Antigonus, spoken in the days of Herod, and in a manner\nto his face, that he was an Idumean, i.e. a half Jew, seems to me of much\ngreater authority than that pretense of his favorite and flatterer Nicolaus\nof Damascus, that he derived his pedigree from Jews as far backward as\nthe Babylonish captivity, ch. 1. sect. 3. Accordingly Josephus always esteems\nhim an Idumean, though he says his father Antipater was of the same people\nwith the Jews, ch. viii. sect. 1. and by birth a Jew, Antiq. B.

So Herod received\nthose of his family out of Masada, and the fortress Ressa, and then went\non for Jerusalem. The soldiery also that was with Silo accompanied him\nall along, as did many of the citizens, being afraid of his power; and\nas soon as he had pitched his camp on the west side of the city, the soldiers\nthat were set to guard that part shot their arrows and threw their darts\nat him; and when some sallied out in a crowd, and came to fight hand to\nhand with the first ranks of Herod's army, he gave orders that they should,\nin the first place, make proclamation about the wall, that he came for\nthe good of the people, and for the preservation of the city, and not to\nbear any old grudge at even his most open enemies, but ready to forget\nthe offenses which his greatest adversaries had done him. But Antigonus,\nby way of reply to what Herod had caused to be proclaimed, and this before\nthe Romans, and before Silo also, said that they would not do justly, if\nthey gave the kingdom to Herod, who was no more than a private man, and\nan Idumean, i.e. a half Jew, \nwhereas they ought to bestow it on one of the royal family, as their custom\nwas; for that in case they at present bear an ill-will to him, and had\nresolved to deprive him of the kingdom, as having received it from the\nParthians, yet were there many others of his family that might by their\nlaw take it, and these such as had no way offended the Romans; and being\nof the sacerdotal family, it would be an unworthy thing to put them by.\nNow while they said thus one to another, and fell to reproaching one another\non both sides, Antigonus permitted his own men that were upon the wall\nto defend themselves, who using their bows, and showing great alacrity\nagainst their enemies, easily drove them away from the towers."}, "And now it was that Silo discovered that he had taken bribes; for\nhe set a good number of his soldiers to complain aloud of the want of provisions\nthey were in, and to require money to buy them food; and that it was fit\nto let them go into places proper for winter quarters, since the places\nnear the city were a desert, by reason that Antigonus's soldiers had carried\nall away; so he set the army upon removing, and endeavored to march away;\nbut Herod pressed Silo not to depart, and exhorted Silo's captains and\nsoldiers not to desert him, when Caesar, and Antony, and the senate had\nsent him thither, for that he would provide them plenty of all the things\nthey wanted, and easily procure them a great abundance of what they required;\nafter which entreaty, he immediately went out into the country, and left\nnot the least pretense to Silo for his departure; for he brought an unexpected\nquantity of provisions, and sent to those friends of his who inhabited\nabout Samaria to bring down corn, and wine, and oil, and cattle, and all\nother provisions, to Jericho, that those might be no want of a supply for\nthe soldiers for the time to come. Antigonus was sensible of this, and\nsent presently over the country such as might restrain and lie in ambush\nfor those that went out for provisions. So these men obeyed the orders\nof Antigonus, and got together a great number of armed men about Jericho,\nand sat upon the mountains, and watched those that brought the provisions.\nHowever, Herod was not idle in the mean time, for he took ten bands of\nsoldiers, of whom five were of the Romans, and five of the Jews, with some\nmercenaries among them, and with some few horsemen, and came to Jericho;\nand as they found the city deserted, but that five hundred of them had\nsettled themselves on the tops of the hills, with their wives and children,\nthose he took and sent away; but the Romans fell upon the city, and plundered\nit, and found the houses full of all sorts of good things. So the king\nleft a garrison at Jericho, and came back again, and sent the Roman army\nto take their winter quarters in the countries that were come over to him,\nJudea, and Galilee, and Samaria. And so much did Antigonus gain of Silo\nfor the bribes he gave him, that part of the army should be quartered at\nLydda, in order to please Antony. So the Romans laid their weapons aside,\nand lived in plenty of all things.", "But Herod was not pleased with lying still, but sent out his brother\nJoseph against Idumea with two thousand armed footmen, and four hundred\nhorsemen, while he himself came to Samaria, and left his mother and his\nother relations there, for they were already gone out of Masada, and went\ninto Galilee, to take certain places which were held by the garrisons of\nAntigonus; and he passed on to Sepphoris, as God sent a snow, while Antigonus's\ngarrisons withdrew themselves, and had great plenty of provisions. He also\nwent thence, and resolved to destroy those robbers that dwelt in the caves,\nand did much mischief in the country; so he sent a troop of horsemen, and\nthree companies of armed footmen, against them. They were very near to\na village called Arbela; and on the fortieth day after, he came himself\nwith his whole army: and as the enemy sallied out boldly upon him, the\nleft wing of his army gave way; but he appearing with a body of men, put\nthose to flight who were already conquerors, and recalled his men that\nran away. He also pressed upon his enemies, and pursued them as far as\nthe river Jordan, though they ran away by different roads. So he brought\nover to him all Galilee, excepting those that dwelt in the caves, and distributed\nmoney to every one of his soldiers, giving them a hundred and fifty drachmae\napiece, and much more to their captains, and sent them into winter quarters;\nat which time Silo came to him, and his commanders with him, because Antigonus\nwould not give them provisions any longer, for he supplied them for no\nmore than one month; nay, he had sent to all the country about, and ordered\nthem to carry off the provisions that were there, and retire to the mountains,\nthat the Romans might have no provisions to live upon, and so might perish\nby famine. But Herod committed the care of that matter to Pheroras, his\nyoungest brother, and ordered him to repair Alexandrium also. Accordingly,\nhe quickly made the soldiers abound with great plenty of provisions, and\nrebuilt Alexandrium, which had been before desolate.", "About this time it was that Antony continued some time at Athens,\nand that Ventidius, who was now in Syria, sent for Silo, and commanded\nhim to assist Herod, in the first place, to finish the present war, and\nthen to send for their confederates for the war they were themselves engaged\nin; but as for Herod, he went in haste against the robbers that were in\nthe caves, and sent Silo away to Ventidius, while he marched against them.\nThese caves were in mountains that were exceeding abrupt, and in their\nmiddle were no other than precipices, with certain entrances into the caves,\nand those caves were encompassed with sharp rocks, and in these did the\nrobbers lie concealed, with all their families about them; but the king\ncaused certain chests to be made, in order to destroy them, and to be hung\ndown, bound about with iron chains, by an engine, from the top of the mountain,\nit being not possible to get up to them, by reason of the sharp ascent\nof the mountains, nor to creep down to them from above. Now these chests\nwere filled with armed men, who had long hooks in their hands, by which\nthey might pull out such as resisted them, and then tumble them down, and\nkill them by so doing; but the letting the chests down proved to be a matter\nof great danger, because of the vast depth they were to be let down, although\nthey had their provisions in the chests themselves. But when the chests\nwere let down, and not one of those in the mouths of the caves durst come\nnear them, but lay still out of fear, some of the armed men girt on their\narmor, and by both their hands took hold of the chain by which the chests\nwere let down, and went into the mouths of the caves, because they fretted\nthat such delay was made by the robbers not daring to come out of the caves;\nand when they were at any of those mouths, they first killed many of those\nthat were in the mouths with their darts, and afterwards pulled those to\nthem that resisted them with their hooks, and tumbled them down the precipices,\nand afterwards went into the caves, and killed many more, and then went\ninto their chests again, and lay still there; but, upon this, terror seized\nthe rest, when they heard the lamentations that were made, and they despaired\nof escaping. However, when the night came on, that put an end to the whole\nwork; and as the king proclaimed pardon by a herald to such as delivered\nthemselves up to him, many accepted of the offer. The same method of assault\nwas made use of the next day; and they went further, and got out in baskets\nto fight them, and fought them at their doors, and sent fire among them,\nand set their caves on fire, for there was a great deal of combustible\nmatter within them. Now there was one old man who was caught within one\nof these caves, with seven children and a wife; these prayed him to give\nthem leave to go out, and yield themselves up to the enemy; but he stood\nat the cave's mouth, and always slew that child of his who went out, till\nhe had destroyed them every one, and after that he slew his wife, and cast\ntheir dead bodies down the precipice, and himself after them, and so underwent\ndeath rather than slavery: but before he did this, he greatly reproached\nHerod with the meanness of his family, although he was then king. Herod\nalso saw what he was doing, and stretched out his hand, and offered him\nall manner of security for his life; by which means all these caves were\nat length subdued entirely.", "And when the king had set Ptolemy over these parts of the country\nas his general, he went to Samaria, with six hundred horsemen, and three\nthousand armed footmen, as intending to fight Antigonus. But still this\ncommand of the army did not succeed well with Ptolemy, but those that had\nbeen troublesome to Galilee before attacked him, and slew him; and when\nthey had done this, they fled among the lakes and places almost inaccessible\nlaying waste and plundering whatsoever they could come at in those places.\nBut Herod soon returned, and punished them for what they had done; for\nsome of these rebels he slew, and others of them, who had fled to the strong\nholds he besieged, and both slew them, and demolished their strong holds.\nAnd when he had thus put an end to their rebellion, he laid a fine upon\nthe cities of a hundred talents.", "In the mean time, Pacorus was fallen in a battle, and the Parthians\nwere defeated, when Ventidius sent Macheras to the assistance of Herod,\nwith two legions, and a thousand horsemen, while Antony encouraged him\nto make haste. But Macheras, at the instigation of Antigonus, without the\napprobation of Herod, as being corrupted by money, went about to take a\nview of his affairs; but Antigonus suspecting this intention of his coming,\ndid not admit him into the city, but kept him at a distance, with throwing\nstones at him, and plainly showed what he himself meant. But when Macheras\nwas sensible that Herod had given him good advice, and that he had made\na mistake himself in not hearkening to that advice, he retired to the city\nEmmaus; and what Jews he met with he slew them, whether they were enemies\nor friends, out of the rage he was in at what hardships he had undergone.\nThe king was provoked at this conduct of his, and went to Samaria, and\nresolved to go to Antony about these affairs, and to inform him that he\nstood in no need of such helpers, who did him more mischief than they did\nhis enemies; and that he was able of himself to beat Antigonus. But Macheras\nfollowed him, and desired that he would not go to Antony; or if he was\nresolved to go, that he would join his brother Joseph with them, and let\nthem fight against Antigonus. So he was reconciled to Macheras, upon his\nearnest entreaties. Accordingly, he left Joseph there with his army, but\ncharged him to run no hazards, nor to quarrel with Macheras.", "But for his own part, he made haste to Antony (who was then at the\nsiege of Samosata, a place upon Euphrates) with his troops, both horsemen\nand footmen, to be auxiliaries to him. And when he came to Antioch, and\nmet there a great number of men gotten together that were very desirous\nto go to Antony, but durst not venture to go, out of fear, because the\nbarbarians fell upon men on the road, and slew many, so he encouraged them,\nand became their conductor upon the road. Now when they were within two\ndays' march of Samosata, the barbarians had laid an ambush there to disturb\nthose that came to Antony, and where the woods made the passes narrow,\nas they led to the plains, there they laid not a few of their horsemen,\nwho were to lie still until those passengers were gone by into the wide\nplace. Now as soon as the first ranks were gone by, (for Herod brought\non the rear,) those that lay in ambush, who were about five hundred, fell\nupon them on the sudden, and when they had put the foremost to flight,\nthe king came riding hard, with the forces that were about him, and immediately\ndrove back the enemy; by which means he made the minds of his own men courageous,\nand imboldened them to go on, insomuch that those who ran away before now\nreturned back, and the barbarians were slain on all sides. The king also\nwent on killing them, and recovered all the baggage, among which were a\ngreat number of beasts for burden, and of slaves, and proceeded on in his\nmarch; and whereas there were a great number of those in the woods that\nattacked them, and were near the passage that led into the plain, he made\na sally upon these also with a strong body of men, and put them to flight,\nand slew many of them, and thereby rendered the way safe for those that\ncame after; and these called Herod their savior and protector.", "And when he was near to Samosata, Antony sent out his army in all\ntheir proper habiliments to meet him, in order to pay Herod this respect,\nand because of the assistance he had given him; for he had heard what attacks\nthe barbarians had made upon him [in Judea]. He also was very glad to see\nhim there, as having been made acquainted with the great actions he had\nperformed upon the road. So he entertained him very kindly, and could not\nbut admire his courage. Antony also embraced him as soon as he saw him,\nand saluted him after a most affectionate manner, and gave him the upper\nhand, as having himself lately made him a king; and in a little time Antiochus\ndelivered up the fortress, and on that account this war was at an end;\nthen Antony committed the rest to Sosius, and gave him orders to assist\nHerod, and went himself to Egypt. Accordingly, Sosius sent two legions\nbefore into Judea to the assistance of Herod, and he followed himself with\nthe body of the army.", "Now Joseph was already slain in Judea, in the manner following:\nHe forgot what charge his brother Herod had given him when he went to Antony;\nand when he had pitched his camp among the mountains, for Macheras had\nlent him five regiments, with these he went hastily to Jericho, in :order\nto reap the corn thereto belonging; and as the Roman regiments were but\nnewly raised, and were unskillful in war, for they were in great part collected\nout of Syria, he was attacked by the enemy, and caught in those places\nof difficulty, and was himself slain, as he was fighting bravely, and the\nwhole army was lost, for there were six regiments slain. So when Antigonus\nhad got possession of the dead bodies, he cut off Joseph's head, although\nPheroras his brother would have redeemed it at the price of fifty talents.\nAfter which defeat, the Galileans revolted from their commanders, and took\nthose of Herod's party, and drowned them in the lake, and a great part\nof Judea was become seditious; but Macheras fortified the place Gitta [in\nSamaria].", "At this time messengers came to Herod, and informed him of what\nhad been done; and when he was come to Daphne by Antioch, they told him\nof the ill fortune that had befallen his brother; which yet he expected,\nfrom certain visions that appeared to him in his dreams, which clearly\nforeshowed his brother's death. So he hastened his march; and when he came\nto Mount Libanus, he received about eight hundred of the men of that place,\nhaving already with him also one Roman legion, and with these he came to\nPtolemais. He also marched thence by night with his army, and proceeded\nalong Galilee. Here it was that the enemy met him, and fought him, and\nwere beaten, and shut up in the same place of strength whence they had\nsallied out the day before. So he attacked the place in the morning; but\nby reason of a great storm that was then very violent, he was able to do\nnothing, but drew off his army into the neighboring villages; yet as soon\nas the other legion that Antony sent him was come to his assistance, those\nthat were in garrison in the place were afraid, and deserted it in the\nnight time. Then did the king march hastily to Jericho, intending to avenge\nhimself on the enemy for the slaughter of his brother; and when he had\npitched his tents, he made a feast for the principal commanders; and after\nthis collation was over, and he had dismissed his guests, he retired to\nhis own chamber; and here may one see what kindness God had for the king,\nfor the upper part of the house fell down when nobody was in it, and so\nkilled none, insomuch that all the people believed that Herod was beloved\nof God, since he had escaped such a great and surprising danger.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "It may be worth our observation here, that these soldiers of Herod could\nnot have gotten upon the tops of these houses which were full of enemies,\nin order to pull up the upper floors, and destroy them beneath, but by\nladders from the out side; which illustrates some texts in the New Testament,\nby which it appears that men used to ascend thither by ladders on the outsides.\nSee Matthew 24:17; Mark 13:15; Luke 5:19; 17:31."}, "#text": "But the next day six thousand of the enemy came down from the tops\nof the mountains to fight the Romans, which greatly terrified them; and\nthe soldiers that were in light armor came near, and pelted the king's\nguards that were come out with darts and stones, and one of them hit him\non the side with a dart. Antigonus also sent a commander against Samaria,\nwhose name was Pappus, with some forces, being desirous to show the enemy\nhow potent he was, and that he had men to spare in his war with them. He\nsat down to oppose Macheras; but Herod, when he had taken five cities,\ntook such as were left in them, being about two thousand, and slew them,\nand burnt the cities themselves, and then returned to go against Pappus,\nwho was encamped at a village called Isanas; and there ran in to him many\nout of Jericho and Judea, near to which places he was, and the enemy fell\nupon his men, so stout were they at this time, and joined battle with them,\nbut he beat them in the fight; and in order to be revenged on them for\nthe slaughter of his brother, he pursued them sharply, and killed them\nas they ran away; and as the houses were full of armed men, \nand many of them ran as far as the tops of the houses, he got them under\nhis power, and pulled down the roofs of the houses, and saw the lower rooms\nfull of soldiers that were caught, and lay all on a heap; so they threw\nstones down upon them as they lay piled one upon another, and thereby killed\nthem; nor was there a more frightful spectacle in all the war than this,\nwhere beyond the walls an immense multitude of dead men lay heaped one\nupon another. This action it was which chiefly brake the spirits of the\nenemy, who expected now what would come; for there appeared a mighty number\nof people that came from places far distant, that were now about the village,\nbut then ran away; and had it not been for the depth of winter, which then\nrestrained them, the king's army had presently gone to Jerusalem, as being\nvery courageous at this good success, and the whole work had been done\nimmediately; for Antigonus was already looking about how he might fly away\nand leave the city."}, "At this time the king gave order that the soldiers should go to\nsupper, for it was late at night, while he went into a chamber to use the\nbath, for he was very weary; and here it was that he was in the greatest\ndanger, which yet, by God's providence, he escaped; for as he was naked,\nand had but one servant that followed him, to be with him while he was\nbathing in an inner room, certain of the enemy, who were in their armor,\nand had fled thither, out of fear, were then in the place; and as he was\nbathing, the first of them came out with his naked sword drawn, and went\nout at the doors, and after him a second, and a third, armed in like manner,\nand were under such a consternation, that they did no hurt to the king,\nand thought themselves to have come off very well ill suffering no harm\nthemselves in their getting out of the house. However, on the next day,\nhe cut off the head of Pappus, for he was already slain, and sent it to\nPheroras, as a punishment of what their brother had suffered by his means,\nfor he was the man that slew him with his own hand.", "When the rigor of winter was over, Herod removed his army, and came\nnear to Jerusalem, and pitched his camp hard by the city. Now this was\nthe third year since he had been made king at Rome; and as he removed his\ncamp, and came near that part of the wall where it could be most easily\nassaulted, he pitched that camp before the temple, intending to make his\nattacks in the same manner as did Pompey. So he encompassed the place with\nthree bulwarks, and erected towers, and employed a great many hands about\nthe work, and cut down the trees that were round about the city; and when\nhe had appointed proper persons to oversee the works, even while the army\nlay before the city, he himself went to Samaria, to complete his marriage,\nand to take to wife the daughter of Alexander, the son of Aristobulus;\nfor he had betrothed her already, as I have before related.", "AFTER the wedding was over, came Sosius through Phoenicia, having\nsent out his army before him over the midland parts. He also, who was their\ncommander, came himself, with a great number of horsemen and footmen. The\nking also came himself from Samaria, and brought with him no small army,\nbesides that which was there before, for they were about thirty thousand;\nand they all met together at the walls of Jerusalem, and encamped at the\nnorth wall of the city, being now an army of eleven legions, armed men\non foot, and six thousand horsemen, with other auxiliaries out of Syria.\nThe generals were two: Sosius, sent by Antony to assist Herod, and Herod\non his own account, in order to take the government from Antigonus, who\nwas declared all enemy at Rome, and that he might himself be king, according\nto the decree of the Senate.", "Now the Jews that were enclosed within the walls of the city fought\nagainst Herod with great alacrity and zeal (for the whole nation was gathered\ntogether); they also gave out many prophecies about the temple, and many\nthings agreeable to the people, as if God would deliver them out of the\ndangers they were in; they had also carried off what was out of the city,\nthat they might not leave any thing to afford sustenance either for men\nor for beasts; and by private robberies they made the want of necessaries\ngreater. When Herod understood this, he opposed ambushes in the fittest\nplaces against their private robberies, and he sent legions of armed men\nto bring its provisions, and that from remote places, so that in a little\ntime they had great plenty of provisions. Now the three bulwarks were easily\nerected, because so many hands were continually at work upon it; for it\nwas summer time, and there was nothing to hinder them in raising their\nworks, neither from the air nor from the workmen; so they brought their\nengines to bear, and shook the walls of the city, and tried all manner\nof ways to get its; yet did not those within discover any fear, but they\nalso contrived not a few engines to oppose their engines withal. They also\nsallied out, and burnt not only those engines that were not yet perfected,\nbut those that were; and when they came hand to hand, their attempts were\nnot less bold than those of the Romans, though they were behind them in\nskill. They also erected new works when the former were ruined, and making\nmines underground, they met each other, and fought there; and making use\nof brutish courage rather than of prudent valor, they persisted in this\nwar to the very last; and this they did while a mighty army lay round about\nthem, and while they were distressed by famine and the want of necessaries,\nfor this happened to be a Sabbatic year. The first that scaled the walls\nwere twenty chosen men, the next were Sosius's centurions; for the first\nwall was taken in forty days, and the second in fifteen more, when some\nof the cloisters that were about the temple were burnt, which Herod gave\nout to have been burnt by Antigonus, in order to expose him to the hatred\nof the Jews. And when the outer court of the temple and the lower city\nwere taken, the Jews fled into the inner court of the temple, and into\nthe upper city; but now fearing lest the Romans should hinder them from\noffering their daily sacrifices to God, they sent an embassage, and desired\nthat they would only permit them to bring in beasts for sacrifices, which\nHerod granted, hoping they were going to yield; but when he saw that they\ndid nothing of what he supposed, but bitterly opposed him, in order to\npreserve the kingdom to Antigonus, he made an assault upon the city, and\ntook it by storm; and now all parts were full of those that were slain,\nby the rage of the Romans at the long duration of the siege, and by the\nzeal of the Jews that were on Herod's side, who were not willing to leave\none of their adversaries alive; so they were murdered continually in the\nnarrow streets and in the houses by crowds, and as they were flying to\nthe temple for shelter, and there was no pity taken of either infants or\nthe aged, nor did they spare so much as the weaker sex; nay, although the\nking sent about, and besought them to spare the people, yet nobody restrained\ntheir hand from slaughter, but, as if they were a company of madmen, they\nfell upon persons of all ages, without distinction; and then Antigonus,\nwithout regard to either his past or present circumstances, came down from\nthe citadel, and fell down at the feet of Sosius, who took no pity of him,\nin the change of his fortune, but insulted him beyond measure, and called\nhim Antigone [i.e. a woman, and not a man;] yet did he not treat him as\nif he were a woman, by letting him go at liberty, but put him into bonds,\nand kept him in close custody.", "And now Herod having overcome his enemies, his care was to govern\nthose foreigners who had been his assistants, for the crowd of strangers\nrushed to see the temple, and the sacred things in the temple; but the\nking, thinking a victory to be a more severe affliction than a defeat,\nif any of those things which it was not lawful to see should be seen by\nthem, used entreaties and threatenings, and even sometimes force itself,\nto restrain them. He also prohibited the ravage that was made in the city,\nand many times asked Sosius whether the Romans would empty the city both\nof money and men, and leave him king of a desert; and told him that he\nesteemed the dominion over the whole habitable earth as by no means an\nequivalent satisfaction for such a murder of his citizens'; and when he\nsaid that this plunder was justly to be permitted the soldiers for the\nsiege they had undergone, he replied, that he would give every one their\nreward out of his own money; and by this means be redeemed what remained\nof the city from destruction; and he performed what he had promised him,\nfor he gave a noble present to every soldier, and a proportionable present\nto their commanders, but a most royal present to Sosius himself, till they\nall went away full of money.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Note here, that Josephus fully and frequently assures us that there passed\nabove three years between Herod's first obtaining the kingdom at Rome,\nand his second obtaining it upon the taking of Jerusalem and death of Antigonus.\nThe present history of this interval twice mentions the army going into\nwinter quarters, which perhaps belonged to two several winters, ch. 15.\nsect. 3, 4; and though Josephus says nothing how long they lay in those\nquarters, yet does he give such an account of the long and studied delays\nof Ventidius, Silo, and Macheras, who were to see Herod settled in his\nnew kingdom, but seem not to have had sufficient forces for that purpose,\nand were for certain all corrupted by Antigonus to make the longest delays\npossible, and gives us such particular accounts of the many great actions\nof Herod during the same interval, as fairly imply that interval, before\nHerod went to Samosata, to have been very considerable.

So when Sosius\nhad dedicated a crown of gold to God, he marched away from Jerusalem, and\ncarried Antigonus with him in bonds to Antony; but Herod was afraid lest\nAntigonus should be kept in prison [only] by Antony, and that when he was\ncarried to Rome by him, he might get his cause to be heard by the senate,\nand might demonstrate, as he was himself of the royal blood, and Herod\nbut a private man, that therefore it belonged to his sons however to have\nthe kingdom, on account of the family they were of, in case he had himself\noffended the Romans by what he had done. Out of Herod's fear of this it\nwas that he, by giving Antony a great deal of money, endeavored to persuade\nhim to have Antigonus slain, which if it were once done, he should be free\nfrom that fear. And thus did the government of the Asamoneans cease, a\nhundred twenty and six years after it was first set up. This family was\na splendid and an illustrious one, both on account of the nobility of their\nstock, and of the dignity of the high priesthood, as also for the glorious\nactions their ancestors had performed for our nation; but these men lost\nthe government by their dissensions one with another, and it came to Herod,\nthe son of Antipater, who was of no more than a vulgar family, and of no\neminent extraction, but one that was subject to other kings.

force; and besides that, how\nthey took Antigonus captive, has been related by us in the foregoing book.\nWe will now proceed in the narration. And since Herod had now the government\nof all Judea put into his hands, he promoted such of the private men in\nthe city as had been of his party, but never left off avenging and punishing\nevery day those that had chosen to be of the party of his enemies. But\nPollio the Pharisee, and Sameas, a disciple of his, were honored by him\nabove all the rest; for when Jerusalem was besieged, they advised the citizens\nto receive Herod, for which advice they were well requited. But this Pollio,\nat the time when Herod was once upon his trial of life and death, foretold,\nin way of reproach, to Hyrcanus and the other judges, how this Herod, whom\nthey suffered now to escape, would afterward inflict punishment on them\nall; which had its completion in time, while God fulfilled the words he\nhad spoken.", "At this time Herod, now he had got Jerusalem under his power, carried\noff all the royal ornaments, and spoiled the wealthy men of what they had\ngotten; and when, by these means, he had heaped together a great quantity\nof silver and gold, he gave it all to Antony, and his friends that were\nabout him. He also slew forty-five of the principal men of Antigonus's\nparty, and set guards at the gates of the city, that nothing might be carried\nout together with their dead bodies. They also searched the dead, and whatsoever\nwas found, either of silver or gold, or other treasure, it was carried\nto the king; nor was there any end of the miseries he brought upon them;\nand this distress was in part occasioned by the covetousness of the prince\nregent, who was still in want of more, and in part by the Sabbatic year,\nwhich was still going on, and forced the country to lie still uncultivated,\nsince we are forbidden to sow our land in that year. Now when Antony had\nreceived Antigonus as his captive, he determined to keep him against his\ntriumph; but when he heard that the nation grew seditious, and that, out\nof their hatred to Herod, they continued to bear good-will to Antigonus,\nhe resolved to behead him at Antioch, for otherwise the Jews could no way\nbe brought to be quiet. And Strabo of Cappadocia attests to what I have\nsaid, when he thus speaks: \"Antony ordered Antigonus the Jew to be\nbrought to Antioch, and there to be beheaded. And this Antony seems to\nme to have been the very first man who beheaded a king, as supposing he\ncould no other way bend the minds of the Jews so as to receive Herod, whom\nhe had made king in his stead; for by no torments could they he forced\nto call him king, so great a fondness they had for their former king; so\nhe thought that this dishonorable death would diminish the value they had\nfor Antigonus's memory, and at the same time would diminish the hatred\nthey bare to Herod.\" Thus far Strabo.", "NOW after Herod was in possession of the kingdom, Hyrcanus the high\npriest, who was then a captive among the Parthians, came to him again,\nand was set free from his captivity, in the manner following: Barzapharnes\nand Pacorus, the generals of the Parthians, took Hyreanus, who was first\nmade high priest and afterward king, and Herod's brother, Phasaelus captives,\nand were them away into Parthis. Phasaelus indeed could not bear the reproach\nof being in bonds; and thinking that death with glory was better than any\nlife whatsoever, he became his own executioner, as I have formerly related.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The city here called \"Babylon\" by Josephus, seems to be one which\nwas built by some of the Seleucidae upon the Tigris, which long after the\nutter desolation of old Babylon was commonly so called, and I suppose not\nfar from Seleueia; just as the latter adjoining city Bagdat has been and\nis often called by the same old name of Babylon till this very day."}, "#text": "But when Hyrcanus was brought into Parthia the king Phraates treated\nhim after a very gentle manner, as having already learned of what an illustrious\nfamily he was; on which account he set him free from his bonds, and gave\nhim a habitation at Babylon, \nwhere there were Jews in great numbers. These Jews honored Hyrcanus as\ntheir high priest and king, as did all the Jewish nation that dwelt as\nfar as Euphrates; which respect was very much to his satisfaction. But\nwhen he was informed that Herod had received the kingdom, new hopes came\nupon him, as having been himself still of a kind disposition towards him,\nand expecting that Herod would bear in mind what favor be had received\nfrom him; and when he was upon his trial, and when he was in danger that\na capital sentence would be pronounced against him, he delivered him from\nthat danger, and from all punishment. Accordingly, he talked of that matter\nwith the Jew that came often to him with great affection; but they endeavored\nto retain him among them, and desired that he would stay with them, putting\nhim in mind of the kind offices and honors they did him, and that those\nhonors they paid him were not at all inferior to what they could pay to\neither their high priests or their kings; and what was a greater motive\nto determine him, they said, was this, that he could not have those dignities\n[in Judea] because of that maim in his body, which had been inflicted on\nhim by Antigonus; and that kings do not use to requite men for those kindnesses\nwhich they received when they were private persons, the height of their\nfortune making usually no small changes in them."}, "Now although they suggested these arguments to him for his own advantage,\nyet did Hyrcanus still desire to depart. Herod also wrote to him, and persuaded\nhim to desire of Phraates, and the Jews that were there, that they should\nnot grudge him the royal authority, which he should have jointly with himself,\nfor that now was the proper time for himself to make him amends for the\nfavors he had received from him, as having been brought up by him, and\nsaved by him also, as well as for Hyrcanus to receive it. And as he wrote\nthus to Hyrcanus, so did he send also Saramallas, his ambassador, to Phraates,\nand many presents with him, and desired him in the most obliging way that\nhe would be no hinderance to his gratitude towards his benefactor. But\nthis zeal of Herod's did not flow from that principle, but because he had\nbeen made governor of that country without having any just claim to it,\nhe was afraid, and that upon reasons good enough, of a change in his condition,\nand so made what haste he could to get Hyrcanus into his power, or indeed\nto put him quite out of the way; which last thing he compassed afterward.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Here we have an eminent example of Herod's worldly and profane politics,\nwhen by the abuse of his unlawful and usurped power, to make whom he pleased\nhigh priest, in the person of Ananelus, he occasioned such disturbances\nin his kingdom, and in his own family, as suffered him to enjoy no lasting\npeace or tranquillity ever afterward; and such is frequently the effect\nof profane court politics about matters of religion in other ages and nations.\nThe Old Testament is full of the miseries of the people of the Jews derived\nfrom such court politics, especially in and after the days of Jeroboam\nthe son of Nebat, \"who made Israel to sin;\" who gave the most\npernicious example of it; who brought on the grossest corruption of religion\nby it; and the punishment of whose family for it was most remarkable.

He called him his father, and endeavored, by\nall the ways possible, that he might have no suspicion of any treacherous\ndesign against him. He also did other things, in order to secure his government,\nwhich yet occasioned a sedition in his own family; for being cautious how\nhe made any illustrious person the high priest of God, \nhe sent for an obscure priest out of Babylon, whose name was Ananelus,\nand bestowed the high priesthood upon him."}, "However, Alexandra, the daughter of Hyrcanus, and wife of Alexander,\nthe son of Aristobulus the king, who had also brought Alexander [two] children,\ncould not bear this indignity. Now this son was one of the greatest comeliness,\nand was called Aristobulus; and the daughter, Mariamne, was married to\nHerod, and eminent for her beauty also. This Alexandra was much disturbed,\nand took this indignity offered to her son exceeding ill, that while be\nwas alive, any one else should be sent for to have the dignity of the high\npriesthood conferred upon him. Accordingly, she wrote to Cleopatra (a musician\nassisting her in taking care to have her letters carried) to desire her\nintercession with Antony, in order to gain the high priesthood for her\nson.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Of this wicked Dellius, see the note on the War, B.

And when she came to discourse\nwith him, he persuaded her to get pictures drawn of them both, and to send\nthem to Antony, for that when he saw them, he would deny her nothing that\nshe should ask. Accordingly, Alexandra was elevated with these words of\nhis, and sent the pictures to Antony. Dellius also talked extravagantly,\nand said that these children seemed not derived from men, but from some\ngod or other. His design in doing so was to entice Antony into lewd pleasures\nwith them, who was ashamed to send for the damsel, as being the wife of\nHerod, and avoided it, because of the reproaches he should have from Cleopatra\non that account; but he sent, in the most decent manner he could, for the\nyoung man; but added this withal, unless he thought it hard upon him so\nto do. When this letter was brought to Herod, he did not think it safe\nfor him to send one so handsome as was Aristobulus, in the prime of his\nlife, for he was sixteen years of age, and of so noble a family, and particularly\nnot to Antony, the principal man among the Romans, and one that would abuse\nhim in his amours, and besides, one that openly indulged himself in such\npleasures as his power allowed him without control. He therefore wrote\nback to him, that if this boy should only go out of the country, all would\nbe in a state of war and uproar, because the Jews were in hopes of a change\nin the government, and to have another king over them."}, "When Herod had thus excused himself to Antony, he resolved that he\nwould not entirely permit the child or Alexandra to be treated dishonorably;\nbut his wife Mariamne lay vehemently at him to restore the high priesthood\nto her brother; and he judged it was for his advantage so to do, because\nif he once had that dignity, he could not go out of the country. So he\ncalled his friends together, and told them that Alexandra privately conspired\nagainst his royal authority, and endeavored, by the means of Cleopatra,\nso to bring it about, that he might be deprived of the government, and\nthat by Antony's means this youth might have the management of public affairs\nin his stead; and that this procedure of hers was unjust, since she would\nat the same time deprive her daughter of the dignity she now had, and would\nbring disturbances upon the kingdom, for which he had taken a great deal\nof pains, and had gotten it with extraordinary hazards; that yet, while\nhe well remembered her wicked practices, he would not leave off doing what\nwas right himself, but would even now give the youth the high priesthood;\nand that he formerly set up Ananelus, because Aristobulus was then so very\nyoung a child. Now when he had said this, not at random, but as he thought\nwith the best discretion he had, in order to deceive the women, and those\nfriends whom he had taken to consult withal, Alexandra, out of the great\njoy she had at this unexpected promise, and out of fear from the suspicions\nshe lay under, fell a weeping; and made the following apology for herself;\nand said, that as to the [high] priesthood, she was very much concerned\nfor the disgrace her son was under, and so did her utmost endeavors to\nprocure it for him; but that as to the kingdom, she had made no attempts,\nand that if it were offered her [for her son], she would not accept it;\nand that now she would be satisfied with her son's dignity, while he himself\nheld the civil government, and she had thereby the security that arose\nfrom his peculiar ability in governing to all the remainder of her family;\nthat she was now overcome by his benefits, and thankfully accepted of this\nhonor showed by him to her son, and that she would hereafter be entirely\nobedient. And she desired him to excuse her, if the nobility of her family,\nand that freedom of acting which she thought that allowed her, had made\nher act too precipitately and imprudently in this matter.

He was one of the stock of the high\npriests \nand had been of old a particular friend of Herod; and when he was first\nmade king, he conferred that dignity upon him, and now put him out of it\nagain, in order to quiet the troubles in his family, though what he did\nwas plainly unlawful, for at no other time [of old] was any one that had\nonce been in that dignity deprived of it. It was Antiochus Epiphanes who\nfirst brake that law, and deprived Jesus, and made his brother Onias high\npriest in his stead. Aristobulus was the second that did so, and took that\ndignity from his brother [Hyrcanus]; and this Herod was the third, who\ntook that high office away [from Arianflus], and gave it to this young\nman, Aristobulus, in his stead."}, "And now Herod seemed to have healed the divisions in his family;\nyet was he not without suspicion, as is frequently the case, of people\nseeming to be reconciled to one another, but thought that, as Alexandra\nhad already made attempts tending to innovations, so did he fear that she\nwould go on therein, if she found a fit opportunity for so doing; so he\ngave a command that she should dwell in the palace, and meddle with no\npublic affairs. Her guards also were so careful, that nothing she did in\nprivate life every day was concealed. All these hardships put her out of\npatience, by little and little and she began to hate Herod; for as she\nhad the pride of a woman to the utmost degree, she had great indignation\nat this suspicious guard that was about her, as desirous rather to undergo\nany thing that could befall her, than to be deprived of her liberty of\nspeech, and, under the notion of an honorary guard, to live in a state\nof slavery and terror. She therefore sent to Cleopatra, and made a long\ncomplaint of the circumstances she was in, and entreated her to do her\nutmost for her assistance. Cleopatra hereupon advised her to take her son\nwith her, and come away immediately to her into Egypt. This advice pleased\nher; and she had this contrivance for getting away: She got two coffins\nmade, as if they were to carry away two dead bodies and put herself into\none, and her son into the other and gave orders to such of her servants\nas knew of her intentions to carry them away in the night time. Now their\nroad was to be thence to the sea-side and there was a ship ready to carry\nthem into Egypt. Now Aesop, one of her servants, happened to fall upon\nSabion, one of her friends, and spake of this matter to him, as thinking\nhe had known of it before. When Sabion knew this, (who had formerly been\nan enemy of Herod, and been esteemed one of those that laid snares for\nand gave the poison to [his father] Antipater,) he expected that this discovery\nwould change Herod's hatred into kindness; so he told the king of this\nprivate stratagem of Alexandra: whereupon be suffered her to proceed to\nthe execution of her project, and caught her in the very fact; but still\nhe passed by her offense; and though he had a great mind to do it, he durst\nnot inflict any thing that was severe upon her, for he knew that Cleopatra\nwould not bear that he should have her accused, on account of her hatred\nto him; but made a show as if it were rather the generosity of his soul,\nand his great moderation, that made him forgive them. However, he fully\nproposed to himself to put this young man out of the way, by one means\nor other; but he thought he might in probability be better concealed in\ndoing it, if he did it not presently, nor immediately after what had lately\nhappened.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This entirely confutes the Talmudists, who pretend that no one under twenty\nyears of age could officiate as high priest among the Jews."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "A Hebrew chronicle, cited by Reland, says this drowning was at Jordan,\nnot at Jericho, and this even when he quote Josephus.

They\nat once rejoiced and were confounded, and mingled with good wishes their\njoyful acclamations which they made to him, till the good-will of the multitude\nwas made too evident; and they more rashly proclaimed the happiness they\nhad received from his family than was fit under a monarchy to have done.\nUpon all this, Herod resolved to complete what he had intended against\nthe young man. When therefore the festival was over, and he was feasting\nat Jericho \nwith Alexandra, who entertained them there, he was then very pleasant with\nthe young man, and drew him into a lonely place, and at the same time played\nwith him in a juvenile and ludicrous manner. Now the nature of that place\nwas hotter than ordinary; so they went out in a body, and of a sudden,\nand in a vein of madness; and as they stood by the fish-ponds, of which\nthere were large ones about the house, they went to cool themselves [by\nbathing], because it was in the midst of a hot day. At first they were\nonly spectators of Herod's servants and acquaintance as they were swimming;\nbut after a while, the young man, at the instigation of Herod, went into\nthe water among them, while such of Herod's acquaintance, as he had appointed\nto do it, dipped him as he was swimming, and plunged him under water, in\nthe dark of the evening, as if it had been done in sport only; nor did\nthey desist till he was entirely suffocated. And thus was Aristobulus murdered,\nhaving lived no more in all than eighteen years, \nand kept the high priesthood one year only; which high priesthood Ananelus\nnow recovered again."}, "When this sad accident was told the women, their joy was soon changed\nto lamentation, at the sight of the dead body that lay before them, and\ntheir sorrow was immoderate. The city also [of Jerusalem], upon the spreading\nof this news, were in very great grief, every family looking on this calamity\nas if it had not belonged to another, but that one of themselves was slain.\nBut Alexandra was more deeply affected, upon her knowledge that he had\nbeen destroyed [on purpose]. Her sorrow was greater than that of others,\nby her knowing how the murder was committed; but she was under the necessity\nof bearing up under it, out of her prospect of a greater mischief that\nmight otherwise follow; and she oftentimes came to an inclination to kill\nherself with her own hand, but still she restrained herself, in hopes she\nmight live long enough to revenge the unjust murder thus privately committed;\nnay, she further resolved to endeavor to live longer, and to give no occasion\nto think she suspected that her son was slain on purpose, and supposed\nthat she might thereby be in a capacity of revenging it at a proper opportunity.\nThus did she restrain herself, that she might not be noted for entertaining\nany such suspicion. However, Herod endeavored that none abroad should believe\nthat the child's death was caused by any design of his; and for this purpose\nhe did not only use the ordinary signs of sorrow, but fell into tears also,\nand exhibited a real confusion of soul; and perhaps his affections were\novercome on this occasion, when he saw the child's countenance so young\nand so beautiful, although his death was supposed to tend to his own security.\nSo far at least this grief served as to make some apology for him; and\nas for his funeral, that he took care should be very magnificent, by making\ngreat preparation for a sepulcher to lay his body in, and providing a great\nquantity of spices, and burying many ornaments together with him, till\nthe very women, who were in such deep sorrow, were astonished at it, and\nreceived in this way some consolation.", "However, no such things could overcome Alexandra's grief; but the\nremembrance of this miserable case made her sorrow, both deep and obstinate.\nAccordingly, she wrote an account of this treacherous scene to Cleopatra,\nand how her son was murdered; but Cleopatra, as she had formerly been desirous\nto give her what satisfaction she could, and commiserating Alexandra's\nmisfortunes, made the case her own, and would not let Antony be quiet,\nbut excited him to punish the child's murder; for that it was an unworthy\nthing that Herod, who had been by him made king of a kingdom that no way\nbelonged to him, should be guilty of such horrid crimes against those that\nwere of the royal blood in reality. Antony was persuaded by these arguments;\nand when he came to Laodicea, he sent and commanded Herod to come and make\nhis defense, as to what he had done to Aristobulus, for that such a treacherous\ndesign was not well done, if he had any hand in it. Herod was now in fear,\nboth of the accusation, and of Cleopatra's ill-will to him, which was such\nthat she was ever endeavoring to make Antony hate him. He therefore determined\nto obey his summons, for he had no possible way to avoid it. So he left\nhis uncle Joseph procurator for his government, and for the public affairs,\nand gave him a private charge, that if Antony should kill him, he also\nshould kill Mariamne immediately; for that he had a tender affection for\nthis his wife, and was afraid of the injury that should be offered him,\nif, after his death, she, for her beauty, should be engaged to some other\nman: but his intimation was nothing but this at the bottom, that Antony\nhad fallen in love with her, when he had formerly heard somewhat of her\nbeauty. So when Herod had given Joseph this charge, and had indeed no sure\nhopes of escaping with his life, he went away to Antony.", "But as Joseph was administering the public affairs of the kingdom,\nand for that reason was very frequently with Mariamne, both because his\nbusiness required it, and because of the respects he ought to pay to the\nqueen, he frequently let himself into discourses about Herod's kindness,\nand great affection towards her; and when the women, especially Alexandra,\nused to turn his discourses into feminine raillery, Joseph was so over-desirous\nto demonstrate the kings inclinations, that he proceeded so far as to mention\nthe charge he had received, and thence drew his demonstration, that Herod\nwas not able to live without her; and that if he should come to any ill\nend, he could not endure a separation from her, even after he was dead.\nThus spake Joseph. But the women, as was natural, did not take this to\nbe an instance of Herod's strong affection for them, but of his severe\nusage of them, that they could not escape destruction, nor a tyrannical\ndeath, even when he was dead himself. And this saying [of Joseph] was a\nfoundation for the women's severe suspicions about him afterwards.", "At this time a report went about the city Jerusalem among Herod's\nenemies, that Antony had tortured Herod, and put him to death. This report,\nas is natural, disturbed those that were about the palace, but chiefly\nthe women; upon which Alexandra endeavored to persuade Joseph to go out\nof the palace, and fly away with them to the ensigns of the Roman legion,\nwhich then lay encamped about the city, as a guard to the kingdom, under\nthe command of Julius; for that by this means, if any disturbance should\nhappen about the palace, they should be in greater security, as having\nthe Romans favorable to them; and that besides, they hoped to obtain the\nhighest authority, if Antony did but once see Mariamne, by whose means\nthey should recover the kingdom, and want nothing which was reasonable\nfor them to hope for, because of their royal extraction.", "But as they were in the midst of these deliberations, letters were\nbrought from Herod about all his affairs, and proved contrary to the report,\nand of what they before expected; for when he was come to Antony, he soon\nrecovered his interest with him, by the presents he made him, which he\nhad brought with him from Jerusalem; and he soon induced him, upon discoursing\nwith him, to leave off his indignation at him, so that Cleopatra's persuasions\nhad less force than the arguments and presents he brought to regain his\nfriendship; for Antony said that it was not good to require an account\nof a king, as to the affairs of his government, for at this rate he could\nbe no king at all, but that those who had given him that authority ought\nto permit him to make use of it. He also said the same things to Cleopatra,\nthat it would be best for her not busily to meddle with the acts of the\nking's government. Herod wrote an account of these things, and enlarged\nupon the other honors which he had received from Antony; how he sat by\nhim at his hearing causes, and took his diet with him every day, and that\nhe enjoyed those favors from him, notwithstanding the reproaches that Cleopatra\nso severely laid against him, who having a great desire of his country,\nand earnestly entreating Antony that the kingdom might be given to her,\nlabored with her utmost diligence to have him out of the way; but that\nhe still found Antony just to him, and had no longer any apprehensions\nof hard treatment from him; and that he was soon upon his return, with\na firmer additional assurance of his favor to him, in his reigning and\nmanaging public affairs; and that there was no longer any hope for Cleopatra's\ncovetous temper, since Antony had given her Celesyria instead of what she\nhad desired; by which means he had at once pacified her, and got clear\nof the entreaties which she made him to have Judea bestowed upon her.", "When these letters were brought, the women left off their attempt\nfor flying to the Romans, which they thought of while Herod was supposed\nto be dead; yet was not that purpose of theirs a secret; but when the king\nhad conducted Antony on his way against the Partnians, he returned to Judea,\nwhen both his sister Salome and his mother informed him of Alexandra's\nintentions. Salome also added somewhat further against Joseph, though it\nwas no more than a calumny, that he had often had criminal conversation\nwith Mariamne. The reason of her saying so was this, that she for a long\ntime bare her ill-will; for when they had differences with one another,\nMariamne took great freedoms, and reproached the rest for the meanness\nof their birth. But Herod, whose affection to Mariamne was always very\nwarm, was presently disturbed at this, and could not bear the torments\nof jealousy, but was still restrained from doing any rash thing to her\nby the love he had for her; yet did his vehement affection and jealousy\ntogether make him ask Mariamne by herself about this matter of Joseph;\nbut she denied it upon her oath, and said all that an innocent woman could\npossibly say in her own defense; so that by little and little the king\nwas prevailed upon to drop the suspicion, and left off his anger at her;\nand being overcome with his passion for his wife, he made an apology to\nher for having seemed to believe what he had heard about her, and returned\nher a great many acknowledgments of her modest behavior, and professed\nthe extraordinary affection and kindness he had for her, till at last,\nas is usual between lovers, they both fell into tears, and embraced one\nanother with a most tender affection. But as the king gave more and more\nassurances of his belief of her fidelity, and endeavored to draw her to\na like confidence in him, Marianme said, Yet was not that command thou\ngavest, that if any harm came to thee from Antony, I, who had been no occasion\nof it, should perish with thee, a sign of thy love to me?\" When these\nwords were fallen from her, the king was shocked at them, and presently\nlet her go out of his arms, and cried out, and tore his hair with his own\nhands, and said, that \"now he had an evident demonstration that Joseph\nhad had criminal conversation with his wife; for that he would never have\nuttered what he had told him alone by himself, unless there had been such\na great familiarity and firm confidence between them. And while he was\nin this passion he had like to have killed his wife; but being still overborne\nby his love to her, he restrained this his passion, though not without\na lasting grief and disquietness of mind. However, he gave order to slay\nJoseph, without permitting him to come into his sight; and as for Alexandra,\nhe bound her, and kept her in custody, as the cause of all this mischief.", "NOW at this time the affairs of Syria were in confusion by Cleopatra's\nconstant persuasions to Antony to make an attempt upon every body's dominions;\nfor she persuaded him to take those dominions away from their several princes,\nand bestow them upon her; and she had a mighty influence upon him, by reason\nof his being enslaved to her by his affections. She was also by nature\nvery covetous, and stuck at no wickedness. She had already poisoned her\nbrother, because she knew that he was to be king of Egypt, and this when\nhe was but fifteen years old; and she got her sister Arsinoe to be slain,\nby the means of Antony, when she was a supplicant at Diana's temple at\nEphesus; for if there were but any hopes of getting money, she would violate\nboth temples and sepulchers. Nor was there any holy place that was esteemed\nthe most inviolable, from which she would not fetch the ornaments it had\nin it; nor any place so profane, but was to suffer the most flagitious\ntreatment possible from her, if it could but contribute somewhat to the\ncovetous humor of this wicked creature: yet did not all this suffice so\nextravagant a woman, who was a slave to her lusts, but she still imagined\nthat she wanted every thing she could think of, and did her utmost to gain\nit; for which reason she hurried Antony on perpetually to deprive others\nof their dominions, and give them to her. And as she went over Syria with\nhim, she contrived to get it into her possession; so he slew Lysanias,\nthe son of Ptolemy, accusing him of his bringing the Parthians upon those\ncountries. She also petitioned Antony to give her Judea and Arabia; and,\nin order thereto, desired him to take these countries away from their present\ngovernors. As for Antony, he was so entirely overcome by this woman, that\none would not think her conversation only could do it, but that he was\nsome way or other bewitched to do whatsoever she would have him; yet did\nthe grossest parts of her injustice make him so ashamed, that he would\nnot always hearken to her to do those flagrant enormities she would have\npersuaded him to. That therefore he might not totally deny her, nor, by\ndoing every thing which she enjoined him, appear openly to be an ill man,\nhe took some parts of each of those countries away from their former governors,\nand gave them to her. Thus he gave her the cities that were within the\nriver Eleutherus, as far as Egypt, excepting Tyre and Sidon, which he knew\nto have been free cities from their ancestors, although she pressed him\nvery often to bestow those on her also.", "When Cleopatra had obtained thus much, and had accompanied Antony\nin his expedition to Armenia as far as Euphrates, she returned back, and\ncame to Apamia and Damascus, and passed on to Judea, where Herod met her,\nand farmed of her parts of Arabia, and those revenues that came to her\nfrom the region about Jericho. This country bears that balsam, which is\nthe most precious drug that is there, and grows there alone. The place\nbears also palm trees, both many in number, and those excellent in their\nkind. When she was there, and was very often with Herod, she endeavored\nto have criminal conversation with the king; nor did she affect secrecy\nin the indulgence of such sort of pleasures; and perhaps she had in some\nmeasure a passion of love to him; or rather, what is most probable, she\nlaid a treacherous snare for him, by aiming to obtain such adulterous conversation\nfrom him: however, upon the whole, she seemed overcome with love to him.\nNow Herod had a great while borne no good-will to Cleopatra, as knowing\nthat she was a woman irksome to all; and at that time he thought her particularly\nworthy of his hatred, if this attempt proceeded out of lust; he had also\nthought of preventing her intrigues, by putting her to death, if such were\nher endeavors. However, he refused to comply with her proposals, and called\na counsel of his friends to consult with them whether he should not kill\nher, now he had her in his power; for that he should thereby deliver all\nthose from a multitude of evils to whom she was already become irksome,\nand was expected to be still so for the time to come; and that this very\nthing would be much for the advantage of Antony himself, since she would\ncertainly not be faithful to him, in case any such season or necessity\nshould come upon him as that he should stand in need of her fidelity. But\nwhen he thought to follow this advice, his friends would not let him; and\ntold him that, in the first place, it was not right to attempt so great\na thing, and run himself thereby into the utmost danger; and they laid\nhard at him, and begged of him to undertake nothing rashly, for that Antony\nwould never bear it, no, not though any one should evidently lay before\nhis eyes that it was for his own advantage; and that the appearance of\ndepriving him of her conversation, by this violent and treacherous method,\nwould probably set his affections more on a flame than before. Nor did\nit appear that he could offer any thing of tolerable weight in his defense,\nthis attempt being against such a woman as was of the highest dignity of\nany of her sex at that time in the world; and as to any advantage to be\nexpected from such an undertaking, if any such could be supposed in this\ncase, it would appear to deserve condemnation, on account of the insolence\nhe must take upon him in doing it: which considerations made it very plain\nthat in so doing he would find his government filled with mischief, both\ngreat and lasting, both to himself and his posterity, whereas it was still\nin his power to reject that wickedness she would persuade him to, and to\ncome off honorably at the same time. So by thus affrighting Herod, and\nrepresenting to him the hazard he must, in all probability, run by this\nundertaking, they restrained him from it. So he treated Cleopatra kindly,\nand made her presents, and conducted her on her way to Egypt.", "But Antony subdued Armenia, and sent Artabazes, the son of Tigranes,\nin bonds, with his children and procurators, to Egypt, and made a present\nof them, and of all the royal ornaments which he had taken out of that\nkingdom, to Cleopatra. And Artaxias, the eldest of his sons, who had escaped\nat that time, took the kingdom of Armenia; who yet was ejected by Archclaus\nand Nero Caesar, when they restored Tigranes, his younger brother, to that\nkingdom; but this happened a good while afterward.", "But then, as to the tributes which Herod was to pay Cleopatra for\nthat country which Antony had given her, he acted fairly with her, as deeming\nit not safe for him to afford any cause for Cleopatra to hate him. As for\nthe king of Arabia, whose tribute Herod had undertaken to pay her, for\nsome time indeed he paid him as much as came to two hundred talents; but\nhe afterwards became very niggardly and slow in his payments, and could\nhardly be brought to pay some parts of it, and was not willing to pay even\nthem without some deductions.", "HEREUPON Herod held himself ready to go against the king of Arabia,\nbecause of his ingratitude to him, and because, after all, he would do\nnothing that was just to him, although Herod made the Roman war an occasion\nof delaying his own; for the battle at Actium was now expected, which fell\ninto the hundred eighty and seventh olympiad, where Caesar and Antony were\nto fight for the supreme power of the world; but Herod having enjoyed a\ncountry that was very fruitful, and that now for a long time, and having\nreceived great taxes, and raised great armies therewith, got together a\nbody of men, and carefully furnished them with all necessaries, and designed\nthem as auxiliaries for Antony. But Antony said he had no want of his assistance;\nbut he commanded him to punish the king of Arabia; for he had heard both\nfrom him, and from Cleopatra, how perfidious he was; for this was what\nCleopatra desired, who thought it for her own advantage that these two\nkings should do one another as great mischief as possible. Upon this message\nfrom Antony, Herod returned back, but kept his army with him, in order\nto invade Arabia immediately. So when his army of horsemen and footmen\nwas ready, he marched to Diospolis, whither the Arabians came also to meet\nthem, for they were not unapprized of this war that was coming upon them;\nand after a great battle had been fought, the Jews had the victory. But\nafterward there were gotten together another numerous army of the Arabians,\nat Cana, which is a place of Celesyria. Herod was informed of this beforehand;\nso he came marching against them with the greatest part of the forces he\nhad; and when he was come near to Cana, he resolved to encamp himself;\nand he cast up a bulwark, that he might take a proper season for attacking\nthe enemy; but as he was giving those orders, the multitude of the Jews\ncried out that he should make no delay, but lead them against the Arabians.\nThey went with great spirit, as believing they were in very good order;\nand those especially were so that had been in the former battle, and had\nbeen conquerors, and had not permitted their enemies so much as to come\nto a close fight with them. And when they were so tumultuous, and showed\nsuch great alacrity, the king resolved to make use of that zeal the multitude\nthen exhibited; and when he had assured them he would not be behindhand\nwith them in courage, he led them on, and stood before them all in his\narmor, all the regiments following him in their several ranks: whereupon\na consternation fell upon the Arabians; for when they perceived that the\nJews were not to be conquered, and were full of spirit, the greater part\nof them ran away, and avoided fighting; and they had been quite destroyed,\nhad not Anthony fallen upon the Jews, and distressed them; for this man\nwas Cleopatra's general over the soldiers she had there, and was at enmity\nwith Herod, and very wistfully looked on to see what the event of the battle\nwould be. He had also resolved, that in case the Arabians did any thing\nthat was brave and successful, he would lie still; but in case they were\nbeaten, as it really happened, he would attack the Jews with those forces\nhe had of his own, and with those that the country had gotten together\nfor him. So he fell upon the Jews unexpectedly, when they were fatigued,\nand thought they had already vanquished the enemy, and made a great slaughter\nof them; for as the Jews had spent their courage upon their known enemies,\nand were about to enjoy themselves in quietness after their victory, they\nwere easily beaten by these that attacked them afresh, and in particular\nreceived a great loss in places where the horses could not be of service,\nand which were very stony, and where those that attacked them were better\nacquainted with the places than themselves. And when the Jews had suffered\nthis loss, the Arabians raised their spirits after their defeat, and returning\nback again, slew those that were already put to flight; and indeed all\nsorts of slaughter were now frequent, and of those that escaped, a few\nonly returned into the camp. So king Herod, when he despaired of the battle,\nrode up to them to bring them assistance; yet did he not come time enough\nto do them any service, though he labored hard to do it; but the Jewish\ncamp was taken; so that the Arabians had unexpectedly a most glorious success,\nhaving gained that victory which of themselves they were no way likely\nto have gained, and slaying a great part of the enemy's army: whence afterward\nHerod could only act like a private robber, and make excursions upon many\nparts of Arabia, and distress them by sudden incursions, while he encamped\namong the mountains, and avoided by any means to come to a pitched battle;\nyet did he greatly harass the enemy by his assiduity, and the hard labor\nhe took in this matter. He also took great care of his own forces, and\nused all the means he could to restore his affairs to their old state.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The reader is here to take notice, that this seventh year of the reign\nof Herod, and all the other years of his reign, in Josephus, are dated\nfrom the death of Antigonus, or at the soonest from the conclusion of Antigonus,\nand the taking of Jerusalem a few months before, and never from his first\nobtaining the kingdom at Rome, above three years before, as some have very\nweakly and injudiciously done."}, "#text": "At this time it was that the fight happened at Actium, between Octavius\nCaesar and Antony, in the seventh year of the reign of Herod \nand then it was also that there was an earthquake in Judea, such a one\nas had not happened at any other time, and which earthquake brought a great\ndestruction upon the cattle in that country. About ten thousand men also\nperished by the fall of houses; but the army, which lodged in the field,\nreceived no damage by this sad accident. When the Arabians were informed\nof this, and when those that hated the Jews, and pleased themselves with\naggravating the reports, told them of it, they raised their spirits, as\nif their enemy's country was quite overthrown, and the men were utterly\ndestroyed, and thought there now remained nothing that could oppose them.\nAccordingly, they took the Jewish ambassadors, who came to them after all\nthis had happened, to make peace with them, and slew them, and came with\ngreat alacrity against their army; but the Jews durst not withstand them,\nand were so cast down by the calamities they were under, that they took\nno care of their affairs, but gave up themselves to despair; for they had\nno hope that they should be upon a level again with them in battles, nor\nobtain any assistance elsewhere, while their affairs at home were in such\ngreat distress also. When matters were in this condition, the king persuaded\nthe commanders by his words, and tried to raise their spirits, which were\nquite sunk; and first he endeavored to encourage and embolden some of the\nbetter sort beforehand, and then ventured to make a speech to the multitude,\nwhich he had before avoided to do, lest he should find them uneasy thereat,\nbecause of the misfortunes which had happened; so he made a consolatory\nspeech to the multitude, in the manner following:"}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Herod says here, that as ambassadors were sacred when they carried messages\nto others, so did the laws of the Jews derive a sacred authority by being\ndelivered from God by angels, [or Divine ambassadors,] which is St. Paul's\nexpression about the same laws, Galatians 3:19; Hebrews 2;2."}, "#text": "\"You are not unacquainted, my fellow soldiers, that we have\nhad, not long since, many accidents that have put a stop to what we are\nabout, and it is probable that even those that are most distinguished above\nothers for their courage can hardly keep up their spirits in such circumstances;\nbut since we cannot avoid fighting, and nothing that hath happened is of\nsuch a nature but it may by ourselves be recovered into a good state, and\nthis by one brave action only well performed, I have proposed to myself\nboth to give you some encouragement, and, at the same time, some information;\nboth which parts of my design will tend to this point; that you may still\ncontinue in your own proper fortitude.

I shall begin with the\nfirst, and appeal to yourselves as witnesses to what I shall say. You are\nnot ignorant certainly of the wickedness of the Arabians, which is to that\ndegree as to appear incredible to all other men, and to include somewhat\nthat shows the grossest barbarity and ignorance of God. The chief things\nwherein they have affronted us have arisen from covetousness and envy;\nand they have attacked us in an insidious manner, and on the sudden. And\nwhat occasion is there for me to mention many instances of such their procedure?\nWhen they were in danger of losing their own government of themselves,\nand of being slaves to Cleopatra, what others were they that freed them\nfrom that fear? for it was the friendship. I had with Antony, and the kind\ndisposition he was in towards us, that hath been the occasion that even\nthese Arabians have not been utterly undone, Antony being unwilling to\nundertake any thing which might be suspected by us of unkindness: but when\nhe had a mind to bestow some parts of each of our dominions on Cleopatra,\nI also managed that matter so, that by giving him presents of my own, I\nmight obtain a security to both nations, while I undertook myself to answer\nfor the money, and gave him two hundred talents, and became surety for\nthose two hundred more which were imposed upon the land that was subject\nto this tribute; and this they have defrauded us of, although it was not\nreasonable that Jews should pay tribute to any man living, or allow part\nof their land to be taxable; but although that was to be, yet ought we\nnot to pay tribute for these Arabians, whom we have ourselves preserved;\nnor is it fit that they, who have professed (and that with great integrity\nand sense of our kindness) that it is by our means that they keep their\nprincipality, should injure us, and deprive us of what is our due, and\nthis while we have been still not their enemies, but their friends. And\nwhereas observation of covenants takes place among the bitterest enemies,\nbut among friends is absolutely necessary, this is not observed among these\nmen, who think gain to be the best of all things, let it be by any means\nwhatsoever, and that injustice is no harm, if they may but get money by\nit: is it therefore a question with you, whether the unjust are to be punished\nor not? when God himself hath declared his mind that so it ought to be,\nand hath commanded that we ever should hate injuries and injustice, which\nis not only just, but necessary, in wars between several nations; for these\nArabians have done what both the Greeks and barbarians own to be an instance\nof the grossest wickedness, with regard to our ambassadors, which they\nhave beheaded, while the Greeks declare that such ambassadors are sacred\nand inviolable. \nAnd for ourselves, we have learned from God the most excellent of our doctrines,\nand the most holy part of our law, by angels or ambassadors; for this name\nbrings God to the knowledge of mankind, and is sufficient to reconcile\nenemies one to another. What wickedness then can be greater than the slaughter\nof ambassadors, who come to treat about doing what is right? And when such\nhave been their actions, how is it possible they can either live securely\nin common life, or be successful in war? In my opinion, this is impossible;\nbut perhaps some will say, that what is holy, and what is righteous, is\nindeed on our side, but that the Arabians are either more courageous or\nmore numerous than we are. Now, as to this, in the first place, it is not\nfit for us to say so, for with whom is what is righteous, with them is\nGod himself; now where God is, there is both multitude and courage. But\nto examine our own circumstances a little, we were conquerors in the first\nbattle; and when we fought again, they were not able to oppose us, but\nran away, and could not endure our attacks or our courage; but when we\nhad conquered them, then came Athenion, and made war against us without\ndeclaring it; and pray, is this an instance of their manhood? or is it\nnot a second instance of their wickedness and treachery? Why are we therefore\nof less courage, on account of that which ought to inspire us with stronger\nhopes? and why are we terrified at these, who, when they fight upon the\nlevel, are continually beaten, and when they seem to be conquerors, they\ngain it by wickedness? and if we suppose that any one should deem them\nto be men of real courage, will not he be excited by that very consideration\nto do his utmost against them? for true valor is not shown by fighting\nagainst weak persons, but in being able to overcome the most hardy. But\nthen if the distresses we are ourselves under, and the miseries that have\ncome by the earthquake, hath aftrighted any one, let him consider, in the\nfirst place, that this very thing will deceive the Arabians, by their supposal\nthat what hath befallen us is greater than it really is. Moreover, it is\nnot right that the same thing that emboldens them should discourage us;\nfor these men, you see, do not derive their alacrity from any advantageous\nvirtue of their own, but from their hope, as to us, that we are quite cast\ndown by our misfortunes; but when we boldly march against them, we shall\nsoon pull down their insolent conceit of themselves, and shall gain this\nby attacking them, that they will not be so insolent when we come to the\nbattle; for our distresses are not so great, nor is what hath happened\nall indication of the anger of God against us, as some imagine; for such\nthings are accidental, and adversities that come in the usual course of\nthings; and if we allow that this was done by the will of God, we must\nallow that it is now over by his will also, and that he is satisfied with\nwhat hath already happened; for had he been willing to afflict us still\nmore thereby, he had not changed his mind so soon. And as for the war we\nare engaged in, he hath himself demonstrated that he is willing it should\ngo on, and that he knows it to be a just war; for while some of the people\nin the country have perished, all you who were in arms have suffered nothing,\nbut are all preserved alive; whereby God makes it plain to us, that if\nyou had universally, with your children and wives, been in the army, it\nhad come to pass that you had not undergone any thing that would have much\nhurt you. Consider these things, and, what is more than all the rest, that\nyou have God at all times for your Protector; and prosecute these men with\na just bravery, who, in point of friendship, are unjust, in their battles\nperfidious, towards ambassadors impious, and always inferior to you in\nvalor.\""}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This piece of religion, the supplicating God with sacrifices, by Herod,\nbefore he went to this fight with the Arabians, taken notice of also in\nthe first book of the War, ch. 19. sect. 5, is worth remarking, because\nit is the only example of this nature, so far as I remember, that Josephus\never mentions in all his large and particular accounts of this Herod; and\nit was when he had been in mighty distress, and discouraged by a great\ndefeat of his former army, and by a very great earthquake in Judea, such\ntimes of affliction making men most religious; nor was he disappointed\nof his hopes here, but immediately gained a most signal victory over the\nArabians, while they who just before had been so great victors, and so\nmuch elevated upon the earthquake in Judea as to venture to slay the Jewish\nambassadors, were now under a strange consternation, and hardly able to\nfight at all."}, "#text": "When the Jews heard this speech, they were much raised in their minds,\nand more disposed to fight than before. So Herod, when he had offered the\nsacrifices appointed by the law \nmade haste, and took them, and led them against the Arabians; and in order\nto that passed over Jordan, and pitched his camp near to that of the enemy.\nHe also thought fit to seize upon a certain castle that lay in the midst\nof them, as hoping it would be for his advantage, and would the sooner\nproduce a battle; and that if there were occasion for delay, he should\nby it have his camp fortified; and as the Arabians had the same intentions\nupon that place, a contest arose about it; at first they were but skirmishes,\nafter which there came more soldiers, and it proved a sort of fight, and\nsome fell on both sides, till those of the Arabian side were beaten and\nretreated. This was no small encouragement to the Jews immediately; and\nwhen Herod observed that the enemy's army was disposed to any thing rather\nthan to come to an engagement, he ventured boldly to attempt the bulwark\nitself, and to pull it to pieces, and so to get nearer to their camp, in\norder to fight them; for when they were forced out of their trenches, they\nwent out in disorder, and had not the least alacrity, or hope of victory;\nyet did they fight hand to hand, because they were more in number than\nthe Jews, and because they were in such a disposition of war that they\nwere under a necessity of coming on boldly; so they came to a terrible\nbattle, while not a few fell on each side. However, at length the Arabians\nfled; and so great a slaughter was made upon their being routed, that they\nwere not only killed by their enemies, but became the authors of their\nown deaths also, and were trodden down by the multitude, and the great\ncurrent of people in disorder, and were destroyed by their own armor; so\nfive thousand men lay dead upon the spot, while the rest of the multitude\nsoon ran within the bulwark for safety, but had no firm hope of safety,\nby reason of their want of necessaries, and especially of water. The Jews\npursued them, but could not get in with them, but sat round about the bulwark,\nand watched any assistance that would get in to them, and prevented any\nthere, that had a mind to it, from running away."}, "When the Arabians were in these circumstances, they sent ambassadors\nto Herod, in the first place, to propose terms of accommodation, and after\nthat to offer him, so pressing was their thirst upon them, to undergo whatsoever\nhe pleased, if he would free them from their present distress; but he would\nadmit of no ambassadors, of no price of redemption, nor of any other moderate\nterms whatever, being very desirous to revenge those unjust actions which\nthey had been guilty of towards his nation. So they were necessitated by\nother motives, and particularly by their thirst, to come out, and deliver\nthemselves up to him, to be carried away captives; and in five days' time\nthe number of four thousand were taken prisoners, while all the rest resolved\nto make a sally upon their enemies, and to fight it out with them, choosing\nrather, if so it must be, to die therein, than to perish gradually and\ningloriously. When they had taken this resolution, they came out of their\ntrenches, but could no way sustain the fight, being too much disabled,\nboth in mind and body, and having not room to exert themselves, and thought\nit an advantage to be killed, and a misery to survive; so at the first\nonset there fell about seven thousand of them, after which stroke they\nlet all the courage they had put on before fall, and stood amazed at Herod's\nwarlike spirit under his own calamities; so for the future they yielded,\nand made him ruler of their nation; whereupon he was greatly elevated at\nso seasonable a success, and returned home, taking great authority upon\nhim, on account of so bold and glorious an expedition as he had made.", "HEROD'S other affairs were now very prosperous, and he was not to\nbe easily assaulted on any side. Yet did there come upon him a danger that\nwould hazard his entire dominions, after Antony had been beaten at the\nbattle of Actium by Caesar [Octarian]; for at that time both Herod's enemies\nand friends despaired of his affairs, for it was not probable that he would\nremain without punishment, who had showed so much friendship for Antony.\nSo it happened that his friends despaired, and had no hopes of his escape;\nbut for his enemies, they all outwardly appeared to be troubled at his\ncase, but were privately very glad of it, as hoping to obtain a change\nfor the better. As for Herod himself he saw that there was no one of royal\ndignity left but Hyrcanus, and therefore he thought it would be for his\nadvantage not to suffer him to be an obstacle in his way any longer; for\nthat in case he himself survived, and escaped the danger he was in, he\nthought it the safest way to put it out of the power of such a man to make\nany attempt against him, at such junctures of affairs, as was more worthy\nof the kingdom than himself; and in case he should be slain by Caesar,\nhis envy prompted him to desire to slay him that would otherwise be king\nafter him.", "While Herod had these things in his mind, there was a certain occasion\nafforded him: for Hyrcanus was of so mild a temper, both then and at other\ntimes, that he desired not to meddle with public affairs, nor to concern\nhimself with innovations, but left all to fortune, and contented himself\nwith what that afforded him: but Alexandra [his daughter] was a lover of\nstrife, and was exceeding desirous of a change of the government, and spake\nto her father not to bear for ever Herod's injurious treatment of their\nfamily, but to anticipate their future hopes, as he safely might; and desired\nhim to write about these matters to Malchus, who was then governor of Arabia,\nto receive them, and to secure them [from Herod], for that if they went\naway, and Herod's affairs proved to be as it was likely they would be,\nby reason of Caesar's enmity to him, they should then be the only persons\nthat could take the government; and this, both on account of the royal\nfamily they were of, and on account of the good disposition of: the multitude\nto them. While she used these persuasions, Hyrcanus put off her suit; but\nas she showed that she was a woman, and a contentious woman too, and would\nnot desist either night or day, but would always be speaking to him about\nthese matters, and about Herod's treacherous designs, she at last prevailed\nwith him to intrust Dositheus, one of his friends, with a letter, wherein\nhis resolution was declared; and he desired the Arabian governor to send\nto him some horsemen, who should receive him, and conduct him to the lake\nAsphaltites, which is from the bounds of Jerusalem three hundred furlongs:\nand he did therefore trust Dositheus with this letter, because he was a\ncareful attendant on him, and on Alexandra, and had no small occasions\nto bear ill-will to Herod; for he was a kinsman of one Joseph, whom he\nhad slain, and a brother of those that were formerly slain at Tyre by Antony:\nyet could not these motives induce Dositheus to serve Hyrcanus in this\naffair; for, preferring the hopes he had from the present king to those\nhe had from him, he gave Herod the letter. So he took his kindness in good\npart, and bid him besides do what he had already done, that is, go on in\nserving him, by rolling up the epistle and sealing it again, and delivering\nit to Malchus, and then to bring back his letter in answer to it; for it\nwould be much better if he could know Malchus's intentions also. And when\nDositheus was very ready to serve him in this point also, the Arabian governor\nreturned back for answer, that he would receive Hyrcanus, and all that\nshould come with him, and even all the Jews that were of his party; that\nhe would, moreover, send forces sufficient to secure them in their journey;\nand that he should be in no want of any thing he should desire. Now as\nsoon as Herod had received this letter, he immediately sent for Hyrcanus,\nand questioned him about the league he had made with Malchus; and when\nhe denied it, he showed his letter to the Sanhedrim, and put the man to\ndeath immediately.", "And this account we give the reader, as it is contained in the commentaries\nof king Herod: but other historians do not agree with them, for they suppose\nthat Herod did not find, but rather make, this an occasion for thus putting\nhim to death, and that by treacherously laying a snare for him; for thus\ndo they write: That Herod and he were once at a treat, and that Herod had\ngiven no occasion to suspect [that he was displeased at him], but put this\nquestion to Hyrcanus, Whether he had received any letters from Malchus?\nand when he answered that he had received letters, but those of salutation\nonly; and when he asked further, whether he had not received any presents\nfrom him? and when he had replied that he had received no more than four\nhorses to ride on, which Malchus had sent him; they pretended that Herod\ncharged these upon him as the crimes of bribery and treason, and gave order\nthat he should be led away and slain. And in order to demonstrate that\nhe had been guilty of no offense, when he was thus brought to his end,\nthey alleged how mild his temper had been, and that even in his youth he\nhad never given any demonstration of boldness or rashness, and that the\ncase was the same when he came to be king, but that he even then committed\nthe management of the greatest part of public affairs to Antipater; and\nthat he was now above fourscore years old, and knew that Herod's government\nwas in a secure state. He also came over Euphrates, and left those who\ngreatly honored him beyond that river, though he were to be entirely under\nHerod's government; and that it was a most incredible thing that he should\nenterprise any thing by way of innovation, and not at all agreeable to\nhis temper, but that this was a plot of Herod's contrivance.", "And this was the fate of Hyrcanus; and thus did he end his life,\nafter he had endured various and manifold turns of fortune in his lifetime.\nFor he was made high priest of the Jewish nation in the beginning of his\nmother Alexandra's reign, who held the government nine years; and when,\nafter his mother's death, he took the kingdom himself, and held it three\nmonths, he lost it, by the means of his brother Aristobulus. He was then\nrestored by Pompey, and received all sorts of honor from him, and enjoyed\nthem forty years; but when he was again deprived by Antigonus, and was\nmaimed in his body, he was made a captive by the Parthians, and thence\nreturned home again after some time, on account of the hopes that Herod\nhad given him; none of which came to pass according to his expectation,\nbut he still conflicted with many misfortunes through the whole course\nof his life; and, what was the heaviest calamity of all, as we have related\nalready, he came to an end which was undeserved by him. His character appeared\nto be that of a man of a mild and moderate disposition, and suffered the\nadministration of affairs to be generally done by others under him. He\nwas averse to much meddling with the public, nor had shrewdness enough\nto govern a kingdom. And both Antipater and Herod came to their greatness\nby reason of his mildness; and at last he met with such an end from them\nas was not agreeable either to justice or piety.", "Now Herod, as soon as he had put Hyrcanus out of the way, made haste\nto Caesar; and because he could not have any hopes of kindness from him,\non account of the friendship he had for Antony, he had a suspicion of Alexandra,\nlest she should take this opportunity to bring the multitude to a revolt,\nand introduce a sedition into the affairs of the kingdom; so he committed\nthe care of every thing to his brother Pheroras, and placed his mother\nCypros, and his sister [Salome], and the whole family at Masada, and gave\nhim a charge, that if he should hear any sad news about him, he should\ntake care of the government. But as to Mariamne his wife, because of the\nmisunderstanding between her and his sister, and his sister's mother, which\nmade it impossible for them to live together, he placed her at Alexandrium,\nwith Alexandra her mother, and left his treasurer Joseph and Sohemus of\nIturea to take care of that fortress. These two had been very faithful\nto him from the beginning, and were now left as a guard to the women. They\nalso had it in charge, that if they should hear any mischief had befallen\nhim, they should kill them both, and, as far as they were able, to preserve\nthe kingdom for his sons, and for his brother Pheroras.", "When he had given them this charge, he made haste to Rhodes, to meet\nCaesar; and when he had sailed to that city, he took off his diadem, but\nremitted nothing else of his usual dignity. And when, upon his meeting\nhim, he desired that he would let him speak to him, he therein exhibited\na much more noble specimen of a great soul; for he did not betake himself\nto supplications, as men usually do upon such occasions, nor offered him\nany petition, as if he were an offender; but, after an undaunted manner,\ngave an account of what he had done; for he spake thus to Caesar: That\nhe had the greatest friendship for Antony, and did every thing he could\nthat he might attain the government; that he was not indeed in the army\nwith him, because the Arabians had diverted him; but that he had sent him\nboth money and corn, which was but too little in comparison of what he\nought to have done for him; \"for if a man owns himself to be another's\nfriend, and knows him to be a benefactor, he is obliged to hazard every\nthing, to use every faculty of his soul, every member of his body, and\nall the wealth he hath, for him, in which I confess I have been too deficient.\nHowever, I am conscious to myself, that so far I have done right, that\nI have not deserted him upon his defeat at Actium; nor upon the evident\nchange of his fortune have I transferred my hopes from him to another,\nbut have preserved myself, though not as a valuable fellow soldier, yet\ncertainly as a faithful counselor, to Antony, when I demonstrated to him\nthat the only way that he had to save himself, and not to lose all his\nauthority, was to slay Cleopatra; for when she was once dead, there would\nbe room for him to retain his authority, and rather to bring thee to make\na composition with him, than to continue at enmity any longer. None of\nwhich advises would he attend to, but preferred his own rash resolution\nbefore them, which have happened unprofitably for him, but profitably for\nthee. Now, therefore, in case thou determinest about me, and my alacrity\nin serving Antony, according to thy anger at him, I own there is no room\nfor me to deny what I have done, nor will I be ashamed to own, and that\npublicly too, that I had a great kindness for him. But if thou wilt put\nhim out of the case, and only examine how I behave myself to my benefactors\nin general, and what sort of friend I am, thou wilt find by experience\nthat we shall do and be the same to thyself, for it is but changing the\nnames, and the firmness of friendship that we shall bear to thee will not\nbe disapproved by thee.\"", "By this speech, and by his behavior, which showed Caesar the frankness\nof his mind, he greatly gained upon him, who was himself of a generous\nand magnificent temper, insomuch that those very actions, which were the\nfoundation of the accusation against him, procured him Caesar's good-will.\nAccordingly, he restored him his diadem again; and encouraged him to exhibit\nhimself as great a friend to himself as he had been to Antony, and then\nhad him in great esteem. Moreover, he added this, that Quintus Didius had\nwritten to him that Herod had very readily assisted him in the affair of\nthe gladiators. So when he had obtained such a kind reception, and had,\nbeyond all his hopes, procured his crown to be more entirely and firmly\nsettled upon him than ever by Caesar's donation, as well as by that decree\nof the Romans, which Caesar took care to procure for his greater security,\nhe conducted Caesar on his way to Egypt, and made presents, even beyond\nhis ability, to both him and his friends, and in general behaved himself\nwith great magnanimity. He also desired that Caesar would not put to death\none Alexander, who had been a companion of Antony; but Caesar had sworn\nto put him to death, and so he could not obtain that his petition. And\nnow he returned to Judea again with greater honor and assurance than ever,\nand affrighted those that had expectations to the contrary, as still acquiring\nfrom his very dangers greater splendor than before, by the favor of God\nto him. So he prepared for the reception of Caesar, as he was going out\nof Syria to invade Egypt; and when he came, he entertained him at Ptolemais\nwith all royal magnificence. He also bestowed presents on the army, and\nbrought them provisions in abundance. He also proved to be one of Caesar's\nmost cordial friends, and put the army in array, and rode along with Caesar,\nand had a hundred and fifty men, well appointed in all respects, after\na rich and sumptuous manner, for the better reception of him and his friends.\nHe also provided them with what they should want, as they passed over the\ndry desert, insomuch that they lacked neither wine nor water, which last\nthe soldiers stood in the greatest need of; and besides, he presented Caesar\nwith eight hundred talents, and procured to himself the good-will of them\nall, because he was assisting to them in a much greater and more splendid\ndegree than the kingdom he had obtained could afford; by which means he\nmore and more demonstrated to Caesar the firmness of his friendship, and\nhis readiness to assist him; and what was of the greatest advantage to\nhim was this, that his liberality came at a seasonable time also. And when\nthey returned again out of Egypt, his assistances were no way inferior\nto the good offices he had formerly done them.", "HOWEVER, when he came into his kingdom again, he found his house\nall in disorder, and his wife Mariamne and her mother Alexandra very uneasy;\nfor as they supposed (what was easy to be supposed) that they were not\nput into that fortress [Alexandrium] for the security of their persons,\nbut as into a garrison for their imprisonment, and that they had no power\nover any thing, either of others or of their own affairs, they were very\nuneasy; and Mariamne supposing that the king's love to her was but hypocritical,\nand rather pretended (as advantageous to himself) than real, she looked\nupon it as fallacious. She also was grieved that he would not allow her\nany hopes of surviving him, if he should come to any harm himself. She\nalso recollected what commands he had formerly given to Joseph, insomuch\nthat she endeavored to please her keepers, and especially Sohemus, as well\napprized how all was in his power. And at the first Sohemus was faithful\nto Herod, and neglected none of the things he had given him in charge;\nbut when the women, by kind words and liberal presents, had gained his\naffections over to them, he was by degrees overcome, and at length discovered\nto them all the king's injunctions, and this on that account principally,\nthat he did not so much as hope he would come back with the same authority\nhe had before; so that he thought he should both escape any danger from\nhim, mid supposed that he did hereby much gratify the women, who were likely\nnot to be overlooked in the settling of the government; nay, that they\nwould be able to make him abundant recompense, since they must either reign\nthemselves, or be very near to him that should reign. He had a further\nground of hope also, that though Herod should have all the success he could\nwish for, and should return again, he could not contradict his wife in\nwhat she desired, for he knew that the king's fondness for his wife was\ninexpressible. These were the motives that drew Sohemus to discover what\ninjunctions had been given him. So Mariamne was greatly displeased to hear\nthat there was no end of the dangers she was under from Herod, and was\ngreatly uneasy at it, and wished that he might obtain no favors [from Caesar],\nand esteemed it almost an insupportable task to live with him any longer;\nand this she afterward openly declared, without concealing her resentment.", "And now Herod sailed home with joy, at the unexpected good success\nhe had had; and went first of all, as was proper, to this his wife, and\ntold her, and her only, the good news, as preferring her before the rest,\non account of his fondness for her, and the intimacy there had been between\nthem, and saluted her; but so it happened, that as he told her of the good\nsuccess he had had, she was so far from rejoicing at it, that she rather\nwas sorry for it; nor was she able to conceal her resentments, but, depending\non her dignity, and the nobility of her birth, in return for his salutations,\nshe gave a groan, and declared evidently that she rather grieved than rejoiced\nat his success, and this till Herod was disturbed at her, as affording\nhim, not only marks of her suspicion, but evident signs of her dissatisfaction.\nThis much troubled him, to see that this surprising hatred of his wife\nto him was not concealed, but open; and he took this so ill, and yet was\nso unable to bear it, on account of the fondness he had for her, that he\ncould not continue long in any one mind, but sometimes was angry at her,\nand sometimes reconciled himself to her; but by always changing one passion\nfor another, he was still in great uncertainty, and thus was he entangled\nbetween hatred and love, and was frequently disposed to inflict punishment\non her for her insolence towards him; but being deeply in love with her\nin his soul, he was not able to get quit of this woman. In short, as he\nwould gladly have her punished, so was he afraid lest, ere he were aware,\nhe should, by putting her to death, bring a heavier punishment upon himself\nat the same time.", "When Herod's sister and mother perceived that he was in this temper\nwith regard to Mariamne they thought they had now got an excellent opportunity\nto exercise their hatred against her and provoked Herod to wrath by telling\nhim, such long stories and calumnies about her, as might at once excite\nhis hatred and his jealousy. Now, though he willingly enough heard their\nwords, yet had not he courage enough to do any thing to her as if he believed\nthem; but still he became worse and worse disposed to her, and these ill\npassions were more and more inflamed on both sides, while she did not hide\nher disposition towards him, and he turned his love to her into wrath against\nher. But when he was just going to put this matter past all remedy, he\nheard the news that Caesar was the victor in the war, and that Antony and\nCleopatra were both dead, and that he had conquered Egypt; whereupon he\nmade haste to go to meet Caesar, and left the affairs of his family in\ntheir present state. However, Mariamne recommended Sohemus to him, as he\nwas setting out on his journey, and professed that she owed him thanks\nfor the care he had taken of her, and asked of the king for him a place\nin the government; upon which an honorable employment was bestowed upon\nhim accordingly. Now when Herod was come into Egypt, he was introduced\nto Caesar with great freedom, as already a friend of his, and received\nvery great favors from him; for he made him a present of those four hundred\nGalatians who had been Cleopatra's guards, and restored that country to\nhim again, which, by her means, had been taken away from him. He also added\nto his kingdom Gadara, Hippos, and Samaria; and, besides those, the maritime\ncities, Gaza, and Anthedon, and Joppa, and Strato's Tower.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Whereas Mariamne is here represented as reproaching: Herod with the murder\nof her father [Alexander], as well as her brother [Aristobulus], while\nit was her grandfather Hyrcanus, and not her father Alexander, whom he\ncaused to be slain, (as Josephus himself informs us, ch. 6. sect. 2,) we\nmust either take Zonaras's reading, which is here grandfather, rightly,\nor else we must, as before, ch. 1. sect. 1, allow a slip of Josephus's\npen or memory in the place before us."}, "#text": "Upon these new acquisitions, he grew more magnificent, and conducted\nCaesar as far as Antioch; but upon his return, as much as his prosperity\nwas augmented by the foreign additions that had been made him, so much\nthe greater were the distresses that came upon him in his own family, and\nchiefly in the affair of his wife, wherein he formerly appeared to have\nbeen most of all fortunate; for the affection he had for Mariamne was no\nway inferior to the affections of such as are on that account celebrated\nin history, and this very justly. As for her, she was in other respects\na chaste woman, and faithful to him; yet had she somewhat of a woman rough\nby nature, and treated her husband imperiously enough, because she saw\nhe was so fond of her as to be enslaved to her. She did not also consider\nseasonably with herself that she lived under a monarchy, and that she was\nat another's disposal, and accordingly would behave herself after a saucy\nmanner to him, which yet he usually put off in a jesting way, and bore\nwith moderation and good temper. She would also expose his mother and his\nsister openly, on account of the meanness of their birth, and would speak\nunkindly of them, insomuch that there was before this a disagreement and\nunpardonable hatred among the women, and it was now come to greater reproaches\nof one another than formerly, which suspicions increased, and lasted a\nwhole year after Herod returned from Caesar. However, these misfortunes,\nwhich had been kept under some decency for a great while, burst out all\nat once upon such an occasion as was now offered; for as the king was one\nday about noon lain down on his bed to rest him, he called for Mariamne,\nout of the great affection he had always for her. She came in accordingly,\nbut would not lie down by him; and when he was very desirous of her company,\nshe showed her contempt of him; and added, by way of reproach, that he\nhad caused her father and her brother to be slain. \nAnd when he took this injury very unkindly, and was ready to use violence\nto her, in a precipitate manner, the king's sister Salome, observing that\nhe was more than ordinarily disturbed, sent in to the king his cup-bearer,\nwho had been prepared long beforehand for such a design, and bid him tell\nthe king how Mariamne had persuaded him to give his assistance in preparing\na love potion for him; and if he appeared to be greatly concerned, and\nto ask what that love potion was, to tell him that she had the potion,\nand that he was desired only to give it him; but that in case he did not\nappear to be much concerned at this potion, to let the thing drop; and\nthat if he did so, no harm should thereby come to him. When she had given\nhim these instructions, she sent him in at this time to make such a speech.\nSo he went in, after a composed manner, to gain credit to what he should\nsay, and yet somewhat hastily, and said that Mariamne had given him presents,\nand persuaded him to give him a love potion. And when this moved the king,\nhe said that this love potion was a composition that she had given him,\nwhose effects he did not know, which was the reason of his resolving to\ngive him this information, as the safest course he could take, both for\nhimself and for the king. When Herod heard what he said, and was in an\nill disposition before, his indignation grew more violent; and he ordered\nthat eunuch of Mariamne, who was most faithful to her, to be brought to\ntorture about this potion, as well knowing it was not possible that any\nthing small or great could be done without him. And when the man was under\nthe utmost agonies, he could say nothing concerning the thing he was tortured\nabout, but so far he knew, that Mariamne's hatred against him was occasioned\nby somewhat that Sohemus had said to her. Now as he was saying this, Herod\ncried out aloud, and said that Sohemus, who had been at all other times\nmost faithful to him, and to his government, would not have betrayed what\ninjunctions he had given him, unless he had had a nearer conversation than\nordinary with Mariamne. So he gave order that Sohemus should be seized\non and slain immediately; but he allowed his wife to take her trial; and\ngot together those that were most faithful to him, and laid an elaborate\naccusation against her for this love potion and composition, which had\nbeen charged upon her by way of calumny only. However, he kept no temper\nin what he said, and was in too great a passion for judging well about\nthis matter. Accordingly, when the court was at length satisfied that he\nwas so resolved, they passed the sentence of death upon her; but when the\nsentence was passed upon her, this temper was suggested by himself, and\nby some others of the court, that she should not be thus hastily put to\ndeath, but be laid in prison in one of the fortresses belonging to the\nkingdom: but Salome and her party labored hard to have the woman put to\ndeath; and they prevailed with the king to do so, and advised this out\nof caution, lest the multitude should be tumultuous if she were suffered\nto live; and thus was Mariamne led to execution."}, "When Alexandra observed how things went, and that there were small\nhopes that she herself should escape the like treatment from Herod, she\nchanged her behavior to quite the reverse of what might have been expected\nfrom her former boldness, and this after a very indecent manner; for out\nof her desire to show how entirely ignorant she was of the crimes laid\nagainst Mariamne, she leaped out of her place, and reproached her daughter\nin the hearing of all the people; and cried out that she had been an ill\nwoman, and ungrateful to her husband, and that her punishment came justly\nupon her for such her insolent behavior, for that she had not made proper\nreturns to him who had been their common benefactor. And when she had for\nsome time acted after this hypocritical manner, and been so outrageous\nas to tear her hair, this indecent and dissembling behavior, as was to\nbe expected, was greatly condemned by the rest of the spectators, as it\nwas principally by the poor woman who was to suffer; for at the first she\ngave her not a word, nor was discomposed at her peevishness, and only looked\nat her, yet did she out of a greatness of soul discover her concern for\nher mother's offense, and especially for her exposing herself in a manner\nso unbecoming her; but as for herself, she went to her death with an unshaken\nfirmness of mind, and without changing the color of her face, and thereby\nevidently discovered the nobility of her descent to the spectators, even\nin the last moments of her life.", "And thus died Mariamne, a woman of an excellent character, both for\nchastity and greatness of soul; but she wanted moderation, and had too\nmuch of contention in her nature; yet had she all that can be said in the\nbeauty of her body, and her majestic appearance in conversation; and thence\narose the greatest part of the occasions why she did not prove so agreeable\nto the king, nor live so pleasantly with him, as she might otherwise have\ndone; for while she was most indulgently used by the king, out of his fondness\nfor her, and did not expect that he could do any hard thing to her, she\ntook too unbounded a liberty. Moreover, that which most afflicted her was,\nwhat he had done to her relations, and she ventured to speak of all they\nhad suffered by him, and at last greatly provoked both the king's mother\nand sister, till they became enemies to her; and even he himself also did\nthe same, on whom alone she depended for her expectations of escaping the\nlast of punishments.", "But when she was once dead, the king's affections for her were kindled\nin a more outrageous manner than before, whose old passion for her we have\nalready described; for his love to her was not of a calm nature, nor such\nas we usually meet with among other husbands; for at its commencement it\nwas of an enthusiastic kind, nor was it by their long cohabitation and\nfree conversation together brought under his power to manage; but at this\ntime his love to Mariamne seemed to seize him in such a peculiar manner,\nas looked like Divine vengeance upon him for the taking away her life;\nfor he would frequently call for her, and frequently lament for her in\na most indecent manner. Moreover, he bethought him of every thing he could\nmake use of to divert his mind from thinking of her, and contrived feasts\nand assemblies for that purpose, but nothing would suffice; he therefore\nlaid aside the administration of public affairs, and was so far conquered\nby his passion, that he would order his servants to call for Mariamne,\nas if she were still alive, and could still hear them. And when he was\nin this way, there arose a pestilential disease, and carried off the greatest\npart of the multitude, and of his best and most esteemed friends, and made\nall men suspect that this was brought upon them by the anger of God, for\nthe injustice that had been done to Mariamne. This circumstance affected\nthe king still more, till at length he forced himself to go into desert\nplaces, and there, under pretense of going a hunting, bitterly afflicted\nhimself; yet had he not borne his grief there many days before he fell\ninto a most dangerous distemper himself: he had an inflammation upon him,\nand a pain in the hinder part of his head, joined with madness; and for\nthe remedies that were used, they did him no good at all, but proved contrary\nto his case, and so at length brought him to despair. All the physicians\nalso that were about him, partly because the medicines they brought for\nhis recovery could not at all conquer the disease, and partly because his\ndiet could be no other than what his disease inclined him to, desired him\nto eat whatever he had a mind to, and so left the small hopes they had\nof his recovery in the power of that diet, and committed him to fortune.\nAnd thus did his distemper go on, while he was at Samaria, now called Sebaste.", "Now Alexandra abode at this time at Jerusalem; and being informed\nwhat condition Herod was in, she endeavored to get possession of the fortified\nplaces that were about the city, which were two, the one belonging to the\ncity itself, the other belonging to the temple; and those that could get\nthem into their hands had the whole nation under their power, for without\nthe command of them it was not possible to offer their sacrifices; and\nto think of leaving on those sacrifices is to every Jew plainly impossible,\nwho are still more ready to lose their lives than to leave off that Divine\nworship which they have been wont to pay unto God. Alexandra, therefore,\ndiscoursed with those that had the keeping of these strong holds, that\nit was proper for them to deliver the same to her, and to Herod's sons,\nlest, upon his death, any other person should seize upon the government;\nand that upon his recovery none could keep them more safely for him than\nthose of his own family. These words were not by them at all taken in good\npart; and as they had been in former times faithful [to Herod], they resolved\nto continue so more than ever, both because they hated Alexandra, and because\nthey thought it a sort of impiety to despair of Herod's recovery while\nhe was yet alive, for they had been his old friends; and one of them, whose\nname was Achiabus, was his cousin-german. They sent messengers therefore\nto acquaint him with Alexandra's design; so he made no longer delay, but\ngave orders to have her slain; yet was it still with difficulty, and after\nhe had endured great pain, that he got clear of his distemper. He was still\nsorely afflicted, both in mind and body, and made very uneasy, and readier\nthan ever upon all occasions to inflict punishment upon those that fell\nunder his hand. He also slew the most intimate of his friends, Costobarus,\nand Lysimachus, and Cadias, who was also called Antipater; as also Dositheus,\nand that upon the following occasion.", "Costobarus was an Idumean by birth, and one of principal dignity\namong them, and one whose ancestors had been priests to the Koze, whom\nthe Idumeans had [formerly] esteemed as a god; but after Hyrcanus had made\na change in their political government, and made them receive the Jewish\ncustoms and law, Herod made Costobarus governor of Idumea and Gaza, and\ngave him his sister Salome to wife; and this was upon the slaughter of\n[his uncle] Joseph, who had that government before, as we have related\nalready. When Costobarus had gotten to be so highly advanced, it pleased\nhim and was more than he hoped for, and he was more and more puffed up\nby his good success, and in a little while he exceeded all bounds, and\ndid not think fit to obey what Herod, as their ruler, commanded him, or\nthat the Idumeans should make use of the Jewish customs, or be subject\nto them. He therefore sent to Cleopatra, and informed her that the Idumeans\nhad been always under his progenitors, and that for the same reason it\nwas but just that she should desire that country for him of Antony, for\nthat he was ready to transfer his friendship to her; and this he did, not\nbecause he was better pleased to be under Cleopatra's government, but because\nhe thought that, upon the diminution of Herod's power, it would not be\ndifficult for him to obtain himself the entire government over the Idumeans,\nand somewhat more also; for he raised his hopes still higher, as having\nno small pretenses, both by his birth and by these riches which he had\ngotten by his constant attention to filthy lucre; and accordingly it was\nnot a small matter that he aimed at. So Cleopatra desired this country\nof Antony, but failed of her purpose. An account of this was brought to\nHerod, who was thereupon ready to kill Costobarus; yet, upon the entreaties\nof his sister and mother, he forgave him, and vouchsafed to pardon him\nentirely; though he still had a suspicion of him afterward for this his\nattempt.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Here is a plain example of a Jewish lady giving a bill of divorce to her\nhusband, though in the days of Josephus it was not esteemed lawful for\na woman so to do.

However, Salome chose to follow\nnot the law of her country, but the law of her authority, and so renounced\nher wedlock; and told her brother Herod, that she left her husband out\nof her good-will to him, because she perceived that he, with Antipater,\nand Lysimachus, and Dositheus, were raising a sedition against him; as\nan evidence whereof, she alleged the case of the sons of Babas, that they\nhad been by him preserved alive already for the interval of twelve years;\nwhich proved to be true. But when Herod thus unexpectedly heard of it,\nhe was greatly surprised at it, and was the more surprised, because the\nrelation appeared incredible to him. As for the fact relating to these\nsons of Babas, Herod had formerly taken great pains to bring them to punishment,\nas being enemies to his government; but they were now forgotten by him,\non account of the length of time [since he had ordered them to be slain].\nNow the cause of his ill-will and hatred to them arose hence, that while\nAntigonus was king, Herod, with his army, besieged the city of Jerusalem,\nwhere the distress and miseries which the besieged endured were so pressing,\nthat the greater number of them invited Herod into the city, and already\nplaced their hopes on him. Now the sons of Babas were of great dignity,\nand had power among the multitude, and were faithful to Antigonus, and\nwere always raising calumnies against Herod, and encouraged the people\nto preserve the government to that royal family which held it by inheritance.\nSo these men acted thus politically, and, as they thought, for their own\nadvantage; but when the city was taken, and Herod had gotten the government\ninto his hands, and Costobarus was appointed to hinder men from passing\nout at the gates, and to guard the city, that those citizens that were\nguilty, and of the party opposite to the king, might not get out of it,\nCostobarus, being sensible that the sons of Babas were had in respect and\nhonor by the whole multitude, and supposing that their preservation might\nbe of great advantage to him in the changes of government afterward, he\nset them by themselves, and concealed them in his own farms; and when the\nthing was suspected, he assured Herod upon oath that he really knew nothing\nof that matter, and so overcame the suspicions that lay upon him; nay,\nafter that, when the king had publicly proposed a reward for the discovery,\nand had put in practice all sorts of methods for searching out this matter,\nhe would not confess it; but being persuaded that when he had at first\ndenied it, if the men were found, he should not escape unpunished, he was\nforced to keep them secret, not only out of his good-will to them, but\nout of a necessary regard to his own preservation also. But when the king\nknew the thing, by his sister's information, he sent men to the places\nwhere he had the intimation they were concealed, and ordered both them,\nand those that were accused as guilty with them, to be slain, insomuch\nthat there were now none at all left of the kindred of Hyrcanus, and the\nkingdom was entirely in Herod's own power, and there was nobody remaining\nof such dignity as could put a stop to what he did against the Jewish laws."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "These grand plays, and shows, and Thymelici, or music meetings, and chariot\nraces, when the chariots were drawn by two, three, or four pair of horses,\netc., instituted by Herod in his theatres, were still, as we see here,\nlooked on by the sober Jews as heathenish sports, and tending to corrupt\nthe manners of the Jewish nation, and to bring them in love with paganish\nidolatry, and paganish conduct of life, but to the dissolution of the law\nof Moses, and accordingly were greatly and justly condemned by them, as\nappears here and every where else in Josephus.

Both of them were indeed\ncostly works, but opposite to the Jewish customs; for we have had no such\nshows delivered down to us as fit to be used or exhibited by us; yet did\nhe celebrate these games every five years, in the most solemn and splendid\nmanner. He also made proclamation to the neighboring countries, and called\nmen together out of every nation. The wrestlers also, and the rest of those\nthat strove for the prizes in such games, were invited out of every land,\nboth by the hopes of the rewards there to be bestowed, and by the glory\nof victory to be there gained. So the principal persons that were the most\neminent in these sorts of exercises were gotten together, for there were\nvery great rewards for victory proposed, not only to those that performed\ntheir exercises naked, but to those that played the musicians also, and\nwere called Thymelici; and he spared no pains to induce all persons, the\nmost famous for such exercises, to come to this contest for victory. He\nalso proposed no small rewards to those who ran for the prizes in chariot\nraces, when they were drawn by two, or three, or four pair of horses. He\nalso imitated every thing, though never so costly or magnificent, in other\nnations, out of an ambition that he might give most public demonstration\nof his grandeur. Inscriptions also of the great actions of Caesar, and\ntrophies of those nations which he had conquered in his wars, and all made\nof the purest gold and silver, encompassed the theater itself; nor was\nthere any thing that could be subservient to his design, whether it were\nprecious garments, or precious stones set in order, which was not also\nexposed to sight in these games. He had also made a great preparation of\nwild beasts, and of lions themselves in great abundance, and of such other\nbeasts as were either of uncommon strength, or of such a sort as were rarely\nseen. These were prepared either to fight with one another, or that men\nwho were condemned to death were to fight with them. And truly foreigners\nwere greatly surprised and delighted at the vastness of the expenses here\nexhibited, and at the great dangers that were here seen; but to natural\nJews, this was no better than a dissolution of those customs for which\nthey had so great a veneration. \nIt appeared also no better than an instance of barefaced impiety, to throw\nmen to wild beasts, for the affording delight to the spectators; and it\nappeared an instance of no less impiety, to change their own laws for such\nforeign exercises: but, above all the rest, the trophies gave most distaste\nto the Jews; for as they imagined them to be images, included within the\narmor that hung round about them, they were sorely displeased at them,\nbecause it was not the custom of their country to pay honors to such images."}, "Nor was Herod unacquainted with the disturbance they were under;\nand as he thought it unseasonable to use violence with them, so he spake\nto some of them by way of consolation, and in order to free them from that\nsuperstitious fear they were under; yet could not he satisfy them, but\nthey cried out with one accord, out of their great uneasiness at the offenses\nthey thought he had been guilty of, that although they should think of\nbearing all the rest yet would they never bear images of men in their city,\nmeaning the trophies, because this was disagreeable to the laws of their\ncountry. Now when Herod saw them in such a disorder, and that they would\nnot easily change their resolution unless they received satisfaction in\nthis point, he called to him the most eminent men among them, and brought\nthem upon the theater, and showed them the trophies, and asked them what\nsort of things they took these trophies to be; and when they cried out\nthat they were the images of men, he gave order that they should be stripped\nof these outward ornaments which were about them, and showed them the naked\npieces of wood; which pieces of wood, now without any ornament, became\nmatter of great sport and laughter to them, because they had before always\nhad the ornaments of images themselves in derision.", "When therefore Herod had thus got clear of the multitude, and had\ndissipated the vehemency of passion under which they had been, the greatest\npart of the people were disposed to change their conduct, and not to be\ndispleased at him any longer; but still some of them continued in their\ndispleasure against him, for his introduction of new customs, and esteemed\nthe violation of the laws of their country as likely to be the origin of\nvery great mischiefs to them, so that they deemed it an instance of piety\nrather to hazard themselves [to be put to death], than to seem as if they\ntook no notice of Herod, who, upon the change he had made in their government,\nintroduced such customs, and that in a violent manner, which they had never\nbeen used to before, as indeed in pretense a king, but in reality one that\nshowed himself an enemy to their whole nation; on which account ten men\nthat were citizens [of Jerusalem] conspired together against him, and sware\nto one another to undergo any dangers in the attempt, and took daggers\nwith them under their garments [for the purpose of killing Herod]. Now\nthere was a certain blind man among those conspirators who had thus sworn\nto one another, on account of the indignation he had against what he heard\nto have been done; he was not indeed able to afford the rest any assistance\nin the undertaking, but was ready to undergo any suffering with them, if\nso be they should come to any harm, insomuch that he became a very great\nencourager of the rest of the undertakers.", "When they had taken this resolution, and that by common consent,\nthey went into the theater, hoping that, in the first place, Herod himself\ncould not escape them, as they should fall upon him so unexpectedly; and\nsupposing, however, that if they missed him, they should kill a great many\nof those that were about him; and this resolution they took, though they\nshould die for it, in order to suggest to the king what injuries he had\ndone to the multitude. These conspirators, therefore, standing thus prepared\nbeforehand, went about their design with great alacrity; but there was\none of those spies of Herod, that were appointed for such purposes, to\nfish out and inform him of any conspiracies that should be made against\nhim, who found out the whole affair, and told the king of it, as he was\nabout to go into the theater. So when he reflected on the hatred which\nhe knew the greatest part of the people bore him, and on the disturbances\nthat arose upon every occasion, he thought this plot against him not to\nbe improbable. Accordingly, he retired into his palace, and called those\nthat were accused of this conspiracy before him by their several names;\nand as, upon the guards falling upon them, they were caught in the very\nfact, and knew they could not escape, they prepared themselves for their\nends with all the decency they could, and so as not at all to recede from\ntheir resolute behavior, for they showed no shame for what they were about,\nnor denied it; but when they were seized, they showed their daggers, and\nprofessed that the conspiracy they had sworn to was a holy and pious action;\nthat what they intended to do was not for gain, or out of any indulgence\nto their passions, but principally for those common customs of their country,\nwhich all the Jews were obliged to observe, or to die for them. This was\nwhat these men said, out of their undaunted courage in this conspiracy.\nSo they were led away to execution by the king's guards that stood about\nthem, and patiently underwent all the torments inflicted on them till they\ndied. Nor was it long before that spy who had discovered them was seized\non by some of the people, out of the hatred they bore to him; and was not\nonly slain by them, but pulled to pieces, limb from limb, and given to\nthe dogs. This execution was seen by many of the citizens, yet would not\none of them discover the doers of it, till upon Herod's making a strict\nscrutiny after them, by bitter and severe tortures, certain women that\nwere tortured confessed what they had seen done; the authors of which fact\nwere so terribly punished by the king, that their entire families were\ndestroyed for this their rash attempt; yet did not the obstinacy of the\npeople, and that undaunted constancy they showed in the defense of their\nlaws, make Herod any easier to them, but he still strengthened himself\nafter a more secure manner, and resolved to encompass the multitude every\nway, lest such innovations should end in an open rebellion.", "Since, therefore, he had now the city fortified by the palace in\nwhich he lived, and by the temple which had a strong fortress by it, called\nAntonia, and was rebuilt by himself, he contrived to make Samaria a fortress\nfor himself also against all the people, and called it Sebaste, supposing\nthat this place would be a strong hold against the country, not inferior\nto the former. So he fortified that place, which was a day's journey distant\nfrom Jerusalem, and which would be useful to him in common, to keep both\nthe country and the city in awe. He also built another fortress for the\nwhole nation; it was of old called Strato's Tower, but was by him named\nCesarea. Moreover, he chose out some select horsemen, and placed them ill\nthe great plain; and built [for them] a place in Galilee, called Gaba with\nHesebonitis, in Perea. And these were the places which he particularly\nbuilt, while he always was inventing somewhat further for his own security,\nand encompassing the whole nation with guards, that they might by no means\nget from under his power, nor fall into tumults, which they did continually\nupon any small commotion; and that if they did make any commotions, he\nmight know of it, while some of his spies might be upon them from the neighborhood,\nand might both be able to know what they were attempting, and to prevent\nit. And when he went about building the wall of Samaria, he contrived to\nbring thither many of those that had been assisting to him in his wars,\nand many of the people in that neighborhood also, whom he made fellow citizens\nwith the rest. This he did out of an ambitious desire of building a temple,\nand out of a desire to make the city more eminent than it had been before;\nbut principally because he contrived that it might at once be for his own\nsecurity, and a monument of his magnificence. He also changed its name,\nand called it Sebaste. Moreover, he parted the adjoining country, which\nwas excellent in its kind, among the inhabitants of Samaria, that they\nmight be in a happy condition, upon their first coming to inhabit. Besides\nall which, he encompassed the city with a wall of great strength, and made\nuse of the acclivity of the place for making its fortifications stronger;\nnor was the compass of the place made now so small as it had been before,\nbut was such as rendered it not inferior to the most famous cities; for\nit was twenty furlongs in circumference. Now within, and about the middle\nof it, he built a sacred place, of a furlong and a half [in circuit], and\nadorned it with all sorts of decorations, and therein erected a temple,\nwhich was illustrious on account of both its largeness and beauty. And\nas to the several parts of the city, he adorned them with decorations of\nall sorts also; and as to what was necessary to provide for his own security,\nhe made the walls very strong for that purpose, and made it for the greatest\npart a citadel; and as to the elegance of the building, it was taken care\nof also, that he might leave monuments of the fineness of his taste, and\nof his beneficence, to future ages.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Here we have an eminent example of the language of Josephus in his writing\nto Gentiles, different from that when he wrote to Jews; in his writing\nto whom he still derives all such judgments from the anger of God; but\nbecause he knew many of the Gentiles thought they might naturally come\nin certain periods, he complies with them in the following sentence.

When therefore the fruits of that year were spoiled, and\nwhatsoever they had laid up beforehand was spent, there was no foundation\nof hope for relief remaining, but the misery, contrary to what they expected\nstill increased upon them; and this not only on that year, while they had\nnothing for themselves left [at the end of it], but what seed they had\nsown perished also, by reason of the ground not yielding its fruits on\nthe second year. \nThis distress they were in made them also, out of necessity, to eat many\nthings that did not use to be eaten; nor was the king himself free from\nthis distress any more than other men, as being deprived of that tribute\nhe used to have from the fruits of the ground, and having already expended\nwhat money he had, in his liberality to those whose cities he had built;\nnor had he any people that were worthy of his assistance, since this miserable\nstate of things had procured him the hatred of his subjects: for it is\na constant rule, that misfortunes are still laid to the account of those\nthat govern."}, "In these circumstances he considered with himself how to procure\nsome seasonable help; but this was a hard thing to be done, while their\nneighbors had no food to sell them; and their money also was gone, had\nit been possible to purchase a little food at a great price. However, he\nthought it his best way, by all means, not to leave off his endeavors to\nassist his people; so he cut off the rich furniture that was in his palace,\nboth of silver and gold, insomuch that he did not spare the finest vessels\nhe had, or those that were made with the most elaborate skill of the artificers,\nbut sent the money to Petronius, who had been made prefect of Egypt by\nCaesar; and as not a few had already fled to him under their necessities,\nand as he was particularly a friend to Herod, and desirous to have his\nsubjects preserved, he gave leave to them in the first place to export\ncorn, and assisted them every way, both in purchasing and exporting the\nsame; so that he was the principal, if not the only person, who afforded\nthem what help they had. And Herod taking care the people should understand\nthat this help came from himself, did thereby not only remove the ill opinion\nof those that formerly hated him, but gave them the greatest demonstration\npossible of his good-will to them, and care of them; for, in the first\nplace, as for those who were able to provide their own food, he distributed\nto them their proportion of corn in the exactest manner; but for those\nmany that were not able, either by reason of their old age, or any other\ninfirmity, to provide food for themselves, he made this provision for them,\nthe bakers should make their bread ready for them. He also took care that\nthey might not be hurt by the dangers of winter, since they were in great\nwant of clothing also, by reason of the utter destruction and consumption\nof their sheep and goats, till they had no wool to make use of, nor any\nthing else to cover themselves withal. And when he had procured these things\nfor his own subjects, he went further, in order to provide necessaries\nfor their neighbors, and gave seed to the Syrians, which thing turned greatly\nto his own advantage also, this charitable assistance being afforded most\nseasonably to their fruitful soil, so that every one had now a plentiful\nprovision of food. Upon the whole, when the harvest of the land was approaching,\nhe sent no fewer than fifty thousand men, whom he had sustained, into the\ncountry; by which means he both repaired the afflicted condition of his\nown kingdom with great generosity and diligence, and lightened the afflictions\nof his neighbors, who were under the same calamities; for there was nobody\nwho had been in want that was left destitute of a suitable assistance by\nhim; nay, further, there were neither any people, nor any cities, nor any\nprivate men, who were to make provision for the multitudes, and on that\naccount were in want of support, and had recourse to him, but received\nwhat they stood in need of, insomuch that it appeared, upon a computation,\nthat the number of cori of wheat, of ten attic medimni apiece, that were\ngiven to foreigners, amounted to ten thousand, and the number that was\ngiven in his own kingdom was about fourscore thousand. Now it happened\nthat this care of his, and this seasonable benefaction, had such influence\non the Jews, and was so cried up among other nations, as to wipe off that\nold hatred which his violation of some of their customs, during his reign,\nhad procured him among all the nation, and that this liberality of his\nassistance in this their greatest necessity was full satisfaction for all\nthat he had done of that nature, as it also procured him great fame among\nforeigners; and it looked as if these calamities that afflicted his land,\nto a degree plainly incredible, came in order to raise his glory, and to\nbe to his great advantage; for the greatness of his liberality in these\ndistresses, which he now demonstrated beyond all expectation, did so change\nthe disposition of the multitude towards him, that they were ready to suppose\nhe had been from the beginning not such a one as they had found him to\nbe by experience, but such a one as the care he had taken of them in supplying\ntheir necessities proved him now to be.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This Aelius Gallus seems to be no other than that Aelius Lagus whom Dio\nspeaks of as conducting an expedition that was about this time made into\nArabia Felix, according to Betarius, who is here cited by Spanheim.

These apartments were also of distinct magnitudes,\nand had particular names given them; for one apartment was called Caesar's,\nanother Agrippa's.

And while Simon was of a dignity too inferior to be\nallied to him, but still too considerable to be despised, he governed his\ninclinations after the most prudent manner, by augmenting the dignity of\nthe family, and making them more honorable; so he immediately deprived\nJesus, the son of Phabet, of the high priesthood, and conferred that dignity\non Simon, and so joined in affinity with him [by marrying his daughter]."}, "When this wedding was over, he built another citadel in that place\nwhere he had conquered file Jews when he was driven out of his government,\nand Antigonus enjoyed it.

But still he took care to\nhave external security for his government as a fortress against his subjects;\nfor the orations he made to the cities were very fine, and full of kindness;\nand he cultivated a seasonable good understanding with their governors,\nand bestowed presents on every one of them, inducing them thereby to be\nmore friendly to him, and using his magnificent disposition so as his kingdom\nmight be the better secured to him, and this till all his affairs were\nevery way more and more augmented.

He\nalso adorned it with most sumptuous palaces and large edifices for containing\nthe people; and what was the greatest and most laborious work of all, he\nadorned it with a haven, that was always free from the waves of the sea.\nIts largeness was not less than the Pyrmum [at Athens], and had towards\nthe city a double station for the ships. It was of excellent workmanship;\nand this was the more remarkable for its being built in a place that of\nitself was not suitable to such noble structures, but was to be brought\nto perfection by materials from other places, and at very great expenses.\nThis city is situate in Phoenicia, in the passage by sea to Egypt, between\nJoppa and Dora, which are lesser maritime cities, and not fit for havens,\non account of the impetuous south winds that beat upon them, which rolling\nthe sands that come from the sea against the shores, do not admit of ships\nlying in their station; but the merchants are generally there forced to\nride at their anchors in the sea itself. So Herod endeavored to rectify\nthis inconvenience, and laid out such a compass towards the land as might\nbe sufficient for a haven, wherein the great ships might lie in safety;\nand this he effected by letting down vast stones of above fifty feet in\nlength, not less than eighteen in breadth, and nine in depth, into twenty\nfathom deep; and as some were lesser, so were others bigger than those\ndimensions. This mole which he built by the sea-side was two hundred feet\nwide, the half of which was opposed to the current of the waves, so as\nto keep off those waves which were to break upon them, and so was called\nProcymatia, or the first breaker of the waves; but the other half had upon\nit a wall, with several towers, the largest of which was named Drusus,\nand was a work of very great excellence, and had its name from Drusus,\nthe son-in-law of Caesar, who died young. There were also a great number\nof arches where the mariners dwelt. There was also before them a quay,\n[or landing place,] which ran round the entire haven, and was a most agreeable\nwalk to such as had a mind to that exercise; but the entrance or mouth\nof the port was made on the north quarter, on which side was the stillest\nof the winds of all in this place: and the basis of the whole circuit on\nthe left hand, as you enter the port, supported a round turret, which was\nmade very strong, in order to resist the greatest waves; while on the right\nhand, as you enter, stood two vast stones, and those each of them larger\nthan the turret, which were over against them; these stood upright, and\nwere joined together. Now there were edifices all along the circular haven,\nmade of the politest stone, with a certain elevation, whereon was erected\na temple, that was seen a great way off by those that were sailing for\nthat haven, and had in it two statues, the one of Rome, the other of Caesar.\nThe city itself was called Cesarea, which was also itself built of fine\nmaterials, and was of a fine structure; nay, the very subterranean vaults\nand cellars had no less of architecture bestowed on them than had the buildings\nabove ground. Some of these vaults carried things at even distances to\nthe haven and to the sea; but one of them ran obliquely, and bound all\nthe rest together, that both the rain and the filth of the citizens were\ntogether carried off with ease, and the sea itself, upon the flux of the\ntide from without, came into the city, and washed it all clean. Herod also\nbuilt therein a theater of stone; and on the south quarter, behind the\nport, an amphitheater also, capable of holding a vast number of men, and\nconveniently situated for a prospect to the sea.

When these matters were laid\nbefore Caesar, he wrote back to Varro to destroy those nests of robbers,\nand to give the land to Herod, that so by his care the neighboring countries\nmight be no longer disturbed with these doings of the Trachonites; for\nit was not an easy firing to restrain them, since this way of robbery had\nbeen their usual practice, and they had no other way to get their living,\nbecause they had neither any city of their own, nor lands in their possession,\nbut only some receptacles and dens in the earth, and there they and their\ncattle lived in common together. However, they had made contrivances to\nget pools of water, and laid up corn in granaries for themselves, and were\nable to make great resistance, by issuing out on the sudden against any\nthat attacked them; for the entrances of their caves were narrow, in which\nbut one could come in at a time, and the places within incredibly large,\nand made very wide but the ground over their habitations was not very high,\nbut rather on a plain, while the rocks are altogether hard and difficult\nto be entered upon, unless any one gets into the plain road by the guidance\nof another, for these roads are not straight, but have several revolutions.\nBut when these men are hindered from their wicked preying upon their neighbors,\ntheir custom is to prey one upon another, insomuch that no sort of injustice\ncomes amiss to them.

Now Agrippa was [about this time] sent to succeed Caesar\nin the government of the countries beyond the Ionian Sea, upon whom Herod\nlighted when he was wintering about Mitylene, for he had been his particular\nfriend and companion, and then returned into Judea again. However, some\nof the Gadarens came to Agrippa, and accused Herod, whom he sent back bound\nto the king without giving them the hearing. But still the Arabians, who\nof old bare ill-will to Herod's government, were nettled, and at that time\nattempted to raise a sedition in his dominions, and, as they thought, upon\na more justifiable occasion; for Zenodorus, despairing already of success\nas to his own affairs, prevented [his enemies], by selling to those Arabians\na part of his principality, called Auranitis, for the value of fifty talents;\nbut as this was included in the donations of Caesar, they contested the\npoint with Herod, as unjustly deprived of what they had bought. Sometimes\nthey did this by making incursions upon him, and sometimes by attempting\nforce against him, and sometimes by going to law with him. Moreover, they\npersuaded the poorer soldiers to help them, and were troublesome to him,\nout of a constant hope that they should reduce the people to raise a sedition;\nin which designs those that are in the most miserable circumstances of\nlife are still the most earnest; and although Herod had been a great while\napprized of these attempts, yet did not he indulge any severity to them,\nbut by rational methods aimed to mitigate things, as not willing to give\nany handle for tumults.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "A tetrarchy properly and originally denoted the fourth part of an entire\nkingdom or country, and a tetrarch one that was ruler of such a fourth\npart, which always implies somewhat less extent of dominion and power than\nbelong to a kingdom and to a king."}, "#text": "Now when Herod had already reigned seventeen years, Caesar came into\nSyria; at which time the greatest part of the inhabitants of Gadara clamored\nagainst Herod, as one that was heavy in his injunctions, and tyrannical.\nThese reproaches they mainly ventured upon by the encouragement of Zenodorus,\nwho took his oath that he would never leave Herod till he had procured\nthat they should be severed from Herod's kingdom, and joined to Caesar's\nprovince. The Gadarens were induced hereby, and made no small cry against\nhim, and that the more boldly, because those that had been delivered up\nby Agrippa were not punished by Herod, who let them go, and did them no\nharm; for indeed he was the principal man in the world who appeared almost\ninexorable in punishing crimes in his own family, but very generous in\nremitting the offenses that were committed elsewhere. And while they accused\nHerod of injuries, and plunderings, and subversions of temples, he stood\nunconcerned, and was ready to make his defense. However, Caesar gave him\nhis right hand, and remitted nothing of his kindness to him, upon this\ndisturbance by the multitude; and indeed these things were alleged the\nfirst day, but the hearing proceeded no further; for as the Gadarens saw\nthe inclination of Caesar and of his assessors, and expected, as they had\nreason to do, that they should be delivered up to the king, some of them,\nout of a dread of the torments they might undergo, cut their own throats\nin the night time, and some of them threw themselves down precipices, and\nothers of them cast themselves into the river, and destroyed themselves\nof their own accord; which accidents seemed a sufficient condemnation of\nthe rashness and crimes they had been guilty of; whereupon Caesar made\nno longer delay, but cleared Herod from the crimes he was accused of. Another\nhappy accident there was, which was a further great advantage to Herod\nat this time; for Zenodorus's belly burst, and a great quantity of blood\nissued from him in his sickness, and he thereby departed this life at Antioch\nin Syria; so Caesar bestowed his country, which was no small one, upon\nHerod; it lay between Trachon and Galilee, and contained Ulatha, and Paneas,\nand the country round about. He also made him one of the procurators of\nSyria, and commanded that they should do every thing with his approbation;\nand, in short, he arrived at that pitch of felicity, that whereas there\nwere but two men that governed the vast Roman empire, first Caesar, and\nthen Agrippa, who was his principal favorite, Caesar preferred no one to\nHerod besides Agrippa, and Agrippa made no one his greater friend than\nHerod besides Caesar. And when he had acquired such freedom, he begged\nof Caesar a tetrarchy \nfor his brother Pheroras, while he did himself bestow upon him a revenue\nof a hundred talents out of his own kingdom, that in case he came to any\nharm himself, his brother might be in safety, and that his sons might not\nhave dominion over him. So when he had conducted Caesar to the sea, and\nwas returned home, he built him a most beautiful temple, of the whitest\nstone, in Zenodorus's country, near the place called Panlure. This is a\nvery fine cave in a mountain, under which there is a great cavity in the\nearth, and the cavern is abrupt, and prodigiously deep, and frill of a\nstill water; over it hangs a vast mountain; and under the caverns arise\nthe springs of the river Jordan.

And do thou remember\nthe blows that Manahem hath given thee, as being a signal of the change\nof thy fortune. And truly this will be the best reasoning for thee, that\nthou love justice [towards men], and piety towards God, and clemency towards\nthy citizens; yet do I know how thy whole conduct will be, that thou wilt\nnot be such a one, for thou wilt excel all men in happiness, and obtain\nan everlasting reputation, but wilt forget piety and righteousness; and\nthese crimes will not be concealed from God, at the conclusion of thy life,\nwhen thou wilt find that he will be mindful of them, and punish time for\nthem.\" Now at that time Herod did not at all attend to what Manahem\nsaid, as having no hopes of such advancement; but a little afterward, when\nhe was so fortunate as to be advanced to the dignity of king, and was in\nthe height of his dominion, he sent for Manahem, and asked him how long\nhe should reign. Manahem did not tell him the full length of his reign;\nwherefore, upon that silence of his, he asked him further, whether he should\nreign ten years or not? He replied, \"Yes, twenty, nay, thirty years;\"\nbut did not assign the just determinate limit of his reign. Herod was satisfied\nwith these replies, and gave Manahem his hand, and dismissed him; and from\nthat time he continued to honor all the Essens.

Our fathers, indeed,\nwhen they were returned from Babylon, built this temple to God Almighty,\nyet does it want sixty cubits of its largeness in altitude; for so much\ndid that first temple which Solomon built exceed this temple; nor let any\none condemn our fathers for their negligence or want of piety herein, for\nit was not their fault that the temple was no higher; for they were Cyrus,\nand Darius the son of Hystaspes, who determined the measures for its rebuilding;\nand it hath been by reason of the subjection of those fathers of ours to\nthem and to their posterity, and after them to the Macedonians, that they\nhad not the opportunity to follow the original model of this pious edifice,\nnor could raise it to its ancient altitude; but since I am now, by God's\nwill, your governor, and I have had peace a long time, and have gained\ngreat riches and large revenues, and, what is the principal filing of all,\nI am at amity with and well regarded by the Romans, who, if I may so say,\nare the rulers of the whole world, I will do my endeavor to correct that\nimperfection, which hath arisen from the necessity of our affairs, and\nthe slavery we have been under formerly, and to make a thankful return,\nafter the most pious manner, to God, for what blessings I have received\nfrom him, by giving me this kingdom, and that by rendering his temple as\ncomplete as I am able.\""}, "And this was the speech which Herod made to them; but still this\nspeech aftrighted many of the people, as being unexpected by them; and\nbecause it seemed incredible, it did not encourage them, but put a damp\nupon them, for they were afraid that he would pull down the whole edifice,\nand not be able to bring his intentions to perfection for its rebuilding;\nand this danger appeared to them to be very great, and the vastness of\nthe undertaking to be such as could hardly be accomplished. But while they\nwere in this disposition, the king encouraged them, and told them he would\nnot pull down their temple till all things were gotten ready for building\nit up entirely again. And as he promised them this beforehand, so he did\nnot break his word with them, but got ready a thousand waggons, that were\nto bring stones for the building, and chose out ten thousand of the most\nskillful workmen, and bought a thousand sacerdotal garments for as many\nof the priests, and had some of them taught the arts of stone-cutters,\nand others of carpenters, and then began to build; but this not till every\nthing was well prepared for the work.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Some of our modern students in architecture have made a strange blunder\nhere, when they imagine that Josephus affirms the entire foundations of\nthe temple or holy house sunk down into the rocky mountain on which it\nstood no less than twenty cubits, whereas he is clear that they were the\nfoundations of the additional twenty cubits only above the hundred (made\nperhaps weak on purpose, and only for show and grandeur) that sunk or fell\ndown, as Dr. Hudson rightly understands him; nor is the thing itself possible\nin the other sense. Agrippa's preparation for building the inner parts\nof the temple twenty cubits higher (History of the War, B. V. ch. 1. sect.\n5) must in all probability refer to this matter, since Josephus says here,\nthat this which had fallen down was designed to be raised up again under\nNero, under whom Agrippa made that preparation. But what Josephus says\npresently, that Solomon was the first king of the Jews, appears by the\nparallel place, Antiq. B. XX. ch. 9. sect. 7, and other places, to be meant\nonly the first of David's posterity, and the first builder of the temple."}, "#text": "So Herod took away the old foundations, and laid others, and erected\nthe temple upon them, being in length a hundred cubits, and in height twenty\nadditional cubits, which [twenty], upon the sinking of their foundations\n\nfell down; and this part it was that we resolved to raise again in the\ndays of Nero. Now the temple was built of stones that were white and strong,\nand each of their length was twenty-five cubits, their height was eight,\nand their breadth about twelve; and the whole structure, as also the structure\nof the royal cloister, was on each side much lower, but the middle was\nmuch higher, till they were visible to those that dwelt in the country\nfor a great many furlongs, but chiefly to such as lived over against them,\nand those that approached to them. The temple had doors also at the entrance,\nand lintels over them, of the same height with the temple itself. They\nwere adorned with embroidered veils, with their flowers of purple, and\npillars interwoven; and over these, but under the crown-work, was spread\nout a golden vine, with its branches hanging down from a great height,\nthe largeness and fine workmanship of which was a surprising sight to the\nspectators, to see what vast materials there were, and with what great\nskill the workmanship was done. He also encompassed the entire temple with\nvery large cloisters, contriving them to be in a due proportion thereto;\nand he laid out larger sums of money upon them than had been done before\nhim, till it seemed that no one else had so greatly adorned the temple\nas he had done. There was a large wall to both the cloisters, which wall\nwas itself the most prodigious work that was ever heard of by man. The\nhill was a rocky ascent, that declined by degrees towards the east parts\nof the city, till it came to an elevated level. This hill it was which\nSolomon, who was the first of our kings, by Divine revelation, encompassed\nwith a wall; it was of excellent workmanship upwards, and round the top\nof it. He also built a wall below, beginning at the bottom, which was encompassed\nby a deep valley; and at the south side he laid rocks together, and bound\nthem one to another with lead, and included some of the inner parts, till\nit proceeded to a great height, and till both the largeness of the square\nedifice and its altitude were immense, and till the vastness of the stones\nin the front were plainly visible on the outside, yet so that the inward\nparts were fastened together with iron, and preserved the joints immovable\nfor all future times. When this work [for the foundation] was done in this\nmanner, and joined together as part of the hill itself to the very top\nof it, he wrought it all into one outward surface, and filled up the hollow\nplaces which were about the wall, and made it a level on the external upper\nsurface, and a smooth level also. This hill was walled all round, and in\ncompass four furlongs, [the distance of] each angle containing in length\na furlong: but within this wall, and on the very top of all, there ran\nanother wall of stone also, having, on the east quarter, a double cloister,\nof the same length with the wall; in the midst of which was the temple\nitself. This cloister looked to the gates of the temple; and it had been\nadorned by many kings in former times; and round about the entire temple\nwere fixed the spoils taken from barbarous nations; all these had been\ndedicated to the temple by Herod, with the addition of those he had taken\nfrom the Arabians."}, "Now on the north side [of the temple] was built a citadel, whose\nwalls were square, and strong, and of extraordinary firmness. This citadel\nwas built by the kings of the Asamonean race, who were also high priests\nbefore Herod, and they called it the Tower, in which were reposited the\nvestments of the high priest, which the high priest only put on at the\ntime when he was to offer sacrifice. These vestments king Herod kept in\nthat place; and after his death they were under the power of the Romans,\nuntil the time of Tiberius Caesar; under whose reign Vitellius, the president\nof Syria, when he once came to Jerusalem, and had been most magnificently\nreceived by the multitude, he had a mind to make them some requital for\nthe kindness they had shewn him; so, upon their petition to have those\nholy vestments in their own power, he wrote about them to Tiberius Caesar,\nwho granted his request: and this their power over the sacerdotal vestments\ncontinued with the Jews till the death of king Agrippa; but after that,\nCassius Longinus, who was president of Syria, and Cuspius Fadus, who was\nprocurator of Judea, enjoined the Jews to reposit those vestments in the\ntower of Antonia, for that they ought to have them in their power, as they\nformerly had. However, the Jews sent ambassadors to Claudius Caesar, to\nintercede with him for them; upon whose coming, king Agrippa, junior, being\nthen at Rome, asked for and obtained the power over them from the emperor,\nwho gave command to Vitellius, who was then commander in Syria, to give\nit them accordingly. Before that time they were kept under the seal of\nthe high priest, and of the treasurers of the temple; which treasurers,\nthe day before a festival, went up to the Roman captain of the temple guards,\nand viewed their own seal, and received the vestments; and again, when\nthe festival was over, they brought it to the same place, and showed the\ncaptain of the temple guards their seal, which corresponded with his seal,\nand reposited them there. And that these things were so, the afflictions\nthat happened to us afterwards [about them] are sufficient evidence. But\nfor the tower itself, when Herod the king of the Jews had fortified it\nmore firmly than before, in order to secure and guard the temple, he gratified\nAntonius, who was his friend, and the Roman ruler, and then gave it the\nname of the Tower of Antonia.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "\"Into none Of these three did king Herod enter,\" i.e. 1.

This cloister had pillars\nthat stood in four rows one over against the other all along, for the fourth\nrow was interwoven into the wall, which [also was built of stone]; and\nthe thickness of each pillar was such, that three men might, with their\narms extended, fathom it round, and join their hands again, while its length\nwas twenty-seven feet, with a double spiral at its basis; and the number\nof all the pillars [in that court] was a hundred and sixty-two. Their chapiters\nwere made with sculptures after the Corinthian order, and caused an amazement\n[to the spectators], by reason of the grandeur of the whole. These four\nrows of pillars included three intervals for walking in the middle of this\ncloister; two of which walks were made parallel to each other, and were\ncontrived after the same manner; the breadth of each of them was thirty\nfeet, the length was a furlong, and the height fifty feet; but the breadth\nof the middle part of the cloister was one and a half of the other, and\nthe height was double, for it was much higher than those on each side;\nbut the roofs were adorned with deep sculptures in wood, representing many\nsorts of figures. The middle was much higher than the rest, and the wall\nof the front was adorned with beams, resting upon pillars, that were interwoven\ninto it, and that front was all of polished stone, insomuch that its fineness,\nto such as had not seen it, was incredible, and to such as had seen it,\nwas greatly amazing. Thus was the first enclosure. In the midst of which,\nand not far from it, was the second, to be gone up to by a few steps: this\nwas encompassed by a stone wall for a partition, with an inscription, which\nforbade any foreigner to go in under pain of death. Now this inner enclosure\nhad on its southern and northern quarters three gates [equally] distant\none from another; but on the east quarter, towards the sun-rising, there\nwas one large gate, through which such as were pure came in, together with\ntheir wives; but the temple further inward in that gate was not allowed\nto the women; but still more inward was there a third [court of the] temple,\nwhereinto it was not lawful for any but the priests alone to enter. The\ntemple itself was within this; and before that temple was the altar, upon\nwhich we offer our sacrifices and burnt-offerings to God. Into none of\nthese three did king Herod enter, \nfor he was forbidden, because he was not a priest. However, he took care\nof the cloisters and the outer enclosures, and these he built in eight\nyears."}, "But the temple itself was built by the priests in a year and six\nmonths; upon which all the people were full of joy; and presently they\nreturned thanks, in the first place, to God; and in the next place, for\nthe alacrity the king had showed. They feasted and celebrated this rebuilding\nof the temple: and for the king, he sacrificed three hundred oxen to God,\nas did the rest every one according to his ability; the number of which\nsacrifices is not possible to set down, for it cannot be that we should\ntruly relate it; for at the same time with this celebration for the work\nabout the temple fell also the day of the king's inauguration, which he\nkept of an old custom as a festival, and it now coincided with the other,\nwhich coincidence of them both made the festival most illustrious.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "date": {"@value": "1666", "#text": "1666"}, "#text": "This tradition which Josephus here mentions, as delivered down from fathers\nto their children, of this particular remarkable circumstance relating\nto the building of Herod's temple, is a demonstration that such its building\nwas a known thing in Judea at this time.

Now this penalty, thus brought into practice, was like Herod's\nother actions, and became a part of his accusation, and an occasion of\nthe hatred he lay under.", "Now at this time it was that he sailed to Italy, as very desirous\nto meet with Caesar, and to see his sons who lived at Rome; and Caesar\nwas not only very obliging to him in other respects, but delivered him\nhis sons again, that he might take them home with him, as having already\ncompleted themselves in the sciences; but as soon as the young men were\ncome from Italy, the multitude were very desirous to see them, and they\nbecame conspicuous among them all, as adorned with great blessings of fortune,\nand having the countenances of persons of royal dignity. So they soon appeared\nto be the objects of envy to Salome, the king's sister, and to such as\nhad raised calumnies against Mariamne; for they were suspicious, that when\nthese came to the government, they should be punished for the wickedness\nthey had been guilty of against their mother; so they made this very fear\nof theirs a motive to raise calumnies against them also. They gave it out\nthat they were not pleased with their father's company, because he had\nput their mother to death, as if it were not agreeable to piety to appear\nto converse with their mother's murderer. Now, by carrying these stories;\nthat had indeed a true foundation [in the fact], but were only built on\nprobabilities as to the present accusation, they were able to do them mischief,\nand to make Herod take away that kindness from his sons which he had before\nborne to them; for they did not say these things to him openly, but scattered\nabroad such words, among the rest of the multitude; from which words, when\ncarried to Herod, he was induced [at last] to hate them, and which natural\naffection itself, even in length of time, was not able to overcome; yet\nwas the king at that time in a condition to prefer the natural affection\nof a father before all the suspicions and calumnies his sons lay under.\nSo he respected them as he ought to do, and married them to wives, now\nthey were of an age suitable thereto. To Aristobulus he gave for a wife\nBernice, Salome's daughter; and to Alexander, Glaphyra, the daughter of\nArchelaus, king of Cappadocia.", "WHEN Herod had despatched these affairs, and he understood that Marcus\nAgrippa had sailed again out of Italy into Asia, he made haste to him,\nand besought him to come to him into his kingdom, and to partake of what\nhe might justly expect from one that had been his guest, and was his friend.\nThis request he greatly pressed, and to it Agrippa agreed, and came into\nJudea; whereupon Herod omitted nothing that might please him. He entertained\nhim in his new-built cities, and showed him the edifices he had built,\nand provided all sorts of the best and most costly dainties for him and\nhis friends, and that at Sebaste and Cesarea, about that port that he had\nbuilt, and at the fortresses which he had erected at great expenses, Alexandrium,\nand Herodium, and Hyrcania. He also conducted him to the city Jerusalem,\nwhere all the people met him in their festival garments, and received him\nwith acclamations. Agrippa also offered a hecatomb of sacrifices to God;\nand feasted the people, without omitting any of the greatest dainties that\ncould be gotten. He also took so much pleasure there, that he abode many\ndays with them, and would willingly have staid longer, but that the season\nof the year made him make haste away; for as winter was coming on, he thought\nit not safe to go to sea later, and yet he was of necessity to return again\nto Ionia.", "So Agrippa went away, when Herod had bestowed on him, and on the\nprincipal of those that were with him, many presents; but king Herod, when\nhe had passed the winter in his own dominions, made haste to get to him\nagain in the spring, when he knew he designed to go to a campaign at the\nBosptiorus. So when he had sailed by Rhodes and by Cos, he touched at Lesbos,\nas thinking he should have overtaken Agrippa there; but he was taken short\nhere by a north wind, which hindered his ship from going to the shore;\nso he continued many days at Chius, and there he kindly treated a great\nmany that came to him, and obliged them by giving them royal gifts. And\nwhen he saw that the portico of the city was fallen down, which as it was\noverthrown in the Mithridatic war, and was very large and fine building,\nso was it not so easy to rebuild that as it was the rest, yet did he furnish\na sum not only large enough for that purpose, but what was more than sufficient\nto finish the building; and ordered them not to overlook that portico,\nbut to rebuild it quickly, that so the city might recover its proper ornaments.\nAnd when the high winds were laid, he sailed to Mytilene, and thence to\nByzantium; and when he heard that Agrippa was sailed beyond the Cyanean\nrocks, he made all the haste possible to overtake him, and came up with\nhim about Sinope, in Pontus. He was seen sailing by the ship-men most unexpectedly,\nbut appeared to their great joy; and many friendly salutations there were\nbetween them, insomuch that Agrippa thought he had received the greatest\nmarks of the king's kindness and humanity towards him possible, since the\nking had come so long a voyage, and at a very proper season, for his assistance,\nand had left the government of his own dominions, and thought it more worth\nhis while to come to him. Accordingly, Herod was all in all to Agrippa,\nin the management of the war, and a great assistant in civil affairs, and\nin giving him counsel as to particular matters. He was also a pleasant\ncompanion for him when he relaxed himself, and a joint partaker with him\nin all things; ill troubles because of his kindness, and in prosperity\nbecause of the respect Agrippa had for him. Now as soon as those affairs\nof Pontus were finished, for whose sake Agrippa was sent thither, they\ndid not think fit to return by sea, but passed through Paphlagonia and\nCappadocia; they then traveled thence over great Phrygia, and came to Ephesus,\nand then they sailed from Ephesus to Samos. And indeed the king bestowed\na great many benefits on every city that he came to, according as they\nstood in need of them; for as for those that wanted either money or kind\ntreatment, he was not wanting to them; but he supplied the former himself\nout of his own expenses: he also became an intercessor with Agrippa for\nall such as sought after his favor, and he brought things so about, that\nthe petitioners failed in none of their suits to him, Agrippa being himself\nof a good disposition, and of great generosity, and ready to grant all\nsuch requests as might be advantageous to the petitioners, provided they\nwere not to the detriment of others. The inclination of the king was of\ngreat weight also, and still excited Agrippa, who was himself ready to\ndo good; for he made a reconciliation between the people of Ilium, at whom\nhe was angry, and paid what money the people of Chius owed Caesar's procurators,\nand discharged them of their tributes; and helped all others, according\nas their several necessities required.", {"milestone": [{"@n": "4", "@unit": "Whiston section"}, {"@n": "31", "@unit": "section"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "We may here observe the ancient practice of the Jews, of dedicating the\nsabbath day, not to idleness, but to the learning their sacred rites and\nreligious customs, and to the meditation on the law of Moses; the like\nto which we meet with elsewhere in Josephus also against Apion, B. I. sect.\n22."}, "#text": "But now, when Agrippa and Herod were in Ionia, a great multitude\nof Jews, who dwelt in their cities, came to them, and laying hold of the\nopportunity and the liberty now given them, laid before them the injuries\nwhich they suffered, while they were not permitted to use their own laws,\nbut were compelled to prosecute their law-suits, by the ill usage of the\njudges, upon their holy days, and were deprived of the money they used\nto lay up at Jerusalem, and were forced into the army, and upon such other\noffices as obliged them to spend their sacred money; from which burdens\nthey always used to be freed by the Romans, who had still permitted them\nto live according to their own laws. When this clamor was made, the king\ndesired of Agrippa that he would hear their cause, and assigned Nicolaus,\none of his friends, to plead for those their privileges. Accordingly, when\nAgrippa had called the principal of the Romans, and such of the kings and\nrulers as were there, to be his assessors, Nicolaus stood up, and pleaded\nfor the Jews, as follows: \"It is of necessity incumbent on such as\nare in distress to have recourse to those that have it in their power to\nfree them from those injuries they lie under; and for those that now are\ncomplainants, they approach you with great assurance; for as they have\nformerly often obtained your favor, so far as they have even wished to\nhave it, they now only entreat that you, who have been the donors, will\ntake care that those favors you have already granted them may not be taken\naway from them. We have received these favors from you, who alone have\npower to grant them, but have them taken from us by such as are no greater\nthan ourselves, and by such as we know are as much subjects as we are;\nand certainly, if we have been vouchsafed great favors, it is to our commendation\nwho have obtained them, as having been found deserving of such great favors;\nand if those favors be but small ones, it would be barbarous for the donors\nnot to confirm them to us. And for those that are the hinderance of the\nJews, and use them reproachfully, it is evident that they affront both\nthe receivers, while they will not allow those to be worthy men to whom\ntheir excellent rulers themselves have borne their testimony, and the donors,\nwhile they desire those favors already granted may be abrogated. Now if\nany one should ask these Gentiles themselves, which of the two things they\nwould choose to part with, their lives, or the customs of their forefathers,\ntheir solemnities, their sacrifices, their festivals, which they celebrated\nin honor of those they suppose to be gods? I know very well that they would\nchoose to suffer any thing whatsoever rather than a dissolution of any\nof the customs of their forefathers; for a great many of them have rather\nchosen to go to war on that account, as very solicitous not to transgress\nin those matters. And indeed we take an estimate of that happiness which\nall mankind do now enjoy by your means from this very thing, that we are\nallowed every one to worship as our own institutions require, and yet to\nlive [in peace]; and although they would not be thus treated themselves,\nyet do they endeavor to compel others to comply with them, as if it were\nnot as great an instance of impiety profanely to dissolve the religious\nsolemnities of any others, as to be negligent in the observation of their\nown towards their gods. And let us now consider the one of these practices.\nIs there any people, or city, or community of men, to whom your government\nand the Roman power does not appear to be the greatest blessing '. Is there\nany one that can desire to make void the favors they have granted? No one\nis certainly so mad; for there are no men but such as have been partakers\nof their favors, both public and private; and indeed those that take away\nwhat you have granted, can have no assurance but every one of their own\ngrants made them by you may be taken from them also; which grants of yours\ncan yet never be sufficiently valued; for if they consider the old governments\nunder kings, together with your present government, besides the great number\nof benefits which this government hath bestowed on them, in order to their\nhappiness, this is instead of all the rest, that they appear to be no longer\nin a state of slavery, but of freedom. Now the privileges we desire, even\nwhen we are in the best circumstances, are not such as deserve to be envied,\nfor we are indeed in a prosperous state by your means, but this is only\nin common with others; and it is no more than this which we desire, to\npreserve our religion without any prohibition; which as it appears not\nin itself a privilege to be envied us, so it is for the advantage of those\nthat grant it to us; for if the Divinity delights in being honored, it\nmust delight in those that permit them to be honored. And there are none\nof our customs which are inhuman, but all tending to piety, and devoted\nto the preservation of justice; nor do we conceal those injunctions of\nours by which we govern our lives, they being memorials of piety, and of\na friendly conversation among men. And the seventh day we set apart from\nlabor; it is dedicated to the learning of our customs and laws, \nwe thinking it proper to reflect on them, as well as on any [good] thing\nelse, in order to our avoiding of sin. If any one therefore examine into\nour observances, he will find they are good in themselves, and that they\nare ancient also, though some think otherwise, insomuch that those who\nhave received them cannot easily be brought to depart from them, out of\nthat honor they pay to the length of time they have religiously enjoyed\nthem and observed them. Now our adversaries take these our privileges away\nin the way of injustice; they violently seize upon that money of ours which\nis owed to God, and called sacred money, and this openly, after a sacrilegious\nmanner; and they impose tributes upon us, and bring us before tribunals\non holy days, and then require other like debts of us, not because the\ncontracts require it, and for their own advantage, but because they would\nput an affront on our religion, of which they are conscious as well as\nwe, and have indulged themselves in an unjust, and to them involuntary,\nhatred; for your government over all is one, tending to the establishing\nof benevolence, and abolishing of ill-will among such as are disposed to\nit. This is therefore what we implore from thee, most excellent Agrippa,\nthat we may not be ill-treated; that we may not be abused; that we may\nnot be hindered from making use of our own customs, nor be despoiled of\nour goods, nor be forced by these men to do what we ourselves force nobody\nto do; for these privileges of ours are not only according to justice,\nbut have formerly been granted us by you. And we are able to read to you\nmany decrees of the senate, and the tables that contain them, which are\nstill extant in the capitol, concerning these things, which it is evident\nwere granted after you had experience of our fidelity towards you, which\nought to be valued, though no such fidelity had been; for you have hitherto\npreserved what people were in possession of, not to us only, but almost\nto all men, and have added greater advantages than they could have hoped\nfor, and thereby your government is become a great advantage to them. And\nif any one were able to enumerate the prosperity you have conferred on\nevery nation, which they possess by your means, he could never put an end\nto his discourse; but that we may demonstrate that we are not unworthy\nof all those advantages we have obtained, it will be sufficient for us,\nto say nothing of other things, but to speak freely of this king who now\ngoverns us, and is now one of thy assessors; and indeed in what instance\nof good-will, as to your house, hath he been deficient? What mark of fidelity\nto it hath he omitted? What token of honor hath he not devised? What occasion\nfor his assistance of you hath he not regarded at the very first? What\nhindereth; therefore, but that your kindnesses may be as numerous as his\nso great benefits to you have been? It may also perhaps be fit not here\nto pass over in silence the valor of his father Antipater, who, when Caesar\nmade an expedition into Egypt, assisted him with two thousand armed men,\nand proved inferior to none, neither in the battles on land, nor in the\nmanagement of the navy; and what need I say any thing of how great weight\nthose soldiers were at that juncture? or how many and how great presents\nthey were vouchsafed by Caesar? And truly I ought before now to have mentioned\nthe epistles which Caesar wrote to the senate; and how Antipater had honors,\nand the freedom of the city of Rome, bestowed upon him; for these are demonstrations\nboth that we have received these favors by our own deserts, and do on that\naccount petition thee for thy confirmation of them, from whom we had reason\nto hope for them, though they had not been given us before, both out of\nregard to our king's disposition towards you, and your disposition towards\nhim. And further, we have been informed by those Jews that were there with\nwhat kindness thou camest into our country, and how thou offeredst the\nmost perfect sacrifices to God, and honoredst him with remarkable vows,\nand how thou gavest the people a feast, and acceptedst of their own hospitable\npresents to thee. We ought to esteem all these kind entertainments made\nboth by our nation and to our city, to a man who is the ruler and manager\nof so much of the public affairs, as indications of that friendship which\nthou hast returned to the Jewish nation, and which hath been procured them\nby the family of Herod. So we put thee in mind of these things in the presence\nof the king, now sitting by thee, and make our request for no more but\nthis, that what you have given us yourselves you will not see taken away\nby others from us.\""}, "When Nicolaus had made this speech, there was no opposition made\nto it by the Greeks, for this was not an inquiry made, as in a court of\njustice, but an intercession to prevent violence to be offered to the Jews\nany longer; nor did the Greeks make any defense of themselves, or deny\nwhat it was supposed they had done. Their pretense was no more than this,\nthat while the Jews inhabited in their country, they were entirely unjust\nto them [in not joining in their worship] but they demonstrated their generosity\nin this, that though they worshipped according to their institutions, they\ndid nothing that ought to grieve them. So when Agrippa perceived that they\nhad been oppressed by violence, he made this answer: That, on account of\nHerod's good-will and friendship, he was ready to grant the Jews whatsoever\nthey should ask him, and that their requests seemed to him in themselves\njust; and that if they requested any thing further, he should not scruple\nto grant it them, provided they were no way to the detriment of the Roman\ngovernment; but that while their request was no more than this, that what\nprivileges they had already given them might not be abrogated, he confirmed\nthis to them, that they might continue in the observation of their own\ncustoms, without any one offering them the least injury. And when he had\nsaid thus, he dissolved the assembly; upon which Herod stood up and saluted\nhim, and gave him thanks for the kind disposition he showed to them. Agrippa\nalso took this in a very obliging manner, and saluted him again, and embraced\nhim in his arms; after which he went away from Lesbos; but the king determined\nto sail from Samos to his own country; and when he had taken his leave\nof Agrippa, he pursued his voyage, and landed at Cesarea in a few days'\ntime, as having favorable winds; from whence he went to Jerusalem, and\nthere gathered all the people together to an assembly, not a few being\nthere out of the country also. So he came to them, and gave them a particular\naccount of all his journey, and of the affairs of all the Jews in Asia,\nhow by his means they would live without injurious treatment for the time\nto come. He also told them of the entire good fortune he had met with and\nhow he had administered the government, and had not neglected any thing\nwhich was for their advantage; and as he was very joyful, he now remitted\nto them the fourth part of their taxes for the last year. Accordingly,\nthey were so pleased with his favor and speech to them, that they went\ntheir ways with great gladness, and wished the king all manner of happiness.", "BUT now the affairs in Herod's family were in more and more disorder,\nand became more severe upon him, by the hatred of Salome to the young men\n[Alexander and Aristobulus], which descended as it were by inheritance\n[from their mother Mariamne]; and as she had fully succeeded against their\nmother, so she proceeded to that degree of madness and insolence, as to\nendeavor that none of her posterity might be left alive, who might have\nit in their power to revenge her death. The young men had also somewhat\nof a bold and uneasy disposition towards their father occasioned by the\nremembrance of what their mother had unjustly suffered, and by their own\naffectation of dominion. The old grudge was also renewed; and they east\nreproaches on Salome and Pheroras, who requited the young men with malicious\ndesigns, and actually laid treacherous snares for them. Now as for this\nhatred, it was equal on both sides, but the manner of exerting that hatred\nwas different; for as for the young men, they were rash, reproaching and\naffronting the others openly, and were inexperienced enough to think it\nthe most generous to declare their minds in that undaunted manner; but\nthe others did not take that method, but made use of calumnies after a\nsubtle and a spiteful manner, still provoking the young men, and imagining\nthat their boldness might in time turn to the offering violence to their\nfather; for inasmuch as they were not ashamed of the pretended crimes of\ntheir mother, nor thought she suffered justly, these supposed that might\nat length exceed all bounds, and induce them to think they ought to be\navenged on their father, though it were by despatching him with their own\nhands. At length it came to this, that the whole city was full of their\ndiscourses, and, as is usual in such contests, the unskilfulness of the\nyoung men was pitied; but the contrivance of Salome was too hard for them,\nand what imputations she laid upon them came to be believed, by means of\ntheir own conduct; for they who were so deeply affected with the death\nof their mother, that while they said both she and themselves were in a\nmiserable case, they vehemently complained of her pitiable end, which indeed\nwas truly such, and said that they were themselves in a pitiable case also,\nbecause they were forced to live with those that had been her murderers,\nand to be partakers with them.", "These disorders increased greatly, and the king's absence abroad\nhad afforded a fit opportunity for that increase; but as soon as Herod\nwas returned, and had made the forementioned speech to the multitude, Pheroras\nand Salome let fill words immediately as if he were in great danger, and\nas if the young men openly threatened that they would not spare him any\nlonger, but revenge their mother's death upon him. They also added another\ncircumstance, that their hopes were fixed on Archclaus, the king of Cappadocia,\nthat they should be able by his means to come to Caesar, and accuse their\nfather. Upon hearing such things, Herod was immediately disturbed; and\nindeed was the more astonished, because the same things were related to\nhim by some others also. He then called to mind his former calamity, and\nconsidered that the disorders in his family had hindered him from enjoying\nany comfort from those that were dearest to him or from his wife whom he\nloved so well; and suspecting that his future troubles would soon be heavier\nand greater than those that were past, he was in great confusion of mind;\nfor Divine Providence had in reality conferred upon him a great many outward\nadvantages for his happiness, even beyond his hopes; but the troubles he\nhad at home were such as he never expected to have met with, and rendered\nhim unfortunate; nay, both sorts came upon him to such a degree as no one\ncould imagine, and made it a doubtful question, whether, upon the comparison\nof both, he ought to have exchanged so great a success of outward good\nthings for so great misfortunes at home, or whether he ought not to have\nchosen to avoid the calamities relating to his family, though he had, for\na compensation, never been possessed of the admired grandeur of a kingdom.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This interval of ten years for the duration of Marcus Agrippa's government\nin Asia seems to be true, and agreeable to the Roman history.

So he introduced Antipater as their antagonist, and imagined\nthat he made a good provision for discouraging their pride, and that after\nthis was done to the young men, there might be a proper season for expecting\nthese to be of a better disposition; but the event proved otherwise than\nhe intended, for the young men thought he did them a very great injury;\nand as Antipater was a shrewd man, when he had once obtained this degree\nof freedom, and began to expect greater things than he had before hoped\nfor, he had but one single design in his head, and that was to distress\nhis brethren, and not at all to yield to them the pre-eminence, but to\nkeep close to his father, who was already alienated from them by the calumnies\nhe had heard about them, and ready to be wrought upon in any way his zeal\nagainst them should advise him to pursue, that he might be continually\nmore and more severe against them. Accordingly, all the reports that were\nspread abroad came from him, while he avoided himself the suspicion as\nif those discoveries proceeded from him; but he rather chose to make use\nof those persons for his assistants that were unsuspected, and such as\nmight be believed to speak truth by reason of the good-will they bore to\nthe king; and indeed there were already not a few who cultivated a friendship\nwith Antipater, in hopes of gaining somewhat by him, and these were the\nmen who most of all persuaded Herod, because they appeared to speak thus\nout of their good-will to him: and with these joint accusations, which\nfrom various foundations supported one another's veracity, the young men\nthemselves afforded further occasions to Antipater also; for they were\nobserved to shed tears often, on account of the injury that was offered\nthem, and had their mother in their mouths; and among their friends they\nventured to reproach their father, as not acting justly by them; all which\nthings were with an evil intention reserved in memory by Antipater against\na proper opportunity; and when they were told to Herod, with aggravations,\nincreased the disorder so much, that it brought a great tumult into the\nfamily; for while the king was very angry at imputations that were laid\nupon the sons of Mariamne, and was desirous to humble them, he still increased\nthe honor that he had bestowed on Antipater, and was at last so overcome\nby his persuasions, that he brought his mother to court also. He also wrote\nfrequently to Caesar in favor of him, and more earnestly recommended him\nto his care particularly. And when Agrippa was returning to Rome, after\nhe had finished his ten years' government in Asia. \nHerod sailed from Judea; and when he met with him, he had none with him\nbut Antipater, whom he delivered to Agrippa, that he might take him along\nwith him, together with many presents, that so he might become Caesar's\nfriend, insomuch that things already looked as if he had all his father's\nfavor, and that the young men were already entirely rejected from any hopes\nof the kingdom."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Although Herod met Augustus at Aquilei, yet was this accusation of his\nsons deferred till they came to Rome, as sect. 3 assures us, and as we\nare particularly informed in the History of the War, B.

But as he was going up to Rome, it happened that he made such\nhaste as to meet with Caesar at the city Aquilei \nso when he came to the speech of Caesar, he asked for a time for hearing\nthis great cause, wherein he thought himself very miserable, and presented\nhis sons there, and accused them of their mad actions, and of their attempts\nagainst him: That they were enemies to him; and by all the means they were\nable, did their endeavors to show their hatred to their own father, and\nwould take away his life, and so obtain his kingdom, after the most barbarous\nmanner: that he had power from Caesar to dispose of it, not by necessity,\nbut by choice, to him who shall exercise the greatest piety towards him;\nwhile these my sons are not so desirous of ruling, as they are, upon a\ndisappointment thereof, to expose their own life, if so be they may but\ndeprive their father of his life; so wild and polluted is their mind by\ntime become, out of their hatred to him: that whereas he had a long time\nborne this his misfortune, he was now compelled to lay it before Caesar,\nand to pollute his ears with such language, while he himself wants to know\nwhat severity they have ever suffered from him, or what hardships he hath\never laid upon them to make them complain of him; and how they can think\nit just that he should not be lord of that kingdom which he in a long time,\nand with great danger, had gained, and not allow him to keep it and dispose\nof it to him who should deserve best; and this, with other advantages,\nhe proposes as a reward for the piety of such a one as will hereafter imitate\nthe care he hath taken of it, and that such a one may gain so great a requital\nas that is: and that it is an impious thing for them to pretend to meddle\nwith it beforehand; for he who hath ever the kingdom in his view, at the\nsame time reckons upon procuring the death of his father, because otherwise\nhe cannot come at the government: that as for himself, he had hitherto\ngiven them all that he was able, and what was agreeable to such as are\nsubject to the royal authority, and the sons of a king; what ornaments\nthey wanted, with servants and delicate fare, and had married them into\nthe most illustrious families, the one [Aristobulus] to his sister's daughter,\nbut Alexander to the daughter of king Archelaus; and, what was the greatest\nfavor of all, when their crimes were so very bad, and he had authority\nto punish them, yet had he not made use of it against them, but had brought\nthem before Caesar, their common benefactor, and had not used the severity\nwhich, either as a father who had been impiously abused, or as a king who\nhad been assaulted treacherously, he might have done, but made them stand\nupon a level with him in judgment: that, however, it was necessary that\nall this should not be passed over without punishment, nor himself live\nin the greatest fears; nay, that it was not for their own advantage to\nsee the light of the sun after what they have done, although they should\nescape at this time, since they had done the vilest things, and would certainly\nsuffer the greatest punishments that ever were known among mankind."}, "These were the accusations which Herod laid with great vehemency\nagainst his sons before Caesar. Now the young men, both while he was speaking,\nand chiefly at his concluding, wept, and were in confusion. Now as to themselves,\nthey knew in their own conscience they were innocent; but because they\nwere accused by their father, they were sensible, as the truth was, that\nit was hard for them to make their apology, since though they were at liberty\nto speak their minds freely as the occasion required, and might with force\nand earnestness refute the accusation, yet was it not now decent so to\ndo. There was therefore a difficulty how they should be able to speak;\nand tears, and at length a deep groan, followed, while they were afraid,\nthat if they said nothing, they should seem to be in this difficulty from\na consciousness of guilt, - nor had they any defense ready, by reason of\ntheir youth, and the disorder they were under; yet was not Caesar unapprized,\nwhen he looked upon them in the confusion they were in, that their delay\nto make their defense did not arise from any consciousness of great enormities,\nbut from their unskilfulness and modesty. They were also commiserated by\nthose that were there in particular; and they moved their father's affections\nin earnest till he had much ado to conceal them.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Since some prejudiced men have indulged a wild suspicion, as we have supposed\nalready, Antiq.

And\nif our open defense may be taken to be true, we shall be happy, both in\npacifying thee, and in escaping the danger we are in; but if this calumny\nso prevails, it is more than enough for us that we have seen the sun this\nday; which why should we see, if this suspicion be fixed upon us? Now it\nis easy to say of young men, that they desire to reign; and to say further,\nthat this evil proceeds from the case of our unhappy mother. This is abundantly\nsufficient to produce our present misfortune out of the former; but consider\nwell, whether such an accusation does not suit all such young men, and\nmay not be said of them all promiscuously; for nothing can hinder him that\nreigns, if he have children, and their mother be dead, but the father may\nhave a suspicion upon all his sons, as intending some treachery to him;\nbut a suspicion is not sufficient to prove such an impious practice. Now\nlet any man say, whether we have actually and insolently attempted any\nsuch thing, whereby actions otherwise incredible use to be made credible?\nCan any body prove that poison hath been prepared? or prove a conspiracy\nof our equals, or the corruption of servants, or letters written against\nthee? though indeed there are none of those things but have sometimes been\npretended by way of calumny, when they were never done; for a royal family\nthat is at variance with itself is a terrible thing; and that which thou\ncallest a reward of piety often becomes, among very wicked men, such a\nfoundation of hope, as makes them leave no sort of mischief untried. Nor\ndoes any one lay any wicked practices to our charge; but as to calumnies\nby hearsay, how can he put an end to them, who will not hear what we have\nto say? Have we talked with too great freedom? Yes; but not against thee,\nfor that would be unjust, but against those that never conceal any thing\nthat is spoken to them. Hath either of us lamented our mother? Yes; but\nnot because she is dead, but because she was evil spoken of by those that\nhad no reason so to do. Are we desirous of that dominion which we know\nour father is possessed of? For what reason can we do so? If we already\nhave royal honors, as we have, should not we labor in vain? And if we have\nthem not, yet are not we in hopes of them? Or supposing that we had killed\nthee, could we expect to obtain thy kingdom? while neither the earth would\nlet us tread upon it, nor the sea let us sail upon it, after such an action\nas that; nay, the religion of all your subjects, and the piety of the whole\nnation, would have prohibited parricides from assuming the government,\nand from entering into that most holy temple which was built by thee \nBut suppose we had made light of other dangers, can any murderer go off\nunpunished while Caesar is alive? We are thy sons, and not so impious or\nso thoughtless as that comes to, though perhaps more unfortunate than is\nconvenient for thee. But in case thou neither findest any causes of complaint,\nnor any treacherous designs, what sufficient evidence hast thou to make\nsuch a wickedness of ours credible? Our mother is dead indeed, but then\nwhat befell her might be an instruction to us to caution, and not an incitement\nto wickedness. We are willing to make a larger apology for ourselves; but\nactions never done do not admit of discourse. Nay, we will make this agreement\nwith thee, and that before Caesar, the lord of all, who is now a mediator\nbetween us, If thou, O father, canst bring thyself, by the evidence of\ntruth, to have a mind free from suspicion concerning us let us live, though\neven then we shall live in an unhappy way, for to be accused of great acts\nof wickedness, though falsely, is a terrible thing; but if thou hast any\nfear remaining, continue thou on in thy pious life, we will give this reason\nfor our own conduct; our life is not so desirable to us as to desire to\nhave it, if it tend to the harm of our father who gave it us.\""}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "See John 2:20.

Indeed he wanted some\napology for making the accusation; but Caesar, after some delay, said,\nthat although the young men were thoroughly innocent of that for which\nthey were calumniated, yet had they been so far to blame, that they had\nnot demeaned themselves towards their father so as to prevent that suspicion\nwhich was spread abroad concerning them. He also exhorted Herod to lay\nall such suspicions aside, and to be reconciled to his sons; for that it\nwas not just to give any credit to such reports concerning his own children;\nand that this repentance on both sides might still heal those breaches\nthat had happened between them, and might improve that their good-will\nto one another, whereby those on both sides, excusing the rashness of their\nsuspicions, might resolve to bear a greater degree of affection towards\neach other than they had before. After Caesar had given them this admonition,\nhe beckoned to the young men.

And when\nHerod was disposed to make such a settlement immediately, Caesar said he\nwould not give him leave to deprive himself, while he was alive, of the\npower over his kingdom, or over his sons.", "After this, Herod returned to Judea again. But during his absence\nno small part of his dominion about Trachon had revolted, whom yet the\ncommanders he left there had vanquished, and compelled to a submission\nagain. Now as Herod was sailing with his sons, and was come over against\nCilicia, to [the island] Eleusa, which hath now changed its name for Sebaste,\nhe met with Archelaus, king of Cappadocia, who received him kindly, as\nrejoicing that he was reconciled to his sons, and that the accusation against\nAlexander, who had married his daughter, was at an end. They also made\none another such presents as it became kings to make, From thence Herod\ncame to Judea and to the temple, where he made a speech to the people concerning\nwhat had been done in this his journey. He also discoursed to them about\nCaesar's kindness to him, and about as many of the particulars he had done\nas he thought it for his advantage other people should be acquainted with.\nAt last he turned his speech to the admonition of his sons; and exhorted\nthose that lived at court, and the multitude, to concord; and informed\nthem that his sons were to reign after him; Antipater first, and then Alexander\nand Aristobulus, the sons of Mariamne: but he desired that at present they\nshould all have regard to himself, and esteem him king and lord of all,\nsince he was not yet hindered by old age, but was in that period of life\nwhen he must be the most skillful in governing; and that he was not deficient\nin other arts of management that might enable him to govern the kingdom\nwell, and to rule over his children also. He further told the rulers under\nhim, and the soldiery, that in case they would look upon him alone, their\nlife would be led in a peaceable manner, and they would make one another\nhappy. And when he had said this, he dismissed the assembly. Which speech\nwas acceptable to the greatest part of the audience, but not so to them\nall; for the contention among his sons, and the hopes he had given them,\noccasioned thoughts and desires of innovations among them.", "ABOUT this time it was that Cesarea Sebaste, which he had built,\nwas finished.

He had also gotten ready a great number of those\nthat fight single combats, and of beasts for the like purpose; horse races\nalso, and the most chargeable of such sports and shows as used to be exhibited\nat Rome, and in other places. He consecrated this combat to Caesar, and\nordered it to be celebrated every fifth year. He also sent all sorts of\nornaments for it out of his own furniture, that it might want nothing to\nmake it decent; nay, Julia, Caesar's wife, sent a great part of her most\nvaluable furniture [from Rome], insomuch that he had no want of any thing.\nThe sum of them all was estimated at five hundred talents. Now when a great\nmultitude was come to that city to see the shows, as well as the ambassadors\nwhom other people sent, on account of the benefits they had received from\nHerod, he entertained them all in the public inns, and at public tables,\nand with perpetual feasts; this solemnity having in the day time the diversions\nof the fights, and in the night time such merry meetings as cost vast sums\nof money, and publicly demonstrated the generosity of his soul; for in\nall his undertakings he was ambitious to exhibit what exceeded whatsoever\nhad been done before of the same kind. And it is related that Caesar and\nAgrippa often said, that the dominions of Herod were too little for the\ngreatness of his soul; for that he deserved to have both all the kingdom\nof Syria, and that of Egypt also.", "After this solemnity and these festivals were over, Herod erected\nanother city in the plain called Capharsaba, where he chose out a fit place,\nboth for plenty of water and goodness of soil, and proper for the production\nof what was there planted, where a river encompassed the city itself, and\na grove of the best trees for magnitude was round about it: this he named\nAntipatris, from his father Antipater. He also built upon another spot\nof ground above Jericho, of the same name with his mother, a place of great\nsecurity and very pleasant for habitation, and called it Cypros. He also\ndedicated the finest monuments to his brother Phasaelus, on account of\nthe great natural affection there had been between them, by erecting a\ntower in the city itself, not less than the tower of Pharos, which he named\nPhasaelus, which was at once a part of the strong defenses of the city,\nand a memorial for him that was deceased, because it bare his name.

As to his own court, therefore, if any one was\nnot very obsequious to him in his language, and would not confess himself\nto be his slave, or but seemed to think of any innovation in his government,\nhe was not able to contain himself, but prosecuted his very kindred and\nfriends, and punished them as if they were enemies and this wickedness\nhe undertook out of a desire that he might be himself alone honored. Now\nfor this, my assertion about that passion of his, we have the greatest\nevidence, by what he did to honor Caesar and Agrippa, and his other friends;\nfor with what honors he paid his respects to them who were his superiors,\nthe same did he desire to be paid to himself; and what he thought the most\nexcellent present he could make another, he discovered an inclination to\nhave the like presented to himself.

As for any money, he found none, as Hyrcanus had done, but that\nfurniture of gold, and those precious goods that were laid up there; all\nwhich he took away. However, he had a great desire to make a more diligent\nsearch, and to go farther in, even as far as the very bodies of David and\nSolomon; where two of his guards were slain, by a flame that burst out\nupon those that went in, as the report was. So he was terribly aftrighted,\nand went out, and built a propitiatory monument of that fright he had been\nin; and this of white stone, at the mouth of the sepulcher, and that at\ngreat expense also. And even Nicolaus \nhis historiographer makes mention of this monument built by Herod, though\nhe does not mention his going down into the sepulcher, as knowing that\naction to be of ill repute; and many other things he treats of in the same\nmanner in his book; for he wrote in Herod's lifetime, and under his reign,\nand so as to please him, and as a servant to him, touching upon nothing\nbut what tended to his glory, and openly excusing many of his notorious\ncrimes, and very diligently concealing them. And as he was desirous to\nput handsome colors on the death of Mariamne and her sons, which were barbarous\nactions in the king, he tells falsehoods about the incontinence of Mariamne,\nand the treacherous designs of his sons upon him; and thus he proceeded\nin his whole work, making a pompous encomium upon what just actions he\nhad done, but earnestly apologizing for his unjust ones. Indeed, a man,\nas I said, may have a great deal to say by way of excuse for Nicolaus;\nfor he did not so properly write this as a history for others, as somewhat\nthat might be subservient to the king himself. As for ourselves, who come\nof a family nearly allied to the Asamonean kings, and on that account have\nan honorable place, which is the priesthood, we think it indecent to say\nany thing that is false about them, and accordingly we have described their\nactions after an unblemished and upright manner. And although we reverence\nmany of Herod's posterity, who still reign, yet do we pay a greater regard\nto truth than to them, and this though it sometimes happens that we incur\ntheir displeasure by so doing."}, "And indeed Herod's troubles in his family seemed to be augmented\nby reason of this attempt he made upon David's sepulcher; whether Divine\nvengeance increased the calamities he lay under, in order to render them\nincurable, or whether fortune made an assault upon him, in those cases\nwherein the seasonableness of the cause made it strongly believed that\nthe calamities came upon him for his impiety; for the tumult was like a\ncivil war in his palace, and their hatred towards one another was like\nthat where each one strove to exceed another in calumnies. However, Antipater\nused stratagems perpetually against his brethren, and that very cunningly;\nwhile abroad he loaded them with accusations, but still took upon him frequently\nto apologize for them, that this apparent benevolence to them might make\nhim be believed, and forward his attempts against them; by which means\nhe, after various manners, circumvented his father, who believed all that\nhe did was for his preservation. Herod also recommended Ptolemy, who was\na great director of the affairs of his kingdom, to Antipater; and consulted\nwith his mother about the public affairs also. And indeed these were all\nin all, and did what they pleased, and made the king angry against any\nother persons, as they thought it might be to their own advantage; but\nstill the sons of Marianme were in a worse and worse condition perpetually;\nand while they were thrust out, and set in a more dishonorable rank, who\nyet by birth were the most noble, they could not bear the dishonor. And\nfor the women, Glaphyra, Alexander's wife, the daughter of Archclaus, hated\nSalome, both because of her love to her husband, and because Glaphyra seemed\nto behave herself somewhat insolently towards Salome's daughter, who was\nthe wife of Aristobulus, which equality of hers to herself Glaphyra took\nvery impatiently.", "Now, besides this second contention that had fallen among them, neither\ndid the king's brother Pheroras keep himself out of trouble, but had a\nparticular foundation for suspicion and hatred; for he was overcome with\nthe charms of his wife, to such a degree of madness, that he despised the\nking's daughter, to whom he had been betrothed, and wholly bent his mind\nto the other, who had been but a servant. Herod also was grieved by the\ndishonor that was done him, because he had bestowed many favors upon him,\nand had advanced him to that height of power that he was almost a partner\nwith him in the kingdom, and saw that he had not made him a due return\nfor his labors, and esteemed himself unhappy on that account. So upon Pheroras's\nunworthy refusal, he gave the damsel to Phasaelus's son; but after some\ntime, when he thought the heat of his brother's affections was over, he\nblamed him for his former conduct, and desired him to take his second daughter,\nwhose name was Cypros. Ptolemy also advised him to leave off affronting\nhis brother, and to forsake her whom he had loved, for that it was a base\nthing to be so enamored of a servant, as to deprive himself of the king's\ngood-will to him, and become an occasion of his trouble, and make himself\nhated by him. Pheroras knew that this advice would be for his own advantage,\nparticularly because he had been accused before, and forgiven; so he put\nhis wife away, although he already had a son by her, and engaged to the\nking that he would take his second daughter, and agreed that the thirtieth\nday after should be the day of marriage; and sware he would have no further\nconversation with her whom he had put away; but when the thirty days were\nover, he was such a slave to his affections, that he no longer performed\nany thing he had promised, but continued still with his former wife. This\noccasioned Herod to grieve openly, and made him angry, while the king dropped\none word or other against Pheroras perpetually; and many made the king's\nanger an opportunity for raising calumnies against him. Nor had the king\nany longer a single quiet day or hour, but occasions of one fresh quarrel\nor another arose among his relations, and those that were dearest to him;\nfor Salome was of a harsh temper, and ill-natured to Mariamne's sons; nor\nwould she suffer her own daughter, who was the wife of Aristobulus, one\nof those young men, to bear a good-will to her husband, but persuaded her\nto tell her if he said any thing to her in private, and when any misunderstandings\nhappened, as is common, she raised a great many suspicions out of it; by\nwhich means she learned all their concerns, and made the damsel ill-natured\nto the young man. And in order to gratify her mother, she often said that\nthe young men used to mention Mariamne when they were by themselves; and\nthat they hated their father, and were continually threatening, that if\nthey had once got the kingdom, they would make Herod's sons by his other\nwives country schoolmasters, for that the present education which was given\nthem, and their diligence in learning, fitted them for such an employment.\nAnd as for the women, whenever they saw them adorned with their mother's\nclothes, they threatened, that instead of their present gaudy apparel,\nthey should be clothed in sackcloth, and confined so closely that they\nshould not see the light of the sun. These stories were presently carried\nby Salome to the king, who was troubled to hear them, and endeavored to\nmake up matters; but these suspicions afflicted him, and becoming more\nand more uneasy, he believed every body against every body. However, upon\nhis rebuking his sons, and hearing the defense they made for themselves,\nhe was easier for a while, though a little afterwards much worse accidents\ncame upon him.", "For Pheroras came to Alexander, the husband of Glaphyra, who was\nthe daughter of Archelaus, as we have already told you, and said that he\nhad heard from Salome that Herod has enamored on Glaphyra, and that his\npassion for her was incurable. When Alexander heard that, he was all on\nfire, from his youth and jealousy; and he interpreted the instances of\nHerod's obliging behavior to her, which were very frequent, for the worse,\nwhich came from those suspicions he had on account of that word which fell\nfrom Pheroras; nor could he conceal his grief at the thing, but informed\nhim what word: Pheroras had said. Upon which Herod was in a greater disorder\nthan ever; and not bearing such a false calumny, which was to his shame,\nwas much disturbed at it; and often did he lament the wickedness of his\ndomestics, and how good he had been to them, and how ill requitals they\nhad made him. So he sent for Pheroras, and reproached him, and said, \"Thou\nvilest of all men! art thou come to that unmeasurable and extravagant degree\nof ingratitude, as not only to suppose such things of me, but to speak\nof them? I now indeed perceive what thy intentions are. It is not thy only\naim to reproach me, when thou usest such words to my son, but thereby to\npersuade him to plot against me, and get me destroyed by poison. And who\nis there, if he had not a good genius at his elbow, as hath my son, but\nwould not bear such a suspicion of his father, but would revenge himself\nupon him? Dost thou suppose that thou hast only dropped a word for him\nto think of, and not rather hast put a sword into his hand to slay his\nfather? And what dost thou mean, when thou really hatest both him and his\nbrother, to pretend kindness to them, only in order to raise a reproach\nagainst me, and talk of such things as no one but such an impious wretch\nas thou art could either devise in their mind, or declare in their words?\nBegone, thou art such a plague to thy benefactor and thy brother, and may\nthat evil conscience of thine go along with thee; while I still overcome\nmy relations by kindness, and am so far from avenging myself of them, as\nthey deserve, that I bestow greater benefits upon them than they are worthy\nof.\"", "Thus did the king speak. Whereupon Pheroras, who was caught in the\nvery act of his villainy, said that \"it was Salome who was the framer\nof this plot, and that the words came from her.\" But as soon as she\nheard that, for she was at hand, she cried out, like one that would be\nbelieved, that no such thing ever came out of her mouth; that they all\nearnestly endeavored to make the king hate her, and to make her away, because\nof the good-will she bore to Herod, and because she was always foreseeing\nthe dangers that were coming upon him, and that at present there were more\nplots against him than usual; for while she was the only person who persuaded\nher brother to put away the wife he now had, and to take the king's daughter,\nit was no wonder if she were hated by him. As she said this, and often\ntore her hair, and often beat her breast, her countenance made her denial\nto be believed; but the peverseness of her manners declared at the same\ntime her dissimulation in these proceedings; but Pheroras was caught between\nthem, and had nothing plausible to offer in his own defense, while he confessed\nthat he had said what was charged upon him, but was not believed when he\nsaid he had heard it from Salome; so the confusion among them was increased,\nand their quarrelsome words one to another. At last the king, out of his\nhatred to his brother and sister, sent them both away; and when he had\ncommended the moderation of his son, and that he had himself told him of\nthe report, he went in the evening to refresh himself. After such a contest\nas this had fallen out among them, Salome's reputation suffered greatly,\nsince she was supposed to have first raised the calumny; and the king's\nwives were grieved at her, as knowing she was a very ill-natured woman,\nand would sometimes be a friend, and sometimes an enemy, at different seasons:\nso they perpetually said one thing or another against her; and somewhat\nthat now fell out made them the bolder in speaking against her.", "There was one Obodas, king of Arabia, an inactive and slothful man\nin his nature; but Sylleus managed most of his affairs for him. He was\na shrewd man, although he was but young, and was handsome withal. This\nSylleus, upon some occasion coining to Herod, and supping with him, saw\nSalome, and set his heart upon her; and understanding that she was a widow,\nhe discoursed with her. Now because Salome was at this time less in favor\nwith her brother, she looked upon Sylleus with some passion, and was very\nearnest to be married to him; and on the days following there appeared\nmany, and those very great, indications of their agreement together. Now\nthe women carried this news to the king, and laughed at the indecency of\nit; whereupon Herod inquired about it further of Pheroras, and desired\nhim to observe them at supper, how their behavior was one toward another;\nwho told him, that by the signals which came from their heads and their\neyes, they both were evidently in love. After this, Sylleus the Arabian\nbeing suspected, went away, but came again in two or three months afterwards,\nas it were on that very design, and spake to Herod about it, and desired\nthat Salome might be given him to wife; for that his affinity might not\nbe disadvantageous to his affairs, by a union with Arabia, the government\nof which country was already in effect under his power, and more evidently\nwould be his hereafter. Accordingly, when Herod discoursed with his sister\nabout it, and asked her whether she were disposed to this match, she immediately\nagreed to it. But when Sylleus was desired to come over to the Jewish religion,\nand then he should marry her, and that it was impossible to do it on any\nother terms, he could not bear that proposal, and went his way; for he\nsaid, that if he should do so, he should be stoned by the Arabs. Then did\nPheroras reproach Salome for her incontinency, as did the women much more;\nand said that Sylleus had debauched her. As for that damsel which the king\nhad betrothed to his brother Pheroras, but he had not taken her, as I have\nbefore related, because he was enamored on his former wife, Salome desired\nof Herod she might be given to her son by Costobarus; which match he was\nvery willing to, but was dissuaded from it by Pheroras, who pleaded that\nthis young man would not be kind to her, since his father had been slain\nby him, and that it was more just that his son, who was to be his successor\nin the tetrarchy, should have her. So he begged his pardon, and persuaded\nhim to do so. Accordingly the damsel, upon this change of her espousals,\nwas disposal of to this young man, the son of Pheroras, the king giving\nfor her portion a hundred talents.", "BUT still the affairs of Herod's family were no better, but perpetually\nmore troublesome. Now this accident happened, which arose from no decent\noccasion, but proceeded so far as to bring great difficulties upon him.\nThere were certain eunuchs which the king had, and on account of their\nbeauty was very fond of them; and the care of bringing him drink was intrusted\nto one of them; of bringing him his supper, to another; and of putting\nhim to bed, to the third, who also managed the principal affairs of the\ngovernment; and there was one told the king that these eunuchs were corrupted\nby Alexander the king's son with great sums of money. And when they were\nasked whether Alexander had had criminal conversation with them, they confessed\nit, but said they knew of no further mischief of his against his father;\nbut when they were more severely tortured, and were in the utmost extremity,\nand the tormentors, out of compliance with Antipater, stretched the rack\nto the very utmost, they said that Alexander bare great ill-will and innate\nhatred to his father; and that he told them that Herod despaired to live\nmuch longer; and that, in order to cover his great age, he colored his\nhair black, and endeavored to conceal what would discover how old he was;\nbut that if he would apply himself to him, when he should attain the kingdom,\nwhich, in spite of his father, could come to no one else, he should quickly\nhave the first place in that kingdom under him, for that he was now ready\nto take the kingdom, not only as his birth-right, but by the preparations\nhe had made for obtaining it, because a great many of the rulers, and a\ngreat many of his friends, were of his side, and those no ill men neither,\nready both to do and to suffer whatsoever should come on that account.", "When Herod heard this confession, he was all over anger and fear,\nsome parts seeming to him reproachful, and some made him suspicious of\ndangers that attended him, insomuch that on both accounts he was provoked,\nand bitterly afraid lest some more heavy plot was laid against him than\nhe should be then able to escape from; whereupon he did not now make an\nopen search, but sent about spies to watch such as he suspected, for he\nwas now overrun with suspicion and hatred against all about him; and indulging\nabundance of those suspicions, in order to his preservation, he continued\nto suspect those that were guiltless; nor did he set any bounds to himself,\nbut supposing that those who staid with him had the most power to hurt\nhim, they were to him very frightful; and for those that did not use to\ncome to him, it seemed enough to name them [to make them suspected], and\nhe thought himself safer when they were destroyed. And at last his domestics\nwere come to that pass, that being no way secure of escaping themselves,\nthey fell to accusing one another, and imagining that he who first accused\nanother was most likely to save himself; yet when any had overthrown others,\nthey were hated; and they were thought to suffer justly who unjustly accused\nothers, and they only thereby prevented their own accusation; nay, they\nnow executed their own private enmities by this means, and when they were\ncaught, they were punished in the same way. Thus these men contrived to\nmake use of this opportunity as an instrument and a snare against their\nenemies; yet when they tried it, were themselves caught also in the same\nsnare which they laid for others: and the king soon repented of what he\nhad done, because he had no clear evidence of the guilt of those whom he\nhad slain; and yet what was still more severe in him, he did not make use\nof his repentance, in order to leave off doing the like again, but in order\nto inflict the same punishment upon their accusers.", "And in this state of disorder were the affairs of the palace; and\nhe had already told many of his friends directly that they ought not to\nappear before him, her come into the palace; and the reason of this injunction\nwas, that [when they were there], he had less freedom of acting, or a greater\nrestraint on himself on their account; for at this time it was that he\nexpelled Andromachus and Gamellus, men who had of old been his friends,\nand been very useful to him in the affairs of his kingdom, and been of\nadvantage to his family, by their embassages and counsels; and had been\ntutors to his sons, and had in a manner the first degree of freedom with\nhim. He expelled Andromachus, because his son Demetrius was a companion\nto Alexander; and Gamellus, because he knew that he wished him well, which\narose from his having been with him in his youth, when he was at school,\nand absent at Rome. These he expelled out of his palace, and was willing\nenough to have done worse by them; but that he might not seem to take such\nliberty against men of so great reputation, he contented himself with depriving\nthem of their dignity, and of their power to hinder his wicked proceedings.", "Now it was Antipater who was the cause of all this; who when he knew\nwhat a mad and licentious way of acting his father was in, and had been\na great while one of his counselors, he hurried him on, and then thought\nhe should bring him to do somewhat to purpose, when every one that could\noppose him was taken away. When therefore Andromachus and his friends were\ndriven away, and had no discourse nor freedom with the king any longer,\nthe king, in the first place, examined by torture all whom he thought to\nbe faithful to Alexander, Whether they knew of any of his attempts against\nhim; but these died without having any thing to say to that matter, which\nmade the king more zealous [after discoveries], when he could not find\nout what evil proceedings he suspected them of. As for Antipater, he was\nvery sagacious to raise a calumny against those that were really innocent,\nas if their denial was only their constancy and fidelity [to Alexander],\nand thereupon provoked Herod to discover by the torture of great numbers\nwhat attempts were still concealed. Now there was a certain person among\nthe many that were tortured, who said that he knew that the young man had\noften said, that when he was commended as a tall man in his body, and a\nskillful marksman, and that in his other commendable exercises he exceeded\nall men, these qualifications given him by nature, though good in themselves,\nwere not advantageous to him, because his father was grieved at them, and\nenvied him for them; and that when he walked along with his father, he\nendeavored to depress and shorten himself, that he might not appear too\ntall; and that when he shot at any thing as he was hunting, when his father\nwas by, he missed his mark on purpose, for he knew how ambitious his father\nwas of being superior in such exercises. So when the man was tormented\nabout this saying, and had ease given his body after it, he added, that\nhe had his brother Aristobulus for his assistance, and contrived to lie\nin wait for their father, as they were hunting, and kill him; and when\nthey had done so to fly to Rome, and desire to have the kingdom given them.\nThere were also letters of the young man found, written to his brother,\nwherein he complained that his father did not act justly in giving Antipater\na country, whose [yearly] revenues amounted to two hundred talents. Upon\nthese confessions Herod presently thought he had somewhat to depend on,\nin his own opinion, as to his suspicion about his sons; so he took up Alexander\nand bound him: yet did he still continue to be uneasy, and was not quite\nsatisfied of the truth of what he had heard; and when he came to recollect\nhimself, he found that they had only made juvenile complaints and contentions,\nand that it was an incredible thing, that when his son should have slain\nhim, he should openly go to Rome [to beg the kingdom]; so he was desirous\nto have some surer mark of his son's wickedness, and was very solicitous\nabout it, that he might not appear to have condemned him to be put in prison\ntoo rashly; so he tortured the principal of Alexander's friends, and put\nnot a few of them to death, without getting any of the things out of them\nwhich he suspected. And while Herod was very busy about this matter, and\nthe palace was full of terror and trouble, one of the younger sort, when\nhe was in the utmost agony, confessed that Alexander had sent to his friends\nat Rome, and desired that he might be quickly invited thither by Caesar,\nand that he could discover a plot against him; that Mithridates, the king\nof Parthia, was joined in friendship with his father against the Romans,\nand that he had a poisonous potion ready prepared at Askelori.", "To these accusations Herod gave credit, and enjoyed hereby, in his\nmiserable case, some sort of consolation, in excuse of his rashness, as\nfiattering himself with finding things in so bad a condition; but as for\nthe poisonous potion, which he labored to find, he could find none. As\nfor Alexander, he was very desirous to aggravate the vast misfortunes he\nwas under, so he pretended not to deny the accusations, but punished the\nrashness of his father with a greater crime of his own; and perhaps he\nwas willing to make his father ashamed of his easy belief of such calumnies:\nhe aimed especially, if he could gain belief to his story, to plague him\nand his whole kingdom; for he wrote four letters, and sent them to him,\nthat he did not need to torture any more persons, for he had plotted against\nhim; and that he had for his partners Pheroras and the most faithful of\nhis friends; and that Salome came in to him by night, and that she lay\nwith him whether he would or not; and that all men were come to be of one\nmind, to make away with him as soon as they could, and so get clear of\nthe continual fear they were in from him. Among these were accused Ptolemy\nand Sapinnius, who were the most faithful friends to the king. And what\nmore can be said, but that those who before were the most intimate friends,\nwere become wild beasts to one another, as if a certain madness had fallen\nupon them, while there was no room for defense or refutation, in order\nto the discovery of the truth, but all were at random doomed to destruction;\nso that some lamented those that were in prison, some those that were put\nto death, and others lamented that they were in expectation of the same\nmiseries; and a melancholy solitude rendered the kingdom deformed, and\nquite the reverse to that happy state it was formerly in. Herod's own life\nalso was entirely disturbed; and because he could trust nobody, he was\nsorely punished by the expectation of further misery; for he often fancied\nin his imagination that his son had fallen upon him, or stood by him with\na sword in his hand; and thus was his mind night and day intent upon this\nthing, and revolved it over and over, no otherwise than if he were under\na distraction. And this was the sad condition Herod was now in.", "But when Archelaus, king of Cappadocia, heard of the state that Herod\nwas in, and being in great distress about his daughter, and the young man\n[her husband], and grieving with Herod, as with a man that was his friend,\non account of so great a disturbance as he was under, he came [to Jerusalem]\non purpose to compose their differences; and when he found Herod in such\na temper, he thought it wholly unseasonable to reprove him, or to pretend\nthat he had done any thing rashly, for that he should thereby naturally\nbring him to dispute the point with him, and by still more and more apologizing\nfor himself to be the more irritated: he went, therefore, another way to\nwork, in order to correct the former misfortunes, and appeared angry at\nthe young man, and said that Herod had been so very mild a man, that he\nhad not acted a rash part at all. He also said he would dissolve his daughter's\nmarriage with Alexander, nor could in justice spare his own daughter, if\nshe were conscious of any thing, and did not inform Herod of it. When Archelaus\nappeared to be of this temper, and otherwise than Herod expected or imagined,\nand, for the main, took Herod's part, and was angry on his account, the\nking abated of his harshness, and took occasion from his appearing to have\nacted justly hitherto, to come by degrees to put on the affection of a\nfather, and was on both sides to be pitied; for when some persons refuted\nthe calumnies that were laid on the young man, he was thrown into a passion;\nbut when Archclaus joined in the accusation, he was dissolved into tears\nand sorrow after an affectionate manner. Accordingly, he desired that he\nwould not dissolve his son's marriage, and became not so angry as before\nfor his offenses. So when Archclaus had brought him to a more moderate\ntemper, he transferred the calumnies upon his friends; and said it must\nbe owing to them that so young a man, and one unacquainted with malice,\nwas corrupted; and he supposed that there was more reason to suspect the\nbrother than the soft. Upon which Herod was very much displeased at Pheroras,\nwho indeed now had no one that could make a reconciliation between him\nand his brother. So when he saw that Archclaus had the greatest power with\nHerod, he betook himself to him in the habit of a mourner, and like one\nthat had all the signs upon him of an undone man. Upon this Archclaus did\nnot overlook the intercession he made to him, nor yet did he undertake\nto change the king's disposition towards him immediately; and he said that\nit was better for him to come himself to the king, and confess himself\nthe occasion of all; that this would make the king's anger not to be extravagant\ntowards him, and that then he would be present to assist him. When he had\npersuaded him to this, he gained his point with both of them; and the calumnies\nraised against the young man were, beyond all expectation, wiped off. And\nArchclaus, as soon as he had made the reconciliation, went then away to\nCappadocia, having proved at this juncture of time the most acceptable\nperson to Herod in the world; on which account he gave him the richest\npresents, as tokens of his respects to him; and being on other occasions\nmagnanimous, he esteemed him one of his dearest friends. He also made an\nagreement with him that he would go to Rome, because he had written to\nCaesar about these affairs; so they went together as far as Antioch, and\nthere Herod made a reconciliation between Archclaus and Titus, the president\nof Syria, who had been greatly at variance, and so returned back to Judea.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "These joint presidents of Syria, Saturninus and Volumnius, were not perhaps\nof equal authority, but the latter like a procurator under the former,\nas the very learned Noris and Pagi, and with them Dr. Hudson, determine."}, "#text": "WHEN Herod had been at Rome, and was come back again, a war arose\nbetween him and the Arabians, on the occasion following: The inhabitants\nof Trachonitis, after Caesar had taken the country away from Zenodorus,\nand added it to Herod, had not now power to rob, but were forced to plough\nthe land, and to live quietly, which was a thing they did not like; and\nwhen they did take that pains, the ground did not produce much fruit for\nthem. However, at the first the king would not permit them to rob, and\nso they abstained from that unjust way of living upon their neighbors,\nwhich procured Herod a great reputation for his care. But when he was sailing\nto Rome, it was at that time when he went to accuse his son Alexander,\nand to commit Antipater to Caesar's protection, the Trachonites spread\na report as if he were dead, and revolted from his dominion, and betook\nthemselves again to their accustomed way of robbing their neighbors; at\nwhich time the king's commanders subdued them during his absence; but about\nforty of the principal robbers, being terrified by those that had been\ntaken, left the country, and retired into Arabia, Sylleus entertaining\nthem, after he had missed of marrying Salome, and gave them a place of\nstrength, in which they dwelt. So they overran not only Judea, but all\nCelesyria also, and carried off the prey, while Sylleus afforded them places\nof protection and quietness during their wicked practices. But when Herod\ncame back from Rome, he perceived that his dominions had greatly suffered\nby them; and since he could not reach the robbers themselves, because of\nthe secure retreat they had in that country, and which the Arabian government\nafforded them, and yet being very uneasy at the injuries they had done\nhim, he went all over Trachonitis, and slew their relations; whereupon\nthese robbers were more angry than before, it being a law among them to\nbe avenged on the murderers of their relations by all possible means; so\nthey continued to tear and rend every thing under Herod's dominion with\nimpunity. Then did he discourse about these robberies to Saturninus and\nVolumnius, and required that they should be punished; upon which occasion\nthey still the more confirmed themselves in their robberies, and became\nmore numerous, and made very great disturbances, laying waste the countries\nand villages that belonged to Herod's kingdom, and killing those men whom\nthey caught, till these unjust proceedings came to be like a real war,\nfor the robbers were now become about a thousand; - at which Herod was\nsore displeased, and required the robbers, as well as the money which he\nhad lent Obodas, by Sylleus, which was sixty talents, and since the time\nof payment was now past, he desired to have it paid him; but Sylleus, who\nhad laid Obodas aside, and managed all by himself, denied that the robbers\nwere in Arabia, and put off the payment of the money; about which there\nwas a hearing before Saturninus and Volumnius, who were then the presidents\nof Syria. \nAt last he, by their means, agreed, that within thirty days' time Herod\nshould be paid his money, and that each of them should deliver up the other's\nsubjects reciprocally. Now, as to Herod, there was not one of the other's\nsubjects found in his kingdom, either as doing any injustice, or on any\nother account, but it was proved that the Arabians had the robbers amongst\nthem."}, "When this day appointed for payment of the money was past, without\nSylleus's performing any part of his agreement, and he was gone to Rome,\nHerod demanded the payment of the money, and that the robbers that were\nin Arabia should be delivered up; and, by the permission of Saturninus\nand Volumnius, executed the judgment himself upon those that were refractory.\nHe took an army that he had, and let it into Arabia, and in three days'\ntime marched seven mansions; and when he came to the garrison wherein the\nrobbers were, he made an assault upon them, and took them all, and demolished\nthe place, which was called Raepta, but did no harm to any others. But\nas the Arabians came to their assistance, under Naceb their captain, there\nensued a battle, wherein a few of Herod's soldiers, and Naceb, the captain\nof the Arabians, and about twenty of his soldiers, fell, while the rest\nbetook themselves to flight. So when he had brought these to punishment,\nhe placed three thousand Idumeans in Trachonitis, and thereby restrained\nthe robbers that were there. He also sent an account to the captains that\nwere about Phoenicia, and demonstrated that he had done nothing but what\nhe ought to do, in punishing the refractory Arabians, which, upon an exact\ninquiry, they found to be no more than what was true.", "However, messengers were hasted away to Sylleus to Rome, and informed\nhim what had been done, and, as is usual, aggravated every thing. Now Sylleus\nhad already insinuated himself into the knowledge of Caesar, and was then\nabout the palace; and as soon as he heard of these things, he changed his\nhabit into black, and went in, and told Caesar that Arabia was afflicted\nwith war, and that all his kingdom was in great confusion, upon Herod's\nlaying it waste with his army; and he said, with tears in his eyes, that\ntwo thousand five hundred of the principal men among the Arabians had been\ndestroyed, and that their captain Nacebus, his familiar friend and kinsman,\nwas slain; and that the riches that were at Raepta were carried off; and\nthat Obodas was despised, whose infirm state of body rendered him unfit\nfor war; on which account neither he, nor the Arabian army, were present.\nWhen Sylleus said so, and added invidiously, that he would not himself\nhave come out of the country, unless he had believed that Caesar would\nhave provided that they should all have peace one with another, and that,\nhad he been there, he would have taken care that the war should not have\nbeen to Herod's advantage; Caesar was provoked when this was said, and\nasked no more than this one question, both of Herod's friends that were\nthere, and of his own friends, who were come from Syria, Whether Herod\nhad led an army thither? And when they were forced to confess so much,\nCaesar, without staying to hear for what reason he did it, and how it was\ndone, grew very angry, and wrote to Herod sharply. The sum of his epistle\nwas this, that whereas of old he had used him as his friend, he should\nnow use him as his subject. Sylleus also wrote an account of this to the\nArabians, who were so elevated with it, that they neither delivered up\nthe robbers that had fled to them, nor paid the money that was due; they\nretained those pastures also which they had hired, and kept them without\npaying their rent, and all this because the king of the Jews was now in\na low condition, by reason of Caesar's anger at him. Those of Trachonitis\nalso made use of this opportunity, and rose up against the Idumean garrison,\nand followed the same way of robbing with the Arabians, who had pillaged\ntheir country, and were more rigid in their unjust proceedings, not only\nin order to get by it, but by way of revenge also.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This Aretas was now become so established a name for the kings of Arabia,\n[at Petra and Damascus,] that when the crown came to this Aeneas, he changed\nhis name to Aretas, as Havercamp here justly observes.

So he was\ncast into sadness and fear; and Sylleus's circumstances grieved him exceedingly,\nwho was now believed by Caesar, and was present at Rome, nay, sometimes\naspiring higher. Now it came to pass that Obodas was dead; and Aeneas,\nwhose name was afterward changed to Aretas, \ntook the government, for Sylleus endeavored by calumnies to get him turned\nout of his principality, that he might himself take it; with which design\nhe gave much money to the courtiers, and promised much money to Caesar,\nwho indeed was angry that Aretas had not sent to him first before he took\nthe kingdom; yet did Aeneas send an epistle and presents to Caesar, and\na golden crown, of the weight of many talents. Now that epistle accused\nSylleus as having been a wicked servant, and having killed Obodas by poison;\nand that while he was alive, he had governed him as he pleased; and had\nalso debauched the wives of the Arabians; and had borrowed money, in order\nto obtain the dominion for himself: yet did not Caesar give heed to these\naccusations, but sent his ambassadors back, without receiving any of his\npresents. But in the mean time the affairs of Judea and Arabia became worse\nand worse, partly because of the anarchy they were under, and partly because,\nas bad as they were, nobody had power to govern them; for of the two kings,\nthe one was not yet confirmed in his kingdom, and so had not authority\nsufficient to restrain the evil-doers; and as for Herod, Caesar was immediately\nangry at him for having avenged himself, and so he was compelled to bear\nall the injuries that were offered him. At length, when he saw no end of\nthe mischief which surrounded him, he resolved to send ambassadors to Rome\nagain, to see whether his friends had prevailed to mitigate Caesar, and\nto address themselves to Caesar himself; and the ambassador he sent thither\nwas Nicolans of Damascus."}, "THE disorders about Herod's family and children about this time grew\nmuch worse; for it now appeared certain, nor was it unforeseen before-hand,\nthat fortune threatened the greatest and most insupportable misfortunes\npossible to his kingdom. Its progress and augmentation at this time arose\non the occasion following: One Eurycles, a Lacedemonian, (a person of note\nthere, but a man of a perverse mind, and so cunning in his ways of voluptuousness\nand flattery, as to indulge both, and yet seem to indulge neither of them,)\ncame in his travels to Herod, and made him presents, but so that he received\nmore presents from him. He also took such proper seasons for insinuating\nhimself into his friendship, that he became one of the most intimate of\nthe king's friends. He had his lodging in Antipater's house; but he had\nnot only access, but free conversation, with Alexander, as pretending to\nhim that he was in great favor with Archclaus, the king of Cappadocia;\nwhence he pretended much respect to Glaphyra, and in an occult manner cultivated\na friendship with them all; but always attending to what was said and done,\nthat he might be furnished with calumnies to please them all. In short,\nhe behaved himself so to every body in his conversation, as to appear to\nbe his particular friend, and he made others believe that his being any\nwhere was for that person's advantage. So he won upon Alexander, who was\nbut young; and persuaded him that he might open his grievances to him with\nassurance and with nobody else. So he declared his grief to him, how his\nfather was alienated from him. He related to him also the affairs of his\nmother, and of Antipater; that he had driven them from their proper dignity,\nand had the power over every thing himself; that no part of this was tolerable,\nsince his father was already come to hate them; and he added, that he would\nneither admit them to his table, nor to his conversation. Such were the\ncomplaints, as was but natural, of Alexander about the things that troubled\nhim; and these discourses Eurycles carried to Antipater, and told him he\ndid not inform him of this on his own account, but that being overcome\nby his kindness, the great importance of the thing obliged him to do it;\nand he warned him to have a care of Alexander, for that what he said was\nspoken with vehemency, and that, in consequence of what he said, he would\ncertainly kill him with his own hand. Whereupon Antipater, thinking him\nto be his friend by this advice, gave him presents upon all occasions,\nand at length persuaded him to inform Herod of what he had heard. So when\nhe related to the king Alexander's ill temper, as discovered by the words\nhe had heard him speak, he was easily believed by him; and he thereby brought\nthe king to that pass, turning him about by his words, and irritating him,\ntill he increased his hatred to him and made him implacable, which he showed\nat that very time, for he immediately gave Eurycles a present of fifty\ntalents; who, when he had gotten them, went to Archclaus, king of Cappadocia,\nand commended Alexander before him, and told him that he had been many\nways of advantage to him, in making a reconciliation between him and his\nfather. So he got money from him also, and went away, before his pernicious\npractices were found out; but when Eurycles was returned to Lacedemon,\nhe did not leave off doing mischief; and so, for his many acts of injustice,\nhe was banished from his own country.", "But as for the king of the Jews, he was not now in the temper he\nwas in formerly towards Alexander and Aristobulus, when he had been content\nwith the hearing their calumnies when others told him of them; but he was\nnow come to that pass as to hate them himself, and to urge men to speak\nagainst them, though they did not do it of themselves. He also observed\nall that was said, and put questions, and gave ear to every one that would\nbut speak, if they could but say any thing against them, till at length\nhe heard that Euaratus of Cos was a conspirator with Alexander; which thing\nto Herod was the most agreeable and sweetest news imaginable.", "But still a greater misfortune came upon the young men; while the\ncalumnies against them were continually increased, and, as a man may say,\none would think it was every one's endeavor to lay some grievous thing\nto their charge, which might appear to be for the king's preservation.\nThere were two guards of Herod's body, who were in great esteem for their\nstrength and tallness, Jucundus and Tyrannus; these men had been cast off\nby Herod, who was displeased at them; these now used to ride along with\nAlexander, and for their skill in their exercises were in great esteem\nwith him, and had some gold and other gifts bestowed on them. Now the king\nhaving an immediate suspicion of those men, had them tortured, who endured\nthe torture courageously for a long time; but at last confessed that Alexander\nwould have persuaded them to kill Herod, when he was in pursuit of the\nwild beasts, that it might be said he fell from his horse, and was run\nthrough with his own spear, for that he had once such a misfortune formerly.\nThey also showed where there was money hidden in the stable under ground;\nand these convicted the king's chief hunter, that he had given the young\nmen the royal hunting spears and weapons to Alexander's dependents, at\nAlexander's command.", "After these, the commander of the garrison of Alexandrium was caught\nand tortured; for he was accused to have promised to receive the young\nmen into his fortress, and to supply them with that money of the king's\nwhich was laid up in that fortress, yet did not he acknowledge any thing\nof it himself; but his son came ill, and said it was so, and delivered\nup the writing, which, so far as could be guessed, was in Alexander's hand.\nIts contents were these: \"When we have finished, by God's help, all\nthat we have proposed to do, we will come to you; but do your endeavors,\nas you have promised, to receive us into your fortress.\" After this\nwriting was produced, Herod had no doubt about the treacherous designs\nof his sons against him. But Alexander said that Diophantus the scribe\nhad imitated his hand, and that the paper was maliciously drawn up by Antipater;\nfor Diophantus appeared to be very cunning in such practices; and as he\nwas afterward convicted of forging other papers, he was put to death for\nit.", "So the king produced those that had been tortured before the multitude\nat Jericho, in order to have them accuse the young men, which accusers\nmany of the people stoned to death; and when they were going to kill Alexander\nand Aristobulus likewise, the king would not permit them to do so, but\nrestrained the multitude, by the means of Ptolemy and Pheroras. However,\nthe young men were put under a guard, and kept in custody, that nobody\nmight come at them; and all that they did or said was watched, and the\nreproach and fear they were in was little or nothing different from those\nof condemned criminals: and one of them, who was Aristobulus, was so deeply\naffected, that he brought Salome, who was his aunt, and his mother-in-law,\nto lament with him for his calamities, and to hate him who had suffered\nthings to come to that pass; when he said to her, \"Art thou not in\ndanger of destruction also, while the report goes that thou hadst disclosed\nbeforehand all our affairs to Syllcus, when thou wast in hopes of being\nmarried to him?\" But she immediately carried these words to her brother.\nUpon this he was out of patience, and gave command to bind him; and enjoined\nthem both, now they were kept separate one from the other, to write down\nthe ill things they had done against their father, and bring the writings\nto him, So when this was enjoined them, they wrote this, that they had\nlaid no treacherous designs, nor made any preparations against their father,\nbut that they had intended to fly away; and that by the distress they were\nin, their lives being now uncertain and tedious to them.", "About this time there came an ambassador out of Cappadocia from Archelaus,\nwhose name was Melas; he was one of the principal rulers under him. So\nHerod, being desirous to show Archelaus's ill-will to him, called for Alexander,\nas he was in his bonds, and asked him again concerning his fight, whether\nand how they had resolved to retire Alexander replied, To Archclaus, who\nhad promised to send them away to Rome; but that they had no wicked nor\nmischievous designs against their father, and that nothing of that nature\nwhich their adversaries had charged upon them was true; and that their\ndesire was, that he might have examined Tyrannus and Jucundus more strictly,\nbut that they had been suddenly slain by the means of Antipater, who put\nhis own friends among the multitude [for that purpose].", "When this was said, Herod commanded that both Alexander and Melas\nshould be carried to Glaphyra, Archelaus's daughter, and that she should\nbe asked, whether she did not know somewhat of Alexander's treacherous\ndesigns against Herod? Now as soon as they were come to her, and she saw\nAlexander in bonds, she beat her head, and in a great consternation gave\na deep and moving groan. The young man also fell into tears. This was so\nmiserable a spectacle to those present, that, for a great while, they were\nnot able to say or to do any thing; but at length Ptolemy, who was ordered\nto bring Alexander, bid him say whether his wife was conscious of his actions.\nHe replied, \"How is it possible that she, whom I love better than\nmy own soul, and by whom I have had children, should not know what I do?\"\nUpon which she cried out that she knew of no wicked designs of his; but\nthat yet, if her accusing herself falsely would tend to his preservation,\nshe would confess it all. Alexander replied, \"There is no such wickedness\nas those (who ought the least of all so to do) suspect, which either I\nhave imagined, or thou knowest of, but this only, that we had resolved\nto retire to Archelaus, and from thence to Rome.\" Which she also confessed.\nUpon which Herod, supposing that Archelaus's ill-will to him was fully\nproved, sent a letter by Olympus and Volumnius; and bid them, as they sailed\nby, to touch at Eleusa of Cilicia, and give Archelaus the letter. And that\nwhen they had ex-postulated with him, that he had a hand in his son's treacherous\ndesign against him, they should from thence sail to Rome; and that, in\ncase they found Nicolaus had gained any ground, and that Caesar was no\nlonger displeased at him, he should give him his letters, and the proofs\nwhich he had ready to show against the young men. As to Archelaus, he made\nhis defense for himself, that he had promised to receive the young men,\nbecause it was both for their own and their father's advantage so to do,\nlest some too severe procedure should be gone upon in that anger and disorder\nthey were in on occasion of the present suspicions; but that still he had\nnot promised to send them to Caesar; and that he had not promised any thing\nelse to the young men that could show any ill-will to him.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This oath, by the fortune of Caesar, was put to Polycarp, a bishop of Smyrna,\nby the Roman governor, to try whether he were a Christian, as they were\nthen esteemed who refused to swear that oath. Martyr. Polycarp, sect. 9."}, "#text": "When these ambassadors were come to Rome, they had a fit opportunity\nof delivering their letters to Caesar, because they found him reconciled\nto Herod; for the circumstances of Nicolaus's embassage had been as follows:\nAs soon as he was come to Rome, and was about the court, he did not first\nof all set about what he was come for only, but he thought fit also to\naccuse Sylleus. Now the Arabians, even before he came to talk with them,\nwere quarrelling one with another; and some of them left Sylleus's party,\nand joining themselves to Nicolaus, informed him of all the wicked things\nthat had been done; and produced to him evident demonstrations of the slaughter\nof a great number of Obodas's friends by Sylleus; for when these men left\nSylleus, they had carried off with them those letters whereby they could\nconvict him. When Nicolaus saw such an opportunity afforded him, he made\nuse of it, in order to gain his own point afterward, and endeavored immediately\nto make a reconciliation between Caesar and Herod; for he was fully satisfied,\nthat if he should desire to make a defense for Herod directly, he should\nnot be allowed that liberty; but that if he desired to accuse Sylleus,\nthere would an occasion present itself of speaking on Herod's behalf. So\nwhen the cause was ready for a hearing, and the day was appointed, Nicolaus,\nwhile Aretas's ambassadors were present, accused Sylleus, and said that\nhe imputed to him the destruction of the king [Obodas], and of many others\nof the Arabians; that he had borrowed money for no good design; and he\nproved that he had been guilty of adultery, not only with the Arabian,\nbut Reinan women also. And. he added, that above all the rest he had alienated\nCaesar from Herod, and that all that he had said about the actions of Herod\nwere falsities. When Nicolaus was come to this topic, Caesar stopped him\nfrom going on, and desired him only to speak to this affair of Herod, and\nto show that he had not led an army into Arabia, nor slain two thousand\nfive hundred men there, nor taken prisoners, nor pillaged the country.\nTo which Nicolaus made this answer: \"I shall principally demonstrate,\nthat either nothing at all, or but a very little, of those imputations\nare true, of which thou hast been informed; for had they been true, thou\nmightest justly have been still more angry at Herod.\" At this strange\nassertion Caesar was very attentive; and Nicolaus said that there was a\ndebt due to Herod of five hundred talents, and a bond, wherein it was written,\nthat if the time appointed be lapsed, it should be lawful to make a seizure\nout of any part of his country. \"As for the pretended army,\"\nhe said, \"it was no army, but a party sent out to require the just\npayment of the money; that this was not sent immediately, nor so soon as\nthe bond allowed, but that Sylleus had frequently come before Saturninus\nand Volumnius, the presidents of Syria; and that at last he had sworn at\nBerytus, by thy fortune, \nthat he would certainly pay the money within thirty days, and deliver up\nthe fugitives that were under his dominion. And that when Sylleus had performed\nnothing of this, Herod came again before the presidents; and upon their\npermission to make a seizure for his money, he, with difficulty, went out\nof his country with a party of soldiers for that purpose. And this is all\nthe war which these men so tragically describe; and this is the affair\nof the expedition into Arabia. And how can this be called a war, when thy\npresidents permitted it, the covenants allowed it, and it was not executed\ntill thy name, O Caesar, as well as that of the other gods, had been profaned?\nAnd now I must speak in order about the captives. There were robbers that\ndwelt in Trachonitis; at first their number was no more than forty, but\nthey became more afterwards, and they escaped the punishment Herod would\nhave inflicted on them, by making Arabia their refuge. Sylleus received\nthem, and supported them with food, that they might be mischievous to all\nmankind, and gave them a country to inhabit, and himself received the gains\nthey made by robbery; yet did he promise that he would deliver up these\nmen, and that by the same oaths and same time that he sware and fixed for\npayment of his debt: nor can he by any means show that any other persons\nhave at this time been taken out of Arabia besides these, and indeed not\nall these neither, but only so many as could not conceal themselves. And\nthus does the calumny of the captives, which hath been so odiously represented,\nappear to be no better than a fiction and a lie, made on purpose to provoke\nthy indignation; for I venture to affirm that when the forces of the Arabians\ncame upon us, and one or two of Herod's party fell, he then only defended\nhimself, and there fell Nacebus their general, and in all about twenty-five\nothers, and no more; whence Sylleus, by multiplying every single soldier\nto a hundred, he reckons the slain to have been two thousand five hundred.\""}, "This provoked Caesar more than ever. So he turned to Sylleus full\nof rage, and asked him how many of the Arabians were slain. Hereupon he\nhesitated, and said he had been imposed upon. The covenants also were read\nabout the money he had borrowed, and the letters of the presidents of Syria,\nand the complaints of the several cities, so many as had been injured by\nthe robbers. The conclusion was this, that Sylleus was condemned to die,\nand that Caesar was reconciled to Herod, and owned his repentance for what\nsevere things he had written to him, occasioned by calumny, insomuch that\nhe told Sylleus, that he had compelled him, by his lying account of things,\nto be guilty of ingratitude against a man that was his friend. At the last\nall came to this, Sylleus was sent away to answer Herod's suit, and to\nrepay the debt that he owed, and after that to be punished [with death].\nBut still Caesar was offended with Aretas, that he had taken upon himself\nthe government, without his consent first obtained, for he had determined\nto bestow Arabia upon Herod; but that the letters he had sent hindered\nhim from so doing; for Olympus and Volumnius, perceiving that Caesar was\nnow become favorable to Herod, thought fit immediately to deliver him the\nletters they were commanded by Herod to give him concerning his sons. When\nCaesar had read them, he thought it would not be proper to add another\ngovernment to him, now he was old, and in an ill state with relation to\nhis sons, so he admitted Aretas's ambassadors; and after he had just reproved\nhim for his rashness, in not tarrying till he received the kingdom from\nhim, he accepted of his presents, and confirmed him in his government.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "What Josephus relates Augustus to have here said, that Berytus was a city\nbelonging to the Romans, is confirmed by Spanheim's notes here: \"It\nwas,\" says he, \"a colony placed there by Augustus. Whence Ulpian,\nDe Gens. bel. L. T. XV. The colony of Berytus was rendered famous by the\nbenefits of Caesar; and thence it is that, among the coins of Augustus,\nwe meet with some having this inscription: The happy colony of Augustus\nat Berytua\""}, "#text": "SO Caesar was now reconciled to Herod, and wrote thus to him: That\nhe was grieved for him on account of his sons; and that in case they had\nbeen guilty of any profane and insolent crimes against him, it would behoove\nhim to punish them as parricides, for which he gave him power accordingly;\nbut if they had only contrived to fly away, he would have him give them\nan admonition, and not proceed to extremity with them. He also advised\nhim to get an assembly together, and to appoint some place near Berytus,\n\nwhich is a city belonging to the Romans, and to take the presidents of\nSyria, and Archelaus king of Cappadocia, and as many more as he thought\nto be illustrious for their friendship to him, and the dignities they were\nin, and determine what should be done by their approbation. These were\nthe directions that Caesar gave him. Accordingly Herod, when the letter\nwas brought to him, was immediately very glad of Caesar's reconciliation\nto him, and very glad also that he had a complete authority given him over\nhis sons. And it strangely came about, that whereas before, in his adversity,\nthough he had indeed showed himself severe, yet had he not been very rash\nnor hasty in procuring the destruction of his sons; he now, in his prosperity,\ntook advantage of this change for the better, and the freedom he now had,\nto exercise his hatred against them after an unheard of manner; he therefore\nsent and called as many as he thought fit to this assembly, excepting Archclaus;\nfor as for him, he either hated him, so that he would not invite him, or\nhe thought he would be an obstacle to his designs."}, "When the presidents, and the rest that belonged to the cities, were\ncome to Berytus, he kept his sons in a certain village belonging to Sidon,\ncalled Platana, but near to this city, that if they were called, he might\nproduce them, for he did not think fit to bring them before the assembly:\nand when there were one hundred and fifty assessors present, Herod came\nby himself alone, and accused his sons, and that in such a way as if it\nwere not a melancholy accusation, and not made but out of necessity, and\nupon the misfortunes he was under; indeed, in such a way as was very indecent\nfor a father to accuse his sons, for he was very vehement and disordered\nwhen he came to the demonstration of the crime they were accused of, and\ngave the greatest signs of passion and barbarity: nor would he suffer the\nassessors to consider of the weight of the evidence, but asserted them\nto be true by his own authority, after a manner most indecent in a father\nagainst his sons, and read himself what they themselves had written, wherein\nthere was no confession of any plots or contrivances against him, but only\nhow they had contrived to fly away, and containing withal certain reproaches\nagainst him, on account of the ill-will he bare them; and when he came\nto those reproaches, he cried out most of all, and exaggerated what they\nsaid, as if they had confessed the design against him, and took his oath\nthat he had rather lose his life than hear such reproachful words. At last\nhe said that he had sufficient authority, both by nature and by Caesar's\ngrant to him, [to do what he thought fit]. He also added an allegation\nof a law of their country, which enjoined this: That if parents laid their\nhands on the head of him that was accused, the standers by were obliged\nto cast stones at him, and thereby to slay him; which though he were ready\nto do in his own country and kingdom, yet did he wait for their determination;\nand yet they came thither not so much as judges, to condemn them for such\nmanifest designs against him, whereby he had almost perished by his sons'\nmeans, but as persons that had an opportunity of showing their detestation\nof such practices, and declaring how unworthy a thing it must be in any,\neven the most remote, to pass over such treacherous designs [without punishment].", "When the king had said this, and the young men had not been produced\nto make any defense for themselves, the assessors perceived there was no\nroom for equity and reconciliation, so they confirmed his authority. And\nin the first place, Saturninus, a person that had been consul, and one\nof great dignity, pronounced his sentence, but with great moderation and\ntrouble; and said that he condemned Herod's sons, but did not think they\nshould be put to death. He had sons of his own, and to put one's son to\ndeath is a greater misfortune than any other that could befall him by their\nmeans. After him Saturninus's sons, for he had three sons that followed\nhim, and were his legates, pronounced the same sentence with their father.\nOn the contrary, Volumnius's sentence was to inflict death on such as had\nbeen so impiously undutiful to their father; and the greatest part of the\nrest said the same, insomuch that the conclusion seemed to be, that the\nyoung men were condemned to die. Immediately after this Herod came away\nfrom thence, and took his sons to Tyre, where Nicolaus met him in his voyage\nfrom Rome; of whom he inquired, after he had related to him what had passed\nat Berytus, what his sentiments were about his sons, and what his friends\nat Rome thought of that matter. His answer was, \"That what they had\ndetermined to do to thee was impious, and that thou oughtest to keep them\nin prison; and if thou thinkest any thing further necessary, thou mayst\nindeed so punish them, that thou mayst not appear to indulge thy anger\nmore than to govern thyself by judgment; but if thou inclinest to the milder\nside, thou mayst absolve them, lest perhaps thy misfortunes be rendered\nincurable; and this is the opinion of the greatest part of thy friends\nat Rome also.\" Whereupon Herod was silent, and in great thoughtfulness,\nand bid Nicolaus sail along with him.", "Now as they came to Cesarea, every body was there talking of Herod's\nsons, and the kingdom was in suspense, and the people in great expectation\nof what would become of them; for a terrible fear seized upon all men,\nlest the ancient disorders of the family should come to a sad conclusion,\nand they were in great trouble about their sufferings; nor was it without\ndanger to say any rash thing about this matter, nor even to hear another\nsaying it, but men's pity was forced to be shut up in themselves, which\nrendered the excess of their sorrow very irksome, but very silent yet was\nthere an old soldier of Herod's, whose name was Tero, who had a son of\nthe same age with Alexander, and his friend, who was so very free as openly\nto speak out what others silently thought about that matter; and was forced\nto cry out often among the multitude, and said, in the most unguarded manner,\nthat truth was perished, and justice taken away from men, while lies and\nill-will prevailed, and brought such a mist before public affairs, that\nthe offenders were not able to see the greatest mischiefs that can befall\nmen. And as he was so bold, he seemed not to have kept himself out of danger,\nby speaking so freely; but the reasonableness of what he said moved men\nto regard him as having behaved himself with great manhood, and this at\na proper time also, for which reason every one heard what he said with\npleasure; and although they first took care of their own safety by keeping\nsilent themselves, yet did they kindly receive the great freedom he took;\nfor the expectation they were in of so great an affliction, put a force\nupon them to speak of Tero whatsoever they pleased.", "This man had thrust himself into the king's presence with the greatest\nfreedom, and desired to speak with him by himself alone, which the king\npermitted him to do, where he said this: \"Since I am not able, O king,\nto bear up under so great a concern as I am under, I have preferred the\nuse of this bold liberty that I now take, which may be for thy advantage,\nif thou mind to get any profit by it, before my own safety. Whither is\nthy understanding gone, and left thy soul empty? Whither is that extraordinary\nsagacity of thine gone whereby thou hast performed so many and such glorious-actions?\nWhence comes this solitude, and desertion of thy friends and relations?\nOf which I cannot but determine that they are neither thy friends nor relations,\nwhile they overlook such horrid wickedness in thy once happy kingdom. Dost\nnot thou perceive what is doing? Wilt thou slay these two young men, born\nof thy queen, who are accomplished with every virtue in the highest degree,\nand leave thyself destitute in thy old age, but exposed to one son, who\nhath very ill managed the hopes thou hast given him,' and to relations,\nwhose death thou hast so often resolved on thyself? Dost not thou take\nnotice, that the very silence of the multitude at once sees the crime,\nand abhors the fact? The whole army and the officers have commiseration\non the poor unhappy youths, and hatred to those that are the actors in\nthis matter.\" These words the king heard, and for some time with good\ntemper. But what can one say? When Tero plainly touched upon the bad behavior\nand perfidiousness of his domestics, he was moved at it; but Tero went\non further, and by degrees used an unbounded military freedom of speech,\nnor was he so well disciplined as to accommodate himself to the time. So\nHerod was greatly disturbed, and seeming to be rather reproached by this\nspeech, than to be hearing what was for his advantage, while he learned\nthereby that both the soldiers abhorred the thing he was about, and the\nofficers had indignation at it, he gave order that all whom Tero had named,\nand Tero himself, should be bound and kept in prison.", "When this was over, one Trypho, who was the king's barber, took the\nopportunity, and came and told the king, that Tero would often have persuaded\nhim, when he trimmed him with a razor, to cut his throat, for that by this\nmeans he should be among the chief of Alexander's friends, and receive\ngreat rewards from him. When he had said this, the king gave order that\nTero, and his son, and the barber should be tortured, which was done accordingly;\nbut while Tero bore up himself, his son seeing his father already in a\nsad case, and had no hope of deliverance, and perceiving what would be\nthe consequence of his terrible sufferings, said, that if the king would\nfree him and his father from these torments for what he should say, he\nwould tell the truth. And when the king had given his word to do so, he\nsaid that there was an agreement made, that Tero should lay violent hands\non the king, because it was easy for him to come when he was alone; and\nthat if, when he had done the thing, he should suffer death for it, as\nwas not unlikely, it would be an act of generosity done in favor of Alexander.\nThis was what Tero's son said, and thereby freed his father from the distress\nhe was in; but uncertain it is whether he had been thus forced to speak\nwhat was true, or whether it were a contrivance of his, in order to procure\nhis own and his father's deliverance from their miseries.", "As for Herod, if he had before any doubt about the slaughter of his\nsons, there was now no longer any room left in his soul for it; but he\nhad banished away whatsoever might afford him the least suggestion of reasoning\nbetter about this matter, so he already made haste to bring his purpose\nto a conclusion. He also brought out three hundred of the officers that\nwere under an accusation, as also Tero and his son, and the barber that\naccused them before an assembly, and brought an accusation against them\nall; whom the multitude stoned with whatsoever came to hand, and thereby\nslew them. Alexander also and Aristobulus were brought to Sebaste, by their\nfather's command, and there strangled; but their dead bodies were in the\nnight time carried to Alexandraum, where their uncle by the mother's side,\nand the greatest part of their ancestors, had been deposited.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The reader is here to note, that this eighth section is entirely wanting\nin the old Latin version, as Spanheim truly observes; nor is there any\nother reason for it, I suppose, than the great difficulty of an exact translation."}, "#text": "And now perhaps it may not seem unreasonable to some, that such an inveterate\nhatred might increase so much [on both sides], as to proceed further, and\novercome nature; but it may justly deserve consideration, whether it be\nto be laid to the charge of the young men, that they gave such an occasion\nto their father's anger, and led him to do what he did, and by going on\nlong in the same way put things past remedy, and brought him to use them\nso unmercifully; or whether it be to be laid to the father's charge, that\nhe was so hard-hearted, and so very tender in the desire of government,\nand of other things that would tend to his glory, that tae would take no\none into a partnership with him, that so whatsoever he would have done\nhimself might continue immovable; or, indeed, whether fortune have not\ngreater power than all prudent reasonings; whence we are persuaded that\nhuman actions are thereby determined beforehand by an inevitable necessity,\nand we call her Fate, because there is nothing which is not done by her;\nwherefore I suppose it will be sufficient to compare this notion with that\nother, which attribute somewhat to ourselves, and renders men not unaccountable\nfor the different conducts of their lives, which notion is no other than\nthe philosophical determination of our ancient law. Accordingly, of the\ntwo other causes of this sad event, any body may lay the blame on the young\nmen, who acted by youthful vanity, and pride of their royal birth, that\nthey should bear to hear the calumnies that were raised against their father,\nwhile certainly they were not equitable judges of the actions of his life,\nbut ill-natured in suspecting, and intemperate in speaking of it, and on\nboth accounts easily caught by those that observed them, and revealed them\nto gain favor; yet cannot their father be thought worthy excuse, as to\nthat horrid impiety which he was guilty of about them, while he ventured,\nwithout any certain evidence of their treacherous designs against him,\nand without any proofs that they had made preparations for such attempt,\nto kill his own sons, who were of very comely bodies, and the great darlings\nof other men, and no way deficient in their conduct, whether it were in\nhunting, or in warlike exercises, or in speaking upon occasional topics\nof discourse; for in all these they were skillful, and especially Alexander,\nwho was the eldest; for certainly it had been sufficient, even though he\nhad condemned them, to have kept them alive in bonds, or to let them live\nat a distance from his dominions in banishment, while he was surrounded\nby the Roman forces, which were a strong security to him, whose help would\nprevent his suffering any thing by a sudden onset, or by open force; but\nfor him to kill them on the sudden, in order to gratify a passion that\ngoverned him, was a demonstration of insufferable impiety. He also was\nguilty of so great a crime in his older age; nor will the delays that he\nmade, and the length of time in which the thing was done, plead at all\nfor his excuse; for when a man is on a sudden amazed, and in commotion\nof mind, and then commits a wicked action, although this be a heavy crime,\nyet is it a thing that frequently happens; but to do it upon deliberation,\nand after frequent attempts, and as frequent puttings-off, to undertake\nit at last, and accomplish it, was the action of a murderous mind, and\nsuch as was not easily moved from that which is evil. And this temper he\nshowed in what he did afterward, when he did not spare those that seemed\nto be the best beloved of his friends that were left, wherein, though the\njustice of the punishment caused those that perished to be the less pitied,\nyet was the barbarity of the man here equal, in that he did not abstain\nfrom their slaughter also.

taken off his brethren, and had brought his\nfather into the highest degree of impiety, till he was haunted with furies\nfor what he had done, his hopes did not succeed to his mind, as to the\nrest of his life; for although he was delivered from the fear of his brethren\nbeing his rivals as to the government, yet did he find it a very hard thing,\nand almost impracticable, to come at the kingdom, because the hatred of\nthe nation against him on that account was become very great; and besides\nthis very disagreeable circumstance, the affair of the soldiery grieved\nhim still more, who were alienated from him, from which yet these kings\nderived all the safety which they had, whenever they found the nation desirous\nof innovation: and all this danger was drawn upon him by his destruction\nof his brethren. However, he governed the nation jointly with his father,\nbeing indeed no other than a king already; and he was for that very reason\ntrusted, and the more firmly depended on, for the which he ought himself\nto have been put to death, as appearing to have betrayed his brethren out\nof his concern for the preservation of Herod, and not rather out of his\nill-will to them, and, before them, to his father himself: and this was\nthe accursed state he was in. Now all Antipater's contrivances tended to\nmake his way to take off Herod, that he might have nobody to accuse him\nin the vile practices he was devising: and that Herod might have no refuge,\nnor any to afford him their assistance, since they must thereby have Antipater\nfor their open enemy; insomuch that the very plots he had laid against\nhis brethren were occasioned by the hatred he bore his father. But at this\ntime he was more than ever set upon the execution of his attempts against\nHerod, because if he were once dead, the government would now be firmly\nsecured to him; but if he were suffered to live any longer, he should be\nin danger, upon a discovery of that wickedness of which he had been the\ncontriver, and his father would of necessity then become his enemy. And\non this account it was that he became very bountiful to his father's friends,\nand bestowed great sums on several of them, in order to surprise men with\nhis good deeds, and take off their hatred against him. And he sent great\npresents to his friends at Rome particularly, to gain their good-will;\nand above all to Saturninus, the president of Syria. He also hoped to gain\nthe favor of Saturninus's brother with the large presents he bestowed on\nhim; as also he used the same art to [Salome] the king's sister, who had\nmarried one of Herod's chief friends. And when he counterfeited friendship\nto those with whom he conversed, he was very subtle in gaining their belief,\nand very cunning to hide his hatred against any that he really did hate.\nBut he could not impose upon his aunt, who understood him of a long time,\nand was a woman not easily to be deluded, especially while she had already\nused all possible caution in preventing his pernicious designs. Although\nAntipeter's uncle by the mother's side was married to her daughter, and\nthis by his own connivance and management, while she had before been married\nto Aristobulus, and while Salome's other daughter by that husband was married\nto the son of Calleas; yet that marriage was no obstacle to her, who knew\nhow wicked he was, in her discovering his designs, as her former kindred\nto him could not prevent her hatred of him. Now Herod had compelled Salome,\nwhile she was in love with Sylleus the Arabian, and had taken a fondness\nfor him, to marry Alexas; which match was by her submitted to at the instance\nof Julia, who persuaded Salome not to refuse it, lest she should herself\nbe their open enemy, since Herod had sworn that he would never be friends\nwith Salome, if she would not accept of Alexas for her husband; so she\nsubmitted to Julia as being Caesar's wife; and besides that, she advised\nher to nothing but what was very much for her own advantage. At this time\nalso it was that Herod sent back king Archelaus's daughter, who had been\nAlexander's wife, to her father, returning the portion he had with her\nout of his own estate, that there might be no dispute between them about\nit.", "Now Herod brought up his sons' children with great care; for Alexander\nhad two sons by Glaphyra; and Aristobulus had three sons by Bernice, Salome's\ndaughter, and two daughters; and as his friends were once with him, he\npresented the children before them; and deploring the hard fortune of his\nown sons, he prayed that no such ill fortune would befall these who were\ntheir children, but that they might improve in virtue, and obtain what\nthey justly deserved, and might make him amends for his care of their education.\nHe also caused them to be betrothed against they should come to the proper\nage of marriage; the elder of Alexander's sons to Pheroras's daughter,\nand Antipater's daughter to Aristobulus's eldest son. He also allotted\none of Aristobulus's daughters to Antipater's son, and Aristobulus's other\ndaughter to Herod, a son of his own, who was born to him by the high priest's\ndaughter; for it is the ancient practice among us to have many wives at\nthe same time. Now the king made these espousals for the children, out\nof commiseration of them now they were fatherless, as endeavoring to render\nAntipater kind to them by these intermarriages. But Antipater did not fail\nto bear the same temper of mind to his brothers' children which he had\nborne to his brothers themselves; and his father's concern about them provoked\nhis indignation against them upon this supposal, that they would become\ngreater than ever his brothers had been; while Archclaus, a king, would\nsupport his daughter's sons, and Pheroras, a tetrarch, would accept of\none of the daughters as a wife to his son. What provoked him also was this,\nthat all the multitude would so commiserate these fatherless children,\nand so hate him [for making them fatherless], that all would come out,\nsince they were no strangers to his vile disposition towards his brethren.\nHe contrived, therefore, to overturn his father's settlements, as thinking\nit a terrible thing that they should be so related to him, and be so powerful\nwithal. So Herod yielded to him, and changed his resolution at his entreaty;\nand the determination now was, that Antipater himself should marry Aristobulus's\ndaughter, and Antipater's son should marry Pheroras's daughter.

One of his wives also was of the Samaritan\nnation, whose sons were Antipas and Archelaus, and whose daughter was Olympias;\nwhich daughter was afterward married to Joseph, the king's brother's son;\nbut Archelaus and Antipas were brought up with a certain private man at\nRome. Herod had also to wife Cleopatra of Jerusalem, and by her he had\nhis sons Herod and Philip; which last was also brought up at Rome.

Accordingly, when he understood\nthat there was a man that was a Jew come out of Babylon, with five hundred\nhorsemen, all of whom could shoot their arrows as they rode on horde-back,\nand, with a hundred of his relations, had passed over Euphrates, and now\nabode at Antioch by Daphne of Syria, where Saturninus, who was then president,\nhad given them a place for habitation, called Valatha, he sent for this\nman, with the multitude that followed him, and promised to give him land\nin the toparchy called Batanea, which country is bounded with Trachonitis,\nas desirous to make that his habitation a guard to himself.

This continued during\nthe life of Herod; but when Philip, who was [tetrarch] after him, took\nthe government, he made them pay some small taxes, and that for a little\nwhile only; and Agrippa the Great, and his son of the same name, although\nthey harassed them greatly, yet would they not take their liberty away.\nFrom whom, when the Romans have now taken the government into their own\nhands, they still gave them the privilege of their freedom, but oppress\nthem entirely with the imposition of taxes. Of which matter I shall treat\nmore accurately in the progress of this history."}, "At length Zamaris the Babylonian, to whom Herod had given that country\nfor a possession, died, having lived virtuously, and left children of a\ngood character behind him; one of whom was Jacim, who was famous for his\nvalor, and taught his Babylonians how to ride their horses; and a troop\nof them were guards to the forementioned kings.

He was also formidable to all, not so much on account of the power\nand authority he had, as for the shrewdness of his vile attempts beforehand;\nbut he who principally cultivated a friendship with him was Pheroras, who\nreceived the like marks of his friendship; while Antipater had cunningly\nencompassed him about by a company of women, whom he placed as guards about\nhim; for Pheroras was greatly enslaved to his wife, and to her mother,\nand to her sister; and this notwithstanding the hatred he bare them for\nthe indignities they had offered to his virgin daughters.

And since these people knew that their friendship was very disagreeable\nto Herod, as tending to do him a mischief, they contrived that their meetings\nshould not be discovered; so they pretended to hate one another, and to\nabuse one another when time served, and especially when Herod was present,\nor when any one was there that would tell him: but still their intimacy\nwas firmer than ever, when they were private. And this was the course they\ntook. But they could not conceal from Salome neither their first contrivance,\nwhen they set about these their intentions, nor when they had made some\nprogress in them; but she searched out every thing; and, aggravating the\nrelations to her brother, declared to him, as well their secret assemblies\nand compotations, as their counsels taken in a clandestine manner, which\nif they were not in order to destroy him, they might well enough have been\nopen and public. But to appearance they are at variance, and speak about\none another as if they intended one another a mischief, but agree so well\ntogether when they are out of the sight of the multitude; for when they\nare alone by themselves, they act in concert, and profess that they will\nnever leave off their friendship, but will fight against those from whom\nthey conceal their designs. And thus did she search out these things, and\nget a perfect knowledge of them, and then told her brother of them, who\nunderstood also of himself a great deal of what she said, but still durst\nnot depend upon it, because of the suspicions he had of his sister's calumnies.\nFor there was a certain sect of men that were Jews, who valued themselves\nhighly upon the exact skill they had in the law of their fathers, and made\nmen believe they were highly favored by God, by whom this set of women\nwere inveigled. These are those that are called the sect of the Pharisees,\nwho were in a capacity of greatly opposing kings. A cunning sect they were,\nand soon elevated to a pitch of open fighting and doing mischief. Accordingly,\nwhen all the people of the Jews gave assurance of their good-will to Caesar,\nand to the king's government, these very men did not swear, being above\nsix thousand; and when the king imposed a fine upon them, Pheroras's wife\npaid their fine for them. In order to requite which kindness of hers, since\nthey were believed to have the foreknowledge of things to come by Divine\ninspiration, they foretold how God had decreed that Herod's government\nshould cease, and his posterity should be deprived of it; but that the\nkingdom should come to her and Pheroras, and to their children. These predictions\nwere not concealed from Salome, but were told the king; as also how they\nhad perverted some persons about the palace itself; so the king slew such\nof the Pharisees as were principally accused, and Bagoas the eunuch, and\none Carus, who exceeded all men of that time in comeliness, and one that\nwas his catamite. He slew also all those of his own family who had consented\nto what the Pharisees foretold; and for Bagoas, he had been puffed up by\nthem, as though he should be named the father and the benefactor of him\nwho, by the prediction, was foretold to be their appointed king; for that\nthis king would have all things in his power, and would enable Bagoas to\nmarry, and to have children of his own body begotten."}, "WHEN Herod had punished those Pharisees who had been convicted of\nthe foregoing crimes, he gathered an assembly together of his friends,\nand accused Pheroras's wife; and ascribing the abuses of the virgins to\nthe impudence of that woman, brought an accusation against her for the\ndishonor she had brought upon them: that she had studiously introduced\na quarrel between him and his brother, and, by her ill temper, had brought\nthem into a state of war, both by her words and actions; that the fines\nwhich he had laid had not been paid, and the offenders had escaped punishment\nby her means; and that nothing which had of late been done had been done\nwithout her; \"for which reason Pheroras would do well, if he would\nof his own accord, and by his own command, and not at my entreaty, or as\nfollowing my opinion, put this his wife away, as one that will still be\nthe occasion of war between thee and me. And now, Pheroras, if thou valuest\nthy relation to me, put this wife of thine away; for by this means thou\nwilt continue to be a brother to me, and wilt abide in thy love to me.\"\nThen said Pheroras, (although he was pressed hard by the former words,)\nthat as he would not do so unjust a thing as to renounce his brotherly\nrelation to him, so would he not leave off his affection for his wife;\nthat he would rather choose to die than to live, and be deprived of a wife\nthat was so dear unto him. Hereupon Herod put off his anger against Pheroras\non these accounts, although he himself thereby underwent a very uneasy\npunishment. However, he forbade Antipater and his mother to have any conversation\nwith Pheroras, and bid them to take care to avoid the assemblies of the\nwomen; which they promised to do, but still got together when occasion\nserved, and both Ptieroras and Antipater had their own merry meetings.\nThe report went also, that Antipater had criminal conversation with Pheroras's\nwife, and that they were brought together by Antipater's mother.", "But Antipater had now a suspicion of his father, and was afraid that\nthe effects of his hatred to him might increase; so he wrote to his friends\nat Rome, and bid them to send to Herod, that he would immediately send\nAntipater to Caesar; which when it was done, Herod sent Antipater thither,\nand sent most noble presents along with him; as also his testament, wherein\nAntipater was appointed to be his successor; and that if Antipater should\ndie first, his son [Herod Philip] by the high priest's daughter should\nsucceed. And, together with Antipater, there went to Rome Sylleus the Arabian,\nalthough he had done nothing of all that Caesar had enjoined him. Antipater\nalso accused him of the same crimes of which he had been formerly accused\nby Herod. Sylleus was also accused by Aretas, that without his consent\nhe had slain many of the chief of the Arabians at Petra; and particularly\nSoemus, a man that deserved to be honored by all men; and that he had slain\nFabatus, a servant of Caesar. These were the things of which Sylleus was\naccused, and that on the occasion following: There was one Corinthus, belonging\nto Herod, of the guards of the king's body, and one who was greatly trusted\nby him. Sylleus had persuaded this man with the offer of a great sum of\nmoney to kill Herod; and he had promised to do it. When Fabatus had been\nmade acquainted with this, for Sylleus had himself told him of it, he informed\nthe king of it; who caught Corinthus, and put him to the torture, and thereby\ngot out of him the whole conspiracy. He also caught two other Arabians,\nwho were discovered by Corinthus; the one the head of a tribe, and the\nother a friend to Sylleus, who both were by the king brought to the torture,\nand confessed that they were come to encourage Corinthus not to fail of\ndoing what he had undertaken to do; and to assist him with their own hands\nin the murder, if need should require their assistance. So Saturninns,\nupon Herod's discovering the whole to him, sent them to Rome.", "At this time Herod commanded Pheroras, that since he was so obstinate\nin his affection for his wife, he should retire into his own tetrarchy;\nwhich he did very willingly, and sware many oaths that he would not come\nagain till he heard that Herod was dead. And indeed when, upon a sickness\nof the king, he was desired to come to him before he died, that he might\nintrust him with some of his injunctions, he had such a regard to his oath,\nthat he would not come to him; yet did not Herod so retain his hatred to\nPheroras, but remitted of his purpose [not to see him], which he before\nhad, and that for such great causes as have been already mentioned: but\nas soon as he began to be ill, he came to him, and this without being sent\nfor; and when he was dead, he took care of his funeral, and had his body\nbrought to Jerusalem, and buried there, and appointed a solemn mourning\nfor him. This [death of Pheroras] became the origin of Antipater's misfortunes,\nalthough he were already sailed for Rome, God now being about to punish\nhim for the murder of his brethren, I will explain the history of this\nmatter very distinctly, that it may be for a warning to mankind, that they\ntake care of conducting their whole lives by the rules of virtue.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "His\nwife, her mother, and sister."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "It seems to me, by this whole story put together, that Pheroras was not\nhimself poisoned, as is commonly supposed; for Antipater had persuaded\nhim to poison Herod, ch. v. sect. 1, which would fall to the ground if\nhe wore himself poisoned; nor could the poisoning of Pheroras serve any\ndesign that appears now going forward; it was only the supposal of two\nof his freed-men, that this love-potion, or poison, which they knew was\nbrought to Pheroras's wife, was made use of for poisoning him; whereas\nit appears to have been brought for her husband to poison Herod withal,\nas the future examinations demonstrate."}], "#text": "AS soon as Pheroras was dead, and his funeral was over, two of Pheroras's\nfreed-men, who were much esteemed by him, came to Herod, and entreated\nhim not to leave the murder of his brother without avenging it, but to\nexamine into such an unreasonable and unhappy death. When he was moved\nwith these words, for they seemed to him to be true, they said that Pheroras\nsupped with his wife the day before he fell sick, and that a certain potion\nwas brought him in such a sort of food as he was not used to eat; but that\nwhen he had eaten, he died of it: that this potion was brought out of Arabia\nby a woman, under pretense indeed as a love-potion, for that was its name,\nbut in reality to kill Pheroras; for that the Arabian women are skillful\nin making such poisons: and the woman to whom they ascribe this was confessedly\na most intimate friend of one of Sylleus's mistresses; and that both the\nmother and the sister of Pheroras's wife had been at the places where she\nlived, and had persuaded her to sell them this potion, and had come back\nand brought it with them the day before that his supper. Hereupon the king\nwas provoked, and put the women slaves to the torture, and some that were\nfree with them; and as the fact did not yet appear, because none of them\nwould confess it, at length one of them, under the utmost agonies, said\nno more but this, that she prayed that God would send the like agonies\nupon Antipater's mother, who had been the occasion of these miseries to\nall of them. This prayer induced Herod to increase the women's tortures,\ntill thereby all was discovered; their merry meetings, their secret assemblies,\nand the disclosing of what he had said to his son alone unto Pheroras's\n women.\n(Now what Herod had charged Antipater to conceal, was the gift of a hundred\ntalents to him not to have any conversation with Pheroras.) And what hatred\nhe bore to his father; and that he complained to his mother how very long\nhis father lived; and that he was himself almost an old man, insomuch that\nif the kingdom should come to him, it would not afford him any great pleasure;\nand that there were a great many of his brothers, or brothers' children,\nbringing up, that might have hopes of the kingdom as well as himself, all\nwhich made his own hopes of it uncertain; for that even now, if he should\nhimself not live, Herod had ordained that the government should be conferred,\nnot on his son, but rather on a brother. He also had accused the king of\ngreat barbarity, and of the slaughter of his sons; and that it was out\nof the fear he was under, lest he should do the like to him, that made\nhim contrive this his journey to Rome, and Pheroras contrive to go to his\nown tetrarchy."}, "These confessions agreed with what his sister had told him, and tended\ngreatly to corroborate her testimony, and to free her from the suspicion\nof her unfaithfulness to him. So the king having satisfied himself of the\nspite which Doris, Antipater's mother, as well as himself, bore to him,\ntook away from her all her fine ornaments, which were worth many talents,\nand then sent her away, and entered into friendship with Pheroras's women.\nBut he who most of all irritated the king against his son was one Antipater,\nthe procurator of Antipater the king's son, who, when he was tortured,\namong other things, said that Antipater had prepared a deadly potion, and\ngiven it to Pheroras, with his desire that he would give it to his father\nduring his absence, and when he was too remote to have the least suspicion\ncast upon him thereto relating; that Antiphilus, one of Antipater's friends,\nbrought that potion out of Egypt; and that it was sent to Pheroras by Thendion,\nthe brother of the mother of Antipater, the king's son, and by that means\ncame to Pheroras's wife, her husband having given it her to keep. And when\nthe king asked her about it, she confessed it; and as she was running to\nfetch it, she threw herself down from the house-top; yet did she not kill\nherself, because she fell upon her feet; by which means, when the king\nhad comforted her, and had promised her and her domestics pardon, upon\ncondition of their concealing nothing of the truth from him, but had threatened\nher with the utmost miseries if she proved ungrateful [and concealed any\nthing]: so she promised, and swore that she would speak out every thing,\nand tell after what manner every thing was done; and said what many took\nto be entirely true, that the potion was brought out of Egypt by Antiphilus;\nand that his brother, who was a physician, had procured it; and that\nwhen Thendion brought it us, she kept it upon Pheroras's committing it\nto her; and that it was prepared by Antipater for thee. When, therefore,\nPheroras was fallen sick, and thou camest to him and tookest care of him,\nand when he saw the kindness thou hadst for him, his mind was overborne\nthereby. So he called me to him, and said to me, \"O woman! Antipater hath\ncircumvented me in this affair of his father and my brother, by persuading\nme to have a murderous intention to him, and procuring a potion to be subservient\nthereto; do thou, therefore, go and fetch my potion, (since my brother\nappears to have still the same virtuous disposition towards me which he\nhad formerly, and I do not expect to live long myself, and that I may not\ndefile my forefathers by the murder of a brother,) and burn it before my\nface:' that accordingly she immediately brought it, and did as her husband\nbade her; and that she burnt the greatest part of the potion; but that\na little of it was left, that if the king, after Pheroras's death, should\ntreat her ill, she might poison herself, and thereby get clear of her miseries.\"\nUpon her saying thus, she brought out the potion, and the box in which\nit was, before them all. Nay, there was another brother of Antiphilus,\nand his mother also, who, by the extremity of pain and torture, confessed\nthe same things, and owned the box [to be that which had been brought out\nof Egypt]. The high priest's daughter also, who was the king's wife, was\naccused to have been conscious of all this, and had resolved to conceal\nit; for which reason Herod divorced her, and blotted her son out of his\ntestament, wherein he had been mentioned as one that was to reign after\nhim; and he took the high priesthood away from his father-in-law, Simeon\nthe son of Boethus, and appointed Matthias the son of Theophilus, who was\nborn at Jerusalem, to be high priest in his room.", "While this was doing, Bathyllus also, Antipater's freed-man, came\nfrom Rome, and, upon the torture, was found to have brought another potion,\nto give it into the hands of Antipater's mother, and of Pheroras, that\nif the former potion did not operate upon the king, this at least might\ncarry him off. There came also letters from Herod's friends at Rome, by\nthe approbation and at the suggestion of Antipater, to accuse Archelaus\nand Philip, as if they calumniated their father on account of the slaughter\nof Alexander and Aristobulus, and as if they commiserated their deaths,\nand as if, because they were sent for home, (for their father had already\nrecalled them,) they concluded they were themselves also to be destroyed.\nThese letters had been procured by great rewards by Antipater's friends;\nbut Antipater himself wrote to his father about them, and laid the heaviest\nthings to their charge; yet did he entirely excuse them of any guilt, and\nsaid they were but young men, and so imputed their words to their youth.\nBut he said that he had himself been very busy in the affair relating to\nSylleus, and in getting interest among the great men; and on that account\nhad bought splendid ornaments to present them withal, which cost him two\nhundred talents. Now one may wonder how it came about, that while so many\naccusations were laid against him in Judea during seven months before this\ntime, he was not made acquainted with any of them. The causes of which\nwere, that the roads were exactly guarded, and that men hated Antipater;\nfor there was nobody who would run any hazard himself to gain him any advantages.", "NOW Herod, upon Antipater's writing to him, that having done all\nthat he was to do, and this in the manner he was to do it, he would suddenly\ncome to him, concealed his anger against him, and wrote back to him, and\nbid him not delay his journey, lest any harm should befall himself in his\nabsence. At the same time also he made some little complaint about his\nmother, but promised that he would lay those complaints aside when he should\nreturn. He withal expressed his entire affection for him, as fearing lest\nhe should have some suspicion of him, and defer his journey to him; and\nlest, while he lived at Rome, he should lay plots for the kingdom, and,\nmoreover, do somewhat against himself. This letter Antipater met with in\nCilicia; but had received an account of Pheroras's death before at Tarentum.\nThis last news affected him deeply; not out of any affection for Pheroras,\nbut because he was dead without having murdered his father, which he had\npromised him to do. And when he was at Celenderis in Cilicia, he began\nto deliberate with himself about his sailing home, as being much grieved\nwith the ejection of his mother. Now some of his friends advised him that\nhe should tarry a while some where, in expectation of further information.\nBut others advised him to sail home without delay; for that if he were\nonce come thither, he would soon put an end to all accusations, and that\nnothing afforded any weight to his accusers at present but his absence.\nHe was persuaded by these last, and sailed on, and landed at the haven\ncalled Sebastus, which Herod had built at vast expenses in honor of Caesar,\nand called Sebastus. And now was Antipater evidently in a miserable condition,\nwhile nobody came to him nor saluted him, as they did at his going away,\nwith good wishes of joyful acclamations; nor was there now any thing to\nhinder them from entertaining him, on the contrary, with bitter curses,\nwhile they supposed he was come to receive his punishment for the murder\nof his brethren.", "Now Quintilius Varus was at this time at Jerusalem, being sent to\nsucceed Saturninus as president of Syria, and was come as an assessor to\nHerod, who had desired his advice in his present affairs; and as they were\nsitting together, Antipater came upon them, without knowing any thing of\nthe matter; so he came into the palace clothed in purple. The porters indeed\nreceived him in, but excluded his friends. And now he was in great disorder,\nand presently understood the condition he was in, while, upon his going\nto salute his father, he was repulsed by him, who called him a murderer\nof his brethren, and a plotter of destruction against himself, and told\nhim that Varus should be his auditor and his judge the very next day; so\nhe found that what misfortunes he now heard of were already upon him, with\nthe greatness of which he went away in confusion; upon which his mother\nand his wife met him, (which wife was the daughter of Antigonus, who was\nking of the Jews before Herod,) from whom he learned all circumstances\nwhich concerned him, and then prepared himself for his trial.", "On the next day Varus and the king sat together in judgment, and\nboth their friends were also called in, as also the king's relations, with\nhis sister Salome, and as many as could discover any thing, and such as\nhad been tortured; and besides these, some slaves of Antipater's mother,\nwho were taken up a little before Antipater's coming, and brought with\nthem a written letter, the sum of which was this: That he should not come\nback, because all was come to his father's knowledge; and that Caesar was\nthe only refuge he had left to prevent both his and her delivery into his\nfather's hands. Then did Antipater fall down at his father's feet, and\nbesought him not to prejudge his cause, but that he might be first heard\nby his father, and that his father would keep himself unprejudiced. So\nHerod ordered him to be brought into the midst, and then lamented himself\nabout his children, from whom he had suffered such great misfortunes; and\nbecause Antipater fell upon him in his old age. He also reckoned up what\nmaintenance and what education he had given them; and what seasonable supplies\nof wealth he had afforded them, according to their own desires; none of\nwhich favors had hindered them from contriving against him, and from bringing\nhis very life into danger, in order to gain his kingdom, after an impious\nmanner, by taking away his life before the course of nature, their father's\nwishes, or justice required that that kingdom should come to them; and\nthat he wondered what hopes could elevate Antipater to such a pass as to\nbe hardy enough to attempt such things; that he had by his testament in\nwriting declared him his successor in the government; and while he was\nalive, he was in no respect inferior to him, either in his illustrious\ndignity, or in power and authority, he having no less than fifty talents\nfor his yearly income, and had received for his journey to Rome no fewer\nthan thirty talents. He also objected to him the case of his brethren whom\nhe had accused; and if they were guilty, he had imitated their example;\nand if not, he had brought him groundless accusations against his near\nrelations; for that he had been acquainted with all those things by him,\nand by nobody else, and had done what was done by his approbation, and\nwhom he now absolved from all that was criminal, by becoming the inheritor\nof the guilt of such their parricide.", "When Herod had thus spoken, he fell a weeping, and was not able to\nsay any more; but at his desire Nicolaus of Damascus, being the king's\nfriend, and always conversant with him, and acquainted with whatsoever\nhe did, and with the circumstances of his affairs, proceeded to what remained,\nand explained all that concerned the demonstrations and evidences of the\nfacts. Upon which Antipater, in order to make his legal defense, turned\nhimself to his father, and enlarged upon the many indications he had given\nof his good-will to him; and instanced in the honors that had been done\nhim, which yet had not been done, had he not deserved them by his virtuous\nconcern about him; for that he had made provision for every thing that\nwas fit to be foreseen beforehand, as to giving him his wisest advice;\nand whenever there was occasion for the labor of his own hands, he had\nnot grudged any such pains for him. And that it was almost impossible that\nhe, who had delivered his father from so many treacherous contrivances\nlaid against him, should be himself in a plot against him, and so lose\nall the reputation he had gained for his virtue, by his wickedness which\nsucceeded it; and this while he had nothing to prohibit him, who was already\nappointed his successor, to enjoy the royal honor with his father also\nat present; and that there was no likelihood that a person who had the\none half of that authority without any danger, and with a good character,\nshould hunt after the whole with infamy and danger, and this when it was\ndoubtful whether he could obtain it or not; and when he saw the sad example\nof his brethren before him, and was both the informer and the accuser against\nthem, at a time when they might not otherwise have been discovered; nay,\nwas the author of the punishment inflicted upon them, when it appeared\nevidently that they were guilty of a wicked attempt against their father;\nand that even the contentions there were in the king's family were indications\nthat he had ever managed affairs out of the sincerest affection to his\nfather. And as to what he had done at Rome, Caesar was a witness thereto,\nwho yet was no more to be imposed upon than God himself; of whose opinions\nhis letters sent hither are sufficient evidence; and that it was not reasonable\nto prefer the calumnies of such as proposed to raise disturbances before\nthose letters; the greatest part of which calumnies had been raised during\nhis absence, which gave scope to his enemies to forge them, which they\nhad not been able to do if he had been there. Moreover he showed the weakness\nof the evidence obtained by torture, which was commonly false, because\nthe distress men are in under such tortures naturally obliges them to say\nmany things in order to please those that govern them. He also offered\nhimself to the torture.", "Hereupon there was a change observed in the assembly, while they\ngreatly pitied Antipater, who by weeping and putting on a countenance suitable\nto his sad case made them commiserate the same, insomuch that his very\nenemies were moved to compassion; and it appeared plainly that Herod himself\nwas affected in his own mind, although he was not willing it should be\ntaken notice of. Then did Nicolaus begin to prosecute what the king had\nbegun, and that with great bitterness; and summed up all the evidence which\narose from the tortures, or from the testimonies. He principally and largely\ncried up the king's virtues, which he had exhibited in the maintenance\nand education of his sons; while he never could gain any advantage thereby,\nbut still fell from one misfortune to another. Although he owned that he\nwas not so much surprised with that thoughtless behavior of his former\nsons, who were but young, and were besides corrupted by wicked counselors,\nwho were the occasion of their wiping out of their minds the righteous\ndictates of nature, and this out of a desire of coming to the government\nsooner than they ought to do; yet that he could not but justly stand amazed\nat the horrid wickedness of Antipater, who, although he had not only had\ngreat benefits bestowed on him by his father, enough to tame his reason,\nyet could not be more tamed than the most envenomed serpents; whereas even\nthose creatures admit of some mitigation, and will not bite their benefactors,\nwhile Antipater hath not let the misfortunes of his brethren be any hinderance\nto him, but he hath gone on to imitate their barbarity notwithstanding.\n\"Yet wast thou, O Antipater! (as thou hast thyself confessed,) the\ninformer as to what wicked actions they had done, and the searcher out\nof the evidence against them, and the author of the punishment they underwent\nupon their detection. Nor do we say this as accusing thee for being so\nzealous in thy anger against them, but are astonished at thy endeavors\nto imitate their profligate behavior; and we discover thereby that thou\ndidst not act thus for the safety of thy father, but for the destruction\nof thy brethren, that by such outside hatred of their impiety thou mightest\nbe believed a lover of thy father, and mightest thereby get thee power\nenough to do mischief with the greatest impunity; which design thy actions\nindeed demonstrate. It is true, thou tookest thy brethren off, because\nthou didst convict theft of their wicked designs; but thou didst not yield\nup to justice those who were their partners; and thereby didst make it\nevident to all men that thou madest a covenant with them against thy father,\nwhen thou chosest to be the accuser of thy brethren, as desirous to gain\nto thyself alone this advantage of laying plots to kill thy father, and\nso to enjoy double pleasure, which is truly worthy of thy evil disposition,\nwhich thou has openly showed against thy brethren; on which account thou\ndidst rejoice, as having done a most famous exploit, nor was that behavior\nunworthy of thee. But if thy intention were otherwise, thou art worse than\nthey: while thou didst contrive to hide thy treachery against thy father,\nthou didst hate them, not as plotters against thy father, for in that case\nthou hadst not thyself fallen upon the like crime, but as successors of\nhis dominions, and more worthy of that succession than thyself. Thou wouldst\nkill thy father after thy brethren, lest thy lies raised against them might\nbe detected; and lest thou shouldst suffer what punishment thou hadst deserved,\nthou hadst a mind to exact that punishment of thy unhappy father, and didst\ndevise such a sort of uncommon parricide as the world never yet saw. For\nthou who art his son didst not only lay a treacherous design against thy\nfather, and didst it while he loved thee, and had been thy benefactor,\nhad made thee in reality his partner in the kingdom, and had openly declared\nthee his successor, while thou wast not forbidden to taste the sweetness\nof authority already, and hadst the firm hope of what was future by thy\nfather's determination, and the security of a written testament; but, for\ncertain, thou didst not measure these things according to thy father's\nvarious disposition, but according to thy own thoughts and inclinations;\nand was desirous to take the part that remained away from thy too indulgent\nfather, and soughtest to destroy him with thy deeds, whom thou in words\npretendedst to preserve. Nor wast thou content to be wicked thyself, but\nthou filledst thy mother's head with thy devices, and raised disturbances\namong thy brethren, and hadst the boldness to call thy father a wild beast;\nwhile thou hadst thyself a mind more cruel than any serpent, whence thou\nsentest out that poison among thy nearest kindred and greatest benefactors,\nand invitedst them to assist thee and guard thee, and didst hedge thyself\nin on all sides, by the artifices of both men and women, against an old\nman, as though that mind of thine was not sufficient of itself to support\nso great a hatred as thou baredst to him. And here thou appearest, after\nthe tortures of free-men, of domestics, of men and women, which have been\nexamined on thy account, and after the informations of thy fellow conspirators,\nas making haste to contradict the truth; and hast thought on ways not only\nhow to take thy father out of the world, but to disannul that written law\nwhich is against thee, and the virtue of Varus, and the nature of justice;\nnay, such is that impudence of thine on which thou confidest, that thou\ndesirest to be put to the torture thyself, while thou allegest that the\ntortures of those already examined thereby have made them tell lies; that\nthose that have been the deliverers of thy father may not be allowed to\nhave spoken the truth; but that thy tortures may be esteemed the discoverers\nof truth. Wilt not thou, O Varus! deliver the king from the injuries of\nhis kindred? Wilt not thou destroy this wicked wild beast, which hath pretended\nkindness to his father, in order to destroy his brethren; while yet he\nis himself alone ready to carry off the kingdom immediately, and appears\nto be the most bloody butcher to him of them all? for thou art sensible\nthat parricide is a general injury both to nature and to common life, and\nthat the intention of parricide is not inferior to its perpetration; and\nhe who does not punish it is injurious to nature itself.\"", "Nicolaus added further what belonged to Antipater's mother, and whatsoever\nshe had prattled like a woman; as also about the predictions and the sacrifices\nrelating to the king; and whatsoever Antipater had done lasciviously in\nhis cups and his amours among Pheroras's women; the examination upon torture;\nand whatsoever concerned the testimonies of the witnesses, which were many,\nand of various kinds; some prepared beforehand, and others were sudden\nanswers, which further declared and confirmed the foregoing evidence. For\nthose men who were not acquainted with Antipater's practices, but had concealed\nthem out of fear, when they saw that he was exposed to the accusations\nof the former witnesses, and that his great good fortune, which had supported\nhim hitherto, had now evidently betrayed him into the hands of his enemies,\nwho were now insatiable in their hatred to him, told all they knew of him.\nAnd his ruin was now hastened, not so much by the enmity of those that\nwere his accusers, as by his gross, and impudent, and wicked contrivances,\nand by his ill-will to his father and his brethren; while he had filled\ntheir house with disturbance, and caused them to murder one another; and\nwas neither fair in his hatred, nor kind in his friendship, but just so\nfar as served his own turn. Now there were a great number who for a long\ntime beforehand had seen all this, and especially such as were naturally\ndisposed to judge of matters by the rules of virtue, because they were\nused to determine about affairs without passion, but had been restrained\nfrom making any open complaints before; these, upon the leave now given\nthem, produced all that they knew before the public. The demonstrations\nalso of these wicked facts could no way be disproved, because the many\nwitnesses there were did neither speak out of favor to Herod, nor were\nthey obliged to keep what they had to say silent, out of suspicion of any\ndanger they were in; but they spake what they knew, because they thought\nsuch actions very wicked, and that Antipater deserved the greatest punishment;\nand indeed not so much for Herod's safety, as on account of the man's own\nwickedness. Many things were also said, and those by a great number of\npersons, who were no way obliged to say them, insomuch that Antipater,\nwho used generally to be very shrewd in his lies and impudence, was not\nable to say one word to the contrary. When Nicolaus had left off speaking,\nand had produced the evidence, Varus bid Antipater to betake himself to\nthe making his defense, if he had prepared any thing whereby it might appear\nthat he was not guilty of the crimes he was accused of; for that, as he\nwas himself desirous, so did he know that his father was in like manner\ndesirous also, to have him found entirely innocent. But Antipater fell\ndown on his face, and appealed to God and to all men for testimonials of\nhis innocency, desiring that God would declare, by some evident signals,\nthat he had not laid any plot against his father. This being the usual\nmethod of all men destitute of virtue, that when they set about any wicked\nundertakings, they fall to work according to their own inclinations, as\nif they believed that God was unconcerned in human affairs; but when once\nthey are found out, and are in danger of undergoing the punishment due\nto their crimes, they endeavor to overthrow all the evidence against them\nby appealing to God; which was the very thing which Antipater now did;\nfor whereas he had done everything as if there were no God in the world,\nwhen he was on all sides distressed by justice, and when he had no other\nadvantage to expect from any legal proofs, by which he might disprove the\naccusations laid against him, he impudently abused the majesty of God,\nand ascribed it to his power that he had been preserved hitherto; and produced\nbefore them all what difficulties he had ever undergone in his bold acting\nfor his father's preservation.", "So when Varus, upon asking Antipater what he had to say for himself,\nfound that he had nothing to say besides his appeal to God, and saw that\nthere was no end of that, he bid them bring the potion before the court,\nthat he might see what virtue still remained in it; and when it was brought,\nand one that was condemned to die had drank it by Varus's command, he died\npresently. Then Varus got up, and departed out of the court, and went away\nthe day following to Antioch, where his usual residence was, because that\nwas the palace of the Syrians; upon which Herod laid his son in bonds.\nBut what were Varus's discourses to Herod was not known to the generality,\nand upon what words it was that he went away; though it was also generally\nsupposed that whatsoever Herod did afterward about his son was done with\nhis approbation. But when Herod had bound his son, he sent letters to Rome\nto Caesar about him, and such messengers withal as should, by word of mouth,\ninform Caesar of Antipater's wickedness. Now at this very time there was\nseized a letter of Antiphilus, written to Antipater out of Egypt (for he\nlived there); and when it was opened by the king, it was found to contain\nwhat follows: \"I have sent thee Acme's letter, and hazarded my own\nlife; for thou knowest that I am in danger from two families, if I be discovered.\nI wish thee good success in thy affair.\" These were the contents of\nthis letter; but the king made inquiry about the other letter also, for\nit did not appear; and Antiphilus's slave, who brought that letter which\nhad been read, denied that he had received the other. But while the king\nwas in doubt about it, one of Herod's friends seeing a seam upon the inner\ncoat of the slave, and a doubling of the cloth, (for he had two coats on,)\nhe guessed that the letter might be within that doubling; which accordingly\nproved to be true. So they took out the letter, and its contents were these:\n\"Acme to Antipater. I have written such a letter to thy father as\nthou desiredst me. I have also taken a copy and sent it, as if it came\nfrom Salome, to my lady [Livia]; which, when thou readest, I know that\nHerod Will punish Salome, as plotting against him?\" Now this pretended\nletter of Salome to her lady was composed by Antipater, in the name of\nSalome, as to its meaning, but in the words of Acme. The letter was this:\n\"Acme to king Herod. I have done my endeavor that nothing that is\ndone against thee should be concealed from thee. So, upon my finding a\nletter of Salome written to my lady against thee, I have written out a\ncopy, and sent it to thee; with hazard to myself, but for thy advantage.\nThe reason why she wrote it was this, that she had a mind to be married\nto Sylleus. Do thou therefore tear this letter in pieces, that I may not\ncome into danger of my life.\" Now Acme had written to Antipater himself,\nand informed him, that, in compliance with his command, she had both herself\nwritten to Herod, as if Salome had laid a sudden plot entirely against\nhim, and had herself sent a copy of an epistle, as coming from Salome to\nher lady. Now Acme was a Jew by birth, and a servant to Julia, Caesar's\nwife; and did this out of her friendship for Antipater, as having been\ncorrupted by him with a large present of money, to assist in his pernicious\ndesigns against his father and his aunt.", "Hereupon Herod was so amazed at the prodigious wickedness of Antipater,\nthat he was ready to have ordered him to be slain immediately, as a turbulent\nperson in the most important concerns, and as one that had laid a plot\nnot only against himself, but against his sister also, and even corrupted\nCaesar's own domestics. Salome also provoked him to it, beating her breast,\nand bidding him kill her, if he could produce any credible testimony that\nshe had acted in that manner. Herod also sent for his son, and asked him\nabout this matter, and bid him contradict if he could, and not suppress\nany thing he had to say for himself; and when he had not one word to say,\nhe asked him, since he was every way caught in his villainy, that he would\nmake no further delay, but discover his associates in these his wicked\ndesigns. So he laid all upon Antiphilus, but discovered nobody else. Hereupon\nHerod was in such great grief, that he was ready to send his son to Rome\nto Caesar, there to give an account of these his wicked contrivances. But\nhe soon became afraid, lest he might there, by the assistance of his friends,\nescape the danger he was in; so he kept him bound as before, and sent more\nambassadors and letters [to Rome] to accuse his son, and an account of\nwhat assistance Acme had given him in his wicked designs, with copies of\nthe epistles before mentioned.", "NOW Herod's ambassadors made haste to Rome; but sent, as instructed\nbeforehand, what answers they were to make to the questions put to them.\nThey also carried the epistles with them. But Herod now fell into a distemper,\nand made his will, and bequeathed his kingdom to [Antipas], his youngest\nson; and this out of that hatred to Archclaus and Philip, which the calumnies\nof Antipater had raised against them. He also bequeathed .a thousand talents\nto Caesar, and five hundred to Julia, Caesar's wife, to Caesar's children,\nand friends and freed-men. He also distributed among his sons and their\nsons his money, his revenues, and his lands. He also made Salome his sister\nvery rich, because she had continued faithful to him in all his circumstances,\nand was never so rash as to do him any harm; and as he despaired of recovering,\nfor he was about the seventieth year of his age, he grew fierce, and indulged\nthe bitterest anger upon all occasions; the cause whereof was this, that\nhe thought himself despised, and that the nation was pleased with his misfortunes;\nbesides which, he resented a sedition which some of the lower sort of men\nexcited against him, the occasion of which was as follows.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "That the making of images, without an intention to worship them, was not\nunlawful to the Jews, see the note on Antiq.

These men, when\nthey found that the king's distemper was incurable, excited the young men\nthat they would pull down all those works which the king had erected contrary\nto the law of their fathers, and thereby obtain the rewards which the law\nwill confer on them for such actions of piety; for that it was truly on\naccount of Herod's rashness in making such things as the law had forbidden,\nthat his other misfortunes, and this distemper also, which was so unusual\namong mankind, and with which he was now afflicted, came upon him; for\nHerod had caused such things to be made which were contrary to the law,\nof which he was accused by Judas and Matthias; for the king had erected\nover the great gate of the temple a large golden eagle, of great value,\nand had dedicated it to the temple. Now the law forbids those that propose\nto live according to it, to erect images \nor representations of any living creature. So these wise men persuaded\n[their scholars] to pull down the golden eagle; alleging, that although\nthey should incur any danger, which might bring them to their deaths, the\nvirtue of the action now proposed to them would appear much more advantageous\nto them than the pleasures of life; since they would die for the preservation\nand observation of the law of their fathers; since they would also acquire\nan everlasting fame and commendation; since they would be both commended\nby the present generation, and leave an example of life that would never\nbe forgotten to posterity; since that common calamity of dying cannot be\navoided by our living so as to escape any such dangers; that therefore\nit is a right thing for those who are in love with a virtuous conduct,\nto wait for that fatal hour by such behavior as may carry them out of the\nworld with praise and honor; and that this will alleviate death to a great\ndegree, thus to come at it by the performance of brave actions, which bring\nus into danger of it; and at the same time to leave that reputation behind\nthem to their children, and to all their relations, whether they be men\nor women, which will be of great advantage to them afterward."}, "And with such discourses as this did these men excite the young men\nto this action; and a report being come to them that the king was dead,\nthis was an addition to the wise men's persuasions; so, in the very middle\nof the day, they got upon the place, they pulled down the eagle, and cut\nit into pieces with axes, while a great number of the people were in the\ntemple. And now the king's captain, upon hearing what the undertaking was,\nand supposing it was a thing of a higher nature than it proved to be, came\nup thither, having a great band of soldiers with him, such as was sufficient\nto put a stop to the multitude of those who pulled down what was dedicated\nto God; so he fell upon them unexpectedly, and as they were upon this bold\nattempt, in a foolish presumption rather than a cautious circumspection,\nas is usual with the multitude, and while they were in disorder, and incautious\nof what was for their advantage; so he caught no fewer than forty of the\nyoung men, who had the courage to stay behind when the rest ran away, together\nwith the authors of this bold attempt, Judas and Matthius, who thought\nit an ignominious thing to retire upon his approach, and led them to the\nking. And when they were come to the king, and he asked them if they had\nbeen so bold as to pull down what he had dedicated to God, \"Yes, (said\nthey,) what was contrived we contrived, and what hath been performed we\nperformed it, and that with such a virtuous courage as becomes men; for\nwe have given our assistance to those things which were dedicated to the\nmajesty of God, and we have provided for what we have learned by hearing\nthe law; and it ought not to be wondered at, if we esteem those laws which\nMoses had suggested to him, and were taught him by God, and which he wrote\nand left behind him, more worthy of observation than thy commands. Accordingly\nwe will undergo death, and all sorts of punishments which thou canst inflict\nupon us, with pleasure, since we are conscious to ourselves that we shall\ndie, not for any unrighteous actions, but for our love to religion.\"\nAnd thus they all said, and their courage was still equal to their profession,\nand equal to that with which they readily set about this undertaking. And\nwhen the king had ordered them to be bound, he sent them to Jericho, and\ncalled together the principal men among the Jews; and when they were come,\nhe made them assemble in the theater, and because he could not himself\nstand, he lay upon a couch, and enumerated the many labors that he had\nlong endured on their account, and his building of the temple, and what\na vast charge that was to him; while the Asamoneans, during the hundred\nand twenty-five years of their government, had not been able to perform\nany so great a work for the honor of God as that was; that he had also\nadorned it with very valuable donations, on which account he hoped that\nhe had left himself a memorial, and procured himself a reputation after\nhis death. He then cried out, that these men had not abstained from affronting\nhim, even in his lifetime, but that in the very day time, and in the sight\nof the multitude, they had abused him to that degree, as to fall upon what\nhe had dedicated, and in that way of abuse had pulled it down to the ground.\nThey pretended, indeed, that they did it to affront him; but if any one\nconsider the thing truly, they will find that they were guilty of sacrilege\nagainst God therein.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This fact, that one Joseph was made high priest for a single day, on occasion\nof the action here specified, that befell Matthias, the real high priest,\nin his sleep, the night before the great day of expiation, is attested\nto both in the Mishna and Talmud, as Dr. Hudson here informs us.

His entrails were also ex-ulcerated, and the chief violence of his\npain lay on his colon; an aqueous and transparent liquor also had settled\nitself about his feet, and a like matter afflicted him at the bottom of\nhis belly. Nay, further, his privy-member was putrefied, and produced worms;\nand when he sat upright, he had a difficulty of breathing, which was very\nloathsome, on account of the stench of his breath, and the quickness of\nits returns; he had also convulsions in all parts of his body, which increased\nhis strength to an insufferable degree. It was said by those who pretended\nto divine, and who were endued with wisdom to foretell such things, that\nGod inflicted this punishment on the king on account of his great impiety;\nyet was he still in hopes of recovering, though his afflictions seemed\ngreater than any one could bear. He also sent for physicians, and did not\nrefuse to follow what they prescribed for his assistance, and went beyond\nthe river Jordan, and bathed himself in the warm baths that were at Callirrhoe,\nwhich, besides their other general virtues, were also fit to drink; which\nwater runs into the lake called Asphaltiris. And when the physicians once\nthought fit to have him bathed in a vessel full of oil, it was supposed\nthat he was just dying; but upon the lamentable cries of his domestics,\nhe revived; and having no longer the least hopes of recovering, he gave\norder that every soldier should be paid fifty drachmae; and he also gave\na great deal to their commanders, and to his friends, and came again to\nJericho, where he grew so choleric, that it brought him to do all things\nlike a madman; and though he were near his death, he contrived the following\nwicked designs. He commanded that all the principal men of the entire Jewish\nnation, wheresoever they lived, should be called to him. Accordingly, they\nwere a great number that came, because the whole nation was called, and\nall men heard of this call, and death was the penalty of such as should\ndespise the epistles that were sent to call them. And now the king was\nin a wild rage against them all, the innocent as well as those that had\nafforded ground for accusations; and when they were come, he ordered them\nto be all shut up in the hyppodrome, \nand sent for his sister Salome, and her husband Alexas, and spake thus\nto them: \"I shall die in a little time, so great are my pains; which\ndeath ought to be cheerfully borne, and to be welcomed by all men; but\nwhat principally troubles me is this, that I shall die without being lamented,\nand without such mourning as men usually expect at a king's death.\" For\nthat he was not unacquainted with the temper of the Jews, that his death\nwould be a thing very desirable, and exceedingly acceptable to them, because\nduring his lifetime they were ready to revolt from him, and to abuse the\ndonations he had dedicated to God that it therefore was their business\nto resolve to afford him some alleviation of his great sorrows on this\noccasion; for that if they do not refuse him their consent in what he desires,\nhe shall have a great mourning at his funeral, and such as never had any\nking before him; for then the whole nation would mourn from their very\nsoul, which otherwise would be done in sport and mockery only. He desired\ntherefore, that as soon as they see he hath given up the ghost, they shall\nplace soldiers round the hippodrome, while they do not know that he is\ndead; and that they shall not declare his death to the multitude till this\nis done, but that they shall give orders to have those that are in custody\nshot with their darts; and that this slaughter of them all will cause that\nhe shall not miss to rejoice on a double account; that as he is dying,\nthey will make him secure that his will shall be executed in what he charges\nthem to do; and that he shall have the honor of a memorable mourning at\nhis funeral. So he deplored his condition, with tears in his eyes, and\nobtested them by the kindness due from them, as of his kindred, and by\nthe faith they owed to God, and begged of them that they would not hinder\nhim of this honorable mourning at his funeral. So they promised him not\nto transgress his commands."}, "Now any one may easily discover the temper of this man's mind, which\nnot only took pleasure in doing what he had done formerly against his relations,\nout of the love of life, but by those commands of his which savored of\nno humanity; since he took care, when he was departing out of this life,\nthat the whole nation should be put into mourning, and indeed made desolate\nof their dearest kindred, when he gave order that one out of every family\nshould be slain, although they had done nothing that was unjust, or that\nwas against him, nor were they accused of any other crimes; while it is\nusual for those who have any regard to virtue to lay aside their hatred\nat such a time, even with respect to those they justly esteemed their enemies.", "AS he was giving these commands to his relations, there came letters\nfrom his ambassadors, who had been sent to Rome unto Caesar, which, when\nthey were read, their purport was this: That Acme was slain by Caesar,\nout of his indignation at what hand, she had in Antipater's wicked practices;\nand that as to Antipater himself, Caesar left it to Herod to act as became\na father and a king, and either to banish him, or to take away his life,\nwhich he pleased. When Herod heard this, he was some-what better, out of\nthe pleasure he had from the contents of the letters, and was elevated\nat the death of Acme, and at the power that was given him over his son;\nbut as his pains were become very great, he was now ready to faint for\nwant of somewhat to eat; so he called for an apple and a knife; for it\nwas his custom formerly to pare the apple himself, and soon afterwards\nto cut it, and eat it. When he had got the knife, he looked about, and\nhad a mind to stab himself with it; and he had done it, had not his first\ncousin, Achiabus, prevented him, and held his hand, and cried out loudly.\nWhereupon a woeful lamentation echoed through the palace, and a great tumult\nwas made, as if the king were dead. Upon which Antipater, who verily believed\nhis father was deceased, grew bold in his discourse, as hoping to be immediately\nand entirely released from his bonds, and to take the kingdom into his\nhands without any more ado; so he discoursed with the jailer about letting\nhim go, and in that case promised him great things, both now and hereafter,\nas if that were the only thing now in question.

So he ascended\na high elevation made for him, and took his seat, in a throne made of gold,\nand spake kindly to the multitude, and declared with what joy he received\ntheir acclamations, and the marks of the good-will they showed to him;\nand returned them thanks that they did not remember the injuries his father\nhad done them to his disadvantage; and promised them he would endeavor\nnot to be behindhand with them in rewarding their alacrity in his service,\nafter a suitable manner; but that he should abstain at present from the\nname of king, and that he should have the honor of that dignity, if Caesar\nshould confirm and settle that testament which his father had made; and\nthat it was on this account, that when the army would have put the diadem\non him at Jericho, he would not accept of that honor, which is usually\nso much desired, because it was not yet evident that he who was to be principally\nconcerned in bestowing it would give it him; although, by his acceptance\nof the government, he should not want the ability of rewarding their kindness\nto him and that it should be his endeavor, as to all things wherein they\nwere concerned, to prove in every respect better than his father. Whereupon\nthe multitude, as it is usual with them, supposed that the first days of\nthose that enter upon such governments declare the intentions of those\nthat accept them; and so by how much Archelaus spake the more gently and\ncivilly to them, by so much did they more highly commend him, and made\napplication to him for the grant of what they desired. Some made a clamor\nthat he would ease them of some of their annual payments; but others desired\nhim to release those that were put into prison by Herod, who were many,\nand had been put there at several times; others of them required that he\nwould take away those taxes which had been severely laid upon what was\npublicly sold and bought. So Archelaus contradicted them in nothing, since\nhe pretended to do all things so as to get the good-will of the multitude\nto him, as looking upon that good-will to be a great step towards his preservation\nof the government. Hereupon he went and offered sacrifice to God, and then\nbetook himself to feast with his friends.", "AT this time also it was that some of the Jews got together out of\na desire of innovation. They lamented Matthias, and those that were slain\nwith him by Herod, who had not any respect paid them by a funeral mourning,\nout of the fear men were in of that man; they were those who had been condemned\nfor pulling down the golden eagle. The people made a great clamor and lamentation\nhereupon, and cast out some reproaches against the king also, as if that\ntended to alleviate the miseries of the deceased. The people assembled\ntogether, and desired of Archelaus, that, in way of revenge on their account,\nhe would inflict punishment on those who had been honored by Herod; and\nthat, in the first and principal place, he would deprive that high priest\nwhom Herod had made, and would choose one more agreeable to the law, and\nof greater purity, to officiate as high priest. This was granted by Archelaus,\nalthough he was mightily offended at their importunity, because he proposed\nto himself to go to Rome immediately to look after Caesar's determination\nabout him. However, he sent the general of his forces to use persuasions,\nand to tell them that the death which was inflicted on their friends was\naccording to the law; and to represent to them that their petitions about\nthese things were carried to a great height of injury to him; that the\ntime was not now proper for such petitions, but required their unanimity\nuntil such time as he should be established in the government by the consent\nof Caesar, and should then be come back to them; for that he would then\nconsult with them in common concerning the purport of their petitions;\nbut that they ought at present to be quiet, lest they should seem seditious\npersons.", "So when the king had suggested these things, and instructed his general\nin what he was to say, be sent him away to the people; but they made a\nclamor, and would not give him leave to speak, and put him in danger of\nhis life, and as many more as were desirous to venture upon saying openly\nany thing which might reduce them to a sober mind, and prevent their going\non in their present courses, because they had more concern to have all\ntheir own wills performed than to yield obedience to their governors; thinking\nit to be a thing insufferable, that, while Herod was alive, they should\nlose those that were most dear to them, and that when he was dead, they\ncould not get the actors to be punished. So they went on with their designs\nafter a violent manner, and thought all to be lawful and right which tended\nto please them, and being unskillful in foreseeing what dangers they incurred;\nand when they had suspicion of such a thing, yet did the present pleasure\nthey took in the punishment of those they deemed their enemies overweigh\nall such considerations; and although Archelaus sent many to speak to them,\nyet they treated them not as messengers sent by him, but as persons that\ncame of their own accord to mitigate their anger, and would not let one\nof them speak. The sedition also was made by such as were in a great passion;\nand it was evident that they were proceeding further in seditious practices,\nby the multitude running so fast upon them.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This passover, when the sedition here mentioned was moved against Archelaus,\nwas not one, but thirteen months after the eclipse of the moon already\nmentioned."}, "#text": "Now, upon the approach of that feast of unleavened bread, which the\nlaw of their fathers had appointed for the Jews at this time, which feast\nis called the Passover \nand is a memorial of their deliverance out of Egypt, when they offer sacrifices\nwith great alacrity; and when they are required to slay more sacrifices\nin number than at any other festival; and when an innumerable multitude\ncame thither out of the country, nay, from beyond its limits also, in order\nto worship God, the seditious lamented Judas and Matthias, those teachers\nof the laws, and kept together in the temple, and had plenty of food, because\nthese seditious persons were not ashamed to beg it. And as Archelaus was\nafraid lest some terrible thing should spring up by means of these men's\nmadness, he sent a regiment of armed men, and with them a captain of a\nthousand, to suppress the violent efforts of the seditious before the whole\nmultitude should be infected with the like madness; and gave them this\ncharge, that if they found any much more openly seditious than others,\nand more busy in tumultuous practices, they should bring them to him. But\nthose that were seditious on account of those teachers of the law, irritated\nthe people by the noise and clamors they used to encourage the people in\ntheir designs; so they made an assault upon the soldiers, and came up to\nthem, and stoned the greatest part of them, although some of them ran away\nwounded, and their captain among them; and when they had thus done, they\nreturned to the sacrifices which were already in their hands. Now Archelaus\nthought there was no way to preserve the entire government but by cutting\noff those who made this attempt upon it; so he sent out the whole army\nupon them, and sent the horsemen to prevent those that had their tents\nwithout the temple from assisting those that were within the temple, and\nto kill such as ran away from the footmen when they thought themselves\nout of danger; which horsemen slew three thousand men, while the rest went\nto the neighboring mountains. Then did Archelaus order proclamation to\nbe made to them all, that they should retire to their own homes; so they\nwent away, and left the festival, out of fear of somewhat worse which would\nfollow, although they had been so bold by reason of their want of instruction.\nSo Archelaus went down to the sea with his mother, and took with him Nicolaus\nand Ptolemy, and many others of his friends, and left Philip his brother\nas governor of all things belonging both to his own family and to the public.\nThere went out also with him Salome, Herod's sister who took with her,\nher children, and many of her kindred were with her; which kindred of hers\nwent, as they pretended, to assist Archelaus in gaining the kingdom, but\nin reality to oppose him, and chiefly to make loud complaints of what he\nhad done in the temple. But Sabinus, Caesar's steward for Syrian affairs,\nas he was making haste into Judea to preserve Herod's effects, met with\nArchclaus at Caesarea; but Varus (president of Syria) came at that time,\nand restrained him from meddling with them, for he was there as sent for\nby Archceaus, by the means of Ptolemy. And Sabinus, out of regard to Varus,\ndid neither seize upon any of the castles that were among the Jews, nor\ndid he seal up the treasures in them, but permitted Archelaus to have them,\nuntil Caesar should declare his resolution about them; so that, upon this\nhis promise, he tarried still at Cesarea. But after Archelaus was sailed\nfor Rome, and Varus was removed to Antioch, Sabinus went to Jerusalem,\nand seized on the king's palace. He also sent for the keepers of the garrisons,\nand for all those that had the charge of Herod's effects, and declared\npublicly that he should require them to give an account of what they had;\nand he disposed of the castles in the manner he pleased; but those who\nkept them did not neglect what Archelaus had given them in command, but\ncontinued to keep all things in the manner that had been enjoined them;\nand their pretense was, that they kept them all for Caesar,"}, "At the same time also did Antipas, another of Herod's sons, sail\nto Rome, in order to gain the government; being buoyed up by Salome with\npromises that he should take that government; and that he was a much honester\nand fitter man than Archelaus for that authority, since Herod had, in his\nformer testament, deemed him the worthiest to be made king, which ought\nto be esteemed more valid than his latter testament. Antipas also brought\nwith him his mother, and Ptolemy the brother of Nicolaus, one that had\nbeen Herod's most honored friend, and was now zealous for Antipas; but\nit was Ireneus the orator, and one who, on account of his reputation for\nsagacity, was intrusted with the affairs of the kingdom, who most of all\nencouraged him to attempt to gain the kingdom; by whose means it was, that\nwhen some advised him to yield to Archelaus, as to his elder brother, and\nwho had been declared king by their father's last will, he would not submit\nso to do. And when he was come to Rome, all his relations revolted to him;\nnot out of their good-will to him, but out of their hatred to Archelaus;\nthough indeed they were most of all desirous of gaining their liberty,\nand to be put under a Roman governor; but if there were too great an opposition\nmade to that, they thought Antipas preferable to Archelaus, and so joined\nwith him, in order to procure the kingdom for him. Sabinus also, by letters,\naccused Archelaus to Caesar.", "Now when Archelaus had sent in his papers to Caesar, wherein he pleaded\nhis right to. the kingdom, and his father's testament, with the accounts\nof Herod's money, and with Ptolemy, who brought Herod's seal, he so expected\nthe event; but when Caesar had read these papers, and Varus's and Sabinus's\nletters, with the accounts of the money, and what were the annual incomes\nof the kingdom, and understood that Antipas had also sent letters to lay\nclaim to the kingdom, he summoned his friends together, to know their opinions,\nand with them Caius, the son of Agrippa, and of Julia his daughter, whom\nhe had adopted, and took him, and made him sit first of all, and desired\nsuch as pleased to speak their minds about the affairs now before them.\nNow Antipater, Salome's son, a very subtle orator, and a bitter enemy to\nArchelaus, spake first to this purpose: That it was ridiculous in Archelaus\nto plead now to have the kingdom given him, since he had, in reality, taken\nalready the power over it to himself, before Caesar had granted it to him;\nand appealed to those bold actions of his, in destroying so many at the\nJewish festival; and if the men had acted unjustly, it was but fit the\npunishing of them should have been reserved to those that were out of the\ncountry, but had the power to punish them, and not been executed by a man\nthat, if he pretended to be a king, he did an injury to Caesar, by usurping\nthat authority before it was determined for him by Caesar; but if he owned\nhimself to be a private person, his case was much worse, since he who was\nputting in for the kingdom could by no means expect to have that power\ngranted him, of which he had already deprived Caesar [by taking it to himself].\nHe also touched sharply upon him, and appealed to his changing the commanders\nin the army, and his sitting in the royal throne beforehand, and his determination\nof law-suits; all done as if he were no other than a king. He appealed\nalso to his concessions to those that petitioned him on a public account,\nand indeed doing such things, than which he could devise no greater if\nhe had been already settled in the kingdom by Caesar. He also ascribed\nto him the releasing of the prisoners that were in the hippodrome, and\nmany other things, that either had been certainly done by him, or were\nbelieved to be done, and easily might be believed to have been done, because\nthey were of such a nature as to be usually done by young men, and by such\nas, out of a desire of ruling, seize upon the government too soon. He also\ncharged him with his neglect of the funeral mourning for his father, and\nwith having merry meetings the very night in which he died; and that it\nwas thence the multitude took the handle of raising a tumult: and if Archelaus\ncould thus requite his dead father, who had bestowed such benefits upon\nhim, and bequeathed such great things to him, by pretending to shed tears\nfor him in the day time, like an actor on the stage, but every night making\nmirth for having gotten the government, he would appear to be the same\nArchelaus with regard to Caesar, if he granted him the kingdom, which he\nhath been to his father; since he had then dancing and singing, as though\nan enemy of his were fallen, and not as though a man were carried to his\nfuneral, that was so nearly related, and had been so great a benefactor\nto him. But he said that the greatest crime of all was this, that he came\nnow before Caesar to obtain the government by his grant, while he had before\nacted in all things as he could have acted if Caesar himself, who ruled\nall, had fixed him firmly in the government. And what he most aggravated\nin his pleading was the slaughter of those about the temple, and the impiety\nof it, as done at the festival; and how they were slain like sacrifices\nthemselves, some of whom were foreigners, and others of their own country,\ntill the temple was full of dead bodies: and all this was done, not by\nan alien, but by one who pretended to the lawful title of a king, that\nhe might complete the wicked tyranny which his nature prompted him to,\nand which is hated by all men. On which account his father never so much\nas dreamed of making him his successor in the kingdom, when he was of a\nsound mind, because he knew his disposition; and in his former and more\nauthentic testament, he appointed his antagonist Antipas to succeed; but\nthat Archelaus was called by his father to that dignity when he was in\na dying condition, both of body and mind; while Antipas was called when\nhe was ripest in his judgment, and of such strength of body as made him\ncapable of managing his own affairs: and if his father had the like notion\nof him formerly that he hath now showed, yet hath he given a sufficient\nspecimen what a king he is likely to be, when he hath [in effect] deprived\nCaesar of that power of disposing of the kingdom, which he justly hath,\nand hath not abstained from making a terrible slaughter of his fellow citizens\nin the temple, while lie was but a private person.", "So when Antipater had made this speech, and had confirmed what he\nhad said by producing many witnesses from among Archelaus's own relations,\nhe made an end of his pleading. Upon which Nicolaus arose up to plead for\nArchelaus, and said, \"That what had been done at the temple was rather\nto be attributed to the mind of those that had been killed, than to the\nauthority of Archelaus; for that those who were the authors of such things\nare not only wicked in the injuries they do of themselves, but in forcing\nsober persons to avenge themselves upon them. Now it is evident that what\nthese did in way of opposition was done under pretense, indeed, against\nArchelaus, but in reality against Caesar himself, for they, after an injurious\nmanner, attacked and slew those who were sent by Archelaus, and who came\nonly to put a stop to their doings. They had no regard, either to God or\nto the festival, whom Antipater yet is not ashamed to patronize, whether\nit be out of his indulgence of an enmity to Archelaus, or out of his hatred\nof virtue and justice. For as to those who begin such tumults, and first\nset about such unrighteous actions, they are the men who force those that\npunish them to betake themselves to arms even against their will. So that\nAntipater in effect ascribes the rest of what was done to all those who\nwere of counsel to the accusers; for nothing which is here accused of injustice\nhas been done but what was derived from them as its authors; nor are those\nthings evil in themselves, but so represented only in order to do harm\nto Archelaus. Such is these men's inclination to do an injury to a man\nthat is of their kindred, their father's benefactor, and familiarity acquainted\nwith them, and that hath ever lived in friendship with them; for that,\nas to this testament, it was made by the king when he was of a sound mind,\nand so ought to be of more authority than his former testament; and that\nfor this reason, because Caesar is therein left to be the judge and disposer\nof all therein contained; and for Caesar, he will not, to be sure, at all\nimitate the unjust proceedings of those men, who, during Herod's whole\nlife, had on all occasions been joint partakers of power with him, and\nyet do zealously endeavor to injure his determination, while they have\nnot themselves had the same regard to their kinsman [which Archelaus had].\nCaesar will not therefore disannul the testament of a man whom he had entirely\nsupported, of his friend and confederate, and that which is committed to\nhim in trust to ratify; nor will Caesar's virtuous and upright disposition,\nwhich is known and uncontested through all the habitable world, imitate\nthe wickedness of these men in condemning a king as a madman, and as having\nlost his reason, while he hath bequeathed the succession to a good son\nof his, and to one who flies to Caesar's upright determination for refuge.\nNor can Herod at any time have been mistaken in his judgment about a successor,\nwhile he showed so much prudence as to submit all to Caesar's determination.\"", "Now when Nicolaus had laid these things before Caesar, he ended his\nplea; whereupon Caesar was so obliging to Archelaus, that he raised him\nup when he had cast himself down at his feet, and said that he well deserved\nthe kingdom; and he soon let them know that he was so far moved in his\nfavor, that he would not act otherwise than his father's testament directed,\nand than was for the advantage of Archelaus. However, while he gave this\nencouragement to Archelaus to depend on him securely, he made no full determination\nabout him; and when the assembly was broken up, he considered by himself\nwhether he should confirm the kingdom to Archelaus, or whether he should\npart it among all Herod's posterity; and this because they all stood in\nneed of much assistance to support them.", "BUT before these things could be brought to a settlement, Malthace,\nArchelaus's mother, fell into a distemper, and died of it; and letters\ncame from Varus, the president of Syria, which informed Caesar of the revolt\nof the Jews; for after Archlaus was sailed, the whole nation was in a tumult.\nSo Varus, since he was there himself, brought the authors of the disturbance\nto punishment; and when he had restrained them for the most part from this\nsedition, which was a great one, he took his journey to Antiocli, leaving\none legion of his army at Jerusalem to keep the Jews quiet, who were now\nvery fond of innovation. Yet did not this at all avail to put an end to\nthat their sedition; for after Varus was gone away, Sabinus, Caesar's procurator,\nstaid behind, and greatly distressed the Jews, relying on the forces that\nwere left there that they would by their multitude protect him; for he\nmade use of them, and armed them as his guards, thereby so oppressing the\nJews, and giving them so great disturbance, that at length they rebelled;\nfor he used force in seizing the citadels, and zealously pressed on the\nsearch after the king's money, in order to seize upon it by force, on account\nof his love of gain and his extraordinary covetousness.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "See Antiq.

B. XX. ch. 9. sect. 7. See the note on that place."}], "#text": "But on the approach of pentecost, which is a festival of ours, so\ncalled from the days of our forefathers, a great many ten thousands of\nmen got together; nor did they come only to celebrate the festival, but\nout of their indignation at the madness of Sabinus, and at the injuries\nhe offered them. A great number there was of Galileans, and Idumeans, and\nmany men from Jericho, and others who had passed over the river Jordan,\nand inhabited those parts. This whole multitude joined themselves to all\nthe rest, and were more zealous than the others in making an assault on\nSabinus, in order to be avenged on him; so they parted themselves into\nthree bands, and encamped themselves in the places following: - some of\nthem seized on the hippodrome and of the other two bands, one pitched themselves\nfrom the northern part of the temple to the southern, on the east quarter;\nbut the third band held the western part of the city, where the king's\npalace was. Their work tended entirely to besiege the Romans, and to enclose\nthem on all sides. Now Sabinus was afraid of these men's number, and of\ntheir resolution, who had little regard to their lives, but were very desirous\nnot to be overcome, while they thought it a point of puissance to overcome\ntheir enemies; so he sent immediately a letter to Varus, and, as he used\nto do, was very pressing with him, and entreated him to come quickly to\nhis assistance, because the forces he had left were in imminent danger,\nand would probably, in no long time, be seized upon, and cut to pieces;\nwhile he did himself get up to the highest tower of the fortress Phasaelus,\nwhich had been built in honor of Phasaelus, king Herod's brother, and called\nso when the Parthians had brought him to his death. \nSo Sabinus gave thence a signal to the Romans to fall upon the Jews, although\nhe did not himself venture so much as to come down to his friends, and\nthought he might expect that the others should expose themselves first\nto die on account of his avarice. However, the Romans ventured to make\na sally out of the place, and a terrible battle ensued; wherein, though\nit is true the Romans beat their adversaries, yet were not the Jews daunted\nin their resolutions, even when they had the sight of that terrible slaughter\nthat was made of them; but they went round about, and got upon those cloisters\nwhich encompassed the outer court of the temple, where a great fight was\nstill continued, and they cast stones at the Romans, partly with their\nhands, and partly with slings, as being much used to those exercises. All\nthe archers also in array did the Romans a great deal of mischief, because\nthey used their hands dexterously from a place superior to the others,\nand because the others were at an utter loss what to do; for when they\ntried to shoot their arrows against the Jews upwards, these arrows could\nnot reach them, insomuch that the Jews were easily too hard for their enemies.\nAnd this sort of fight lasted a great while, till at last the Romans, who\nwere greatly distressed by what was done, set fire to the cloisters so\nprivately, that those that were gotten upon them did not perceive it. This\nfire \nbeing fed by a great deal of combustible matter, caught hold immediately\non the roof of the cloisters; so the wood, which was full of pitch and\nwax, and whose gold was laid on it with wax, yielded to the flame presently,\nand those vast works, which were of the highest value and esteem, were\ndestroyed utterly, while those that were on the roof unexpectedly perished\nat the same time; for as the roof tumbled down, some of these men tumbled\ndown with it, and others of them were killed by their enemies who encompassed\nthem. There was a great number more, who, out of despair of saving their\nlives, and out of astonishment at the misery that surrounded them, did\neither cast themselves into the fire, or threw themselves upon their swords,\nand so got out of their misery. But as to those that retired behind the\nsame way by which they ascended, and thereby escaped, they were all killed\nby the Romans, as being unarmed men, and their courage failing them; their\nwild fury being now not able to help them, because they were destitute\nof armor, insomuch that of those that went up to the top of the roof, not\none escaped. The Romans also rushed through the fire, where it gave them\nroom so to do, and seized on that treasure where the sacred money was reposited;\na great part of which was stolen by the soldiers, and Sabinus got openly\nfour hundred talents."}, "But this calamity of the Jews' friends, who fell in this battle,\ngrieved them, as did also this plundering of the money dedicated to God\nin the temple. Accordingly, that body of them which continued best together,\nand was the most warlike, encompassed the palace, and threatened to set\nfire to it, and kill all that were in it. Yet still they commanded them\nto go out presently, and promised, that if they would do so, they would\nnot hurt them, nor Sabinus neither; at which time the greatest part of\nthe king's troops deserted to them, while Rufus and Gratus, who had three\nthousand of the most warlike of Herod's army with them, who were men of\nactive bodies, went over to the Romans. There was also a band of horsemen\nunder the command of Ruffis, which itself went over to the Romans also.\nHowever, the Jews went on with the siege, and dug mines under the palace\nwalls, and besought those that were gone over to the other side not to\nbe their hinderance, now they had such a proper opportunity for the recovery\nof their country's ancient liberty; and for Sabinus, truly he was desirous\nof going away with his soldiers, but was not able to trust himself with\nthe enemy, on account of what mischief he had already done them; and he\ntook this great [pretended] lenity of theirs for an argument why he should\nnot comply with them; and so, because he expected that Varus was coming,\nhe still bore the siege.", "Now at this time there were ten thousand other disorders in Judea,\nwhich were like tumults, because a great number put themselves into a warlike\nposture, either out of hopes of gain to themselves, or out of enmity to\nthe Jews. In particular, two thousand of Herod's old soldiers, who had\nbeen already disbanded, got together in Judea itself, and fought against\nthe king's troops, although Achiabus, Herod's first cousin, opposed them;\nbut as he was driven out of the plains into the mountainous parts by the\nmilitary skill of those men, he kept himself in the fastnesses that were\nthere, and saved what he could.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Unless this Judas, the son of Ezekias, be the same with that Theudas, mentioned\nActs 5:36, Josephus must have omitted him; for that other Thoualas, whom\nhe afterward mentions, under Fadus the Roman governor, B.

This man was elevated at the disorderly state of\nthings, and was so bold as to put a diadem on his head, while a certain\nnumber of the people stood by him, and by them he was declared to be a\nking, and thought himself more worthy of that dignity than any one else.\nHe burnt down the royal palace at Jericho, and plundered what was left\nin it. He also set fire to many other of the king's houses in several places\nof the country, and utterly destroyed them, and permitted those that were\nwith him to take what was left in them for a prey; and he would have done\ngreater things, unless care had been taken to repress him immediately;\nfor Gratus, when he had joined himself to some Roman soldiers, took the\nforces he had with him, and met Simon, and after a great and a long fight,\nno small part of those that came from Perea, who were a disordered body\nof men, and fought rather in a bold than in a skillful manner, were destroyed;\nand although Simon had saved himself by flying away through a certain valley,\nyet Gratus overtook him, and cut off his head. The royal palace also at\nAmathus, by the river Jordan, was burnt down by a party of men that were\ngot together, as were those belonging to Simon. And thus did a great and\nwild fury spread itself over the nation, because they had no king to keep\nthe multitude in good order, and because those foreigners who came to reduce\nthe seditious to sobriety did, on the contrary, set them more in a flame,\nbecause of the injuries they offered them, and the avaricious management\nof their affairs.", "But because Athronges, a person neither eminent by the dignity of\nhis progenitors, nor for any great wealth he was possessed of, but one\nthat had in all respects been a shepherd only, and was not known by any\nbody; yet because he was a tall man, and excelled others in the strength\nof his hands, he was so bold as to set up for king. This man thought it\nso sweet a thing to do more than ordinary injuries to others, that although\nhe should be killed, he did not much care if he lost his life in so great\na design. He had also four brethren, who were tall men themselves, and\nwere believed to be superior to others in the strength of their hands,\nand thereby were encouraged to aim at great things, and thought that strength\nof theirs would support them in retaining the kingdom. Each of these ruled\nover a band of men of their own; for those that got together to them were\nvery numerous. They were every one of them also commanders; but when they\ncame to fight, they were subordinate to him, and fought for him, while\nhe put a diadem about his head, and assembled a council to debate about\nwhat things should be done, and all things were done according to his pleasure.\nAnd this man retained his power a great while; he was also called king,\nand had nothing to hinder him from doing what he pleased. He also, as well\nas his brethren, slew a great many both of the Romans and of the king's\nforces, an managed matters with the like hatred to each of them. The king's\nforces they fell upon, because of the licentious conduct they had been\nallowed under Herod's government; and they fell upon the Romans, because\nof the injuries they had so lately received from them. But in process of\ntime they grew more cruel to all sorts of men, nor could any one escape\nfrom one or other of these seditions, since they slew some out of the hopes\nof gain, and others from a mere custom of slaying men. They once attacked\na company of Romans at Emmaus, who were bringing corn and weapons to the\narmy, and fell upon Arius, the centurion, who commanded the company, and\nshot forty of the best of his foot soldiers; but the rest of them were\naftrighted at their slaughter, and left their dead behind them, but saved\nthemselves by the means of Gratus, who came with the king's troops that\nwere about him to their assistance. Now these four brethren continued the\nwar a long while by such sort of expeditions, and much grieved the Romans;\nbut did their own nation also a great deal of mischief. Yet were they afterwards\nsubdued; one of them in a fight with Gratus, another with Ptolemy; Archelaus\nalso took the eldest of them prisoner; while the last of them was so dejected\nat the other's misfortune, and saw so plainly that he had no way now left\nto save himself, his army being worn away with sickness and continual labors,\nthat he also delivered himself up to Archclaus, upon his promise and oath\nto God [to preserve his life.] But these things came to pass a good while\nafterward.", "And now Judea was full of robberies; and as the several companies\nof the seditious lighted upon any one to head them, he was created a king\nimmediately, in order to do mischief to the public. They were in some small\nmeasure indeed, and in small matters, hurtful to the Romans; but the murders\nthey committed upon their own people lasted a long while.", "As soon as Varus was once informed of the state of Judea by Sabinus's\nwriting to him, he was afraid for the legion he had left there; so he took\nthe two other legions, (for there were three legions in all belonging to\nSyria,) and four troops of horsemen, with the several auxiliary forces\nwhich either the kings or certain of the tetrarchs afforded him, and made\nwhat haste he could to assist those that were then besieged in Judea. He\nalso gave order that all that were sent out for this expedition, should\nmake haste to Ptolemais. The citizens of Berytus also gave him fifteen\nhundred auxiliaries as he passed through their city. Aretas also, the king\nof Arabia Petrea, out of his hatred to Herod, and in order to purchase\nthe favor of the Romans, sent him no small assistance, besides their footmen\nand horsemen; and when he had now collected all his forces together, he\ncommitted part of them to his son, and to a friend of his, and sent them\nupon an expedition into Galilee, which lies in the neighborhood of Ptolemais;\nwho made an attack upon the enemy, and put them to flight, and took Sepphoris,\nand made its inhabitants slaves, and burnt the city. But Varus himself\npursued his march for Samaria with his whole army; yet did not he meddle\nwith the city of that name, because it had not at all joined with the seditious;\nbut pitched his camp at a certain village that belonged to Ptolemy, whose\nname was Arus, which the Arabians burnt, out of their hatred to Herod,\nand out of the enmity they bore to his friends; whence they marched to\nanother village, whose name was Sampho, which the Arabians plundered and\nburnt, although it was a fortified and a strong place; and all along this\nmarch nothing escaped them, but all places were full of fire and of slaughter.\nEmmaus was also burnt by Varus's order, after its inhabitants had deserted\nit, that he might avenge those that had there been destroyed. From thence\nhe now marched to Jerusalem; whereupon those Jews whose camp lay there,\nand who had besieged the Roman legion, not bearing the coming of this army,\nleft the siege imperfect: but as to the Jerusalem Jews, when Varus reproached\nthem bitterly for what had been done, they cleared themselves of the accusation,\nand alleged that the conflux of the people was occasioned by the feast;\nthat the war was not made with their approbation, but by the rashness of\nthe strangers, while they were on the side of the Romans, and besieged\ntogether with them, rather than having any inclination to besiege them.\nThere also came beforehand to meet Varus, Joseph, the cousin-german of\nking Herod, as also Gratus and Rufus, who brought their soldiers along\nwith them, together with those Romans who had been besieged; but Sabinus\ndid not come into Varus's presence, but stole out of the city privately,\nand went to the sea-side.", "Upon this, Varus sent a part of his army into the country, to seek\nout those that had been the authors of the revolt; and when they were discovered,\nhe punished some of them that were most guilty, and some he dismissed:\nnow the number of those that were crucified on this account were two thousand.\nAfter which he disbanded his army, which he found no way useful to him\nin the affairs he came about; for they behaved themselves very disorderly,\nand disobeyed his orders, and what Varus desired them to do, and this out\nof regard to that gain which they made by the mischief they did. As for\nhimself, when he was informed that ten thousand Jews had gotten together,\nhe made haste to catch them; but they did not proceed so far as to fight\nhim, but, by the advice of Achiabus, they came together, and delivered\nthemselves up to him: hereupon Varus forgave the crime of revolting to\nthe multitude, but sent their several commanders to Caesar, many of whom\nCaesar dismissed; but for the several relations of Herod who had been among\nthese men in this war, they were the only persons whom he punished, who,\nwithout the least regard to justice, fought against their own kindred.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "See Of the War, B.

The rest also of the king's relations\nreceived what his testament allotted them. Moreover, Caesar made a present\nto each of Herod's two virgin daughters, besides what their father left\nthem, of two hundred and fifty thousand [drachmae] of silver, and married\nthem to Pheroras's sons: he also granted all that was bequeathed to himself\nto the king's sons, which was one thousand five hundred talents, excepting\na few of the vessels, which he reserved for himself; and they were acceptable\nto him, not so much for the great value they were of, as because they were\nmemorials of the king to him.", "WHEN these affairs had been thus settled by Caesar, a certain young\nman, by birth a Jew, but brought up by a Roman freed-man in the city Sidon,\ningrafted himself into the kindred of Herod, by the resemblance of his\ncountenance, which those that saw him attested to be that of Alexander,\nthe son of Herod, whom he had slain; and this was an incitement to him\nto endeavor to obtain the government; so he took to him as an assistant\na man of his own country, (one that was well acquainted with the affairs\nof the palace, but, on other accounts, an ill man, and one whose nature\nmade him capable of causing great disturbances to the public, and one that\nbecame a teacher of such a mischievous contrivance to the other,) and declared\nhimself to be Alexander, and the son of Herod, but stolen away. by one\nof those that were sent to slay him, who, in reality, slew other men, in\norder to deceive the spectators, but saved both him and his brother Aristobulus.\nThus was this man elated, and able to impose on those that came to him;\nand when he was come to Crete, he made all the Jews that came to discourse\nwith him believe him [to be Alexander]. And when he had gotten much money\nwhich had been presented to him there, he passed over to Melos, where he\ngot much more money than he had before, out of the belief they had that\nhe was of the royal family, and their hopes that he would recover his father's\nprincipality, and reward his benefactors; so he made haste to Rome, and\nwas conducted thither by those strangers who entertained him.

Yet\ndid not he deceive Caesar; for although there was a resemblance between\nhim and Alexander, yet was it not so exact as to impose on such as were\nprudent in discerning; for this spurious Alexander had his hands rough,\nby the labors he had been put to and instead of that softness of body which\nthe other had, and this as derived from his delicate and generous education,\nthis man, for the contrary reason, had a rugged body. When, therefore,\nCaesar saw how the master and the scholar agreed in this lying story, and\nin a bold way of talking, he inquired about Aristobulus, and asked what\nbecame of him who (it seems) was stolen away together with him, and for\nwhat reason it was that he did not come along with him, and endeavor to\nrecover that dominion which was due to his high birth also. And when he\nsaid that he had been left in the isle of Crete, for fear of the dangers\nof the sea, that, in case any accident should come to himself, the posterity\nof Mariamne might not utterly perish, but that Aristobulus might survive,\nand punish those that laid such treacherous designs against them; and when\nhe persevered in his affirmations, and the author of the imposture agreed\nin supporting it, Caesar took the young man by himself, and said to him,\n\"If thou wilt not impose upon me, thou shalt have this for thy reward,\nthat thou shalt escape with thy life; tell me, then, who thou art, and\nwho it was that had boldness enough to contrive such a cheat as this. For\nthis contrivance is too considerable a piece of villainy to be undertaken\nby one of thy age.\" Accordingly, because he had no other way to take,\nhe told Caesar the contrivance, and after what manner and by whom it was\nlaid together. So Caesar, upon observing the spurious Alexander to be a\nstrong active man, and fit to work with his hands, that he might not break\nhis promise to him, put him among those that were to row among the mariners,\nbut slew him that induced him to do what he had done; for as for the people\nof Melos, he thought them sufficiently punished, in having thrown away\nso much of their money upon this spurious Alexander.

who, on other accounts, was of great dignity, came at this time into\nSyria, with a few others, being sent by Caesar to he a judge of that nation,\nand to take an account of their substance. Coponius also, a man of the\nequestrian order, was sent together with him, to have the supreme power\nover the Jews. Moreover, Cyrenius came himself into Judea, which was now\nadded to the province of Syria, to take an account of their substance,\nand to dispose of Archelaus's money; but the Jews, although at the beginning\nthey took the report of a taxation heinously, yet did they leave off any\nfurther opposition to it, by the persuasion of Joazar, who was the son\nof Beethus, and high priest; so they, being over-pesuaded by Joazar's words,\ngave an account of their estates, without any dispute about it. Yet was\nthere one Judas, a Gaulonite, \nof a city whose name was Gamala, who, taking with him Sadduc, \na Pharisee, became zealous to draw them to a revolt, who both said that\nthis taxation was no better than an introduction to slavery, and exhorted\nthe nation to assert their liberty; as if they could procure them happiness\nand security for what they possessed, and an assured enjoyment of a still\ngreater good, which was that of the honor and glory they would thereby\nacquire for magnanimity. They also said that God would not otherwise be\nassisting to them, than upon their joining with one another in such councils\nas might be successful, and for their own advantage; and this especially,\nif they would set about great exploits, and not grow weary in executing\nthe same; so men received what they said with pleasure, and this bold attempt\nproceeded to a great height. All sorts of misfortunes also sprang from\nthese men, and the nation was infected with this doctrine to an incredible\ndegree; one violent war came upon us after another, and we lost our friends\nwhich used to alleviate our pains; there were also very great robberies\nand murder of our principal men. This was done in pretense indeed for the\npublic welfare, but in reality for the hopes of gain to themselves; whence\narose seditions, and from them murders of men, which sometimes fell on\nthose of their own people, (by the madness of these men towards one another,\nwhile their desire was that none of the adverse party might be left,) and\nsometimes on their enemies; a famine also coming upon us, reduced us to\nthe last degree of despair, as did also the taking and demolishing of cities;\nnay, the sedition at last increased so high, that the very temple of God\nwas burnt down by their enemies' fire. Such were the consequences of this,\nthat the customs of our fathers were altered, and such a change was made,\nas added a mighty weight toward bringing all to destruction, which these\nmen occasioned by their thus conspiring together; for Judas and Sadduc,\nwho excited a fourth philosophic sect among us, and had a great many followers\ntherein, filled our civil government with tumults at present, and laid\nthe foundations of our future miseries, by this system of philosophy, which\nwe were before unacquainted withal, concerning which I will discourse a\nlittle, and this the rather because the infection which spread thence among\nthe younger sort, who were zealous for it, brought the public to destruction.", "The Jews had for a great while had three sects of philosophy peculiar\nto themselves; the sect of the Essens, and the sect of the Sadducees, and\nthe third sort of opinions was that of those called Pharisees; of which\nsects, although I have already spoken in the second book of the Jewish\nWar, yet will I a little touch upon them now.", "Now, for the Pharisees, they live meanly, and despise delicacies\nin diet; and they follow the conduct of reason; and what that prescribes\nto them as good for them they do; and they think they ought earnestly to\nstrive to observe reason's dictates for practice. They also pay a respect\nto such as are in years; nor are they so bold as to contradict them in\nany thing which they have introduced; and when they determine that all\nthings are done by fate, they do not take away the freedom from men of\nacting as they think fit; since their notion is, that it hath pleased God\nto make a temperament, whereby what he wills is done, but so that the will\nof man can act virtuously or viciously. They also believe that souls have\nan immortal rigor in them, and that under the earth there will be rewards\nor punishments, according as they have lived virtuously or viciously in\nthis life; and the latter are to be detained in an everlasting prison,\nbut that the former shall have power to revive and live again; on account\nof which doctrines they are able greatly to persuade the body of the people;\nand whatsoever they do about Divine worship, prayers, and sacrifices, they\nperform them according to their direction; insomuch that the cities give\ngreat attestations to them on account of their entire virtuous conduct,\nboth in the actions of their lives and their discourses also.", "But the doctrine of the Sadducees is this: That souls die with the\nbodies; nor do they regard the observation of any thing besides what the\nlaw enjoins them; for they think it an instance of virtue to dispute with\nthose teachers of philosophy whom they frequent: but this doctrine is received\nbut by a few, yet by those still of the greatest dignity. But they are\nable to do almost nothing of themselves; for when they become magistrates,\nas they are unwillingly and by force sometimes obliged to be, they addict\nthemselves to the notions of the Pharisees, because the multitude would\nnot otherwise bear them.", "The doctrine of the Essens is this: That all things are best ascribed\nto God. They teach the immortality of souls, and esteem that the rewards\nof righteousness are to be earnestly striven for; and when they send what\nthey have dedicated to God into the temple, they do not offer sacrifices\n because\nthey have more pure lustrations of their own; on which account they are\nexcluded from the common court of the temple, but offer their sacrifices\nthemselves; yet is their course of life better than that of other men;\nand they entirely addict themselves to husbandry. It also deserves our\nadmiration, how much they exceed all other men that addict themselves to\nvirtue, and this in righteousness; and indeed to such a degree, that as\nit hath never appeared among any other men, neither Greeks nor barbarians,\nno, not for a little time, so hath it endured a long while among them.\nThis is demonstrated by that institution of theirs, which will not suffer\nany thing to hinder them from having all things in common; so that a rich\nman enjoys no more of his own wealth than he who hath nothing at all. There\nare about four thousand men that live in this way, and neither marry wives,\nnor are desirous to keep servants; as thinking the latter tempts men to\nbe unjust, and the former gives the handle to domestic quarrels; but as\nthey live by themselves, they minister one to another. They also appoint\ncertain stewards to receive the incomes of their revenues, and of the fruits\nof the ground; such as are good men and priests, who are to get their corn\nand their food ready for them. They none of them differ from others of\nthe Essens in their way of living, but do the most resemble those Dacae\nwho are called Polistae \n[dwellers in cities].", "But of the fourth sect of Jewish philosophy, Judas the Galilean was\nthe author. These men agree in all other things with the Pharisaic notions;\nbut they have an inviolable attachment to liberty, and say that God is\nto be their only Ruler and Lord. They also do not value dying any kinds\nof death, nor indeed do they heed the deaths of their relations and friends,\nnor can any such fear make them call any man lord. And since this immovable\nresolution of theirs is well known to a great many, I shall speak no further\nabout that matter; nor am I afraid that any thing I have said of them should\nbe disbelieved, but rather fear, that what I have said is beneath the resolution\nthey show when they undergo pain. And it was in Gessius Florus's time that\nthe nation began to grow mad with this distemper, who was our procurator,\nand who occasioned the Jews to go wild with it by the abuse of his authority,\nand to make them revolt from the Romans. And these are the sects of Jewish\nphilosophy.", "WHEN Cyrenius had now disposed of Archelaus's money, and when the\ntaxings were come to a conclusion, which were made in the thirty-seventh\nyear of Caesar's victory over Antony at Actium, he deprived Joazar of the\nhigh priesthood, which dignity had been conferred on him by the multitude,\nand he appointed Ananus, the son of Seth, to be high priest; while Herod\nand Philip had each of them received their own tetrarchy, and settled the\naffairs thereof. Herod also built a wall about Sepphoris, (which is the\nsecurity of all Galilee,) and made it the metropolis of the country. He\nalso built a wall round Betharamphtha, which was itself a city also, and\ncalled it Julias, from the name of the emperor's wife. When Philip also\nhad built Paneas, a city at the fountains of Jordan, he named it Cesarea.\nHe also advanced the village Bethsaids, situate at the lake of Gennesareth,\nunto the dignity of a city, both by the number of inhabitants it contained,\nand its other grandeur, and called it by the name of Julias, the same name\nwith Caesar's daughter.", "As Coponius, who we told you was sent along with Cyrenius, was exercising\nhis office of procurator, and governing Judea, the following accidents\nhappened. As the Jews were celebrating the feast of unleavened bread, which\nwe call the Passover, it was customary for the priests to open the temple-gates\njust after midnight. When, therefore, those gates were first opened, some\nof the Samaritans came privately into Jerusalem, and threw about dead men's\nbodies, in the cloisters; on which account the Jews afterward excluded\nthem out of the temple, which they had not used to do at such festivals;\nand on other accounts also they watched the temple more carefully than\nthey had formerly done. A little after which accident Coponius returned\nto Rome, and Marcus Ambivius came to be his successor in that government;\nunder whom Salome, the sister of king Herod, died, and left to Julia, [Caesar's\nwife,] Jamnia, all its toparchy, and Phasaelis in the plain, and Arehelais,\nwhere is a great plantation of palm trees, and their fruit is excellent\nin its kind. After him came Annius Rufus, under whom died Caesar, the second\nemperor of the Romans, the duration of whose reign was fifty-seven years,\nbesides six months and two days (of which time Antonius ruled together\nwith him fourteen years; but the duration of his life was seventy-seven\nyears); upon whose death Tiberius Nero, his wife Julia's son, succeeded.\nHe was now the third emperor; and he sent Valerius Gratus to be procurator\nof Judea, and to succeed Annius Rufus. This man deprived Ananus of the\nhigh priesthood, and appointed Ismael, the son of Phabi, to be high priest.\nHe also deprived him in a little time, and ordained Eleazar, the son of\nAnanus, who had been high priest before, to be high priest; which office,\nwhen he had held for a year, Gratus deprived him of it, and gave the high\npriesthood to Simon, the son of Camithus; and when he had possessed that\ndignity no longer than a year, Joseph Caiaphas was made his successor.\nWhen Gratus had done those things, he went back to Rome, after he had tarried\nin Judea eleven years, when Pontius Pilate came as his successor.", "And now Herod the tetrarch, who was in great favor with Tiberius,\nbuilt a city of the same name with him, and called it Tiberias. He built\nit in the best part of Galilee, at the lake of Gennesareth. There are warm\nbaths at a little distance from it, in a village named Emmaus. Strangers\ncame and inhabited this city; a great number of the inhabitants were Galileans\nalso; and many were necessitated by Herod to come thither out of the country\nbelonging to him, and were by force compelled to be its inhabitants; some\nof them were persons of condition. He also admitted poor people, such as\nthose that were collected from all parts, to dwell in it. Nay, some of\nthem were not quite free-men, and these he was benefactor to, and made\nthem free in great numbers; but obliged them not to forsake the city, by\nbuilding them very good houses at his own expenses, and by giving them\nland also; for he was sensible, that to make this place a habitation was\nto transgress the Jewish ancient laws, because many sepulchers were to\nbe here taken away, in order to make room for the city Tiberias \nwhereas our laws pronounce that such inhabitants are unclean for seven\ndays.", "About this time died Phraates, king of the Parthians, by the treachery\nof Phraataces his son, upon the occasion following: When Phraates had had\nlegitimate sons of his own, he had also an Italian maid-servant, whose\nname was Thermusa, who had been formerly sent to him by Julius Caesar,\namong other presents. He first made her his concubine; but he being a great\nadmirer of her beauty, in process of time having a son by her, whose name\nwas Phraataces, he made her his legitimate wife, and had a great respect\nfor her. Now she was able to persuade him to do any thing that she said,\nand was earnest in procuring the government of Parthia for her son; but\nstill she saw that her endeavors would not succeed, unless she could contrive\nhow to remove Phraates's legitimate sons [out of the kingdom;] so she persuaded\nhim to send those his sons as pledges of his fidelity to Rome; and they\nwere sent to Rome accordingly, because it was not easy for him to contradict\nher commands. Now while Phraataces was alone brought up in order to succeed\nin the government, he thought it very tedious to expect that government\nby his father's donation [as his successor]; he therefore formed a treacherous\ndesign against his father, by his mother's assistance, with whom, as the\nreport went, he had criminal conversation also. So he was hated for both\nthese vices, while his subjects esteemed this [wicked] love of his mother\nto be no way inferior to his parricide; and he was by them, in a sedition,\nexpelled out of the country before he grew too great, and died. But as\nthe best sort of Parthians agreed together that it was impossible they\nshould be governed without a king, while also it was their constant practice\nto choose one of the family of Arsaces, [nor did their law allow of any\nothers; and they thought this kingdom had been sufficiently injured already\nby the marriage with an Italian concubine, and by her issue,] they sent\nambassadors, and called Orodes [to take the crown]; for the multitude would\nnot otherwise have borne them; and though he was accused of very great\ncruelty, and was of an untractable temper, and prone to wrath, yet still\nhe was one of the family of Arsaces. However, they made a conspiracy against\nhim, and slew him, and that, as some say, at a festival, and among their\nsacrifices; (for it is the universal custom there to carry their swords\nwith them;) but, as the more general report is, they slew him when they\nhad drawn him out a hunting. So they sent ambassadors to Rome, and desired\nthey would send one of those that were there as pledges to be their king.\nAccordingly, Vonones was preferred before the rest, and sent to them (for\nhe seemed capable of such great fortune, which two of the greatest kingdoms\nunder the sun now offered him, his own and a foreign one). However, the\nbarbarians soon changed their minds, they being naturally of a mutable\ndisposition, upon the supposal that this man was not worthy to be their\ngovernor; for they could not think of obeying the commands of one that\nhad been a slave, (for so they called those that had been hostages,) nor\ncould they bear the ignominy of that name; and this was the more intolerable,\nbecause then the Parthians must have such a king set over them, not by\nright of war, but in time of peace. So they presently invited Artabanus,\nking of Media, to be their king, he being also of the race of Arsaces.\nArtabanus complied with the offer that was made him, and came to them with\nan army. So Vonones met him; and at first the multitude of the Parthians\nstood on this side, and he put his army in array; but Artabanus was beaten,\nand fled to the mountains of Media. Yet did he a little after gather a\ngreat army together, and fought with Vonones, and beat him; whereupon Vonones\nfled away on horseback, with a few of his attendants about him, to Seleucia\n[upon Tigris]. So when Artabanus had slain a great number, and this after\nhe had gotten the victory by reason of the very great dismay the barbarians\nwere in, he retired to Ctesiphon with a great number of his people; and\nso he now reigned over the Parthians. But Vonones fled away to Armenia;\nand as soon as he came thither, he had an inclination to have the government\nof the country given him, and sent ambassadors to Rome [for that purpose].\nBut because Tiberius refused it him, and because he wanted courage, and\nbecause the Parthian king threatened him, and sent ambassadors to him to\ndenounce war against him if he proceeded, and because he had no way to\ntake to regain any other kingdom, (for the people of authority among the\nArmenians about Niphates joined themselves to Artabanus,) he delivered\nup himself to Silanus, the president of Syria, who, out of regard to his\neducation at Rome, kept him in Syria, while Artabanus gave Armenia to Orodes,\none of his own sons.", "At this time died Antiochus, the king of Commagene; whereupon the\nmultitude contended with the nobility, and both sent ambassadors to [Rome];\nfor the men of power were desirous that their form of government might\nbe changed into that of a [Roman] province; as were the multitude desirous\nto be under kings, as their fathers had been. So the senate made a decree\nthat Germanicus should be sent to settle the affairs of the East, fortune\nhereby taking a proper opportunity for depriving him of his life; for when\nhe had been in the East, and settled all affairs there, his life was taken\naway by the poison which Piso gave him, as hath been related elsewhere.", "BUT now Pilate, the procurator of Judea, removed the army from Cesarea\nto Jerusalem, to take their winter quarters there, in order to abolish\nthe Jewish laws. So he introduced Caesar's effigies, which were upon the\nensigns, and brought them into the city; whereas our law forbids us the\nvery making of images; on which account the former procurators were wont\nto make their entry into the city with such ensigns as had not those ornaments.\nPilate was the first who brought those images to Jerusalem, and set them\nup there; which was done without the knowledge of the people, because it\nwas done in the night time; but as soon as they knew it, they came in multitudes\nto Cesarea, and interceded with Pilate many days that he would remove the\nimages; and when he would not grant their requests, because it would tend\nto the injury of Caesar, while yet they persevered in their request, on\nthe sixth day he ordered his soldiers to have their weapons privately,\nwhile he came and sat upon his judgment-seat, which seat was so prepared\nin the open place of the city, that it concealed the army that lay ready\nto oppress them; and when the Jews petitioned him again, he gave a signal\nto the soldiers to encompass them routed, and threatened that their punishment\nshould be no less than immediate death, unless they would leave off disturbing\nhim, and go their ways home. But they threw themselves upon the ground,\nand laid their necks bare, and said they would take their death very willingly,\nrather than the wisdom of their laws should be transgressed; upon which\nPilate was deeply affected with their firm resolution to keep their laws\ninviolable, and presently commanded the images to be carried back from\nJerusalem to Cesarea.", "But Pilate undertook to bring a current of water to Jerusalem, and\ndid it with the sacred money, and derived the origin of the stream from\nthe distance of two hundred furlongs. However, the Jews \nwere not pleased with what had been done about this water; and many ten\nthousands of the people got together, and made a clamor against him, and\ninsisted that he should leave off that design. Some of them also used reproaches,\nand abused the man, as crowds of such people usually do. So he habited\na great number of his soldiers in their habit, who carried daggers under\ntheir garments, and sent them to a place where they might surround them.\nSo he bid the Jews himself go away; but they boldly casting reproaches\nupon him, he gave the soldiers that signal which had been beforehand agreed\non; who laid upon them much greater blows than Pilate had commanded them,\nand equally punished those that were tumultuous, and those that were not;\nnor did they spare them in the least: and since the people were unarmed,\nand were caught by men prepared for what they were about, there were a\ngreat number of them slain by this means, and others of them ran away wounded.\nAnd thus an end was put to this sedition.", "Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful\nto call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such\nmen as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of\nthe Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate,\nat the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to\nthe cross, \nthose that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared\nto them alive again the third day; \nas the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful\nthings concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him,\nare not extinct at this day.", "About the same time also another sad calamity put the Jews into disorder,\nand certain shameful practices happened about the temple of Isis that was\nat Rome. I will now first take notice of the wicked attempt about the temple\nof Isis, and will then give an account of the Jewish affairs. There was\nat Rome a woman whose name was Paulina; one who, on account of the dignity\nof her ancestors, and by the regular conduct of a virtuous life, had a\ngreat reputation: she was also very rich; and although she was of a beautiful\ncountenance, and in that flower of her age wherein women are the most gay,\nyet did she lead a life of great modesty. She was married to Saturninus,\none that was every way answerable to her in an excellent character. Decius\nMundus fell in love with this woman, who was a man very high in the equestrian\norder; and as she was of too great dignity to be caught by presents, and\nhad already rejected them, though they had been sent in great abundance,\nhe was still more inflamed with love to her, insomuch that he promised\nto give her two hundred thousand Attic drachmae for one night's lodging;\nand when this would not prevail upon her, and he was not able to bear this\nmisfortune in his amours, he thought it the best way to famish himself\nto death for want of food, on account of Paulina's sad refusal; and he\ndetermined with himself to die after such a manner, and he went on with\nhis purpose accordingly. Now Mundus had a freed-woman, who had been made\nfree by his father, whose name was Ide, one skillful in all sorts of mischief.\nThis woman was very much grieved at the young man's resolution to kill\nhimself, (for he did not conceal his intentions to destroy himself from\nothers,) and came to him, and encouraged him by her discourse, and made\nhim to hope, by some promises she gave him, that he might obtain a night's\nlodging with Paulina; and when he joyfully hearkened to her entreaty, she\nsaid she wanted no more than fifty thousand drachmae for the entrapping\nof the woman. So when she had encouraged the young man, and gotten as much\nmoney as she required, she did not take the same methods as had been taken\nbefore, because she perceived that the woman was by no means to be tempted\nby money; but as she knew that she was very much given to the worship of\nthe goddess Isis, she devised the following stratagem: She went to some\nof Isis's priests, and upon the strongest assurances [of concealment],\nshe persuaded them by words, but chiefly by the offer of money, of twenty-five\nthousand drachmae in hand, and as much more when the thing had taken effect;\nand told them the passion of the young man, and persuaded them to use all\nmeans possible to beguile the woman. So they were drawn in to promise so\nto do, by that large sum of gold they were to have. Accordingly, the oldest\nof them went immediately to Paulina; and upon his admittance, he desired\nto speak with her by herself. When that was granted him, he told her that\nhe was sent by the god Anubis, who was fallen in love with her, and enjoined\nher to come to him. Upon this she took the message very kindly, and valued\nherself greatly upon this condescension of Anubis, and told her husband\nthat she had a message sent her, and was to sup and lie with Anubis; so\nhe agreed to her acceptance of the offer, as fully satisfied with the chastity\nof his wife. Accordingly, she went to the temple, and after she had supped\nthere, and it was the hour to go to sleep, the priest shut the doors of\nthe temple, when, in the holy part of it, the lights were also put out.\nThen did Mundus leap out, (for he was hidden therein,) and did not fail\nof enjoying her, who was at his service all the night long, as supposing\nhe was the god; and when he was gone away, which was before those priests\nwho knew nothing of this stratagem were stirring, Paulina came early to\nher husband, and told him how the god Anubis had appeared to her. Among\nher friends, also, she declared how great a value she put upon this favor,\nwho partly disbelieved the thing, when they reflected on its nature, and\npartly were amazed at it, as having no pretense for not believing it, when\nthey considered the modesty and the dignity of the person. But now, on\nthe third day after what had been done, Mundus met Paulina, and said, \"Nay,\nPaulina, thou hast saved me two hundred thousand drachmae, which sum thou\nsightest have added to thy own family; yet hast thou not failed to be at\nmy service in the manner I invited thee. As for the reproaches thou hast\nlaid upon Mundus, I value not the business of names; but I rejoice in the\npleasure I reaped by what I did, while I took to myself the name of Anubis.\"\nWhen he had said this, he went his way. But now she began to come to the\nsense of the grossness of what she had done, and rent her garments, and\ntold her husband of the horrid nature of this wicked contrivance, and prayed\nhim not to neglect to assist her in this case. So he discovered the fact\nto the emperor; whereupon Tiberius inquired into the matter thoroughly\nby examining the priests about it, and ordered them to be crucified, as\nwell as Ide, who was the occasion of their perdition, and who had contrived\nthe whole matter, which was so injurious to the woman. He also demolished\nthe temple of Isis, and gave order that her statue should be thrown into\nthe river Tiber; while he only banished Mundus, but did no more to him,\nbecause he supposed that what crime he had committed was done out of the\npassion of love. And these were the circumstances which concerned the temple\nof Isis, and the injuries occasioned by her priests. I now return to the\nrelation of what happened about this time to the Jews at Rome, as I formerly\ntold you I would.", "There was a man who was a Jew, but had been driven away from his\nown country by an accusation laid against him for transgressing their laws,\nand by the fear he was under of punishment for the same; but in all respects\na wicked man. He, then living at Rome, professed to instruct men in the\nwisdom of the laws of Moses. He procured also three other men, entirely\nof the same character with himself, to be his partners. These men persuaded\nFulvia, a woman of great dignity, and one that had embraced the Jewish\nreligion, to send purple and gold to the temple at Jerusalem; and when\nthey had gotten them, they employed them for their own uses, and spent\nthe money themselves, on which account it was that they at first required\nit of her. Whereupon Tiberius, who had been informed of the thing by Saturninus,\nthe husband of Fulvia, who desired inquiry might be made about it, ordered\nall the Jews to be banished out of Rome; at which time the consuls listed\nfour thousand men out of them, and sent them to the island Sardinia; but\npunished a greater number of them, who were unwilling to become soldiers,\non account of keeping the laws of their forefathers. \nThus were these Jews banished out of the city by the wickedness of four\nmen.", "BUT the nation of the Samaritans did not escape without tumults.\nThe man who excited them to it was one who thought lying a thing of little\nconsequence, and who contrived every thing so that the multitude might\nbe pleased; so he bid them to get together upon Mount Gerizzim, which is\nby them looked upon as the most holy of all mountains, and assured them,\nthat when they were come thither, he would show them those sacred vessels\nwhich were laid under that place, because Moses put them there \nSo they came thither armed, and thought the discourse of the man probable;\nand as they abode at a certain village, which was called Tirathaba, they\ngot the rest together to them, and desired to go up the mountain in a great\nmultitude together; but Pilate prevented their going up, by seizing upon\nfile roads with a great band of horsemen and foot-men, who fell upon those\nthat were gotten together in the village; and when it came to an action,\nsome of them they slew, and others of them they put to flight, and took\na great many alive, the principal of which, and also the most potent of\nthose that fled away, Pilate ordered to be slain.", "But when this tumult was appeased, the Samaritan senate sent an embassy\nto Vitellius, a man that had been consul, and who was now president of\nSyria, and accused Pilate of the murder of those that were killed; for\nthat they did not go to Tirathaba in order to revolt from the Romans, but\nto escape the violence of Pilate. So Vitellius sent Marcellus, a friend\nof his, to take care of the affairs of Judea, and ordered Pilate to go\nto Rome, to answer before the emperor to the accusations of the Jews. So\nPilate, when he had tarried ten years in Judea, made haste to Rome, and\nthis in obedience to the orders of Vitellius, which he durst not contradict;\nbut before he could get to Rome Tiberius was dead.", "But Vitellius came into Judea, and went up to Jerusalem; it was at\nthe time of that festival which is called the Passover. Vitellius was there\nmagnificently received, and released the inhabitants of Jerusalem from\nall the taxes upon the fruits that were bought and sold, and gave them\nleave to have the care of the high priest's vestments, with all their ornaments,\nand to have them under the custody of the priests in the temple, which\npower they used to have formerly, although at this time they were laid\nup in the tower of Antonia, the citadel so called, and that on the occasion\nfollowing: There was one of the [high] priests, named Hyrcanus; and as\nthere were many of that name, he was the first of them; this man built\na tower near the temple, and when he had so done, he generally dwelt in\nit, and had these vestments with him, because it was lawful for him alone\nto put them on, and he had them there reposited when he went down into\nthe city, and took his ordinary garments; the same things were continued\nto be done by his sons, and by their sons after them. But when Herod came\nto be king, he rebuilt this tower, which was very conveniently situated,\nin a magnificent manner; and because he was a friend to Antonius, he called\nit by the name of Antonia. And as he found these vestments lying there,\nhe retained them in the same place, as believing, that while he had them\nin his custody, the people would make no innovations against him. The like\nto what Herod did was done by his son Archelaus, who was made king after\nhim; after whom the Romans, when they entered on the government, took possession\nof these vestments of the high priest, and had them reposited in a stone-chamber,\nunder the seal of the priests, and of the keepers of the temple, the captain\nof the guard lighting a lamp there every day; and seven days before a festival\n\nthey were delivered to them by the captain of the guard, when the high\npriest having purified them, and made use of them, laid them up again in\nthe same chamber where they had been laid up before, and this the very\nnext day after the feast was over. This was the practice at the three yearly\nfestivals, and on the fast day; but Vitellius put those garments into our\nown power, as in the days of our forefathers, and ordered the captain of\nthe guard not to trouble himself to inquire where they were laid, or when\nthey were to be used; and this he did as an act of kindness, to oblige\nthe nation to him. Besides which, he also deprived Joseph, who was also\ncalled Caiaphas, of the high priesthood, and appointed Jonathan the son\nof Ananus, the former high priest, to succeed him. After which, he took\nhis journey back to Antioch.", "Moreover, Tiberius sent a letter to Vitellius, and commanded him\nto make a league of friendship with Artabanus, the king of Parthia; for\nwhile he was his enemy, he terrified him, because he had taken Armenia\naway from him, lest he should proceed further, and told him he should no\notherwise trust him than upon his giving him hostages, and especially his\nson Artabanus. Upon Tiberius's writing thus to Vitellius, by the offer\nof great presents of money, he persuaded both the king of Iberia and the\nking of Albania to make no delay, but to fight against Artabanus; and although\nthey would not do it themselves, yet did they give the Scythians a passage\nthrough their country, and opened the Caspian gates to them, and brought\nthem upon Artabanus. So Armenia was again taken from the Parthians, and\nthe country of Parthis was filled with war, and the principal of their\nmen were slain, and all things were in disorder among them: the king's\nson also himself fell in these wars, together with. many ten thousands\nof his army. Vitellius had also sent such great sums of money to Artabanus's\nfather's kinsmen and friends, that he had almost procured him to be slain\nby the means of those bribes which they had taken. And when Artabanus perceived\nthat the plot laid against him was not to be avoided, because it was laid\nby the principal men, and those a great many in number, and that it would\ncertainly take effect,  when he had estimated the number of those that\nwere truly faithful to him, as also of those who were already corrupted,\nbut were deceitful in the kindness they professed to him, and were likely,\nupon trial, to go over to his enemies, he made his escape to the upper\nprovinces, where he afterwards raised a great army out of the Dahae and\nSacre, and fought with his enemies, and retained his principality.", "When Tiberius had heard of these things, he desired to have a league\nof friendship made between him and Artabanus; and when, upon this invitation,\nhe received the proposal kindly, Artabanus and Vitellius went to Euphrates,\nand as a bridge was laid over the river, they each of them came with their\nguards about them, and met one another on the midst of the bridge. And\nwhen they had agreed upon the terms of peace Herod, the tetrarch erected\na rich tent on the midst of the passage, and made them a feast there. Artabanus\nalso, not long afterward, sent his son Darius as an hostage, with many\npresents, among which there was a man seven cubits tall, a Jew he was by\nbirth, and his name was Eleazar, who, for his tallness, was called a giant.\nAfter which Vitellius went to Antioch, and Artabanus to Babylon; but Herod\n[the tetrarch] being desirous to give Caesar the first information that\nthey had obtained hostages, sent posts with letters, wherein he had accurately\ndescribed all the particulars, and had left nothing for the consular Vitellius\nto inform him of. But when Vitellius's letters were sent, and Caesar had\nlet him know that he was acquainted with the affairs already, because Herod\nhad given him an account of them before, Vitellius was very much troubled\nat it; and supposing that he had been thereby a greater sufferer than he\nreally was, he kept up a secret anger upon this occasion, till he could\nbe revenged on him, which he was after Caius had taken the government.", "About this time it was that Philip, Herod's ' brother, departed this\nlife, in the twentieth year of the reign of Tiberius, \nafter he had been tetrarch of Trachonitis and Gaulanitis, and of the nation\nof the Bataneans also, thirty-seven years. He had showed himself a person\nof moderation and quietness in the conduct of his life and government;\nhe constantly lived in that country which was subject to him; he used to\nmake his progress with a few chosen friends; his tribunal also, on which\nhe sat in judgment, followed him in his progress; and when any one met\nhim who wanted his assistance, he made no delay, but had his tribunal set\ndown immediately, wheresoever he happened to be, and sat down upon it,\nand heard his complaint: he there ordered the guilty that were convicted\nto be punished, and absolved those that had been accused unjustly. He died\nat Julias; and when he was carried to that monument which he had already\nerected for himself beforehand, he was buried with great pomp. His principality\nTiberius took, (for he left no sons behind him,) and added it to the province\nof Syria, but gave order that the tributes which arose from it should be\ncollected, and laid up in his tetrachy.", "ABOUT this time Aretas (the king of Arabia Petres) and Herod had\na quarrel on the account following: Herod the tetrarch had, married the\ndaughter of Aretas, and had lived with her a great while; but when he was\nonce at Rome, he lodged with Herod, \nwho was his brother indeed, but not by the same mother; for this Herod\nwas the son of the high priest Sireoh's daughter. However, he fell in love\nwith Herodias, this last Herod's wife, who was the daughter of Aristobulus\ntheir brother, and the sister of Agrippa the Great. This man ventured to\ntalk to her about a marriage between them; which address, when she admitted,\nan agreement was made for her to change her habitation, and come to him\nas soon as he should return from Rome: one article of this marriage also\nwas this, that he should divorce Aretas's daughter. So Antipus, when he\nhad made this agreement, sailed to Rome; but when he had done there the\nbusiness he went about, and was returned again, his wife having discovered\nthe agreement he had made with Herodias, and having learned it before he\nhad notice of her knowledge of the whole design, she desired him to send\nher to Macherus, which is a place in the borders of the dominions of Aretas\nand Herod, without informing him of any of her intentions. Accordingly\nHerod sent her thither, as thinking his wife had not perceived any thing;\nnow she had sent a good while before to Macherus, which was subject to\nher father and so all things necessary for her journey were made ready\nfor her by the general of Aretas's army; and by that means she soon came\ninto Arabia, under the conduct of the several generals, who carried her\nfrom one to another successively; and she soon came to her father, and\ntold him of Herod's intentions. So Aretas made this the first occasion\nof his enmity between him and Herod, who had also some quarrel with him\nabout their limits at the country of Gamalitis. So they raised armies on\nboth sides, and prepared for war, and sent their generals to fight instead\nof themselves; and when they had joined battle, all Herod's army was destroyed\nby the treachery of some fugitives, who, though they were of the tetrarchy\nof Philip, joined with Aretas's army.. So Herod wrote about these affairs\nto Tiberius, who being very angry at the attempt made by Aretas, wrote\nto Vitellius to make war upon him, and either to take him alive, and bring\nhim to him in bonds, or to kill him, and send him his head. This was the\ncharge that Tiberius gave to the president of Syria.", "Now some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's army\ncame from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against\nJohn, that was called the Baptist: for Herod slew him, who was a good man,\nand commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to righteousness towards\none another, and piety towards God, and so to come to baptism; for that\nthe washing [with water] would be acceptable to him, if they made use of\nit, not in order to the putting away [or the remission] of some sins [only],\nbut for the purification of the body; supposing still that the soul was\nthoroughly purified beforehand by righteousness. Now when [many] others\ncame in crowds about him, for they were very greatly moved [or pleased]\nby hearing his words, Herod, who feared lest the great influence John had\nover the people might put it into his power and inclination to raise a\nrebellion, (for they seemed ready to do any thing he should advise,) thought\nit best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause,\nand not bring himself into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make\nhim repent of it when it would be too late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner,\nout of Herod's suspicious temper, to Macherus, the castle I before mentioned,\nand was there put to death. Now the Jews had an opinion that the destruction\nof this army was sent as a punishment upon Herod, and a mark of God's displeasure\nto him.", "So Vitellius prepared to make war with Aretas, having with him two\nlegions of armed men; he also took with him all those of light armature,\nand of the horsemen which belonged to them, and were drawn out of those\nkingdoms which were under the Romans, and made haste for Petra, and came\nto Ptolemais. But as he was marching very busily, and leading his army\nthrough Judea, the principal men met him, and desired that he would not\nthus march through their land; for that the laws of their country would\nnot permit them to overlook those images which were brought into it, of\nwhich there were a great many in their ensigns; so he was persuaded by\nwhat they said, and changed that resolution of his which he had before\ntaken in this matter. Whereupon he ordered the army to march along\nthe great plain, while he himself, with Herod the tetrarch and his friends,\nwent up to Jerusalem to offer sacrifice to God, an ancient festival of\nthe Jews being then just approaching; and when he had been there, and been\nhonorably entertained by the multitude of the Jews, he made a stay there\nfor three days, within which time he deprived Jonathan of the high priesthood,\nand gave it to his brother Theophilus. But when on the fourth day letters\ncame to him, which informed him of the death of Tiberius, he obliged the\nmultitude to take an oath of fidelity to Caius; he also recalled his army,\nand made them every one go home, and take their winter quarters there,\nsince, upon the devolution of the empire upon Caius, he had not the like\nauthority of making this war which he had before. It was also reported,\nthat when Aretas heard of the coming of Vitellius to fight him, he said,\nupon his consulting the diviners, that it was impossible that this army\nof Vitellius's could enter Petra; for that one of the rulers would die,\neither he that gave orders for the war, or he that was marching at the\nother's desire, in order to be subservient to his will, or else he against\nwhom this army is prepared. So Vitellius truly retired to Antioch; but\nAgrippa, the son of Aristobulus, went up to Rome, a year before the death\nof Tiberius, in order to treat of some affairs with the emperor, if he\nmight be permitted so to do. I have now a mind to describe Herod and his\nfamily, how it fared with them, partly because it is suitable to this history\nto speak of that matter, and partly because this thing is a demonstration\nof the interposition of Providence, how a multitude of children is of no\nadvantage, no more than any other strength that mankind set their hearts\nupon, besides those acts of piety which are done towards God; for it happened,\nthat, within the revolution of a hundred years, the posterity of Herod,\nwhich were a great many in number, were, excepting a few, utterly destroyed.\n\nOne may well apply this for the instruction of mankind, and learn thence\nhow unhappy they were: it will also show us the history of Agrippa, who,\nas he was a person most worthy of admiration, so was he from a private\nman, beyond all the expectation of those that knew him, advanced to great\npower and authority. I have said something of them formerly, but I shall\nnow also speak accurately about them.", "Herod the Great had two daughters by Mariamne, the [grand] daughter\nof Hyrcanus; the one was Salampsio, who was married to Phasaelus, her first\ncousin, who was himself the son of Phasaelus, Herod's brother, her father\nmaking the match; the other was Cypros, who was herself married also to\nher first cousin Antipater, the son of Salome, Herod's sister. Phasaelus\nhad five children by Salampsio; Antipater, Herod, and Alexander, and two\ndaughters, Alexandra and Cypros; which last Agrippa, the son of Aristobulus,\nmarried; and Timius of Cyprus married Alexandra; he was a man of note,\nbut had by her no children. Agrippa had by Cypros two sons and three daughters,\nwhich daughters were named Bernice, Mariarune, and Drusius; but the names\nof the sons were Agrippa and Drusus, of which Drusus died before he came\nto the years of puberty; but their father, Agrippa, was brought up with\nhis other brethren, Herod and Aristobulus, for these were also the sons\nof the son of Herod the Great by Bernice; but Bernice was the daughter\nof Costobarus and of Salome, who was Herod's sister. Aristobulus left these\ninfants when he was slain by his father, together with his brother Alexander,\nas we have already related. But when they were arrived at years of puberty,\nthis Herod, the brother of Agrippa, married Mariamne, the daughter of Olympias,\nwho was the daughter of Herod the king, and of Joseph, the son of Joseph,\nwho was brother to Herod the king, and had by her a son, Aristobulus; but\nAristobulus, the third brother of Agrippa, married Jotape, the daughter\nof Sampsigeramus, king of Emesa; they had a daughter who was deaf, whose\nname also was Jotape; and these hitherto were the children of the male\nline. But Herodias, their sister, was married to Herod [Philip], the son\nof Herod the Great, who was born of Mariamne, the daughter of Simon the\nhigh priest, who had a daughter, Salome; after whose birth Herodias took\nupon her to confound the laws of our country, and divorced herself from\nher husband while he was alive, and was married to Herod [Antipas], her\nhusband's brother by the father's side, he was tetrarch of Galilee; but\nher daughter Salome was married to Philip, the son of Herod, and tetrarch\nof Trachonitis; and as he died childless, Aristobulus, the son of Herod,\nthe brother of Agrippa, married her; they had three sons, Herod, Agrippa,\nand Aristobulus; and this was the posterity of Phasaelus and Salampsio.\nBut the daughter of Antipater by Cypros was Cypros, whom Alexas Selcias,\nthe son of Alexas, married; they had a daughter, Cypros; but Herod and\nAlexander, who, as we told you, were the brothers of Antipater, died childless.\nAs to Alexander, the son of Herod the king, who was slain by his father,\nhe had two sons, Alexander and Tigranes, by the daughter of Archelaus,\nking of Cappadocia. Tigranes, who was king of Armenia, was accused at Rome,\nand died childless; Alexander had ason of the same name with his brother\nTigranes, and was sent to take possession of the kingdom of Armenia by\nNero; he had a son, Alexander, who married Jotape, \nthe daughter of Antiochus, the king of Commagena; Vespasian made him king\nof an island in Cilicia. But these descendants of Alexander, soon after\ntheir birth, deserted the Jewish religion, and went over to that of the\nGreeks. But for the rest of the daughters of Herod the king, it happened\nthat they died childless. And as these descendants of Herod, whom we have\nenumerated, were in being at the same time that Agrippa the Great took\nthe kingdom, and I have now given an account of them, it now remains that\nI relate the several hard fortunes which befell Agrippa, and how he got\nclear of them, and was advanced to the greatest height of dignity and power.", "A LITTLE before the death of Herod the king, Agrippa lived at Rome,\nand was generally brought up and conversed with Drusus, the emperor Tiberius's\nson, and contracted a friendship with Antonia, the wife of Drusus the Great,\nwho had his mother Bernice in great esteem, and was very desirous of advancing\nher son. Now as Agrippa was by nature magnanimous and generous in the presents\nhe made, while his mother was alive, this inclination of his mind did not\nappear, that he might be able to avoid her anger for such his extravagance;\nbut when Bernice was dead, and he was left to his own conduct, he spent\na great deal extravagantly in his daily way of living, and a great deal\nin the immoderate presents he made, and those chiefly among Caesar's freed-men,\nin order to gain their assistance, insomuch that he was, in a little time,\nreduced to poverty, and could not live at Rome any longer. Tiberius also\nforbade the friends of his deceased son to come into his sight, because\non seeing them he should be put in mind of his son, and his grief would\nthereby be revived.", "For these reasons he went away from Rome, and sailed to Judea, but\nin evil circumstances, being dejected with the loss of that money which\nhe once had, and because he had not wherewithal to pay his creditors, who\nwere many in number, and such as gave him no room for escaping them. Whereupon\nhe knew not what to do; so, for shame of his present condition, he retired\nto a certain tower, at Malatha, in Idumea, and had thoughts of killing\nhimself; but his wife Cypros perceived his intentions, and tried all sorts\nof methods to divert him from his taking such a course; so she sent a letter\nto his sister Herodias, who was now the wife of Herod the tetrarch, and\nlet her know Agrippa's present design, and what necessity it was which\ndrove him thereto, and desired her, as a kinswoman of his, to give him\nher help, and to engage her husband to do the same, since she saw how she\nalleviated these her husband's troubles all she could, although she had\nnot the like wealth to do it withal. So they sent for him, and allotted\nhim Tiberias for his habitation, and appointed him some income of money\nfor his maintenance, and made him a magistrate of that city, by way of\nhonor to him. Yet did not Herod long continue in that resolution of supporting\nhim, though even that support was not sufficient for him; for as once they\nwere at a feast at Tyre, and in their cups, and reproaches were cast upon\none another, Agrippa thought that was not to be borne, while Herod hit\nhim in the teeth with his poverty, and with his owing his necessary food\nto him. So he went to Flaccus, one that had been consul, and had been a\nvery great friend to him at Rome formerly, and was now president of Syria.", "Hereupon Flaccus received him kindly, and he lived with him. Flaccus\nhad also with him there Aristobulus, who was indeed Agrippa's brother,\nbut was at variance with him; yet did not their enmity to one another hinder\nthe friendship of Flaccus to them both, but still they were honorably treated\nby him. However, Aristobulus did not abate of his ill-will to Agrippa,\ntill at length he brought him into ill terms with Flaccus; the occasion\nof bringing on which estrangement was this: The Damascens were at difference\nwith the Sidonians about their limits, and when Flaccus was about to hear\nthe cause between them, they understood that Agrippa had a mighty influence\nupon him; so they desired that he would be of their side, and for that\nfavor promised him a great deal of money; so he was zealous in assisting\nthe Damascens as far as he was able. Now Aristobulus had gotten intelligence\nof this promise of money to him, and accused him to Flaccus of the same;\nand when, upon a thorough examination of the matter, it appeared plainly\nso to be, he rejected Agrippa out of the number of his friends. So he was\nreduced to the utmost necessity, and came to Ptolemais; and because he\nknew not where else to get a livelihood, he thought to sail to Italy; but\nas he was restrained from so doing by want of money, he desired Marsyas,\nwho was his freed-man, to find some method for procuring him so much as\nhe wanted for that purpose, by borrowing such a sum of some person or other.\nSo Marsyas desired of Peter, who was the freed-man of Bernice, Agrippa's\nmother, and by the right of her testament was bequeathed to Antonia, to\nlend so much upon Agrippa's own bond and security; but he accused Agrippa\nof having defrauded him of certain sums of money, and so obliged Marsyas,\nwhen he made the bond of twenty thousand Attic drachmae, to accept of twenty-five\nhundred drachma as \nless than what he desired, which the other allowed of, because he could\nnot help it. Upon the receipt of this money, Agrippa came to Anthedon,\nand took shipping, and was going to set sail; but Herennius Capito, who\nwas the procurator of Jamhis, sent a band of soldiers to demand of him\nthree hundred thousand drachmae of silver, which were by him owing to Caesar's\ntreasury while he was at Rome, and so forced him to stay. He then pretended\nthat he would do as he bid him; but when night came on, he cut his cables,\nand went off, and sailed to Alexandria, where he desired Alexander the\nalabarch \nto lend him two hundred thousand drachmae; but he said he would not lend\nit to him, but would not refuse it to Cypros, as greatly astonished at\nher affection to her husband, and at the other instances of her virtue;\nso she undertook to repay it. Accordingly, Alexander paid them five talents\nat Alexandria, and promised to pay them the rest of that sum at Dicearchia\n[Puteoli]; and this he did out of the fear he was in that Agrippa would\nsoon spend it. So this Cypros set her husband free, and dismissed him to\ngo on with his navigation to Italy, while she and her children departed\nfor Judea.", "And now Agrippa was come to Puteoli, whence he wrote a letter to\nTiberius Caesar, who then lived at Capreae, and told him that he was come\nso far in order to wait on him, and to pay him a visit; and desired that\nhe would give him leave to come over to Caprein: so Tiberius made no difficulty,\nbut wrote to him in an obliging way in other respects; and withal told\nhim he was glad of his safe return, and desired him to come to Capreae;\nand when he was come, he did not fail to treat him as kindly as he had\npromised him in his letter to do. But the next day came a letter to Caesar\nfrom Herennius Capito, to inform him that Agrippa had borrowed three hundred\nthousand drachmae, and not pad it at the time appointed; but when it was\ndemanded of him, he ran away like a fugitive, out of the places under his\ngovernment, and put it out of his power to get the money of him. When Caesar\nhad read this letter, he was much troubled at it, and gave order that Agrippa\nshould be excluded from his presence until he had paid that debt: upon\nwhich he was no way daunted at Caesar's anger, but entreated Antonia, the\nmother of Germanicus, and of Claudius, who was afterward Caesar himself,\nto lend him those three hundred thousand drachmae, that he might not be\ndeprived of Tiberius's friendship; so, out of regard to the memory of Bernice\nhis mother, (for those two women were very familiar with one another,)\nand out of regard to his and Claudius's education together, she lent him\nthe money; and, upon the payment of this debt, there was nothing to hinder\nTiberius's friendship to him. After this, Tiberius Caesar recommended to\nhim his grandson, \nand ordered that he should always accompany him when he went abroad. But\nupon Agrippa's kind reception by Antonia, he betook him to pay his respects\nto Caius, who was her grandson, and in very high reputation by reason of\nthe good-will they bare his father. Now there was one Thallus, a freed-man\nof Caesar, of whom he borrowed a million of drachmae, and thence repaid\nAntonia the debt he owed her; and by sending the overplus in paying his\ncourt to Caius, became a person of great authority with him.", "Now as the friendship which Agrippa had for Caius was come to a great\nheight, there happened some words to pass between them, as they once were\nin a chariot together, concerning Tiberius; Agrippa praying [to God] (for\nthey two sat by themselves) that Tiberius might soon go off the stage,\nand leave the government to Caius, who was in every respect more worthy\nof it. Now Eutychus, who was Agrippa's freed-man, and drove his chariot,\nheard these words, and at that time said nothing of them; but when Agrippa\naccused him of stealing some garments of his, (which was certainly true,)\nhe ran away from him; but when he was caught, and brought before Piso,\nwho was governor of the city, and the man was asked why he ran away, be\nreplied, that he had somewhat to say to Caesar, that tended to his security\nand preservation: so Piso bound him, and sent him to Capreae. But Tiberius,\naccording to his usual custom, kept him still in bonds, being a delayer\nof affairs, if ever there was any other king or tyrant that was so; for\nhe did not admit ambassadors quickly, and no successors were despatched\naway to governors or procurators of the provinces that had been formerly\nsent, unless they were dead; whence it was that he was so negligent in\nhearing the causes of prisoners; insomuch that when he was asked by his\nfriends what was the reason of his delay in such cases, he said that he\ndelayed to hear ambassadors, lest, upon their quick dismission, other ambassadors\nshould be appointed, and return upon him; and so he should bring trouble\nupon himself in their public reception and dismission: that he permitted\nthose governors who had been sent once to their government [to stay there\na long while], out of regard to the subjects that were under them; for\nthat all governors are naturally disposed to get as much as they can; and\nthat those who are not to fix there, but to stay a short time, and that\nat an uncertainty when they shall be turned out, do the more severely hurry\nthemselves on to fleece the people; but that if their government be long\ncontinued to them; they are at last satiated with the spoils, as having\ngotten a vast deal, and so become at length less sharp in their pillaging;\nbut that if successors are sent quickly, the poor subjects, who are exposed\nto them as a prey, will not be able to bear the new ones, while they shall\nnot have the same time allowed them wherein their predecessors had filled\nthemselves, and so grew more unconcerned about getting more; and this because\nthey are removed before they have had time [for their oppressions]. He\ngave them an example to show his meaning: A great number of flies came\nabout the sore places of a man that had been wounded; upon which one of\nthe standers-by pitied the man's misfortune, and thinking he was not able\nto drive those flies away himself, was going to drive them away for him;\nbut he prayed him to let them alone: the other, by way of reply, asked\nhim the reason of such a preposterous proceeding, in preventing relief\nfrom his present misery; to which he answered, \"If thou drivest these\nflies away, thou wilt hurt me worse; for as these are already full of my\nblood, they do not crowd about me, nor pain me so much as before, but are\nsomewhat more remiss, while the fresh ones that come almost famished, and\nfind me quite tired down already, will be my destruction. For this cause,\ntherefore, it is that I am myself careful not to send such new governors\nperpetually to those my subjects, who are already sufficiently harassed\nby many oppressions, as may, like these flies, further distress them; and\nso, besides their natural desire of gain, may have this additional incitement\nto it, that they expect to be suddenly deprived of that pleasure which\nthey take in it.\" And, as a further attestation to what I say of the\ndilatory nature of Tiberius, I appeal to this his practice itself; for\nalthough he was emperor twenty-two years, he sent in all but two procurators\nto govern the nation of the Jews, Gratus, and his successor in the government,\nPilate. Nor was he in one way of acting with respect to the Jews, and in\nanother with respect to the rest of his subjects. He further informed them,\nthat even in the hearing of the causes of prisoners, he made such delays,\nbecause immediate death to those that must be condemned to die would be\nan alleviation of their present miseries, while those wicked wretches have\nnot deserved any such favor; \"but I do it, that, by being harassed\nwith the present calamity, they may undergo greater misery.\"", "On this account it was that Eutychus could not obtain a bearing,\nbut was kept still in prison. However, some time afterward, Tiberius came\nfrom Capreae to Tusculanum, which is about a hundred furlongs from Rome.\nAgrippa then desired of Antonia that she would procure a hearing for Eutychus,\nlet the matter whereof he accused him prove what it would. Now Antonia\nwas greatly esteemed by Tiberius on all accounts, from the dignity of her\nrelation to him, who had been his brother Drusus's wife, and from her eminent\nchastity; \nfor though she was still a young woman, she continued in her widowhood,\nand refused all other matches, although Augustus had enjoined her to be\nmarried to somebody else; yet did she all along preserve her reputation\nfree from reproach. She had also been the greatest benefactress to Tiberius,\nwhen there was a very dangerous plot laid against him by Sejanus, a man\nwho had been her husband's friend, and wire had the greatest authority,\nbecause he was general of the army, and when many members of the senate\nand many of the freed-men joined with him, and the soldiery was corrupted,\nand the plot was come to a great height. Now Sejanus had certainly gained\nhis point, had not Antonia's boldness been more wisely conducted than Sejanus's\nmalice; for when she had discovered his designs against Tiberius, she wrote\nhim an exact account of the whole, and gave the letter to Pallas, the most\nfaithful of her servants, and sent him to Caprere to Tiberius, who, when\nhe understood it, slew Sejanus and his confederates; so that Tiberius,\nwho had her in great esteem before, now looked upon her with still greater\nrespect, and depended upon her in all things. So when Tiberius was desired\nby this Antonia to examine Eutychus, he answered, \"If indeed Eutychus\nhath falsely accused Agrippa in what he hath said of him, he hath had sufficient\npunishment by what I have done to him already; but if, upon examination,\nthe accusation appears to be true, let Agrippa have a care, lest, out of\ndesire of punishing his freed-man, he do not rather bring a punishment\nupon himself.\" Now when Antonia told Agrippa of this, he was still\nmuch more pressing that the matter might be examined into; so Antonia,\nupon Agrippa's lying hard at her continually to beg this favor, took the\nfollowing opportunity: As Tiberius lay once at his ease upon his sedan,\nand was carried about, and Caius, her grandson, and Agrippa, were before\nhim after dinner she walked by the sedan, and desired him to call Eutychus,\nand have him examined; to which he replied, \"O Antonia! the gods are\nmy witnesses that I am induced to do what I am going to do, not by my own\ninclination, but because I am forced to it by thy prayers.\" When he\nhad said this, he ordered Macro, who succeeded Sejanus, to bring Eutychus\nto him; accordingly, without any delay, he was brought. Then Tiberius asked\nhim what he had to say against a man who had given him his liberty. Upon\nwhich he said, \"O my lord! this Caius, and Agrippa with him, were\nonce riding in a chariot, when I sat at their feet, and, among other discourses\nthat passed, Agrippa said to Caius, Oh that the day would once come when\nthis old fellow will dies and name thee for the governor of the habitable\nearth! for then this Tiberius, his grandson, would be no hinderance, but\nwould be taken off by thee, and that earth would be happy, and I happy\nalso.\" Now Tiberius took these to be truly Agrippa's words, and bearing\na grudge withal at Agrippa, because, when he had commanded him to pay his\nrespects to Tiberius, his grandson, and the son of Drusus, Agrippa had\nnot paid him that respect, but had disobeyed his commands, and transferred\nall his regard to Caius; he said to Macro, \"Bind this man.\" But\nMacro, not distinctly knowing which of them it was whom he bid him bind,\nand not expecting that he would have any such thing done to Agrippa, he\nforbore, and came to ask more distinctly what it was that he said. But\nwhen Caesar had gone round the hippodrome, he found Agrippa standing: \"For\ncertain,\" said he, \"Macro, this is the man I meant to have bound;\"\nand when he still asked, \"Which of these is to be bound?\" he\nsaid \"Agrippa.\" Upon which Agrippa betook himself to make supplication\nfor himself, putting him in mind of his son, with whom he was brought up,\nand of Tiberius [his grandson] whom he had educated; but all to no purpose;\nfor they led him about bound even in his purple garments. It was also very\nhot weather, and they had but little wine to their meal, so that he was\nvery thirsty; he was also in a sort of agony, and took this treatment of\nhim heinously: as he therefore saw one of Caius's slaves, whose name was\nThaumastus, carrying some water in a vessel, he desired that he would let\nhim drink; so the servant gave him some water to drink, and he drank heartily,\nand said, \"O thou boy! this service of thine to me will be for thy\nadvantage; for if I once get clear of these my bonds, I will soon procure\nthee thy freedom of Caius who has not been wanting to minister to me now\nI am in bonds, in the same manner as when I was in my former state and\ndignity.\" Nor did he deceive him in what he promised him, but made\nhim amends for what he had now done; for when afterward Agrippa was come\nto the kingdom, he took particular care of Thaumastus, and got him his\nliberty from Caius, and made him the steward over his own estate; and when\nhe died, he left him to Agrippa his son, and to Bernice his daughter, to\nminister to them in the same capacity. The man also grew old in that honorable\npost, and therein died. But all this happened a good while later.", "Now Agrippa stood in his bonds before the royal palace, and leaned\non a certain tree for grief, with many others,. who were in bonds also;\nand as a certain bird sat upon the tree on which Agrippa leaned, (the Romans\ncall this bird bubo,) [an owl,] one of those that were bound, a German\nby nation, saw him, and asked a soldier who that man in purple was; and\nwhen he was informed that his name was Agrippa, and that he was by nation\na Jew, and one of the principal men of that nation, he asked leave of the\nsoldier to whom he was bound, \nto let him come nearer to him, to speak with him; for that he had a mind\nto inquire of him about some things relating to his country; which liberty,\nwhen he had obtained, and as he stood near him, he said thus to him by\nan interpreter: \"This sudden change of thy condition, O young man!\nis grievous to thee, as bringing on thee a manifold and very great adversity;\nnor wilt thou believe me, when I foretell how thou wilt get clear of this\nmisery which thou art now under, and how Divine Providence will provide\nfor thee. Know therefore (and I appeal to my own country gods, as well\nas to the gods of this place, who have awarded these bonds to us) that\nall I am going to say about thy concerns shall neither be said for favor\nnor bribery, nor out of an endeavor to make thee cheerful without cause;\nfor such predictions, when they come to fail, make the grief at last, and\nin earnest, more bitter than if the party had never heard of any such thing.\nHowever, though I run the hazard of my own self, I think it fit to declare\nto thee the prediction of the gods. It cannot be that thou shouldst long\ncontinue in these bonds; but thou wilt soon be delivered from them, and\nwilt be promoted to the highest dignity and power, and thou wilt be envied\nby all those who now pity thy hard fortune; and thou wilt be happy till\nthy death, and wilt leave thine happiness to the children whom thou shalt\nhave. But do thou remember, when thou seest this bird again, that thou\nwilt then live but five days longer. This event will be brought to pass\nby that God who hath sent this bird hither to be a sign unto thee. And\nI cannot but think it unjust to conceal from thee what I foreknow concerning\nthee, that, by thy knowing beforehand what happiness is coming upon thee,\nthou mayst not regard thy present misfortunes. But when this happiness\nshall actually befall thee, do not forget what misery I am in myself, but\nendeavor to deliver me.\" So when the German had said this, he made\nAgrippa laugh at him as much as he afterwards appeared worthy of admiration.\nBut now Antonia took Agrippa's misfortune to heart: however, to speak to\nTiberius on his behalf, she took to be a very difficult thing, and indeed\nquite impracticable, as to any hope of success; yet did she procure of\nMacro, that the soldiers that kept him should be of a gentle nature, and\nthat the centurion who was over them and was to diet with him, should be\nof the same disposition, and that he might have leave to bathe himself\nevery day, and that his freed-men and friends might come to him, and that\nother things that tended to ease him might be indulged him. So his friend\nSilas came in to him, and two of his freed-men, Marsyas and Stechus, brought\nhim such sorts of food as he was fond of, and indeed took great care of\nhim; they ,also brought him garments, under pretense of selling them; and\nwhen night came on, they laid them under him; and the soldiers assisted\nthem, as Macro had given them order to do beforehand. And this was Agrippa's\ncondition for six months' time, and in this case were his affairs.", "But for Tiberius, upon his return to Caprein, he fell sick. At first\nhis distemper was but gentle; but as that distemper increased upon him,\nhe had small or no hopes of recovery. Hereupon he bid Euodus, who was that\nfreed-man whom he most of all respected, to bring the children \nto him, for that he wanted to talk to them before he died. Now he had at\npresent no sons of his own alive for Drusus, who was his only son, was\ndead; but Drusus's son Tiberius was still living, whose additional name\nwas Gemellus: there was also living Caius, the son of Germanicus, who was\nthe son \nof his brother [Drusus]. He was now grown up, and had a liberal education,\nand was well improved by it, and was in esteem and favor with the people,\non account of the excellent character of his father Germanicus, who had\nattained the highest honor among the multitude, by the firmness of his\nvirtuous behavior, by the easiness and agreeableness of his conversing\nwith the multitude, and because the dignity he was in did not hinder his\nfamiliarity with them all, as if they were his equals; by which behavior\nhe was not only greatly esteemed by the people and the senate, but by every\none of those nations that were subject to the Romans; some of which were\naffected when they came to him with the gracefulness of their reception\nby him, and others were affected in the same manner by the report of the\nothers that had been with him; and, upon his death, there was a lamentation\nmade by all men; not such a one as was to be made in way of flattery to\ntheir rulers, while they did but counterfeit sorrow, but such as was real;\nwhile every body grieved at his death, as if they had lost one that was\nnear to them. And truly such had been his easy conversation with men, that\nit turned greatly to the advantage of his son among all; and, among others,\nthe soldiery were so peculiarly affected to him, that they reckoned it\nan eligible thing, if need were, to die themselves, if he might but attain\nto the government.", "But when Tiberius had given order to Euodus to bring the children\nto him the next day in the morning, he prayed to his country gods to show\nhim a manifest signal which of those children should come to the government;\nbeing very desirous to leave it to his son's son, but still depending upon\nwhat God should foreshow concerning them more than upon his own opinion\nand inclination; so he made this to be the omen, that the government should\nbe left to him who should come to him first the next day. When he had thus\nresolved within himself, he sent to his grandson's tutor, and ordered him\nto bring the child to him early in the morning, as supposing that God would\npermit him to be made emperor. But God proved opposite to his designation;\nfor while Tiberius was thus contriving matters, and as soon as it was at\nall day, he bid Euodus to call in that child which should be there ready.\nSo he went out, and found Caius before the door, for Tiberius was not yet\ncome, but staid waiting for his breakfast; for Euodus knew nothing of what\nhis lord intended; so he said to Caius, \"Thy father calls thee,\"\nand then brought him in. As soon as Tiberius saw Caius, and not before,\nhe reflected on the power of God, and how the ability of bestowing the\ngovernment on whom he would was entirely taken from him; and thence he\nwas not able to establish what he had intended. So he greatly lamented\nthat his power of establishing what he had before contrived was taken from\nhim, and that his grandson Tiberius was not only to lose the Roman empire\nby his fatality, but his own safety also, because his preservation would\nnow depend upon such as would be more potent than himself, who would think\nit a thing not to be borne, that a kinsman should live with them, and so\nhis relation would not be able to protect him; but he would be feared and\nbated by him who had the supreme authority, partly on account of his being\nnext to the empire, and partly on account of his perpetually contriving\nto get the government, both in order to preserve himself, and to be at\nthe head of affairs also. Now Tiberius had been very much given to astrology,\n\nand the calculation of nativities, and had spent his life in the esteem\nof what predictions had proved true, more than those whose profession it\nwas. Accordingly, when he once saw Galba coming in to him, he said to his\nmost intimate friends, that there came in a man that would one day have\nthe dignity of the Roman empire. So that this Tiberius was more addicted\nto all such sorts of diviners than any other of the Roman emperors, because\nhe had found them to have told him truth in his own affairs. And indeed\nhe was now in great distress upon this accident that had befallen him,\nand was very much grieved at the destruction of his son's son, which he\nforesaw, and complained of himself, that he should have made use of such\na method of divination beforehand, while it was in his power to have died\nwithout grief by this knowledge of futurity; whereas he was now tormented\nby his foreknowledge of the misfortune of such as were dearest to him,\nand must die under that torment. Now although he was disordered at this\nunexpected revolution of the government to those for whom he did not intend\nit, he spake thus to Caius, though unwillingly, and against his own inclination:\n\"O child! although Tiberius be nearer related to me than thou art,\nI, by my own determination, and the conspiring suffrage of the gods, do\ngive and put into thy hand the Roman empire; and I desire thee never to\nbe unmindful when thou comest to it, either of my kindness to thee, who\nset thee in so high a dignity, or of thy relation to Tiberius. But as thou\nknowest that I am, together with and after the gods, the procurer of so\ngreat happiness to thee; so I desire that thou wilt make me a return for\nmy readiness to assist thee, and wilt take care of Tiberius because of\nhis near relation to thee. Besides which, thou art to know, that while\nTiberius is alive, he will be a security to thee, both as to empire and\nas to thy own preservation; but if he die, that will be but a prelude to\nthy own misfortunes; for to be alone under the weight of such vast affairs\nis very dangerous; nor will the gods suffer those actions which are unjustly\ndone, contrary to that law which directs men to act otherwise, to go off\nunpunished.\" This was the speech which Tiberius made, which did not\npersuade Caius to act accordingly, although he promised so to do; but when\nhe was settled in the government, he took off this Tiberius, as was predicted\nby the other Tiberius; as he was also himself, in no long time afterward,\nslain by a secret plot laid against him.", "So when Tiberius had at this time appointed Caius to be his successor,\nhe outlived but a few days, and then died, after he had held the government\ntwenty-two years five months and three days. Now Caius was the fourth emperor.\nBut when the Romans understood that Tiberius was dead, they rejoiced at\nthe good news, but had not courage to believe it; not because they were\nunwilling it should be true, for they would have given huge sums of money\nthat it might be so, but because they were afraid, that if they had showed\ntheir joy when the news proved false, their joy should be openly known,\nand they should be accused for it, and be thereby undone. For this Tiberius\nhad brought a vast number of miseries on the best families of the Romans,\nsince he was easily inflamed with passion in all cases, and was of such\na temper as rendered his anger irrevocable, till he had executed the same,\nalthough he had taken a hatred against men without reason; for he was by\nnature fierce in all the sentences he gave, and made death the penalty\nfor the lightest offenses; insomuch that when the Romans heard the rumor\nabout his death gladly, they were restrained from the enjoyment of that\npleasure by the dread of such miseries as they foresaw would follow, if\ntheir hopes proved ill-grounded. Now Marsyas, Agrippa's freed-man, as soon\nas he heard of Tiberius's death, came running to tell Agrippa the news;\nand finding him going out to the bath, he gave him a nod, and said, in\nthe Hebrew tongue, \"The lion \nis dead;\" who, understanding his meaning, and being ovejoyed at the\nnews, \"Nay,\" said he, \"but all sorts of thanks and happiness\nattend thee for this news of thine; only I wish that what thou sayest may\nprove true.\" Now the centurion who was set to keep Agrippa, when he\nsaw with what haste Marsyas came, and what joy Agrippa had from what he\nsaid, he had a suspicion that his words implied some great innovation of\naffairs, and he asked them about what was said. They at first diverted\nthe discourse; but upon his further pressing, Agrippa, without more ado,\ntold him, for he was already become his friend; so he joined with him in\nthat pleasure which this news occasioned, because it would be fortunate\nto Agrippa, and made him a supper. But as they were feasting, and the cups\nwent about, there came one who said that Tiberius was still alive, and\nwould return to the city ill a few days. At which news the centurion was\nexceedingly troubled, because he had done what might cost him his life,\nto have treated so joyfully a prisoner, and this upon the news of the death\nof Caesar; so he thrust Agrippa from the couch whereon he lay, and said,\n\"Dost thou think to cheat me by a lie about the emperor without punishment?\nand shalt not thou pay for this thy malicious report at the price of thine\nhead?\" When he had so said, he ordered Agrippa to be bound again,\n(for he had loosed him before,) and kept a severer guard over him than\nformerly, and in that evil condition was Agrippa that night; but the next\nday the rumor increased in the city, and confirmed the news that Tiberius\nwas certainly dead; insomuch that men durst now openly and freely talk\nabout it; nay, some offered sacrifices on that account. Several letters\nalso came from Caius; one of them to the senate, which informed them of\nthe death of Tiberius, and of his own entrance on the government; another\nto Piso, the governor of the city, which told him the same thing. He also\ngave order that Agrippa should be removed out of the camp, and go to that\nhouse where he lived before he was put in prison; so that he was now out\nof fear as to his own affairs; for although he was still in custody, yet\nit was now with ease to his own affairs. Now, as soon as Caius was come\nto Rome, and had brought Tiberius's dead body with him, and had made a\nsumptuous funeral for him, according to the laws of his country, he was\nmuch disposed to set Agrippa at liberty that very day; but Antonia hindered\nhim, not out of any ill-will to the prisoner, but out of regard to decency\nin Caius, lest that should make men believe that he received the death\nof Tiberius with pleasure, when he loosed one whom he had bound immediately.\nHowever, there did not many days pass ere he sent for him to his house,\nand had him shaved, and made him change his raiment; after which he put\na diadem upon his head, and appointed him to be king of the tetrarchy of\nPhilip. He also gave him the tetrarchy of Lysanias, \nand changed his iron chain for a golden one of equal weight. He also sent\nMarullus to be procurator of Judea.", "Now, in the second year of the reign of Caius Caesar, Agrippa desired\nleave to be given him to sail home, and settle the affairs of his government;\nand he promised to return again, when he had put the rest in order, as\nit ought to be put. So, upon the emperor's permission, he came into his\nown country, and appeared to them all unexpectedly as asking, and thereby\ndemonstrated to the men that saw him the power of fortune, when they compared\nhis former poverty with his present happy affluence; so some called him\na happy man, and others could not well believe that things were so much\nchanged with him for the better.", "BUT Herodias, Agrippa's sister, who now lived as wife to that Herod\nwho was tetrarch of Galilee and Peres, took this authority of her brother\nin an envious manner, particularly when she saw that he had a greater dignity\nbestowed on him than her husband had; since, when he ran away, it was because\nhe was not able to pay his debts; and now he was come back, he was in a\nway of dignity, and of great good fortune. She was therefore grieved and\nmuch displeased at so great a mutation of his affairs; and chiefly when\nshe saw him marching among the multitude with the usual ensigns of royal\nauthority, she was not able to conceal how miserable she was, by reason\nof the envy she had towards him; but she excited her husband, and desired\nhim that he would sail to Rome, to court honors equal to his; for she said\nthat she could not bear to live any longer, while Agrippa, the son of that\nAristobulus who was condemned to die by his father, one that came to her\nhusband in such extreme poverty, that the necessaries of life were forced\nto be entirely supplied him day by day; and when he fled away from his\ncreditors by sea, he now returned a king; while he was himself the son\nof a king, and while the near relation he bare to royal authority called\nupon him to gain the like dignity, he sat still, and was contented with\na privater life. \"But then, Herod, although thou wast formerly not\nconcerned to be in a lower condition than thy father from whom thou wast\nderived had been, yet do thou now seek after the dignity which thy kinsman\nhath attained to; and do not thou bear this contempt, that a man who admired\nthy riches should he in greater honor than thyself, nor suffer his poverty\nto show itself able to purchase greater things than our abundance; nor\ndo thou esteem it other than a shameful thing to be inferior to one who,\nthe other day, lived upon thy charity. But let us go to Rome, and let us\nspare no pains nor expenses, either of silver or gold, since they cannot\nbe kept for any better use than for the obtaining of a kingdom.\"", "But for Herod, he opposed her request at this time, out of the love\nof ease, and having a suspicion of the trouble he should have at Rome;\nso he tried to instruct her better. But the more she saw him draw back,\nthe more she pressed him to it, and desired him to leave no stone unturned\nin order to be king; and at last she left not off till she engaged him,\nwhether he would or not, to be of her sentiments, because he could no otherwise\navoid her importunity. So he got all things ready, after as sumptuous a\nmanner as he was able, and spared for nothing, and went up to Rome, and\ntook Herodias along with him. But Agrippa, when he was made sensible of\ntheir intentions and preparations, he also prepared to go thither; and\nas soon as he heard they set sail, he sent Fortunatus, one of his freed-men,\nto Rome, to carry presents to the emperor, and letters against Herod, and\nto give Caius a particular account of those matters, if he should have\nany opportunity. This man followed Herod so quick, and had so prosperous\na voyage, and came so little after Herod, that while Herod was with Caius,\nhe came himself, and delivered his letters; for they both sailed to Dicearchia,\nand found Caius at Bairn, which is itself a little city of Campania, at\nthe distance of about five furlongs from Dicearchia. There are in that\nplace royal palaces, with sumptuous apartments, every emperor still endeavoring\nto outdo his predecessor's magnificence; the place ,also affords warm baths,\nthat spring out of the ground of their own accord, which are of advantage\nfor the recovery of the health of those that make use of them; and, besides,\nthey minister to men's luxury also. Now Caius saluted Herod, for he first\nmet with him, and then looked upon the letters which Agrippa had sent him,\nand which were written in order to accuse Herod; wherein he accused him,\nthat he had been in confederacy with Sejanus against Tiberius's and that\nhe was now confederate with Artabanus, the king of Parthia, in opposition\nto the government of Caius; as a demonstration of which he alleged, that\nhe had armor sufficient for seventy thousand men ready in his armory. Caius\nwas moved at this information, and asked Herod whether what was said about\nthe armor was true; and when he confessed there was such armor there, for\nhe could not deny the same, the truth of it being too notorious, Caius\ntook that to be a sufficient proof of the accusation, that he intended\nto revolt. So he took away from him his tetrarchy, and gave it by way of\naddition to Agrippa's kingdom; he also gave Herod's money to Agrippa, and,\nby way of punishment, awarded him a perpetual banishment, and appointed\nLyons, a city of Gaul, to be his place of habitation. But when he was informed\nthat Herodias was Agrippa's sister, he made her a present of what money\nwas her own, and told her that it was her brother who prevented her being\nput under the same calamity with her husband. But she made this reply:\n\"Thou, indeed, O emperor! actest after a magnificent manner, and as\nbecomes thyself in what thou offerest me; but the kindness which I have\nfor my husband hinders me from partaking of the favor of thy gift; for\nit is not just that I, who have been made a partner in his prosperity,\nshould forsake him in his misfortunes.\" Hereupon Caius was angry at\nher, and sent her with Herod into banishment, and gave her estate to Agrippa.\nAnd thus did God punish Herodias for her envy at her brother, and Herod\nalso for giving ear to the vain discourses of a woman. Now Caius managed\npublic affairs with great magnanimity during the first and second year\nof his reign, and behaved himself with such moderation, that he gained\nthe good-will of the Romans themselves, and of his other subjects. But,\nin process of time, he went beyond the bounds of human nature in his conceit\nof himself, and by reason of the vastness of his dominions made himself\na god, and took upon himself to act in all things to the reproach of the\nDeity itself.", "THERE was now a tumult arisen at Alexandria, between the Jewish inhabitants\nand the Greeks; and three ambassadors were chosen out of each party that\nwere at variance, who came to Caius. Now one of these ambassadors from\nthe people of Alexandria was Apion, \nwho uttered many blasphemies against the Jews; and, among other things\nthat he said, he charged them with neglecting the honors that belonged\nto Caesar; for that while all who were subject to the Roman empire built\naltars and temples to Caius, and in other regards universally received\nhim as they received the gods, these Jews alone thought it a dishonorable\nthing for them to erect statues in honor of him, as well as to swear by\nhis name. Many of these severe things were said by Apion, by which he hoped\nto provoke Caius to anger at the Jews, as he was likely to be. But Philo,\nthe principal of the Jewish embassage, a man eminent on all accounts, brother\nto Alexander the alabarch, \nand one not unskillful in philosophy, was ready to betake himself to make\nhis defense against those accusations; but Caius prohibited him, and bid\nhim begone; he was also in such a rage, that it openly appeared he was\nabout to do them some very great mischief. So Philo being thus affronted,\nwent out, and said to those Jews who were about him, that they should be\nof good courage, since Caius's words indeed showed anger at them, but in\nreality had already set God against himself.", "Hereupon Caius, taking it very heinously that he should be thus despised\nby the Jews alone, sent Petronius to be president of Syria, and successor\nin the government to Vitellius, and gave him order to make an invasion\ninto Judea, with a great body of troops; and if they would admit of his\nstatue willingly, to erect it in the temple of God; but if they were obstinate,\nto conquer them by war, and then to do it. Accordingly, Petronius took\nthe government of Syria, and made haste to obey Caesar's epistle. He got\ntogether as great a number of auxiliaries as he possibly could, and took\nwith him two legions of the Roman army, and came to Ptolemais, and there\nwintered, as intending to set about the war in the spring. He also wrote\nword to Caius what he had resolved to do, who commended him for his alacrity,\nand ordered him to go on, and to make war with them, in case they would\nnot obey his commands. But there came many ten thousands of the Jews to\nPetronius, to Ptolemais, to offer their petitions to him, that he would\nnot compel them to transgress and violate the law of their forefathers;\n\"but if,\" said they, \"thou art entirely resolved to bring\nthis statue, and erect it, do thou first kill us, and then do what thou\nhast resolved on; for while we are alive we cannot permit such things as\nare forbidden us to be done by the authority of our legislator, and by\nour forefathers' determination that such prohibitions are instances of\nvirtue.\" But Petronius was angry at them, and said, \"If indeed\nI were myself emperor, and were at liberty to follow my own inclination,\nand then had designed to act thus, these your words would be justly spoken\nto me; but now Caesar hath sent to me, I am under the necessity of being\nsubservient to his decrees, because a disobedience to them will bring upon\nme inevitable destruction.\" Then the Jews replied, \"Since, therefore,\nthou art so disposed, O Petronius! that thou wilt not disobey Caius's epistles,\nneither will we transgress the commands of our law; and as we depend upon\nthe excellency of our laws, and, by the labors of our ancestors, have continued\nhitherto without suffering them to be transgressed, we dare not by any\nmeans suffer ourselves to be so timorous as to transgress those laws out\nof the fear of death, which God hath determined are for our advantage;\nand if we fall into misfortunes, we will bear them, in order to preserve\nour laws, as knowing that those who expose themselves to dangers have good\nhope of escaping them, because God will stand on our side, when, out of\nregard to him, we undergo afflictions, and sustain the uncertain turns\nof fortune. But if we should submit to thee, we should be greatly reproached\nfor our cowardice, as thereby showing ourselves ready to transgress our\nlaw; and we should incur the great anger of God also, who, even thyself\nbeing judge, is superior to Caius.\"", "When Petronius saw by their words that their determination was hard\nto be removed, and that, without a war, he should not be able to be subservient\nto Caius in the dedication of his statue, and that there must be a great\ndeal of bloodshed, he took his friends, and the servants that were about\nhim, and hasted to Tiberias, as wanting to know in what posture the affairs\nof the Jews were; and many ten thousands of the Jews met Petronius again,\nwhen he was come to Tiberias. These thought they must run a mighty hazard\nif they should have a war with the Romans, but judged that the transgression\nof the law was of much greater consequence, and made supplication to him,\nthat he would by no means reduce them to such distresses, nor defile their\ncity with the dedication of the statue. Then Petronius said to them, \"Will\nyou then make war with Caesar, without considering his great preparations\nfor war, and your own weakness?\" They replied, \"We will not by\nany means make war with him, but still we will die before we see our laws\ntransgressed.\" So they threw themselves down upon their faces, and\nstretched out their throats, and said they were ready to be slain; and\nthis they did for forty days together, and in the mean time left off the\ntilling of their ground, and that while the season of the year required\nthem to sow it. \nThus they continued firm in their resolution, and proposed to themselves\nto die willingly, rather than to see the dedication of the statue.", "When matters were in this state, Aristobulus, king Agrippa's brother,\nand Heleias the Great, and the other principal men of that family with\nthem, went in unto Petronius, and besought him, that since he saw the resolution\nof the multitude, he would not make any alteration, and thereby drive them\nto despair; but would write to Caius, that the Jews had an insuperable\naversion to the reception of the statue, and how they continued with him,\nand left of the tillage off their ground: that they were not willing to\ngo to war with him, because they were not able to do it, but were ready\nto die with pleasure, rather than suffer their laws to be transgressed:\nand how, upon the land's continuing unsown, robberies would grow up, on\nthe inability they would be under of paying their tributes; and that Caius\nmight be thereby moved to pity, and not order any barbarous action to be\ndone to them, nor think of destroying the nation: that if he continues\ninflexible in his former opinion to bring a war upon them, he may then\nset about it himself. And thus did Aristobulus, and the rest with him,\nsupplicate Petronius. So Petronius, \npartly on account of the pressing instances which Aristobulus and the rest\nwith him made, and because of the great consequence of what they desired,\nand the earnestness wherewith they made their supplication,  partly on\naccount of the firmness of the opposition made by the Jews, which he saw,\nwhile he thought it a terrible thing for him to be such a slave to the\nmadness of Caius, as to slay so many ten thousand men, only because of\ntheir religious disposition towards God, and after that to pass his life\nin expectation of punishment; Petronius, I say, thought it much better\nto send to Caius, and to let him know how intolerable it was to him to\nbear the anger he might have against him for not serving him sooner, in\nobedience to his epistle, for that perhaps he might persuade him; and that\nif this mad resolution continued, he might then begin the war against them;\nnay, that in case he should turn his hatred against himself, it was fit\nfor virtuous persons even to die for the sake of such vast multitudes of\nmen. Accordingly, he determined to hearken to the petitioners in this matter.", "He then called the Jews together to Tiberias, who came many ten thousands\nin number; he also placed that army he now had with him opposite to them;\nbut did not discover his own meaning, but the commands of the emperor,\nand told them that his wrath would, without delay, be executed on such\nas had the courage to disobey what he had commanded, and this immediately;\nand that it was fit for him, who had obtained so great a dignity by his\ngrant, not to contradict him in any thing:  \"yet,\" said he, \"I\ndo not think it just to have such a regard to my own safety and honor,\nas to refuse to sacrifice them for your preservation, who are so many in\nnumber, and endeavor to preserve the regard that is due to your law; which\nas it hath come down to you from your forefathers, so do you esteem it\nworthy of your utmost contention to preserve it: nor, with the supreme\nassistance and power of God, will I be so hardy as to suffer your temple\nto fall into contempt by the means of the imperial authority. I will, therefore,\nsend to Caius, and let him know what your resolutions are, and will assist\nyour suit as far as I am able, that you may not be exposed to suffer on\naccount of the honest designs you have proposed to yourselves; and may\nGod be your assistant, for his authority is beyond all the contrivance\nand power of men; and may he procure you the preservation of your ancient\nlaws, and may not he be deprived, though without your consent, of his accustomed\nhonors. But if Caius be irritated, and turn the violence of his rage upon\nme, I will rather undergo all that danger and that affliction that may\ncome either on my body or my soul, than see so many of you to perish, while\nyou are acting in so excellent a manner. Do you, therefore, every one of\nyou, go your way about your own occupations, and fall to the cultivation\nof your ground; I will myself send to Rome, and will not refuse to serve\nyou in all things, both by myself and by my friends.\"", "When Petronius had said this, and had dismissed rite assembly of\nthe Jews, he desired the principal of them to take care of their husbandry,\nand to speak kindly to the people, and encourage them to have good hope\nof their affairs. Thus did he readily bring the multitude to be cheerful\nagain. And now did God show his presence to Petronius, and signify to him\nthat he would afford him his assistance in his whole design; for he had\nno sooner finished the speech that he made to the Jews, but God sent down\ngreat showers of rain, contrary to human expectation; \nfor that day was a clear day, and gave no sign, by the appearance of the\nsky, of any rain; nay, the whole year had been subject to a great drought,\nand made men despair of any water from above, even when at any time they\nsaw the heavens overcast with clouds; insomuch that when such a great quantity\nof rain came, and that in an unusual manner, and without any other expectation\nof it, the Jews hoped that Petronius would by no means fail in his petition\nfor them. But as to Petronius, he was mightily surprised when he perceived\nthat God evidently took care of the Jews, and gave very plain signs of\nhis appearance, and this to such a degree, that those that were in earnest\nmuch inclined to the contrary had no power left to contradict it. This\nwas also among those other particulars which he wrote to Caius, which all\ntended to dissuade him, and by all means to entreat him not to make so\nmany ten thousands of these men go distracted; whom, if he should slay,\n(for without war they would by no means suffer the laws of their worship\nto be set aside,) he would lose the revenue they paid him, and would be\npublicly cursed by them for all future ages. Moreover, that God, who was\ntheir Governor, had shown his power most evidently on their account, and\nthat such a power of his as left no room for doubt about it. And this was\nthe business that Petronius was now engaged in.", "But king Agrippa, who now lived at Rome, was more and more in the\nfavor of Caius; and when he had once made him a supper, and was careful\nto exceed all others, both in expenses and in such preparations as might\ncontribute most to his pleasure; nay, it was so far from the ability of\nothers, that Caius himself could never equal, much less exceed it (such\ncare had he taken beforehand to exceed all men, and particularly. to make\nall agreeable to Caesar); hereupon Caius admired his understanding and\nmagnificence, that he should force himself to do all to please him, even\nbeyond such expenses as he could bear, and was desirous not to be behind\nAgrippa in that generosity which he exerted in order to please him. So\nCaius, when he had drank wine plentifully, and was merrier than ordinary,\nsaid thus during the feast, when Agrippa had drunk to him: \"I knew\nbefore now how great a respect thou hast had for me, and how great kindness\nthou hast shown me, though with those hazards to thyself, which thou underwentest\nunder Tiberius on that account; nor hast thou omitted any thing to show\nthy good-will towards us, even beyond thy ability; whence it would be a\nbase thing for me to be conquered by thy affection. I am therefore desirous\nto make thee amends for every thing in which I have been formerly deficient;\nfor all that I have bestowed on thee, that may be called my gifts, is but\nlittle. Everything that may contribute to thy happiness shall be at thy\nservice, and that cheerfully, and so far as my ability will reach.\"\n\nAnd this was what Caius said to Agrippa, thinking be would ask for some\nlarge country, or the revenues of certain cities. But although he had prepared\nbeforehand what he would ask, yet had he not discovered his intentions,\nbut made this answer to Caius immediately: That it was not out of any expectation\nof gain that he formerly paid his respects to him, contrary to the commands\nof Tiberius, nor did he now do any thing relating to him out of regard\nto his own advantage, and in order to receive any thing from him; that\nthe gifts he had already bestowed upon him were great, and beyond the hopes\nof even a craving man; for although they may be beneath thy power, [who\nart the donor,] yet are they greater than my inclination and dignity, who\nam the receiver. And as Caius was astonished at Agrippa's inclinations,\nand still the more pressed him to make his request for somewhat which he\nmight gratify him with, Agrippa replied, \"Since thou, O my lord! declarest\nsuch is thy readiness to grant, that I am worthy of thy gifts, I will ask\nnothing relating to my own felicity; for what thou hast already bestowed\non me has made me excel therein; but I desire somewhat which may make thee\nglorious for piety, and render the Divinity assistant to thy designs, and\nmay be for an honor to me among those that inquire about it, as showing\nthat I never once fail of obtaining what I desire of thee; for my petition\nis this, that thou wilt no longer think of the dedication of that statue\nwhich thou hast ordered to be set up in the Jewish temple by Petronius.\"", "And thus did Agrippa venture to cast the die upon this occasion,\nso great was the affair in his opinion, and in reality, though he knew\nhow dangerous a thing it was so to speak; for had not Caius approved of\nit, it had tended to no less than the loss of his life. So Caius, who was\nmightily taken with Agrippa's obliging behavior, and on other accounts\nthinking it a dishonorable thing to be guilty of falsehood before so many\nwitnesses, in points wherein he had with such alacrity forced Agrippa to\nbecome a petitioner, and that it would look as if he had already repented\nof what he had said, and because he greatly admired Agrippa's virtue, in\nnot desiring him at all to augment his own dominions, either with larger\nrevenues, or other authority, but took care of the public tranquillity,\nof the laws, and of the Divinity itself, he granted him what he had requested.\nHe also wrote thus to Petronius, commending him for his assembling his\narmy, and then consulting him about these affairs. \"If therefore,\"\nsaid' he,\" thou hast already erected my statue, let it stand; but\nif thou hast not yet dedicated it, do not trouble thyself further about\nit, but dismiss thy army, go back, and take care of those affairs which\nI sent thee about at first, for I have now no occasion for the erection\nof that statue. This I have granted as a favor to Agrippa, a man whom I\nhonor so very greatly, that I am not able to contradict what he would have,\nor what he desired me to do for him.\" And this was what Caius wrote\nto Petronius, which was before he received his letter, informing him that\nthe Jews were very ready to revolt about the statue, and that they seemed\nresolved to threaten war against the Romans, and nothing else. When therefore\nCaius was much displeased that any attempt should be made against his government\nas he was a slave to base and vicious actions on all occasions, and had\nno regard to What was virtuous and honorable, and against whomsoever he\nresolved to show his anger, and that for any cause whatsoever, he suffered\nnot himself to be restrained by any admonition, but thought the indulging\nhis anger to be a real pleasure, he wrote thus to Petronius: \"Seeing\nthou esteemest the presents made thee by the Jews to be of greater value\nthan my commands, and art grown insolent enough to be subservient to their\npleasure, I charge thee to become thy own judge, and to consider what thou\nart to do, now thou art under my displeasure; for I will make thee an example\nto the present and to all future ages, that they. may not dare to contradict\nthe commands of their emperor.\"", "This was the epistle which Caius wrote to. Petronius; but Petronius\ndid not receive it while Caius was alive, that ship which carried it sailing\nso slow, that other letters came to Petronius before this, by which he\nunderstood that Caius was dead; for God would not forget the dangers Petronius\nhad undertaken on account of the Jews, and of his own honor. But when he\nhad taken Caius away, out of his indignation of what he had so insolently\nattempted in assuming to himself divine worship, both Rome and all that\ndominion conspired with Petronius, especially those that were of the senatorian\norder, to give Caius his due reward, because he had been unmercifully severe\nto them; for he died not long after he had written to Petronius that epistle\nwhich threatened him with death. But as for the occasion of his death,\nand the nature of the plot against him, I shall relate them in the progress\nof this narration. Now that epistle which informed Petronius of Caius's\ndeath came first, and a little afterward came that which commanded him\nto kill himself with his own hands. Whereupon he rejoiced at this coincidence\nas to the death of Caius, and admired God's providence, who, without the\nleast delay, and immediately, gave him a reward for the regard he had to\nthe temple, and the assistance he afforded the Jews for avoiding the dangers\nthey were in. And by this means Petronius escaped that danger of death,\nwhich he could not foresee.", "A VERY sad calamity now befell the Jews that were in Mesopotamia,\nand especially those that dwelt in Babylonia. Inferior it was to none of\nthe calamities which had gone before, and came together with a great slaughter\nof them, and that greater than any upon record before; concerning all which\nI shall speak accurately, and shall explain the occasions whence these\nmiseries came upon them. There was a city of Babylonia called Neerda; not\nonly a ver populous one, but one that had a good and a large territory\nabout it, and, besides its other advantages, full of men also. It was,\nbesides, not easily to be assaulted by enemies, from the river Euphrates\nencompassing it all round, and from the wails that were built about it.\nThere was also the city Nisibis, situate on the same current of the river.\nFor which reason the Jews, depending on the natural strength of these places,\ndeposited in them that half shekel which every one, by the custom of our\ncountry, offers unto God, as well as they did other things devoted to him;\nfor they made use of these cities as a treasury, whence, at a proper time,\nthey were transmitted to Jerusalem; and many ten thousand men undertook\nthe carriage of those donations, out of fear of the ravages of the Parthians,\nto whom the Babylonians were then subject. Now there were two men, Asineus\nand Anileus, of the city Neerda by birth, and brethren to one another.\nThey were destitute of a father, and their mother put them to learn the\nart of weaving curtains, it not being esteemed ,disgrace among them for\nmen to be weavers of cloth. Now he that taught them that art, and was set\nover them, complained that they came too late to their work, and punished\nthem with stripes; but they took this just punishment as an affront, and\ncarried off all the weapons which were kept in that house, which were not\na few, and went into a certain place where was a partition of the rivers,\nand was a place naturally very fit for the feeding of cattle, and for preserving\nsuch fruits as were usually laid up against winter. The poorest sort of\nthe young men also resorted to them, whom they armed with the weapons they\nhad gotten, and became their captains; and nothing hindered them from being\ntheir leaders into mischief; for as soon as they were become invincible,\nand had built them a citadel, they sent to such as fed cattle, and ordered\nthem to pay them so much tribute out of them as might be sufficient for\ntheir maintenance, proposing also that they would be their friends, if\nthey would submit to them, and that they would defend them from all their\nother enemies on every side, but that they would kill the cattle of those\nthat refused to obey them. So they hearkened to their proposals, (for they\ncould do nothing else,) and sent them as many sheep as were required of\nthem; whereby their forces grew greater, and they became lords over all\nthey pleased, because they marched suddenly, and did them a mischief, insomuch\nthat every body who had to do with them chose to pay them respect; and\nthey became formidable to such as came to assault them, till the report\nabout them came to the ears of the king of Parthia himself.", "But when the governor of Babylonia understood this, and had a mind\nto put a stop to them before they grew greater, and before greater mischiefs\nshould arise from them, he got together as great an army as he could, both\nof Parthians and Babylonians, and marched against them, thinking to attack\nthem and destroy them before any one should carry them the news that he\nhad got an army together. He then encamped at a lake, and lay still; but\non the next day (it was the sabbath, which is among the Jews a day of rest\nfrom all sorts of work) he supposed that the enemy would not dare to fight\nhim thereon, but that he would take them and carry them away prisoners,\nwithout fighting. He therefore proceeded gradually, and thought to fall\nupon them on the sudden. Now Asineus was sitting with the rest, and their\nweapons lay by them; upon which he said, \"Sirs, I hear a neighing\nof horses; not of such as are feeding, but such as have men on their backs;\nI also hear such a noise of their bridles, that I am afraid that some enemies\nare coming upon us to encompass us round. However, let somebody go to look\nabout, and make report of what reality there is in the present state of\nthings; and may what I have said prove a false alarm.\" And when he\nhad said this, some of them went out to spy out what was the matter; and\nthey came again immediately, and said to him, that \"neither hast thou\nbeen mistaken in telling us what our enemies were doing, nor will those\nenemies permit us to be injurious to people any longer. We are caught by\ntheir intrigues like brute beasts, and there is a large body of cavalry\nmarching upon us, while we are destitute of hands to defend ourselves withal,\nbecause we are restrained from doing it by the prohibition of our law,\nwhich obliges us to rest [on this day].\" But Asiueus did not by any\nmeans agree with the opinion of his spy as to what was to be done, but\nthought it more agreeable to the law to pluck up their spirits in this\nnecessity they were fallen into, and break their law by avenging themselves,\nalthough they should die in the action, than by doing nothing to please\ntheir enemies in submitting to be slain by them. Accordingly, he took up\nhis weapons, and infused courage into those that were with him to act as\ncourageously as himself. So they fell upon their enemies, and slew a great\nmany of them, because they despised them and came as to a certain victory,\nand put the rest to flight.", "But when the news of this fight came to the king of Parthia, he was\nsurprised at the boldness of these brethren, and was desirous to see them,\nand speak with them. He therefore sent the most trusty of all his guards\nto say thus to them: \"That king Artsbanus, although he had been unjustly\ntreated by you, who have made an attempt against his government, yet hath\nhe more regard to your courageous behavior, than to the anger he bears\nto you, and hath sent me to give you his right hand \nand security; and he permits you to come to him safely, and without any\nviolence upon the road; and he wants to have you address yourselves to\nhim as friends, without meaning any guile or deceit to you. He also promises\nto make you presents, and to pay you those respects which will make an\naddition of his power to your courage, and thereby be of advantage to you.\"\nYet did Asineus himself put off his journey thither, but sent his brother\nAnileus with all such presents as he could procure. So he went, and was\nadmitted to the king's presence; and when Artabanus saw Anileus coming\nalone, he inquired into the reason why Asineus avoided to come along with\nhim; and when he understood that he was afraid, and staid by the lake,\nhe took an oath, by the gods of his country, that he would do them no harm,\nif they came to him upon the assurances he gave them, and gave him his\nright hand. This is of the greatest force there with all these barbarians,\nand affords a firm security to those who converse with them; for none of\nthem will deceive you when once they have given you their right hands,\nnor will any one doubt of their fidelity, when that is once given, even\nthough they were before suspected of injustice. When Artabanus had done\nthis, he sent away Anileus to persuade his brother to come to him. Now\nthis the king did, because he wanted to curb his own governors of provinces\nby the courage of these Jewish brethren, lest they should make a league\nwith them; for they were ready for a revolt, and were disposed to rebel,\nhad they been sent on an expedition against them. He was also afraid, lest\nwhen he was engaged in a war, in order to subdue those governors of provinces\nthat had revolted, the party of Asineus, and those in Babylonia, should\nbe augmented, and either make war upon him, when they should hear of that\nrevolt, or if they should be disappointed in that case, they would not\nfail of doing further mischief to him.", "When the king had these intentions, he sent away Anileus, and Anileus\nprevailed on his brother [to come to the king], when he had related to\nhim the king's good-will, and the oath that he had taken. Accordingly,\nthey made haste to go to Artsbanus, who received them when they were come\nwith pleasure, and admired Asineus's courage in the actions he had done,\nand this because he was a little man to see to, and at first sight appeared\ncontemptible also, and such as one might deem a person of no value at all.\nHe also said to his friends, how, upon the comparison, he showed his soul\nto be in all respects superior to his body; and when, as they were drinking\ntogether, he once showed Asineus to Abdagases, one of the generals of his\narmy, and told him his name, and described the great courage he was of\nin war, and Abdagases had desired leave to kill him, and thereby to inflict\non him a punishment for those injuries he had done to the Parthian government,\nthe king replied, \"I will never give thee leave to kill a man who\nhath depended on my faith, especially not after I have sent him my right\nhand, and endeavored to gain his belief by oaths made by the gods. But\nif thou be a truly warlike man, thou standest not in need of my perjury.\nGo thou then, and avenge the Parthian government; attack this man, when\nhe is returned back, and conquer him by the forces that are under thy command,\nwithout my privity.\" Hereupon the king called for Asineus, and said\nto him, \"It is time for thee, O thou young man! to return home, and\nnot provoke the indignation of my generals in this place any further, lest\nthey attempt to murder thee, and that without my approbation. I commit\nto thee the country of Babylonia in trust, that it may, by thy care, be\npreserved free from robbers, and from other mischiefs. I have kept my faith\ninviolable to thee, and that not in trifling affairs, but in those that\nconcerned thy safety, and do therefore deserve thou shouldst be kind to\nme.\" When he had said this, and given Asineus some presents, he sent\nhim away immediately; who, when he was come home, built fortresses, and\nbecame great in a little time, and managed things with such courage and\nsuccess, as no other person, that had no higher a beginning, ever did before\nhim. Those Parthian governors also, who were sent that way, paid him great\nrespect; and the honor that was paid him by the Babylonians seemed to them\ntoo small, and beneath his deserts, although he were in no small dignity\nand power there; nay, indeed, all the affairs of Mesopotamia depended upon\nhim, and he more and more flourished in this happy condition of his for\nfifteen years.", "But as their affairs were in so flourishing a state, there sprang\nup a calamity among them on the following occasion. When once they had\ndeviated from that course of virtue whereby they had gained so great power,\nthey affronted and transgressed the laws of their forefathers, and fell\nunder the dominion of their lusts and pleasures. A certain Parthian, who\ncame as general of an army into those parts, had a wife following him,\nwho had a vast reputation for other accomplishments, and particularly was\nadmired above all other women for her beauty. Anileus, the brother of Asineus,\neither heard of that her beauty from others, or perhaps saw her himself\nalso, and so became at once her lover and her enemy; partly because he\ncould not hope to enjoy this woman but by obtaining power over her as a\ncaptive, and partly because he thought he could not conquer his inclinations\nfor her. As soon therefore as her husband had been declared an enemy to\nthem, and was fallen in the battle, the widow of the deceased was married\nto this her lover. However, this woman did not come into their house without\nproducing great misfortunes, both to Anileus himself, and to Asineus also;\nbut brought great mischiefs upon them on the occasion following. Since\nshe was led away captive, upon the death of her husband, she concealed\nthe images of those gods which were their country gods, common to her husband\nand to herself: now it was the custom \nof that country for all to have the idols they worship in their own houses,\nand to carry them along with them when they go into a foreign land; agreeable\nto which custom of theirs she carried her idols with her. Now at first\nshe performed her worship to them privately; but when she was become Anileus's\nmarried wife, she worshipped them in her accustomed manner, and with the\nsame appointed ceremonies which she used in her former husband's days;\nupon which their most esteemed friends blamed him at first, that he did\nnot act after the manner of the Hebrews, nor perform what was agreeable\nto their laws, in marrying a foreign wife, and one that transgressed the\naccurate appointments of their sacrifices and religious ceremonies; that\nhe ought to consider, lest, by allowing himself in many pleasures of the\nbody, he might lose his principality, on account of the beauty of a wife,\nand that high authority which, by God's blessing, he had arrived at. But\nwhen they prevailed not at all upon him, he slew one of them for whom he\nhad the greatest respect, because of the liberty he took with him; who,\nwhen he was dying, out of regard to the laws, imprecated a punishment upon\nhis murderer Anileus, and upon Asineus also, and that all their companions\nmight come to a like end from their enemies; upon the two first as the\nprincipal actors of this wickedness, and upon the rest as those that would\nnot assist him when he suffered in the defense of their laws. Now these\nlatter were sorely grieved, yet did they tolerate these doings, because\nthey remembered that they had arrived at their present happy state by no\nother means than their fortitude. But when they also heard of the worship\nof those gods whom the Parthians adore, they thought the injury that Anileus\noffered to their laws was to be borne no longer; and a greater number of\nthem came to Asineus, and loudly complained of Aniteus, and told him that\nit had been well that he had of himself seen what was advantageous to them;\nbut that however it was now high time to correct what had been done amiss,\nbefore the crime that had been committed proved the ruin of himself and\nall the rest of them. They added, that the marriage of this woman was made\nwithout their consent, and without a regard to their old laws; and that\nthe worship which this woman paid [to her gods] was a reproach to the God\nwhom they worshipped. Now Asineus was sensible of his brother's offense,\nthat it had been already the cause of great mischiefs, and would be so\nfor the time to come; yet did he tolerate the same from the good-will he\nhad to so near a relation, and forgiving it to him, on account that his\nbrother was quite overborne by his wicked inclinations. But as more and\nmore still came about him every day, and the clamors about it became greater,\nhe at length spake to Anileus about these clamors, reproving him for his\nformer actions, and desiring him for the future to leave them off, and\nsend the woman back to her relations. But nothing was gained by these reproofs;\nfor as the woman perceived what a tumult was made among the people on her\naccount, and was afraid for Anileus, lest he should come to any harm for\nhis love to her, she infused poison into Asineus's food, and thereby took\nhim off, and was now secure of prevailing, when her lover was to be judge\nof what should be done about her.", "So Anileus took the government upon himself alone, and led his army\nagainst the villages of Mithridates, who was a man of principal authority\nin Parthin, and had married king Artabanus's daughter; he also plundered\nthem, and among that prey was found much money, and many slaves, as also\na great number of sheep, and many other things, which, when gained, make\nmen's condition happy. Now when Mithridates, who was there at this time,\nheard that his villages were taken, he was very much displeased to find\nthat Anileus had first begun to injure him, and to affront him in his present\ndignity, when he had not offered any injury to him beforehand; and he got\ntogether the greatest body of horsemen he was able, and those out of that\nnumber which were of an age fit for war, and came to fight Anileus; and\nwhen he was arrived at a certain village of his own, he lay still there,\nas intending to fight him on the day following, because it was the sabbath,\nthe day on which the Jews rest. And when Anileus was informed of this by\na Syrian stranger of another village, who not only gave him an exact account\nof other circumstances, but told him where Mithridates would have a feast,\nhe took his supper at a proper time, and marched by night, with an intent\nof falling upon the Parthians while they were unaprrized what they should\ndo; so he fell upon them about the fourth watch of the night, and some\nof them he slew while they were asleep, and others he put to flight, and\ntook Mithridates alive, and set him naked upon an ass \nwhich, among the Parthians, is esteemed the greatest reproach possible.\nAnd when he had brought him into a wood with such a resolution, and his\nfriends desired him to kill Mithridates, he soon told them his own mind\nto the contrary, and said that it was not right to kill a man who was of\none of the principal families among the Parthians, and greatly honored\nwith matching into the royal family; that so far as they had hitherto gone\nwas tolerable; for although they had injured Mithridates, yet if they preserved\nhis life, this benefit would be remembered by him to the advantage of those\nthat gave it him; but that if be were once put to death, the king would\nnot be at rest till he had made a great slaughter of the Jews that dwelt\nat Babylon; \"to whose safety we ought to have a regard, both on account\nof our relation to them, and because if any misfortune befall us, we have\nno other place to retire to, since he hath gotten the flower of their youth\nunder him.\" By this thought, and this speech of his made in council,\nhe persuaded them to act accordingly; so Mithridates was let go. But when\nhe was got away, his wife reproached him, that although he was son-in-law\nto the king, he neglected to avenge himself on those that had injured him,\nwhile he took no care about it, but was contented to have been made a captive\nby the Jews, and to have escaped them; and she bid him either to go back\nlike a man of courage, or else she sware by the gods of their royal family\nthat she would certainly dissolve her marriage with him. Upon which, partly\nbecause he could not bear the daily trouble of her taunts, and partly because\nhe was afraid of her insolence, lest she should in earnest dissolve their\nmarriage, he unwillingly, and against his inclinations, got together again\nas great an army as he could, and marched along with them, as himself thinking\nit a thing not to be borne any longer, that he, a Parthian, should owe\nhis preservation to the Jews, when they had been too hard for him in the\nwar.", "But as soon as Anileus understood that Mithridates was marching with\na great army against him, he thought it too ignominious a thing to tarry\nabout the lakes, and not to take the first opportunity of meeting his enemies,\nand he hoped to have the same success, and to beat their enemies as they\ndid before; as also he ventured boldly upon the like attempts. Accordingly,\nhe led out his army, and a great many more joined themselves to that army,\nin order to betake themselves to plunder the people, and in order to terrify\nthe enemy again by their numbers. But when they had marched ninety furlongs,\nwhile the road had been through dry [and sandy] places, and about the midst\nof the day, they were become very thirsty; and Mithridates appeared, and\nfell upon them, as they were in distress for want of water, on which account,\nand on account of the time of the day, they were not able to bear their\nweapons. So Anileus and his men were put to an ignominious rout, while\nmen in despair were to attack those that were fresh and in good plight;\nso a great slaughter was made, and many ten thousand men fell. Now Anileus,\nand all that stood firm about him, ran away as fast as they were able into\na wood, and afforded Mithridates the pleasure of having gained a great\nvictory over them. But there now came in to Anileus a conflux of bad men,\nwho regarded their own lives very little, if they might but gain some present\nease, insomuch that they, by thus coming to him, compensated the multitude\nof those that perished in the fight. Yet were not these men like to those\nthat fell, because they were rash, and unexercised in war; however, with\nthese he came upon the villages of the Babylonians, and a mighty devastation\nof all things was made there by the injuries that Anileus did them. So\nthe Babylonians, and those that had already been in the war, sent to Neerda\nto the Jews there, and demanded Anileus. But although they did not agree\nto their demands, (for if they had been willing to deliver him up, it was\nnot in their power so to do,) yet did they desire to make peace with them.\nTo which the other replied, that they also wanted to settle conditions\nof peace with them, and sent men together with the Babylonians, who discoursed\nwith Anileus about them. But the Babylonians, upon taking a view of his\nsituation, and having learned where Anileus and his men lay, fell secretly\nupon them as they were drunk and fallen asleep, and slew all that they\ncaught of them, without any fear, and killed Anileus himself also.", "The Babylonians were now freed from Anileus's heavy incursions, which\nhad been a great restraint to the effects of that hatred they bore to the\nJews; for they were almost always at variance, by reason of the contrariety\nof their laws; and which party soever grew boldest before the other, they\nassaulted the other: and at this time in particular it was, that upon the\nruin of Anileus's party, the Babylonians attacked the Jews, which made\nthose Jews so, vehemently to resent the injuries they received from the\nBabylonians, that being neither able to fight them, nor bearing to live\nwith them, they went to Seleucia, the principal city of those parts, which\nwas built by Seleucus Nicator. It was inhabited by many of the Macedonians,\nbut by more of the Grecians; not a few of the Syrians also dwelt there;\nand thither did the Jews fly, and lived there five years, without any misfortunes.\nBut on the sixth year, a pestilence came upon these at Babylon, which occasioned\nnew removals of men's habitations out of that city; and because they came\nto Seleucia, it happened that a still heavier calamity came upon them on\nthat account which I am going to relate immediately.", "Now the way of living of the people of Seleucia, which were Greeks\nand Syrians, was commonly quarrelsome, and full of discords, though the\nGreeks were too hard for the Syrians. When, therefore, the Jews were come\nthither, and dwelt among them, there arose a sedition, and the Syrians\nwere too hard for the other, by the assistance of the Jews, who are men\nthat despise dangers, and very ready to fight upon any occasion. Now when\nthe Greeks had the worst in this sedition, and saw that they had but one\nway of recovering their former authority, and that was, if they could prevent\nthe agreement between the Jews and the Syrians, they every one discoursed\nwith such of the Syrians as were formerly their acquaintance, and promised\nthey would be at peace and friendship with them. Accordingly, they gladly\nagreed so to do; and when this was done by the principal men of both nations,\nthey soon agreed to a reconciliation; and when they were so agreed, they\nboth knew that the great design of such their union would be their common\nhatred to the Jews. Accordingly, they fell upon them, and slew about fifty\nthousand of them; nay, the Jews were all destroyed, excepting a few who\nescaped, either by the compassion which their friends or neighbors afforded\nthem, in order to let them fly away. These retired to Ctesiphon, a Grecian\ncity, and situate near to Seleucia, where the king [of Parthia] lives in\nwinter every year, and where the greatest part of his riches are reposited;\nbut the Jews had here no certain settlement, those of Seleucia having little\nconcern for the king's honor. Now the whole nation of the Jews were in\nfear both of the Babylonians and of the Seleucians, because all the Syrians\nthat live in those places agreed with the Seleucians in the war against\nthe Jews; so the most of them gathered themselves together, and went to\nNeerda and Nisibis, and obtained security there by the strength of those\ncities; besides which their inhabitants, who were a great many, were all\nwarlike men. And this was the state of the Jews at this time in Babylonia."]}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "19", "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "title", "@place": "inline", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Book XIX"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "title", "@place": "inline", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "CONTAINING THE INTERVAL OF THREE YEARS AND A HALF.\nFROM THE DEPARTURE OUT OF BABYLON TO FADUS, THE ROMAN\nPROCURATOR."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "sum", "@resp": "ed", "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "In this and the three next chapters we have, I think, a larger and more\ndistinct account of the slaughter of Caius, and the succession of Claudius,\nthan we have of any such ancient facts whatsoever elsewhere.

but suffered it\nto extend itself through all the earth and sea, so far as was in subjection\nto the Romans, and filled it with ten thousand mischiefs; so many indeed\nin number as no former history relates. But Rome itself felt the most dismal\neffects of what he did, while he deemed that not to be any way more honorable\nthan the rest of the cities; but he pulled and hauled its other citizens,\nbut especially the senate, and particularly the nobility, and such as had\nbeen dignified by illustrious ancestors; he also had ten thousand devices\nagainst such of the equestrian order, as it was styled, who were esteemed\nby the citizens equal in dignity and wealth with the senators, because\nout of them the senators were themselves chosen; these he treated after\nall ignominious manner, and removed them out of his way, while they were\nat once slain, and their wealth plundered, because he slew men generally\nin order to seize on their riches. He also asserted his own divinity, and\ninsisted on greater honors to be paid him by his subjects than are due\nto mankind. He also frequented that temple of Jupiter which they style\nthe Capitol, which is with them the most holy of all their temples, and\nhad boldness enough to call himself the brother of Jupiter. And other pranks\nhe did like a madman; as when he laid a bridge from the city Dicearchia,\nwhich belongs to Campania, to Misenum, another city upon the sea-side,\nfrom one promontory to another, of the length of thirty furlongs, as measured\nover the sea. And this was done because he esteemed it to be a most tedious\nthing to row over it in a small ship, and thought withal that it became\nhim to make that bridge, since he was lord of the sea, and might oblige\nit to give marks of obedience as well as the earth; so he enclosed the\nwhole bay within his bridge, and drove his chariot over it; and thought\nthat, as he was a god, it was fit for him to travel over such roads as\nthis was. Nor did he abstain from the plunder of any of the Grecian temples,\nand gave order that all the engravings and sculptures, and the rest of\nthe ornaments of the statues and donations therein dedicated, should be\nbrought to him, saying that the best things ought to be set no where but\nin the best place, and that the city of Rome was that best place. He also\nadorned his own house and his gardens with the curiosities brought from\nthose temples, together with the houses he lay at when he traveled all\nover Italy; whence he did not scruple to give a command that the statue\nof Jupiter Olympius, so called because he was honored at the Olympian games\nby the Greeks, which was the work of Phidias the Athenian, should be brought\nto Rome. Yet did not he compass his end, because the architects told Memmius\nRegulus, who was commanded to remove that statue of Jupiter, that the workmanship\nwas such as would be spoiled, and would not bear the removal. It was also\nreported that Memmius, both on that account, and on account of some such\nmighty prodigies as are of an incredible nature, put off the taking it\ndown, and wrote to Caius those accounts, as his apology for not having\ndone what his epistle required of him; and that when he was thence in danger\nof perishing, he was saved by Caius being dead himself, before he had put\nhim to death."}, "Nay, Caius's madness came to this height, that when he had a daughter\nborn, he carried her into the capitol, and put her upon the knees of the\nstatue, and said that the child was common to him and to Jupiter, and determined\nthat she had two fathers, but which of these fathers were the greatest\nhe left undetermined; and yet mankind bore him in such his pranks. He also\ngave leave to slaves to accuse their masters of any crimes whatsoever they\npleased; for all such accusations were terrible, because they were in great\npart made to please him, and at his suggestion, insomuch that Pollux, Claudius's\nslave, had the boldness to lay an accusation against Claudius himself;\nand Caius was not ashamed to be present at his trial of life and death,\nto hear that trial of his own uncle, in hopes of being able to take him\noff, although he did not succeed to his mind. But when he had filled the\nwhole habitable world which he governed with false accusations and miseries,\nand had occasioned the greatest insults of slaves against their masters,\nwho indeed in a great measure ruled them, there were many secret plots\nnow laid against him; some in anger, and in order for men to revenge themselves,\non account of the miseries they had already undergone from him; and others\nmade attempts upon him, in order to take him off before they should fall\ninto such great miseries, while his death came very fortunately for the\npreservation of the laws of all men, and had a great influence upon the\npublic welfare; and this happened most happily for our nation in particular,\nwhich had almost utterly perished if he had not been suddenly slain. And\nI confess I have a mind to give a full account of this matter particularly,\nbecause it will afford great assurance of the power of God, and great comfort\nto those that are under afflictions, and wise caution to those who think\ntheir happiness will never end, nor bring them at length to the most lasting\nmiseries, if they do not conduct their lives by the principles of virtue.", "Now there were three several conspiracies made in order to take off\nCaius, and each of these three were conducted by excellent persons. Emilius\nRegulus, born at Corduba in Spain, got some men together, and was desirous\nto take Caius off, either by them or by himself. Another conspiracy there\nwas laid by them, under the conduct of Cherea Cassius, the tribune [of\nthe Pretorian band]. Minucianus Annins was also one of great consequence\namong those that were prepared to oppose his tyranny. Now the several occasions\nof these men's several hatred and conspiracy against Caius were these:\nRegulus had indignation and hatred against all injustice, for he had a\nmind naturally angry, and bold, and free, which made him not conceal his\ncounsels; so he communicated them to many of his friends, and to others\nwho seemed to him persons of activity and vigor: Minucianus entered into\nthis conspiracy, because of the injustice done to Lepidus his particular\nfriend, and one of the best character of all the citizens, whom Caius had\nslain, as also because he was afraid of himself, since Caius's wrath tended\nto the slaughter of all alike: and for Cherea, he came in, because he thought\nit a deed worthy of a free ingenuous man to kill Caius, and was ashamed\nof the reproaches he lay under from Caius, as though he were a coward;\nas also because he was himself in danger every day from his friendship\nwith him, and the observance he paid him. These men proposed this attempt\nto all the rest that were concerned, who saw the injuries that were offered\nthem, and were desirous that Caius's slaughter might succeed by their mutual\nassistance of one another, and they might themselves escape being killed\nby the taking off Caius; that perhaps they should gain their point; and\nthat it would be a happy thing, if they should gain it, to approve themselves\nto so many excellent persons, as earnestly wished to be partakers with\nthem in their design for the delivery of the city and of the government,\neven at the hazard of their own lives. But still Cherea was the most zealous\nof them all, both out of a desire of getting himself the greatest name,\nand also by reason of his access to Caius's presence with less danger,\nbecause he was tribune, and could therefore the more easily kill him.", "Now at this time came on the horse-races [Circensian games]; the\nview of which games was eagerly desired by the people of Rome, for they\ncome with great alacrity into the hippodrome [circus] at such times, and\npetition their emperors, in great multitudes, for what they stand in need\nof; who usually did not think fit to deny them their requests, but readily\nand gratefully granted them. Accordingly, they most importunately desired\nthat Caius would now ease them in their tributes, and abate somewhat of\nthe rigor of their taxes imposed upon them; but he would not hear their\npetition; and when their clamors increased, he sent soldiers some one way\nand some another, and gave order that they should lay hold on those that\nmade the clamors, and without any more ado bring them out, and put them\nto death. These were Caius's commands, and those who were commanded executed\nthe same; and the number of those who were slain on this occasion was very\ngreat. Now the people saw this, and bore it so far, that they left off\nclamoring, because they saw with their own eyes that this petition to be\nrelieved, as to the payment of their money, brought immediate death upon\nthem. These things made Cherea more resolute to go on with his plot, in\norder to put an end to this barbarity of Caius against men. He then at\nseveral times thought to fall upon Caius, even as he was feasting; yet\ndid he restrain himself by some considerations; not that he had any doubt\non him about killing him, but as watching for a proper season, that the\nattempt might not be frustrated, but that he might give the blow so as\nmight certainly gain his purpose.", "Cherea had been in the army a long time, yet was he not pleased with\nconversing so much with Caius. But Caius had set him to require the tributes,\nand other dues, which, when not paid in due time, were forfeited to Caesar's\ntreasury; and he had made some delays in requiring them, because those\nburdens had been doubled, and had rather indulged his own mild disposition\nthan performed Caius's command; nay, indeed, be provoked Caius to anger\nby his sparing men, and pitying the hard fortunes of those from whom he\ndemanded the taxes; and Caius upbraided him with his sloth and effeminacy\nin being so long about collecting the taxes. And indeed he did not only\naffront him in other respects, but when he gave him the watchword of the\nday, to whom it was to be given by his place, he gave him feminine words,\nand those of a nature very reproachful; and these watchwords he gave out,\nas having been initiated in the secrets of certain mysteries, which he\nhad been himself the author of. Now although he had sometimes put on women's\nclothes, and had been wrapt in some embroidered garments to them belonging,\nand done a great many other things, in order to make the company mistake\nhim for a woman; yet did he, by way of reproach, object the like womanish\nbehavior to Cherea. But when Cherea received the watchword from him, he\nhad indignation at it, but had greater indignation at the delivery of it\nto others, as being laughed at by those that received it; insomuch that\nhis fellow tribunes made him the subject of their drollery; for they would\nforetell that he would bring them some of his usual watchwords when he\nwas about to take the watchword from Caesar, and would thereby make him\nridiculous; on which accounts he took the courage of assuming certain partners\nto him, as having just reasons for his indignation against Caius. Now there\nwas one Pompedius, a senator, and one who had gone through almost all posts\nin the government, but otherwise an Epicurean, and for that reason loved\nto lead an inactive life. Now Timidius, an enemy of his, had informed Caius\nthat he had used indecent reproaches against him, and he made use of Quintilia\nfor a witness to them; a woman she was much beloved by many that frequented\nthe theater, and particularly by Pompedius, on account of her great beauty.\nNow this woman thought it a horrible thing to attest to an accusation that\ntouched the life of her lover, which was also a lie. Timidius, however,\nwanted to have her brought to the torture. Caius was irritated at this\nreproach upon him, and commanded Cherea, without any delay, to torture\nQuintilia, as he used to employ Cherea in such bloody matters, and those\nthat required the torture, because he thought he would do it the more barbarously,\nin order to avoid that imputation of effeminacy which he had laid upon\nhim. But Quintilia, when she was brought to the rack, trod upon the foot\nof one of her associates, and let him know that he might be of good courage,\nand not be afraid of the consequence of her tortures, for that she would\nbear them with magnanimity. Cherea tortured this woman after a cruel manner;\nunwillingly indeed, but because he could not help it. He then brought her,\nwithout being in the least moved at what she had suffered, into the presence\nof Caius, and that in such a state as was sad to behold; and Caius, being\nsomewhat affected with the sight of Quintilia, who had her body miserably\ndisordered by the pains she had undergone, freed both her and Pompedius\nof the crime laid to their charge. He also gave her money to make her an\nhonorable amends, and comfort her for that maiming of her body which she\nhad suffered, and for her glorious patience under such insufferable torments.", "This matter sorely grieved Cherea, as having been the cause, as far\nas he could, or the instrument, of those miseries to men, which seemed\nworthy of consolation to Caius himself; on which account he said to Clement\nand to Papinius, (of whom Clement was general of the army, and Papinius\nwas a tribune,) \"To be sure, O Clement, we have no way failed in our\nguarding the emperor; for as to those that have made conspiracies against\nhis government, some have been slain by our care and pains, and some have\nbeen by us tortured, and this to such a degree, that he hath himself pitied\nthem. How great then is our virtue in submitting to conduct his armies!\"\nClement held his peace, but showed the shame he was under in obeying Caius's\norders, both by his eyes and his blushing countenance, while he thought\nit by no means right to accuse the emperor in express words, lest their\nown safety should be endangered thereby. Upon which Cherea took courage,\nand spake to him without fear of the dangers that were before him, and\ndiscoursed largely of the sore calamities under which the city and the\ngovernment then labored, and said, \"We may indeed pretend in words\nthat Caius is the person unto whom the cause of such miseries ought to\nbe imputed; but, in the opinion of such as are able to judge uprightly,\nit is I, O Clement! and this Papinius, and before us thou thyself, who\nbring these tortures upon the Romans, and upon all mankind. It is not done\nby our being subservient to the commands of Caius, but it is done by our\nown consent; for whereas it is in our power to put an end to the life of\nthis man, who hath so terribly injured the citizens and his subjects, we\nare his guard in mischief, and his executioners instead of his soldiers,\nand are the instruments of his cruelty. We bear these weapons, not for\nour liberty, not for the Roman government, but only for his preservation,\nwho hath enslaved both their bodies and their minds; and we are every day\npolluted with the blood that we shed, and the torments we inflict upon\nothers; and this we do, till somebody becomes Caius's instrument in bringing\nthe like miseries upon ourselves. Nor does he thus employ us because he\nhath a kindness for us, but rather because he hath a suspicion of us, as\nalso because when abundance more have been killed, (for Caius will set\nno bounds to his wrath, since he aims to do all, not out of regard to justice,\nbut to his own pleasure,) we shall also ourselves be exposed to his cruelty;\nwhereas we ought to be the means of confirming the security and liberty\nof all, and at the same time to resolve to free ourselves from dangers.\"", "Hereupon Clement openly commended Cherea's intentions, but bid him\nhold his tongue; for that in case his words should get out among many,\nand such things should be spread abroad as were fit to be concealed, the\nplot would come to be discovered before it was executed, and they should\nbe brought to punishment; but that they should leave all to futurity, and\nthe hope which thence arose, that some fortunate event would come to their\nassistance; that, as for himself, his age would not permit him to make\nany attempt in that case. \"However, although perhaps I could suggest\nwhat may be safer than what thou, Cherea, hast contrived and said, yet\ntrow is it possible for any one to suggest what is more for thy reputation?\"\nSo Clement went his way home, with deep reflections on what he had heard,\nand what he had himself said. Cherea also was under a concern, and went\nquickly to Cornelius Sabinus, who was himself one of the tribunes, and\nwhom he otherwise knew to be a worthy man, and a lover of liberty, and\non that account very uneasy at the present management of public affairs,\nhe being desirous to come immediately to the execution of what had been\ndetermined, and thinking it right for him to propose it to the other, and\nafraid lest Clement should discover them, and besides looking upon delays\nand puttings off to be the next to desisting from the enterprise.", "But as all was agreeable to Sabinus, who had himself, equally without\nCherea, the same design, but had been silent for want of a person to whom\nhe could safely communicate that design; so having now met with one, who\nnot only promised to conceal what he heard, but who had already opened\nhis mind to him, he was much more encouraged, and desired of Cherea that\nno delay might be made therein. Accordingly they went to Minucianus, who\nwas as virtuous a man, and as zealous to do glorious actions, as themselves,\nand suspected by Caius on occasion of the slaughter of Lepidus; for Minucianus\nand Lepidus were intimate friends, and both in fear of the dangers that\nthey were under; for Caius was terrible to all the great men, as appearing\nready to act a mad part towards each of them in particular, and towards\nall of: them in general; and these men were afraid of one another, while\nthey were yet uneasy at the posture of affairs, but avoided to declare\ntheir mind and their hatred against Caius to one another, out of fear of\nthe dangers they might be in thereby, although they perceived by other\nmeans their mutual hatred against Caius, and on that account were not averse\nto a mutual kindness one towards another.", "When Minuetanus and Cherea had met together, and saluted one another,\n(as they had been used on former conversations to give the upper hand to\nMinucianus, both on account of his eminent dignity, for he was the noblest\nof all the citizens, and highly commended by all men, especially when he\nmade speeches to them,) Minuetanus began first, and asked Cherea, What\nwas the watchword he had received that day from Caius; for the affront\nwhich was offered Cherea, in giving the watchwords, was famous over the\ncity. But Cherea made no delay so long as to reply to that question, out\nof the joy he had that Minueianus would have such confidence in him as\nto discourse with him. \"But do thou,\" said he, \"give me\nthe watchword of liberty. And I return thee my thanks that thou hast so\ngreatly encouraged me to exert myself after an extraordinary manner; nor\ndo I stand in need of many words to encourage me, since both thou and I\nare of the same mind, and partakers of the same resolutions, and this before\nwe have conferred together. I have indeed but one sword girt on, but this\none will serve us both. Come on, therefore, let us set about the work.\nDo thou go first, if thou hast a mind, and bid me follow thee; or else\nI will go first, and thou shalt assist me, and we will assist one another,\nand trust one another. Nor is there a necessity for even one sword to such\nas have a mind disposed to such works, by which mind the sword uses to\nbe successful. I am zealous about this action, nor am I solicitous what\nI may myself undergo; for I can not at leisure to consider the dangers\nthat may come upon myself, so deeply am I troubled at the slavery our once\nfree country is now under, and at the contempt cast upon our excellent\nlaws, and at the destruction which hangs over all men, by the means of\nCaius. I wish that I may be judged by thee, and that thou mayst esteem\nme worthy of credit in these matters, seeing we are both of the same opinion,\nand there is herein no difference between us.\"", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Just such a voice as this is related to be came, and from an unknown original\nalso, to the famous Polycarp, as he was going to martyrdom, bidding him\n\"play the man;\" as the church of Smyrna assures us in their account\nof that his martyrdom, sect. 9."}, "#text": "When Minucianus saw the vehemency with which Cherea delivered himself,\nhe gladly embraced him, and encouraged him in his bold attempt, commending\nhim, and embracing him; so he let him go with his good wishes; and some\naffirm that he thereby confirmed Minuclanus in the prosecution of what\nhad been agreed among them; for as Cherea entered into the court, the report\nruns, that a voice came from among the multitude to encourage him, which\nbid him finish what he was about, and take the opportunity that Providence\nafforded; and that Cherea at first suspected that some one of the conspirators\nhad betrayed him, and he was caught, but at length perceived that it was\nby way of exhortation. Whether somebody \nthat was conscious of what he was about, gave a signal for his encouragement,\nor whether it was God himself, who looks upon the actions of men, that\nencouraged him to go on boldly in his design, is uncertain. The plot was\nnow communicated to a great many, and they were all in their armor; some\nof the conspirators being senators, and some of the equestrian order, and\nas many of the soldiery as were made acquainted with it; for there was\nnot one of them who would not reckon it a part of his happiness to kill\nCaius; and on that account they were all very zealous in the affair, by\nwhat means soever any one could come at it, that he might not be behindhand\nin these virtuous designs, but might be ready with all his alacrity or\npower, both by words and actions, to complete this slaughter of a tyrant.\nAnd besides these, Callistus also, who was a freed-man of Caius, and was\nthe only man that had arrived at the greatest degree of power under him,\n- such a power, indeed, as was in a manner equal to the power of the tyrant\nhimself, by the dread that all men had of him, and by the great riches\nhe had acquired; for he took bribes most plenteously, and committed injuries\nwithout bounds, and was more extravagant in the use of his power in unjust\nproceedings than any other. He also knew the disposition of Caius to be\nimplacable, and never to be turned from what he had resolved on. He had\nwithal many other reasons why he thought himself in danger, and the vastness\nof his wealth was not one of the least of them; on which account he privately\ningratiated himself with Claudius, and transferred his courtship to him,\nout of this hope, that in case, upon the removal of Caius, the government\nshould come to him, his interest in such changes should lay a foundation\nfor his preserving his dignity under him, since he laid in beforehand a\nstock of merit, and did Claudius good offices in his promotion. He had\nalso the boldness to pretend that he had been persuaded to make away with\nClaudius, by poisoning him, but had still invented ten thousand excuses\nfor delaying to do it. But it seems probable to me that Callistus only\ncounterfeited this, in order to ingratiate himself with Claudius; for if\nCaius had been in earnest resolved to take off Claudius, he would not have\nadmitted of Callistus's excuses; nor would Callistus, if he had been enjoined\nto do such an act as was desired by Caius, have put it off; nor if he had\ndisobeyed those injunctions of his master, had he escaped immediate punishment;\nwhile Claudius was preserved from the madness of Caius by a certain Divine\nprovidence, and Callistus pretended to such a piece of merit as he no way\ndeserved."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Here Josephus supposes that it was Augustus, and not Julius Caesar, who\nfirst changed the Roman commonwealth into a monarchy; for these shows were\nin honor of Augustus, as we shall learn in the next section."}, "#text": "However, the execution of Cherea's designs was put off from day\nto day, by the sloth of many therein concerned; for as to Cherea himself,\nhe would not willingly make any delay in that execution, thinking every\ntime a fit time for it; for frequent opportunities offered themselves;\nas when Caius went up to the capitol to sacrifice for his daughter, or\nwhen he stood upon his royal palace, and threw gold and silver pieces of\nmoney among the people, he might be pushed down headlong, because the top\nof the palace, that looks towards the market-place, was very high; and\nalso when he celebrated the mysteries, which he had appointed at that time;\nfor he was then no way secluded from the people, but solicitous to do every\nthing carefully and decently, and was free from all suspicion that he should\nbe then assaulted by any body; and although the gods should afford him\nno divine assistance to enable him to take away his life, yet had he strength\nhimself sufficient to despatch Caius, even without a sword. Thus was Chorea\nangry at his fellow conspirators, for fear they should suffer a proper\nopportunity to pass by; and they were themselves sensible that he had just\ncause to be angry at them, and that his eagerness was for their advantage;\nyet did they desire he would have a little longer patience, lest, upon\nany disappointment they might meet with, they should put the city into\ndisorder, and an inquisition should be made after the conspiracy, and should\nrender the courage of those that were to attack Caius without success,\nwhile he would then secure himself more carefully than ever against them;\nthat it would therefore be the best to set about the work when the shows\nwere exhibited in the palace. These shows were acted in honor of that Caesar\n who\nfirst of all changed the popular government, and transferred it to himself;\ngalleries being fixed before the palace, where the Romans that were patricians\nbecame spectators, together with their children and their wives, and Caesar\nhimself was to be also a spectator; and they reckoned, among those many\nten thousands who would there be crowded into a narrow compass, they should\nhave a favorable opportunity to make their attempt upon him as he came\nin, because his guards that should protect him, if any of them should have\na mind to do it, would not here be able to give him any assistance."}, "Cherea consented to this delay; and when the shows were exhibited,\nit was resolved to do the work the first day. But fortune, which allowed\na further delay to his slaughter, was too hard for their foregoing resolution;\nand as three days of the regular times for these shows were now over, they\nhad much ado to get the business done on the last day. Then Cherea called\nthe conspirators together, and spake thus to them: \"So much time passed\naway without effort is a reproach to us, as delaying to go through such\na virtuous design as we are engaged in; but more fatal will this delay\nprove if we be discovered, and the design be frustrated; for Caius will\nthen become more cruel in his unjust proceedings. Do we not see how long\nwe deprive all our friends of their liberty, and give Caius leave still\nto tyrannize over them? while we ought to have procured them security for\nthe future, and, by laying a foundation for the happiness of others, gain\nto ourselves great admiration and honor for all time to come.\" Now\nwhile the conspirators had nothing tolerable to say by way of contradiction,\nand yet did not quite relish what they were doing, but stood silent and\nastonished, he said further, \"O my brave comrades! why do we make\nsuch delays? Do not you see that this is the last day of these shows, and\nthat Caius is about to go to sea? for he is preparing to sail to Alexandria,\nin order to see Egypt. Is it therefore for your honor to let a man go out\nof your hands who is a reproach to mankind, and to permit him to go, after\na pompous manner, triumphing both at land and sea? Shall not we be justly\nashamed of ourselves, if we give leave to some Egyptian or other, who shall\nthink his injuries insufferable to free-men, to kill him? As for myself,\nI will no longer bear your stow proceedings, but will expose myself to\nthe dangers of the enterprise this very day, and bear cheerfully whatsoever\nshall be the consequence of the attempt; nor, let them be ever so great,\nwill I put them off any longer: for, to a wise and courageous man, what\ncan be more miserable than that, while I am alive, any one else should\nkill Caius, and deprive me of the honor of so virtuous an action?\"", "When Cherea had spoken thus, he zealously set about the work, and\ninspired courage into the rest to go on with it, and they were all eager\nto fall to it without further delay. So he was at the palace in the morning,\nwith his equestrian sword girt on him; for it was the custom that the tribunes\nshould ask for the watchword with their swords on, and this was the day\non which Cherea was, by custom, to receive the watchword; and the multitude\nwere already come to the palace, to be soon enough for seeing the shows,\nand that in great crowds, and one tumultuously crushing another, while\nCaius was delighted with this eagerness of the multitude; for which reason\nthere was no order observed in the seating men, nor was any peculiar place\nappointed for the senators, or for the equestrian order; but they sat at\nrandom, men and women together, and free-men were mixed with the slaves.\nSo Caius came out in a solemn manner, and offered sacrifice to Augustus\nCaesar, in whose honor indeed these shows were celebrated. Now it happened,\nupon the fall of a certain priest, that the garment of Asprenas, a senator,\nwas filled with blood, which made Caius laugh, although this was an evident\nomen to Asprenas, for he was slain at the same time with Caius. It is also\nrelated that Caius was that day, contrary to his usual custom, so very\naffable and good-natured in his conversation, that every one of those that\nwere present were astonished at it. After the sacrifice was over, Caius\nbetook himself to see the shows, and sat down for that purpose, as did\nalso the principal of his friends sit near him. Now the parts of the theater\nwere so fastened together, as it used to be every year, in the manner following:\nIt had two doors, the one door led to the open air, the other was for going\ninto, or going out of, the cloisters, that those within the theater might\nnot be thereby disturbed; but out of one gallery there went an inward passage,\nparted into partitions also, which led into another gallery, to give room\nto the combatants and to the musicians to go out as occasion served. When\nthe multitude were set down, and Cherea, with the other tribunes, were\nset down also, and the right corner of the theater was allotted to Caesar,\none Vatinius, a senator, commander of the praetorian band, asked of Cluvius,\none that sat by him, and was of consular dignity also, whether he had heard\nany thing of news, or not? but took care that nobody should hear what he\nsaid; and when Cluvius replied, that he had heard no news, \"Know then,\"\nsaid Vatinius, \"that the game of the slaughter of tyrants is to be\nplayed this dav.\" But Cluvius replied \"O brave comrade hold thy\npeace, lest some other of the Achaians hear thy tale.\" And as there\nwas abundance of autumnal fruit thrown among the spectators, and a great\nnumber of birds, that were of great value to such as possessed them, on\naccount of their rareness, Caius was pleased with the birds fighting for\nthe fruits, and with the violence wherewith the spectators seized upon\nthem: and here he perceived two prodigies that happened there; for an actor\nwas introduced, by whom a leader of robbers was crucified, and the pantomime\nbrought in a play called Cinyras, wherein he himself was to be slain, as\nwell as his daughter Myrrha, and wherein a great deal of fictitious blood\nwas shed, both about him that was crucified, and also about Cinyras. It\nwas also confessed that this was the same day wherein Pausanias, a friend\nof Philip, the son of Amyntas, who was king of Macedonia, slew him, as\nhe was entering into the theater. And now Caius was in doubt whether he\nshould tarry to the end of the shows, because it was the last day, or whether\nhe should not go first to the bath, and to dinner, and then return and\nsit down as before. Hereupon Minucianus, who sat over Caius, and was afraid\nthat the opportunity should fail them, got up, because he saw Cherea was\nalready gone out, and made haste out, to confirm him in his resolution;\nbut Caius took hold of his garment, in an obliging way, and said to him,\n\"O brave man! whither art thou going?\" Whereupon, out of reverence\nto Caesar, as it seemed, he sat down again; but his fear prevailed over\nhim, and in a little time he got up again, and then Caius did no way oppose\nhis going out, as thinking that he went out to perform some necessities\nof nature. And Asprenas, who was one of the confederates, persuaded Caius\nto go out to the bath, and to dinner, and then to come in again, as desirous\nthat what had been resolved on might be brought to a conclusion immediately.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Suetonius says Caius was slain about the seventh hour of the day, the ninth.\nThe series of the narration favors Josephus."}, "#text": "So Cherea's associates placed themselves in order, as the time would\npermit them, and they were obliged to labor hard, that the place which\nwas appointed them should not be left by them; but they had an indignation\nat the tediousness of the delays, and that what they were about should\nbe put off any longer, for it was already about the ninth \nhour of the day; and Cherea, upon Caius's tarrying so long, had a great\nmind to go in, and fall upon him in his seat, although he foresaw that\nthis could not be done without much bloodshed, both of the senators, and\nof those of the equestrian order that were present; and although he knew\nthis must happen, yet had he a great mind to do so, as thinking it a right\nthing to procure security and freedom to all, at the expense of such as\nmight perish at the same time. And as they were just going back into the\nentrance to the theater, word was brought them that Caius was arisen, whereby\na tumult was made; hereupon the conspirators thrust away the crowd, under\npretense as if Caius was angry at them, but in reality as desirous to have\na quiet place, that should have none in it to defend him, while they set\nabout Caius's slaughter. Now Claudius, his uncle, was gone out before,\nand Marcus Vinicius his sister's husband, as also Valellus of Asia; whom\nthough they had had such a mind to put out of their places, the reverence\nto their dignity hindered them so to do; then followed Caius, with Paulus\nArruntius: and because Caius was now gotten within the palace, he left\nthe direct road, along which those his servants stood that were in waiting,\nand by which road Claudius had gone out before, Caius turned aside into\na private narrow passage, in order to go to the place for bathing, as also\nin order to take a view of the boys that came out of Asia, who were sent\nthence, partly to sing hymns in these mysteries which were now celebrated,\nand partly to dance in the Pyrrhic way of dancing upon the theatres. So\nCherea met him, and asked him for the watchword; upon Caius's giving him\none of his ridiculous words, he immediately reproached him, and drew his\nsword, and gave him a terrible stroke with it, yet was not this stroke\nmortal. And although there be those that say it was so contrived on purpose\nby Chorea, that Caius should not be killed at one blow, but should be punished\nmore severely by a multitude of wounds; yet does this story appear to me\nincredible, because the fear men are under in such actions does not allow\nthem to use their reason. And if Cherea was of that mind, I esteem him\nthe greatest of all fools, in pleasing himself in his spite against Caius,\nrather than immediately procuring safety to himself and to his confederates\nfrom the dangers they were in, because there might many things still happen\nfor helping Caius's escape, if he had not already given up the ghost; for\ncertainly Cherea would have regard, not so much to the punishment of Caius,\nas to the affliction himself and his friends were in, while it was in his\npower, after such success, to keep silent, and to escape the wrath of Caius's\ndefenders, and not to leave it to uncertainty whether he should gain the\nend he aimed at or not, and after an unreasonable manner to act as if he\nhad a mind to ruin himself, and lose the opportunity that lay before him.\nBut every body may guess as he please about this matter. However, Caius\nwas staggered with the pain that the blow gave him; for the stroke of the\nsword falling in the middle, between the shoulder and the neck, was hindered\nby the first bone of the breast from proceeding any further. Nor did he\neither cry out, (in such astonishment was he,) nor did he call out for\nany of his friends; whether it were that he had no confidence in them,\nor that his mind was otherwise disordered, but he groaned under the pain\nhe endured, and presently went forward and fled; when Cornelius Sabinus,\nwho was already prepared in his mind so to do, thrust him down upon his\nknee, where many of them stood round about him, and struck him with their\nswords; and they cried out, and encouraged one another all at once to strike\nhim again; but all agree that Aquila gave him the finishing stroke, which\ndirectly killed him. But one may justly ascribe this act to Cherea; for\nalthough many concurred in the act itself, yet was he the first contriver\nof it, and began long before all the rest to prepare for it, and was the\nfirst man that boldly spake of it to the rest; and upon their admission\nof what he said about it, he got the dispersed conspirators together; he\nprepared every thing after a prudent manner, and by suggesting good advice,\nshowed himself far superior to the rest, and made obliging speeches to\nthem, insomuch that he even compelled them all to go on, who otherwise\nhad not courage enough for that purpose; and when opportunity served to\nuse his sword in hand, he appeared first of all ready so to do, and gave\nthe first blow in this virtuous slaughter; he also brought Caius easily\ninto the power of the rest, and almost killed him himself, insomuch that\nit is but just to ascribe all that the rest did to the advice, and bravery,\nand labors of the hands of Cherea."}, "Thus did Caius come to his end, and lay dead, by the many wounds\nwhich had been given him. Now Cherea and his associates, upon Caius's slaughter,\nsaw that it was impossible for them to save themselves, if they should\nall go the same way, partly on account of the astonishment they were under;\nfor it was no small danger they had incurred by killing an emperor, who\nwas honored and loved by the madness of the people, especially when the\nsoldiers were likely to make a bloody inquiry after his murderers. The\npassages also were narrow wherein the work was done, which were also crowded\nwith a great multitude of Caius's attendants, and of such of the soldiers\nas were of the emperor's guard that day; whence it was that they went by\nother ways, and came to the house of Germanicus, the father of Caius, whom\nthey had now killed (which house adjoined to the palace; for while the\nedifice was one, it was built in its several parts by those particular\npersons who had been emperors, and those parts bare the names of those\nthat built them or the name of him who had begun to build its parts). So\nthey got away from the insults of the multitude, and then were for the\npresent out of danger, that is, so long as the misfortune which had overtaken\nthe emperor was not known. The Germans were the first who perceived that\nCaius was slain. These Germans were Caius's guard, and carried the name\nof the country whence they were chosen, and composed the Celtic legion.\nThe men of that country are naturally passionate, which is commonly the\ntemper of some other of the barbarous nations also, as being not used to\nconsider much about what they do; they are of robust bodies and fall upon\ntheir enemies as soon as ever they are attacked by them; and which way\nsoever they go, they perform great exploits. When, therefore, these German\nguards understood that Caius was slain, they were very sorry for it, because\nthey did not use their reason in judging about public affairs, but measured\nall by the advantages themselves received, Caius being beloved by them\nbecause of the money he gave them, by which he had purchased their kindness\nto him; so they drew their swords, and Sabinus led them on. He was one\nof the tribunes, not by the means of the virtuous actions of his pro genitors,\nfor he bad been a gladiator, but he had obtained that post in the army\nby his having a robust body. So these Germans marched along the houses\nin quest of Caesar's murderers, and cut Asprenas to pieces, because he\nwas the first man they fell upon, and whose garment it was that the blood\nof the sacrifices stained, as I have said already, and which foretold that\nthis his meeting the soldiers would not be for his good. Then did Norbanus\nmeet them, who was one of the principal nobility of and could show many\ngenerals of armies among his ancestors; but they paid no regard to his\ndignity; yet was he of such great strength, that he wrested the sword of\nthe first of those that assaulted him out of his hands, and appeared plainly\nnot to be willing to die without a struggle for his life, until he was\nsurrounded by a great number of assailants, and died by the multitude of\nthe wounds which they gave him. The third man was Anteius, a senator, and\na few others with him. He did not meet with these Germans by chance, as\nthe rest did before, but came to show his hatred to Caius, and because\nhe loved to see Caius lie dead with his own eyes, and took a pleasure in\nthat sight; for Caius had banished Anteius's father, who was of the same\nname with himself, and being not satisfied with that, he sent out his soldiers,\nand slew him; so he was come to rejoice at the sight of him, now he was\ndead. But as the house was now all in a tumult, when he was aiming to hide\nhimself, he could not escape that accurate search which the Germans made,\nwhile they barbarously slew those that were guilty, and those that were\nnot guilty, and this equally also. And thus were these [three] persons\nslain.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The rewards proposed by the Roman laws to informers was sometimes an eigth\npartm as Spanheim assures us, from the criminal's goods, as here, and sometimes\na fourth part."}, "#text": "But when the rumor that Caius was slain reached the theater, they\nwere astonished at it, and could not believe it; even some that entertained\nhis destruction with great pleasure, and were more desirous of its happening\nthan almost any other faction that could come to them, were under such\na fear, that they could not believe it. There were also those who greatly\ndistrusted it, because they were unwilling that any such thing should come\nto Caius, nor could believe it, though it were ever so true, because they\nthought no man could possibly so much power as to kill Caius. These were\nthe women, and the children, and the slaves, and some of the soldiery.\nThis last sort had taken his pay, and in a manner tyrannized with him,\nand had abused the best of the citizens, in being subservient to his unjust\ncommands, in order to gain honors and advantages to themselves; but for\nthe women and the youth, they had been inveigled with shows, and the fighting\nof the gladiators, and certain distributions of flesh-meat among them,\nwhich things them pretense were designed for the pleasing of multitude,\nbut in reality to satiate the barbarous cruelty and madness of Caius. The\nslaves also were sorry, because they were by Caius allowed to accuse and\nto despise their masters, and they could have recourse to his assistance\nwhen they had unjustly affronted them; for he was very easy in believing\nthem against their masters, even when they the city, accused them falsely;\nand if they would discover what money their masters had, they might soon\nobtain both riches and liberty, as the rewards of their accusations, because\nthe reward of these informers was the eighth \npart of the criminal's substance. As to the nobles, although the report\nappeared credible to some of them, either because they knew of the plot\nbeforehand, or because they wished it might be true; however, they concealed\nnot only the joy they had at the relation of it, but that they had heard\nany thing at all about it. These last acted so out of the fear they had,\nthat if the report proved false, they should be punished, for having so\nsoon let men know their minds. But those that knew Caius was dead, because\nthey were partners with the conspirators, they concealed all still more\ncautiously, as not knowing one another's minds; and fearing lest they should\nspeak of it to some of those to whom the continuance of tyranny was advantageous;\nand if Caius should prove to be alive, they might be informed against,\nand punished. And another report went about, that although Caius had been\nwounded indeed, yet was not he dead, but alive still, and under the physician's\nhands. Nor was any one looked upon by another as faithful enough to be\ntrusted, and to whom any one would open his mind; for he was either a friend\nto Caius, and therefore suspected to favor his tyranny, or he was one that\nhated him, who therefore might be suspected to deserve the less credit,\nbecause of his ill-will to him. Nay, it was said by some (and this indeed\nit was that deprived the nobility of their hopes, and made them sad) that\nCaius was in a condition to despise the dangers he had been in, and took\nno care of healing his wounds, but was gotten away into the market-place,\nand, bloody as he was, was making an harangue to the people. And these\nwere the conjectural reports of those that were so unreasonable as to endeavor\nto raise tumults, which they turned different ways, according to the opinions\nof the bearers. Yet did they not leave their seats, for fear of being accused,\nif they should go out before the rest; for they should not be sentenced\naccording to the real intention with which they went out, but according\nto the supposals of the accusers and of the judges."}, "But now a multitude of Germans had surrounded the theater with their\nswords drawn: all the spectators looked for nothing but death, and at every\none coming in a fear seized upon them, as if they were to be cut in pieces\nimmediately; and in great distress they were, as neither having courage\nenough to go out of the theater, nor believing themselves safe from dangers\nif they tarried there. And when the Germans came upon them, the cry was\nso great, that the theater rang again with the entreaties of the spectators\nto the soldiers, pleading that they were entirely ignorant of every thing\nthat related to such seditious contrivances, and that if there were any\nsedition raised, they knew nothing of it; they therefore begged that they\nwould spare them, and not punish those that had not the least hand in such\nbold crimes as belonged to other persons, while they neglected to search\nafter such as had really done whatsoever it be that hath been done. Thus\ndid these people appeal to God, and deplore their infelicity with shedding\nof tears, and beating their faces, and said every thing that the most imminent\ndanger and the utmost concern for their lives could dictate to them. This\nbrake the fury of the soldiers, and made them repent of what they minded\nto do to the spectators, which would have been the greatest instance of\ncruelty. And so it appeared to even these savages, when they had once fixed\nthe heads of those that were slain with Asprenas upon the altar; at which\nsight the spectators were sorely afflicted, both upon the consideration\nof the dignity of the persons, and out of a commiseration of their sufferings;\nnay, indeed, they were almost in as great disorder at the prospect of the\ndanger themselves were in, seeing it was still uncertain whether they should\nentirely escape the like calamity. Whence it was that such as thoroughly\nand justly hated Caius could yet no way enjoy the pleasure of his death,\nbecause they were themselves in jeopardy of perishing together with him;\nnor had they hitherto any firm assurance of surviving.", "There was at this time one Euaristus Arruntius, a public crier in\nthe market, and therefore of a strong and audible voice, who vied in wealth\nwith the richest of the Romans, and was able to do what he pleased in the\ncity, both then and afterward. This man put himself into the most mournful\nhabit he could, although he had a greater hatred against Caius than any\none else; his fear and his wise contrivance to gain his safety taught him\nso to do, and prevailed over his present pleasure; so he put on such a\nmournful dress as he would have done had he lost his dearest friends in\nthe world; this man came into the theater, and informed them of the death\nof Caius, and by this means put an end to that state of ignorance the men\nhad been in. Arruntius also went round about the pillars, and called out\nto the Germans, as did the tribunes with him, bidding them put up their\nswords, and telling them that Caius was dead. And this proclamation it\nwas plainly which saved those that were collected together in the theater,\nand all the rest who any way met the Germans; for while they had hopes\nthat Caius had still any breath in him, they abstained from no sort of\nmischief; and such an abundant kindness they still had for Caius, that\nthey would willingly have prevented the plot against him, and procured\nhis escape from so sad a misfortune, at the expense of their own lives.\nBut they now left off the warm zeal they had to punish his enemies, now\nthey were fully satisfied that Caius was dead, because it was now in vain\nfor them to show their zeal and kindness to him, when he who should reward\nthem was perished. They were also afraid that they should be punished by\nthe senate, if they should go on in doing such injuries; that is, in case\nthe authority of the supreme governor should revert to them.

Now the senate, during this interval, had met, and the people also\nassembled together in the accustomed form, and were both employed in searching\nafter the murderers of Caius.

As for myself, I cannot remember our\nformer time of liberty, as being born after it was gone; but I am beyond\nmeasure filled with joy at the thoughts of our present freedom. I also\nesteem those that were born and bred up in that our former liberty happy\nmen, and that those men are worthy of no less esteem than the gods themselves\nwho have given us a taste of it in this age; and I heartily wish that this\nquiet enjoyment of it, which we have at present, might continue to all\nages. However, this single day may suffice for our youth, as well as for\nus that are in years. It will seem an age to our old men, if they might\ndie during its happy duration: it may also be for the instruction of the\nyounger sort, what kind of virtue those men, from whose loins we are derived,\nwere exercised in. As for ourselves, our business is, during the space\nof time, to live virtuously, than which nothing can be more to our advantage;\nwhich course of virtue it is alone that can preserve our liberty; for as\nto our ancient state, I have heard of it by the relations of others; but\nas to our later state, during my lifetime, I have known it by experience,\nand learned thereby what mischiefs tyrannies have brought upon this commonwealth,\ndiscouraging all virtue, and depriving persons of magnanimity of their\nliberty, and proving the teachers of flattery and slavish fear, because\nit leaves the public administration not to be governed by wise laws, but\nby the humor of those that govern. For since Julius Caesar took it into\nhis head to dissolve our democracy, and, by overbearing the regular system\nof our laws, to bring disorders into our administration, and to get above\nright and justice, and to be a slave to his own inclinations, there is\nno kind of misery but what hath tended to the subversion of this city;\nwhile all those that have succeeded him have striven one with another to\noverthrow the ancient laws of their country, and have left it destitute\nof such citizens as were of generous principles, because they thought it\ntended to their safety to have vicious men to converse withal, and not\nonly to break the spirits of those that were best esteemed for their virtue,\nbut to resolve upon. their utter destruction. Of all which emperors, who\nhave been many in number, and who laid upon us insufferable hardships during\nthe times of their government, this Caius, who hath been slain today, hath\nbrought more terrible calamities upon us than did all the rest, not only\nby exercising his ungoverned rage upon his fellow citizens, but also upon\nhis kindred and friends, and alike upon all others, and by inflicting still\ngreater miseries upon them, as punishments, which they never deserved,\nhe being equally furious against men and against the gods. For tyrants\nare not content to gain their sweet pleasure, and this by acting injuriously,\nand in the vexation they bring both upon men's estates and their wives;\nbut they look upon that to be their principal advantage, when they can\nutterly overthrow the entire families of their enemies; while all lovers\nof liberty are the enemies of tyranny. Nor can those that patiently endure\nwhat miseries they bring on them gain their friendship; for as they are\nconscious of the abundant mischiefs they have brought on these men, and\nhow magnanimously they have borne their hard fortunes, they cannot but\nbe sensible what evils they have done, and thence only depend on security\nfrom what they are suspicious of, if it may be in their power to take them\nquite out of the world. Since, then, we are now gotten clear of such great\nmisfortunes, and are only accountable to one another, (which form of government\naffords us the best assurance of our present concord, and promises us the\nbest security from evil designs, and will be most for our own glory in\nsettling the city in good order,) you ought, every one of you in particular,\nto make provision for his own, and in general for the public utility: or,\non the contrary, they may declare their dissent to such things as have\nbeen proposed, and this without any hazard of danger to come upon them,\nbecause they have now no lord set over them, who, without fear of punishment,\ncould do mischief to the city, and had an uncontrollable power to take\noff those that freely declared their opinions. Nor has any thing so much\ncontributed to this increase of tyranny of late as sloth, and a timorous\nforbearance of contradicting the emperor's will; while men had an over-great\ninclination to the sweetness of peace, and had learned to live like slaves;\nand as many of us as either heard of intolerable calamities that happened\nat a distance from us, or saw the miseries that were near us, out of the\ndread of dying virtuously, endured a death joined with the utmost infamy.\nWe ought, then, in the first place, to decree the greatest honors we are\nable to those that have taken off the tyrant, especially to Cherea Cassius;\nfor this one man, with the assistance of the gods, hath, by his counsel\nand by his actions, been the procurer of our liberty. Nor ought we to forget\nhim now we have recovered our liberty, who, under the foregoing tyranny,\ntook counsel beforehand, and beforehand hazarded himself for our liberties;\nbut ought to decree him proper honors, and thereby freely declare that\nhe from the beginning acted with our approbation. And certainly it is a\nvery excellent thing, and what becomes free-men, to requite their benefactors,\nas this man hath been a benefactor to us all, though not at all like Cassius\nand Brutus, who slew Caius Julius [Caesar]; for those men laid the foundations\nof sedition and civil wars in our city; but this man, together with his\nslaughter of the tyrant, hath set our city free from all those sad miseries\nwhich arose from the tyranny.\""}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "date": {"@value": "41", "#text": "41"}, "#text": "Hence we learn that, in the opinion of Saturninus, the sovereign authority\nof the consuls and senate had been taken away just a hundred years before\nthe death of Caius, A.D. , or in the sixtieth year before the Christian\nsaga, when the first triumvirate began under Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus."}, "#text": "And this was the purport of Sentius's oration, \nwhich was received with pleasure by the senators, and by as many of the\nequestrian order as were present.

These facts were the subjects\nof admiration to themselves, and almost incredible; for it was a hundred\nyears since the democracy had been laid aside, when this giving the watchword\nreturned to the consuls; for before the city was subject to tyrants, they\nwere the commanders of the soldiers. But when Cherea had received that\nwatchword, he delivered it to those who were on the senate's side, which\nwere four regiments, who esteemed the government without emperors to be\npreferable to tyranny. So these went away with their tribunes. The people\nalso now departed very joyful, full of hope and of courage, as having recovered\ntheir former democracy, and were no longer under an emperor; and Cherea\nwas in very great esteem with them."}, "And now Cherea was very uneasy that Caius's daughter and wife were\nstill alive, and that all his family did not perish with him, since whosoever\nwas left of them must be left for the ruin of the city and of the laws.\nMoreover, in order to finish this matter with the utmost zeal, and in order\nto satisfy his hatred of Caius, he sent Julius Lupus, one of the tribunes,\nto kill Caius's wife and daughter. They proposed this office to Lupus as\nto a kinsman of Clement, that he might be so far a partaker of this murder\nof the tyrant, and might rejoice in the virtue of having assisted his fellow\ncitizens, and that he might appear to have been a partaker with those that\nwere first in their designs against him. Yet did this action appear to\nsome of the conspirators to be too cruel, as to this using such severity\nto a woman, because Caius did more indulge his own ill-nature than use\nher advice in all that he did; from which ill-nature it was that the city\nwas in so desperate a condition with the miseries that were brought on\nit, and the flower of the city was destroyed. But others accused her of\ngiving her consent to these things; nay, they ascribed all that Caius had\ndone to her as the cause of it, and said she had given a potion to Caius,\nwhich had made him obnoxious to her, and had tied him down to love her\nby such evil methods; insomuch that she, having rendered him distracted,\nwas become the author of all the mischiefs that had befallen the Romans,\nand that habitable world which was subject to them. So that at length it\nwas determined that she must die; nor could those of the contrary opinion\nat all prevail to have her saved; and Lupus was sent accordingly. Nor was\nthere any delay made in executing what he went about, but he was subservient\nto those that sent him on the first opportunity, as desirous to be no way\nblameable in what might be done for the advantage of the people. So when\nhe was come into the palace, he found Cesonia, who was Caius's wife, lying\nby her husband's dead body, which also lay down on the ground, and destitute\nof all such things as the law allows to the dead, and all over herself\nbesmeared with the blood of her husband's wounds, and bewailing the great\naffliction she was under, her daughter lying by her also; and nothing else\nwas heard in these her circumstances but her complaint of Caius, as if\nhe had not regarded what she had often told him of beforehand; which words\nof hers were taken in a different sense even at that time, and are now\nesteemed equally ambiguous by those that hear of them, and are still interpreted\naccording to the different inclinations of people. Now some said that the\nwords denoted that she had advised him to leave off his mad behavior and\nhis barbarous cruelty to the citizens, and to govern the public with moderation\nand virtue, lest he should perish by the same way, upon their using him\nas he had used them. But some said, that as certain words had passed concerning\nthe conspirators, she desired Caius to make no delay, but immediately to\nput them all to death, and this whether they were guilty or not, and that\nthereby he would be out of the fear of any danger; and that this was what\nshe reproached him for, when she advised him so to do, but he was too slow\nand tender in the matter. And this was what Cesonia said, and what the\nopinions of men were about it. But when she saw Lupus approach, she showed\nhim Caius's dead body, and persuaded him to come nearer, with lamentation\nand tears; and as she perceived that Lupus was in disorder, and approached\nher in order to execute some design disagreeable to himself, she was well\naware for what purpose he came, and stretched out her naked throat, and\nthat very cheerfully to him, bewailing her case, like one that utterly\ndespaired of her life, and bidding him not to boggle at finishing the tragedy\nthey had resolved upon relating to her.

At\nthe first he got himself such friends as were in all respects the most\nworthy, and was greatly beloved by them, while he imitated their zealous\napplication to the learning and to the glorious actions of the best men;\nbut when he became insolent towards them, they laid aside the kindness\nthey had for him, and began to hate him; from which hatred came that plot\nwhich they raised against him, and wherein he perished."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "The first place Claudius came to was inhabited, and called Herincure, as\nSpanheim here informs us from Suetonius, in Claud. ch. 10."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "How Claudius, another son of Drusus, which Drusus was the father of Germanicus,\ncould be here himself called Germanicus, Suetonius informs us, when he\nassures us that, by a decree of the senate, the surname of Germanicus was\nbestowed upon Drusus, and his posterity also.--In Claud. ch. 1."}], "emph": "pretorian", "#text": "NOW Claudius, as I said before, went out of that way along which\nCaius was gone; and as the family was in a mighty disorder upon the sad\naccident of the murder of Caius, he was in great distress how to save himself,\nand was found to have hidden himself in a certain narrow place, \nthough he had no other occasion for suspicion of any dangers, besides the\ndignity of his birth; for while he was a private man, he behaved himself\nwith moderation, and was contented with his present fortune, applying himself\nto learning, and especially to that of the Greeks, and keeping himself\nentirely clear from every thing that might bring on any disturbance. But\nas at this time the multitude were under a consternation, and the whole\npalace was full of the soldiers' madness, and the very emperor's guards\nseemed under the like fear and disorder with private persons, the band\ncalled , which was the purest part of the army, was in\nconsultation what was to be done at this juncture. Now all those that were\nat this consultation had little regard to the punishment Caius had suffered,\nbecause he justly deserved such his fortune; but they were rather considering\ntheir own circumstances, how they might take the best care of themselves,\nespecially while the Germans were busy in punishing the murderers of Caius;\nwhich yet was rather done to gratify their own savage temper, than for\nthe good of the public; all which things disturbed Claudius, who was afraid\nof his own safety, and this particularly because he saw the heads of Asprenas\nand his partners carried about. His station had been on a certain elevated\nplace, whither a few steps led him, and whither he had retired in the dark\nby himself. But when Gratus, who was one of the soldiers that belonged\nto the palace, saw him, but did not well know by his countenance who he\nwas, because it was dark, though he could well judge that it was a man\nwho was privately there on some design, he came nearer to him; and when\nClaudius desired that he would retire, be discovered who he was, and owned\nhim to be Claudius. So he said to his followers, \"This is a Germanicus;\n\ncome on, let us choose him for our emperor.\" But when Claudius saw\nthey were making preparations for taking him away by force, and was afraid\nthey would kill him, as they had killed Caius, he besought them to spare\nhim, putting them in mind how quietly he had demeaned himself, and that\nhe was unacquainted with what had been done. Hereupon Gratus smiled upon\nhim, and took him by the right hand, and said, \"Leave off, sir, these\nlow thoughts of saving yourself, while you ought to have greater thoughts,\neven of obtaining the empire, which the gods, out of their concern for\nthe habitable world, by taking Caius out of the way, commit to thy virtuous\nconduct. Go to, therefore, and accept of the throne of thy ancestors.\"\nSo they took him up and carried him, because he was not then able to go\non foot, such was his dread and his joy at what was told him."}, "Now there was already gathered together about Gratus a great number\nof the guards; and when they saw Claudius carried off, they looked with\na sad countenance, as supposing that he was carried to execution for the\nmischiefs that had been lately done; while yet they thought him a man who\nnever meddled with public affairs all his life long, and one that had met\nwith no contemptible dangers under the reign of Caius; and some of them\nthought it reasonable that the consuls should take cognizance of these\nmatters; and as still more and more of the soldiery got together, the crowd\nabout him ran away, and Claudius could hardly go on, his body was then\nso weak; and those who carried his sedan, upon an inquiry that was made\nabout his being carried off, ran away and saved themselves, as despairing\nof their Lord's preservation. But when they were come into the large court\nof the palace, (which, as the report goes about it, was inhabited first\nof all the parts of the city of Rome,) and had just reached the public\ntreasury, many more soldiers came about him, as glad to see Claudius's\nface, and thought it exceeding right to make him emperor, on account of\ntheir kindness for Germanicus, who was his brother, and had left behind\nhim a vast reputation among all that were acquainted with him. They reflected\nalso on the covetous temper of the leading men of the senate, and what\ngreat errors they had been guilty of when the senate had the government\nformerly; they also considered the impossibility of such an undertaking,\nas also what dangers they should be in, if the government should come to\na single person, and that such a one should possess it as they had no hand\nin advancing, and not to Claudius, who would take it as their grant, and\nas gained by their good-will to him, and would remember the favors they\nhad done him, and would make them a sufficient recompense for the same.", "These were the discourses the soldiers had one with another by themselves,\nand they communicated them to all such as came in to them. Now those that\ninquired about this matter willingly embraced the invitation that was made\nthem to join with the rest; so they carried Claudius into the camp, crowding\nabout him as his guard, and encompassing him about, one chairman still\nsucceeding another, that their vehement endeavors might not be hindered.\nBut as to the populace and senators, they disagreed in their opinions.\nThe latter were very desirous to recover their former dignity, and were\nzealous to get clear of the slavery that had been brought on them by the\ninjurious treatment of the tyrants, which the present opportunity afforded\nthem; but for the people, who were envious against them, and knew that\nthe emperors were capable of curbing their covetous temper, and were a\nrefuge from them, they were very glad that Claudius had been seized upon,\nand brought to them, and thought that if Claudius were made emperor, he\nwould prevent a civil war, such as there was in the days of Pompey. But\nwhen the senate knew that Claudius was brought into the camp by the soldiers,\nthey sent to him those of their body which had the best character for their\nvirtues, that they might inform him that he ought to do nothing by violence,\nin order to gain the government; that he who was a single person, one either\nalready or hereafter to be a member of their body, ought to yield to the\nsenate, which consisted of so great a number; that he ought to let the\nlaw take place in the disposal of all that related to the public order,\nand to remember how greatly the former tyrants had afflicted their city,\nand what dangers both he and they had escaped under Caius; and that he\nought not to hate the heavy burden of tyranny, when the injury is done\nby others, while he did himself willfully treat his country after a mad\nand insolent manner; that if he would comply with them, and demonstrate\nthat his firm resolution was to live quietly and virtuously, he would have\nthe greatest honors decreed to him that a free people could bestow; and\nby subjecting himself to the law, would obtain this branch of commendation,\nthat he acted like a man of virtue, both as a ruler and a subject; but\nthat if he would act foolishly, and learn no wisdom by Caius's death, they\nwould not permit him to go on; that a great part of the army was got together\nfor them, with plenty of weapons, and a great number of slaves, which they\ncould make use of; that good hope was a great matter in such cases, as\nwas also good fortune; and that the gods would never assist any others\nbut those that undertook to act with virtue and goodness, who can be no\nother than such as fight for the liberty of their country.", "Now these ambassadors, Veranius and Brocchus, who were both of them\ntribunes of the people, made this speech to Claudius; and falling down\nupon their knees, they begged of him that he would not throw the city into\nwars and misfortunes; but when they saw what a multitude of soldiers encompassed\nand guarded Claudius, and that the forces that were with the consuls were,\nin comparison of them, perfectly inconsiderable, they added, that if he\ndid desire the government, he should accept of it as given by the senate;\nthat he would prosper better, and be happier, if he came to it, not by\nthe injustice, but by the good-will of those that would bestow it upon\nhim.", "NOW Claudius, though he was sensible after what an insolent manner\nthe senate had sent to him yet did he, according to their advice, behave\nhimself for the present with moderation; but not so far that he could not\nrecover himself out of his fright; so he was encouraged [to claim the government]\npartly by the boldness of the soldiers, and partly by the persuasion of\nking Agrippa, who exhorted him not to let such a dominion slip out of his\nhands, when it came thus to him of its own accord. Now this Agrippa, with\nrelation to Caius, did what became one that had been so much honored by\nhim; for he embraced Caius's body after he was dead, and laid it upon a\nbed, and covered it as well as he could, and went out to the guards, and\ntold them that Caius was still alive; but he said that they should call\nfor physicians, since he was very ill of his wounds. But when he had learned\nthat Claudius was carried away violently by the soldiers, he rushed through\nthe crowd to him, and when he found that he was in disorder, and ready\nto resign up the government to the senate, he encouraged him, and desired\nhim to keep the government; but when he had said this to Claudius, he retired\nhome. And upon the senate's sending for him, he anointed his head with\nointment, as if he had lately accompanied with his wife, and had dismissed\nher, and then came to them: he also asked of the senators what Claudius\ndid; who told him the present state of affairs, and then asked his opinion\nabout the settlement of the public. He told them in words that he was ready\nto lose his life for the honor of the senate, but desired them to consider\nwhat was for their advantage, without any regard to what was most agreeable\nto them; for that those who grasp at government will stand in need of weapons\nand soldiers to guard them, unless they will set up without any preparation\nfor it, and so fall into danger. And when the senate replied that they\nwould bring in weapons in abundance, and money, and that as to an army,\na part of it was already collected together for them, and they would raise\na larger one by giving the slaves their liberty, - Agrippa made answer,\n\"O senators! may you be able to compass what you have a mind to; yet\nwill I immediately tell you my thoughts, because they tend to your preservation.\nTake notice, then, that the army which will fight for Claudius hath been\nlong exercised in warlike affairs; but our army will be no better than\na rude multitude of raw men, and those such as have been unexpectedly made\nfree from slavery, and ungovernable; we must then fight against those that\nare skillful in war, with men who know not so much as how to draw their\nswords.

So they fully declared themselves to\nbe for the giving the government not to all, but to one; but they gave\nthe senate leave to look out for a person worthy to be set over them, insomuch\nthat now the affairs of the senate were much worse than before, because\nthey had not only failed in the recovery of their liberty, which they boasted\nthemselves of, but were in dread of Claudius also. Yet were there those\nthat hankered after the government, both on account of the dignity of their\nfamilies and that accruing to them by their marriages; for Marcus Minucianus\nwas illustrious, both by his own nobility, and by his having married Julia,\nthe sister of Caius, who accordingly was very ready to claim the government,\nalthough the consuls discouraged him, and made one delay after another\nin proposing it: that Minucianus also, who was one of Caius's murderers,\nrestrained Valerius of Asia from thinking of such things; and a prodigious\nslaughter there had been, if leave had been given to these men to set up\nfor themselves, and oppose Claudius. There were also a considerable number\nof gladiators besides, and of those soldiers who kept watch by night in\nthe city, and rowers of ships, who all ran into the camp; insomuch that,\nof those who put in for the government, some left off their pretensions\nin order to spare the city, and others out of fear for their own persons.", "But as soon as ever it was day, Cherea, and those that were with\nhim, came into the senate, and attempted to make speeches to the soldiers.\nHowever, the multitude of those soldiers, when they saw that they were\nmaking signals for silence with their hands, and were ready to begin to\nspeak to them, grew tumultuous, and would not let them speak at all, because\nthey were all zealous to be under a monarchy; and they demanded of the\nsenate one for their ruler, as not enduring any longer delays: but the\nsenate hesitated about either their own governing, or how they should themselves\nbe governed, while the soldiers would not admit them to govern, and the\nmurderers of Caius would not permit the soldiers to dictate to them. When\nthey were in these circumstances, Cherea was not able to contain the anger\nhe had, and promised, that if they desired an emperor, he would give them\none, if any one would bring him the watchword from Eutychus. Now this Eutychus\nwas charioteer of the green-band faction, styled Prasine, and a great friend\nof Caius, who used to harass the soldiery with building stables for the\nhorses, and spent his time in ignominious labors, which occasioned Cherea\nto reproach them with him, and to abuse them with much other scurrilous\nlanguage; and told them he would bring them the head of Claudius; and that\nit was an amazing thing, that, after their former madness, they should\ncommit their government to a fool. Yet were not they moved with his words,\nbut drew their swords, and took up their ensigns, and went to Claudius,\nto join in taking the oath of fidelity to him. So the senate were left\nwithout any body to defend them, and the very consuls differed nothing\nfrom private persons.

And for the golden chain which had been given him by Caius,\nof equal weight with that iron chain wherewith his royal hands had been\nbound, he hung it up within the limits of the temple, over the treasury,\n\nthat it might be a memorial of the severe fate he had lain under, and a\ntestimony of his change for the better; that it might be a demonstration\nhow the greatest prosperity may have a fall, and that God sometimes raises\nup what is fallen down: for this chain thus dedicated afforded a document\nto all men, that king Agrippa had been once bound in a chain for a small\ncause, but recovered his former dignity again; and a little while afterward\ngot out of his bonds, and was advanced to be a more illustrious king than\nhe was before. Whence men may understand that all that partake of human\nnature, how great soever they are, may fall; and that those that fall may\ngain their former illustrious dignity again."}, "And when Agrippa had entirely finished all the duties of the Divine\nworship, he removed Theophilus, the son of Ananus, from the high priesthood,\nand bestowed that honor of his on Simon the son of Boethus, whose name\nwas also Cantheras whose daughter king Herod married, as I have related\nabove. Simon, therefore, had the [high] priesthood with his brethren, and\nwith his father, in like manner as the sons of Simon, the son of Onias,\nwho were three, had it formerly under the government of the Macedonians,\nas we have related in a former book.", "When the king had settled the high priesthood after this manner,\nhe returned the kindness which the inhabitants of Jerusalem had showed\nhim; for he released them from the tax upon houses, every one of which\npaid it before, thinking it a good thing to requite the tender affection\nof those that loved him. He also made Silas the general of his forces,\nas a man who had partaken with him in many of his troubles. But after a\nvery little while the young men of Doris, preferring a rash attempt before\npiety, and being naturally bold and insolent, carried a statue of Caesar\ninto a synagogue of the Jews, and erected it there. This procedure of theirs\ngreatly provoked Agrippa; for it plainly tended to the dissolution of the\nlaws of his country. So he came without delay to Publius Petronius, who\nwas then president of Syria, and accused the people of Doris. Nor did he\nless resent what was done than did Agrippa; for he judged it a piece of\nimpiety to transgress the laws that regulate the actions of men. So he\nwrote the following letter to the people of Doris in an angry strain: \"Publius\nPetronius, the president under Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus,\nto the magistrates of Doris, ordains as follows: Since some of you have\nhad the boldness, or madness rather, after the edict of Claudius Caesar\nAugustus Germanicus was published, for permitting the Jews to observe the\nlaws of their country, not to obey the same, but have acted in entire opposition\nthereto, as forbidding the Jews to assemble together in the synagogue,\nby removing Caesar's statue, and setting it up therein, and thereby have\noffended not only the Jews, but the emperor himself, whose statue is more\ncommodiously placed in his own temple than in a foreign one, where is the\nplace of assembling together; while it is but a part of natural justice,\nthat every one should have the power over the place belonging peculiarly\nto themselves, according to the determination of Caesar, - to say nothing\nof my own determination, which it would be ridiculous to mention after\nthe emperor's edict, which gives the Jews leave to make use of their own\ncustoms, as also gives order that they enjoy equally the rights of citizens\nwith the Greeks themselves, - I therefore ordain that Proculus Vitellius,\nthe centurion, bring those men to me, who, contrary to Augustus's edict,\nhave been so insolent as to do this thing, at which those very men, who\nappear to be of principal reputation among them, have an indignation also,\nand allege for themselves, 'that it was not done with their consent, but\nby the violence of the multitude, that they may give an account of what\nhath been done. I also exhort the principal magistrates among them, unless\nthey have a mind to have this action esteemed to be done with their consent,\nto inform the centurion of those that were guilty of it, and take care\nthat no handle be hence taken for raising a sedition or quarrel among them;\nwhich those seem to me to treat after who encourage such doings; while\nboth I myself, and king Agrippa, for whom I have the highest honor, have\nnothing more under our care, than that the nation of the Jews may have\nno occasion given them of getting together, under the pretense of avenging\nthemselves, and become tumultuous. And that it may be more publicly known\nwhat Augustus hath resolved about this whole matter, I have subjoined those\nedicts which he hath lately caused to be published at Alexandria, and which,\nalthough they may be well known to all, yet did king Agrippa, for whom\nI have the highest honor, read them at that time before my tribunal, and\npleaded that the Jews ought not to be deprived of those rights which Augustus\nhath granted them. I therefore charge you, that you do not, for the time\nto come, seek for any occasion of sedition or disturbance, but that every\none be allowed to follow their own religious customs.\"", "Thus did Petronius take care of this matter, that such a breach of\nthe law might be corrected, and that no such thing might be attempted afterwards\nagainst the Jews. And now king Agrippa took the [high] priesthood away\nfrom Simon Cantheras, and put Jonathan, the son of Ananus, into it again,\nand owned that he was more worthy of that dignity than the other. But this\nwas not a thing acceptable to him, to recover that his former dignity.\nSo he refused it, and said, \"O king! I rejoice in the honor that thou\nhast for me, and take it kindly that thou wouldst give me such a dignity\nof thy own inclinations, although God hath judged that I am not at all\nworthy of the high priesthood. I am satisfied with having once put on the\nsacred garments; for I then put them on after a more holy manner than I\nshould now receive them again. But if thou desirest that a person more\nworthy than myself should have this honorable employment, give me leave\nto name thee such a one. I have a brother that is pure from all sin against\nGod, and of all offenses against thyself; I recommend him to thee, as one\nthat is fit for this dignity.\" So the king was pleased with these\nwords of his, and passed by Jonathan, and, according to his brother's desire,\nbestowed the high priesthood upon Matthias. Nor was it long before Marcus\nsucceeded Petronius, as president of Syria.", "NOW Silas, the general of the king's horse, because he had been faithful\nto him under all his misfortunes, and had never refused to be a partaker\nwith him in any of his dangers, but had oftentimes undergone the most hazardous\ndangers for him, was full of assurance, and thought he might expect a sort\nof equality with the king, on account of the firmness of the friendship\nhe had showed to him. Accordingly, he would no where let the king sit as\nhis superior, and took the like liberty in speaking to him upon all occasions,\ntill he became troublesome to the king, when they were merry together,\nextolling himself beyond measure, and oft putting the king in mind of the\nseverity of fortune he had undergone, that he might, by way of ostentation,\ndemonstrate What zeal he had showed in his service; and was continually\nharping upon this string, what pains he had taken for him, and much enlarged\nstill upon that subject. The repetition of this so frequently seemed to\nreproach the king, insomuch that he took this ungovernable liberty of talking\nvery ill at his hands. For the commemoration of times when men have been\nunder ignominy, is by no means agreeable to them; and he is a very silly\nman who is perpetually relating to a person what kindness he had done him.\nAt last, therefore, Silas had so thoroughly provoked the king's indignation,\nthat he acted rather out of passion than good consideration, and did not\nonly turn Silas out of his place, as general of his horse, but sent him\nin bonds into his own country. But the edge of his anger wore off by length\nof time, and made room for more just reasonings as to his judgment about\nthis man; and he considered how many labors he had undergone for his sake.\nSo when Agrippa was solemnizing his birth-day, and he gave festival entertainments\nto all his subjects, he sent for Silas on the sudden to be his guest. But\nas he was a very frank man, he thought he had now a just handle given him\nto be angry; which he could not conceal from those that came for him, but\nsaid to them, \"What honor is this the king invites me to, which I\nconclude will soon be over? For the king hath not let me keep those original\nmarks of the good-will I bore him, which I once had from him; but he hath\nplundered me, and that unjustly also. Does he think that I can leave off\nthat liberty of speech, which, upon the consciousness of my deserts, I\nshall use more loudly than before, and shall relate how many misfortunes\nI have been delivered from; how many labors I have undergone for him, whereby\nI procured him deliverance and respect; as a reward for which I have borne\nthe hardships of bonds and a dark prison? I shall never forget this usage.\nNay, perhaps, my very soul, when it is departed out of the body, will not\nforget the glorious actions I did on his account.\" This was the clamor\nhe made, and he ordered the messengers to tell it to the king. So he perceived\nthat Silas was incurable in his folly, and still suffered him to lie in\nprison.", "As for the walls of Jerusalem, that were adjoining to the new city\n[Bezetha], he repaired them at the expense of the public, and built them\nwider in breadth, and higher in altitude; and he had made them too strong\nfor all human power to demolish, unless Marcus, the then president of Syria,\nhad by letter informed Claudius Caesar of what he was doing. And when Claudius\nhad some suspicion of attempts for innovation, he sent to Agrippa to leave\noff the building of those walls presently. So he obeyed, as not thinking\nit proper to contradict Claudius.", "Now this king was by nature very beneficent and liberal in his gifts,\nand very ambitious to oblige people with such large donations; and he made\nhimself very illustrious by the many chargeable presents he made them.\nHe took delight in giving, and rejoiced in living with good reputation.\nHe was not at all like that Herod who reigned before him; for that Herod\nwas ill-natured, and severe in his punishments, and had no mercy on them\nthat he hated; and every one perceived that he was more friendly to the\nGreeks than to the Jews; for he adorned foreign cities with large presents\nin money; with building them baths and theatres besides; nay, in some of\nthose places he erected temples, and porticoes in others; but he did not\nvouchsafe to raise one of the least edifices in any Jewish city, or make\nthem any donation that was worth mentioning. But Agrippa's temper was mild,\nand equally liberal to all men. He was humane to foreigners, and made them\nsensible of his liberality. He was in like manner rather of a gentle and\ncompassionate temper. Accordingly, he loved to live continually at Jerusalem,\nand was exactly careful in the observance of the laws of his country. He\ntherefore kept himself entirely pure; nor did any day pass over his head\nwithout its appointed sacrifice.", "However, there was a certain mall of the Jewish nation at Jerusalem,\nwho appeared to be very accurate in the knowledge of the law. His name\nwas Simon. This man got together an assembly, while the king was absent\nat Cesarea, and had the insolence to accuse him as not living holily, and\nthat he might justly be excluded out of the temple, since it belonged only\nto native Jews. But the general of Agrippa's army informed him that Simon\nhad made such a speech to the people. So the king sent for him; and as\nhe was sitting in the theater, he bid him sit down by him, and said to\nhim with a low and gentle voice, \"What is there done in this place\nthat is contrary to the law?\" But he had nothing to say for himself,\nbut begged his pardon. So the king was more easily reconciled to him than\none could have imagined, as esteeming mildness a better quality in a king\nthan anger, and knowing that moderation is more becoming in great men than\npassion. So he made Simon a small present, and dismissed him.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "A strange number of condemned criminals to be under the sentence of death\nat once; no fewer, it seems, than one thousand four hundred!"}, "#text": "Now as Agrippa was a great builder in many places, he paid a peculiar\nregard to the people of Berytus; for he erected a theater for them, superior\nto many others of that sort, both in Sumptuousness and elegance, as also\nan amphitheater, built at vast expenses; and besides these, he built them\nbaths and porticoes, and spared for no costs in any of his edifices, to\nrender them both handsome and large. He also spent a great deal upon their\ndedication, and exhibited shows upon them, and brought thither musicians\nof all sorts, and such as made the most delightful music of the greatest\nvariety. He also showed his magnificence upon the theater, in his great\nnumber of gladiators; and there it was that he exhibited the several antagonists,\nin order to please the spectators; no fewer indeed than seven hundred men\nto fight with seven hundred other men \nand allotted all the malefactors he had for this exercise, that both the\nmalefactors might receive their punishment, and that this operation of\nwar might be a recreation in peace. And thus were these criminals all destroyed\nat once."}, "WHEN Agrippa had finished what I have above related at Berytus, he\nremoved to Tiberias, a city of Galilee. Now he was in great esteem among\nother kings. Accordingly there came to him Antiochus, king of Commalena,\nSampsigeratnus, king of Emesa, and Cotys, who was king of the Lesser Armenia,\nand Polemo, who was king of Pontus, as also Herod his brother, who was\nking of Chalcis. All these he treated with agreeable entertainments, and\nafter an obliging manner, and so as to exhibit the greatness of his mind,\nand so as to appear worthy of those respects which the kings paid to him,\nby coming thus to see him. However, while these kings staid with him, Marcus,\nthe president of Syria, came thither. So the king, in order to preserve\nthe respect that was due to the Romans, went out of the city to meet him,\nas far as seven furlongs. But this proved to be the beginning of a difference\nbetween him and Marcus; for he took with him in his chariot those other\nkings as his assessors. But Marcus had a suspicion what the meaning could\nbe of so great a friendship of these kings one with another, and did not\nthink so close an agreement of so many potentates to be for the interest\nof the Romans. He therefore sent some of his domestics to every one of\nthem, and enjoined them to go their ways home without further delay. This\nwas very ill taken by Agrippa, who after that became his enemy. And now\nhe took the high priesthood away from Matthias, and made Elioneus, the\nson of Cantheras, high priest in his stead.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "We have a mighty cry made here by some critics, as the great Eusebius had\non purpose falsified this account of Josephus, so as to make it agree with\nthe parallel account in the Acts of the Apostles, because the present copies\nof his citation of it, Hist.

At which\nfestival a great multitude was gotten together of the principal persons,\nand such as were of dignity through his province. On the second day of\nwhich shows he put on a garment made wholly of silver, and of a contexture\ntruly wonderful, and came into the theater early in the morning; at which\ntime the silver of his garment being illuminated by the fresh reflection\nof the sun's rays upon it, shone out after a surprising manner, and was\nso resplendent as to spread a horror over those that looked intently upon\nhim; and presently his flatterers cried out, one from one place, and another\nfrom another, (though not for his good,) that he was a god; and they added,\n\"Be thou merciful to us; for although we have hitherto reverenced\nthee only as a man, yet shall we henceforth own thee as superior to mortal\nnature.\" Upon this the king did neither rebuke them, nor reject their\nimpious flattery. But as he presently afterward looked up, he saw an owl\n\nsitting on a certain rope over his head, and immediately understood that\nthis bird was the messenger of ill tidings, as it had once been the messenger\nof good tidings to him; and fell into the deepest sorrow. A severe pain\nalso arose in his belly, and began in a most violent manner. He therefore\nlooked upon his friends, and said, \"I, whom you call a god, am commanded\npresently to depart this life; while Providence thus reproves the lying\nwords you just now said to me; and I, who was by you called immortal, am\nimmediately to be hurried away by death. But I am bound to accept of what\nProvidence allots, as it pleases God; for we have by no means lived ill,\nbut in a splendid and happy manner.\" When he said this, his pain was\nbecome violent.

Now the king rested\nin a high chamber, and as he saw them below lying prostrate on the ground,\nhe could not himself forbear weeping. And when he had been quite worn out\nby the pain in his belly for five days, he departed this life, being in\nthe fifty-fourth year of his age, and in the seventh year of his reign;\nfor he reigned four years under Caius Caesar, three of them were over Philip's\ntetrarchy only, and on the fourth he had that of Herod added to it; and\nhe reigned, besides those, three years under the reign of Claudius Caesar;\nin which time he reigned over the forementioned countries, and also had\nJudea added to them, as well as Samaria and Cesarea. The revenues that\nhe received out of them were very great, no less than twelve millions of\ndrachme. \nYet did he borrow great sums from others; for he was so very liberal that\nhis expenses exceeded his incomes, and his generosity was boundless."}, "But before the multitude were made acquainted with Agrippa's being\nexpired, Herod the king of Chalcis, and Helcias the master of his horse,\nand the king's friend, sent Aristo, one of the king's most faithful servants,\nand slew Silas, who had been their enemy, as if it had been done by the\nking's own command.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Photius, who made an extract out of this section, says they were not the\nstatues or images, but the ladies themselves, who were thus basely abused\nby the soldiers."}, "#text": "AND thus did king Agrippa depart this life.

He was therefore disposed to send Agrippa, junior, away presently\nto succeed his father in the kingdom, and was willing to confirm him in\nit by his oath. But those freed-men and friends of his, who had the greatest\nauthority with him, dissuaded him from it, and said that it was a dangerous\nexperiment to permit so large a kingdom to come under the government of\nso very young a man, and one hardly yet arrived at years of discretion,\nwho would not be able to take sufficient care of its administration; while\nthe weight of a kingdom is heavy enough to a grown man.

But Fadus, as soon as he was come procurator\ninto Judea, found quarrelsome doings between the Jews that dwelt in Perea,\nand the people of Philadelphia, about their borders, at a village called\nMia, that was filled with men of a warlike temper; for the Jews of Perea\nhad taken up arms without the consent of their principal men, and had destroyed\nmany of the Philadelphians. When Fadus was informed of this procedure,\nit provoked him very much that they had not left the determination of the\nmatter to him, if they thought that the Philadelphians had done them any\nwrong, but had rashly taken up arms against them. So he seized upon three\nof their principal men, who were also the causes of this sedition, and\nordered them to be bound, and afterwards had one of them slain, whose name\nwas Hannibal; and he banished the other two, Areram and Eleazar. Tholomy\nalso, the arch robber, was, after some time, brought to him bound, and\nslain, but not till he had done a world of mischief to Idumea and the Arabians.\nAnd indeed, from that time, Judea was cleared of robberies by the care\nand providence of Fadus. He also at this time sent for the high priests\nand the principal citizens of Jerusalem, and this at the command of the\nemperor, and admonished them that they should lay up the long garment and\nthe sacred vestment, which it is customary for nobody but the high priest\nto wear, in the tower of Antonia, that it might be under the power of the\nRomans, as it had been formerly. Now the Jews durst not contradict what\nhe had said, but desired Fadus, however, and Longinus, (which last was\ncome to Jerusalem, and had brought a great army with him, out of a fear\nthat the [rigid] injunctions of Fadus should force the Jews to rebel,)\nthat they might, in the first place, have leave to send ambassadors to\nCaesar, to petition him that they may have the holy vestments under their\nown power; and that, in the next place, they would tarry till they knew\nwhat answer Claudius would give to that their request. So they replied,\nthat they would give them leave to send their ambassadors, provided they\nwould give them their sons as pledges [for their peaceable behavior]. And\nwhen they had agreed so to do, and had given them the pledges they desired,\nthe ambassadors were sent accordingly. But when, upon their coming to Rome,\nAgrippa, junior, the son of the deceased, understood the reason why they\ncame, (for he dwelt with Claudius Caesar, as we said before,) he besought\nCaesar to grant the Jews their request about the holy vestments, and to\nsend a message to Fadus accordingly.", "Hereupon Claudius called for the ambassadors; and told them that\nhe granted their request; and bade them to return their thanks to Agrippa\nfor this favor, which had been bestowed on them upon his entreaty.

But\nthe very day that Monobazus died, queen Helena sent for all the grandees,\nand governors of the kingdom, and for those that had the armies committed\nto their command; and when they were come, she made the following speech\nto them: \"I believe you are not unacquainted that my husband was desirous\nIzates should succeed him in the government, and thought him worthy so\nto do. However, I wait your determination; for happy is he who receives\na kingdom, not from a single person only, but from the willing suffrages\nof a great many.\" This she said, in order to try those that were invited,\nand to discover their sentiments. Upon the hearing of which, they first\nof all paid their homage to the queen, as their custom was, and then they\nsaid that they confirmed the king's determination, and would submit to\nit; and they rejoiced that Izates's father had preferred him before the\nrest of his brethren, as being agreeable to all their wishes: but that\nthey were desirous first of all to slay his brethren and kinsmen, that\nso the government might come securely to Izates; because if they were once\ndestroyed, all that fear would be over which might arise from their hatred\nand envy to him. Helena replied to this, that she returned them her thanks\nfor their kindness to herself and to Izates; but desired that they would\nhowever defer the execution of this slaughter of Izates's brethren till\nhe should be there himself, and give his approbation to it. So since these\nmen had not prevailed with her, when they advised her to slay them, they\nexhorted her at least to keep them in bonds till he should come, and that\nfor their own security; they also gave her counsel to set up some one whom\nshe could put the greatest trust in, as a governor of the kingdom in the\nmean time. So queen Helena complied with this counsel of theirs, and set\nup Monobazus, the eldest son, to be king, and put the diadem upon his head,\nand gave him his father's ring, with its signet; as also the ornament which\nthey call Sampser, and exhorted him to administer the affairs of the kingdom\ntill his brother should come; who came suddenly upon hearing that his father\nwas dead, and succeeded his brother Monobazus, who resigned up the government\nto him."}, "Now, during the time Izates abode at Charax-Spasini, a certain Jewish\nmerchant, whose name was Ananias, got among the women that belonged to\nthe king, and taught them to worship God according to the Jewish religion.\nHe, moreover, by their means, became known to Izates, and persuaded him,\nin like manner, to embrace that religion; he also, at the earnest entreaty\nof Izates, accompanied him when he was sent for by his father to come to\nAdiabene; it also happened that Helena, about the same time, was instructed\nby a certain other Jew and went over to them. But when Izates had taken\nthe kingdom, and was come to Adiabene, and there saw his brethren and other\nkinsmen in bonds, he was displeased at it; and as he thought it an instance\nof impiety either to slay or imprison them, but still thought it a hazardous\nthing for to let them have their liberty, with the remembrance of the injuries\nthat had been offered them, he sent some of them and their children for\nhostages to Rome, to Claudius Caesar, and sent the others to Artabanus,\nthe king of Parthia, with the like intentions.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Josephus is very full and express in these three chapters, 3., 4., and\n5., in observing how carefully Divine Providence preserved this Izates,\nking of Adiabene, and his sons, while he did what he thought was his bounden\nduty, notwithstanding the strongest political motives to the contrary."}, "#text": "And when he perceived that his mother was highly pleased with the\nJewish customs, he made haste to change, and to embrace them entirely;\nand as he supposed that he could not he thoroughly a Jew unless he were\ncircumcised, he was ready to have it done.

This it was that she said to him, and for the present persuaded\nhim to forbear. And when he had related what she had said to Ananias, he\nconfirmed what his mother had said; and when he had also threatened to\nleave him, unless he complied with him, he went away from him, and said\nthat he was afraid lest such an action being once become public to all,\nhe should himself be in danger of punishment for having been the occasion\nof it, and having been the king's instructor in actions that were of ill\nreputation; and he said that he might worship God without being circumcised,\neven though he did resolve to follow the Jewish law entirely, which worship\nof God was of a superior nature to circumcision. He added, that God would\nforgive him, though he did not perform the operation, while it was omitted\nout of necessity, and for fear of his subjects. So the king at that time\ncomplied with these persuasions of Ananias. But afterwards, as he had not\nquite left off his desire of doing this thing, a certain other Jew that\ncame out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar, and who was esteemed very\nskillful in the learning of his country, persuaded him to do the thing;\nfor as he entered into his palace to salute him, and found him reading\nthe law of Moses, he said to him, \"Thou dost not consider, O king!\nthat thou unjustly breakest the principal of those laws, and art injurious\nto God himself, [by omitting to be circumcised]; for thou oughtest not\nonly to read them, but chiefly to practice what they enjoin thee. How long\nwilt thou continue uncircumcised? But if thou hast not yet read the law\nabout circumcision, and dost not know how great impiety thou art guilty\nof by neglecting it, read it now.\" When the king had heard what he\nsaid, he delayed the thing no longer, but retired to another room, and\nsent for a surgeon, and did what he was commanded to do. He then sent for\nhis mother, and Ananias his tutor, and informed them that he had done the\nthing; upon which they were presently struck with astonishment and fear,\nand that to a great degree, lest the thing should be openly discovered\nand censured, and the king should hazard the loss of his kingdom, while\nhis subjects would not bear to be governed by a man who was so zealous\nin another religion; and lest they should themselves run some hazard, because\nthey would be supposed the occasion of his so doing. But it was God himself\nwho hindered what they feared from taking effect; for he preserved both\nIzates himself and his sons when they fell into many dangers, and procured\ntheir deliverance when it seemed to be impossible, and demonstrated thereby\nthat the fruit of piety does not perish as to those that have regard to\nhim, and fix their faith upon him only. \nBut these events we shall relate hereafter."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "This further account of the benefactions of Izates and Helena to the Jerusalem\nJews which Josephus here promises is, I think, no where performed by him\nin his present works.

Now her coming was of\nvery great advantage to the people of Jerusalem; for whereas a famine did\noppress them at that time, and many people died for want of what was necessary\nto procure food withal, queen Helena sent some of her servants to Alexandria\nwith money to buy a great quantity of corn, and others of them to Cyprus,\nto bring a cargo of dried figs. And as soon as they were come back, and\nhad brought those provisions, which was done very quickly, she distributed\nfood to those that were in want of it, and left a most excellent memorial\nbehind her of this benefaction, which she bestowed on our whole nation.\nAnd when her son Izates was informed of this famine, \nhe sent great sums of money to the principal men in Jerusalem. However,\nwhat favors this queen and king conferred upon our city Jerusalem shall\nbe further related hereafter."}, "BUT now Artabanus, king of the Parthians perceiving that the governors\nof the provinces had framed a plot against him, did not think it safe for\nhim to continue among them; but resolved to go to Izates, in hopes of finding\nsome way for his preservation by his means, and, if possible, for his return\nto his own dominions. So he came to Izates, and brought a thousand of his\nkindred and servants with him, and met him upon the road, while he well\nknew Izates, but Izates did not know him. When Artabanus stood near him,\nand, in the first place, worshipped him, according to the custom, he then\nsaid to him, \"O king! do not thou overlook me thy servant, nor do\nthou proudly reject the suit I make thee; for as I am reduced to a low\nestate, by the change of fortune, and of a king am become a private man,\nI stand in need of thy assistance.

Now as soon as Izates heard Artabanus's name, and saw him\nstand as a supplicant before him, he leaped down from his horse immediately,\nand said to him, \"Take courage, O king! nor be disturbed at thy present\ncalamity, as if it were incurable; for the change of thy sad condition\nshall be sudden; for thou shalt find me to be more thy friend and thy assistant\nthan thy hopes can promise thee; for I will either re-establish thee in\nthe kingdom of Parthia, or lose my own.\"", "When he had said this, he set Artabanus upon his horse, and followed\nhim on foot, in honor of a king whom he owned as greater than himself;\nwhich, when Artabanus saw, he was very uneasy at it, and sware by his present\nfortune and honor that he would get down from his horse, unless Izates\nwould get upon his horse again, and go before him. So he complied with\nhis desire, and leaped upon his horse; and when he had brought him to his\nroyal palace, he showed him all sorts of respect when they sat together,\nand he gave him the upper place at festivals also, as regarding not his\npresent fortune, but his former dignity, and that upon this consideration\nalso, that the changes of fortune are common to all men.

He also pursued their king, and drove\nhim into a fortress called Arsamus, and following on the siege vigorously,\nhe took that fortress.

When the king of Parthia heard this, he\nboldly made war upon Izates; and as he had no just pretense for this war,\nhe sent to him, and demanded back those honorable privileges which had\nbeen bestowed on him by his father, and threatened, on his refusal, to\nmake war upon him. Upon hearing of this, Izates was under no small trouble\nof mind, as thinking it would be a reproach upon him to appear to resign\nthose privileges that had been bestowed upon him out of cowardice; yet\nbecause he knew, that though the king of Parthia should receive back those\nhonors, yet would he not be quiet, he resolved to commit himself to God,\nhis Protector, in the present danger he was in of his life; and as he esteemed\nhim to be his principal assistant, he intrusted his children and his wives\nto a very strong fortress, and laid up his corn in his citadels, and set\nthe hay and the grass on fire.

When the messenger had delivered this his message, Izates replied\nthat he knew the king of Parthia's power was much greater than his own;\nbut that he knew also that God was much more powerful than all men. And\nwhen he had returned him this answer, he betook himself to make supplication\nto God, and threw himself upon the ground, and put ashes upon his head,\nin testimony of his confusion, and fasted, together with his wives and\nchildren. \nThen he called upon God, and said, \"O Lord and Governor, if I have\nnot in vain committed myself to thy goodness, but have justly determined\nthat thou only art the Lord and principal of all beings, come now to my\nassistance, and defend me from my enemies, not only on my own account,\nbut on account of their insolent behavior with regard to thy power, while\nthey have not feared to lift up their proud and arrogant tongue against\nthee.\" Thus did he lament and bemoan himself, with tears in his eyes;\nwhereupon God heard his prayer.

When Cumanus heard of this action\nof theirs, he took the band of Sebaste, with four regiments of footmen,\nand armed the Samaritans, and marched out against the Jews, and caught\nthem, and slew many of them, and took a great number of them alive; whereupon\nthose that were the most eminent persons at Jerusalem, and that both in\nregard to the respect that was paid them, and the families they were of,\nas soon as they saw to what a height things were gone, put on sackcloth,\nand heaped ashes upon their heads, and by all possible means besought the\nseditious, and persuaded them that they would set before their eyes the\nutter subversion of their country, the conflagration of their temple, and\nthe slavery of themselves, their wives, and children, \nwhich would be the consequences of what they were doing; and would alter\ntheir minds, would cast away their weapons, and for the future be quiet,\nand return to their own homes.

And this seems\nto me to have been the reason why God, out of his hatred of these men's\nwickedness, rejected our city; and as for the temple, he no longer esteemed\nit sufficiently pure for him to inhabit therein, but brought the Romans\nupon us, and threw a fire upon the city to purge it; and brought upon us,\nour wives, and children, slavery, as desirous to make us wiser by our calamities."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "Of these Jewish impostors and false prophets, with many other circumstances\nand miseries of the Jews, till their utter destruction, foretold by our\nSavior, see Lit.

After\nthose thirteen high priests, eighteen took the high priesthood at Jerusalem,\none m succession to another, from the days of king Solomon, until Nebuchadnezzar,\nking of Babylon, made an expedition against that city, and burnt the temple,\nand removed our nation into Babylon, and then took Josadek, the high priest,\ncaptive; the times of these high priests were four hundred and sixty-six\nyears, six months, and ten days, while the Jews were still under the regal\ngovernment. But after the term of seventy years' captivity under the Babylonians,\nCyrus, king of Persia, sent the Jews from Babylon to their own land again,\nand gave them leave to rebuild their temple; at which time Jesus, the son\nof Josadek, took the high priesthood over the captives when they were returned\nhome.

This\nHyrcanus enjoyed that dignity thirty years, and died an old man, leaving\nthe succession to Judas, who was also called Aristobulus, whose brother\nAlexander was his heir; which Judas died of a sore distemper, after he\nhad kept the priesthood, together with the royal authority; for this Judas\nwas the first that put on his head a diadem for one year. And when Alexander\nhad been both king and high priest twenty-seven years, he departed this\nlife, and permitted his wife Alexandra to appoint him that should he high\npriest; so she gave the high priesthood to Hyrcanus, but retained the kingdom\nherself nine years, and then departed this life. The like duration [and\nno longer] did her son Hyrcanus enjoy the high priesthood; for after her\ndeath his brother Aristobulus fought against him, and beat him, and deprived\nhim of his principality; and he did himself both reign, and perform the\noffice of high priest to God. But when he had reigned three years, and\nas many months, Pompey came upon him, and not only took the city of Jerusalem\nby force, but put him and his children in bonds, and sent them to Rome.\nHe also restored the high priesthood to Hyrcanus, and made him governor\nof the nation, but forbade him to wear a diadem. This Hyrcanus ruled, besides\nhis first nine years, twenty-four years more, when Barzapharnes and Pacorus,\nthe generals of the Parthians, passed over Euphrates, and fought with Hyrcanus,\nand took him alive, and made Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus, king; and\nwhen he had reigned three years and three months, Sosius and Herod besieged\nhim, and took him, when Antony had him brought to Antioch, and slain there.\nHerod was then made king by the Romans, but did no longer appoint high\npriests out of the family of Asamoneus; but made certain men to be so that\nwere of no eminent families, but barely of those that were priests, excepting\nthat he gave that dignity to Aristobulus; for when he had made this Aristobulus,\nthe grandson of that Hyrcanus who was then taken by the Parthians, and\nhad taken his sister Mariarmne to wife, he thereby aimed to win the good-will\nof the people, who had a kind remembrance of Hyrcanus [his grandfather].\nYet did he afterward, out of his fear lest they should all bend their inclinations\nto Aristobulus, put him to death, and that by contriving how to have him\nsuffocated as he was swimming at Jericho, as we have already related that\nmatter; but after this man he never intrusted the priesthood to the posterity\nof the sons of Asamoneus. Archelaus also, Herod's son, did like his father\nin the appointment of the high priests, as did the Romans also, who took\nthe government over the Jews into their hands afterward. Accordingly, the\nnumber of the high priests, from the days of Herod until the day when Titus\ntook the temple and the City, and burnt them, were in all twenty-eight;\nthe time also that belonged to them was a hundred and seven years. Some\nof these were the political governors of the people under the reign of\nHerod, and under the reign of Archelaus his son, although, after their\ndeath, the government became an aristocracy, and the high priests were\nintrusted with a dominion over the nation. And thus much may suffice to\nbe said concerning our high priests."}, "NOW Gessius Florus, who was sent as successor to Albinus by Nero,\nfilled Judea with abundance of miseries. He was by birth of the city of\nClazomene, and brought along with him his wife Cleopatra, (by whose friendship\nwith Poppea, Nero's wife, he obtained this government,) who was no way\ndifferent from him in wickedness. This Florus was so wicked, and so violent\nin the use of his authority, that the Jews took Albinus to have been [comparatively]\ntheir benefactor; so excessive were the mischiefs that he brought upon\nthem. For Albinus concealed his wickedness, and was careful that it might\nnot be discovered to all men; but Gessius Florus, as though he bad been\nsent on purpose to show his crimes to every body, made a pompous ostentation\nof them to our nation, as never omitting any sort of violence, nor any\nunjust sort of punishment; for he was not to be moved by pity, and never\nwas satisfied with any degree of gain that came in his way; nor had he\nany more regard to great than to small acquisitions, but became a partner\nwith the robbers themselves. For a great many fell then into that practice\nwithout fear, as having him for their security, and depending on him, that\nhe would save them harmless in their particular robberies; so that there\nwere no bounds set to the nation's miseries; but the unhappy Jews, when\nthey were not able to bear the devastations which the robbers made among\nthem, were all under a necessity of leaving their own habitations, and\nof flying away, as hoping to dwell more easily any where else in the world\namong foreigners [than in their own country]. And what need I say any more\nupon this head? since it was this Florus who necessitated us to take up\narms against the Romans, while we thought it better to be destroyed at\nonce, than by little and little. Now this war began in the second year\nof the government of Florus, and the twelfth year of the reign of Nero.\nBut then what actions we were forced to do, or what miseries we were enabled\nto suffer, may be accurately known by such as will peruse those books which\nI have written about the Jewish war.", "I shall now, therefore, make an end here of my Antiquities; after\nthe conclusion of which events, I began to write that account of the war;\nand these Antiquities contain what hath been delivered down to us from\nthe original creation of man, until the twelfth year of the reign of Nero,\nas to what hath befallen the Jews, as well in Egypt as in Syria and in\nPalestine, and what we have suffered from the Assyrians and Babylonians,\nand what afflictions the Persians and Macedonians, and after them the Romans,\nhave brought upon us; for I think I may say that I have composed this history\nwith sufficient accuracy in all things. I have attempted to enumerate those\nhigh priests that we have had during the interval of two thousand years;\nI have also carried down the succession of our kings, and related their\nactions, and political administration, without [considerable] errors, as\nalso the power of our monarchs; and all according to what is written in\nour sacred books; for this it was that I promised to do in the beginning\nof this history. And I am so bold as to say, now I have so completely perfected\nthe work I proposed to myself to do, that no other person, whether he were\na Jew or foreigner, had he ever so great an inclination to it, could so\naccurately deliver these accounts to the Greeks as is done in these books.\nFor those of my own nation freely acknowledge that I far exceed them in\nthe learning belonging to Jews; I have also taken a great deal of pains\nto obtain the learning of the Greeks, and understand the elements of the\nGreek language, although I have so long accustomed myself to speak our\nown tongue, that I cannot pronounce Greek with sufficient exactness; for\nour nation does not encourage those that learn the languages of many nations,\nand so adorn their discourses with the smoothness of their periods; because\nthey look upon this sort of accomplishment as common, not only to all sorts\nof free-men, but to as many of the servants as please to learn them. But\nthey give him the testimony of being a wise man who is fully acquainted\nwith our laws, and is able to interpret their meaning; on which account,\nas there have been many who have done their endeavors with great patience\nto obtain this learning, there have yet hardly been so many as two or three\nthat have succeeded therein, who were immediately well rewarded for their\npains.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "See the Life at the beginning of the volume."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "ed", "#text": "What Josephus here declares his intention to do, if God permitted, to give\nthe public again an abridgement of the Jewish War hear of it elsewhere,\nwhether he performed what he now intended or not. Some of the reasons of\nthis design of his might possibly be, his observation of the many errors\nhe had been guilty of in the two first of those seven books of the War,\nwhich were written when he was comparatively young, and less acquainted\nwith the Jewish antiquities than he now was, and in which abridgement we\nmight have hoped to find those many passages which himself, as well as\nthose several passages which others refer to, as written by him, but which\nare not extant in his present works. However, since many of his own references\nto what he had written elsewhere, as well as most of his own errors, belong\nto such early times as could not well come into this abridgement of the\nJewish War; and since none of those that quote things not now extant in\nhis works, including himself as well as others, ever cite any such abridgement;\nI am forced rather to suppose that he never did publish any such work at\nall; I mean, as distinct from his own Life, written by himself, for an\nappendix to these Antiquities, and this at least seven years after these\nAntiquities were finished. Nor indeed does it appear to me that Josephus\never published that other work here mentioned, as intended by him for the\npublic also: I mean the three or four books concerning God and his essence,\nand concerning the Jewish laws; why, according to them, some things were\npermitted the Jews, and others prohibited; which last seems to be the same\nwork which Josephus had also promised, if God permitted, at the conclusion\nof his preface to these Antiquities; nor do I suppose that he ever published\nany of them. The death of all his friends at court, Vespasian, Titus, and\nDomitian, and the coming of those he had no acquaintance with to the crown,\nI mean Nerva and Trajan, together with his removal from Rome to Judea,\nwith what followed it, might easily interrupt such his intentions, and\nprevent his publication of those works."}], "#text": "And now it will not be perhaps an invidious thing, if I treat briefly\nof my own family, and of the actions of my own life \nwhile there are still living such as can either prove what I say to be\nfalse, or can attest that it is true; with which accounts I shall put an\nend to these Antiquities, which are contained in twenty books, and sixty\nthousand verses. And if God permit me, I will briefly run over this war\n,\nand to add what befell them further to that very day, the 13th of Domitian,\nor A.D. 03, is not, that I have observed, taken distinct notice of by any\none; nor do we ever again, with what befell us therein to this very day,\nwhich is the thirteenth year of the reign of Caesar Domitian, and the fifty-sixth\nyear of my own life.
