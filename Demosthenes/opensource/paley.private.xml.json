But being unable to sell his wares in Bosporus, he desired the skipper, Lampis, to sail back to Athens without him, promising that he would soon follow. It so happened that Lampis' ship was wrecked; and though Phormion, having no goods on board, was not in any way a loser by the accident, he evaded his liability by falling back on a clause in the contract, which exempted him from payment if his ship failed to come in safe to the Peiraeus.

Chrysippus handles the accounts in a very dexterous way, and convicts Phormion of falsehood by showing that the money he pretended to have paid Lampis was a great deal too much. He dwells also on the improbability of so large a sum having been paid without any witness to the  transaction, and urges that the clause in the contract, making the safety of the ship a condition of the liability, must be taken in close connexion with another clause, which compels the borrower to put goods on board for the home voyage; which Phormion had been unable to do."}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "paragrafh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "eu)qudiki/a"}], "#text": "The , or special plea, might have been put in, says Chrysippus, if the transaction had not been made in, or in connexion with, the Attic mart.

The claim was evidently first made by Mantitheus soon after his father's death. He had recognised his two half-brothers as co-heirs, and was willing to let them take a third share each, though perhaps he was not legally bound to do this. But he asserted his right to the talent over and above his own third part. Upon this Boeotus makes a counter-claim to the same sum, , due to himself from his    mother Plangon ( 14), and, as it seems, to some further property due from his father ( 15). He thought, no doubt, that his brother would decline to risk an action for a still larger demand than that which he had himself made, and which might go against him; and in default of direct evidence, he trusted probably to vague, indirect, and purposely misleading inferences (,  21), to establish the allegation that Plangon had a fortune.

The latter then brings a fresh action against Mantitheus, and Mantitheus renews his old claim against Boeotus, and by that name. There are grounds for believing the man had established his right to the name of Mantitheus: anyhow, when the case went against him as Boeotus, he denied that this was his name and took no notice whatever of the decision ( 17, 18). Consequently, the real Mantitheus is compelled to sue him again in the eleventh year, in the court. Boeotus, it would seem, had changed his claim for Plangon's dower to a demand for some other property, which is not specified; but his motive was the same, to    cancel one demand by another, and he probably made that demand which he thought he could best establish on the slaves' evidence."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italic", "#text": "animus"}, "#text": "That Boeotus had played the bully for a long time, and made many vexatious claims on his brother, is clear from the evidence adduced.

On the other hand, it is shown ( 24, 25) that Mantitheus' mother was a lady of property, the daughter of Polyaratus, and sister of the wife of Chabrias.

The want of that dramatic force which this figure often gives is further emphasized by the fact that we find neither the challenge, the suggestion, nor the rhetorical answer; in short, none of those abrupt and telling checks to the flow of speech by which Demosthenes at once fixes and reposes the attention. The rhetorical value of asyndeton could hardly be better illustrated tban from this drowsy stream of constant polysyndeton... That the writer was a student of Demosthenes is suggested not only by the borrowings from the first speecb against Boeotus, but also by the opening words of the promium, which recall those of Or. 55, but lack their neatness and charm... The touches of insinuation in  8, 23, and the air of moral superiority in  12, 4849, are sufficiently in the tone of the preceding speech to show that the writer wished to preserve to Mantitheus the attitude in which Demosthenes had placed him; but he lacked the ironic power by which the latter made this reserve appear the restraint imposed by a sense of right and decorum on a proud and energetic temperament.  p. 40 f.]"}, {"title": ["Modern Literature.", "Dem. und seine Zeit,", "die Attische Beredsamkeit,", "Quaestiones Demosthcnicae,"], "pb": {"@n": "201"}, "#text": "[ A.

Asyndeton is quite frequent, and apostrophe is freely and effectively used; compare the rapid turning from the adversary to the judge and again to the adversary in  25, the argument rising into emphatic assertion,  268, and into denunciation,  402, the tone of challenge imparted to the argument in  32 and  39, and the vigorous insistence of  38. There are, however, other phenomena which, if the genuineness of the speech had to be decided on stylistic grounds, would tend to cast doubt upon it. The proportion of deictic expressions (2.0) is no higher than in Or. 55  (), and the preponderance of  over  (6 : 2) is not Demosthenic. The lengthy prooemium contains much general reflection in  12, and a long anticipation of the narrative in  34; in this, as in the whole speech, we miss the compact structure and pointed conciseness of the genuine orations. Despite the employment of vivid figures, there is rarely any vivid sharpness and curtness; the livelier forms of question are dulled by length of phrase; and the asyndeton in  45, which might fairly be called cumulative, lacks, by reason of the same lengthiness, all the rapidity and weight that should belong to this figure. On the whole, asyndeton is employed ( 7, 21, 22, 23, 27, 36, 37, 40, 46) rather for deliberate emphasis than in any warm or quick tone, though there is force in the rhetorical answer and in ,  40.
