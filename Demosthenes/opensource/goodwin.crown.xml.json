Boeotia as a whole was nominally allied with Sparta; but Thebes and other towns became disgusted with Sparta's tyrannical conduct soon after the end of the war, and though Thebes had been the greatest enemy of Athens when the peace was made, she harboured Thrasybulus and his fellow exiles before they attacked the Thirty in 403. This disaffection ended in the Boeotian war in 395, in which Athens aided Thebes; in the battle of Haliartus the allies gained a doubtful victory over Sparta, which was made decisive by the death of Lysander on the field.

There can, therefore, be hardly a doubt that the two acts were connected with summoning the Assembly. To do this effectually it was necessary to alarm the whole of Attica immediately; and the natural method for this was to light bonfires on some of the hills near Athens, which would be a signal to distant demes to light fires on their own hills. A fire on Lycabettus could thus give signals directly and indirectly to the whole of Attica, and probably this was understood as a call of the citizens to a special Assembly. As material for lighting signal fires might not always be on hand, it is likely that the dry covering of the booths struck the eyes of the Prytanes as they came out of their office, and that they took them in their haste for this purpose.

But Aeschines says only that the march to Thebes took place . Now that the decree of Demosthenes (181187) is known to be a forgery, we have no reason for thinking that any formal treaty of alliance preceded the invitation of the Athenian army to Thebes. Demosthenes could have proposed such a treaty only after his return to Athens. It appears from the criticisms of Aeschines on the treaty (141144) that it was an elaborate document; and it is probable that it was not made and ratified until some time after the march to Thebes, which required no further legislation than the decree appointing the ambassadors.
