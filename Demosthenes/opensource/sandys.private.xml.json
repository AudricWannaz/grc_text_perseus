His selections included two of the six speeches edited in the\n            present volume, the  and the ; but, as the\n            notes taken down from his lectures were too scanty to form even the basis of any attempt\n            at constructing a complete edition, my commentary on those speeches has been mainly the\n            result of independent reading and research, though I gladly acknowledge the help that is\n            due to his soundness of judgment on several points on which I have consulted him while\n            revising my notes on the  In the case of the\n               when my own commentary was nearly ready for the press, I\n            had the further advantage of attending in the spring of 1874 some of Dr Kennedy's\n            professorial lectures on the Private Orations. From the excellent translation of his\n            brother Mr Charles Rann Kennedy I have here and there quoted a few extracts; and if I\n            have now and then drawn attention to an apparently erroneous interpretation, I have done\n            so with the consciousness that in each case it is only a trifling blemish in what is\n            nearly perfect of its kind. Similarly, several questionable explanations, retained even\n            in the sixth edition of Liddell and Scott's  have been duly\n            pointed out in the course of my commentary, as it is only thus that a labourer in a\n            limited field can offer any acknowledgement of his large indebtedness to their\n              labours. The  lexicography of Demosthenes cannot indeed be said to be at\n            present in a completely satisfactory condition, as general lexicons have still to rely\n            in a great measure on Reiske's  which, with the portion\n            of his  including his notes on the speeches in\n            this volume, was posthumously published exactly a century ago."}, {"title": ["On the Embassy", "On the Crown,"], "pb": {"@n": "vii"}, "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "p": {"title": "Index Demosthenicus", "#text": "Since the above was written the  of S.

This is followed by two on behalf of Phormion's\n            opponent Apollodorus, charging with false witness one of the deponents called on\n            Phormion's side in the previous trial. These three speeches, though not actually\n            delivered in the same lawsuit, virtually represent the arguments of the two opposite\n            sides, and a comparison of their conflicting statements has an interest similar in kind,\n            though different in degree, to that derived from reading the longer and more important\n            orations of Demosthenes,  and \n            in contrast with those of his great rival Aeschines. The orations of Antiphon, the\n            earliest of the Attic Orators, include indeed four sets of ingenious speeches written\n            for the prosecution and the defence in cases of homicide, but his cases are merely\n            imaginary, and the orations are intended as rhetorical exercises alone. The first three\n            selections in this volume supply us with the only instance in all the remains of Attic\n            oratory, where the legal issues raised on both sides in a suit of purely private\n            interest lie before us as they were actually presented to an Athenian tribunal. Whether\n            Demosthenes actually wrote for both sides is a vexed question, briefly discussed in the\n            course of the  Introduction; it is a question that has provoked a large\n            number of dissertations, the titles of which I have recorded on a page devoted to a\n            conspectus of the literature of the subject up to the present date. But the volume now\n            published, while it happens to be the first English commentary on any of the selections\n            included in it, is also the first attempt either in England or elsewhere to put together\n            an edition of all these three speeches in their connexion with one another. As compared with the work demanded by the second half of this volume, where I\n            have been conscious of moving more freely over ground familiarised by more frequent\n            reading of that portion with private pupils between 1867 and 1870, and for public\n            lectures at a later date, the task of writing the first half has proved a somewhat\n            tedious one, owing partly to the necessity of constantly keeping in view all the nine\n            speeches in which Phormion's opponent, Apollodorus, is more or less directly concerned,\n            and of forming an opinion on the numerous points of literary criticism and chronological\n            detail involved in the controversy on the authorship of those orations."}, {"title": "pro Phormione,", "pb": {"@n": "viii"}, "#text": "Those who, after finishing the  do not care to study\n            minutely the whole of the two speeches against Stephanus, ought, at the very least, to\n            examine the vigorous attack on Phormion which extends from  71 to \n            82 of the first of those two speeches. They should also endeavour to obtain a connected\n            view of the argument by reading consecutively the italicised abstracts inserted at\n            suitable intervals in the course of the commentary. With the help of these abstracts the\n            general reader, the barrister, for instance, who has not  remembered all\n            the Greek of his younger days, may perhaps, if tempted to dip into these pages, form\n            some opinion of his own on the forensic oratory of Athens; but my more immediate object\n            in this part of my work has been to obviate any occasion for unduly burdening the notes\n            with those literal renderings which are always welcome to students of the less\n            industrious sort, by supplying instead either a free paraphrase or a condensed summary,\n            as the occasion requires."}, {"title": ["Nicostratus,", "Conon,", "Callicles,"], "#text": "The latter half of the volume includes the  which was\n            delivered by the same speaker as the two orations against Stephanus, namely by\n            Apollodorus, and also the  which is certainly one of the most\n            celebrated of the minor speeches of Demosthenes.

The proper course on the part of Nicostratus, who\n            had made common cause with one of these opponents, would have been to serve Apollodorus\n            with a summons, duly attested by witnesses, requiring him to produce the articles in\n            question. If Apollodorus had, without assigning a legally valid reason, refused to do\n            so, Nicostratus would have been entitled to have a fine levied on Apollodorus and to get\n            him entered as a debtor to the state for the amount of that fine.

To the Greek, says Ruskin,\n            a rose was good for scent, and a stream for sound and coolness; for the rest\n            one was no more than leaves, the other no more than water ( III 4 13  13). A Greek despises\n            flowers, says Mr Bent, unless they are sweet-smelling or useful\n            for something ( p. 276). It is indeed a noteworthy\n            fact, attributable partly to the insignificance of the Attic flora, and still more to\n            the defective development of Greek taste in this particular, that in what is known as\n            the best period of Greek literature there is scarcely a single instance of a refined\n            appreciation of the attractions of a flowergarden. One of the rare exceptions is the\n            mention of  in Ar. Aves 1067. The\n            passage in Eur.
