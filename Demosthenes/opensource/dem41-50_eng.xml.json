And if, men of the\n                    jury, I had not shown all zeal and eagerness in my desire to find a settlement\n                    and to submit the matters at issue to our friends, I should have blamed myself\n                    for not choosing to suffer a trifling loss rather than engage in a troublesome\n                    lawsuit. But, as it is, the more gentleness and\n                    consideration I used in talking with the defendant, the more contempt he showed\n                    toward me. And now it appears that in my contest with him we are in no sense on\n                    equal terms, but he can take the matter lightly, since he has been accustomed to\n                    come often before you, whereas I fear this very thing, that because of my lack\n                    of experience I may prove unable to explain my case to you. None the less, men\n                    of the jury, I beg you to give heed. Polyeuctus was a man of Teithras, not\n                    unknown, it may well be, to some of you. This Polyeuctus, since he had no male\n                    children, adopted Leocrates, the brother of his own wife; but since he had two\n                    daughters by the sister of Leocrates, he gave the elder to me in marriage with a\n                    portion of forty minae, and the younger to Leocrates.\n                    So matters stood, when a quarrel came about\n                    between Polyeuctus and Leocrates, as to the nature of which I know of nothing\n                    which it is incumbent upon me to relate, and Polyeuctus took away his\n                        daughter and gave\n                    her in marriage to this man Spudias. After this Leocrates, being greatly\n                    incensed, brought suit against Polyeuctus and Spudias here, and they were forced\n                    to render an accounting in regard to all the matters at issue, and in the end a\n                    settlement was reached on the terms that Leocrates, on receiving back all that\n                    he had brought into the estate, should be reconciled with Polyeuctus, and that\n                    final releases should be given from all demands made by each upon the other.\n                        Now, why is it, men of the jury, that I\n                    have told you this? Because I did not receive the whole of my wife's portion,\n                    but a thousand drachmae were left unpaid with the understanding that I should\n                    receive them on the death of Polyeuctus; and so long as Leocrates was the heir\n                    of Polyeuctus, it was he who was responsible to me for the debt; but when\n                    Leocrates had left the family, and Polyeuctus was seriously ill, then, men of\n                    the jury, to secure the ten minae, I took a mortgage on this house, the rents\n                    accruing from which Spudias seeks to prevent me from collecting. In the first place, then, I shall bring before you as\n                    witnesses those who were present when Polyeuctus betrothed his daughter to me\n                    with a portion of forty minae; then I shall prove that what I received was less\n                    by a thousand drachmae; and further that Polyeuctus always admitted that he was\n                    in my debt, and that he introduced to me Leocrates as guarantor; and that at his death he directed by his will\n                    that pillars should be set up on the house in my favor for a thousand drachmae\n                    due on account of my wife's portion.Please call\n                    the witnesses.\n                    This, then, men\n                    of the jury, is one of the charges which I make against Spudias. And in this\n                    matter what stronger or more solid ground could I have in coming before you than\n                    the law which expressly ordains that, in all cases where men have given a\n                    mortgage, there shall be no right of action for them or for their heirs? But\n                    nevertheless it is to dispute this just provision that Spudias has come here.\n                        A second claim, men of the jury, is the\n                    following: Aristogenes has deposed that Polyeuctus, when about to die, charged\n                    that there were due him from Spudias two minae with interest this was\n                    the price of a domestic slave whom the defendant had bought from Polyeuctus, but\n                    had neither paid the money nor has now entered it in the general\n                    account; and furthermore there are eighteen hundred drachmae,\n                    regarding which I am myself at a loss to know what reasonable thing he will have\n                    to say. He had borrowed the money from the wife\n                    of Polyeuctus, and there are papers which that lady left behind at her death,\n                    and the lady's brothers are witnesses, for they were present at all times and\n                    questioned her on every point, that there might be no unpleasantness between us.\n                    It is, then, an outrageous and cruel thing, men of the jury, when I on my part,\n                    for everything which I either bought from Polyeuctus during his lifetime or\n                    received from his wife, have duly paid the price and the interest as well, and\n                    am now bringing into the general account everything which I owed, that this fellow should show no regard either for\n                    your laws or for the will of Polyeuctus, or for the papers which have been left,\n                    or for those who knew the facts, but in the face of all this should have come\n                    into court to contest my plea.Please take first\n                    the law which denies the right of action for mortgaged property against the\n                    holders of the mortgage, then the papers which were left, and the deposition of\n                        Aristogenes.\n                    I wish now, men\n                    of the jury, to instruct you in detail also regarding the other claims which I\n                    make. They received from the wife of Polyeuctus a bowl, which they pawned\n                    together with some pieces of jewelry, and this they have not redeemed and\n                    brought into the general account, as Demophilus, to whom it was pawned, will\n                    testify. They have also some stuff for hangings, which they received, but they do not account for\n                    this either; and many more articles of the same sort. And finally, although my\n                    wife advanced a mina of silver and expended it on her father's behalf for the\n                    feast of the dead, the defendant\n                    refuses to contribute his share even of this; nay, what he has received he\n                    keeps; of other items he receives his due portion; but these claims he thus\n                    openly refuses to meet.Now that these matters too\n                    may not be left neglected, take, please, the depositions regarding them\n                        all.\n                    It may well be,\n                    men of the jury, that Spudias will make no statement to meet these facts; for he\n                    will not be able to do so, clever though he is; but will accuse Polyeuctus and\n                    his wife, and will declare that they did all these things under my influence and\n                    as favors to me, and that he is being greatly injured in many other respects,\n                    and has brought action against me; for this is what he undertook to say before\n                    the arbitrator also. But for my part, men of\n                    the jury, in the first place I do not think that a defence of that sort is\n                    legitimate, or that it is proper, when one is manifestly shown to be in the\n                    wrong, for him to shift the charges and have recourse to accusation and calumny;\n                    nay, for his counter-charges, if he is suffering any wrong, he will plainly\n                    receive satisfaction, but for the claims made on him, he will give it. For how\n                    could I now defend myself against the slanders of these men, if I passed over\n                    the matters upon which you are to give your verdict? In the next place I wonder, if he had true and just demands to make,\n                    why it was that, when our friends wished to settle our differences, and many\n                    conferences were held, he could not abide by their decision. And yet who could\n                    better have exposed the baselessness of claims advanced by him or by me than\n                    those who were present at all these transactions, who knew the facts as well as\n                    we did ourselves, and who were impartial friends of us both? But this was plainly not to the interest of my\n                    opponentthat he should be openly convicted by our friends and find a\n                    settlement in this way. For do not imagine, men of the jury, that men who know\n                    all these facts, and who now at their own risk are giving testimony in my favor,\n                    would then, when they had been put under oath, have formed a different\n                    conclusion about them. However, though you had none of these facts to aid you,\n                    even so it is not difficult to form an opinion as to which of the two parties is\n                    speaking the truth. For regarding the house,\n                    if he maintains that Polyeuctus was induced by me to order that mortgage-pillars\n                    be set up for the thousand drachmae, yet surely, Spudias, I did not use my\n                    influence to induce the witnesses to give false testimony in my\n                    interest,witnesses who were present when he betrothed to me his\n                    daughter, who knew that I received less than the entire marriage portion, who\n                    heard him when he acknowledged that he was in my debt and also when he had\n                    introduced Leocrates as the one who should make payment, and who finally were\n                    present when the will was made. For with all these persons it was no longer a\n                    question of favoring me in these matters, but of risking a charge of giving\n                    false testimony, if they deposed to what was not the truth. Let us, then, have\n                    no more of that matter; but what will you say to this, Spudias? And see that you give these gentlemen a precise\n                    answer. If he does not, do you all demand it of him. For, when Polyeuctus gave\n                    these directions in his will, the defendant's wife was present, and you may be\n                    sure that she reported to him the will of her father, especially if he did not\n                    receive an equal share, but was at a disadvantage in all respects; and the\n                    defendant himself was invited to be present, so that it is not open to him to\n                    say that we managed this in secret and kept them in the dark. For although he\n                    was invited to be present, he said that he was busy himself, but that it would\n                    be enough if his wife were there. What more would you have? When Aristogenes gave him an exact account of all\n                    these matters, even then he made no comment, and though Polyeuctus lived on more\n                    than five days after this, he neither showed any vexation on going to the house,\n                    nor made any protest, nor did his wife, who was present from the first on all\n                    these occasions. It would appear, then, that Polyeuctus was not induced by me to\n                    favor me in these matters; the act was your own. Keep these facts, then, clearly\n                    in your minds, men of the jury, and if he now tries to make any slanderous\n                    statements about the matter, confront him with them.But first, that you may be fully assured that matters are as I\n                    have stated, hear the witnesses. Read.\n                    Well then, men\n                    of the jury, in the matter of the one thousand drachmae, to prove that\n                    Polyeuctus mortgaged the house to me honestly, and for an existing debt, I have\n                    the testimony of my opponent himself and his wife in addition to these other\n                    witnesses whose depositions have been put in; for they concurred at the time,\n                    and made no objection either to Polyeuctus who lived so many days after, or to\n                    Aristogenes, when they first heard of the will. But assuredly, if the house was\n                    honestly mortgaged, it is impossible for you, if you bear the law in mind, to\n                    acquit Spudias as to this part of the case. Now consider also the matter of the twenty minae, which he does not bring into\n                    the account; for in this again the defendant himself will be my strongest\n                    witnessnot by words, heaven knows, such as he utters now in opposing\n                    my suitwords are a criterion of no worthbut by manifest\n                    act. By doing what, men of the jury? To this I bid you now to give close heed,\n                    in order that, if he really dares to utter any slanders about the mother of our\n                    wives or about the documents, your knowledge of the facts may make it impossible\n                    for him to deceive you by his talk. These papers were left by the wife of Polyeuctus, as I\n                    just now said. The seals being acknowledged both by the defendant's wife and by\n                    mine, we both, being present, broke them and took copies, and then sealed up the\n                    papers again, and deposited them in the hands of Aristogenes. Now, note this, men of the jury, note this, I beg of\n                    you. There was in the papers mention of the two minae, the price of the\n                    slaveand it was not only Polyeuctus on his death-bed who had made\n                    this claimand there was mention of the eighteen hundred drachmae.\n                    When he read this, if what was written did not concern him at all and was\n                    untrue, why pray did he not at once protest about it? Why did he join in sealing\n                    again papers which were false and of no worth? This of course no one in the\n                    world would do, if he did not concur in all that was written. But surely, men of the jury, this is an outrageous\n                    thing if these men are to be permitted now to dispute matters to which they have\n                    themselves given assent, and you are to find no basis for judgement in the fact\n                    that all of us are wont, when charges are made against us that are unjust and\n                    untrue, not to keep silent, but to dispute them on the spot, and that those who\n                    do not do this, if they contest them subsequently, are accounted rascals and\n                    tricksters. Now Spudias knows this as well as\n                    I, and I think even better, inasmuch as he comes oftener before your court, yet\n                    he feels no shame in saying things that contradict all that he has himself done.\n                    And yet full often when you become conscious of one single piece of fraud, you\n                    treat it as evidence against the other charges; but the defendant is found to\n                    have been convicted by himself of falsehood on every point.Take, please, the deposition, proving that the seals of the\n                    papers were acknowledged at the time by the wife of the defendant, and that the\n                    papers are now deposited, sealed by Spudias.\n                    Since, then,\n                    these facts have been so convincingly established, there is no further need, I\n                    think, of more words. For when I am able to produce both laws and witnesses in\n                    support of everything that I have said, and also admissions made in my favor by\n                    my opponent himself, what further need can there be for a long argument?\n                    However, if Spudias perchance waxes indignant about the marriage portion and\n                    maintains that he is being defrauded to the amount of one thousand drachmae, he\n                    will be lying. For, while he disputes my claim to this sum, he has received not\n                    less, but more, as will presently be made clear to you. Nay more, even if all these statements of his were\n                    indeed true, it is not just, I take it, if the laws are good for anything, that\n                    I should lose the marriage portion which was promised me, or that Polyeuctus, if\n                    he chose to give a smaller portion to one daughter and a larger to the other,\n                    should now be thwarted. For it was open to you, Spudias, not to marry his\n                    daughter, unless the thousand drachmae were given to you as well as to me.\n                    However you received no less than I, as I shall show.But, first, take the deposition which shows on what terms the\n                    lady was given to him.\n                    But how can it\n                    be that he has received as much as I, one may ask, if in his case the jewelry\n                    and the apparel, to the value of a thousand drachmae, were reckoned in the forty\n                    minae, while to me the ten minae were paid separately and in addition? This is\n                    precisely what I am going to explain. For Spudias, men of the jury, received his\n                    wife from Leocrates with the jewelry and apparel on which Polyeuctus set a value\n                    to Leocrates of more than a thousand drachmae, while in my case, if you set what\n                    was sent to me over and above the marriage portionall that I have in\n                    my possessionover against what was given to Spudias, you will find\n                    them practically equal over and above what was reckoned in the thousand\n                    drachmae; so that it was only fair that these\n                    articles should be included in the forty minae, seeing that Polyeuctus had\n                    charged them against Leocrates, and they were more than had been given\n                        me.Now please take this inventory and read to\n                    the jurymen what each of us has in his possession; after that, read the\n                    deposition of the arbitrators, that they may see that Spudias has received even\n                    far more than I, and that Leocrates made complaint regarding this, and that the\n                    arbitrators rendered this decision.\n                    Is it not\n                    plain, then, that the defendant has long had in his possession forty minae as\n                    his wife's marriage portion, whereas I received the thirty minae, just as he\n                    did, but not only did not receive the thousand drachmae, but am now actually in\n                    jeopardy regarding them, charged with possessing them wrongfully. It was for\n                    this reason, men of the jury, that Spudias would not leave to our friends the\n                    settlement of his claims against me, since the result would have been that all\n                    these falsehoods of his would have been exposed, for they had been present at\n                    all these transactions and knew all about them, and would therefore not have\n                    permitted him to say whatever he pleased; whereas in your court he thinks that\n                    by his falsehoods he will get the better of me and my statement of the truth.\n                        And yet I have set forth to you clearly\n                    all my charges, as well as I could do it myself, while my opponent evaded coming\n                    before those acquainted with the facts thinking that he would be unable to lead\n                    them astray. Do not you, then, men of the jury, do not you any more than they\n                    suffer him to have recourse to lies and calumnies, but bear in mind what you\n                    have heard; for you know all the facts of the case, unless perhaps I have\n                    omitted something, since I have been forced to speak with but scant water in the\n                    water-clock."}}, {"@type": "speech", "@n": "42", "head": "Against Phaenippus", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "13"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "14"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "15"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "16"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "17"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "18"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "19"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "21"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "22"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "23"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "24"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "25"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "26"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "27"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "28"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "29"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "30"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "31"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "32"}], "note": [{"@resp": "Loeb", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The month Boedromion corresponds to the latter\n                        half of September and the prior half of October."}, {"@resp": "Loeb", "@anchored": "yes", "date": {"@value": "1200", "#text": "1200"}, "bibl": [{"title": "Publ.

For if he had not clearly defined for us what is the first\n                    thing to be done by those who have offered an exchange, and what the second, and\n                    so on in due order, I do not know to what lengths the audacity of this man\n                    Phaenippus would have gone, when even as it is, notwithstanding that the law\n                    prescribes all these things for us, he has nevertheless disregarded its just\n                    provisions, and instead of giving me the inventory of his property as the law\n                    prescribes within three days after he took the oath, or if he did not wish to do\n                    so then, giving it at least on the sixth day of the month Boedromion, which date was fixed\n                    upon at his request, and on which he promised to deliver the inventory, he did\n                    neither the one thing nor the other, but,\n                    showing contempt both for me and for the law, he has delivered his inventory a\n                    month later, only two or three days before the case was brought into court, and\n                    all the rest of the time has kept himself out of sight; and instead of leaving\n                    untouched the seals which I had put upon the buildings, he went into the\n                    country, opened the buildings, and carried off the barley and other things, just\n                    as if the law had granted him the privilege of doing whatever he pleases, and\n                    not what is right. For my part, men of the\n                    jury, I should be most happy to see myself enjoying the material prosperity\n                    which was mine before, and remaining in the group of the Three Hundred, but since, partly through having\n                    to share in the misfortunes common to all those who are engaged in mining works,\n                    and partly through having met heavy reverses in my private business, I have lost\n                    my estate, and now at the last must pay three talents to the state, a talent for\n                    each share for I too was a partner, as I wish I had not been, in the\n                    confiscated mine, I am compelled\n                    to try to substitute in my place a man who is not only richer than I am now, but\n                    was richer even before my losses, and who has never borne any state services,\n                    nor made any contribution to the state. I\n                    therefore beg of you all, men of the jury, that, if I prove that Phaenippus here\n                    has both transgressed the just provisions of the law and is a richer man than\n                    myself, you will succor me, and appoint him in the list of the Three Hundred in\n                    my stead; for it is on this account that the laws every year provide for the\n                    tendering of exchanges, because to enjoy unbroken prosperity is not wont to be\n                    the permanent fortune of any large number of our citizens. But I will tell you\n                    all that has been done regarding the exchange from the very beginning.\n                        On the\n                    second day of the month Metageitnion, men of the jury, the generals appointed a court for the\n                    Three Hundred for the tendering of exchanges. Among these I cited this man\n                    Phaenippus as the law provides. After citing him, I took some of my friends and\n                    relatives, and proceeded to his outlying farm at Cytherus. And first\n                    I led them around the farm, the circuit of which was more than forty\n                        stades, and pointed out to them, and called them to witness in the\n                    presence of Phaenippus, that there were no mortgage-pillars\n                    on the farm, and I bade Phaenippus, if he said there were, to declare it at once\n                    and point them out to me, for fear some debt existing against the property might\n                    be brought to light later on. Then I sealed the\n                    buildings, and bade Phaenippus to proceed to my property. After this I asked him\n                    where his threshed grain was, for by the gods and goddesses, men of the jury,\n                    there were two threshing-floors there, each one of nearly a plethron in\n                        extent. He\n                    answered me that some of the grain had been sold, and that some was stored\n                    within. Finally, to make a long story short, I\n                    stationed men inside to keep watch, and by Zeus I gave strict orders to the\n                    ass-drivers and made them stop carrying off timber from the farm for\n                    in addition to the rest of his property Phaenippus has also this very\n                    considerable source of revenue: six asses carry off wood the whole year through,\n                    and he receives more than twelve drachmae a day. I forbade the\n                    ass-drivers, as I said, to touch the wood, and after giving notice to Phaenippus\n                    to attend the sacrifice, as the law commands, I went back to the\n                    city. First,\n                    now, I will produce for you the depositions substantiating what I have said, and\n                    then you shall hear the entire truth about the other aspects of the case. For\n                    you will find, men of the jury, that this fellow Phaenippus began from the very\n                    first day to act in utter disregard of right. I sealed the buildings, as the law\n                    permitted me; he opened them. And he acknowledges that he removed the seal, but\n                    does not acknowledge that he opened the door, as if men removed the seals for\n                    any other purpose than to open the doors. Then\n                    I had forbidden that wood should be carried off; he carried it off every day\n                    except that on which I issued the order. There was no debt charged against the\n                    farm; he now reports a number of debts. In a word, he does just what he pleases,\n                    not what the laws bid him do.Read the\n                    depositions, first those concerning the mine, and then the others as well.\n                    The wrongs,\n                    therefore, which Phaenippus began to do to me beginning with the very first day\n                    after the tendering of the exchanges, you have heard, men of , both from myself and from the\n                    witnesses; but the things which he did after this have been offences, not\n                    against me only, but also against the laws, to the defence of which you are all\n                    bound to rally. For although he had sworn on\n                    the eleventh of the month Boedromion to give me a true and just inventory of his\n                    property, and the law expressly declares that the inventory shall be given\n                    within three days after one takes the oath, he came up to me in front of the\n                    courtrooms with Polyeuctus of Crioa and some others, and begged me, first to\n                    have a conference with him regarding a settlement, assuring me that he would do\n                    everything that was right; and, secondly, to put off the declaration regarding\n                    the property for a few days only for he said he understood my\n                    position. I, on my part, thinking it\n                    was becoming to a good citizen who wished to avoid quarrels not to rush headlong\n                    into court, was persuaded for why should I multiply words?\n                    to consent that the conference regarding a settlement should take place on the\n                    twenty-third of the month Boedromion, and the declaration regarding the property\n                    on the twenty-fifth. Yet, although he had obtained both his requests from me,\n                    Phaenippus did not present himself on either of these days; instead, he now\n                    appears before you as one who has transgressed two laws instead of\n                    one;first, that which declares that the inventory shall be presented\n                    within three days after that on which one takes the oath, and, secondly, that\n                    which declares that mutual covenants, agreed upon in the presence of witnesses,\n                    shall be binding. Yet, men of the jury, who\n                    among you does not know that the day fixed by law and that agreed upon by the\n                    contending parties are equally binding? Why, very often, although the thirtieth\n                    day is appointed by law, we fix upon another by mutual agreement; and in all the\n                    offices the magistrates put off trials and judgements for the contestants, when\n                    these have come to a mutual agreement; and if anyone should hold that the\n                    agreement thus entered upon was to be of no effect, you would despise him as a\n                    cheat without equal. Well then, Phaenippus,\n                    just as though the law enjoined that one should do nothing that one had agreed\n                    to, from the day on which he promised to meet me for a settlement and to give me\n                    an inventory of his property and receive from me one of mine, never put in an\n                    appearance; but I, when I saw that he was paying no heed to me or to the laws,\n                    gave in my inventory at the office of the generals, whereas Phaenippus, as I\n                    said a moment ago, gave me a paper only the other day with no other purpose than\n                    that he might appear to have given me his inventory, but that I should be unable\n                    to make any use of its contents. But, men of\n                    the jury, you should not grant more than their due to those who hold their own\n                    shamelessness to be stronger than the laws; if you do, you will multiply the\n                    numbers of those who mock at the just provisions of the laws. No; you should\n                    succor those who regard the voice of the laws as your voice, and the day\n                    appointed for coming into court as established in the interest of those who have\n                    been wronged, not of those who have done wrong. Read the depositions in support of what I\n                    have just said, and the laws.Having, then, been thus treated by\n                    Phaenippus, men of the jury, I reported to the generals the following inventory\n                    of my property. Read.\n                    How else, then,\n                    in the name of the gods and divinities, men of the jury, should one prove that\n                    Phaenippus is liable under the laws which have been read, than precisely in the\n                    way in which I am proving it? Yet Phaenippus has none the less brought a\n                    counter-charge against me that I am not rendering a just inventory of my\n                    property; so easy is it for men of his stamp to make false statements before\n                    you; and he complains of the oath which I took before filing the inventory,\n                    asserting that I undertook to report all the rest of my property except that in\n                    the mining-works;as if to swear according to law were a matter for\n                    complaint! But you know the law, men of the\n                    jury, for you enacted it, that which expressly makes this provision, that those\n                    tendering exchanges to one another, when they under oath report their\n                    inventories, shall swear also the following oath: I will give a true\n                    and honest inventory of my property except that in the silver mines, all of\n                    which the laws have made exempt from taxes. But, rather, read the law itself. Yet, stop a moment, please. For I\n                    made this offer before to Phaenippus, and now again, men of the jury, I tender\n                    it freely:I will surrender to him all my property including that in\n                    the mining works, if he will hand over to me the farm alone free from all\n                    encumbrances as it was when I first went to it with witnesses, and will replace\n                    as they were before the grain and wine and the other things which he has carried\n                    away from the buildings after removing the seals from the doors. Why, pray, do you keep on talking and crying out?\n                    From my silver mines, Phaenippus, I formerly by my own bodily toil and labor\n                    reaped a large profit. I confess it. But now I have lost all but a small portion\n                    of my gains. You, on the contrary, since you sell from your farm your barley at\n                    a price of eighteen drachmae and your wine at a price of twelve, are a rich man,\n                    naturally, for you make more than a thousand medimni of grain and above eight hundred measures\n                    of wine. Ought I, then, to continue in the\n                    same class, when the same fortune does not attend me now as formerly? Do not\n                    demand that; it would not be just. No; do you also take your turn and share for\n                    a little while in the class that performs public services, since those engaged\n                    in mining have suffered reverses while you farmers are prospering beyond what is\n                    your due. For a considerable time you have enjoyed the income of two estates,\n                    that of your natural father, Callippus, and that of him who adopted you,\n                    Philostratus, the orator, and you have never done anything for your\n                    fellow-citizens here.\n                    Yet my father left to each of us, my brother\n                    and myself, an estate of forty-five minae merely, on which it is not easy to\n                    live, while your fathers were possessed of such wealth that each of them set up\n                    a tripod in honor of choregic victories at the Dionysia. And I do not begrudge\n                    them this, for it is the duty of the wealthy to render service to the state. Do\n                    you, therefore, show that you have expended one single copper coin on the\n                    stateyou, who have inherited two estates which performed public\n                    services. But you cannot show it, for you have\n                    learned secrecy and evasion and how to do everything to escape rendering service\n                    to your fellow-citizens here. But I will show that I have expended large\n                    sumsI, who inherited that slender estate from my father.Now read me first that law which declares that no mining\n                    property shall be included in the inventory, and the challenge and then the\n                    depositions proving that this fellow Phaenippus has inherited two estates that\n                    performed public services.\n                    There is one\n                    thing only, men of the jury, in which anyone could show that this man Phaenippus\n                    has been ambitious of honor from you: he is an able and ambitious breeder of\n                        horses, being young and rich and vigorous.\n                    What is a convincing proof of this? He has given up riding on horseback, has\n                    sold his war horse, and in his place has bought himself a chariothe,\n                    at his age!that he may not have to travel on foot; such is the luxury\n                    that fills him. This chariot he has included in his inventory to me, but of the\n                    barley and wine and the rest of the farm-produce not a tenth part. He deserves then, does he not, to be let off now,\n                    seeing that he has been so public-spirited and ambitious to serve both with his\n                    property and his person? No; far from it. For it is the duty of honest jurymen\n                    to give respite to those citizens, when they have need of such help, who, when\n                    prosperous, willingly perform public services and remain in the list of the\n                    Three Hundred; but as to those who consider as lost whatever money they spend\n                    upon the state, you should bring them into the list of those who make advance\n                    contributions, and not suffer them to run away from their duty.Read first the deposition, and then his declaration.\n                    Enough of that.\n                    Yet Phaenippus, men of the jury, opened the rooms that had been sealed and\n                    carried off much that was within, as the witnesses have testified to you,\n                    leaving behind just what he pleased; and one month after the law prescribes gave\n                    me the declaration regarding his property. Nevertheless, enough of\n                        that.Read from the words, Upon\n                    this property I owe the following debts.\n                    Stop reading.\n                    This Aristono, men of the jury, is the daughter of Philostratus and\n                    mother of Phaenippus. He declares that a debt is owing to her for her marriage\n                    portion, but of this the laws make him the owner. His statement\n                    is therefore false, and he does not make a just declaration. For why is it that\n                    I, Phaenippus, while my motherwho brought with her a marriage\n                    portionis living and dwelling in my house, do not declare the\n                    marriage portion as a debt due to her, and thus try to lead the jurymen astray,\n                    but permit her to share in all that I have, alike whether it shall prove to be\n                    the estate of Phaenippus or my own? Because the laws so command, my good Sir.\n                    But all that you do is contrary to the laws. Read on.\n                    You hear, men\n                    of the jury. He declares that he owes upon the land to Pamphilus and Pheidoleus\n                    of Rhamnus jointly a talent, and to Aeantides of Phlyus\n                    four thousand drachmae, and to Aristomenes of Anagyrus\n                    fourteen minae. Why, then, Phaenippus, when I asked you in the presence of\n                    witnesses whether you owed anything on your farm, and bade you show me the\n                    pillar of mortgage, if one were set up anywhere upon it, and and adjured you not\n                    to have any fictitious creditors to be brought to light later on to my\n                    prejudicewhy, pray, did you not reveal any of these debts then? And\n                    why, when you have been a month late in giving me your declaration, though the\n                    law bids that it be given within three days, have creditors and debts for more\n                    than three talents now come on the scene? Because, my good Sir, it is merely this that you are contriving, that you may\n                    now have private debts equal in amount to the public debt which I have incurred\n                    to the state. But that your statement is false, Phaenippus, and that you have\n                    come before these gentlemen as a perjured man, I shall straightway prove beyond\n                    all question.Please, clerk, take the deposition\n                    of Aeantides and Theoteles to whom this fellow has declared that he owes four\n                    thousand drachmae. His declaration is false, and he long ago paid the debt, not\n                    willingly, but after a judgement had been secured against him. Read.\n                    Well, then, men\n                    of the jury, when a man has made out a declaration that is so manifestly false\n                    in all points and has shown no regard for the laws which define the time within\n                    which the declaration must be made out, or to the private agreements which we\n                    hold to be equally binding; when besides this he has opened the seals of the\n                    buildings and carried off the grain and wine from within, and furthermore has\n                    after the offer to exchange sold the cut timber to the value of more than thirty\n                    minae; and when worst of all he has concocted false debts\n                    for the purpose of the exchangewill you decide by your votes that\n                    this man has made a just declaration? Surely not, men of the jury. For where is one to turn if he fails of a verdict\n                    from you, when men of wealth who have never been of any service to you, who\n                    produce large quantities of grain and wine and dispose of this at three times\n                    its former price, have an advantage in your courts? Let not this happen now, I\n                    beg of you; but, as you have given public aid to all those engaged in mining, so\n                    now give aid to me as a private citizen. For,\n                    if I had been your slave and not a citizen, seeing my industry and my goodwill\n                    toward you, you would have given me respite from my expenditures and would have\n                    turned to one of the rest who was running away from his duty. In the same\n                    manner, when I shall have paid the three talents for which I became liable to\n                    you, and shall have recovered my losses, you will relieve some other person\n                    among those in distress and turn to me. But for the present discharge me, men of\n                    the jury, I beg of you all; and since I have spoken only what is just, I implore\n                    you to come to my aid, and not to suffer me to be harried by these men."}}, {"@type": "speech", "@n": "43", "head": "Against Macartatus", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit":

We\n                    therefore beg of you, men of the jury, to listen to our arguments with goodwill,\n                    and to follow with close attention. And I, on my part, will endeavor to give you\n                    the clearest information I can concerning the facts. The mother of this boy, men of the\n                    jury, being the nearest of kin to Hagnias of Oeon, had the\n                    estate of Hagnias adjudged to her according to your laws; and of those who then\n                    made counter-claims to this estate not one ventured to swear that he was nearer\n                    of kin than the lady for it was admitted by all that the inheritance\n                    belonged to her by virtue of nearest kinship, but Glaucus of Oeon and Glaucon his brother presented\n                    themselves, having concocted a spurious will, and Theopompus, the father of\n                    Macartatus here, joined with them in getting up this whole scheme, and was their\n                    witness in most of the depositions that were put in. The will which they then\n                    produced was proved to be spurious, and they not only lost their case, but went\n                    out of court completely disgraced. And\n                    Theopompus, the father of Macartatus here, although he was in town when the\n                    herald asked by proclamation whether anyone wished to lay claim to the estate of\n                    Hagnias by virtue of kinship or under a will, or to deposit security for the\n                    costs of such claim, yet did not venture to make a deposit, but by his own act\n                    gave judgement against himself that he had no conceivable claim on the estate of\n                    Hagnias. But, although the mother of this boy\n                    here became possessed of the inheritance, since she had prevailed in the suit\n                    over all those who disputed her claim, these men are abominable, as you see, and\n                    imagine that they need obey neither your laws nor the decisions of your courts,\n                    but they are trying by fair means or foul once more to take away from the lady\n                    the inheritance which you awarded to her. A\n                    conspiracy was formed, and a written agreement entered into, and deposited with\n                    Medeius of Hagnus, by Theopompus, the father of Macartatus here, and by\n                    Glaucon and the Glaucus who was worsted in the former suit; and they added to\n                    themselves as a fourth another of their friends Eupolemus was his\n                    name. All these men, having in common formed their plot, cited the\n                    lady before the archon for the adjudication of claims to the estate of Hagnias,\n                    declaring that the law prescribed that if anyone wished to enter a claim,\n                    citation should be made of the one to whom the estate had been adjudged and who\n                    had it in his possession. And when the archon\n                    brought the case into court, and the trial was to be held, they had everything\n                    cleverly arranged for the trial, and in particular the water which was to\n                    measure their speeches was four times as much as that allowed to us. For the\n                    archon, men of the jury, was obliged to pour into the water-clock an\n                        amphora of water for each claimant, and three choes for the\n                    reply; so that I, who acted as pleader for the\n                    lady, was not only unable to explain to the jurymen the relationship and other\n                    matters as clearly as I could have wished, but could not even defend myself\n                    against the smallest fraction of the lies which they told about us; for I had\n                    but a fifth part of the water. Their scheme was this: to tell a wholly false\n                    story about us, but to back one another up and agree in everything. So, since they had formed their plot in this way, and\n                    each backed up the other's charges against us, when the four ballot-boxes were set out according to law, the jurymen,\n                    naturally enough, as I think, were deceived and could not agree with one\n                    another, and being led astray by this trick, they voted each as chance\n                    determined. And there were a very few more votessome three or\n                    fourin the box of Theopompus than in that of the lady. This, then, was what\n                    took place at that time. But when this boy was born, and it seemed a fitting\n                    time, I, being in no way incensed at what had happened, but considering that the\n                    former jurymen had met with a very natural experience, introduced this boy here\n                    to the clansmen of Hagnias in the interest of Eubulides, seeing that the boy was\n                    the son of his daughter, in order that the family might not become extinct.\n                        For the elder Eubulides, men of the jury,\n                    who was next of kin to Hagnias, prayed to the gods above all else that a son\n                    might be born to him as a daughter had been, the mother of this boy; but since\n                    he failed of this hope and not a single male child was born to him, his next\n                    dearest wish was that a son of his daughter should be adopted into his own\n                    family and that of Hagnias and should be introduced to the members of his clan;\n                    for he thought, men of the jury, that of his surviving relatives this boy was\n                    nearest to him, and that in this way their house would best be preserved and\n                    kept from extinction. And I was the one to\n                    render him this service, since I was husband to the daughter of Eubulides, she\n                    having been adjudged to me as being the nearest of kin, and I introduced this\n                    boy to the clansmen of Hagnias and Eubulides, to which fellowship Theopompus,\n                    the father of Macartatus here, belonged during his lifetime, and to which\n                    Macartatus now belongs. And the\n                    fellow-clansmen of Macartatus here, who knew better than any others the pedigree\n                    of the family, seeing that he himself did not choose to risk a contest and did\n                    not remove the victim from the altar, as he should have done had the\n                    introduction of this boy not been legitimate, but demanded that they commit\n                    perjury,6 took the ballot while the victims were still burning, and carried it\n                    from the altar of Zeus Phatrius in the presence of the defendant Macartatus, and gave a\n                    just verdict, men of the jurythat this boy was duly and rightfully\n                    introduced as the adopted son of Eubulides into the family of Hagnias.\n                        But when the fellow-clansmen of the\n                    defendant Macartatus had passed this vote, this boy, as the son of Eubulides,\n                    cited the defendant Macartatus for an adjudication of claims for the estate of\n                    Hagnias, and had a day appointed by the archon for the hearing, inscribing his\n                    brother's name as his guardian; for it was no longer open to me, men of the\n                    jury, to stand inscribed as guardian, since I had got the boy adopted into the\n                    family of Eubulides. And the citation was made by this boy according to the same\n                    laws in accordance with which these men had cited his mother, who had won the\n                    former suit in court, and was in possession of the estate of Hagnias. Please read the law\n                    which ordains that citation shall be made of the person possessing the\n                        inheritance.\n                    You have heard\n                    the law, and it is a reasonable request I make of you, men of the jury. If I\n                    shall prove to you that this boy Eubulides here and Phylomach, who is\n                    the mother of the boy and the daughter of Eubulides, are nearer of kin to\n                    Hagnias than Theopompus, the father of Macartatus, and not only that they are\n                    nearest of kin, but that there is absolutely no human being belonging to the\n                    house of Hagnias except the mother of this boy and the boy himself,if\n                    I shall prove this, I beg of you, men of the jury, to give your aid to us.\n                        At the\n                    first, men of the jury, it was my intention to write on a board all the kinsfolk\n                    of Hagnias, and thus to exhibit them to you one by one; but when I saw plainly\n                    that not all the jurymen would have an equally good view, but that those sitting\n                    at a distance would be at a disadvantage, it is perhaps necessary to instruct\n                    you by word of mouth, for thus all will be on the same footing. I, on my part,\n                    will endeavor to the best of my ability to inform you regarding the family of\n                    Hagnias in the fewest words possible. Buselus, men of the jury, was a member of\n                    the deme Oeon, and to him were born five sons, Hagnias and Eubulides and\n                    Stratius and Habron and Cleocritus. And all these sons of Buselus grew up to\n                    manhood, and their father Buselus divided his property among them all fairly and\n                    equitably, as was fitting. And when they had divided the property among\n                    themselves, each of them married a wife according to your laws, and sons and\n                    grandsons were born to them all, and there sprang up five households from the\n                    single one of Buselus; and they dwelt apart, each one having his own home and\n                    begetting his descendants. Now with regard to\n                    three of the brothers, sons of Buselus, and the descendants born to them, why\n                    should I trouble you, men of the jury, or myself by going into particulars about\n                    each one? For although they are in the same degree of relationship as\n                    Theopompus, and are as near of kin to Hagnias, whose estate is in question, not\n                    one of them has ever troubled us either at an earlier time or now, nor has made\n                    any claim to the estate of Hagnias or to the woman who is the heiress, who was\n                    assigned in marriage to me; for they considered that they had no claim whatever\n                    to anything belonging to Hagnias. It seems to\n                    me therefore that it would be entirely superfluous to say anything about them\n                    save only what I cannot help mentioning. Of Theopompus, however, the father of\n                    Macartatus, and of Macartatus the defendant himself, it is necessary for me to\n                    speak. Yet the story, men of the jury, is a short one. As you have just heard,\n                    Buselus had five sons. One of these was Stratius, the ancestor of Macartatus,\n                    and another was Hagnias, the ancestor of this boy. To Hagnias was born a son, Polemon, and a daughter,\n                    Phylomach, sister of Polemon by the same father and the same mother;\n                    and to Stratius, the brother of Hagnias, there were born Phanostratus and\n                    Charidemus, the grandfather of the defendant Macartatus. Now I ask you, men of\n                    the jury, which is nearer of kin and more closely related to Hagnias, his son\n                    Polemon and his daughter Phylomach, or Charidemus, the son of\n                    Stratius, and nephew of Hagnias? For my part I think that to every one of us his\n                    son and daughter are more nearly related than his nephew; and not only with us\n                    does this hold good, but also among all other people whether Greeks or\n                    barbarians. Since, then, this is admitted, you\n                    will now easily follow the rest of the argument men of the jury, and you will\n                    see how arbitrary and how reckless these men are. To Polemon, son of Hagnias,\n                    was born a son, Hagnias, having the name of his grandfather Hagnias, and this\n                    second Hagnias died without issue. But from\n                    Phylomach, the sister of Polemon, and Philagrus, to whom her brother\n                    Polemon had given her in marriage, he being his first cousin for\n                    Philagrus was the son of Eubulides, the brother of\n                    Hagniasfrom Philagrus, I say, the cousin of Polemon, and\n                    Phylomach the sister of Polemon, there was born Eubulides the father\n                    of this boy's mother. These sons, then, were born to Polemon and to Polemon's\n                    sister Phylomach. But to Charidemus, the son of Stratius, there was\n                    born a son Theopompus, the father of the defendant Macartatus. Again, then, I ask you, men of the jury, which is\n                    nearer of kin and more closely related to the first Hagnias, Hagnias, the son of\n                    Polemon, and Eubulides, the son of Phylomach and Philagrus, or\n                    Theopompus, the son of Charidemus and grandson of Stratius? I am of the opinion,\n                    men of the jury, that if the son and the daughter are the nearest of kin, so,\n                    too, the son's son and the daughter's son are more nearly related than the son\n                    of a nephew and one who is a member of another branch of the family. Well, to Theopompus was born a son, Macartatus, the\n                    defendant, and to Eubulides, the son of Phylomach, and cousin of\n                    Hagnias on his father's side; this boy, who is to Hagnias the son of a first\n                    cousin on the father's side; since Phylomach, the mother of Eubulides\n                    and Polemon, the father of Hagnias, were brother and sister, born of the same\n                    father and the same mother. But to Macartatus here, the son of Theopompus, there\n                    has been no issue which is both in the family of Hagnias and in that of\n                    Stratius. Such being the facts, this boy here\n                    has one of the titles mentioned in the law, and up to which the law ordains that\n                    the right of succession should extend; for he is the child of the first cousin\n                    of Hagnias, since his father Eubulides was cousin to Hagnias, whose inheritance\n                    is in question. Theopompus, on the contrary, the father of the defendant\n                    Macartatus, could not have appropriated to himself any one of the titles\n                    mentioned in the law, for he belonged to another branch of the family, that of\n                    Stratius. But it is not fitting, men of the\n                    jury, that any man whatsoever should possess the estate of Hagnias, one who\n                    belongs to another branch, so long as there is left any one of those born of the\n                    branch of Hagnias; no, nor is it right to expel such person by violence, as\n                    these men are trying to do, while they are themselves more distantly related,\n                    and not of the same branch of the family. For this, men of the jury, is the\n                    point upon which Theopompus, the father of the defendant Macartatus, misled the\n                    jury. Who, then, are those still surviving in\n                    the branch of Hagnias? Phylomach, my wife, who is the daughter of\n                    Eubulides, the cousin of Hagnias, and this boy, who has been adopted into the\n                    family of Eubulides and Hagnias. Theopompus, however, the father of the\n                    defendant Macartatus, not being himself of the branch of Hagnias, told the\n                    jurymen a monstrous lie regarding Phylomach, the sister of Polemon\n                    and the aunt of Hagnias, alleging that she was not the sister of Polemon, the\n                    son of Hagnias, by the same father and mother, and another in pretending that he\n                    himself was of the same family as Hagnias, whereas he had never belonged to it.\n                        All these assertions Theopompus made\n                    fearlessly, not producing any witness who would have been responsible to us, but\n                    having only his associates to corroborate what he said; for they were leagued\n                    with one another and did everything in concert, in order to rob the lady, the\n                    mother of this boy here, of the inheritance which you by your votes had decided\n                    to be hers. I wish now, men of the jury, to\n                    produce witnesses in support of the statements which I have made to\n                    youfirst, to prove that Phylomach, the daughter of\n                    Eubulides, won judgement for the estate of Hagnias as being the nearest of kin,\n                    and then to establish the rest of the facts.Read\n                    the deposition.\n                    That\n                    Phylomach, the daughter of Eubulides, won judgement for the estate of\n                    Hagnias, you have heard, men of the jury. And she won it, not by wrongful\n                    trickery or conspiracy, but in the fairest manner possible, since we proved that\n                    she was nearest of kin to Hagnias, whose estate is in question, being the\n                    daughter of his cousin on his father's side, and being of the same branch as\n                    Hagnias. When, therefore, Macartatus says that\n                    his father Theopompus won judgement for this estate, make answer to him on your\n                    part, men of the jury, that the lady also won judgement before Theopompus, the\n                    defendant's father, and that the lady won her case fairly, since she was of the\n                    same branch as Hagnias, being the daughter of Eubulides, the cousin of Hagnias,\n                    but that Theopompus did not win the suit, but prevailed by trickery, being\n                    himself in no sense whatever of the branch of Hagnias. Make this reply to him yourselves, men of the jury, and also state\n                    that against this boy Eubulides, son of Eubulides, son of the first cousin on\n                    his father's side of Hagnias, whose estate is in question, neither Theopompus,\n                    the father of Macartatus, nor any other man ever at any time won a judgement. At\n                    the present time the contest and the trial to adjudge the estate of Hagnias are\n                    between this son of Eubulides and the defendant Macartatus, the son of\n                    Theopompus; and whichever of these two shall in your judgement speak most in\n                    harmony with justice and the laws, to him, it is plain, you jurymen will give\n                    your votes. Read the remaining depositions; first, those proving that\n                    Phylomach, the aunt of Hagnias, was sister by the same father and the\n                    same mother to Polemon, the father of Hagnias; after that he shall read all the\n                    other depositions which have to do with the pedigree.\n                    \n                    \n                    In the former\n                    trial, men of the jury, when these men formed their conspiracy with one another\n                    and acted in concert, the whole group of them, in their contest against the\n                    lady, we, on our part, men of the jury, neither prepared depositions regarding\n                    facts that were admitted, nor summoned witnesses, but thought that in these\n                    matters at least we were perfectly safe; whereas our opponents had equipped\n                    themselves with all manner of shameless artifices for the trial, and had their\n                    minds set upon this thing aloneto deceive the jurymen for the moment.\n                        They had the audacity to assert that\n                    Polemon, the father of Hagnias, had no sister at all born of the same father and\n                    the same mother; so abominably impudent were they, seeking to mislead the\n                    jurymen in a matter of such importance and so well-known, and they spent all\n                    their efforts and strove beyond all else to establish this. We have, however, on\n                    this present occasion produced this host of witnesses regarding the sister of\n                    Polemon and aunt of Hagnias. On the\n                    defendant's side let whoever will give evidence either that Polemon and\n                    Phylomach were not brother and sister, born of the same father and\n                    the same mother, or that Polemon was not the son, and Phylomach not\n                    the daughter, of Hagnias, the son of Buselus; or that Polemon was not the father\n                    of Hagnias, whose estate is in question, and\n                    Phylomach, the sister of Polemon, not his aunt; or that Eubulides was\n                    not the son of Phylomach, or of Philagrus, the cousin of Hagnias; or\n                    this, that the still-living Phylomach is not the daughter of\n                    Eubulides, the cousin of Hagnias, and this boy not his son, adopted according to\n                    your laws into the family of Eubulides or that Theopompus, the father of the\n                    defendant, Macartatus, belonged to the branch of Hagnias. Let anyone give\n                    testimony in his favor on whatever one of these points he chooses. But I know\n                    well that no mortal man will be so daring or so senseless. However, that it may\n                    be the more clear to you, men of the jury, that in the former trial they got the\n                    upper hand through their shameless audacity, and that they advanced no just\n                    arguments, read all the depositions that remain.\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    It was\n                    necessary to read these depositions, men of the jury, in order that we might not\n                    suffer the same experience as before, by being caught by these men unprepared.\n                    But far more convincing even than these shall be the testimony that Macartatus\n                    will give against himself, proving that neither his father Theopompus nor\n                    himself has any claim whatever to inherit anything from Hagnias, Theopompus\n                    being less near of kin, and belonging to quite a different branch of the family.\n                        For suppose one should ask, men of the\n                    jury, Who is the person who disputes this boy's title to the estate of Hagnias?\n                    I know well that he would say, Macartatus. Born of what father? Theopompus. And\n                    of what mother? Apolexis, daughter of a Prospaltian, and\n                    sister of Macartatus, also a Prospaltian. And who was the father of Theopompus?\n                    Charidemus. And of whom was Charidemus the son? Of Stratius. And of whom\n                    Stratius? Of Buselus. This, men of the jury, is the branch of Stratius, one of\n                    the sons of Buselus; and these whose names you have heard are descendants of\n                    Stratius; and among them there is not one single name of those belonging to the\n                    branch of Hagnias, or even one that is similar. Now again I shall question this boy, asking who he is who contests the claim\n                    of Macartatus to the estate of Hagnias. The boy can make no other possible\n                    answer, men of the jury, than that he is Eubulides. The son of what father? Of\n                    Eubulides, the cousin of Hagnias. And of what mother? Of Phylomach,\n                    who was the daughter of a first cousin to Hagnias on the father's side. But of\n                    whom was Eubulides the son? Of Philagrus, the cousin of Hagnias. And of what\n                    mother? Of Phylomach, the aunt of Hagnias. And of whom was Hagnias the son? Of Polemon. And of whom Polemon? Of\n                    Hagnias. And of whom Hagnias? Of Buselus. This is another branch, that of\n                    Hagnias, one of the sons of Buselus, and here there occurs not a single name\n                    identical with those of the descendants in the branch of Stratius, or even one\n                    that is similar; but they proceed in the branch of Hagnias with their own series\n                    of names, receiving them from one another. In every respect, then, and in every\n                    way it is proved that these men belong to another branch of the family and are\n                    more remote of kin, and that they are not entitled to inherit anything of the\n                    estate of Hagnias. For to show you to whom the law-giver grants the right of\n                    succession and inheritance, the clerk will read you these laws. \n                    The law, men of\n                    the jury, expressly declares to whom the inheritance shall go. Not, by Heaven,\n                    to Theopompus nor to Macartatus, the son of Theopompus, who are in no sense\n                    whatever of the family of Hagnias. But to whom does it give the inheritance? To\n                    the descendants of Hagnias, to those who are in his branch of the family. This\n                    is what the law says, and this is what justice demands. Now, then, men of the\n                    jury, the law-giver has not given these rights to the relatives without imposing\n                    upon them in the law a large number of duties, which the relatives must of\n                    necessity perform. No; there are full many obligations laid upon the relatives\n                    to perform for which the law admits of no excuse; they must absolutely be\n                        performed.But, preferably, read the law\n                    itselfthe first one. \n                    You hear what\n                    the law says, men of the jury. But when it became necessary to sue for the hand\n                    of the heiress Phylomach, the mother of this boy and the daughter of\n                    the first cousin of Hagnias on his father's side, I came forward out of respect\n                    for the law and preferred my suit as being next of kin; but Theopompus, the\n                    father of Macartatus, neither came forward nor in any way disputed my claim,\n                    because he had no semblance of right, although he was of the same age as she.\n                        And yet, men of the jury, how can you fail\n                    to think it strange that Theopompus never made any claim for the hand of the\n                    heiress, who was the daughter of the first cousin of Hagnias on his father's\n                    side, and yet demands to have the estate of Hagnias contrary to the laws? Could\n                    there be persons more shameless or more abominable than these?Read the other laws also. \n                    \n                    All these\n                    duties which the laws lay upon relatives to perform, they lay upon us, and\n                    compel us to perform them, men of the jury. But to Macartatus here they say not\n                    a word, nor to Theopompus, his father; for they belong in no sense to the family\n                    of Hagnias. Why, then, should the laws lay any duties upon them? But the defendant, men\n                    of the jury, while he has no just argument whatever to make against the laws and\n                    the depositions which we produce, makes a show of indignation, and says he is\n                    being cruelly treated because, his father being dead, it falls to him to be\n                    defendant in this suit. But he does not bear in mind, men of the jury, that his\n                    father was a mortal man, and has met his end along with many others both younger\n                    and older than himself. Yet if Theopompus, the father of the defendant, is dead,\n                    the laws are not dead, nor is justice, nor are the jurymen with whom the verdict\n                    rests. The present contest and the present\n                    trial are not to decide whether one man has died before or after another, but\n                    whether or not it is right that the kinsmen of Hagnias, cousins and children of\n                    cousins to Hagnias on his father's side, should be driven out from the family of\n                    Hagnias by persons belonging to the family of Stratius, who have no shadow of\n                    right to inherit the estate of Hagnias, but are more remote of kin. This is the\n                    question at issue in the present trial. You will see even more clearly, men of the\n                    jury, from the following law, that the lawgiver Solon is very much in earnest in\n                    regard to those who are relatives, and not only gives them the property left by\n                    the deceased, but also lays upon them all the burdensome obligations.Read the law.\n                    The law does\n                    not allow any woman except female relatives within the degree of cousinship to\n                    enter the chamber where the deceased lies, and it permits these same women to\n                    follow to the tomb. Now Phylomach, the sister of Polemon, the father\n                    of Hagnias, was not cousin to Hagnias, but aunt; for she was sister to Polemon,\n                    the father of Hagnias. But Eubulides, the son of this woman, was cousin on his\n                    father's side to Hagnias, whose inheritance is in question. And the mother of\n                    this boy here was the daughter of Eubulides. These female relatives the law commanded to be present at the laying out of\n                    the deceased, and to follow to the tomb, not the mother of Macartatus nor the\n                    wife of Theopompus; for she was in no way related to Hagnias, but was of another\n                    tribe, the Acamantis, and of another deme, that of Prospalta, so that she was\n                    not even apprised in any way at the time Hagnias lay dead. It is surely a most outrageous result that these men\n                    are scheming to bring about, that forsooth we and the women of our family should\n                    inherit the body of Hagnias, when he was dead, and should perform all the proper\n                    rites, as being relatives and nearest of kin, but that Macartatus should claim\n                    the right to possess the estate of the dead Hagnias, though he belongs to the\n                    house of Stratius and is descended from Apolexis, daughter of the Prospaltian\n                    and sister of Macartatus. But this is neither just nor righteous, men of the\n                    jury. Now\n                    please read the words of the oracle brought from , from the shrine of the god, that you may see that it\n                    speaks in the same terms concerning relatives as do the laws of Solon.\n                    You hear, men\n                    of the jury, that Solon in the laws and the god in the oracle use the same\n                    language, bidding the relatives to perform rites for the departed on the proper\n                    days. But neither Theopompus nor the defendant Macartatus cared at all for these\n                    things; they cared only for this, that they might retain possession of what does\n                    not belong to them, and to complain that after having had the estate for so\n                    long, they must now defend their title to it. I should have thought, men of the\n                    jury, that one who unjustly keeps in his possession the property of another,\n                    should not make complaints if he has kept it in his possession longer than is\n                    right, but should be grateful, not to us, but to fortune, that so many\n                    unavoidable delays have occurred in the interim, so that he is not brought to\n                    trial until now. Our opponents, then, men of the jury, are men of this stamp; they care nothing\n                    either for the extinction of the house of Hagnias, or for all the rest of their\n                    lawless deeds; men, who, O Zeus and the godsbut why should one\n                    mention the other things relative to them? There would be much indeed to tell\n                    of. But one thing which they have brought to pass is the most lawless and the\n                    most abominable, and most clearly proves that they care for nothing except their\n                    profit. For no sooner had Theopompus got the\n                    award of the estate of Hagnias in the manner which you have heard, than he at\n                    once gave proof that he knew well that he was in possession of what in no sense\n                    belonged to him. The thing which was of the greatest value on the farms\n                    belonging to Hagnias, and which was most admired by the neighbors and by\n                    everybody else, was the olive trees. These they dug up and rooted out, more than\n                    a thousand trees, from which a large quantity of oil was produced. These trees\n                    our opponents rooted out and sold, and received a huge sum of money. And they\n                    did this while the estate of Hagnias was still subject to adjudication in\n                    accordance with the very law which had permitted them to cite the mother of this\n                    boy here. To\n                    prove that I speak the truth in this, that they rooted up the olive trees from\n                    the farms which Hagnias left, I will produce for you as witnesses the neighbors\n                    and others whom we summoned, when we made a solemn protest against this\n                        action.Read the deposition.\n                    If now, men of\n                    the jury, it were against the dead man only that they had committed an outrage\n                    in doing this, their conduct would have been disgraceful, though in a less\n                    degree; but in reality it is against the whole city that they have committed\n                    this outrage, and they have broken your laws. You will know this, when you have\n                    heard the law.Read the law.\n                    The law is thus\n                    severe. But pray ponder in your minds, men of the jury, what you must imagine us\n                    to have suffered in the past from these men and the insolence of these men, when\n                    they have shown contempt toward you, so great a people, and have done what the\n                    laws expressly forbid their doing, in thus contemptuously laying waste the farms\n                    which Hagnias left. The law forbids anyone to root up any of these things even\n                    out of his own land inherited from his fathers. Much indeed do these men care\n                    either about obedience to your laws or the saving of the house of Hagnias from\n                    extinction! I\n                    desire, men of the jury, to speak to you in a few words about myself, and to\n                    prove to you that I have, in a very different way from theirs, shown my concern\n                    that the house of Hagnias should not become extinct. For I, too, am myself of\n                    the family of Buselus. For Callistratus married the granddaughter of Habron, the\n                    son of Buselus, being himself the son of Eubulides and grandson of Buselus; and\n                    from the granddaughter of Habron and Callistratus, the nephew of Habron, our\n                    mother was born. I myself, when I had been\n                    awarded the hand of the mother of this boy, and four sons and one daughter had\n                    been born to me, gave them, men of the jury, the following names: to the eldest\n                    I gave, as was fitting, the name of my father Sosias, and thus I gave to the\n                    eldest this name that was his due; to the son born next after him I gave the\n                    name Eubulides, which was the name of the father of this boy's mother; to the\n                    next after him I gave the name Menestheus, for Menestheus was a relative of my\n                    wife; and to the youngest I gave the name Callistratus, which was the name of my\n                    mother's father. In addition to all this, I did not give my daughter in marriage\n                    into another family, but to my own brother's son, in order that, if they had\n                    health, the children born of them should be of the same family as Hagnias.\n                        I, then, administered matters in this way,\n                    in order that the families springing from Buselus should as completely as\n                    possible be preserved. As for our opponents, let us examine them once\n                        more.And first of all read this law.\n                    How, now, could\n                    people more effectively bring a house to extinction than if, being themselves of\n                    another house, that of Stratius, they should dispossess those nearest of kin to\n                    Hagnias? Or again, if one should claim to possess the estate of Hagnias as being\n                    related by blood, when he bears a name that is not only not derived from the\n                    family of Hagnias, but not even from that of Stratius, the claimant's own\n                    ancestorno, when he has not the name of any other of all the\n                    descendants of Buselus, many as they are? Whence, then, does he get the name Macartatus? From his mother's family. For\n                    he was adopted into the family of Macartatus of Prospalta, who was his mother's\n                    brother, and he possesses that estate also. And so regardless of right is he\n                    that, when a son was born to him, he forgot to introduce him into the family of\n                    Hagnias, as a son to Hagnias, and that too while he was in possession of the\n                    estate of Hagnias, and claimed that he was related to him by male descent.\n                        This son who was born to him Macartatus\n                    has introduced by his mother's descent into the Prospaltians, and has suffered\n                    the family of Hagnias to become extinct, so far as this boy is concerned; but he\n                    alleges that his own father Theopompus was related to Hagnias. Yet the law of\n                    Solon ordains that males and the sons of males shall have precedence; but the\n                    defendant has thus lightly shown contempt both for Hagnias and for the laws, and\n                    has had his son introduced into the family of his mother. How could there be\n                    people more scornful of law or more arbitrary than these? Now this is not the\n                    only thing, men of the jury. There is a place of burial common to all those\n                    descended from Buselus it is called the burial-place of the Buselidae,\n                    a large area, enclosed, after the manner of the men of old. In this\n                    burial-place lie all the other descendants of Buselus and Hagnias and Eubulides\n                    and Polemon, and all the rest of the host of those descended from Buselus, all\n                    these hold in common this place of burial. But\n                    the father of the defendant Macartatus and the grandfather have no share in it,\n                    but they made for themselves a tomb apart, at a distance from that of the\n                    Buselidae. Do they appear to you, men of the jury, to belong in any sense to the\n                    house of Hagnias, except that they have seized and hold what does not belong to\n                    them? Whether the house of Hagnias and of Eubulides, the cousin of Hagnias, is\n                    to become extinct and have no name, has never in the least degree been an object\n                    of concern to them. I for my part, men of the jury, am defending to the full extent\n                    of my power the interest of those dead relatives, but it is not an easy task to\n                    contend against the intrigues of these men. I therefore deliver over to you this\n                    boy to be the object of your care in whatever way you may deem most just. He has\n                    been adopted into the house of Eubulides, and has been introduced to the\n                    clansmen, not mine, but those of Eubulides and Hagnias and the defendant,\n                    Macartatus. And when he was being introduced,\n                    the rest of the clansmen cast their votes secretly, but the defendant Macartatus\n                    by an open vote declared that this boy was being rightly introduced as a son to\n                    Eubulides; for he did not wish to lay his hand upon the victim or to remove it\n                    from the altar, and thus make himself responsible; nay, he even received his\n                    portion of the flesh from the hand of this boy, and took it away with him, as\n                    did the rest of the clansmen. Consider, men of\n                    the jury, that this boy is set before you as though he were the suppliant's\n                    wand, on behalf of the deceased Hagnias and Eubulides and the other descendants\n                    of Hagnias, and that they supplicate you jurymen not to allow their house to be\n                    brought to extinction by these loathsome monsters, who are of the house of\n                    Stratius, and never belonged to that of Hagnias. Do not suffer them to keep what\n                    is not their own, but compel them to give it back into the house of Hagnias for\n                    those who are his relatives.

It was incumbent upon ussince the law grants the right of\n                    succession to those nearest of kin, and we are relatives of Archiades, who\n                    originally left the estatenot to suffer his house to become extinct,\n                    and others, who had no right whatever to it, to inherit his property; while the\n                    defendant, who was neither a son by blood of the deceased nor a son adopted\n                    according to your laws, as I shall show, has thus recklessly made a false\n                    affidavit, and is seeking to rob me of the inheritance. I beg you, men of the jury, to come to the aid of my\n                    father and myself, if our pleading shall seem just, and not suffer men who are\n                    poor and without influence to be crushed by the lawless men marshalled against\n                    us. For we have come before you relying upon the truth, well content if we are\n                    permitted to obtain our legal rights; while our adversaries have from the first\n                    never ceased to rely upon intrigue and the spending of money, and very naturally\n                    in my opinion; for they readily make expenditures from funds which belong to\n                    others, and so have provided themselves with a host of people who will speak in\n                    their behalf and give false testimony. My\n                    father here  for the truth shall be told you comes into\n                    court with manifest signs that he is, as you are all aware, a poor man, and that\n                    he knows nothing of pleading in court; for he has long been a public crier in\n                    Peiraeus, and this is not only a sign of the poverty which is common to man, but\n                    also of the fact that he has no time to meddle with the law; for a man so\n                    employed has to spend the whole day in the market-place. If you bear this in\n                    mind, you will be forced to conclude that, if we did not rely upon the justice\n                    of our cause, we should never have come before you at all. With reference to\n                    matters of this nature you will gain clearer information in the course of my\n                    address, but I think I must now inform you about the affidavit and the case at\n                    issue. If, men of the jury, Leochares, basing his defence upon the affidavit\n                    itself, were going to prove that he is the lawfully born son of Archiades, there\n                    would be no need of many words, nor any need that I should trace our family line\n                    back to its origin; but since the matters sworn\n                    to in the affidavit are of a different nature, and most of the arguments of our\n                    adversaries will be devoted to proving that they were adopted and should\n                    properly inherit the estate by right of descent as lawful children, it is\n                    necessary for this reason, men of the jury, to go back a little way and instruct\n                    you regarding the pedigree; for when you understand this matter clearly, there\n                    will be no danger of your being misled by their arguments. Very well then, the case before you is one to settle\n                    the title to an inheritance. Our claim to the estate is based upon descent,\n                    theirs upon adoption. We admit here in your presence that all adoptions, if\n                    rightly made in accordance with the laws, ought to be valid. Bear in mind,\n                    therefore, the bases upon which our respective claims rest, and if they prove to\n                    you that the laws grant what they have sworn in their affidavit, adjudge the\n                    estate to them. And even if they have not the\n                    support of the laws, but it seems to you that what they say is in accordance\n                    with justice and generosity, even so we withdraw our claim. However, that you\n                    may know that, while we are by descent the nearest of kin, we do not rest our\n                    case upon this alone, but upon all the other grounds as well, I will first\n                    instruct you regarding the family itself from which the inheritance comes; for I\n                    am sure that, if you follow with clear understanding this phase of the matter at\n                    issue, you will have no difficulty in grasping any of the other facts.\n                        To go back\n                    to the beginning, men of the jury, there were born to Euthymachus, of\n                        Otryn,\n                    three sons, Meidylides and Archippus and Archiades, and a daughter whose name\n                    was Archidic. After the death of their father the brothers gave\n                    Archidic in marriage to Leostratus of  ; of the three brothers Archippus lost his life\n                    at  while\n                    serving as trierarch, and Meidylides not long afterward married Mnesimache, the\n                    daughter of Lysippus of Crioa.\n                    To him there was born a daughter,\n                    Cleitomach by name, whom he wished to give in marriage to his own\n                    brother, who was still unmarried; but since Archiades declared that he did not\n                    wish to marry, and for this reason allowed the property to remain undivided, and\n                    lived by himself in , Meidylides\n                    at length gave his daughter in marriage to Aristoteles of\n                        Pallen, my grandfather. Of them were born three\n                    sons, Aristodemus here, my father, and Habronichus, my uncle, and Meidylides,\n                    who is now dead. Our right of inheritance, based on kinship in the family to\n                    which the estate belongs, is, men of the jury, substantially this. For we are the nearest of kin to Archiades in the\n                    male line, and, as we deemed it right according to this law that we should\n                    inherit his estate, and not allow the family to be brought to extinction, we\n                    brought suit for the inheritance before the archon. Our opponents, who hold the\n                    property without right, have now filed an affidavit of objections, basing their\n                    entire claim upon adoption, but alleging also that they are near of kin.\n                        Now, with regard to this adoption, we will\n                    show you plainly later on what its character was; but with reference to blood\n                    relationship, I must prove to you that they are not nearer of kin than we. One\n                    thing is admitted, that in the matter of inheritance males and those descended\n                    from males have the precedence, for the law explicitly gives the inheritance as\n                    their due to the nearest of kin in the male line, when there are no children.\n                    Well, it is we who answer this description; for Archiades is admitted to have\n                    died without issue, and we are the nearest of kin to him in the male line.\n                        And furthermore, we are also his nearest\n                    of kin in the female line; for Meidylides was the brother of Archiades, and the\n                    daughter of Meidylides was the mother of my father, so that Archiades, for whose\n                    inheritance we are now prosecuting our claim, is uncle  their fathers\n                    having been brothers to the mother of my father, having this\n                    relationship in the male line, not in the female line. But Leostratus here is in\n                    kinship further removed, and is related to Archiades on the female side; for the\n                    mother of Leocrates, the father of the defendant, was niece to the Archiades in\n                    question and to Meidylides, as descendants of whom we claim the right to win the\n                    inheritance. First, men of the jury, to prove that our pedigree is as I have stated, the\n                    clerk shall read you the depositions, and thereafter the law itself which awards\n                    inheritances to the families and to those nearest of kin in the male line. For,\n                    I take it, these are the essential points in the case and the matters upon which\n                    you cast your vote under oath.Call the witnesses\n                    up here, please, and read the law.\n                    Matters\n                    concerning their pedigree and concerning ours, men of the jury, stand thus, and\n                    so it is right that those who have proved on the basis of the affidavits\n                    themselves that they are nearer of kin, should have the inheritance, and that\n                    the madness of the one who made the affidavit of objections should not prove\n                    stronger than your laws. For if they lay stress on the adoption, the nature of\n                    which I shall make clear to you, yet surely after the death without issue of the\n                    adopted son, when the house up to the filing of our suit had become extinct, it\n                    is right that those who are nearest of kin should receive the inheritance, and\n                    that you should give your aid, not to those citizens who are able to get up the\n                    strongest backing, but to those who are suffering wrong. If it had been in our power, after setting forth\n                    matters regarding the pedigree and the affidavit itself, to leave the platform,\n                    and to have no need of further words, since practically the most important\n                    arguments would have been advanced, we should not trouble you further. But since\n                    our opponents will not rely upon the laws, but through having forestalled us and\n                    got some control of the situation long ago, and through having entered into\n                    possession of the estate, will use these facts as proofs, and declare that they\n                    are the heirs, it is perhaps necessary to discuss these matters as well, and to\n                    prove that of all humankind our opponents are the most arbitrary. To go back to the\n                    beginning, men of the jury, Meidylides and Archiades gave their sister in\n                    marriage to Leostratus of Eleusis; and after a time from this sister of theirs,\n                    thus given in marriage, there was born Leocrates, the Iather of the defendant\n                    Leostratus; observe how distantly related he is to Archiades, regarding whom\n                    they have filed the affidavit of objections. When matters were as I have stated,\n                    Archiades did not marry, but his brother Meidylides, the grandfather of my\n                    father here, did marry. They made as yet no\n                    division of the property, but, both having enough to live on, Meidylides\n                    continued to live in the city, and Archiades made his home in Salamis. Not long\n                    afterward, when Meidylides, my father's grandfather, happened to go on a journey\n                    out of the country, Archiades fell sick, and died during the absence of\n                    Meidylides, being still unmarried. What is the proof of this? A maiden bearing\n                    an urn for water stands upon the tomb of Archiades. At this juncture Leocrates, the father of Leostratus\n                    here, on the pretext of his relationship on the female side, got himself adopted\n                    as son to Archiades, and so entered into possession of the estate, as though he\n                    had been adopted by Archiades during his lifetime. When Meidylides returned, he\n                    was incensed at what had been done, and was in a mood to enter suit against\n                    Leocrates; but under the persuasion of his relatives and their pleas that he\n                    should suffer Leocrates to remain in the family as the son by adoption of\n                    Archiades, he yielded the point,not through losing his case in court,\n                    but absolutely through being deceived by these men here and partly also through\n                    giving way to the persuasion of his relatives. After this experience Meidylides died, and Leocrates continued in possession\n                    of the estate of Archiades, and conducted himself as heir for many years, as\n                    being his adopted son; and we, on our part, inasmuch as Meidylides had made this\n                    concession, refrained from action. No long time afterwards,\n                    however,and now, men of the jury, pay close heed to what I am about\n                    to say Leocrates, who had become\n                    son by adoption to Archiades, himself returned to the Eleusinians, to whom he\n                    originally belonged, leaving Leostratus here in the family as a lawfully born\n                    son. Even then we did not as yet disturb any of the arrangements regarding the\n                    estate, but continued as before. Well now,\n                    Leostratus here, although he was an adopted son and had been left in the family\n                    of Archiades, himself returned, as his father had done, to the Eleusinians,\n                    leaving in his place a lawfully born son, and, in defiance of the laws, setting\n                    up the original adoption as valid through the lives of three persons. For how could it be other than contrary to the laws,\n                    when one, being himself an adopted son, returned to his original family leaving\n                    adopted sons in his place? That is what Leostratus has done up to this day, and\n                    by this means they think to rob us of our inheritance, making profit from the\n                    estate of Archiades, and supporting their children by it, and always returning\n                    from it to the estate of their fathers, keeping that intact, while spending the\n                    other. Nevertheless, although matters were in this condition, as I have told you, we\n                    submitted to everything. Until when? Until Leocrates, who had been left by\n                    Leostratus in the house as a son, died without issue. But since he died without\n                    issue, we, who are nearest of kin to Archiades, claim to inherit the property;\n                    and we claim that the defendant cannot, in order to rob us of what is ours, give\n                    an adopted son to the dead man who was himself adopted. For if Leocrates had himself adopted a son during his\n                    lifetime, even though the action was contrary to law, we should have made no\n                    protest; but since he had no son born to him, nor had adopted one during his\n                    lifetime, and as the law gives inheritances to the nearest of kin, how can it be\n                    other than right that we should not be robbed of this inheritance, to which we\n                    have a double title? For we are nearest of kin\n                    to Archiades, to whom the property originally belonged, and also to the adopted\n                    Leocrates; for his father, seeing that he has returned to the Eleusinians, no longer retained his legal relationship,\n                    whereas we, to whose family he had come to belong, had the closest relationship,\n                    being children of that father's first cousin. So, if you like, we claim the\n                    inheritance as kinsmen of Archiades, or, if you like it better, as kinsmen of\n                    Leocrates; for since he died without issue, no one is nearer of kin than we.\n                        So far as you are concerned, Leostratus,\n                    the family has become extinct; for you sought to maintain a relationship with\n                    the property, not with those who adopted you. After the death of Leocrates, so\n                    long as no one laid claim to the estate, you sought to get no one adopted as a\n                    son to Archiades; but now that we have come forward as kinsmen, then you get one\n                    adopted, that you may get possession of the property. And you declare that\n                    Archiades, into whose house you were adopted, had no property, yet you file an\n                    affidavit of objections against us, seeking to exclude his acknowledged kindred.\n                    If there is nothing in the estate, wherein do you suffer loss, if we inherit\n                    this nothing? But the fact is, men of the\n                    jury, that his impudence and greed are such that he thinks it is legitimate for\n                    him to return to the Eleusinians and retain the estate of his fathers, and at\n                    the same time to be master of that into which he was introduced by adoption,\n                    there being no son in the family. And all this he easily managed, for over us,\n                    who are poor men and men without influence, he has a great advantage, since he\n                    is able to spend what belongs to others. I consider, therefore, that it is your\n                    duty, men of the jury, to give aid to us who are not seeking to gain an\n                    advantage over others, but who are content if we are allowed to win our legal\n                    rights. For what are we to do, men of the\n                    jury? When the adoption has been continued through three persons, and the one\n                    last left in the family has died without issue, are we not at the last to\n                    recover what is our own? Well then, having this just claim, we brought suit for\n                    the inheritance before the archon. But this fellow Leochares here, having\n                    lightly sworn a false affidavit, thinks that he has the right to rob us of the\n                    inheritance in defiance of all the laws. First, then, to prove that what we have\n                    stated about the adoptions and the pedigree of these men is true, and that the\n                    water-bearer does stand upon the tomb of Archiades, we wish to read to you these\n                    depositions. After that we will instruct you plainly regarding the remaining\n                    matters as well, and so convict our opponents of having sworn a false\n                        affidavit.Take, please, the depositions of\n                    which I speak.\n                    Such is the\n                    real meaning of this affair, men of the jury, and such the legal rights of\n                    inheritance, plainly stated; and you have also heard what amounts to a summary\n                    of all that has been done from the start. But I consider it necessary to tell\n                    you also of what they have done since the suit for the inheritance was\n                    instituted, and the manner in which they have treated us; for in my opinion no\n                    other people have ever in an inheritance suit been dealt with in a manner so\n                    contrary to law as we have been. For when\n                    Leocrates died, and his funeral had taken place, and we went to take possession\n                    of his property, since he had died without issue and unmarried, Leostratus here\n                    ejected us, declaring that it belonged to him. Now his preventing us from\n                    performing any of the proper rites for the deceased is perhaps to be excused,\n                    seeing that he was his father, although the act was contrary to law; for it is\n                    proper that the care of the funeral should be committed to the natural father,\n                    but, next after him, also to us the members of the family to whom the deceased\n                    was related by virtue of the adoption. But\n                    after the funeral rites were finished, what law will be found to justify him,\n                    when the family was extinct, in driving us, the nearest of kin, from the estate\n                    of the deceased? Because, they will say, he was father to the dead man. Yes, but\n                    he had returned to the family of his fathers, and was no longer master of the\n                    estate over which he had left his son in charge. Otherwise what is the use of\n                    the laws? Well, after our ejectment had taken\n                    place  to omit most of the details we brought suit for the\n                    inheritance before the archon, inasmuch as the deceased had no son, as I stated,\n                    and had not adopted any according to the laws. After this, Leostratus here made\n                    a deposit for costs, as being the son of the aforesaid Archiades, not taking\n                    into account that he had returned to the Eleusinians, or that adopted children\n                    are made such, not by themselves but by those who adopt them. But the truth is, I presume his one simple idea was\n                    that he must by fair means or foul lay claim to the property of others. And\n                    first he had the audacity to go and enroll himself on the assembly list of the Otrynians, although he\n                    was an Eleusinian, and managed to put this through; then, before his name was\n                    entered on the adult register of the Otrynians, he sought to claim a share in\n                    the public benefits in flagrant defiance of law, because of his greed for gain.\n                        We, seeing what was going on, called\n                    witnesses and put a stop to it, holding the view that it was necessary that the\n                    right of inheritance should first be decided in your court before anyone should\n                    be named as the adopted son of Archiades. He was thwarted then, and convicted in\n                    the presence of many witnesses of fraudulent action, both in the matter of the\n                    list, and in the assembly for the election of the deme's officers, yet\n                    nevertheless he persisted in trying to force his way in, and by his intrigues to\n                    prove himself stronger than your laws. What is the proof of this? He got together some of the Otrynians with the\n                    demarch, and persuaded them at the opening of the adult register to inscribe his\n                    name. And after that on the occasion of the great Panathenaea at the time of the distribution, he came to get his\n                    admission fee, and when the other demesmen were receiving it, he demanded that\n                    it be given him also, and that he should be entered on the register under the\n                    name of Archiades. But when we entered a solemn protest, and all the others\n                    declared that what he was doing was an outrage, he went away without either\n                    having his name inscribed or receiving the admission fee. Now do you not think\n                    that a man, who in defiance of your decree claimed the right to receive the\n                    admission fee before his name had been inscribed on the list of the Otrynians,\n                    belonging as he did to another deme, would lay claim to an inheritance in\n                    defiance of the laws? Or when a man, before the court has rendered its decision,\n                    schemes to get advantages so unjust, can you think it reasonable to assume that\n                    he relies upon the justice of his case? For he, who fraudulently claimed the\n                    right to receive the admission fee, has now obviously practised the same design\n                    regarding the inheritance. Nay more, he even\n                    deceived the archon, when he made his deposit for costs to thwart us, and in his\n                    counter-statement declared that he was an Otrynian, when he was in fact a\n                    demesman among the Eleusinians. When, however, he failed in all these schemes,\n                    at the last election of officers the fellow got together some of the demesmen,\n                    and demanded that he be registered as the adopted son of Archiades. Again we protested that the demesmen should give\n                    their votes only when the inheritance suit should have been decided, and not\n                    before; and to this they agreed, not on their own responsibility, but out of\n                    respect for the laws; for it seemed to them an outrageous thing that a man who\n                    had made a deposit for costs in an inheritance suit, should get himself adopted\n                    as a son while the matter was still undecided; but the thing which this fellow\n                    Leostratus contrived after this is the most outrageous of all. For when he failed to\n                    get his own name inscribed, he entered his own son Leochares as an adopted son\n                    of Archiades, in defiance of all the laws, before the scrutiny of the deme had taken place. But Leochares had not yet\n                    been introduced to the clansmen of Archiades; yet when his name had been entered\n                    on the list of the deme, only then did Leostratus, by bringing influence to bear\n                    upon a certain member of the clan, get the name inscribed upon the clan\n                        register.\n                    And after that, in his affidavit before the\n                    archon he inscribed Leochares as being the lawfully born son of the man who had\n                    been dead many years pastLeochares, who had been registered with the\n                    clan only a day or two before! So it results that they both lay claim to the\n                    inheritance; for Leostratus here made the deposit for costs in the inheritance\n                    suit as being the lawfully born son of Archiades, and Leochares here has filed\n                    the affidavit, as being the lawfully born son of the same father! And in neither case is it to a living man, but to one\n                    that is dead, that each of them makes himself an adopted son! But in our\n                    opinion, men of the jury, you ought, when you shall have cast your vote\n                    concerning the present case, then, and not till then, to find from among us, who\n                    are nearest of kin, an adopted son for the deceased, in order that the family\n                    may not become extinct. First, men of the jury, to prove that Leostratus here has\n                    returned to the Eleusinians from the demesmen of Otryn, leaving a\n                    lawfully born son in the family of Archiades; and that his father at an earlier\n                    date had done this same thing; and that the son so left has died without issue;\n                    and that the one who has now sworn the affidavit was enrolled among the demesmen\n                    before he had been enrolled among the members of the clanto prove\n                    these facts the clerk shall read you the depositions of the members of the clan\n                    and of the deme; and in proof of all the other things I have mentioned which\n                    these men have done I shall produce testimony concerning each several\n                        fact.Please call the witnesses to come\n                        forward.\n                    All the facts\n                    of the case, then, you have heard, men of the jury, all that took place at the\n                    first in connection with this inheritance, and all that occurred subsequently,\n                    as soon as we commenced our suit. It remains to speak of the affidavit itself\n                    and the laws in accordance with which we claim to inherit; and furthermore, if\n                    the water holds out and we shall not be troubling you too much, to refute the\n                    arguments which our opponents are going to advance, proving to you that they are\n                    neither just nor sound. And first let the clerk read the affidavit; and I beg\n                    you to give it close attention; for it is regarding this that your votes are\n                    presently to be cast.\n                    Well, then, the\n                    defendant has sworn, as you have heard,  that the inheritance of\n                    Archiades is not open to litigation, since he has children lawfully born and\n                    rightfully established according to the statute. Let us, then,\n                    inquire if there are any, or if the defendant has sworn to what is false. The\n                    aforesaid Archiades, whose estate is in question, adopted as his son the\n                    grandfather of the one who has now sworn this affidavit; he, leaving a lawfully\n                    born son, Leostratus, the father of the defendant, returned to the Eleusinians.\n                        After this, Leostratus here himself\n                    returned to the house of his fathers, leaving a son in the adoptive house; and\n                    the son whom he left, and who was the last of all the adopted children, has died\n                    without issue, so that the house thereby becomes extinct and the inheritance has\n                    reverted again to those originally nearest of kin. How, then, could Archiades still have any sons, as the affidavit\n                    claims, when it is admitted that his adopted children returned to their original\n                    family and the last one left has died without issue? It follows, then, of\n                    necessity that the family is extinct. But when the family is extinct, there\n                    cannot be lawfully born sons still living. The fellow, then, has sworn that\n                    non-existent persons exist, and has written in the affidavit  since\n                    he has children, alleging that he himself is one of them. But surely, when he says  lawfully born\n                    and rightfully established according to the statute, he is quibbling\n                    and defying the laws. For the  lawfully born exists, when\n                    it is born of the body; and the law bears testimony to this, when it says,\n                     Lawfully born are children of a woman whom her father or brother or\n                    grandfather has given in marriage. But  rightfully\n                    established the lawgiver understood of adoptions, considering that\n                    when a man, being childless and master of his property, adopts a son, this\n                    action ought to be rightful. Well, our opponent says that Archiades had no son\n                    of the body, but in the affidavit he has sworn to the words  since\n                    there are lawfully born children, thus making a sworn statement that\n                    is contrary to the truth. He admits that he is\n                    an adopted son, yet it is manifest that he was not adopted by the dead man\n                    himself; so how can you claim that this status is  rightfilly\n                    established according to the statute ? Because, he will say, he was\n                    registered as the son of Archiades. Yes, by the arbitrary act of these men, and\n                    that only the other day, when the suit for the estate had already been\n                    instituted. Surely it is not right for a man to regard as evidence his own\n                    illegal act. For is it not an outrageous\n                    thing, men of tlie jury, that he should stateas he will presently in\n                    his speechthat he is an adopted son, while in his affidavit he did\n                    not dare to write this? Or that, while in the affidavit the protest is made as\n                    though for a son of the body, the speech that will presently be made will be on\n                    behalf of an adopted son? If they are going to make their defence conflict with\n                    the affidavit, surely either what they say, or what they swore, is false. It was\n                    with good reason that they did not add to the affidavit mention of the adoption,\n                    for in that case they would have had to add the words  adopted by\n                    so-and-so. But Archiades never did adopt them; they adopted\n                    themselves, in order to rob us of the inheritance. Now is not their next proceeding\n                    absurd as well as outrageous?that Leostratus here should have made\n                    his deposit for costs in the inheritance suit before the archon, as being the\n                    son of Archiades  while he was an Eleusinian, and Archiades of the\n                    deme Otryn , but that someone else should have sworn the\n                    affidavit, as you see for yourselves, alleging that he, too, was a son of\n                    Archiades? To which of the two should you pay attention, as telling the truth?\n                        This very thing is the strongest proof of\n                    the falsehood of the affidavitthat it is not the same person who\n                    makes the claim about the same matter. And this is not strange for, I fancy,\n                    when Leostratus here made his deposit in the inheritance suit against us, the\n                    one who has now sworn the affidavit had not yet registered himself as a member\n                    of the deme. We should therefore be most cruelly treated if you should believe\n                    an affidavit made after the suit was begun. Nay more, Leochares has in the affidavit\n                    sworn to facts actually older than himself. For how could a person who was not\n                    yet a member of the house of Archiades when this suit for the inheritance was\n                    instituted, know anything about these matters? Moreover, if he had sworn it of\n                    himself alone, there would have been some sense in his action; he would have\n                    written what was false, but nevertheless his statement would have concerned one\n                    of an age to know. But as it is, he has written that the aforesaid Archiades had\n                    lawfully born sons, meaning, of course, his own father and the one made such by\n                    the original adoption, not taking cognizance of the fact that they had returned\n                    to their original family. It follows, then, of necessity that he has sworn to\n                    events older than himself, and not to things which have happened in his own day.\n                    Are you, then, to credit one who has dared a thing like that, as though he were\n                    speaking the truth? Ah, but he will say that\n                    he has heard from his father the facts to which he has sworn. But the law does\n                    not admit hearsay evidence, save in the case of deceased persons; whereas this\n                    fellow has dared to swear to acts done by his father, while that father is still\n                    alive. Then again, why did Leostratus here inscribe on the affidavit the name,\n                    not of himself, but of the defendant? For the older facts should have been sworn\n                    to by the older man. It was, he might say, because I have had this youth adopted\n                    as son to Archiades. Well then, you who had\n                    him adopted and concocted the whole affair ought to have rendered an account of\n                    it, and made yourself responsible for what you have done. You ought absolutely\n                    to have done so. But you evaded this, and wrote over the affidavit the name of\n                    your son here, who knew nothing of the matter. You see, then, men of the jury,\n                    that the statements in the affidavit are false, and they are admitted by these\n                    men themselves to be so. Why, it would even be right for you to refuse to listen\n                    to this man Leostratus, when he presently undertakes to make statements to which\n                    he did not venture to swear in the affidavit. Furthermore, that affidavits of objection\n                    are of all forms of trial the most unjust, and that those having recourse to\n                    them are most deserving of your resentment, one can see very clearly from the\n                    following facts. In the first place, they are not necessary as the other forms\n                    of procedure are, but they are instituted by the will and desire of the one\n                    swearing to them. If\n                    in the matter of disputed claims there is no other way of getting a judgement\n                    than by such an affidavit, it is perhaps necessary to make one. But, if it is possible without an affidavit of\n                    objections to obtain a hearing before all tribunals, is not the use of one a\n                    mark of recklessness and utter desperation? For the lawgiver did not make it\n                    obligatory on the contending parties, but granted them the privilege of putting\n                    in such an affidavit, if they chose, as though he were testing the character of\n                    each one of us, to see how we stand with reference to a reckless procedure.\n                    Further, if it rested with those who file\n                    these affidavits, there would be neither courts of justice nor trials; for the\n                    nature of affidavits of objections is to bIock all these things and to prevent\n                    all cases from being brought into the court-roomat least so far as\n                    the will of the one swearing the affidavit goes. Therefore I think we should\n                    regard such people as the common enemies of all men, and that they should never\n                    receive any indulgence when they are on trial before you; for each one of them\n                    comes into court, not under compulsion, but having chosen to incur the risk of\n                    the oath. Well\n                    then, that the affidavit is false, you have learned pretty definitely from the\n                    statements contained in it and from the arguments which you have heard. But that\n                    the laws also give us this inheritance as our right, men of the jury, I wish to\n                    prove in a few wordsnot as though this had not been made clear to you\n                    in what I said at the outset, but that you may the better bear in mind the\n                    justice of our case, and so meet the false statements of our opponents.\n                        To sum up\n                    the matter briefly, we, since we are the nearest of kin in the male line to\n                    Archiades, to whom this estate belonged, and since of the persons whom he\n                    adopted some have gone back to the family of their fathers, and the one last\n                    left had died without issue,in these circumstances, we, I say, claim\n                    to inherit. We are not depriving Leostratus of\n                    any property  for these men hold what is their own , but we\n                    claim the estate left by Archiades, which is ours according to the laws. For the\n                    law, men of the jury, ordains that males and the sons of males should have\n                    precedence; and such we are. Archiades had no children, and we are the ones\n                    nearest of kin to him. Further, it is surely\n                    not just that an adopted son should bring other sons into a family by adoption;\n                    he may leave in it children born to him, but in default of these he must restore\n                    the inheritance to those related by blood. That is what the laws\n                        ordain.For is it not plain that each one of\n                    you is excluded from the right of inheritance by direct descent, if this licence\n                    be granted to children by adoption? For you see that most people who adopt\n                    children do so through being cajoled by flattery and often in a spirit of\n                    contentiousness caused by family quarrels. But if an adopted son is to be\n                    permitted in defiance of the law to adopt whomsoever he pleases, inheritances\n                    will never be given to blood-relations. It was\n                    to guard against this that the lawgiver forbade a person who was himself adopted\n                    to create a son by adoption. In what manner did he declare his view regarding\n                    this? When he says  a man may return to his own family, leaving\n                    behind him a lawfully born son he makes it plain, I take it, that it\n                    is not lawful for him to adopt; for it is impossible for a man to leave behind\n                    him a lawfully born son, unless he have a son born of his body. But you,\n                    Leostratus, claim the right to bring an adopted son into the inheritance of the\n                    dead man, who had himself been adopted into our family, just as though you were\n                    taking possession of your own property, and not that which the law declares\n                    shall be given to the nearest of kin. For ourselves, men of the jury, if the\n                    deceased had adopted anyone, even though the law does not allow it, we should\n                    have submitted; or, if he had left a will, we should also have been ready to\n                    abide by that; for from the beginning this has been our position; we made no\n                    objection to their holding the property and returning to their original family\n                    in whatever manner they pleased. Now, however,\n                    that the affair has at length been exposed both by these men themselves and by\n                    the laws, we hold that it is right for us to inherit the estate of Archiades,\n                    and that the son to be adopted should come from us who have not been adopted\n                    before, and not from them. For it was just, in my opinion, that the lawgiver, as\n                    he laid upon the nearest of kin the duty of relieving the misfortunes of their\n                    relatives, and of giving in marriage their women-folk, so also has given to\n                    these same people as their due the right of inheriting and of sharing in the\n                    good things. But that which is the most\n                    significant thing, and the thing best known to you, is this: the law of Solon\n                    does not allow an adopted son even to dispose by will of the property in the\n                    family into which he comes by adoption. And there is good reason for this, in my\n                    view; for a person who comes by legal adoption into possession of the property\n                    of another, ought not to deal with it as if it were his own private estate. No,\n                    he should act consistently with the laws, and do in each particular what the\n                    laws prescribe. All those who had\n                    not been adopted, says the lawgiver, at the time when Solon entered upon office,\n                    may bequeath their property by will, as they see fit, thus indicating\n                    that those who were adopted might not so dispose of theirs, but that they might\n                    return to their families in their lifetime, leaving a lawfully born son in their\n                    place; otherwise, in case of death, they must give back the property to those\n                    who from the first were relatives of the adoptive father."}}, {"@type": "speech", "@n": "45", "head": "Apollodorus Against Stephanus 1", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "13"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "14"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "15"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "16"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "17"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "18"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "19"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "20"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "21"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "22"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "23"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "24"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "25"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "26"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "27"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "28"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "29"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "30"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "31"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "32"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "33"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "34"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "35"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "36"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "37"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "38"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "39"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "40"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "41"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "42"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "43"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "44"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "45"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "46"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "47"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "48"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "49"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "50"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "51"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "52"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "53"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "54"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "55"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "56"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "57"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "58"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "59"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "60"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "61"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "62"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "63"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "64"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "65"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "66"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "67"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "68"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "69"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "70"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "71"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "72"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "73"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "74"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "75"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "76"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "77"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "78"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "79"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "80"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "81"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "82"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "83"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "84"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "85"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "86"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "87"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "88"}], "note": [{"@resp": "Loeb", "@anchored": "yes", "bibl": {"@n": "Aesch.

I beg and beseech and implore you all, in the\n                    first place to give me a favorable hearing for it is a great thing for\n                    those who have met with misfortune, as I have done, to be able to tell others of\n                    what they have suffered, and to find in you listeners who are kindly\n                        disposed; and in the second place, if I shall seem to you to be the\n                    victim of wrongdoing, to render me the aid which is my due. I shall prove to you that this man Stephanus has both\n                    given false testimony, and has done this from a base desire for gain, and that\n                    he is convicted out of his own lips; so transparent is the case from every point\n                    of view. And I shall endeavor to relate to you in the fewest possible words all\n                    that has taken place between Phormio and myself from the first; and after\n                    hearing this you will be convinced both of the villainy of Phormio and that\n                    these men have borne false testimony. As for myself, men of the jury, a large\n                    property was left me by my father, and this was in the possession of Phormio,\n                    who furthermore had married my mother while I was out of the country on public\n                    business, serving as your trierarch. How he managed it, perhaps it is\n                    not proper for a son fully to explain about his mother. When I\n                    returned and learned of this and saw what had been done, although I was greatly\n                    incensed and took it much to heart, I was\n                    unable to bring a private action for there were no actions at that\n                    time, since you put off all such matters because of the war, but I indicted\n                    him before the Thesmothetae on the charge of outrage. However, time passed and the\n                    indictment was evaded seeing that actions were not being\n                    held, and moreover children were born by my mother to Phormio, and\n                    after this for the whole truth shall be told you, men of the\n                    jury, many kindly overtures were made on the part of my mother, and\n                    pleas on behalf of this man Phormio, and many overtures on the part of Phormio\n                    himself that were both moderate and humble in their terms. However, to make the story brief, men of Athens, he\n                    would not do one of the things to which he had agreed, and tried to withhold\n                    from me the money which he held as capital in the bank; so then I was compelled\n                    to enter suit against him at the earliest opportunity. Phormio on his part,\n                    seeing that everything would be brought to light, and that he would be proved to\n                    have acted toward me as the basest of humankind, contrived and concocted this\n                    plot in furtherance of which the defendant Stephanus gave this false testimony\n                    against me. In the first place, he entered a special plea in the suit in which\n                    he was defendant, claiming that the suit was not admissible; and then he\n                    produced false witnesses who stated that I had given him a release from my\n                    claims, and who deposed to a forged lease and to a will which never existed.\n                        He had the advantage over me in being the\n                    first speaker, because this was a special plea and the case was not coming to\n                    trial upon the real issue, and by reading these documents and making other false\n                    statements which he thought would favor his case, he made such an impression on\n                    the jury that they refused to hear a single word from me. I was fined one-sixth\n                    of the amount claimed, was denied the right of a hearing, and was treated with such\n                    contumely as I doubt if any other man ever was, and I went from the court, men\n                    of Athens, taking the matter bitterly and grievously to heart. Upon going over it in my own mind, however, I see that\n                    there was abundant excuse for those who gave that verdict for I do not\n                    know what other vote I could myself have given, if I had known nothing of the\n                    facts and had heard the testimony, but that our anger should fall upon\n                    these men who by giving false testimony were responsible for this result. Of the\n                    others who have given testimony I shall speak when I proceed against them, but\n                    regarding the testimony of the defendant Stephanus I shall try to instruct you\n                    at once. Take\n                    the deposition itself, and read it, please, that from its very language I may\n                    prove my point.Read; and do you check the\n                        water.\n                    You have heard\n                    the deposition, men of the jury, and I think that even if you have noticed\n                    nothing else, this at least must have seemed strange to you, that it begins with\n                    a challenge and ends with a will. However, I on my part, count it right, when I\n                    shall have shown what may be called the main substance of the testimony to be\n                    false, then, and not till then, to say something also about matters of that\n                    sort. Well, then, it is deposed by them that\n                    Phormio challenged me to open the will which Amphias,\n                    brotherinlaw of Cephisophon, submitted to the arbitrator\n                    Teisias; and that I refused to open it; and that the will to which they\n                    themselves deposed was a copy of that original; and then follows a copy of the\n                    will. Now as to whether Phormio tendered me\n                    this challenge or not, and whether the will is genuine or spurious I say nothing\n                    as yet; I will discuss these matters before you presently; but I will take up\n                    the testimony they have given, that I refused to open the document. I would have\n                    you look at the matter in this waywhat reason would anyone have had\n                    for refusing to open it? In order, one may say, that the will might not be shown\n                    to the jury. Well and good. If they had not\n                    deposed to the will as well as to the challenge, there would have been some\n                    reason in my refusing to open the document; but since they deposed to both, and\n                    the jurymen were going to hear the will in any case, what advantage was there\n                    for me in refusing? None, assuredly. Quite the contrary, men of Athens; even if\n                    these men had tendered no challenge, but had merely talked of the matter, and\n                    someone had delivered a document to them as a will, it would have been my business to tender the challenge and to order\n                    them to open it, in order that, if the contents differed from the statements\n                    which these men had made in their deposition, I might have called a number of\n                    the bystanders as witnesses, and have used this fact as a proof that the rest of\n                    their story too was a fabrication; but, if the contents were the same, I might\n                    have required the one presenting it to give evidence himself. If he consented, I\n                    should have had a responsible witness, and, if he refused, this very fact again\n                    would have been a convincing proof for me that the affair had been concocted.\n                    And in the former case the result would have been that I had one person with\n                    whom to deal, whereas according to the depositions of these men I have many. Is\n                    there anyone among you who would have chosen the latter course? I think not one\n                    of you would have. Well then, you ought not to\n                    believe it of anyone else either. For, men of Athens, in all courses of action\n                    which involve anger or some getting of gain or exasperation or a spirit of\n                    jealousy, different persons will act in different ways in accordance with their\n                    several dispositions; but in all cases where none of these things is involved,\n                    but merely a calm calculation of one's own interest, who would be so senseless\n                    as to dismiss what would help him and do what would make it more difficult for\n                    him to win his case? Yet a course of action which is neither natural nor\n                    reasonable, which, in short, no human being would have undertakenthis\n                    these witnesses have attributed to me. Moreover, it is not only from what they\n                    have stated in their deposition regarding my refusal to open the document that\n                    one can tell that they are lying, but also from the fact that they have deposed\n                    at one and the same time both to a challenge and to a will. For I think you are\n                    all aware that challenges were devised for all transactions which it is\n                    impossible to bring before you; for instance,\n                    a man may not be put to torture in your presencefor this it is\n                    necessary that there be a challenge; again, if anything has been transacted and\n                    has taken place somewhere out of the country, it is necessary that for this too\n                    there should be a challenge to go by sea or land to the place where the thing\n                    was done; and so for other things of that sort. But in cases where it is\n                    possible to produce the things themselves before your eyes, what could be\n                    simpler than to produce them publicly? Well,\n                    my father died at Athens, the arbitration took place in the Painted Stoa, and these men have\n                    deposed that Amphias produced the document before the arbitrator. Then, if it\n                    was genuine, the document ought to have been put into the box, and the one producing it should have so testified, in\n                    order that the jurymen might have reached a decision in accordance with the\n                    truth and after an inspection of the seals; and I, on my part, if anyone was\n                    wronging me, might have proceeded against him. But, as it is, no one person has taken the whole matter upon himself or given\n                    straightforward testimony, as one would do in testifying to the truth, but each\n                    has deposed to a part of the story, fancying that he is very clever and that for\n                    this reason he will escape punishment,one of them deposing that he\n                    holds a document on which is written the will of Pasio;\n                    another that, being sent by the former person, he produced this document, but\n                    had no knowledge as to whether it was genuine or spurious. These men, who are here in court, using the challenge\n                    as a screen, deposed to a will in such a way that the jurymen believed this will\n                    to be my father's, and I was debarred from obtaining a hearing regarding my\n                    wrongs, but in such a way also that they on their part would most clearly be\n                    convicted of having given false testimony. And yet this was the very opposite of\n                    what they intended.However, that you may know\n                    that I am speaking the truth in this, take the deposition of Cephisophon.\n                    It was a simple\n                    thing, men of the jury, for the one who gave this testimony to add\n                    and this is the document which the deponent exhibits, and\n                    to put the document into the box. But, I presume, he thought that this falsehood\n                    would deserve your indignation, and that you would punish him for it, whereas to\n                    testify that a document had been bequeathed to him was a trifling matter and one\n                    of no consequence. And yet it is this very thing that makes the whole matter\n                    clear, and proves that they have concocted it. For if the inscription on the will had been the property of Pasio\n                    and Phormio or in the matter of Phormio, or\n                    something of that sort, he would naturally have kept it for him; but if, as he\n                    has testified, the inscription was the will of Pasio, I\n                    should certainly have appropriated it, knowing that I was about to go to law,\n                    and knowing further that, if its contents were as represented, it was\n                    prejudicial to my interests; for I was the heir, and if the will was my\n                    father's, it belonged to me, as did also all the rest of my father's estate.\n                        Well then, by its having been produced to\n                    Phormio, by its having been inscribed the will of Pasio,\n                    and yet ignored by me, it is proved that the will is a forgery and that the\n                    testimony of Cephisophon is false. But no more of Cephisophon; it is not with\n                    him that I have to do at present, and he has given no testimony as to the\n                    contents of the will. And yet, men of Athens,\n                    I would have you consider how strong a proof this also is that these men have\n                    given false testimony. For when the witness who stated that he had the document\n                    in his own possession did not dare to say that the one produced by Phormio was a\n                    copy of the one in his own keeping; and when these men cannot state that they\n                    were present in the first instance or that they saw the document opened before\n                    the arbitrator, but have themselves actually deposed that I refused to open it,\n                    to have testified now that the one is a copy of the other, is not this to have\n                    accused themselves of falsifying? More than all this, men of Athens, any man by examining\n                    the wording of the deposition can see that it is nothing but a contrivance of\n                    theirs to the end that rightly or wrongly it may appear that my father made this\n                        will.But take the deposition itself, and\n                    read, stopping wherever I bid you, that from its own wording I may prove my\n                        point.\n                    Stop reading. Bear in mind that the words are\n                    of the will of Pasio. Now persons who wished to bear\n                    witness to the truthassuming that it is absolutely established that\n                    the challenge was tendered, which it was notought to have given their\n                    testimony in the following way.Read the\n                    deposition again from the beginning.We do depose; for we were present. Read on.This,\n                    too, they might properly have stated, assuming that he really tendered the\n                        challenge.\n                    Stop right\n                    there. There is not a person in the world, I presume, who would have proceeded\n                    to give this testimony, unless he had been present when my father drew up the\n                    will. Instead, he would have said at once, How do we know if there is\n                    any will of Pasio's?and he would have demanded that\n                    Phormio write, as in the beginning of the challenge: If I declared\n                    that the document was not a copy of the will which Phormio stated that Pasio had\n                    left,not of the will of Pasio. For\n                    this was to testify that there was a will which was their\n                    intention, the other that Phormio said that there was. And, I take it,\n                    there is a world of difference between a thing's being so, and Phormio's saying\n                    that it is. So,\n                    in order that you may know how many and how important objects were to be secured\n                    by the fabrication of the will, listen for a moment. The first, men of Athens,\n                    was this, that Phormio should escape paying the penalty for corrupting one whom\n                    it is not proper for me to name, but whom you know of yourselves, even if I do\n                    not name her; next, that he might get possession\n                    of my father's property which was in my mother's keeping; and in addition to\n                    this, that he might become master of everything else which belonged to us. That\n                    this is so, you will be convinced when you hear the will. For it will be found,\n                    not like that of a father writing in the interest of his sons, but like that of\n                    a slave who has shamefully misused what belonged to his master, and who is\n                    seeking how he may escape punishment. Read them the will itself, to which these\n                    men have deposed along with the challenge; and do you mark well what I\n                        say.You have heard,\n                    men of Athens, the large amount of the dowry,a talent from\n                    Peparethus, a talent from Athens, a lodging-house worth a hundred minae, female\n                    slaves and jewelry, and all else that she has in her possessionI give\n                    it all, says the will; and by this clause he precludes us even from searching\n                    for any of the property that was left. Now let me show you the lease under which\n                    Phormio had taken the bank from my father; for from this also, spurious though\n                    it is, you will see that the will is fabrication through and through. I will set\n                    forth for you, not a different lease, but the one which Phormio produced, in\n                    which there is an added clause setting down my father as owing Phorniio eleven\n                    talents on the deposits. This had, I think,\n                    the following purpose. Of the effects in the house he made himself master by the\n                    will, on the ground that they had been given as a dowry with my mother, as you\n                    have just heard; but the money in the bank, about which everybody knew, and\n                    which could not be hidden, he got into his hands by representing that our father\n                    owed it, so that whatever sums he might be proved to have in his possession he\n                    might claim to have received in payment. You have perhaps imagined, because he\n                        solecizes in his speech, that he is a barbarian and a\n                    man readily to be despised. The fellow is indeed a barbarian in that he hates\n                    those whom he ought to honor; but in villainy and in bringing matters to\n                        ruin he is second to none. Take the lease and read\n                    itthe lease which they put in, as they did the will, by means of a\n                        challenge.\n                    This, men of\n                    the jury, is the agreement which Phormio produced, alleging that he had leased\n                    the bank upon these terms. You learn from hearing it read that Phormio, over and\n                    above the daily expenditure, was to pay as rent two talents and forty minae each\n                    year, and that it was not to be permitted him to carry on a banking business,\n                    unless he obtained our consent; and there is added as a final statement,\n                    Pasio owes eleven talents upon the deposits. Now, is there any man who would have submitted to the\n                    payment of so large a rental for the counter, the site, and the books? And is\n                    there any man who would have entrusted the rest of the assets to a man thanks to\n                    whom the bank had incurred so great a liability? For, if there was a shortage of so large an amount, it\n                    was incurred while Phormio was manager. For you all know that, while my father\n                    was engaged in the banking business, Phormio sat at the counter and was his\n                    manager; so that he ought rather to be in the mill than to become master of the rest of the property.\n                        However, I pass over this and all else\n                    that I might find to say about the eleven talents, to show that my father did\n                    not owe them but that Phormio secretly appropriated them.But let me remind you of the purpose for which I read the\n                    lease, namely, to prove that the will is spurious. For it stands written in the\n                    lease that it shall not be lawful for Phormio to engage in banking business,\n                    unless he obtains our consent. This clause absolutely proves the will to be\n                    spurious. For what man, who had taken precautions that the profits which Phormio\n                    might make by banking should accrue to his own children and not to Phormio\n                    himself, and to secure this end had stipulated that it should not be permitted\n                    him to engage in banking for himself, lest his interests might be separated from\n                    ourswhat man, I ask, in these circumstances would have provided that\n                    Phormio should get possession of what he had himself won by his labor and left\n                    in his house? And would he have begrudged him\n                    the banking business, in which he might have given him a share without disgrace,\n                    and yet have given him his wife, a bequest disgraceful above all others? Yes,\n                    after receiving from you the gift of citizenship, he gave his wife if\n                    indeed he gave her as a slave giving to his master, and not, on the\n                    contrary, as a master to a slave, and he added such a dowry as no man in Athens\n                    was ever known to give.\n                    And yet, to have been honored with the hand of\n                    his mistress was of itself enough to make this fellow content, whereas in my\n                    father's case, even if he received as much money as these people allege that he\n                    gave, it was not reasonable for him to make this arrangement.\n                    Nevertheless, to things which are proved to be false by the probabilities, the\n                    dates and the facts, to these this man Stephanus has not hesitated to depose.\n                        Then he\n                    goes about, saying that Nicocles testified that he had served as guardian under\n                    the will, and Pasicles that he had lived as ward under the will. But for my part\n                    I hold that these very facts are proofs that neither these witnesses nor those\n                    have testified to the truth. For a person who testifies that he served as\n                    guardian under a will should certainly know what the nature of the will was, and\n                    a person who testifies that he lived as ward under a will should certainly know\n                    what the nature of the will was. Why in the\n                    world, then, Stephanus, did you people depose to the will under the form of a\n                    challenge, instead of leaving the matter to them? If they on their part shall\n                    declare that they do not know the contents of the will, how is it possible for\n                    you to know them, you who have never in any way been connected with the matter?\n                    Why, pray, is it that one group of witnesses testified to these facts, and\n                    another group to those? It is as I have already told you: they divided the\n                    fraud. The one so testifying saw no danger in deposing that he served as\n                    guardian under the will, or that he lived as ward under the will, each one of them omitting to state what had been\n                    written in the will by Phormio,no danger in deposing that one's\n                    father had left him a document with the word will written\n                    on it, or anything of that sort. But to testify to the existence of a will in\n                    which were involved the theft of such vast sums, the corruption of a lady, the\n                    marriage of a mistress with her slave, matters which entailed such shame and\n                    disgracenobody was ready to do this save these men who got up the\n                    challenge; and from them it is right to exact the penalty for the whole of this\n                    villainous fraud. Now, men of Athens, that it may be made clear to you that this\n                    fellow Stephanus has given false testimonymade clear not merely by my\n                    accusations and proofs, but also by the acts of the person who brought him\n                    forward as a witnessI wish to tell you what that person has done. As\n                    I said at the beginning of my speech, I shall show that they are their own\n                    accusers. In the suit in which this testimony was given, Phormio entered a\n                    special plea to estop me on the ground that the suit was not admissible,\n                    alleging that I had released him from all claims. Now I myself know that this is false, and I shall prove it so when I\n                    proceed against those who gave this testimony; but Stephanus is not at liberty\n                    to say it is false. If, then, you should believe in the genuineness of the\n                    release, this, more than anything else, would prove that the fellow has given\n                    false testimony, and has deposed to a will that is forged. For who would be so\n                    senseless as to give a release in the presence of witnesses, that his discharge\n                    might be binding, and yet to suffer the articles of agreement, the will, and the\n                    other documents regarding which he gave the release, to remain under seal as\n                    evidence against himself? The special plea,\n                    therefore, contradicts all the evidence, and the lease which I just now read to\n                    you contradicts this will; not one of their acts is either reasonable or\n                    straightforward or consistent with itself. In this manner their whole story is\n                    shown to be a fiction and a fraud. That the statements in the deposition are true I hold\n                    that neither Stephanus himself nor anyone else in his behalf will be able to\n                    prove. I hear, however, that he is prepared to make some such statement as this,\n                    that he is responsible for a challenge, not for a deposition, and that he should\n                    be held to account, not for everything written in it, but for two things\n                    onlywhether Phormio tendered me this challenge or not, and whether I\n                    refused it; these matters and no more, he will say, were included in his\n                    deposition; as for the rest, Phormio covered them in his challenge, but whether\n                    they were true or not it was not the business of the witness to inquire.\n                        In answer to this argument and to the\n                    man's impudence it is better that I say a few words to you in advance, that you\n                    be not taken at unawares and misled. In the first place, when he tries to bring\n                    forward the argument that he is not responsible for the entire content of the\n                    deposition, bear in mind that the reason why the law requires people to give\n                    evidence in written form is that it may not be open to them to strike out any\n                    part of what has been written, or add anything to it. He should at the time have\n                    demanded the erasure of the statements to which he will now deny having deposed,\n                    and not try now to brazen it out, while they stand in the document. Moreover, consider this too, whether you would suffer\n                    me in your presence to take the document and add to it. Of course you would not.\n                    Well, then, neither is it fitting to suffer him to strike out any of its\n                    contents. For who will ever be convicted of giving false testimony, if he is to\n                    depose to what he pleases, and be accountable only for what he pleases? No, the\n                    law does not thus make a distinction in these matters, and you ought not to\n                    listen to such a thing either. The straightforward and honest course is this:\n                    What stands written? To what have you deposed? Show that this is\n                    true. For you have written in your plea in answer to the complaint these words,\n                    'I have given true testiniony in testifying to what is contained in the\n                    deposition'not 'to this or that in the deposition.'\n                        To prove\n                    that this is so, take, please, the plea itself. Read it.This is the plea which the defendant himself has\n                    entered. You must keep it in mind, and not regard the deceitful language which\n                    will soon be addressed to you as being more worthy of credence than the laws and\n                    what the defendant has written in his own plea. I learn that they are going to speak about\n                    my original suit and to denounce it as baseless and malicious. But I on my part\n                    have already mentioned to you and explained in detail the manner in which\n                    Phormio concocted the lease, in order to get into his possession the\n                    banking-stock, and I should be unable to speak of these other matters and at the\n                    same time convict these men of giving false testimony; for the amount of water\n                    allotted me is not sufficient. And that you\n                    yourselves could not in fairness be willing to listen to them in regard to these\n                    matters you will see at once, if you reflect that it is no difficult matter to\n                    speak now about subjects concerning which no charge is made, just as it was no\n                    difficult matter for Phormio to get himself acquitted by reading false\n                    depositions. However, no man would say that either of these courses is right,\n                    but that course rather which I am about to propose. Listen, and judge. I demand that they do not now seek for the proofs\n                    regarding my charges, proofs which should have been mentioned at the former\n                    trial, but of which they deprived me; but that they prove that the testimony by\n                    which they deprived me of them was true. If, when I bring in my suit, they are\n                    to demand that I refute their testimony, and, when I proceed against that, they\n                    are to bid me speak regarding my original charges, what they propose will be\n                    neither right nor in your interest. For you\n                    have sworn to give a verdict, not in regard to matters upon which the defendant\n                    asks your decision, but in regard to those only which are raised by the\n                    prosecution. The cause of action must be made clear by the complaint of the\n                    prosecutor, and this in my case is a suit against this man for false testimony.\n                    Let him not, then, leave this and talk about matters regarding which I am not\n                    suing him; and do you, if he is so shameless, refuse to permit it. I imagine that, having\n                    no just argument to advance on any point, he will have recourse to this defence\n                    alsothat it is absurd for me, after having been worsted in the case\n                    of the special plea, to sue those who gave evidence of a will; and he will\n                    maintain that the jurymen in that trial were led to vote in favor of Phormio, by\n                    the evidence of those who testified to the release rather than by that of those\n                    who testified to the will. But, men of Athens, I think you all know that it is\n                    your habit to examine the facts no less closely than the pleas which men make\n                    regarding them; and these men, by giving false testimony against me regarding\n                    the facts themselves, weakened my arguments on the special plea. However, besides this, it is absurd, when all have\n                    given false evidence, to demonstrate who did the greatest amount of harm,\n                    instead of making each one prove that he has himself testified to the truth. It\n                    is not by proving that another has done more outrageous things than himself that\n                    a witness is to be let off, but by showing that he has himself given testimony\n                    that is true. Now, men of Athens, let me show you the thing for which more than anything\n                    else this fellow Stephanus deserves to be put to death. It is an awful thing to\n                    bear false witness against anyone whomsoever, but it is a thing more awful by\n                    far, and more deserving of indignation, to bear false witness against those of\n                    your own blood; for a man of that stamp violates, not the written laws alone,\n                    but also the ties of natural relationship. This, then, Stephanus shall be proved\n                    to have done. For his mother and the father of\n                    my wife are a brother and sister, so that my wife is his first cousin, and the\n                    children born to her and to me are his cousin's children. Do you think, then,\n                    that this man, if he saw his female relatives driven by want to shameful\n                    actions, would give them in marriage and add marriage portions out of his own\n                    resourcesa thing which many a man has done ere nowwhen he\n                    has chosen to give false testimony in order to prevent their getting what\n                    belongs to them, and has counted the wealth of Phormio of higher worth than the\n                    strong ties of kinship? However, to prove that I am telling the truth in this, take the\n                    deposition of Deinias and read it; and call Deinias.\n                    Deinias, men of\n                    the jury, is very like Stephanus, is he not?Deinias, who on account\n                    of his relationship, refuses to testify against the defendant even to what is\n                    true, and on behalf of his daughter and his daughter's children, and me, his\n                        son-in-law! Not so\n                    Stephanus here. He did not hesitate to give false testimony against us; even\n                    respect for his own mother, if for no one else, did not keep him from bringing\n                    the extremest poverty upon those who through her were his relatives. I wish now, men of the\n                    jury, to tell you of the most a outrageous thing which has been done to\n                    me,a thing which more than anything else overwhelmed me with dismay\n                    in the course of the trial; for you will thus see even more clearly the fellow's\n                    baseness, and I, by venting before you my grief for what has happened, shall\n                    find, as it were, a sort of relief. The deposition, which I thought was there,\n                    and which afforded the strongest evidence in support of my case, I did not find\n                    in the box. At the time, dismayed by this\n                    misfortune, I could imagine nothing else than that the magistrate had wronged me\n                    and tampered with the box. Now, however, from what I have since learned, I find\n                    that the defendant Stephanus had filched the document away in the very presence\n                    of the arbitrator, when I had got up to put a witness on his oath. And to prove\n                    that I am speaking the truth in this, depositions shall first be offered you\n                    from those who were present at the time and saw it; for I do not think they will\n                    choose to take an oath of disclaimer. But if\n                    they are shameless enough to do this the clerk shall read you a challenge by\n                    which you will catch them in the very act of perjury, and will know all the same\n                    that this man did steal the deposition. And yet, men of Athens, a person who\n                    would not shrink from being named as one who had stolen what was prejudicial to\n                    anotherwhat do you suppose he would do in his own interest?\n                        Read the\n                    deposition, and then this challenge.Either depose, or take\n                    the oath of disclaimer.\n                    It was plain\n                    enough, men of the jury, that they would do thistake the oath of\n                    disclaimer with eagerness. Well, then, that they may at once be convicted of\n                    perjury, take, please, this deposition and challenge. Read.\n                    Who is there,\n                    men of the jury, who, on a charge like that, if he were sure of his innocence,\n                    would not have accepted the torture? Then, by refusing the torture, he is\n                    convicted of the theft. Now do you think that a man would be ashamed of the\n                    reputation of having borne false witness, who did not shrink from being proved a\n                    thief? Or that he would hesitate to give false witness at the request of\n                    another, when, at no man's bidding, he voluntarily committed a fraud? Now, men of the jury,\n                    while he might justly be made to pay the penalty for all these things, he\n                    deserves even more to be punished in your court for the rest of his conduct.\n                    Observe the kind of a life he has lived, and judge. For so long as it was the\n                    lot of Aristolochus, the banker, to enjoy prosperity, this fellow fawned upon\n                    him as he walked beside him, adapting his pace to his, and this is well known to\n                    many of you who are present here. But when\n                    Aristolochus was ruined and lost his property, chiefly through having been\n                    plundered by this fellow and others of his stamp, Stephanus never stood by the\n                    son of Aristolochus, who was overburdened with lawsuits, nor aided him, but it\n                    was Apolexis or Solon\n                    or anybody else that helped him rather than he. Then he has courted Phormio and\n                    become intimate with him, choosing him out of all the Athenians; and he sailed\n                    to Byzantium as agent in his interest, when the Byzantines detained\n                    Phormio's vessels, and he pleaded his cause against the Calchedonians, and he has thus flagrantly given false\n                    witness against me. A man, then, who is a\n                    flatterer of those in prosperity, and who betrays these same men if they fall\n                    into adversity; who out of all the host of good and worthy citizens of Athens\n                    deals with not a single one on the basis of equality, but willingly fawns upon\n                    people like Phormio; who takes no thought whether he is going to injure any of\n                    his kinsfolk by these actions, or whether he is going to win an evil reputation\n                    in the minds of other men, but thinks only of one thing, how he may enrich\n                    himselfought you not to loathe this man as a common enemy of the\n                    whole human race? I certainly think so. This\n                    course of action, involving so great disgrace, he has adopted, men of Athens,\n                    with a view to evading his duties to the state and to conceal his wealth, that\n                    he may make secret profits by means of the bank, and never serve as choregus or\n                    trierarch, or perform any other of the public duties which befit his station.\n                    And he has accomplished this object. Here is a proof. Although he has so large\n                    an estate that he gave his daughter a marriage portion of one hundred minae, he\n                    has never been seen by you to perform any public service whatever, even the very\n                    slightest. And yet how much more honorable it would have been to be proved a man\n                    of public spirit and one zealous in the performance of his duties to the state,\n                    than a flatterer and a bearer of false testimony! But the fellow would do\n                    anything to get money. Surely, men of Athens,\n                    you ought to feel indignation rather toward those who are rascals in wealth than\n                    toward those who are such in poverty. In the case of the latter the pressure of\n                    their needy state affords them some excuse in the eyes of those who look on the\n                    matter with human sympathy, whereas those who, like this fellow, are rascals\n                    while possessing abundance, could find no reasonable excuse to offer, but will\n                    be shown to act as they do from a spirit of shameful greed and covetousness and\n                    insolence, and a resolve to make their own plots stronger than the laws. Not one\n                    of these things is to your interest, but rather that the weak, if he suffers\n                    wrong, should be able to get redress from the wealthy. And he will be able, if\n                    you punish those who are thus manifestly rascals while possessing wealth.\n                        Neither\n                    should the airs which the fellow puts on as he walks with sullen face along the\n                    walls be properly considered as marks of sobriety, but rather as marks of\n                    misanthropy. In my opinion a man whom no misfortune has befallen, and who is in\n                    no lack of the necessaries of life, but who none the less habitually maintains\n                    this demeanor,has reviewed the matter and reached the conclusion in his own\n                    mind, that to those who walk in a simple and natural way and wear a cheerful\n                    countenance, men draw near unhesitatingly with requests and proposals, whereas\n                    they shrink from drawing near in the first place to affected and sullen\n                    characters. This demeanor, then, is nothing\n                    but a cloak to cover his real character, and he shows therein the rudeness and\n                    malignity of his temper. Here is a proof. You have been far better off than you\n                    deserved, yet to whom among the whole host of Athenians have you ever made a\n                    contribution? To whom have you ever lent aid, or to whom done a kindness?\n                        You could not name a single one; but while\n                    lending money at interest and regarding the misfortunes and necessities of\n                    others as your own good fortune, you ejected your own uncle Nicias from the\n                    house of his fathers, you have taken from your own mother-in-law the resources\n                    upon which she lived, and you have, in so far as it depended upon you, rendered\n                    homeless the son of Archedemus. No one ever exacted payment from a defaulter as\n                    rigorously as you exact interest from your debtors. A man, then, whom you find\n                    to be so brutal and so savage on all occasions, are you going to fail to punish\n                    him when you have caught him in the very act of wrongdoing? In that case, men of\n                    the jury, you will do what is an outrage and in no sense right. It is fitting\n                    therefore, men of Athens, that you should wax indignant also against Phormio,\n                    for bringing this man forward as a witness, when you see the shamelessness of\n                    his character and his ingratitude. For I fancy you all know that if, when the\n                    fellow was for sale, a cook or an artisan in any other trade had bought him, he\n                    would have learned the trade of his master and been far removed from the\n                    prosperity which now is his. But since my\n                    father into whose possession he came, was a banker and taught him letters and\n                    instructed him in his business and put him in control of large sums of money, he\n                    has become wealthy, having found the good luck which brought him into our family\n                    the foundation of all his present wealth. It\n                    is outrageous, then, O Earth and the gods, and worse than outrageous, that he\n                    should suffer those who made him a Greek instead of a barbarian and a man of\n                    note instead of a slave, and who brought him to such great prosperity, to live\n                    in dire want while he has means and is rich, and that he should have come to\n                    such a pitch of shamelessness that he cannot bring himself to share with us the\n                    good fortune which we shared with him. But for\n                    himself he has not scrupled to marry his mistress, and he dwells as husband with\n                    her who scattered the sweatmeats over him when he was bought as a slave, nor to write a\n                    clause giving himself a marriage portion of five talents in addition to the\n                    large sums of which he became master, inasmuch as they were in the custody of my\n                    motherfor why do you suppose he wrote in the will the clause\n                    and all else which she has I give to\n                    Archipp?while he looks with indifference on my\n                    daughters, who are doomed through poverty to grow old in maidenhood with none to\n                    dower them. If Phormio had been poor, and it\n                    had been our fortune to be wealthy, and if, in the course of nature, anything\n                    had happened to me, this fellow's sons would have claimed my daughters in\n                    marriagethe sons of the slave would have claimed the daughters of the\n                    master! For they are their uncles, since the man married my mother; but seeing\n                    that it is we who are poor, he will not help to portion them off, but he talks\n                    and talks, and reckons up the amount of property which I possess. For this is the most\n                    absurd thing of all. Up to this day he has never seen fit to render an account\n                    of the money of which he has defrauded me, but enters a special plea that my\n                    action is not even admissible; yet he charges against me what I have received\n                    from the estate of my fathers. Other slaves one may see called to strict account\n                    by their masters, but here we see the very opposite: the fellow, though a slave,\n                    calls his master to account, thinking thereby to show him forth as a vile fellow\n                    and a prodigal. For myself, men of Athens, in\n                    the matter of my outward appearance, my fast walking, and my loud voice, I judge\n                    that I am not one of those favored by nature; for in so far as I annoy others\n                    without benefiting myself, I am in many respects at a disadvantage; but since I\n                    am moderate in all my personal expenses, it will be seen that I live a much more\n                    orderly life than Phormio and others who are like him. Whatever concerns the state, however, and all that concerns you, I\n                    perform, as you know, as lavishly as I can; for I am well aware that for you who\n                    are citizens by birth it is sufficient to perform public services as the laws\n                    require; we on the contrary who are created citizens ought to show that we\n                    perform them as a grateful payment of a debt. Cease, then, to fling into my\n                    teeth matters for which I should properly win commendation. But, Phormio, whom of the citizens have I hired for\n                    prostitution, as you have done? Show me. Whom have I deprived of the citizenship\n                    of which I was deemed worthy, and of the right of free speech in the city, as\n                    you did in the case of the man whom you dishonored? Whose wife have I debauched,\n                    as you have the wives of many?among them her to whom this\n                    god-detested fellow built the monument near that of his mistress at a cost of\n                    more than two talents. And he did not see that a structure, being of that sort,\n                    would be a monument, not of her tomb, but of the wrong which because of him she\n                    had done to her husband. Do you, then, who\n                    perform acts like these, and who have given such manifest proofs of your\n                    outrageous conduct, dare to scrutinize the manner of life of anyone else? By day\n                    you act soberly, but the whole night long you indulge in actions for which death\n                    is the penalty. He is a knave, men of Athens, a knave and a villain, and has\n                    been such from of old, ever since he left the temple of Castor and Pollux. Here is the proof. If he had been honest, he would have managed\n                    his master's business, and remained poor. But as it is, having got control of so\n                    large an amount of money that he could steal from it all that he now possesses\n                    without detection, he regards what he holds, not as a debt, but as an inherited\n                    patrimony. And yet, by the gods, if I had led\n                    you off to prison as a thief caught in the act, piling upon your\n                    backif this had been in any way possiblethe wealth which\n                    you now possess, and had then demanded of you, if you denied having got this\n                    wealth by thievery, to refer me to the source from which you got it, to whom\n                    would you have referred me? Your father did not give it to you; you did not find\n                    it; you had not got it from some other source when you come into our family; for\n                    you were a barbarian when you were purchased. Have you, then, a man who ought to\n                    have been publicly put to death for what you have done, after saving your skin,\n                    after securing for yourself a city with our money, and after being allowed to\n                    beget children as brothers to your own mastershave you entered a\n                    special plea that our action for the sums claimed from you is inadmissible?\n                        And, then, did you speak evil of me, and\n                    inquire what manner of man my father was? Men of Athens, who would not have been\n                    indignant at this? For my part, though it beseem me to have less of pride than\n                    any of you, yet I judge that I may at least have more than Phormio, while as for\n                    him, though there be no one else than whom he should have less, yet he should\n                    have less than I; for, assuming that we are the sort of people your words made\n                    us out to be, you, Phormio, were none the less our slave. There is perhaps\n                    something else which one of them may say: that Pasicles, although he is my\n                    brother, makes no charge against Phormio for these same actions. Well, I will\n                    speak about Pasicles, too, men of Athens, though I beg and implore you to pardon\n                    me, if I am so carried away by indignation at the outrages I have received from\n                    my own slaves as to be unable to restrain myself; I will not keep silent, but\n                    will declare what until now I pretended not to hear when others said\n                    it; I consider Pasicles to be my\n                    brother on my mother's side, but whether on my father's side also, I do not\n                    know; but I am afraid that the wrongs which Phormio has done us began with\n                    Pasicles. For when he joins in pleading the cause of the slave and dishonors his\n                    brother, when he fawns upon those, and curries the favor of those, who ought to\n                    seek his favor, to what suspicion does this naturally give rise? Away, then,\n                    with Pasicles, and let him be called your son instead of your master, and my\n                    adversary since he so chooses instead of my brother.\n                        I bid adieu\n                    to this fellow and appeal to those to whom my father left me as my helpers and\n                    friendsto you, men of the jury. And I beg and entreat and implore\n                    you, do not suffer my daughters and myself through our poverty to become a\n                    source of malicious joy to my own slaves and to his flatterers. My father gave\n                    you a thousand shields and made himself serviceable to you in many ways, and\n                    five times served as trierarch, voluntarily equipping the ships and manning them\n                    at his own expense. I remind you of this, not because I consider that you are\n                    under obligation to mefor it is I that am under obligation to\n                    you,but in order that I may not suffer unworthy treatment without\n                    your knowing it. For that would not be a credit to you any more than to me.\n                        I have much\n                    to say regarding the indignities which I have suffered, but I see that I have\n                    not enough water left in the clock. I will tell you, therefore, how I think you\n                    will all best come to know the enormity of the wrongs that have been done me.\n                    You must each of you consider what slave he left at home, and then imagine that\n                    you have suffered from him the same treatment that I have suffered from Phormio.\n                    Do not take into consideration that they are severally Syrus or Manes or what\n                    not, while this fellow is Phormio. The thing is the samethey are\n                    slaves, and he was a slave; you are masters, and I was master. Believe, then, that it is fitting now for me to exact\n                    the penalty which each one of you would claim; and in the interest of the laws\n                    and of the oaths which you have taken as jurors punish the man who has robbed me\n                    of a verdict by giving false testimony, and make him an example to others,\n                    remembering all that you have heard from me and bearing it in mind, if they\n                    attempt to mislead you, and meeting them at every point. If they deny that they\n                    have borne witness to all the facts, ask them these questions, What\n                    stands written in the deposition? Why did you not strike it out at the time?\n                    What is the counter-plea in the custody of the archons? If they declare that they have testified, one person\n                    that he lived as ward under a will, another that he served as guardian, and\n                    another that he has the will in his possession, demand of them, What\n                    will? What were the provisions contained in it? For to the deposition\n                    to which these men bore witness no one of the others has given corroborative\n                    testimony. But if they try whining tactics, you should consider that the one\n                    wronged is more deserving of pity than those about to be punished. If you act in\n                    this way, you will succor me, and you will restrain these men from their\n                    excessive adulation; and to your own satisfaction you will have rendered a\n                    righteous verdict."}}, {"@type": "speech", "@n": "46", "head": "Apollodorus Against Stephanus 2", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "13"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "14"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "15"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "16"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "17"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "18"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "19"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "20"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "21"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "22"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "23"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "24"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "25"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "26"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "27"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "28"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}], "quote": [{"@type": "Law", "title": "Law", "milestone": {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, "#text": "It shall be lawful to\n                        introduce hearsay evidence from one that is dead, and written evidence given\n                        in absence from one who is out of the country, or is sick."}, {"@type": "Law", "title": "Law", "milestone": {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, "#text": "The two parties to a\n                        suit shall be compelled to answer one another's questions, but they may not\n                        testify."}, {"@type": "Law", "title": "Law", "milestone": {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, "#text": "The witness shall also\n                        be liable to action for giving false testimony on the mere ground that he\n                        gives evidence contrary to law, and the one producing him shall also be\n                        liable in the selfsame manner."}, {"@type": "Law", "title": "Law", "milestone": {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, "note": [{"@resp": "Loeb", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The precise meaning of this\n                            phrase is disputed.

For he is a knave, and\n                    there are many to write speeches and give advice on Phormio's behalf.\n                    Furthermore it is but natural that those who undertake to give false testimony\n                    should at the start prepare some means of defending it. But I bid you to bear this in mind, that in his\n                    address, long as it was, he nowhere brought forward witnesses to prove to you\n                    either that he was himself present when my father made this will, so as to know\n                    that this is a copy of the will which my father made, or that he saw the\n                    document opened which they declare my father drew up and left as his will.\n                        When, however, my opponent has testified\n                    that what was written in the document was a copy of the will of Pasio, but is\n                    unable to prove either that my father made a will or that he was himself present\n                    and saw it when my father drew it up, is he not manifestly proved to have given\n                    false testimony? If, now, he maintains that it was a challenge and not a deposition, he is not\n                    telling the truth. For all pieces of evidence which the parties to a suit bring\n                    before the court when they tender challenges to one another, they bring in by\n                    means of depositions. Otherwise you would not know whether what they severally\n                    say is true or false, if they did not bring forward the witnesses also. But when\n                    they do bring in witnesses, you rely upon these as being responsible, and so\n                    from the statements and the testimony offered you cast your votes for what seems\n                    to you to be a just verdict. I wish therefore\n                    to prove to you that the deposition is not a challenge, and to show you how they\n                    ought to have deposed if the challenge was given, which it was\n                    not,The deponents testify that they were present before\n                    the arbitrator Teisias, when Phormio challenged Apollodorus to open the document\n                    which Amphias, the brother-in-law of Cephisophon, produced, and that Apollodorus\n                    refused to open it. If they had given their evidence in this way,\n                    they would have appeared to be speaking the truth. But to depose that what was\n                    written in the document which Phormio produced was a copy of the will of Pasio,\n                    without having been present when Pasio made the will, or knowing that he had\n                    made one, does this not seem to you to be a manifest piece of insolence?\n                        And surely,\n                    if he says that he believed this to be true because Phormio said it was, it\n                    would be like the same man to believe him when he said this, and to testify to\n                    it at his bidding. The laws, however, do not say this, but ordain that a man may\n                    testify to what he knows, or to matters at the doing of which he was present,\n                    and that his testimony must be committed to writing in order that it may not be\n                    possible to subtract anything from what is written, or to add anything to it.\n                        Hearsay evidence they do not admit from a\n                    living person, but only from one who is dead; but in the case of those who are\n                    sick or absent from the country they allow evidence to be introduced, provided\n                    it be in written form, and the absent witness and the one submitting his\n                    testimony shall alike be liable to action under the same impeachment, in order\n                    that, if the absent witness acknowledges his evidence, he may be liable to\n                    action for giving false testimony, and if he does not acknowledge it, the one\n                    who submitted his testimony may be liable. Now\n                    Stephanus here, without knowing that my father left a will or having ever been\n                    present when he drew one up, but having been told this by Phormio, has given\n                    hearsay evidence which is false, and has done it in defiance of the\n                        law.To prove that I am telling the truth in\n                    this, the clerk shall read you the law itself.\n                    Now I wish to\n                    prove to you that he has given evidence contrary to another law also, that you\n                    may know that Phormio, having no harbor of refuge from the grievous wrongs he\n                    has committed, had made a pretence of the challenge, but actually has given\n                    evidence for himself, screening himself behind the testimony of these men, by\n                    which the jurymen were deceived, assuming that they were testifying to the\n                    truth, and I was robbed of the property which my father left me and of\n                    reparation for the wrongs which I have suffered. For the laws do not permit a\n                    man to give evidence for himself either in criminal suits or in civil suits or\n                    in audits. Phormio, however, has given evidence for himself, when these men say\n                    that they have given this testimony on the strength of what they heard from him.\n                        But that\n                    you may be fully convinced of this, please read the law itself.Now consider this law also\n                    which ordains that action for false testimony may also be brought on this very\n                    ground, namely, that one testifies contrary to law.\n                    Furthermore,\n                    even from the tablet upon which the deposition is written one can tell that he\n                    has given false evidence. For it is whitened, and was prepared at home. Yet it is only those who testify to facts who should\n                    offer depositions prepared at home; those who testify to challenges, who stand\n                    forward on the spur of the moment, should present their depositions written in\n                    wax, in order that, if one wants to add or to erase anything, it may be easier\n                    to do so. In all these things, then, he is\n                    shown to have given false testimony, and to have given it contrary to law; but I\n                    wish to prove this further fact, that our father did not make a will, and could\n                    not legally make one. For, if anyone should ask you in accordance with what laws\n                    we should live as citizens, you would of course answer, the established laws.\n                    But look you, the laws ordain, nor shall it be permitted to enact a\n                    law applying to an individual, unless the same law applies also to all the\n                    Athenians. This law, then, ordains\n                    that we should live as citizens under the same laws and not one under one law,\n                    another under another. But my father died during the archonship of\n                        Dysnicetus, and Phormio became\n                    an Athenian citizen during the archonship of Nicophemus, in the tenth year after my father died.\n                    How, then, could my father, not knowing that Phormio was to become an Athenian\n                    citizen, have given him in marriage his own wife, and thus have outraged us,\n                    shown his contempt of the gift of citizenship which he had received from you,\n                    and disregarded your laws? And which was the more honorable course for\n                    himto do this during his lifetime, supposing he wished to do it, or\n                    to leave behind him at his death a will which he had no legal right to make?\n                        And verily, when you have heard the laws\n                    themselves you will see clearly that Pasio had no right to make a\n                        will.Read the law.\n                    You have heard\n                    the law, then, which does not permit a man to dispose of his property by will,\n                    if he have male children lawfully born. But these men declare that my father\n                    made this will, yet they cannot prove that they were present at the time.\n                    Another thing also deserves to be borne in mind, that it is to those who had not\n                    been adopted, but were lawfully born, that the law gives the right, in case of\n                    their being childless, to dispose of their property by will. Now my father had\n                    been adopted as a citizen by the people, so that on this account also he had not\n                    the right to make a will, especially in regard to his wife, of whom he was not\n                    even the legal guardian; and besides he had children. Note further, that even if a man be childless, he has not the right\n                    to dispose of his property by will, unless he be of sound mind; but if he be\n                    impaired by disease or the effect of drugs, or be under the influence of a\n                    woman, or be the victim of old age or madness, or be under constraint, the laws\n                    ordain that he be incompetent. Now consider whether the will, which these men\n                    say my father made, seems to you to be the will of a man of sound mind.\n                        Taking the lease, and nothing else, as an\n                    example, tell me whether it seems to you consistent that my father should refuse\n                    Phormio permission to carry on his business except in association with us, and\n                    yet that he should give him his wife in marriage, and thus make him a partner in\n                    his own fatherhood? And do not be surprised that, while they were arranging all\n                    else in regard to the lease so cleverly, they overlooked this. For perhaps they\n                    paid no heed to anything else, save to rob me of my money and to set my father\n                    down as a debtor to the bank; and then they did not suppose that I should be\n                    clever enough to look into these matters closely. Now, then, consider the laws, and see\n                    from whom they ordain that betrothals should be made, that you may come to know\n                    from them also, that this fellow Stephanus has proved himself to be a false\n                    witness to a forged will.\n                    You have heard\n                    what persons this law has appointed to be guardians; and that my mother had none\n                    of these my opponents have themselves borne witness. For if there had been such,\n                    they would have produced them. Or do you suppose they would have produced false\n                    witnesses and a non-existent will, but would not have produced a brother or a\n                    grandfather or a father, if they could have done it for money? Since, then, it\n                    is plain that no one of these was living, it follows necessarily that my mother\n                    was an heiress. Now see whom the law ordains to be guardians of an heiress.\n                        Read the\n                        law.The law, then,\n                    appoints that sons who have reached the age of manhood shall be guardians of\n                    their mother and shall make due provision for their mother's maintenance. But it\n                    is clear that I was on a military expedition and in command of a trireme in your\n                        service, when this man married my mother. Nay more, to prove that I was absent in command of a trireme, and\n                    that my father had been dead for some time, when the fellow married, I demanded\n                    of him the female slaves, and claimed the right of having them put to the\n                    torture to establish this very point, whether what I am saying is\n                    trueto prove all this, and that I tendered him a challenge, please\n                    take the deposition.\n                    Now in addition to this read the law which\n                    appoints that there shall be an adjudication of all heiresses, whether alien or\n                    citizen, and that in the case of those who are citizens the archon shall have\n                    jurisdiction and shall take charge of the matter, and in the case of those who\n                    are resident aliens, the polemarch; and it shall not be lawful for anyone to\n                    obtain an inheritance or an heiress without legal adjudication.\n                    Well then, if\n                    he had wished to proceed regularly, he ought to have entered his claim for the\n                    heiress, whether the claim was based upon a gift or upon nearness of kin, before\n                    the archon, if he claimed her as a citizen, and before the polemarch, if as an\n                    alien; and then, if he had any just claim to advance, it was his duty to\n                    convince those of you who were drawn on the jury, and so obtain the woman by\n                    their verdict and in a manner sanctioned by your laws, instead of having made\n                    laws valid for himself alone, and in that way having accomplished what he\n                    desired. Note,\n                    too, the following law, that a will shall be valid which a father makes, even\n                    though he has sons lawfully born, provided the sons die before they reach the\n                    age of manhood.\n                    Well then,\n                    seeing that the sons are alive, the will which these men say my father left is\n                    invalid, and this man Stephanus has borne false witness in defiance of all the\n                    laws, in declaring that the document is a copy of Pasio's will. Why, how do you\n                    know that it is? Where were you ever present when my father made it? You are\n                    shown to have been guilty of trickery in the suit, to have given false witness\n                    yourself without scruple, to have stolen depositions which supported the truth,\n                    to have misled the jury, and to have entered into a conspiracy to defeat\n                    justice. But the laws have provided criminal suits for actions such as these.\n                        Read the\n                    law, please.\n                    So, in the\n                    light of all these things, I should like to ask you in accordance with what laws\n                    you have sworn to give judgement: whether according to the laws of the state, or\n                    according to the laws which Phormio enacts for himself. I bring before you,\n                    then, these laws, and I prove that both these men have transgressed them,\n                    Phormio by having at the outset wronged me and robbed me of the money which my\n                    father left me, and which that father leased to Phormio together with the bank\n                    and the manufactory; Stephanus here, by having given false testimony, and\n                    given it in defiance of the law. Another thing also, men of the jury, deserves to be\n                    borne in mind, that no one ever makes a copy of a will; they make copies of\n                    contracts, that they may know the terms and not violate them; but not of wills.\n                    For this is the very reason why the testators leave a willthat no man\n                    may know how they are disposing of their property. How, then, do you people know\n                    that what is written in the document is a copy of Pasio's will?I beseech and implore you all, men of the jury, to come to my\n                    aid

And for\n                    this reason they have made the fine less for the plaintiff, if he lose his case,\n                    in order that those who have been wronged may not by the fine be deterred from\n                    prosecuting witnesses for false testimony, while they have imposed a heavy\n                    penalty upon the defendant, if he be convicted and be thought by you to have\n                    given false testimony. And justly so, men of\n                    the jury. For you look to the witnesses and give your verdict as you do, because\n                    you have believed the testimony which they have given. It is, therefore, to\n                    prevent you from being deceived and those who come into your court from being\n                    wronged that the lawgiver made the witnesses responsible. I, therefore, beg of\n                    you hear me with goodwill, while I rehearse all the facts from the beginning, in\n                    order that from these you may see the magnitude of the wrongs I have suffered,\n                    and know that the jurymen were deceived and that these men have given testimony\n                    which is false. I should have much preferred not to go to law, but, if forced to do so, it is\n                    a satisfaction to appear against men who are not unknown to you. However, I\n                    shall devote a larger part of my speech to exposing the character of these men\n                    than to proving that their testimony is false. As to my charge that the\n                    testimony to which they have deposed is false, they seem to me to have given\n                    proof by their own actions, and there is no need for me to produce any other\n                    witnesses than themselves. For when they might\n                    have got rid of all trouble, and have avoided the risk which they run in coming\n                    into your court, by establishing in fact the truth of their testimony, they have\n                    refused to deliver up the woman, whom they have testified that Theophemus was\n                    ready to deliver up, and had offered to deliver up before the arbitrator,\n                    Pythodorus of Cedae, but whose surrender I, in fact, demanded,\n                    as the witnesses who were then present in court testified, and will now testify.\n                    And Theophemus has not impeached them for giving testimony that was not true,\n                    nor does he proceed against them for false witness. The defendants themselves practically\n                    admit in their deposition that I was anxious to receive the woman for the\n                    torture, and that Theophemus urged me to postpone the action, whereas I was\n                    unwilling to do so. And yet it was regarding this woman, whom I demanded for the\n                    torture, but whom Theophemus offered to give up, as these men say; whom,\n                    however, no one ever saw present in person either at that time before the\n                    arbitrator or afterwards in the court-room, or produced at any other\n                    place,it was regarding her that these witnesses deposed that\n                    Theophemus was ready to give her up, and made the offer with a challenge;\n                        and the jury thought that the testimony was\n                    true, and that I was seeking to evade the evidence which the woman might have\n                    given in regard to the assault and the question as to which one of us delivered\n                    the first blow for this is what constitutes assault. Is it\n                    not, then, a necessary inference that these witnesses have given false\n                    testimony, men who even up to this day dare not deliver up the woman in person,\n                    as according to their statement Theophemus offered to do, and as they testified\n                    for him? And they dare not establish by actual fact the truth of their testimony\n                        and free the witnesses from the risk of a\n                    trial by making Theophemus, since he then refused to do so, deliver up the woman\n                    in person, to be put to the torture regarding the assault for which I am suing\n                    Theophemus, and so make the proof result from the very statements made at that\n                    time by Theophemus with a view to deceiving the jurors. For he said in the\n                    course of the trial for assault that the witnesses who had been present and who\n                    testified to what had taken place by a deposition in writing, as the law\n                    provides, were false witnesses and had been suborned by me; but that the woman\n                    who had been present would tell the truth, deposing, not to a written document,\n                    but under torture, giving thus the strongest kind of evidence as to which party\n                    delivered the first blow. This is what he said\n                    at that time, using the most vigorous language and bringing forward witnesses to\n                    support his statements, and by this means deceiving the jurors; but now all this\n                    is proved to be false; for he does not dare to deliver up the woman, whom the\n                    witnesses have declared that he was ready to deliver up, but prefers that his\n                    brother and his brother-in-law should have to stand trial on a charge of giving\n                    false testimony, rather than that he should deliver up the woman in person, and\n                    so be well rid of his troubles in a fair and legal way, and that they should not\n                    try by arguments and entreaties to find a means of escape by deceiving you, if\n                    they could; although I challenged him again\n                    and again, and asked for the woman, demanding to receive her for the torture\n                    both at that time and after the trial, and again when I paid them the money, and\n                    in my suit for assault against Theophemus, and in the examination before the\n                    magistrate in the trial for false testimony. These men do not try to hide\n                    anything; their words are perjury, their act is to refuse to deliver up the\n                    woman; for they knew well that, if she should be put to the torture, it would be\n                    proved that they were the wrongdoers and not the parties wronged.To prove that I am speaking the truth in this, the clerk\n                    shall read you the depositions concerning these matters.\n                    That, despite\n                    my frequent challenges and demands for the delivery of the woman for\n                    examination, no one has ever delivered her up, has been shown to you by\n                    witnesses. But in order that you may know from circumstantial proofs also that\n                    they have given false testimony, I will prove it. For if what they state were\n                    true, namely, that Theophemus tendered the challenge and offered to give up the\n                    woman in person, these men, I take it, would not have produced two witnesses\n                    only, a brother and a brother-in-law, to testify to what was true, but many\n                    others as well. For the arbitration took place\n                    in the Heliaea, where those serving as\n                    arbitrators for the Oened and Erecthed tribes hold their\n                    sessions; and when challenges of this sort are given, and a party brings his\n                    slave in person, and delivers him up for examination by the torture, hosts of\n                    people stand forth to hear what is said; so that they would not have been at a\n                    loss for witnesses, if there had been the least truth in the deposition.\n                        They have\n                    testified, then, in the same deposition, men of the jury, that I was unwilling\n                    to have a postponement, but that Theophemus urged it in order that he might\n                    produce the woman. That this is not true, I will show you. For if I had tendered\n                    to Theophemus this challenge to which they have deposed, requiring him to\n                    deliver up the woman, he might fittingly have\n                    answered by urging that the arbitration be put off until the next meeting, in\n                    order that he might bring the woman and deliver her up to me; but as it is,\n                    Theophemus, they have deposed that it was you who desired to deliver up the\n                    woman and that I was not willing to receive her. How is it that you, who were\n                    the woman's master, when you were on the point of tendering me this challenge,\n                    to which your witnesses have deposed, when you were forced to take refuge in\n                    this woman's testimony to establish your case, and when you had no other witness to my having assaulted you and having\n                    delivered the first blowhow is it, I ask, that you did not bring the\n                    woman with you to the arbitrator and deliver her up, having her then present in\n                    person, and being yourself her master? Nay, you state that you tendered the\n                    challenge; but no one saw the woman by means of whom you deceived the jurors,\n                    through producing false witnesses to represent that you wished to give her up.\n                        Well, then,\n                    since the woman was not present with you at that time and the boxes had\n                    previously been sealed, did you at any time afterward bring her into the\n                    market-place or before the court? For if she was not present with you at that\n                    time, you surely ought to have delivered her up afterwards, and to have called\n                    witnesses to prove that you were willing to have the test made by the woman's\n                    evidence in accordance with the challenge which you had tendered, as your\n                    challenge had been put in the box, and a deposition stating that you were ready\n                    to deliver her up. Well then, when you were on the point of entering upon the\n                    trial, did you ever bring the woman before the court? And yet, if what they say about his tendering the challenge is true,\n                    he ought, when the court-rooms were being assigned by lot, to have brought the\n                    woman, got a herald to attend, and bidden me, if I chose, to put her to the\n                    torture, and have made the jurors as they came in witnesses to the fact that he\n                    was ready to deliver her up. But as it is, he has made deceitful statements and\n                    has produced false witnesses, but even to this day he does not dare to deliver\n                    up the woman, though I have made repeated challenges and demands, as the\n                    witnesses who were present have testified before you.Please read the depositions again.\n                    I wish now, men\n                    of the jury, to explain to you the origin of my action against Theophemus, in\n                    order that you may be assured that he not only secured my condemnation unjustly\n                    by deceiving the jury, but also at the same time secured by the same verdict the\n                    condemnation of the senate of five hundred, and made of no effect the decisions\n                    of your courts and of no effect your decrees and your laws, and shook your faith\n                    in your magistrates and in the inscriptions on the public stelae. How he has done this I will show you point by point.\n                        I never before at any time in my life had\n                    any business transaction with Theophemus, nor yet any revel or love-affair or\n                    drinking-bout, to lead me to go to his house, because of a quarrel with him\n                    about some matter in which he had got the better of me, or under the excitement\n                    of amorous passion. No, but in obedience to decrees passed by your assembly and\n                    senate and at the bidding of the law I demanded of him the ship's equipment\n                    which he owed to the state. For what reason, I shall proceed to tell you.\n                        It chanced that some triremes were about\n                    to sail, a military force having to be despatched in haste. Now there was not in\n                    the dockyards equipment for the ships, but those from whom it was due, who had\n                    in their possession such equipment, had failed to return it; and furthermore\n                    there was not available for purchase in the Peiraeus either an adequate supply\n                    of sail-cloth and tow and cordage, which serve for the equipment of a trireme.\n                    Chaeridemus, therefore, proposed this decree, in order that the equipment for\n                    the ships might be recovered and kept safe for the state.Read the decree, please.\n                    When this\n                    decree had been passed, the magistrates chose by lot those who owed the ship's\n                    equipment to the state and handed over their names, and the overseers of the\n                    dockyards passed on the list to the trierarchs who were then about to sail, and\n                    to the overseers of the navy-boards. The law of Periander forced us and laid command upon us to\n                    receive the list of those who owed equipment to the state,I mean the\n                    law in accordance with which the navy-boards were constituted. And besides this\n                    another decree of the people compelled them to assign to us the several debtors\n                    that we might recover from each man his proportionate amount. Now I, as it happened, was a trierarch and overseer\n                    of the navy-board, and Demochares of Paeania was in the navy-board,\n                    and was indebted to the state for the equipment of a ship in conjunction with\n                    Theophemus here, for he had served as joint trierarch with him. Both their\n                    names, then, had been inscribed on the stel as indebted to the state\n                    for the ship's equipment, and the magistrates, receiving their names from those\n                    in office before them, gave them over to us in accordance with the law and the\n                    decrees. It was therefore a matter of\n                    necessity for us to receive them. I must tell you that hitherto, although I had\n                    often served as your trierarch, I had never taken equipment from the dockyards,\n                    but had supplied it at my own private expense whenever need arose, in order that\n                    I might have as little trouble as possible with the state. On this occasion,\n                    however, I was compelled to take over the names in accordance with the decrees\n                    and the law. To\n                    prove that I am speaking the truth in this, I shall produce as witnesses\n                    supporting these facts, the decree and the law, next the magistrate who gave the\n                    names over to me and who brought the case into court, and finally the members of\n                    the navy-board in which I was overseer and trierarch.Read, please.\n                    That it was\n                    absolutely necessary, therefore, for me to take over the names of those indebted\n                    to the state, you have heard from the law and the decrees; and that I took them\n                    over from the magistrate, the one who delivered them to me has testified. So,\n                    then, the first question for you to consider at the outset, men of the jury, is\n                    this, whether the wrongdoer was I, who was compelled to recover from Theophemus\n                    what he owed, or Theophemus, who had long owed the equipment to the state and\n                    refused to give it back. For if you look at\n                    each matter severally, you will find that Theophemus was wholly in the wrong,\n                    and that this is not merely a statement of mine but a fact decided by vote of\n                    the senate and the court. For when I had received his name from the magistrate,\n                    I approached him and first demanded the ship's equipment; when he refused to\n                    give it back on my making this statement, I subsequently fell in with him near\n                    the Hermes which stands by the little gate and summoned him before\n                    the despatching board and the overseers of the dockyards; for it was they who at\n                    that time brought into court suits regarding ship's equipments. To prove that I am\n                    speaking the truth, I shall produce as witnesses to these facts those who served\n                    the summons.That he was summoned by me, then, has\n                    been testified to you by those who served the summons; now to prove that he was\n                    brought into court, take the deposition of the despatching board and the\n                        magistrates.\n                    The one who I\n                    thought would give me trouble, Demochares of Paeania, was indeed disagreeable\n                    before he was brought into court, but after he had been tried and convicted he\n                    returned the part of the ship's equipment that was due from him. But the one\n                    whom I should never have expected to go to such an extreme of rascality that he\n                    would ever dare to rob the state of the equipment, has gone ahead with all these\n                    troublesome lawsuits. He was present in the court-room when the suit was brought\n                    in, but never made any defence, nor did he give in the name of anyone for an\n                        adjudication, as he should have done, if he\n                    claims that someone else has the equipment and that it was not his duty to give\n                    it back; but he suffered the verdict to be given against him; yet after he left the courtroom he did not pay any\n                    the more because of that, but decided that for the time being he would keep out\n                    of the way and remain quiet until I should have sailed with the fleet, and some\n                    time should have elapsed, thinking that I should have to pay for the equipment\n                    which he owed to the state either when I returned here, or else to my successor\n                    who should come from the navy-boards to take command of the ship. For what\n                    answer could I have given this man, when he produced decrees and laws showing\n                    that I was obliged to recover the equipment? And Theophemus, after a lapse of time, when I had come back and made demands\n                    upon him, would have said that he had paid back the equipment, and to show that\n                    he had paid would have insisted upon these proofsthe crisis, the\n                    urgency, and that I was not such a fool and had never been such a friend of his\n                    as to wait; for what possible reason, then, when I was serving the state as\n                    trierarch and was overseer of the navy-board, and when decrees of such a nature\n                    and such a law were in force, should I have obliged him by delaying the\n                    collection? It was because Theophemus reasoned\n                    in this way that he then refused to restore the equipment but kept himself out\n                    of the way, and thought that later on he would he able to rob me; and besides\n                    this, he could take refuge in an oath and perjure himself without trouble, a\n                    thing which he has done to others also. For the greediness of the man's\n                    character in matters where his interests are involved is dreadful, as I shall\n                    show you in fact. For Theophemus, while owing this equipment to the state, made\n                    a pretence of shifting the charge to Aphareus, but in actual fact he never\n                    reported his name for an adjudication, well knowing that he would be convicted\n                    of falsehood, if he should come into court. For Aphareus proved that Theophemus had reckoned up against him the cost of\n                    the equipment and had got the money from him, when he took over the trierarchy.\n                    Now Theophemus maintains that he gave it over to Demochares, and he is suing the\n                    children of Demochares, who is now dead. But, while Demochares lived, Theophemus\n                    did not report his name for an adjudication when he was being sued by me for the\n                    equipment; he merely wished, on the pretence of the lapse of time, to rob the\n                    state of the equipment.To prove that I am\n                    speaking the truth, the clerk shall read you the depositions.\n                    Bearing all\n                    these facts in mind, therefore, and hearing from those who had had dealings with\n                    Theophemus what sort of a man he was in matters where his interests were\n                    involved, and failing to recover the equipment from him, I approached the\n                    despatching board and the senate, stating that Theophemus would not return to me\n                    the equipment for which he was accountable by judgement of the court. And the\n                    other trierarchs also approached the senate, all those who had not been able to\n                    recover the equipment from the persons bound to produce it. And after much\n                    argument the senate answered by a decree which the clerk shall read to you,\n                    instructing us to recover what was due in whatever way we could.\n                    When, then, the\n                    decree had been passed by the senate, since no one indicted it for illegality,\n                    but it became valid, I approached this man Evergus, the brother of Theophemus,\n                    since I was unable to see Theophemus; and having the decree in my hand I first\n                    demanded the return of the equipment, and bade him inform Theophemus; then,\n                    after allowing a few days to pass, since he refused to return the equipment, but\n                    only jeered at me, I took some witnesses with me, and asked him whether he had\n                    divided the estate with his brother, or whether their property was held in\n                    common. On Evergus's answering me that it had\n                    been divided and that Theophemus lived in a house by himself, but that he\n                    Evergus lived with his father, I thus learned where\n                    Theophemus lived, and taking with me a servant from the magistrates, I went to\n                    Theophemus's house. As I did not find him at home, I bade the woman who answered\n                    the door to go and fetch him wherever he might be. This was the woman, whom,\n                    according to the depositions of these men, Theophemus offered to deliver up, but\n                    whom, after repeated demands, I cannot get from him, that you might learn the\n                    truth as to which party began the assault. But\n                    when Theophemus came in, after the woman had gone to fetch him, I asked for the\n                    inventory of the equipment, telling him that I was now on the point of sailing;\n                    and I showed him the decree of the senate. When, on my saying this, he refused\n                    to give it up, but began to threaten me and abuse me, I bade the boy call in\n                    from the street any citizens\n                    whom he might see passing by, that I might have them as witnesses to what was\n                    said, and I again made demand upon Theophemus\n                    either to go with me himself to the despatching board and the senate, and, if he\n                    denied that he was liable, to convince those who had given over the names and\n                    compelled us to seek to recover what was due, or else to pay back the equipment;\n                    otherwise, I declared that I should take goods as security in accordance with\n                    the laws and the decrees. Since he was not willing to do anything that was\n                    right, I started to lead away the woman who was standing by the door, the same\n                    one who had gone to fetch him. He seized her\n                    to prevent me, and I let go of the woman, but proceeded to enter the house to\n                    take some security for the equipment due; for the door, as it happened, had been\n                    opened when Theophemus came, and he had not yet gone in. I had already informed\n                    myself that he was not married. As I was going in\n                    Theophemus struck me on the mouth with his fist, and I, calling upon those who\n                    were present to bear witness, returned the blow. Now the proof that what I am saying is true, and that Theophemus\n                    began the assault, needs, I think, nothing else for its establishment than the\n                    testimony of the woman whom these witnesses have stated that Theophemus was\n                    ready to deliver up. By means of this testimony Theophemus, whose case came\n                    first into court, seeing that I did not enter a special plea or an affidavit for\n                    delay, since these measures had once been a disadvantage to me in a former suit,\n                    deceived the jurors, saying that the witnesses whom I had brought forward gave\n                    false testimony, but that this woman would tell the truth if she were put to the\n                    torture. But their actions now are shown to be\n                    the very opposite of the language which they then used with such insistence; for\n                    I am unable to get the woman for examination despite repeated demands, as has\n                    been stated to you by witnesses. Since, therefore, they refuse to deliver up the\n                    woman, whom they themselves declare that I was challenged to receive, I desire\n                    to call before you the witnesses who saw Theophemus deal me the first blow. And\n                    this is what constitutes assault, when a man commits the first act of violence,\n                    especially when he strikes one who is seeking to exact payment in accordance\n                    with the laws and your decrees.Please read the\n                    decrees and the deposition.\n                    So when the\n                    pledge which I had seized had been taken from me by Theophemus, and I had been\n                    beaten, I went to the senate and showed them the marks of the blows, and told\n                    them how I had been treated, and also that it was while I was seeking to collect\n                    for the state the ship's equipment. The senate, angered at the treatment which I\n                    had received and seeing the plight that I was in, thinking, too, that the insult\n                    had been offered, not to me, but to itself and the assembly which had passed the\n                    decree and the law which compelled us to exact payment for the\n                    equipment, the senate, I say,\n                    ordered me to prefer an impeachment, and that the prytanes\n                    should give Theophemus two days' notice of trial on a charge of breaking the law\n                    and of impeding the fleet's departure, charging further that he had refused to\n                    return the ship's equipment and had taken from me the pledge which I had seized,\n                    and beaten me when I was seeking to collect what was due and was performing my\n                    duty to the state. Well, then, the trial of Theophemus came on before the senate\n                    in accordance with the impeachment which I had preferred; and after both sides\n                    had been heard and the senators had cast their votes secretly, he was convicted\n                    in the senate-chamber and adjudged to be guilty. And when the senate was going into a division on the question\n                    whether it should remand him to a jury-court or sentence him to a fine of five\n                    hundred drachmae, the highest penalty which the law allowed it to inflict, while\n                    all these men were making pleas and entreaties and sending any number of people\n                    to intercede for them, and offering us right there in the senate-chamber the\n                    inventory of the equipment due, and promising to submit the question of the\n                    assault to any one of the Athenians whom I should name, I consented that a fine\n                    of twenty-five drachmae should be imposed upon Theophemus.\n                        To prove\n                    that I am speaking the truth in this, I beg all of you who were senators in the\n                    archonship of Agathocles to tell the facts to those who sit\n                    by you, and I will bring before you as witnesses all those whom I have been able\n                    to find who were senators that year.I, you see, men of the jury, showed\n                    myself thus reasonable toward these men. And yet the decree ordered the\n                    confiscation of the property, not only of those who had ship's equipment and did\n                    not return it to the state, but also of anyone who, having such equipment,\n                    refused to sell it; such a scarcity of equipment was there in the city at that\n                        time.Read the decree, please.\n                    When I had come\n                    back from my voyage, men of the jury, as Theophemus refused to refer to anyone\n                    the matter of the blows which he had dealt me, I summoned him, and began an\n                    action against him for assault. He summoned me in a cross-action, and while the\n                    arbitrators had the causes before them, and the time came for making the award,\n                    he put in a special plea and an affidavit for postponement; I, however, being\n                    conscious that I had done no wrong, came in for trial before your court.\n                        Theophemus, by bringing this testimony to\n                    which no one else has deposed, but only his brother and his brother-in-law, to\n                    the effect that he was willing to deliver up the woman, and by pretending to be\n                    a man without guile, deceived the jurors. But now I make of you a fair request,\n                    both to decide regarding the testimony whether it is true or false, and at the\n                    same time to consider the whole case from the beginning. I, for my part, hold that the proof should be drawn\n                    from the very course of procedure to which the fellow at that time fled for\n                    refuge, that is, from the examination of the woman by the torture, to determine\n                    which party struck the first blow; for this is what constitutes assault. And it\n                    is for this reason that I am suing the witnesses for false testimony, because\n                    they deposed that Theophemus was willing to deliver up the woman, whereas he\n                    never would produce her in person either at that time before the arbitrator or\n                    subsequently, despite my repeated demands. They ought, therefore, to suffer a double punishment, both because they\n                    deceived the jurors by bringing forward false testimonythat of the\n                    brother-in-law and the brother, and because they wronged me while I\n                    was zealously performing a public service, doing what the state commanded me,\n                    and obeying your laws and your decrees.Now to\n                    prove to you that I was not the only one thus commissioned, when I received from\n                    the magistrates the name of this man with orders to exact from him the equipment\n                    which he owed to the state, but that others of the trierarchs took such measures\n                    against others whose names they had received, read, please, their\n                        depositions.\n                    I wish now, men\n                    of the jury, to set forth before you the treatment with which I have met at\n                    their hands. For when I had lost to them the suit in which the witnesses gave\n                    the false testimony for which I am suing them, and the time for paying the\n                    judgement was about to expire, I came up to Theophemus and begged him to oblige\n                    me by waiting a little while, telling him what was true, that although I had got\n                    together the money which I was going to pay him, a trierarchy had fallen to my\n                    lot, and it was necessary to despatch the\n                    trireme with all speed, and that Alcimachus, the general, had ordered me to\n                    furnish this ship for his own use; the money, therefore, which I had got\n                    together to pay Theophemus, I had to use up for this purpose. So I asked him to\n                    extend the time of payment until I should have sent off the ship. And he\n                    answered me quite readily and guilelessly: There is no objection to\n                    that, he said, but, when you shall have despatched the\n                    ship, also bring the money to me. When Theophemus had given me this answer and had extended the time of payment,\n                    and especially because I relied upon my impeachment for false testimony and his\n                    unwillingness to deliver up the woman, and so thought he would take no violent\n                    measures in my affair, I despatched the trireme, and a few days later, having\n                    got the money together, I approached him and bade him to go with me to the bank\n                    to receive the amount of his judgement.To prove\n                    that I am speaking the truth in this, the clerk shall read you the depositions\n                    regarding these matters.\n                    Theophemus,\n                    however, instead of going with me to the bank and receiving the amount of his\n                    judgement, went and seized fifty soft-woolled sheep of mine that were grazing\n                    and with them the shepherd and all that belonged to the flock, and also a\n                    serving-boy who was carrying back a bronze pitcher of great value which was not\n                    ours, but had been borrowed. And they were not content with having these, but\n                    went on to my farm I have a piece of\n                    land near the Hippodrome, and have lived there since my boyhood, and\n                    first they made a rush to seize the household slaves, but since these escaped\n                    them and got off one here and another there, they went to the house, and\n                    bursting open the gate which led into the garden these were this man\n                    Evergus, the brother of Theophemus, and Mnesibulus, his brother-in-law, who had\n                    won no judgement against me, and who had no right to touch anything that was\n                    minethese men, I say, entered into the presence of my wife and\n                    children and carried off all the furniture that was still left in the house.\n                        They thought to get, not so much merely,\n                    but far more, for they expected to find the stock of household furniture which I\n                    formerly had; but because of my public services and taxes and my liberality\n                    toward you, some of the furniture is lying in pawn, and some has been sold. All\n                    that was left, however, they took away with them. More than this, men of the jury, my wife happened to be lunching\n                    with the children in the court and with her was an elderly woman who had been my\n                    nurse, a devoted soul and a faithful, who had been set free by my father. After\n                    she had been given her freedom she lived with her husband, but after his death,\n                    when she herself was an old woman and there was nobody to care for her, she came\n                    back to me. I could not suffer my old nurse,\n                    or the slave who attended me as a boy, to live in want; at the same time I was\n                    about to sail as trierarch and it was my wife's wish that I should leave such a\n                    person to live in the house with her. They were lunching in the court when these\n                    men burst in and found them there, and began to seize the furniture. The rest of\n                    the female slaves they were in a tower room where they live,\n                    when they heard the tumult, closed the door leading to the tower, so the men did\n                    not get in there; but they carried off the furniture from the rest of the house,\n                    although my wife forbade them to touch it, and\n                    declared that it was her property, mortgaged to secure her marriage portion; she\n                    said to them also, You have the fifty sheep, the serving boy, and the\n                    shepherd, whose value is in excess of the amount of your judgement\n                    for one of the neighbors knocked at the door and told her\n                    this. Furthermore she told them that the money was lying at the bank\n                    for them, for she had heard me say so. And, if you will wait\n                    here, she said, or if one of you will go after him, you\n                    shall take the money back with you at once; but let the furniture alone, and do\n                    not carry off anything that is mineespecially since you have the full\n                    value of your judgement. But\n                    although my wife spoke in this way, they not only did not desist, but when the\n                    nurse took the cup which was set by her and from which she had been drinking,\n                    and put it in her bosom to prevent these men from taking it, when she saw that\n                    they were in the house, Theophemus and Evergus, this brother of his, observing\n                    her, treated her so roughly in taking the cup from her that her arms and wrists were covered with blood, as they wrenched\n                    her arms and pulled her this way and that in taking the cup from her, and she\n                    had lacerations on her throat, where they strangled her, and her breast was\n                    black and blue. And they pushed their brutality to such extremes, that they did\n                    not stop throttling and beating the old woman, until they had taken the cup from\n                    her bosom. The servants of the neighbors,\n                    hearing the tumult and seeing that my house was being pillaged, some of them\n                    called from the roofs of their own houses to the people passing by, and others\n                    went into the other street and seeing Hagnophilus passing by, bade him to come.\n                    Hagnophilus, when he came up, summoned by a servant of Anthemion, who is a\n                    neighbor of mine, did not enter the house for he thought he ought not\n                    to do so in the absence of the master, but, standing on Anthemion's\n                    land, saw the furniture being carried off and Evergus and Theophemus coming out\n                    of the house. And not only did they go off\n                    with my furniture, men of the jury, but they were even on the point of taking\n                    away my son, as though he were a slave, until Hermogenes, one of my neighbors,\n                    met them and told them that he was my son.To\n                    prove that I am speaking the truth in this, the clerk shall read you the\n                        depositions.\n                    When, then, the\n                    news of what had been done was brought me in Peiraeus by the neighhors, I went\n                    to the farm, but found that these men had left; I saw, however, that the\n                    household goods had been carried off and in what plight the old woman was. My\n                    wife told me what had taken place, so, early next morning, I approached\n                    Theophemus in the city, having witnesses with me, and demanded, first that he\n                    accept payment of the amount of his judgement, and go with me to the bank, then,\n                    that he should provide for the care of the old woman whom they had beaten,\n                    calling in any physician whom they pleased. While I was saying this and solemnly protesting against their actions, they\n                    abused me roundly; then Theophemus went with me very reluctantly and making much\n                    delay, alleging that he too wished to take witnesses along with him\n                    this talk was a trick on his part to gain time; but this\n                    fellow Evergus went at once from the city in company with some others of like\n                    stamp to the farm. The furniture which I had remainingsome few pieces\n                    which the day before happened to be in the tower and not outsidehad,\n                    after I came home, necessarily been brought down, and Evergus, forcing open the\n                    gate which they had broken down the day before, and which was scarcely fastened,\n                    carried off my furnitureEvergus, to whom I owed no judgement, and\n                    with whom I had had no business transaction whatever. On my making full payment to Theophemus to whom I owed the\n                    judgement, when I had paid him in the presence of many witnesses eleven hundred\n                    drachmae, the amount of the judgement, one hundred and eighty-three drachmae two\n                    obols for the fine of one-sixth of that sum, and thirty drachmae for court fees\n                    I owed him nothing in the way of other\n                    penaltieswhen, I say, he had received from me at the bank\n                    one thousand three hundred and thirteen drachmae two obols, the total amount, on\n                    my demanding the return of the sheep and the slaves and the furniture of which\n                    he had robbed me, he declared that he would not return them to me unless I\n                    should release him and his associates from all claims, and the witnesses from\n                    the suit for false testimony. When he had\n                    given me this reply, I called upon those present to be witnesses to his answer,\n                    but I paid him the judgement, for I did not think it best to he in default. As\n                    for Evergus, I did not know that he had gone to my house on that day, but as\n                    soon as the judgement had been paid, while Theophemus still had the sheep and\n                    the slaves and the furniture, a stone-cutter, who was working on the monument\n                    near by, came to bring me word that Evergus had carried off from the house the\n                    rest of my furniturethat, namely, which had remained untouched the\n                    day before,Evergus, with whom I had nothing whatever to do.\n                        To prove\n                    that I am speaking the truth, that on the day before they had taken from me\n                    goods as security, and that the next day they recovered the money from me\n                    and yet, if the money had not been got together and I had not given\n                    them notice, how, pray, could they have secured immediate payment?,\n                    and that on that very day they had gone again into the house, while I was paying\n                    the moneyto prove all this, the clerk shall read you the\n                        depositions.\n                    Since, then,\n                    men of the jury, he paid no heed, when I served notice on him to care for the\n                    woman whom they had beaten and to bring in a physician, I myself brought in one\n                    with whom I had had dealings for many years, and he cared for her during her\n                    illness. I showed him the plight she was in, and brought witnesses. Hearing from\n                    the physician that the woman's condition was hopeless, I again took other\n                    witnesses, and pointing out the condition she was in served notice on these men\n                    to care for her. On the sixth day after these men had come into the house the\n                    nurse died.To prove that I am speaking the truth\n                    in this, the clerk shall read you the depositions bearing upon these\n                        matters.\n                    Well then,\n                    after her death I went to the Interpreters in order to learn what I ought to do in the\n                    matter, and I related to them all that had taken place: the coming of these men,\n                    the devotion of the woman, why it was that I kept her in my house, and that she\n                    had met her end because she would not surrender the cup. When the Interpreters\n                    had heard all this from me, they asked me whether they should interpret the law\n                    for me and nothing more, or should also advise me. On my answering them, Both, they said to me,\n                    Very well, we will interpret for you the law, and also give you\n                    advice to your profit. In the first place, if there be anyone related to the\n                    woman, let him carry a spear when she is borne forth to the tomb and make solemn\n                    proclamation at the tomb, and thereafter let him guard the tomb for the space of\n                    three days. And this is the advice which we give you: since you were not\n                    yourself present, but only your wife and your children, and since you have no\n                    other witnesses, we advise you not to make proclamation against anyone by name,\n                    but in general against the perpetrators and the murderers; and again not to institute suit before the king. For that course is not open to you under the law,\n                    since the woman is not a relative of yours nor yet a servant, according to your\n                    own statement; and it is to relatives or to masters that the law appoints the\n                    duty of prosecuting. If, then, you should take the oath at the Palladium, yourself\n                    and your wife and your children, and imprecate curses upon yourselves and your\n                    house, you will lose the goodwill of many, and if your opponent is acquitted,\n                    you will be thought to have committed perjury, and if you convict him, you will\n                    he an object of malice. No, after you have performed the proper religious rites\n                    to cleanse yourself and your house, bear your misfortune with such patience as\n                    you can, and, if you choose, avenge yourself in some other way.\n                        When I had\n                    received this advice from the Interpreters and had looked at the laws of Draco\n                    on the inscribed slab, I consulted with my friends as to what course of action I\n                    should pursue. As they gave me the same advice, I did what was necessary to\n                    purify the house and what the Interpreters had prescribed, and abstained from\n                    further action which the laws forbade. For the\n                    law, men of the jury, ordains that prosecution shall be by relatives within the\n                    degree of children of cousins; and that in the oath inquiry shall be made as to\n                    what the relationship is, even if the victim be a servant; and it is from these\n                    persons that criminal actions shall proceed. But the woman was in no way related\n                    to me by blood, she had only been my nurse; nor again was she a servant; for she\n                    had been set free by my father, and she lived in a separate house, and had taken\n                    a husband. Now, to tell a false story to you\n                    and support it by an oath with imprecations on myself, my son, and my wife, was\n                    a thing I dared not do, even if I knew well that I should convict these men; for\n                    I do not hate them as much as I love myself.But\n                    that you may hear this not merely from my own lips, the clerk shall read you the\n                    law itself.\n                    I fancy, men of\n                    the jury, that it has become clear to you on many grounds that the deposition is\n                    false, but that you see it most readily from the conduct of the men themselves.\n                    For they thought, men of the jury, that, if they took a large quantity of goods\n                    from me as security, I should be glad to release the witnesses from the charge\n                    of false testimony in order to get back the goods. And when I asked Theophemus to oblige me by extending the time of\n                    payment, he was glad to comply in order that I might be in default, and that he\n                    might carry off as many goods as possible. It was for this reason that he\n                    acceded to my request so guilelessly and so promptly in order to win my\n                    confidence and keep me from seeing his plot; for he thought it was not possible\n                    for him in any other way to get the witnesses released from the charge of false\n                    testimony than by tricking me, catching me in default and carrying off as many\n                    goods as possible; for he expected to get, not only what they actually have of\n                    mine, but a great deal more. And he waited the\n                    rest of the time, thinking that I should not quickly get the money together, and\n                    wishing to seize the goods as security just when the trial for false testimony\n                    was coming on; but when I served notice on him to come and collect the amount of\n                    the judgement, he went and seized my furniture and slaves and sheep instead of\n                    receiving payment. I till a farm near the Hippodrome, so that he did not have\n                    far to go. That what I am saying is true let\n                    this be a strong proof: he got the amount of the judgement the day after he\n                    seized the security. And yet, if I had not got the money together, how could he\n                    have got payment at once in cash, one thousand three hundred and thirteen\n                    drachmae two obols? And the goods which he had seized as security he refused to\n                    return to me, but up to this day he keeps them, as though I were in default. But\n                    to prove that I was not in default, read me the deposition and the law which\n                    ordains that all agreements entered into by the two parties shall be binding; I\n                    was, therefore, as you see, no longer in default to him.\n                    Well, then,\n                    that he consented and extended the time of payment has been established for you\n                    by witnesses, and that I was serving as trierarch my colleague in the trierarchy\n                    has testified, and also that the ship was equipped as flagship for the admiral\n                    Alcimachus. Surely, then, I was not in default to him when he had extended the\n                    time, especially since I paid the money in full. But the graspingness of his\n                    disposition, when it is a question of more or less, is dreadful, men of the\n                    jury. And they knew well that, if they should deliver up the woman for\n                    examination, it would be proved that their charge was false, while, if they\n                    should not deliver up the woman, whom the witnesses stated that Theophemus was\n                    willing to deliver up, they would be convicted of false testimony. I beg of you, men of the jury, if any one of those\n                    who then served as jurors happens to be in the court-room, to act upon the same\n                    principles as you did then; and, if the deposition seemed to you to be worthy of\n                    credence, and I seemed to shrink from the test which the examination of the\n                    woman would have afforded, now, when they are proved to have given false\n                    testimony and do not deliver up the woman, to come to my aid: and if you are\n                    angry with me because I went to the house of Theophemus to take security, to be\n                    angry now with these men also because they went to my house. And I, who was forced to go by the laws and the\n                    decrees, was careful not to make my way into the presence of the father or\n                    mother of Theophemus or to take anything belonging to his brother; but I went to\n                    where Theophemus lived by himself, and when I did not find him at home, I did\n                    not seize anything and carry it off, but bade someone fetch him, and I took the\n                    security in his presence and not in his absence; and when it was taken from me,\n                    I gave it up and betook myself to the senate, the proper authority, and when I\n                    had preferred my impeachment and had convicted him in the senate, I thought it\n                    enough merely to recover the ship's equipment, and to leave the matter of the\n                    assault to a referee, and to make a concession in the matter of the fine.\n                        I, then, was lenient toward these men,\n                    whereas they were so brutal and ruthless that they forced themselves into the\n                    presence of my wife and children, although they had in their possession the\n                    sheep and the slaves, of greater value than their judgement, and although they\n                    had given me an extension of time and I had given them notice to come and\n                    recover their judgement, as has been proved to you by testimony. They came to my\n                    house and not only carried off the furniture, but beat the nurse, an old woman,\n                    for the sake of a cup; and they keep possession of all these things, and refuse\n                    to give them up, though I have paid in full the amount of the judgement, one\n                    thousand three hundred and thirteen drachmae two obols. If anyone through ignorance thought these men at the\n                    time of the former trial to be guileless and inoffensive persons, I wish to read\n                    you the depositions regarding them which have been furnished me by those whom\n                    they have wronged for the water in the clock is not sufficient to\n                    permit me to tell the whole story in my speech, in order that, when\n                    you have considered the case in the light of all these things, both the\n                    arguments and the testimony, the verdict which you will render may be such as\n                    piety and justice demand of you.Read the\n                        depositions."}}, {"@type": "speech", "@n": "48", "head": "Against Olympiodorus", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "13"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "14"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "15"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "16"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "17"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "18"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "19"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "21"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "22"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "23"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "24"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "25"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "26"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "27"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "28"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "29"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "30"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "31"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "32"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "33"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "34"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "35"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "36"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "37"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "38"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "39"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "40"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "41"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "42"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "43"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "44"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "45"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "46"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "47"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "48"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "49"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "50"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "51"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "52"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "53"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "54"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "55"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "56"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "57"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "58"}], "quote": [{"@type": "Depositions", "title": "Depositions"}, {"@type": "Law", "title": "Law"}, {"@type": "Deposition", "title": "Deposition"}, {"@type": "Law", "title": "Law"}, {"@type": "Deposition", "title": "Deposition"}, {"@type": "Challenge", "title": "Challenge"}, {"@type": "Deposition", "title": "Deposition"}, {"@type": "Deposition", "title": "Deposition"}, {"@type": "Deposition", "title": "Deposition"}, {"@type": "Deposition", "title": "Deposition"}], "note": [{"@resp": "Loeb", "@anchored": "yes", "#text": "There were two demes of\n                        this name, one on the east coast of Attica and the other on the Saronic\n                        Gulf.

For, although I have been unwilling, men of the jury, to go to law with\n                    Olympiodorus, who is a relative of mine and whose sister is my wife, I have been\n                    forced to do so because of the magnitude of the wrongs which he has done me.\n                        If I were entering upon this course, men of\n                    the jury, without having been wronged, or were trumping up a false charge\n                    against Olympiodorus, or if I were unwilling to refer the matter to men who are\n                    friends both of Olympiodorus and myself, or if I were refusing to adopt any\n                    other fair course of action, be assured that I should be thoroughly ashamed, and\n                    should think myself a worthless sort of fellow: but as it is, the loss I have\n                    suffered at the hands of Olympiodorus is no small one; I have not refused to\n                    accept any referee, and I swear by Zeus the Supreme that it is not willingly,\n                    but with the utmost possible reluctance, that I have been forced by the\n                    defendant to bring this suit. I beg of you,\n                    therefore, men of the jury, when you have heard us both and have sifted the\n                    matter for yourselves, preferably to find some settlement of our quarrel and\n                    dismiss us, and thus become benefactors of us both; but if you cannot succeed in\n                    this, of the courses remaining open to you, I beg you to give your vote to him\n                    whose plea is just.First, then, the clerk shall\n                    read to you the depositions which show that it is not I who am responsible for\n                    bringing the case into court, but the defendant himself.Read the depositions.\n                    That I offered\n                    reasonable and fitting terms to Olympiodorus has been testified to you, men of\n                    the jury, by those who were present. Since, however, he does not choose to do\n                    anything that is right, it is necessary for me to set forth before you the\n                    matters in which I have been wronged by him. But the story is a short one.\n                        There was a\n                    certain Comon of Halae, men\n                    of the, jury, a relative of ours. This Comon died without issue after a very\n                    short illness; he had lived, however, many years, and was an old man when he\n                    died. When I saw that he could not possibly recover, I sent for the defendant\n                    Olympiodorus that he might be with us, and join with us in taking all proper\n                    measures. And Olympiodorus, when he had come to me and to my wife, who is his\n                    own sister, aided us in making all the arrangements. While we were thus occupied, this fellow Olympiodorus suddenly flung\n                    at me the statement that his mother also was related to Comon, the dead man, and\n                    that it was fair that he, too, should receive his share of all the property\n                    which Comon left. I for my part, men of the jury, as I knew that he was lying\n                    and trying to put a bold face on it, and that there was nobody else nearer of\n                    kin to Comon than myself, became at first exceedingly wroth and indignant at the\n                    shamelessness of his claim; presently, however, I reflected that it was not a\n                    proper time for anger, and I made answer to him, that for the present it was our\n                    duty to bury the dead man and do all else that custom called for, and that after\n                    we should have discharged all these duties we would talk with one another.\n                        And Olympiodorus, men of the jury, assented\n                    to this, and said that I was quite right. So when we had finished all this, and\n                    had done all that custom required, we called in all our relatives and quietly\n                    discussed with one another the claims which this fellow advanced. Now, men of\n                    the jury, why should I weary you or myself by relating the various differences\n                    which arose between us as we talked these matters over? The conclusion to which we came, however, it is\n                    necessary for you to hear. I myself reached the decision regarding his claims,\n                    and he regarding mine, that we should each take half of what Comon left, and\n                    there should be no further unpleasantness between us. I chose, men of the jury,\n                    voluntarily to share the inheritance with him rather than come into court and\n                    risk a trial with the fellow, who is a relative, and to say unpleasant things of\n                    one who is a brother of my wife and the uncle of my children, and hear\n                    disagreeable things from him. Thinking of all\n                    these things I came to terms with him.After this\n                    we drew up written articles of agreement regarding all matters involved, and\n                    swore solemn oaths to one another that we would in very truth divide fairly and\n                    honestly all the visible property that there was, and that neither of us would\n                    in any respect take advantage of the other in regard to Comon's estate; that we\n                    would make joint inquiry for the rest, and would act in common in forming\n                    whatever plans should from time to time be necessary. For we suspected, men of the jury, that others besides ourselves\n                    would come to lay claim to the estate of Comon. For instance, there was my\n                    brother, on my father's but not my mother's side, who was out of the country;\n                    and, if anyone else wished to put in a claim, there was no way for us to prevent\n                    it; for the laws ordain that anyone who chooses may put in a claim. Foreseeing\n                    all these contingencies, we drew up our articles of agreement and swore our\n                    oaths in order that neither of us might have the opportunity of doing anything\n                    whatever independently, whether he should wish to do so or not, but that we\n                    should do everything by mutual agreement. And\n                    we called to witness this agreement, first the gods in whose name we exchanged\n                    our oaths, and our own relatives, and moreover Androcleides of Acharnae, with whom we deposited the articles.I wish now, men of the jury, to read the law in\n                    accordance with which we drew up our agreement, and deposition of the person who\n                    has the articles in his keeping.Read the law\n                        first.Now read the deposition of\n                        Androcleides.\n                    When we had\n                    exchanged oaths, and the articles had been deposited with Androcleides, I\n                    divided the property into two shares, men of the jury. One share consisted of\n                    the house in which Comon himself had lived, and the slaves engaged in weaving\n                    sackcloth, and the other of another house and the slaves engaged in grinding\n                    colors. Whatever ready money Comon left in the bank of Heracleides had been\n                    nearly all spent on his burial and the other funeral rites, and on the building\n                    of his tomb. And after I had divided the\n                    property into these two shares, I gave Olympiodorus his choice to take whichever\n                    of the two shares he pleased; and he chose the color-grinders and the small\n                    house, while I took the weavers and the dwelling-house. This is what each of us had. Now in the share of this\n                    fellow Olympiodorus there was a man, one of the color-grinders, whom Comon used\n                    to regard as most faithful to himself; the man's name was Moschion. This slave\n                    had a pretty good knowledge of all Comon's other affairs, and in particular knew\n                    where the money was which Comon kept in the house; and Comon, who was oldish and who had confidence in him, was unaware\n                    that this slave Moschion was stealing his money. He first stole from him one\n                    thousand drachmae, which sum was kept separate from the rest of the money, and\n                    afterwards seventy minae more. He was doing this without Comon's suspecting it,\n                    and the fellow kept all this money in his own possession. Soon after we had\n                    divided the shares between us, men of the jury, we became suspicious, and found\n                    out something about this money; and as a result of this suspicion Olympiodorus\n                    here and I decided to put the man to the torture. And the fellow, men of the\n                    jury, before he was put to the torture, voluntarily confessed that he had stolen\n                    a thousand drachmae from Comon, and said that he still had in his quarters all\n                    the money which had not been spent; but of the larger sum he did not say a word\n                    at that time. So he paid back about six\n                    hundred drachmae. And of this sum which the man paid back we made a just and\n                    fair division in accordance with the oaths which we had sworn and the agreement\n                    deposited with Androcleides, I taking one half and the defendant Olympiodorus\n                    the other. Not\n                    long after this, as a result of the suspicion against the slave in regard to the\n                    money, the defendant had the man bound and again put to the torture. He did this\n                    independently by himself without calling me in, although he had sworn to make\n                    all inquiries and do everything in concert with me. And the fellow, men of the\n                    jury, when racked by the torture made further confession that he had stolen from\n                    Comon the seventy minae; and he restored this entire sum to the defendant\n                    Olympiodorus. I, on my part, men of the jury,\n                    when I learned that the man had been tortured, and that he had restored the\n                    money, supposed that Olympiodorus would pay me half the amount, just as he had\n                    before paid me half of the one thousand drachmae. At first I did not press him,\n                    thinking that he would recognize his obligation and arrange matters for my\n                    interest and his own, so that each of us should have what was fair in accordance\n                    with our oaths and our mutual agreement to share equally in all that Comon left;\n                        but since he delayed, and did nothing, I\n                    had a talk with this man Olympiodorus, and demanded that I receive my share of\n                    the money. But Olympiodorus here kept finding one excuse after another, and\n                    putting me off. Moreover, at this very time some other people filed claims to\n                    the estate of Comon, and Callippus, my brother on my father's side, returned\n                    from abroad; and he too filed a claim for half the estate. So Olympiodorus found in this another excuse for not\n                    paying me the money, since there were many who were laying claim to the estate;\n                    and he said that I must wait until the suits were settled. And I had to consent\n                    to this, and I did consent. After this the defendant Olympiodorus and I took counsel\n                    together, as we had sworn to do, to determine the best and safest way to deal\n                    with the other claimants. And we decided, men of the jury, that the defendant\n                    Olympiodorus should lay claim to the whole estate, and that,I should claim a\n                    half, seeing that my brother Callippus claimed a half only. When all the claims had been heard before the archon,\n                    and the cases were due to be tried in court, the defendant Olympiodorus and I\n                    were wholly unprepared for an immediate trial because those who had suddenly\n                    appeared as claimants were so many. However, in view of the situation that had\n                    developed, we looked into things jointly to see if in any way a postponement\n                    could be brought about for the present, so that we might get ourselves ready for\n                    the trial at our leisure. And it happened by a\n                    piece of good luck that you were persuaded by the politicians to despatch troops\n                    into Acarnania, and the defendant\n                    Olympiodorus was among those called to service, and he departed with the others\n                    on the expedition. Thus had come about, as we thought, an excellent ground for\n                    postponement, the defendant being abroad on military service. So, when the archon summoned into court all those who\n                    were filing claims according to law, I entered a sworn statement, asking\n                    postponement on the ground that the defendant Olympiodorus was abroad on\n                    military service, but to this sworn statement our adversaries opposed another,\n                    attacking Olympiodorus; and as they had the last word, they induced the jurors\n                    to decide that the defendant was absent on account of the trial and not on\n                    public service. When the jurors had thus\n                    decided, the archon Pythodotus in accordance with the law\n                    struck out the claim of the defendant; and when this claim was stricken out I\n                    necessarily had to abandon my claim to half the estate. After these steps had\n                    been taken, the archon adjudged the estate of Comon to our opponents; for the\n                    laws compelled him to do so. They, as soon as\n                    they had won the adjudication, went at once to the Peiraeus and proceeded to\n                    take over all that either of us had received from the division. I, being at\n                    home, voluntarily gave over to them what I had for it was necessary to\n                    obey the laws, but since Olympiodorus was abroad, they carried off all\n                    his effects except the money which he had separately taken from the\n                    manthe slave whom he had put to the torture; for they had no means of\n                    getting hold of that money. Such were the events which happened in the absence of\n                    Olympiodorus, and such the benefit I derived from my association with him. But\n                    when he returned with the rest of the troops, the defendant Olympiodorus was\n                    indignant, men of the jury, at what had occurred, and thought he had been\n                    outrageously treated. However, when he was at the height of his indignation, we\n                    again looked matters over, the defendant Olympiodorus and I, and took counsel\n                    together to see how we could get back something of what we had lost. And as a result of our consultation we decided to\n                    summon into court in due legal form those who had had the property adjudged to\n                    them; and in the circumstances it seemed to be the safest course not to risk a\n                    joint suit against the other claimants, but for each to act separately; and for\n                    the defendant Olympiodorus to enter suit for the whole estate as he had done\n                    before, and conduct his case by himself, and for me to enter suit for a half,\n                    since my brother Callippus claimed the half only; so that, if Olympiodorus should win his case, I, in accordance with\n                    our agreement and our oaths, might recover my share from him, while, if he\n                    should lose it and the jurors give an adverse verdict, he might fairly and\n                    honestly recover his share from me in accordance with our oaths and the\n                    agreement made between us. After we had reached this conclusion, and it seemed\n                    safest both for Olympiodorus and for me, all those who were in possession of the\n                    estate of Comon were summoned according to law.Read, please, the law in accordance with which the summons was given.\n                    It was in\n                    accordance with this law, men of the jury, that the summons was given, and that\n                    we filed our counter-claims in the manner approved by Olympiodorus. After this\n                    the archon conducted the preliminary examination for all claimants, and when he\n                    had concluded this he brought the case into court. The defendant Olympiodorus\n                    was the first to plead, and he said whatever he pleased and offered whatever\n                    testimony he saw fit, while I, men of the jury, sat in silence on the opposite\n                    platform. Since the trial had been fixed in this way, Olympiodorus easily won\n                    his case; but when he had got the verdict and\n                    we had accomplished in the court-room all that we wished, when he had recovered\n                    from those who had previously won the adjudication all that they had taken from\n                    us,although he has all this now in his possession as well as the\n                    money which he got from the slave who was put to the torture, he has refused to\n                    do anything whatever that is fair toward me, but keeps everything himself, even\n                    though he has given his oath and made an agreement with me that in very truth we\n                    should take equal shares. These articles of agreement are still up to this day\n                    in the custody of Androcleides, who has himself given testimony before you.\n                        I wish, however, to bring before you\n                    depositions proving all the other statements I have made, but first of all, to\n                    prove that at the outset the defendant and I, having settled our differences by\n                    ourselves, took each an equal share of all the property left by Comon of which\n                    we had knowledge.Take, please, this deposition\n                    first, and then read all the rest.\n                    Now, please\n                    take the challenge which I tendered him regarding the money which he got from\n                    the slave who was put to the torture.Read now the other deposition, too,\n                    proving that, when our opponents had received the adjudication, they took from\n                    us all that we had except the money which Olympiodorus got from the man who was\n                    put to the torture.\n                    In what way,\n                    men of the jury, Olympiodorus and I originally divided between us the visible\n                    estate of Comon, you have both heard from my statement, and it has been proved\n                    to you by witnesses; and you have also learned that the defendant got the sum of\n                    money from the slave, and that those who had previously won the adjudication\n                    took all that was in our possession, until Olympiodorus won a verdict in the\n                    second trial. Now hear the reason which he\n                    gives for not paying me what is due, and for refusing to do anything whatever\n                    that is fair; and to this, men of the jury, I bid you give close heed, in order\n                    that you may not be misled presently by the orators whom he has engaged against\n                        me.This defendant never says the same thing,\n                    but one thing now and another then, just as it happens. He goes about bringing\n                    forward absurd excuses, baseless insinuations, and false charges, and acts in\n                    the whole business as a man of bad faith. Hosts of people have heard him say, sometimes that he never got the money from\n                    the slave at all; but again, when the contrary has been proved, he says that he\n                    got the money from his own slave, and that he will give me no share of this\n                    money or of anything else of the estate which Comon left. And when anyone of our common friends asks him why he\n                    refuses to pay me, when he has sworn to share everything equally and when the\n                    articles of agreement are still in custody, he asserts that I have broken the\n                    agreement and have treated him outrageously, and he states that I have all along\n                    been speaking and acting in opposition to him. These are the excuses he offers.\n                        The statements which the fellow makes, men\n                    of the jury, are insinuations which he has himself made up, false excuses, and\n                    bits of trickery, got up with a view to defrauding me of what he ought to pay\n                    me. But what I shall say to you to prove that he is lying will be no mere\n                    insinuation on the contrary I shall prove in glaring fashion his shamelessness,\n                    advancing proofs that are trustworthy and known to everybody, and bringing\n                    forward witnesses regarding every point. In the first place, men of the jury, I say\n                    that the defendant refused to refer our differences to our common friends and\n                    relatives who had full knowledge of all the circumstances of the case, and had\n                    followed them from the beginning; for this reason, that he had full knowledge\n                    that if he made use of any falsehoods, he would be refuted by them on the spot,\n                    whereas he thinks that now he may perhaps lie before you without being detected.\n                        Again I say, it is not consistent,\n                    Olympiodorus, that I should act in opposition to you, and yet should join with\n                    you in expending whatever from time to time became necessary, or that I should\n                    myself voluntarily abandon my claim, when you were abroad and your claim was\n                    stricken off because it was thought that you were absent on account of the trial\n                    and not on public service. For it was open to me to press my own claim for\n                    one-half the estate; no human being opposed my claim, but my opponents\n                    themselves allowed it. However, had I done\n                    this, I should by that very act have perjured myself, for I had sworn and\n                    contracted with you to do in concert with you whatever should seem to us on\n                    consultation to be best. Therefore the pretexts and charges on which you base\n                    your refusal to act fairly toward me are absolutely silly. And furthermoredo you suppose,\n                    Olympiodorus, that in the last trial for the estate I should have permitted you\n                    either to utter so recklessly the statements which you made to the jury, or to\n                    bring forward witnesses as you did regarding the points you wished to prove, if\n                    I had not been acting in concert with you in the trial? For the fellow, men of the jury, said everything else\n                    that he pleased in the court-room, and emphatically stated to the jurymen that I\n                    had rented from him the house which I received as part of my share, and that I\n                    had borrowed of him the money which I receivedthe half, that is, of\n                    the thousand drachmae recovered from the slave. And he not only made these\n                    statements, but he produced depositions to support them. And I said nothing\n                    whatever against all this, nor did any human being hear a syllable aloud or\n                    muttered from me while he was supporting his claim, but I admitted the truth of\n                    everything he chose to say. For I was cooperating with you, Olympiodorus,\n                    according to our agreement. If what I am\n                    saying is not true, why did I not proceed against the witnesses who gave this\n                    evidence instead of keeping absolute silence? Or why did you, Olympiodorus,\n                    never sue me for the rent of the house which you alleged was your own and had\n                    been rented by you to me; or for the money which you told the jurymen you had\n                    lent me? Why, I say, did you do neither of these things? How, then, could any\n                    man be more clearly convicted than you have been of lying, of making\n                    contradictory statements, and of preferring charges that lack all foundation?\n                        But here is\n                    the strongest proof of all, which will convince you, men of the jury, of his bad\n                    faith and covetousness. If there were any truth in what he says, he should have\n                    stated it and proved it before the trial came on, and before he tested the jury\n                    as to how it would decide; and he should have taken a number of witnesses and\n                    demanded that the articles of agreement be taken from the custody of\n                    Androcleides on the ground that I was violating them, and acting against his\n                    interests, and that the articles were no longer in force between him and me;\n                    also he should have protested to Androcleides, who had the articles in his\n                    possession, that he had no longer anything to do with these articles. This is what he should have done, men of the jury, if\n                    there were any truth in what he says; he should have gone by himself to\n                    Androcleides, and made this protest, and gone also with many witnesses, in order\n                    that he might have many persons who were aware of the fact.But to prove that he never took any of these steps, the clerk\n                    shall read you the deposition of Androcleides himself with whom the articles of\n                    agreement are deposited.Read the\n                        deposition.\n                    Now, men of the\n                    jury, you must consider another thing which he has done. I tendered him a\n                    challenge, and demanded that he go with me to Androcleides, with whom the\n                    articles are deposited, and that we should jointly make copies of the agreement\n                    and seal it up again, but that we should put the copies in the evidence-box, in\n                    order that there might be no ground for suspicion, but that you might hear\n                    everything plainly and fairly, and then vote as should seem to you most just.\n                        I tendered him this challenge, but he\n                    refused to do anything of the sort; no, he has tried thus artfully to prevent\n                    your hearing the agreement from copies jointly made.To prove that I tendered him this challenge, the clerk shall\n                    read you the deposition of the persons in whose presence I tendered it. Read the\n                        deposition.\n                    How, then,\n                    could it be made more plain that the fellow is unwilling to act justly toward me\n                    in any way, that he thinks to rob me of what I ought to receive by advancing\n                    excuses and preferring charges, and that he determined that you should not hear\n                    the agreement which he asserts I have broken? But I challenged him then before\n                    the witnesses who were present, and I challenge him again now before you\n                    jurymen, and I demand that he consent, and I myself do consent, to have the\n                    articles of agreement opened here in the court-room, to let you hear them, and\n                    to have them sealed up again in your presence. Androcleides is present here; for I gave him notice to come and bring the\n                    articles of agreement. I consent, men of the jury, that they be opened during\n                    the defendant's speech, in either his first or his second, it makes no\n                    difference to me. But I wish you to hear the agreement and the oaths which\n                    Olympiodorus the defendant and I swore to one another. If he consents, let this\n                    be done, and do you hear for yourselves the articles when he shall see fit; and\n                    if he refuses to take this course, will it not be plain without further proof,\n                    men of the jury, that he is the most shameless of humankind, and that you may\n                    rightly refuse to accept as true anything whatever that he says? But why am I so\n                    earnest in urging this? The defendant himself knows well that he has sinned\n                    against me and sinned against the gods in whose name he swore, and that he is a\n                    perjurer. But something has deranged him, men of the jury, and he is not in his\n                    senses. I am pained and I feel shame, men of the jury, at what I am about to\n                    tell you, but I am forced to tell it, in order that you, in whose hands the\n                    verdict lies, may hear all the facts before you reach the conclusion regarding\n                    us which may seem to you best. For my\n                    mentioning the things which I am about to tell you this fellow is himself to\n                    blame, since he refused to settle our differences among our relatives, but chose\n                    to brazen the matter out. For you must know, men of the jury, that this fellow\n                    Olympiodorus has never married an Athenian woman in accordance with your laws;\n                    he has no children nor has ever had any, but he keeps in his house a mistress\n                    whose freedom he had purchased, and it is she who is the ruin of us all and who\n                    drives the man on to a higher pitch of madness. Is it not indeed a proof of his madness that he refuses to do anything\n                    whatever that was stipulated in the agreement which was entered into with his\n                    full consent and with my own, and which was confirmed by an\n                    oath?especially when I am striving, not in my own interest only, but\n                    in the interest of her to whom I am married, his own sister, born of the same\n                    father and the same mother, and in the interest of his niece, my daughter. For\n                    they are being wronged not less than I, but even more. Can anyone, indeed, say that they are not wronged and are not\n                    suffering outrageous treatment, when they see this fellow's mistress, in\n                    defiance of all decency, decked out with masses of jewels and with fine raiment,\n                    going abroad in splendid state and flaunting the luxury purchased with what is\n                    ours, while they are themselves too poor to enjoy such things? Are they not\n                    suffering a wrong even greater than my own? And in adopting such a manner of\n                    life is not Olympiodorus not manifestly mad and beside himself?Now, that he may not claim, men of the jury, that I am speaking\n                    thus with a view to slandering him because of this suit, the clerk shall read\n                    you a deposition from his relatives and mine.\n                    The defendant\n                    Olympiodorus, then, is a person of this sort. He is not only dishonest, but in\n                    the opinion of all his relatives and friends is proved by the manner of life\n                    which he has adopted to be mentally deranged; to use the language of the\n                    lawgiver Solon, he is beside himself as no other man ever was, for he is under\n                    the influence of a woman who is a harlot. And Solon established a law that all acts shall be null and void which are done\n                    by anyone under the influence of a woman, especially of a woman of her stamp.\n                        In this matter the lawgiver made wise\n                    provision; and I entreat youand not I only, but my wife also, the\n                    sister of this Olympiodorus, and my daughter, his niece,we all beg and implore\n                    you, men of the jury, for I would have you imagine that these women\n                    are here present before you, if it\n                    be possible, to prevail upon this fellow Olympiodorus not to do us wrong, but if\n                    he refuses, and you cannot prevail upon him, then to bear in mind all that has\n                    been said and give whatever verdict shall seem to you best and most in\n                    accordance with justice. If you do this, you will reach a decision that is fair\n                    and one that is to the advantage of us all, and especially to the advantage of\n                    this fellow Olympiodorus himself."}}, {"@type": "speech", "@n": "49", "head": "Apollodorus Against Timotheus", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "13"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "14"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "15"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "16"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "17"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "18"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "19"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "21"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "22"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "23"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "24"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "25"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "26"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "27"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "28"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "29"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "30"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "31"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "32"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "33"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "34"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "35"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "36"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "37"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "38"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "39"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "40"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "41"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "42"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "43"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "44"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "45"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "46"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "47"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "48"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "49"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "50"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "51"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "52"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "53"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "54"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "55"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "56"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "57"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "58"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "59"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "60"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "61"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "62"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "63"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "64"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "65"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "66"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "67"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "68"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "69"}, {"@ed": "P", "@unit": "para"}], "note": [{"@resp": "Loeb", "@anchored": "yes", "bibl": {"@n": "Dem. 49.10", "#text": "Dem.\n                            49.10"}, "#text": "His treasurer, Antimachus, actually was condemned\n                        to death, and Timotheus himself was saved from a like fate only by the\n                        intercession of influential friends.

On the contrary, when I have\n                    called to your minds the occasion on which the loan was contracted and the\n                    events in which the defendant was at that time involved and the straits to which\n                    he was reduced, you will then hold that my father was most generous to\n                    Timotheus, and that the defendant is not only ungrateful, but is the most\n                    dishonest of humankind; for he got from my\n                    father all that he asked, and received from the bank money at a time when he was\n                    in great need and when he was in grievous danger of losing his life; yet he has not only made no return, but even seeks\n                    to rob me of the money which was granted him. And yet, if matters had gone badly\n                    with Timotheus, my father's money, too, was lost, for he lent it without\n                    security and without witnesses; but, if the defendant got off safe, it rested\n                    with him to choose when, having the funds available, he should pay us back.\n                        But for all that, men of the jury, my\n                    father did not count the holding of large sums of money as important a matter as\n                    to supply Timotheus with what he needed in the time of his distress. No, my\n                    father thought, men of the jury, that, if Timotheus then got safely out of those\n                    dangers and returned home from the service of the king, when the defendant was in better circumstances than\n                    at the time, he would not only recover his money, but would be in a position to\n                    obtain whatever else he might wish from Timotheus. But as matters have not turned out as my father expected, since the\n                    money which Timotheus asked of my father and gratefully received from the bank\n                    he is determined, now that my father is dead, to pay back only if forced to do\n                    so by hostile legal procedure, and by convincing proof of his indebtedness, and,\n                    if he can convince you by deceitful arguments that he is not liable, to rob us\n                    of the moneyI count it necessary to inform you fully of everything\n                    from the beginning: the several loans, the purpose for which he expended each\n                    sum, and the dates at which the obligations were contracted. And let no one of you wonder that I have accurate\n                    knowledge of these matters; for bankers are accustomed to write out memoranda of\n                    the sums which they lend, the purposes for which funds are desired, and the\n                    payments which a borrower makes, in order that his receipts and his payments may\n                    be known to them for their accounts. It was\n                    then, in the archonship of Socratidas, in the month Munichion, when the defendant Timotheus was about to sail on his second\n                    expedition and was already in the Peiraeus on the point of putting to sea, that,\n                    being in want of money, he came to my father in the port and urged him to lend\n                    him one thousand three hundred and fifty-one drachmae two obols, declaring that\n                    he needed that additional sum; and he bade him give the money to his treasurer\n                    Antimachus, who at that time managed everything for him. It was Timotheus who borrowed the money from my\n                    father, and who bade him give it to his treasurer Antimachus, but the one who\n                    received the money from Phormio at the bank was Autonomus, who throughout all\n                    that time served as secretary to Antimachus. When, therefore, the money was paid out, the bank recorded as debtor\n                    Timotheus, who had requested the loan, but made a memorandum in the name of\n                    Antimachus, to whom Timotheus had ordered the money to be paid, and also named\n                    Autonomus, whom Antimachus had sent to the bank to receive the money, the amount\n                    being one thousand three hundred and fifty-one drachmae two obols. The first\n                    loan, then, which Timotheus contracted at the time of his going to sea, when he\n                    was serving as general the second time, was for this amount. Again, when you had removed him from his command as\n                    general because he failed to sail round the Peloponnesus, and he had been given\n                    over to the popular assembly for trial under a very heavy charge, when he was\n                    being prosecuted by Callistratus and Iphicrates, men of power both in action\n                    and in speech, and they and their fellow-pleaders so influenced your minds by\n                    their accusations against him that you\n                    condemned and put to death Antimachus, his treasurer and a man most devoted to\n                    him,yes, and confiscated his property; while Timotheus himself,\n                    thanks to the intercession of all his friends and relatives, and also of Alcetas\n                    and Jason, who\n                    were allies of yours, you were reluctantly induced to pardon, but you deposed\n                    him from his command; such were the\n                    charges under which he lay, and he was in desperate need of money. For all his\n                    property had been mortgaged, pillars had been set up on it, and other people\n                    were in control. His farm in the plain had been taken over as security by the\n                    son of Eumelidas; the rest of his property was mortgaged, for seven minae each,\n                    to the sixty trierarchs who set out on the voyage with him, which money he as\n                    admiral had forced them to distribute among their crews for maintenance.\n                        When he was deposed, he reported in the\n                    account which he rendered, that he had at that time himself given those seven\n                    minae for the ships from the military fund, but, fearing lest the trierarchs\n                    should give evidence against him and he should be convicted of lying, he\n                    borrowed privately from each one of them seven minae, and gave them a mortgage\n                    on his property. Yet he is now seeking to rob them of this money, and he has dug\n                    up the pillars. He was hard pressed on every\n                    side, his life was in extreme danger because of the gravity of the misfortunes\n                    which had befallen the state, the army in Calaureia had been broken up for want of pay, the allies\n                    around Peloponnesus were being besieged by the Lacedaemonians, Iphicrates and\n                    Callistratus were accusing him of being responsible for the present disaster,\n                    and, furthermore, those who came from the army were reporting before the\n                    assembly the distress and need that existed, and at the same time individuals\n                    kept receiving word from their relatives and friends telling of their plight.\n                    These things you all heard in the popular assembly at that time, and you\n                    remember how each man of you felt toward him; you are not without knowledge of\n                    what people were saying. Well, then, when he\n                    was on the point of sailing home for his trial, the defendant, while still in\n                    Calaureia, borrowed from Antiphanes of Lamptrae, who sailed with Philip\n                    the shipowner as his treasurer, the sum of one thousand drachmae to distribute\n                    among the Boeotian trierarchs, that they might remain with the fleet until his\n                    trial should come off, for fear lest, if the Boeotian fleet should first be\n                    broken up and the troops scattered here and there to their homes, you might be\n                    the more incensed against him. For although\n                    our countrymen endured their privations and remained at their posts, the\n                    Boeotians declared that they would not stay, unless somebody should furnish them\n                    with their daily rations. Under stress of necessity, then, at that time he\n                    borrowed the thousand drachmae from Antiphanes, who sailed with Philip, the\n                    shipowner, as his treasurer, and gave them to the admiral of the Boeotian fleet.\n                        But when he got back to Athens, both\n                    Philip and Antiphanes demanded of him the thousand drachmae which he had\n                    borrowed in Calaureia, and were angry at not receiving their money at once.\n                    Timotheus, then, fearing that his enemies might learn that the thousand\n                    drachmae, which in his report he stated he had paid for the Boeotian fleet out\n                    of the military fund, had in fact been lent by Philip, who could not get them\n                    back, and fearing also that Philip might give\n                    testimony against him at his trial, came to my father and begged him to settle\n                    with Philip, and to lend him the thousand drachmae to pay Philip. And my father,\n                    seeing the seriousness of the trial in which the defendant was involved, and in\n                    what plight he was, felt pity for him, and, taking him to the bank, bade\n                    Phormio, who was cashier, to pay Philip the thousand drachmae, and to enter on\n                    the books Timotheus as owing that amount. To prove that these statements are true, I\n                    shall bring forward Phormio, who paid the money, as a witness, as soon as I\n                    shall have explained to you the other loan, in order that, being informed\n                    through the same deposition about the whole of the debt, you may know that I am\n                    speaking the truth. I shall also call before you Antiphanes, who lent the sum of\n                    one thousand drachmae to the defendant in Calaureia, and who was present when\n                    Philip received payment of the money from my father here in Athens. That I did not put the deposition in the box before\n                    the arbitrator was due to a trick of Antiphanes, who kept saying that he would\n                    give evidence for me on the day set for the decision; but when the hearing was\n                    in progress before the arbitrator, although he was summoned from his house\n                    for he was nowhere to be seen, he was persuaded by Timotheus\n                    to fail to appear as a witness. On my depositing a drachma in his name on a\n                    charge of failing to appear, as the law prescribes, the arbitrator did not make\n                    an award against the defendant, but decided in his favor, and then went off, for\n                    it was already late. Now, however, I have\n                    entered suit on my own account for damages against Antiphanes because he neither\n                    gave testimony for me, nor asked under oath for a postponement, as the law\n                    provides. And I demand of him that he get up and state under oath before you,\n                    first, whether he lent Timotheus a thousand drachmae in Calaureia, and secondly,\n                    whether Philip received here payment of that sum from my father. The defendant himself practically admitted before the\n                    arbitrator that my father paid Philip the thousand drachmae; but he declared\n                    that it was not to him Timotheus that my father lent the\n                    money, but to the Boeotian admiral, who, he alleges, gave some copper as\n                    security for the sum. However, that in this he was not stating the truth, but\n                    that he borrowed the money himself and is seeking to avoid payment, I shall\n                    prove to you, when I shall have informed you in detail regarding his other debts\n                    also. In the\n                    month Maimacterion in the\n                    archonship of Asteius,\n                    Alcetas and Jason came to visit Timotheus to be present at his trial and give\n                    him their support, and they arrived at his house in Peiraeus in the\n                        Hippodameia when it was already evening. Being at a loss\n                    how to entertain them, he sent his body servant Aeschrion to my father and bade\n                    him ask for the loan of some bedding and cloaks and two silver bowls and to\n                    borrow a mina of silver. And my father,\n                    hearing from Aeschrion, the body-servant of the defendant, that they had arrived\n                    and the urgent need for which the request was made, both supplied the objects\n                    for which the slave had come and lent the mina of silver which he asked to\n                    borrow. Well, when he had been acquitted of the charge, the defendant found\n                    himself in sore straits for money to pay his private debts and the taxes to the\n                    state, and my father, seeing this, did not venture to demand repayment of the\n                    money at once; for, while he did not think\n                    that Timotheus would defraud him when he had the means to pay, he did not\n                    himself see any way to exact payment from him when he was without means. So,\n                    after the departure of Alcetas and Jason, Aeschrion, the defendant's\n                    body-servant, brought back the bedding and the cloaks, but he did not return the\n                    two bowls, for which he had asked at the time he borrowed the bedding and the\n                    mina of silver., when Alcetas and Jason arrived at the defendant's house.\n                        Then, when he was about to leave the\n                    country to take service with the king, and had arranged to sail as the king's\n                    general to carry on the Egyptian war, in order that he might not have to submit\n                    an account and vouchers for his military administration here, he sent for my\n                    father to come to the Paralion, thanked him for his former\n                    services to him, and, introducing to him\n                    Philondas, a Megarian by birth, but one who resided as an alien at\n                    Athens,a man who at that time was loyally devoted to the defendant\n                    and was employed in his servicehe begged my father, that when\n                    Philonidas whom he then introduced to him should come back\n                    from Macedonia bringing some timber, which had been given to the defendant by\n                        Amyntas, he would supply him with money for the freight of the\n                    timber, and let him deliver the timber to the defendant's house in Peiraeus; for\n                    he declared the timber belonged to him. At the\n                    same time in preferring this request, he made statements which are quite\n                    inconsistent with his present actions. For he said that even if he should not\n                    obtain what he asked of my father, he would not be angry, as another might who\n                    failed to obtain what he wanted, but would show his gratitude, if he should ever\n                    find himself able to do so, for the services which my father had rendered him at\n                    his request. On hearing this my father was pleased at his words and commended\n                    him for remembering the favors shown him, and promised to do all that he asked.\n                        Timotheus, then, after this set sail to\n                    join the king's generals, but Philondas, to whom he had presented my father as\n                    one who would pay the freight, when he should come back with the timber, set out\n                    on his journey to Macedonia. The time was about the month Thargelion, in the archonship of Asteius. In the following year Philondas came back from\n                    Macedonia, bringing the timber, while Timotheus was absent in the king's\n                    service. He approached my father and asked him to furnish the freight for the\n                    timber, in order that he might settle with the shipowner, as Timotheus had\n                    begged my father to do, when he was about to sail and had introduced Philondas\n                    to him. So my father took him to the bank and ordered Phormio to pay him the\n                    freight of the timber, one thousand seven hundred and fifty drachmae. And Phormio counted out the money, and set down\n                    Timotheus as owing it for it was he who had asked my father to furnish\n                    the freight for the timber, and the timber was his, and he wrote a\n                    memorandum of the purpose for which the money was received, and the name of the\n                    person who received it. The date of the transaction was the archonship of\n                        Alcisthenes, the year after Timotheus set sail to take\n                    service with the king. About the same time\n                    Timosthenes of Aegilia also arrived home from a journey abroad which he had\n                    made on private business. Timosthenes was a friend and partner of Phormio, and\n                    when he set sail he had given to Phormio to put away for him along with other\n                    articles two bowls of Lycian workmanship. By chance the boy, not knowing that\n                    these bowls were the property of someone else, gave them to Aeschrion, the\n                    body-servant of the defendant, when he was sent to my father by Timotheus and\n                    requested the bedding and the cloaks and the bowls, and borrowed the mina of\n                    silver at the time when Alcetas and Jason came to the defendant's house.\n                        When Timosthenes reached home and asked\n                    for the return of the bowls, Timotheus being still abroad in the king's service,\n                    my father persuaded him to accept the value of the bowls, as much as they were\n                    worth by weight, namely two hundred and thirty-seven drachmae. So he paid to\n                    Timosthenes the value of the bowls and entered on his books the defendant as\n                    owing what he paid to Timosthenes for the bowls in addition to the rest of the\n                    debt which the defendant owed him. To prove that all these statements of mine are true the\n                    clerk shall read you the depositions which bear upon them; first, that of those\n                    who were at that time clerks in the bank and paid the money from its funds to\n                    the persons to whom Timotheus bade them pay it, and then that of the man who\n                    received the price of the bowls.You have learned, then, from the\n                    depositions which have just been read, that I am telling you nothing but the\n                    truth regarding the matters which I mentioned. And that the defendant himself\n                    admits that the timber brought by Philondas was delivered to his house in the\n                    Peiraeus,this, too, is proved by the deposition which will be read to\n                        you.\n                    That the\n                    timber, then, which Philondas brought was the property of the defendant I have\n                    his own testimony to prove; for he admitted before the arbitrator that it was\n                    delivered to his house in Peiraeus, as those who heard him have testified. But\n                    besides this I shall try to prove to you by circumstantial evidence that I am\n                    telling the truth. For do you suppose, men of\n                    the jury, that, if the timber had not been the property of Timotheus, and if he\n                    had not begged my fatherat the time he introduced Philondas to him,\n                    when he was about to set sail to join the king's generalsto provide\n                    the freight, my father would ever have allowed Philondas to carry the timber\n                    away from the harbor, seeing that it was pledeged as security to him for the\n                    freight, and would not rather have set one of his servants to keep watch and to\n                    receive the price as the timber was sold, until he had recovered his money, if\n                    we suppose that the timber was the property of Philondas and was brought in for\n                    the sake of trade? Then, besides this, does it\n                    seem to anyone likely, that if Timotheus had not bidden my father to supply the\n                    freight for the timber given to him by Amyntas, my father would have trusted\n                    Philondas, and have suffered him to deliver the timber to the defendant's house?\n                    Or, how is it possible that Philondas, as is stated by the defendant, brought in\n                    the timber for the sake of trade, and yet that the defendant on his return used\n                    this timber for the building of his house? And\n                    observe this also, that many worthy citizens were friends of the defendant and\n                    looked after his affairs while Timotheus was abroad in the service of the king,\n                    and yet not one of these has dared to testify on his behalf either that\n                    Philondas did not receive from the bank the freight of the timber, or that,\n                    having received it, he paid it back; or, again, that any one of them settled for\n                    the freight of the timber which Philondas brought and which had been given to\n                    the defendant by Amyntas. For they deem it a matter of higher import to\n                    themselves to preserve their character as worthy and honorable men than to do a\n                    favor to Timotheus by giving false testimony. But they declared that they would not testify to the truth against him; for\n                    they said he was their friend. Since, then, no one of those who are his friends,\n                    and who looked after his affairs when he was abroad in the service of the king,\n                    has ventured to testify either that Philondas did not receive from the bank the\n                    freight for the timber, or that any one of them paid it, is it not reasonable\n                    that you should believe that I am speaking the truth? Surely he will not venture to say this, that anyone other than my\n                    father paid the freight for the timber which Philondas brought. If he does\n                    insist upon this argument, demand of him that he produce before you the\n                    deposition of the person who paid the freight for the timber. For it is admitted\n                    that he was himself abroad in the king's service, and as for Philondas, whom he\n                    sent to fetch the timber and whom he introduced to my fatheryou found\n                    on your return from the king's service, Timotheus, that he was dead. It must be, then, that some other of your relatives\n                    and friends, whom you left to look after your affairs when you were about to go\n                    abroad, knows from what source Philondas got the freight for the timber and paid\n                    the shipowner, if you deny that you introduced my father to Philondas, or that\n                    Philondas got the freight for the timber from my father. However, you cannot produce a deposition from any of\n                    your friends to prove that the freight for the timber was not received from the\n                    bank, while you were abroad; therefore one or the other of two things follows:\n                    either you are on good terms with no one of your friends and have no confidence\n                    in any of your connections, or else, though knowing well that Philondas did\n                    receive the freight for the timber from my father, to whom you introduced him\n                    when you were about to set out on your voyage, you see fit to rob us, if you\n                    can, and enrich yourself. On my part, men of\n                    the jury, in addition to the deposition which I have produced before you of\n                    those who at the time were serving as clerks in the bank and who paid the money\n                    to the persons to whom Timotheus bade them pay it, I was ready also to confirm\n                    my statements by an oath, which the clerk will read to you.Now, men of the jury, my father not only\n                    wrote out and left to me a record of his credits, but also during his illness\n                    told me of each particular debt that was due to him, the person in whose\n                    possession the money was, and the purpose for which it was received; and he made\n                    these statements to my brother also. To prove that I am speaking the truth in\n                    this, read, please, the deposition of my brother.\n                    Well then, that\n                    Timotheus was left by my father owing us the money as a debtor for which I am\n                    suing him, and that this is a part of my share, my brother has testified, and so\n                    has Phormio, who paid the money; and I was ready confirm the fact by an oath.\n                    But when the defendant challenged me before the arbitrator, bidding me bring the\n                    books from the bank and demanding copies, and sent Phrasiendes to the bank, I\n                    brought out the books and allowed Phrasiendes to examine them and to copy out\n                    the entries of all the sums that Timotheus owed. To prove that the defendant\n                    himself admitted having received the copies, please read the deposition.\n                    I therefore\n                    brought the books to the arbitrator. Phormio and Euphraeus, who had paid the\n                    money to the persons designated by Timotheus, were present, and they exposed his\n                    falsehoods by showing the date at which he had contracted each loan, the person\n                    who received the money, and the use for which he expended it. Regarding the one\n                    thousand three hundred and fifty-one drachmae two obols, which he borrowed as\n                    the first loan in the month Munichion in the archonship of Socratidas, when he\n                    was about to set out on his voyage, and which the defendant ordered to be paid\n                    to Antimachus, his treasurer, he declared that my father lent the money to\n                    Antimachus on his own private account, and that he the\n                    defendant did not himself receive it. To prove the truth of this statement he has produced no witness, but is\n                    vigorous in his assertion, in order that it may not appear that he is himself\n                    defrauding us, but that Antimachus borrowed the money. And yet, men of the jury,\n                    I will give you a convincing proof that my father lent the money, not to\n                    Antimachus, but to Timotheus when he was about to sail. For which do you think\n                    would have been the easier course for my father, to file a claim against the\n                    estate of Antimachus, when his property was confiscated, for this sum as due to\n                    him, supposing he had lent it to Antimachus, or to wait until the defendant might be in better circumstances so as to\n                    collect it from him, seeing that he had at that time little hope of deliverance?\n                    Surely, if he had filed the claim, he would not have been at a loss to find the\n                    deposit money, nor would you have had any cause to disbelieve him.\n                    For you all know that my father had no wish unjustly to acquire public funds,\n                    but that he willingly expended his own money in your service whenever you bade\n                    him do so; and besides, Callistratus, who sold\n                    the goods of Antimachus, was a friend of his, so that my father was meeting no\n                    opposition. What possible motive then, could my father have had to leave\n                    Timotheus inscribed in his books is our debtor, if he did not really owe the\n                    money, rather than file his claim and recover his debt from the confiscated\n                    estate of Antimachus? Now with regard to the one thousand drachmae which he borrowed\n                    from Antiphanes in Calaureia to distribute to the Boeotian trierarchs,when he\n                    was about to sail home for his trial, and which he paid to Philip the shipowner\n                    after he had got them from my father, he maintains that the Boeotian admiral\n                    borrowed the money and gave my father some copper as security for it. That this,\n                    however, is untrue, I will give you a convincing proof. In the first place, it is proved that the defendant\n                    borrowed the thousand drachmae in Calaureia, and not the Boeotian admiral;\n                    secondly, that Philip demanded payment of the thousand drachmae here from\n                    Timotheus and not from the Boeotian admiral, and that Timotheus made payment and\n                    not the Boeotian admiral; for it was quite proper that the Boeotian admiral\n                    should receive from Timotheus the maintenance for the crews of his ships, since\n                    the pay for the troops came out of a common contribution, and it was you,\n                    Timotheus, who collected all the money from the allies, and you were bound to\n                    account for it. Again, supposing the Boeotian\n                    fleet had disbanded and the troops had dispersed to their various homes, the\n                    Boeotian admiral was in no danger from the Athenians, nor was any trial\n                    impending over him; you, however, were in very great danger, and in your utter\n                    terror you thought it would be a great aid to your defence, if the Boeotian\n                    triremes should stay with the fleet until your trial should come off. Besides,\n                    from what motive of friendship pray, would my father have lent the one thousand\n                    drachmae to the Boeotian admiral whom he did not even know? Ah, but he says the\n                    admiral pledged some copper as security. How much, then? and from what country\n                    was it imported? And from what source did the\n                    Boeotian admiral get the copper? Was it imported by way of trade, or was it\n                    obtained from prisoners? Then who were the persons who brought the copper to my\n                    father? Were they hired men, or slaves? And\n                    which one of our slaves was it who received it? For, if slaves brought it, he\n                    ought to have delivered them up for the torture, but if hired men, he ought to\n                    have demanded for the torture the slave of ours who received and weighed the\n                    copper; for, I fancy, neither would the one taking the copper in pledge accept\n                    it, nor the one offering it give it over, without weighing; nor was my father\n                    likely to carry the copper and weigh it himself, since he had slaves who were\n                    accustomed to receive the articles given as security for loans. And I certainly wonder for what possible reason the\n                    Boeotian admiral should have given the copper to my father as security, if he\n                    owed a thousand drachmae to Philip. Was it that Philip would not have been glad\n                    to receive interest, if his money was lent safely and on security? or that\n                    Philip had no money? So, what need was there for the Boeotian admiral to ask my\n                    father to lend the thousand drachmae and pay Philip, rather than give the copper\n                    as security to Philip? But, men of the jury,\n                    the copper was not given as security, nor did the Boeotian admiral borrow the\n                    thousand drachmae from my father, but this man Timotheus borrowed them, being in\n                    great distress; and the urgent need, to meet which he used the money, I have\n                    told you. But instead of evincing gratitude for the confidence shown him and the\n                    loan which he received from my father, he thinks it proper to defraud us, if he\n                    can, even of the principal. Now, as to the bowls and the mina of silver, which he borrowed\n                    from my father when he sent his bodyservant Aeschrion to my father in the night,\n                    I asked him before the arbitrator if Aeschrion was still a slave, and demanded\n                    that he be put to the test in his hide. He answered that Aeschrion was free, so I desisted from my\n                    demand; but I required him to put in a deposition made by Aeschrion as being a\n                    free man. He, however, neither provided a\n                    deposition from Aeschrion, as being free, nor would he deliver him up as a slave\n                    that proof might be had from his body; for he was afraid that, if he produced a\n                    deposition from him as being free, I should bring suit for false testimony, and\n                    after proving that Aeschrion had testified falsely, should proceed against\n                    Timotheus himself for subornation, as the law provides; and if, again, he should\n                    deliver him up for the torture, he was afraid that Aeschrion would state the\n                    truth against him. And yet it was a fine\n                    opportunity for him, if he was unable to produce witnesses concerning the other\n                    receipts of money, to prove this at any rate by the words of\n                    Aeschrionthat the bowls and the mina of silver were not received, and\n                    that Aeschrion was not sent by him to my father; and then to use this as\n                    evidence to you that I am uttering falsehoods in regard to my other claims upon\n                    him, seeing that his slave, whom I declare to have received the bowls and the\n                    mina of silver, was proved by the torture not to have received them. If, then, this would have been a strong piece of\n                    evidence for him to use before you, that, namely, he offered to deliver up\n                    Aeschrion, whom I declare to have been sent by the defendant and to have\n                    received the bowls from my father and to have borrowed the mina of silver, let\n                    it also be evidence for me to use before you, that knowing my claims to be true,\n                    he does not dare to deliver up Aeschrion for the torture. Well, he will make the\n                    defence that he was listed in the books of the bank in the archonship of\n                    Alcisthenes as having received the freight of the timber and the price of the\n                    bowls, which my father paid to Timosthenes on his behalf, and that he was not at\n                    that time in the country, but was in the service of the king. About this I wish\n                    to give you accurate information, that you may understand clearly how the books\n                    of the bank are kept. The defendant in the\n                    month Thargelion in the archonship of Asteius when he was about to sail to take\n                    service with the king, introduced Philondas to my father; and in the following\n                    year in the archonship of Alcisthenes, Philondas arrived bringing the timber\n                    from Macedonia and received the freight from my father, while Timotheus was\n                    abroad in the service of the king. Accordingly they entered the defendant as\n                    debtor at the time they paid the money, not at the time when, being in Athens,\n                    he had introduced Philondas to my father. For,\n                    when he introduced him, the timber had not yet come, but Philondas was about to\n                    make the journey to fetch it; when, however, he came back, bringing the timber,\n                    the defendant was abroad, but Philondas received the freight for the timber\n                    according to the defendant's orders, and the timber was delivered to the\n                    defendant's house in Peiraeus. That Timotheus was not well provided with funds\n                    when he sailed from Athens is already known to all of you to whom his estate was\n                    mortgaged, and whom he is now seeking to defraud.However, to prove that he borrowed money from some of our citizens without\n                    security, since he had no equivalent security to give, please read the\n                        deposition.\n                    Now regarding\n                    the bowls which Aeschrion, the body-servant of the defendant, requested of me in\n                    the month Maimacterion in the archonship of Asteius, when Timotheus was in\n                    Athens at the time when he entertained Alcetas and Jason, and with the value of\n                    which he was debited in the archonship of Alcisthenesfor some time my\n                    father supposed he would return the bowls which he had borrowed; but when he\n                    went off without having returned them, and the bowls of Timosthenes were no\n                    longer in the custody of Phormio, and the one who had deposited them came and\n                    demanded their return, my father paid the price of the bowls to Timosthenes, and\n                    wrote the defendant down as owing this sum in addition to the rest of his debt.\n                        If, then, he makes use of this defence,\n                    that he was not in Athens at the time when he was debited with the cost of the\n                    bowls, make this reply to him: You received them, when here, and\n                    since you did not return them, and were abroad, and the bowls which the\n                    depositor claimed were not there, you were debited with their value, that sum,\n                    namely, which was paid for the bowls. Ah but, he will perhaps say, my father ought to have demanded the\n                    return of the bowls from him. But my father saw in what straits you were,\n                    Timotheus. He trusted you in regard to the rest of your debt, and believed that\n                    after your return to Athens he would recover his money from you, when you should\n                    be better off for funds. Was he, then, going to distrust you in the matter of\n                    the bowls? He promised at your request that he would provide the freight for the\n                    timber when you were sailing to take service with the king; was he, then, going\n                    to distrust you because of a couple of bowls? He did not demand of you that you\n                    pay the rest of the debt, because he saw that you were without funds. Was he,\n                    then, going to demand the bowls? I wish now to speak about the challenge to an oath,\n                    which I tendered the defendant, and he tendered me. For after I had put an oath\n                    in the evidence-box, he thought that, by taking an oath himself, he could be\n                    quit of the affair. And, if I had not known that he had flagrantly perjured\n                    himself in many solemn oaths both to states and to individuals, I should have\n                    allowed him to take the oath; but as it was, seeing that I had witnesses to\n                    prove that the persons appointed by him had in fact received the money from the\n                    bank, and conclusive circumstantial evidence as well, it seemed to me a\n                    monstrous thing to give an oath to one who would not only take no care to swear\n                    honestly, but who, when it was a question of gain, has not spared even temples.\n                        The specific instances of the perjuries\n                    which he has committed without scruple would make a long story; but I will call\n                    to your minds the most flagrant instances and those of which you are all well\n                    aware. You know that he swore in the assembly, imprecating destruction upon\n                    himself and dedicating his property to sacred uses, if he should fail to indict\n                    Iphicrates as a usurper of the rights of citizenship. Yet, although he had sworn\n                    and promised this in the assembly, no long time afterwards, in order to serve\n                    his own interests, he gave his daughter in marraige to the son of Iphicrates.\n                        When a man, then, felt no shame in\n                    deceiving you to whom he had pledged his word, though there are laws which\n                    declare that, if a man deceive the people by a promise, he shall be liable to\n                    impeachment,when, after swearing and imprecating destruction upon\n                    himself, he had no fear of the gods in whose name he had perjured\n                    himselfwas it strange that I was unwilling to allow him to take an\n                    oath? Again, not very long ago, he once more solemnly declared in the assembly\n                    that he had not adequate provision for his old agehe, who possesses\n                    so large an estate; so insatiate and grasping is his character. I should be glad, however, to ask you whether you\n                    feel anger against bankers who have failed. For, if you have reason to feel\n                    anger against them because they do you injury, is it not reasonable for you to\n                    support those who do you no injury? Surely it is through men like Timotheus that\n                    banks are caused to fail; for when they are in need they borrow money, and think\n                    they should obtain credit because of their reputation; but when they are in\n                    funds they do not make payments but seek to defraud their creditors. All matters, men of\n                    the jury, in proof of which I was able to provide witnesses, have been proved to\n                    you by witnesses; further, I have shown you by circumstantial evidence that\n                    Timotheus owes the money to my father. I beg you therefore to aid me in\n                    recovering from my father's debtors the estate which he left me."}}, {"@type": "speech", "@n": "50", "head": "Apollodorus Against Polycles", "p":

For the\n                    suit is not a private one concerning Polycles and myself alone, but it touches\n                    also the interests of the state as well. In cases where the charges indeed are\n                    of a private nature, but the injury is public, it is surely fitting that you\n                    should listen and decide aright. If I had come before you quarrelling with\n                    Polycles about a contract of some other sort, the contest would have concerned\n                    Polycles and myself alone; but as it is, the question concerns the succession to\n                    a ship, and extra trierarchal expenses for five months and six days, and it\n                    concerns also the laws, whether they are to be in force, or not. It seems to me, therefore, to be necessary to explain\n                    all the facts to you from the beginning. And by the gods, men of the jury, I beg\n                    you not to think that I am talking idly, if I set forth at some length what I\n                    have expended and what I have done, to show that my several services were\n                    rendered opportunely, and that they were helpful to the state. If anyone is able\n                    to show that I am uttering falsehoods, let him get up in the time allotted to me\n                    and disprove whatever statement I may make to you which he holds to be false.\n                    But if my statements are true, and no one would contradict them save the\n                    defendant, I make of you all a request that is fair. All you who were in the army and were present in the campaign, call\n                    to mind and tell to those who sit by you my own efforts and the troubles and\n                    distresses in which the state was involved at that crisis, in order that you may\n                    know from this evidence what manner of man I am in carrying out the orders you\n                    lay upon me. And all of you who stayed at home, listen to me in silence, while I\n                    set forth before you all the facts, and produce in support of every statement\n                    that I make the laws and decrees both of the senate and the people, and the\n                    testimony of witnesses. On the twenty-fourth day of the month Metageitnion in the archonship of\n                        Molon, when an assembly had been held\n                    and tidings of many serious events had been brought before you, you voted that\n                    the trierarchs of whom I was one should launch their ships.\n                    It is not necessary for me to go into details regarding the crisis which had at\n                    that time befallen the state; you of yourselves know that Tenos had been seized by Alexander, and its people had\n                    been reduced to slavery; that Miltocythes had\n                    revolted from Cotys, and had sent ambassadors regarding an alliance, begging you\n                    to send troops to his aid, and offering to restore the Chersonesus; that the\n                        Proconnesians, your allies, were\n                    requesting you in the assembly to come to their aid, stating that the\n                        Cyzicenes were pressing them hard in war by both land\n                    and sea, and imploring you not to look idly on while they perished. When you heard all these tidings at that time in the\n                    assembly from both the speakers themselves and those who supported them; when\n                    furthermore the merchants and shipowners were about to sail out of the Pontus,\n                    and the Byzantines and Calchedonians and Cyzicenes were forcing\n                    their ships to put in to their ports because of the scarcity of grain in their\n                    own countries; seeing also that the price of grain was advancing in the\n                    Peiraeus, and that there was not very much to be bought, you voted that the\n                    trierarchs should launch their ships and bring them up to the pier, and that the\n                    members of the senate and the demarchs should make out lists of the demesmen and\n                    reports of available seamen, and that the armament should be despatched at once,\n                    and aid sent to the various regions. And this decree, proposed by Aristophon,\n                    was passed, as follows:\n                    The decree,\n                    then, you have heard, men of the jury. For my own part, when the sailors listed\n                    by the demesmen did not appear, save a very few, and these incompetent, I\n                    dismissed them; and having mortgaged my property and borrowed money, I was the\n                    first to man my ship, hiring the best sailors possible by giving to each man\n                    large bonuses and advance payments. More than that, I furnished the ship with\n                    equipment wholly my own, taking nothing from the public stores, and I made\n                    everything as beautiful and magnificent as possible, outdoing all the other\n                    trierarchs. As for rowers, I hired the best that could be had. And not only did I defray the trierarchal expenses,\n                    which at that time were so very heavy, but I also paid in advance no small part\n                    of the taxes which you had ordered to be collected for the cost of the\n                    expedition. For when you had voted that the members of the senate on behalf of\n                    the demesmen should report the names of those who were to pay taxes in advance,\n                    both of those who were members of the demes and those who owned property in\n                    them, my name was reported from three demes, as my property was in land.\n                        Of these I was the first to pay my taxes in\n                    advance, nor did I seek to get myself excused either on the ground that I was\n                    serving as trierarch and could not defray the costs of two public services at\n                    once, or that the laws did not permit such a thing. And I have never recovered\n                    the money which I advanced, because at the time I was abroad in your service as\n                    trierarch, and afterwards, when I returned, I found that the money from those\n                    who had resources had already been gathered in by others, and that those who\n                    were left had nothing. To prove that I am stating the truth to you in this, the clerk\n                    shall read you the depositions covering these matters, those of the persons who\n                    at that time collected the military supplies and of the despatching board; also\n                    the record of the pay which I gave out every month to the rowers and the\n                    marines, receiving from the generals subsistence-money alone, except pay for two\n                    months only in a period of a year and five months also a list of the sailors who\n                    were hired, and how much money each of them received; to the end that from this\n                    evidence you may know how generous I was and why the defendant was unwilling to\n                    take over the ship from me when the term of my trierarchy had expired.\n                    The proof,\n                    then, that I am uttering no falsehoods in regard to the matters which I have\n                    mentioned, you have learned, men of the jury, from the reading of the\n                    depositions. But, further, you will all agree with me that what I am about to\n                    say is true. It is admitted that the usefulness of a ship is done away with,\n                    first, if the men are not paid, and secondly, if she put into the Peiraeus\n                    before her expedition is finished; for in that case there is a great deal of\n                    desertion, and those of the sailors who remain are unwilling to embark again,\n                    unless additional money is given them for their household expenses. Both of\n                    these things happened to me, men of the jury, so that my trierarchy became the\n                    more costly. For I received no pay from the\n                    general for the space of eight months, and I sailed home to Peiraeus with the\n                    ambassadors because my ship was the fastest sailer, and again, when I was\n                    ordered by the people to take Menon the general to the Hellespont to replace\n                    Autocles, who had been removed from his command, I set sail on short notice from\n                    Athens. In the place of the seamen who had deserted I hired others, giving them\n                    large bonuses and advance payments, and I gave to those of the original sailors\n                    who stayed with me something to leave behind for the maintenance of their\n                    households in addition to what they had before; for I was well aware of the need they felt, and how it pressed upon each one,\n                    and I was myself embarrassed for funds as, by Zeus and Apollo, no one could\n                    believe, who had not accurately followed the course of my affairs. However, I\n                    mortgaged my farm to Thrasylochus and Archenes, and having borrowed\n                    thirty minae from them and distributed the money among the crew, I put to sea,\n                    that no part of the people's orders might fail to be carried out, as far as it\n                    depended on me. And the people, hearing of this, gave me a vote of thanks, and\n                    invited me to dine in the Prytaneum.To prove that\n                    I am speaking the truth in this, the clerk shall read you the deposition dealing\n                    with these facts, and the decree of the people.\n                    Then, when we\n                    came to the Hellespont, and the term of my trierarchy had expired, and no pay\n                    had been given to the soldiers except for two months when another general,\n                    Timomachus, had comethough even he brought to the fleet no new\n                    trierarchs to relieve those in service,many of my crew became\n                    discouraged and went off, deserting the ship, some to the mainland to take\n                    military service, and some to the fleet of the Thasians, and\n                        Maronites, won over by the promise of high pay and receiving\n                    substantial sums in advance. They saw also\n                    that my resources were by now exhausted, that the state was neglectful of them,\n                    that our allies were in need, and the generals not to be depended on, and that\n                    they had been deceived by the words of many of them; and they knew that the term\n                    of my trierarchy had expired and that their voyage was not to be homeward and\n                    that no successor had arrived to take command from whom they could expect any\n                    relief. For the more ambitious I had been to man my ship with good rowers, by so\n                    much was the desertion from me greater than from the other trierarchs.\n                        For the others had this advantage at any\n                    rate, that the sailors who had come to their ships drawn from the official\n                    lists, stayed with them in order to make sure of their return home when the\n                    general should discharge them; whereas mine, trusting in their skill as able\n                    rowers, went off wherever they were likely to be re-employed at the highest\n                    wages, thinking more of their gain for the immediate present than of the danger\n                    impending over them, if they should ever be caught by me. Consequently when my\n                    affairs were in the condition which I have described, and at the same time I was\n                    ordered by the general, Timomachus, to sail to Hieron to convoy the grain, though he provided no pay\n                    word had been brought that the Byzantines and the Calchedonians were\n                    again bringing the ships into port and forcing them to unload their\n                    grain, I borrowed money from Archidemus of Anaphlystus, fifteen minae at interest, and I secured from Nicippus,\n                    the shipowner, who happened to be in Sestus, eight hundred drachmae, as a\n                    maritime loan at 12 1/2 per cent, on condition that I should pay him principal\n                    and interest when the ship should get safely back to Athens. Further, I sent Euctemon, the pentecontarch, to Lampsacus, giving him money\n                    and letters to friends of my father, and bade him hire for me the best sailors\n                    he could. I myself stayed in Sestus and gave some moneyall I\n                    hadto the old sailors who stayed with me, since the term of my\n                    trierarchy had expired, and I secured also some other sailors at full pay, while\n                    the general was making ready for his voyage to Hieron. But when Euctemon came back from Lampsacus, bringing the sailors\n                    whom he had hired, and the general gave the word for us to put to sea, it\n                    happened that Euctemon suddenly fell sick, and was in a very serious condition.\n                    I, therefore, gave him his pay, adding money for his journey, and sent him home;\n                    while I secured another pentecontarch and put out to sea to convoy the grain,\n                    and I stayed there forty-five days, until the vessels sailed out from Pontus\n                    after the rising of Arcturus.\n                    When I arrived at Sestus, I expected to sail\n                    for home, as my term of service had expired, and I had already served two months\n                    beyond it and no successor had arrived to take over the ship. The general,\n                    Timomachus, however,for an embassy from the Maronites had come to\n                    him, begging him to convoy their grain shipsordered us trierarchs to\n                    make cables fast to the ships and tow them to Maroneiaa long voyage\n                    across the open sea. I have told all these facts to you from the beginning, that you\n                    may know how much I have myself expended and how burdensome my service as\n                    trierarch has been to me, and all the expenses which I subsequently bore in the\n                    interest of the defendant by serving beyond my term, since he did not come to\n                    take over the ship, and all the dangers I myself incurred from storms and from\n                    the enemy. For after we had convoyed the ships to Maroneia, and had arrived at\n                    Thasos, Timomachus came and undertook again in conjunction with the Thasians to\n                    convoy grain and a body of peltasts to Strym, with the intention of taking\n                    the place himself. However, the Maronites\n                    arrayed their ships against us in defence of the place, and offered battle, and\n                    our men were tired out with their long voyage and from towing the ships from\n                    Thasos to Strym besides, it was stormy, and the place offered no\n                    harbor, and it was impossible to go ashore and get a meal, for the country was\n                    hostile, and all around the wall bands of mercenaries and barbarians from the\n                    neighborhood lay encamped; so we were forced to ride at anchor all night long in\n                    the open sea without food and without sleep, keeping watch lest the ships of the\n                    Maronites should attack us in the night. Nor\n                    was this all. It was our lot to have by night rain and thunder and a violent\n                    wind at that season of the year for the time was just at the setting\n                    of the Pleiades; so can you not imagine,\n                    men of the jury, what despondency fell upon our men, and what an amount of\n                    desertion I had again to face after this? For the old sailors had borne many\n                    hardships and received but little compensationmerely what I was able\n                    to borrow and give to each man in addition to what they had had from me before,\n                    since the general did not supply enough even for their daily sustenance. By now\n                    I had served three months beyond my term, and the defendant had not yet come to\n                    take over the ship; but I borrowed money and hired sailors to replace those who\n                    had deserted. The defendant alone of the trierarchs appointed to succeed us has no excuse\n                    left him for not having come to take over the ship long before. For Euctemon,\n                    the pentecontarch, after he was sent home from the Hellespont on account of his\n                    sickness, when he reached port and heard that Polycles had been appointed to\n                    relieve me, knowing that the term of my trierarchy had expired and that I was\n                    now serving over time, took with him my father-in-law, Deinias, and coming up to\n                    Polycles in the sample market, bade him set sail and take over the ship with all\n                    speed, telling him that the expenses which were incurred every day in addition\n                    to the provision money supplied by the general were very heavy. He told him in detail of the pay given each month to\n                    the rowers and the marines, both to the sailors whom he had himself hired at\n                    Lampsacus and to those who came on board subsequently to replace those who had\n                    deserted, and also of the additional sums which I had given to each of the old\n                    sailors at their request after the term of my trierarchy had expired, and all\n                    the rest of the money expended upon the ship from day to day. With all these\n                    matters Euctemon was thoroughly acquainted, for it was through him as\n                    pentecontarch that all purchases and disbursements were made. He told him, too, about the ship's equipment, that it\n                    was wholly my own, and that I had nothing from the public stores.\n                    Therefore, he said, plan to come to an\n                    agreement with him, or sail from here taking your own equipment with you. I\n                    think, however, he added, that he will readily come to\n                    terms with you; for he owes money there, which he will be glad to pay from the\n                    price of the equipment. When the defendant heard these words from\n                    Euctemon and Deinias my father-in-law, he made no answer to them regarding the\n                    matters of which they spoke but, they said, he broke into a laugh, and said,\n                    The mouse has just tasted pitch; for he wanted to be an\n                    Athenian. Well, when he paid no\n                    heed to what he heard from Euctemon and Deinias, later on Pythodorus of\n                        Acharnae, and Apollodorus of Leucono, \n                    friends and connections of mine, again approached him, and urged him to go and\n                    take over the ship, as he had been designated as my successor; and they told him\n                    about the equipment, that it was wholly my own, and that I had nothing from the\n                    public stores. So, if you want to\n                    make use of that, they said, leave money here, and do not\n                    run the risk of carrying it abroad. For they wanted to redeem the\n                    farm for me by paying Archenes and Thrasylochus thirty minae.\n                    Regarding the wear and tear of the ship's equipment they were willing to draw up\n                    an agreement with him, and themselves to be sureties for me, that he would\n                    assuredly have the terms which the other trierarchs gave to their\n                        successors.To prove that I am speaking the\n                    truth in all this, the clerk shall read you the depositions bearing upon these\n                        matters.\n                    There are many\n                    proofs from which I think I can show you that Polycles neither at the first\n                    intended to take over the ship from me, nor, after he was forced by you and your\n                    decree to go and join the ship, was he willing to take it over as my successor.\n                    For after he arrived at Thasos, when I was serving for the fourth month after my\n                    term had expired, I took witnesses with me, as many of the citizens as I could\n                    and the marines and rowers, and, coming up to him in the market-place at Thasos,\n                    I bade him take over the ship from me as my successor and repay me what I had\n                    expended since the expiration of my term. I\n                    was ready to reckon it up item by item, while I had by me as witnesses to the\n                    expenditures the sailors and the marines and the rowers, in order that, if he\n                    disputed anything, I might refute him at once. Everything had been recorded so\n                    accurately by me, that I had written down not only the disbursements themselves,\n                    but also the objects for which the money had been spent, the nature of the\n                    service rendered, what the price was, in the coinage of what country the payment\n                    was made, and what the loss in exchange was, in order that I might be able to\n                    give convincing proof to my successor, if he thought any false entries were\n                    being made against him. And besides I was\n                    ready to take an oath to confirm my reckoning. Upon my giving him this\n                    challenge, he answered that he had no interest in what I was saying. At this\n                    point a servant came from the general with orders for me to set sail. The order\n                    was given to me, not to the defendant, my successor, upon whom the duty was now\n                    devolving; but the reason for this I will explain in the course of my address.\n                    For the time being it seemed to me best to weigh anchor and sail where he\n                    ordered me, but when I put into Thasos again,\n                    after towing the vessels to Strym as the general had ordered, bidding\n                    the sailors and the marines and the rowers to remain on board, I went by myself\n                    to the house where the general, Timomachus, lodged, wishing that he too should\n                    be present, when I offered the ship with her full crew to the defendant\n                    Polycles. I found the defendant there and the\n                    trierarchs and those who were to succeed them, and some others of our citizens;\n                    and on coming in I spoke at once to Polycles in the presence of the general, and\n                    called upon him to take over the ship from me, and to pay me for the\n                    disbursements made during the period since my term of service had expired; and I\n                    asked him about the ship's equipment, whether he would take it over, or whether\n                    he had brought equipment of his own with him. When I thus challenged him, he asked me why I was the only one of the\n                    trierarchs who had equipment of my own, and whether the state did not know that\n                    there were some people able to provide equipment for their ships, so that the\n                    state itself did not need to do it. Or have you, he said,\n                    so far surpassed the others in wealth as to be the only one of the\n                    trierarchs to have equipment of your own and gilded ornaments? Who, he continued, could endure\n                    your madness and extravagance, a crew corrupted and accustomed to receive large\n                    sums in advance and to enjoy exemption from services normally required on board\n                    a ship, and able also to make use of the baths, and marines and rowers rendered\n                    luxurious by high wages paid in full? Bad ways, he said,\n                    are these you have taught the army. It is partly your fault that the\n                    troops of the other trierarchs have become more unruly, seeking to have the same\n                    treatment that yours enjoy; you ought to have done the same as the other\n                    trierarchs. Upon his saying this, I\n                    answered that the reason I had taken no equipment from the docks was because,\n                    You, said I, have brought the stores into bad\n                    repute. However, if you like, take this equipment of mine; if not, provide\n                    equipment for yourself. As for the sailors and marines and rowers, if you say\n                    that they have been corrupted by me, take over the ship, and get sailors and\n                    marines and rowers for yourself, who will sail with you without pay. But take\n                    over the ship, for it is not my place to serve any longer; the term of my\n                    trierarchy has expired, and I have served four months beyond it.\n                        When I said this to him, he answered that\n                    his colleague in the trierarchy had not come to the ship.\n                    So, said he, I will not take over the ship\n                    alone. To prove that I am telling you the truth in this, that in the\n                    market-place he made the answer mentioned above, that he cared nothing for what\n                    I was saying, and that in the house where Timomachus lodged he declared that he\n                    would not take over the ship alonethe clerk shall read you the\n                    depositions bearing on these facts.\n                    After this, men\n                    of the jury, when the defendant would neither take over the ship from me nor pay\n                    the expenses for the period beyond my term, and the general ordered me to set\n                    sail, I approached him in the harbor in Thasos, and in the presence of the\n                    general, when the ship was fully manned, and made a proposal, which was not\n                    indeed fair, since the advantage was all on his side, but which was forced upon\n                    me by the circumstances. Since you\n                    say, Polycles, that your associate in the trierarchy has not come, I will get\n                    from him, if I can, the amount expended during my extra time of service, the\n                    four months; but do you take over the ship, and first serve as trierarch for\n                    your term, the six months; then, if your colleague shall have arrived in the\n                    interim, you will give over the ship, having fulfilled your term of service;\n                    and, if he does not come, you will suffer no great harm in serving two months\n                    beyond your term. Or, am I, who have served\n                    for my own term and that of my colleague, to have performed extra service as\n                    trierarch for you and your associate, and are you, who have incurred no expense,\n                    to refuse either to take over the ship and serve your own term, or to reimburse\n                    me for the expenses I have borne? When I said this, he answered that\n                    I was romancing. Then the general ordered me to go on board my ship and put to\n                    sea with him.To prove that he did give me this\n                    answer, please read the deposition.\n                    I wish now to\n                    mention a matter to you, to the end that you may understand how flagrantly I\n                    have been wronged. For about the same time Mnesilochus of Perithoidae and Phrasierides of Anaphlystus were appointed to succeed Hagnias\n                    and Praxicles. But, since Phrasierides did not arrive to join the ship,\n                    Mnesilochus went to Thasos and took over the trireme from Hagnias, and paid to Hagnias what the latter convinced him was\n                    due for the expenses he had incurred on their behalf while serving as trierarch\n                    beyond his time, and hired from Hagnias the ship's equipment, and assumed\n                    himself the duties of trierarch. Afterwards, when the men from Phrasierides\n                    came, they paid his share of the expenses to Mnesilochus, and for the remainder\n                    of the term joined in meeting whatever expenditures he required for the\n                        ship.Read, please, the deposition\n                    establishing these facts.\n                    Perhaps, now,\n                    men of the jury, you want to hear for what possible reason the general failed to\n                    compel the defendant to take over the ship, when he came to it as my successor,\n                    the laws on the matter being so strict. In regard to this I wish to show you\n                    clearly why it was. For Timomachus, men of the jury, wished above all things to\n                    have the trireme well equipped for every service. He knew, however, that the defendant, if he took over the ship,\n                    would manage wretchedly as trierarch; that he would get service neither from the\n                    crew nor the marines nor the rowers, for not one of them would stay with him.\n                    Besides, he knew that, if he ordered him to sail without giving him money, he\n                    would not put out to sea at his bidding, as I should do, but would make trouble.\n                    And in addition to this he borrowed from him thirty minae on the understanding\n                    that he would not force him to take over the ship. But why it was that he was especially incensed against me and\n                    treated me despitefully, and would never on any occasion listen to a word from\n                    me regarding any matter, I wish to show you clearly, that you may understand\n                    that I cared less at that time for my own comfort or for the general's power\n                    than for the people of Athens and the laws, and that I endured ill-treatment and\n                    abuse, which were far more grievous to me than the expenses I incurred.\n                        For, while the fleet was lying at Thasos,\n                    a despatch-boat came from Methon in Macedonia to Thasos, bringing a\n                    man with letters from Callistratus to Timomachus, which, as I afterward learned,\n                    contained a request that he should send the swiftest-sailing ship he had to\n                    bring Callistratus to him. At once, then, at daybreak the next morning, the\n                    officer from the general came and ordered me to summon my crew to the ship.\n                        When it was manned, Callippus, the son of\n                    Philon, of Aexon, came on board, and ordered the pilot to steer the\n                    course for Macedonia. When we had reached a place on the opposite mainland, a\n                    trading post of the Thasians, and had gone ashore and were getting our dinner,\n                    one of the sailors, Callicles, the son of Epitrephes, of Thria, came up to\n                    me, and said that he wished to speak to me about a matter which concerned\n                    myself. I bade him speak on, and he said that he wanted to make what return he\n                    could for the help I had given him in his need. Do you know, then, he asked, for what purpose\n                    you are making this voyage, and where you are going? When I replied\n                    that I did not know, he said, Then I will tell you; for you must\n                    learn this in order to plan your action aright. You are going, said\n                    he, to bring Callistratus, an exile whom the Athenians have twice\n                    condemned to death, from Methon to Thasos to Timomachus, his kinsman\n                    by marriage. I have found this out, he said, from the\n                    servants of Callippus. For your own part, then, if you are wise, you will not\n                    permit any exile to come on board the ship; for the laws forbid it.\n                        On hearing this from Callicles, I\n                    approached Callippus, and asked him to what place he was sailing, and whom he\n                    was going to fetch. He spoke roughly to me and threatened me in a way you can\n                    easily understand for you are not without experience of the ways of\n                    Callippus, and I said to him, I hear that you are sailing\n                    to fetch Callistratus. Now, I will transport no exile, nor will I go to fetch\n                    him; for the laws forbid anyone to give harborage to any exile, and make one who\n                    does so liable to the same punishment. I shall, therefore, sail back to the\n                    general in Thasos. So, when the\n                    sailors came on board, I ordered the pilot to sail back to Thasos. Callippus\n                    protested, and bade him sail for Macedonia in accordance with the general's\n                    commands; but Posidippus, the pilot, answered him that I was trierarch of the\n                    ship, and the one responsible, and that he got his pay from me; he would sail,\n                    therefore, whither I bade him sailto Thasos, to the general.\n                        When we reached Thasos the next day,\n                    Timomachus sent for me to come to the place where he lodged outside the wall. I\n                    was afraid that he would put me under arrest on false charges preferred by\n                    Callippus, so did not obey the summons in person, but told the officer that, if\n                    he had anything to say to me, I should be in the market-place; and I sent my\n                    servant with him, in order that, if the general had any orders to give he might\n                    hear and report to me. It was for this reason,\n                    which I have stated to you, men of the jury, that Timomachus did not force the\n                    defendant to take over the ship, and besides, he wanted the use of the ship for\n                    himself, as she was the best sailer. As for the trireme of Thrasylochus of\n                        Anagyrus, on board which he was himself sailing, he induced\n                    Thrasylochus to let his trierarchy to Callippus, that Callippus, being in full\n                    control of the ship, might carry Callistratus about, as he pleased. Timomachus\n                    himself came on board my ship, and sailed around here and there until he reached\n                    the Hellespont. When he had no longer need of ships of war, he put on board my vessel Eucinus\n                    of Pallen, as commander, and, enjoining upon him to give the sailors\n                    money every day, ordered me to sail for home. When, then, on our homeward voyage\n                    we were in Tenedos, and Lucinus, despite the orders given him by Timomachus, was\n                    furnishing no money for sustenance to the sailors he said he had none,\n                    but should get some from Mytilen, and the men had nothing\n                    with which to buy provisions, and without food could not have continued rowing,\n                        again taking some of our citizens as\n                    witnesses I approached the defendant in Tenedos, and bade him take over the ship\n                    as my successor, and to reimburse me for the expenses I had incurred while I\n                    serving as trierarch in his stead beyond my term. I did this in order that he\n                    might not make use of the pretext, in his defence before you, that I refused to\n                    hand over the ship to him because I was ambitious to sail home in a fast-sailing\n                    ship and show off to you my lavish expenditure. Since he refused to take over the ship, and the sailors were asking for money\n                    that they might buy supplies, I came up to him again, having witnesses with me,\n                    and asked whether he had come out with money with the purpose of taking over the\n                    ship from me, or not. On his replying that he had brought money with him, I\n                    urged him to lend me some on the security of the ship's equipment, that I might\n                    distribute it among the sailors and bring the ship home, seeing that he refused\n                    to take over the ship, although he was my successor. To this request of mine he replied that he would not lend me a\n                    farthing. Accordingly I borrowed from Cleanax and Eperatus, friends of my father\n                    in Tenedos, and gave the sailors their provision-money; for on account of my\n                    being Pasion's son, and the fact that he was connected by ties of hospitality\n                    with many, and was trusted throughout the Greek world, I had no difficulty in\n                    borrowing money wherever I needed it.To prove\n                    that the statements I am making to you are true, I shall produce for you the\n                    depositions establishing these facts.\n                    The clerk has\n                    read the depositions of all those whom I was able to produce, who were present\n                    in person, to prove that I again and again offered to give over the ship to\n                    Polycles, and that he refused to take it. More than that, I have shown by\n                    convincing circumstantial evidence, why it was that he refused to take over the\n                    ship. I desire now to have read to you the law also regarding those appointed to\n                    succeed others in the trierarchy, that you may know how severe the penalties are\n                    when a man fails to take over a ship from his predecessor within the appointed\n                    time, and how Polycles scoffed, not at me only, but at you and at the laws.\n                        So far as he is concerned, all measures\n                    undertaken by the state and her allies have failed; for he neither joined his\n                    ship, as the law commands, nor, when he did come, was he willing to take over\n                    the ship from his predecessor; whereas I served for my own term and that of my\n                    associate in the trierarchy, and when my term of service had expired and I was\n                    ordered by the general to sail to Hieron, I convoyed the grain for our people,\n                        that they might buy in a plentiful market,\n                    and that, so far as depended on me, there should be no lack; and I performed for\n                    the general every other service which he desired either of myself or of my\n                    trireme, not only spending my property, but risking my life as well through\n                    always making the voyage in person, although my domestic affairs were in such a\n                    condition at that time that you would pity me, if you heard them. My mother lay sick, and was at\n                    the point of death while I was abroad, so that she was unable any longer to help\n                    in the depletion of my resources save to a slight extent. I had been but six\n                    days at home, when, after she had seen and greeted me, she breathed her last,\n                    being no longer mistress of her property, so as to give me I as much as she\n                    wished. She had often sent for me before this, begging me to come to her by\n                    myself if I could not come in my ship. My\n                    wife, too, to whom I am deeply attached, was in poor health for a long time\n                    during my absence; my children were small and my estate was in debt; my land not\n                    only produced no crops, but that year, as you all know, the water even dried up\n                    in the wells, so that not a vegetable grew in the garden; and my creditors at\n                    the expiration of the year came to collect their interest, unless the principal\n                    was paid to them according to the contract. When I heard these facts from the lips of those who came and also through\n                    letters from my relatives, how do you think I must have felt, and how many tears\n                    must I have shed, while I reckoned up my present troubles and was longing to see\n                    my children and my wife, and my mother whom I had little hope of finding alive?\n                    For what is sweeter to a man than these, or why should one wish to live, if\n                    deprived of them? Although the misfortunes which had befallen me were thus\n                    grievous, I did not count my private interests of so much importance as your\n                    interests, but felt that I ought to rise above the wasting of my fortune, the\n                    neglect of my household affairs, and the sickness of my wife and my mother, so\n                    that no one could accuse me of deserting my post or letting my ship be useless\n                    to the state. In return for all this I now\n                    implore you, that, as I showed myself obedient and useful in your service, so\n                    you will now take thought of me, and, remembering all that I have told you, the\n                    depositions which I have produced and the decrees, you will succor me when I am\n                    being wronged, will mete out punishment in your own interest, and will exact\n                    repayment of the funds expended in the defendant's behalf. Or who will wish to\n                    be zealous on your service, when men see that you neither reward those who are\n                    honest and obedient, nor punish those who are dishonest and disobedient?\n                        The clerk shall read you the law and an\n                    account of my expenses in detail for the period during which I served as\n                    trierarch beyond my term on the defendant's behalf, and the sums which the\n                    several deserters took with them when they ran away from the ship, and where\n                    they went, in order that you may be assured that neither now nor at any time\n                    before have I made false statements to you. I count it my duty to serve you in a\n                    manner above reproach for the period prescribed by law, and as regards those who\n                    scorn you and the laws, and will not obey the laws, to convict them and get them\n                    punished in your courts. Be assured that it\n                    will be no more in my interest than in your own that you will punish Polycles,\n                    nor will you be showing concern merely for those who have served as trierarchs\n                    in the past; no, you will be taking thought also for those who are to serve in\n                    the future, so that those who perform public services may not be discouraged,\n                    and those who are designated as their successors may not show contempt toward\n                    the laws, but may go to their ships when they are appointed. These matters you\n                    should bear in mind, and reach a fair and just decision regarding all the points\n                    at issue. I\n                    should gladly ask you, men of the jury, what opinion you would have had of me,\n                    if, when my term of service had expired and the defendant had not come to take\n                    over the ship, I had refused to serve longer when the general so ordered, but\n                    had sailed away. Would you not have been indignant and have thought that I was\n                    wronging you? If, then, you would have been indignant in that case, because I\n                    refused to serve beyond my term, should you not now exact from the defendant the\n                    money expended by me on his behalf, seeing that he did not take over the ship?\n                        To prove\n                    that it is not in my case only that he failed to take over his ship, but that on\n                    a former occasion also, when he was the associate of Euripides in the trierarchy\n                    and there was an agreement between them that each should sail for six months,\n                    when Euripides had sailed and the term had expired, Polycles did not take over\n                    the ship from him,to prove this, I say, the clerk shall read the\n                        deposition."}}]}}}}
