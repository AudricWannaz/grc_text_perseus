It has\n\t\t    had the bad fortune to become a literary problem, and\n\t\t    almost all its few readers are so much occupied with\n\t\t    the question whether it can be the work of Euripides\n\t\t    -and if not his, whose?-that they seldom allow themselves to take it on its merits as a stirring and adventurous piece, not particularly profound or subtle,\n\t\t    but always full of movement and life and possessing at\n\t\t    least one or two scenes of great and penetrating\n\t\t    beauty.", "The outlines of the Rhesus Question are these.\n\t\t    The Rhesus appears in the MSS. of Euripides; we\n\t\t    know from the Athenian Didascaliae, or Records of\n\t\t    Performances, that Euripides wrote a play of the\n\t\t    name; some passages in it are quoted by early\n\t\t    Alexandrian writers as from \"the Rhesus of Euripides;\" no passage is quoted under any other name.\n\t\t    This seems about as strong as external evidence\n\t\t    need be. Yet the ancient introduction to the play\n\t\t    mentions that \"some think the play spurious,\" and\n\t\t    expresses the odd opinion that \" it suggests rather the\n\t\t    Sophoclean style.\"  Further, it tells us that, besides\n\t\t    the present opening scene, there were extant two different prologues, one of which was \"quite prosy and\n\t\t    perhaps concocted by the actors.\" This seems to show\n\t\t    that the Alexandrian scholars who tried for the first\n\t\t    time to collect the complete works of Euripides, some\n\t\t    two centuries after his death, found this play current\n\t\t    as \" Euripides' Rhesus,\" but that it was credited with\n\t\t    three different openings and that its style was felt to\n\t\t    be somehow peculiar.", "The peculiarity of style is incontestable.  It does\n\t\t    not to our judgment suggest Sophocles. It suggests a\n\t\t    young man imitating Aeschylus, and it has a great\n\t\t    number of Euripidean expressions.    Hermann, who\n\t\t    collected what he took to be \"imitations\" of early\n\t\t    poets in the Rhesus, noted only 25 of Sophocles, 38\n\t\t    of Aeschylus, and 84 of Euripides.", "Is it, then, the work of a somewhat imitative fourth-century poet, naturally influenced by his great forerunners?  Hardly: because, with a few   exceptions,\n\t\t    the verse and diction of the Rhesus, are markedly early\n\t\t    in character, the verse severe and smooth, the diction\n\t\t    direct and rather grandiose, the choral lyrics strictly\n\t\t    relevant. In Euripides' later years Drama was moving\n\t\t    rapidly away from all these things and, as far as we\n\t\t    can judge, continued so moving after his death. If\n\t\t    the Rhesus is a post-classical play it can hardly be\n\t\t    honest fourth-century work: it must be deliberately\n\t\t    archaistic, a product of the Alexandrian spirit if not\n\t\t    actually of the Alexandrian age. This is what Hermann believed.   But unfortunately it is not a bit\n\t\t    more like our fragments of Alexandrian tragedy than\n\t\t    it is like the Medea; and, further, if it is an Alexandrian pseudo-classic tragedy, how did it succeed in\n\t\t    deceiving the Alexandrian critics, detectives specially\n\t\t    trained for this kind of work?", {"date": {"@value": "-438", "#text": "438"}, "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,5004252", "#text": "Aulis"}, {"@key": "tgn,5004252", "#text": "Aulis"}], "#text": "Let us try quite a different hypothesis, and begin by\n\t\t    accepting the external evidence as true. The famous\n\t\t    critic, Crates, of the second century B.C., happens to\n\t\t    mention-in excuse of what he took to be a slip in the\n\t\t    poet's astronomy-that the Rhesus of Euripides was\n\t\t    a youthful work. Now the earliest dated tragedy of\n\t\t    Euripides that we possess is the Alcestis, B.C. ,\n\t\t    written when he was about forty-six. His style\n\t\t    may well have been considerably different fifteen or\n\t\t    twenty years earlier, and must certainly have been\n\t\t    much under the influence of Aeschylus.   So far, so\n\t\t    good. Then what of the other difficulties, the three\n\t\t    different opening scenes and the few passages of late\n\t\t    phrasing or technique?    One obvious explanation\n\t\t    suits both.   The three different openings pretty\n\t\t    clearly imply that the play was reproduced more than\n\t\t    once after the poet's death and adapted by the producer\n\t\t    for each occasion. This happened to many plays of\n\t\t    Euripides, and in one case we even know the name of\n\t\t    the producer; he was Euripides the Younger, son of\n\t\t    the poet. Among other things we have reason to believe that he wrote some parts of the Iphigenia in\n\t\t    . And in this connexion we can hardly help\n\t\t    noticing that the Iphigenia in , like the Rhesus\n\t\t    and like no other Greek tragedy, has two alternative\n\t\t    openings, one a dull prologue and one a lyrical scene\n\t\t    in anapaests under the stars. The general style of the\n\t\t    two plays is utterly different; the Iphigenia is most\n\t\t    typically late Euripidean; but one would not be surprised to learn that they had both passed at some time\n\t\t    through the same revising hand."}, "This hypothesis seems to work well. But one\n\t\t    difficulty remains.", "We have so far gone on the supposition that\n\t\t    Euripides at twenty-five or thirty perhaps wrote very\n\t\t    differently from Euripides at forty-six, and that the\n\t\t    manner we call Euripidean is only the manner of\n\t\t    his later life. There is nothing improbable in this\n\t\t    suggestion, but have we any evidence? Yes, a very\n\t\t    little, and unfortunately it does not say what we\n\t\t    want. We have some fragments-twenty lines altogether-preserved   from  the Peliades, with   which\n\t\t    Euripides won his first victory in the year 455, seventeen years before the Alcestis, and as far as they go\n\t\t    they are just in his ordinary manner-a good deal\n\t\t    more so, in fact, than much of the Alcestis is. Let us\n\t\t    face this difficulty.", {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,2236678", "#text": "Cyclops"}, {"@key": "tgn,2236678", "#text": "Cyclops"}, {"@key": "tgn,2236678", "#text": "Cyclops"}], "#text": "The ordinary style of Euripides is full, flexible,\n\t\t    lucid, antithetic, studiously simple in vocabulary and\n\t\t    charged with philosophic reflection. If we look in his\n\t\t    extant remains for any trace of a style, like that of\n\t\t    the Rhesus, which is comparatively terse, rich,\n\t\t    romantic, not shrinking from rare words and strong\n\t\t    colour and generally untinged by philosophy, we shall\n\t\t    find the nearest approach to it in the . Next to\n\t\t    the  I am not sure what play would come, but the\n\t\t    Alcestis would not be far off.        It has especially\n\t\t    several Epic forms which cannot be paralleled in\n\t\t    tragedy. Now the conjunction of these two plays with\n\t\t    the Rhesus is significant. The three seem to be three\n\t\t    earliest of the extant plays; they are also- if we\n\t\t    count the Heraclidae as mutilated-the three shortest.\n\t\t    But, what is more important, the  is not a\n\t\t    tragedy but a satyr-play, and the Alcestis is a tragedy\n\t\t    of a special sort, written to take the place of a\n\t\t    satyr-play. It is a tragedy with some half grotesque\n\t\t    figures and a fantastic atmosphere."}, {"date": [{"@value": "1419", "#text": "1419"}, {"@value": "1163", "#text": "1163"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,2236678", "#text": "Cyclops"}, {"@key": "tgn,2236678", "#text": "Cyclops"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003867", "#text": "Aetna"}, {"@key": "tgn,2236678", "#text": "Cyclops"}], "#text": "This is no place for a close analysis of the diction of\n\t\t    the various works of Euripides; but taking one rough\n\t\t    test, just for what it is worth, we may try to count\n\t\t    the number of words in each play which are not found\n\t\t    elsewhere in Euripides. The Medea, a central sort of\n\t\t    play, has in its  lines 103 such words. The\n\t\t    Alcestis, with  lines, has 122; the Rhesus, with\n\t\t    less than 1000 lines, has 177; the , with only\n\t\t    701 lines, has actually 220. This calculation is\n\t\t    doubtless slightly inexact: in any case it is worth\n\t\t    very little until it is carefully analysed. But on the\n\t\t    whole it accords with my general impression that the\n\t\t    Rhesus in its variation from the Euripidean norm goes\n\t\t    further than the Alcestis, and not so far as the\n\t\t    , and goes in very much the same direction. I\n\t\t    feel in the Rhesus a good deal of that curious\n\t\t    atmosphere, not exactly comic, but wild and\n\t\t    extravagant, which the Greeks felt to be suited to the\n\t\t    Satyr horde; the atmosphere normally breathed by the\n\t\t    one-eyed Giant of the cavern on volcanic , or the\n\t\t    drunken and garlanded Heracles who wrestles with Death\n\t\t    and cracks his ribs for him at midnight among the\n\t\t    tombs.  The whole scene and setting of the Rhesus; the\n\t\t    man-wolf crawling away into the darkness and his two\n\t\t    enemies presently crawling in out of the same darkness\n\t\t    with his bloody spoils; the divine Thracian king with\n\t\t    his round targe that shines by night and his horses\n\t\t    whiter than the snow; the panic of the watch, the\n\t\t    vaunting of the doomed chieftain, the goddess disguised\n\t\t    as another goddess, the thrilling half-farcical scene\n\t\t    where the spy Odysseus is actually caught and befools\n\t\t    his captors: these things are not of course comic, like\n\t\t    some incidents in the . They belong to tragedy;\n\t\t    but they are near the outside limit of the tragic\n\t\t    convention, and would perhaps be most at home in a\n\t\t    pro-satyric tragedy like the Alcestis."}, "In the upshot I see no adequate reason for rejecting\n\t\t    the external evidence which makes this play a work of\n\t\t    Euripides, if we suppose it to be an early pro-satyric\n\t\t    play which was produced again after the poet's death\n\t\t    by Euripides the Younger or some contemporary.\n\t\t    Most scholars, however, prefer to think it simply an\n\t\t    archaistic work of the fourth century.", "On this theory the Alexandrians when looking for\n\t\t    the Rhesus of Euripides found an anonymous play\n\t\t    called Rhesus and accepted it for what it was worth.\n\t\t    The Prologues mentioned in the argument would\n\t\t    perhaps belong to other plays of the same name;\n\t\t    one, no doubt, to the real play of Euripides. The\n\t\t    rich and severe style may, for all we know-for\n\t\t    direct evidence fails us-be the natural work of some\n\t\t    reactionary archaistic school about the time of Plato\n\t\t    or Aristotle. The same date might well be indicated by the great interest our play takes in the\n\t\t    Iliad, and by its almost \"Alexandrian\" use of\n\t\t    the gods as ornamental machinery. I cannot call such\n\t\t    a theory improbable; but it really amounts to rejecting the external evidence in order to place the Rhesus\n\t\t    in a period of tragic style of which we happen to\n\t\t    know  nothing.  It is certainly not confirmed by\n\t\t    the scanty fragments we possess of Theodectes or\n\t\t    Chairemon.", "And, if one is to venture into more speculative\n\t\t    and subjective arguments, I find it rather hard to\n\t\t    think of any lyric poet except Euripides who could\n\t\t    have written the Adrasteia chorus or the lines about\n\t\t    the Nightingale in the Watchers' Song; of any playwright except Euripides who would have ended a\n\t\t    play of gallant martial adventure with the vision of a\n\t\t    solitary mother clasping her dead son. There are\n\t\t    many other passages, too, like the mysterious sobbing\n\t\t    in the dark that heralds the entry of the wounded\n\t\t    Thracian, and the final passing out of the army to its\n\t\t    certain defeat, which seem to me more like undeveloped genius than common imitative mediocrity. If\n\t\t    a nameless fourth-century poet wrote this play, I think\n\t\t    we should have heard more of him.", "The story of the play is taken straight from the\n\t\t    Doloneia, an Epic rhapsody which now takes its place\n\t\t    as the Tenth Book of the Iliad, but was very likely\n\t\t    independent in the time of Euripides (Rise of the\n\t\t    Greek Epic, p. 313 f.). The play seems in one or\n\t\t    two points to follow a more archaic model than the\n\t\t    version in our Homer.

Then watching somewhere near Hector's tent they partly express, in the usual song, the lyrical emotion of the night, partly they chat about Dolon and the order of the watches. The scene is technically very interesting with its rather abrupt introduction of realism into the high convention of tragedy. Meantime the Trojans' time of watch is over and the Lycians, who ought to watch next, have not come. In a modern army it would of course be the duty of the new watch to come and relieve the old; in an ancient barbaric army-characteristically-the old watch had to go and wake the new. You could not, one must suppose, trust them to take their turn otherwise.

The silent rush on Hector's empty tent is hard to parallel. The cruel Athena is Euripidean; but her appearance in the midst of the action is startling, though it may be paralleled from Sophocles' Ajax. In Euripides Gods are generally kept for the prologue or epilogue, away from the ordinary action. (The vision of Iris and Lyssa in the middle of the Heracles has at least the stage clear of mortals and the Chorus apparently in a kind of dream.) Again the conception of Athena pretending to be Cypris is curious.  The disguised Athena is common in the Odyssey, but she does not disguise herself as another goddess. (It is sometimes held that this scene requires four actors, which would be a decisive mark of lateness; but this is not really so.  The actor who took Odysseus could easily get round in time to take Paris also-especially if he made his exit at 1. 626, before Athena sees Paris. And the Greek stage had no objection to such doubling.) Lastly, the scene of turmoil between the spies and the Guards is extraordinary in a tragedy, though it would suit well in a pro-satyric play.

This sort of supposition is usual in all Greek tragedy. It merely\n\t\tmeans that the poet takes for granted the main outlines of the heroic saga.
