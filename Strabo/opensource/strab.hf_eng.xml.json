By observations made at Alexandria, he determined the zenith of\n\nthat place to be distant by the fiftieth part of the circumference from the\n\nsolstice, which was equivalent to saying that the arc of the meridian between the two places is 7 12. Cleomedes says that he used the \n\nor hemispherical dial of Berosus, in the determination of this latitude.\n\nDelambre rejects the idea with infinite scorn, and pronounces Cleomedes\n\nunworthy of credit; and indeed it is not easy to see why Eratosthenes\n\nshould have rejected the gnomon and the large circular instruments, unless, perhaps, for the following reason.

Pliny calls this 31,500 Roman miles, and therefore\n\nsupposes the stadium to be the eighth part of a Roman mile, or takes\n\nfor granted that Eratosthenes used the Olympic stadium. It is likely\n\nenough that the Ptolemies naturalized this stadium in Egypt; but nevertheless, it is not unlikely that an Egyptian stadium was employed. If\n\nwe assume the Olympic stadium, (202 1/4 yards,) the degree of Eratosthenes is more than 79 miles, upwards of 10 miles too great. Nothing\n\nis known of any Egyptian stadium. Pliny asserts that Hipparchus, but\n\nfor what reason he does not say, wanted to add 25,000 stadia to the circumference as found by Eratosthenes. According to Plutarch, Eratosthenes made the sun to be 804 millions of stadia from the earth, and the\n\nmoon 780,000. According to Macrobius, he made the diameter of the\n\nsun to be 27 times that of the earth. With regard to the other merits of\n\nEratosthenes, we must first of all mention what he did for geography,\n\nwhich was closely connected with his mathematical pursuits. It was\n\nEratosthenes who raised geography to the rank of a science; for previous to his time it seems to have consisted, more or less, of a mass of in-\n\nformation scattered in books of travel, descriptions of particular countries,\n\nand the like. All these treasures were accessible to Eratosthenes in the\n\nlibraries of Alexandria; and he made the most profitable use of them,\n\nby collecting the scattered materials, and uniting them into an organic\n\nsystem of geography, in his comprehensive work entitled  or\n\nas it is sometimes but erroneously called,  or  It consisted of three books, the first of which, forming a sort of Introduction, contained a critical review of the labours of his predecessors\n\nfrom the earliest to his own times, and investigations concerning the form\n\nand nature of the earth, which, according to him, was an immoveable\n\nglobe, on the surface of which traces of a series of great revolutions were\n\nstill visible. He conceived that in one of these revolutions the Mediterranean had acquired its present form; for according to him it was at one\n\ntime a large lake covering portions of the adjacent countries of Asia and\n\nLibya, until a passage was forced open by which it entered into communication with the ocean in the west. The second book contained what is\n\nnow called mathematical geography. His attempt to measure the magnitude of the earth has been spoken of above. The third book contained\n\nthe political geography, and gave descriptions of the various countries,\n\nderived from the works of earlier travellers and geographers. In order\n\nto be able to determine the accurate site of each place, he drew a line\n\nparallel with the equator, running from the Pillars of Hercules to the\n\nextreme east of Asia, and dividing the whole of the inhabited earth into\n\ntwo halves. Connected with this work was a new map of the earth, in\n\nwhich towns, mountains, rivers, lakes, and climates were marked according to his own improved measurements. This important work of Eratosthenes forms an epoch in the history of ancient geography: but unfortunately it is lost, and all that has survived consists in fragments quoted\n\nby later geographers and historians, such as Polybius, Strabo, Marcianus,\n\nPliny, and others, who often judge of him unfavourably, and controvert\n\nhis statements; while it can be proved that in a great many passages they\n\nadopt his opinions without mentioning his name. Marcianus charges\n\nEratosthenes with having copied the substance of the work of Timosthenes on Ports, () to which he added but very little of his\n\nown. This charge may be well-founded, but cannot have diminished the\n\nvalue of the work of Eratosthenes, in which that of Timosthenes can\n\nhave formed only a very small portion. It seems to have been the very\n\noverwhelming importance of the geography of Eratosthenes, that called\n\nforth a number of opponents, among whom we meet with the names of\n\nPolemon, Hipparchus, Polybius, Serapion, and Marcianus of Heracleia.\n\n* * * Another work of a somewhat similar nature, entitled  was\n\nwritten in verse, and treated of the form of the earth, its temperature,\n\nthe different zones, the constellations, and the like. * * * Eratosthenes\n\ndistinguished himself also as a philosopher, historian, grammarian, &c."}}], "#text": "This writer occupies so prominent a position in Strabo's work, that\n\nno apology I think will be needed for the following extract from Smith's\n\nDictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology."}], "pb": [{"@n": "9"}, {"@n": "10"}], "cit": {"quote": {"lg": {"l": ["With clouds and darkness veil'd, on whom the sun", "Deigns not to look with his beam-darting eye,", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "cit": {"quote": "They are covered with shadows and darkness, nor does the shining\n\nsun behold them with his beams,............ but pernicious night\n\nis spread over hapless mortals.", "bibl": "Odyssey xi. 15 and 19."}}, "#text": "But sad night canopies the woeful race."}]}}, "bibl": "Odyssey xi. 15 and 19."}, "milestone": {"@ed": "P", "@n": "11", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "Homer, besides the boundaries of the earth, which he\n\nfully describes, was likewise well acquainted with the Mediterranean.

Herein he agrees with the\n\nopinion of Strato the natural philosopher, and Xanthus of\n\nLydia. Xanthus mentioned that in the reign of Artaxerxes\n\nthere was so great a drought, that every river, lake, and well\n\nwas dried up: and that in many places he had seen a long way\n\nfrom the sea fossil shells, some like cockles, others resembling\n\nscallop shells, also salt lakes in Armenia, Matiana, and\n\nLower Phrygia, which induced him to believe that sea had\n\nformerly been where the land now was. Strato, who went more\n\ndeeply into the causes of these phenomena, was of opinion that\n\nformerly there was no exit to the Euxine as now at Byzantium, but that the rivers running into it had forced a way\n\nthrough, and thus let the waters escape into the Propontis,\n\nand thence to the Hellespont. And that a like change had\n\noccurred in the Mediterranean. For the sea being overflowed\n\nby the rivers, had opened for itself a passage by the Pillars of\n\nHercules, and thus, much that was formerly covered by water,\n\nhad been left dry. He gives as the cause of this, that anciently the levels of the Mediterranean and Atlantic were not\n\nthe same, and states that a bank of earth, the remains of\n\nthe ancient separation of the two seas, is still stretched under\n\nwater from Europe to Africa. He adds, that the Euxine is\n\nthe most shallow, and the seas of Crete, Sicily, and Sardinia\n\nmuch deeper, which is occasioned by the number of large\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrivers flowing into the Euxine both from the north and east,\n\nand so filling it up with mud, whilst the others preserve their\n\ndepth. This is the cause of the remarkable sweetness of the\n\nEuxine Sea, and of the currents which regularly set towards the\n\ndeepest part. He gives it as his opinion, that should the rivers\n\ncontinue to flow in the same direction, the Euxine will in time\n\nbe filled up [by the deposits], since already the left side of the\n\nsea is little else than shallows, as also Salmydessus, and the\n\nshoals at the mouth of the Ister, and the desert of Scythia,\n\nwhich the sailors call the Breasts. Probably too the temple of\n\nAmmon was originally close to the sea, though now, by the continual deposit of the waters, it is quite inland: and he conjectures that it was owing to its being so near the sea that it became so celebrated and illustrious, and that it never would have\n\nenjoyed the credit it now possesses had it always been equally\n\nremote from the sea. Egypt too [he says] was formerly\n\ncovered by sea as far as the marshes near Pelusium, Mount\n\nCasius, and the Lake Sirbonis. Even at the present time,\n\nwhen salt is being dug in Egypt, the beds are found under\n\nlayers of sand and mingled with fossil shells, as if this district\n\nhad formerly been under water, and as if the whole region\n\nabout Casium and Gerrha had been shallows reaching to the\n\nArabian Gulf. The sea afterwards receding left the land uncovered, and the Lake Sirbonis remained, which having afterwards forced itself a passage, became a marsh. In like\n\nmanner the borders of the Lake Mris resemble a sea-beach\n\nrather than the banks of a river. Every one will admit that\n\nformerly at various periods a great portion of the mainland\n\nhas been covered and again left bare by the sea. Likewise\n\nthat the land now covered by the sea is not all on the same\n\nlevel, any more than that whereon we dwell; which is now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuncovered and has experienced so many changes, as Eratosthenes has observed.

Consequently we must seek for an explanation of the cause\n\neither in the stratum composing the bed of the sea, or in that\n\nwhich is overflowed; we prefer to look for it in the former,\n\nsince by reason of its humidity it is more liable to shiftings\n\nand sudden changes of position, and we shall find that in these\n\nmatters the wind is the great agent after all. But, I repeat\n\nit, the immediate cause of these phenomena, is not in the fact\n\nof one part of the bed of the ocean being higher or lower than\n\nanother, but in the upheaving or depression of the strata on\n\nwhich the waters rest. Strato's hypothesis evidently originated\n\nin the belief that that which occurs in rivers is also the case in\n\nregard to the sea; viz. that there is a flow of water from the\n\nhigher places. Otherwise he would not have attempted to account for the current he observed at the Strait of Byzantium in\n\nthe manner he does, attributing it to the bed of the Euxine being\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhigher than that of the Propontis and adjoining ocean, and\n\neven attempting to explain the cause thereof: viz. that the\n\nbed of the Euxine is filled up and choked by the deposit of\n\nthe rivers which flow into it; and its waters in consequence\n\ndriven out into the neighbouring sea. The same theory he\n\nwould apply in respect to the Mediterranean and Atlantic,\n\nalleging that the bed of the former is higher than that of the\n\nlatter, in consequence of the number of rivers which flow into\n\nit, and the alluvium they carry along with them. In that case\n\nthere ought to be a like influx at the Pillars and Calpe, as\n\nthere is at Byzantium.

But he is wrong when he expresses his surprise that Eratosthenes should dare to state the distance between Pelusium and Thapsacus at 6000 stadia, when he says\n\nthere are above 8000. In proof of this he advances that the\n\nparallel of Pelusium is south of that of Babylon by more than\n\n2500 stadia, and that according to Eratosthenes (as he supposes)\n\nthe latitude of Thapsacus is above 4800 stadia north of that\n\nof Babylon; from which Hipparchus tells us it results that\n\n[between Thapsacus and Pelusium] there are more than\n\n8000 stadia.

He says, indeed, that such\n\nis the distance from Thapsacus to Babylon, but not that there\n\nis this distance between their parallels, nor yet that Thapsacus\n\nand Babylon are under the same meridian. So much the\n\ncontrary, that Hipparchus has himself pointed out, that, according to Eratosthenes, Babylon ought to be east of Thapsacus\n\nmore than 2000 stadia. We have before cited the statement\n\nof Eratosthenes, that Mesopotamia and Babylon are encircled\n\nby the Tigris and Euphrates, and that the greater portion of\n\nthe Circle is formed by this latter river, which flowing north\n\nand south takes a turn to the east, and then, returning to a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsoutherly direction, discharges itself [into the sea]. So long\n\nas it flows from north to south, it may be said to follow a\n\nsoutherly direction; but the turning towards the east and\n\nBabylon is a decided deviation from the southerly direction,\n\nand it never recovers a straight course, but forms the circuit\n\nwe have mentioned above. When he tells us that the journey\n\nfrom Babylon to Thapsacus is 4800 stadia, he adds, following\n\nthe course of the Euphrates, as if on purpose lest any one\n\nshould understand such to be the distance in a direct line, or\n\nbetween the two parallels. If this be not granted, it is altogether a vain attempt to show that if a right-angled triangle\n\nwere constructed by lines drawn from Pelusium and Thapsacus to the point where the parallel of Thapsacus intercepts\n\nthe meridian of Pelusium, that one of the lines which form the\n\nright angle, and is in the direction of the meridian, would be\n\nlonger than that forming the hypotenuse drawn from Thapsacus to Pelusium. Worthless, too, is the argument in connexion with this, being the inference from a proposition not\n\nadmitted; for Eratosthenes never asserts that from Babylon to\n\nthe meridian of the Caspian Gates is a distance of 4800\n\nstadia. We have shown that Hipparchus deduces this from\n\ndata not admitted by Eratosthenes; but desirous to controvert\n\nevery thing advanced by that writer, he assumes that from\n\nBabylon to the line drawn from the Caspian Gates to the\n\nmountains of Carmania, according to Eratosthenes' description, there are above 9000 stadia, and from thence draws his\n\nconclusions."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Gosselin makes some sensible remarks on this section; we have endeavoured to render it accurately, but much fear that the true meaning\n\nof Strabo is now obscured by corruptions in the text."}, "pb": [{"@n": "136"}, {"@n": "137"}], "milestone": {"@ed": "P", "@n": "38", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "Eratosthenes cannot, therefore, be found fault with on\n\nthese grounds; what may be objected against him is as follows.\n\nWhen you wish to give a general outline of size and configuration, you should devise for yourself some rule which\n\nmay be adhered to more or less. After having laid down\n\nthat the breadth of the space occupied by the mountains\n\nwhich run in a direction due east, as well as by the sea which\n\nreaches to the Pillars of Hercules, is 3000 stadia, would you\n\npretend to estimate different lines, which you may draw within\n\nthe breadth of that space, as one and the same line? We\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshould be more willing to grant you the power of doing so\n\nwith respect to the lines which run parallel to that space than\n\nwith those which fall upon it; and among these latter,\n\nrather with respect to those which fall within it than to\n\nthose which extend without it; and also rather for those\n\nwhich, in regard to the shortness of their extent, would not\n\npass out of the said space than for those which would. And\n\nagain, rather for lines of some considerable length than for any\n\nthing very short, for the inequality of lengths is less perceptible in great extents than the difference of configuration.\n\nFor example, if you give 3000 stadia for the breadth at the\n\nTaurus, as well as for the sea which extends to the Pillars of\n\nHercules, you will form a parallelogram entirely enclosing\n\nboth the mountains of the Taurus and the sea; if you divide it\n\nin its length into several other parallelograms, and draw first\n\nthe diagonal of the great parallelogram, and next that of\n\neach smaller parallelogram, surely the diagonal of the great\n\nparallelogram will be regarded as a line more nearly parallel\n\nand equal to the side forming the length of that figure than\n\nthe diagonal of any of the smaller parallelograms: and the\n\nmore your lesser parallelograms should be multiplied, the\n\nmore will this become evident. Certainly, it is in great\n\nfigures that the obliquity of the diagonal and its difference\n\nfrom the side forming the length are the less perceptible, so that\n\nyou would have but little scruple in taking the diagonal as\n\nthe length of the figure. But if you draw the diagonal more\n\ninclined, so that it falls beyond both sides, or at least beyond\n\none of the sides, then will this no longer be the case; and\n\nthis is the sense in which we have observed, that when you attempted to draw even in a very general way the extents of\n\nthe figures, you ought to adopt some rule. But Eratosthenes\n\ntakes a line from the Caspian Gates along the mountains,\n\nrunning as it were in the same parallel as far as the Pillars,\n\nand then a second line, starting directly from the mountains\n\nto touch Thapsacus; and again a third line from Thapsacus\n\nto the frontiers of Egypt, occupying so great a breadth. If then\n\nin proceeding you give the length of the two last lines [taken\n\ntogether] as the measure of the length of the district, you will\n\nappear to measure the length of one of your parallelograms by\n\nits diagonal.

The heteroscii are those amongst whom\n\nthe shadow always falls to the north, as with us; or to the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsouth, as amongst those who inhabit the other temperate zone.\n\nThis occurs in all those regions where the arctic circle is less\n\nthan the tropic. Where however it becomes the same as or\n\ngreater than the tropic, this shows the commencement of the\n\nperiscii, who extend thence to the pole. In regions where\n\nthe sun remains above the horizon during an entire revolution\n\nof the earth, the shadow must evidently have turned in a complete circle round the gnomon. On this account he named\n\nthem periscii. However they have nought to do with geography, inasmuch as the regions are not habitable on account\n\nof the cold, as we stated in our review of Pytheas. Nor is\n\nthere any use in determining the size of this uninhabitable\n\nregion, [it is enough to have established] that those countries,\n\nhaving the tropic for their arctic circle, are situated beneath\n\nthe circle which is described by the pole of the zodiac in the\n\ndiurnal] revolution of the earth, and that the distance between the equator and the tropic equals four-sixtieths of the\n\ngreat circle [of the earth]."}]}]}, {"@type": "book", "@n": "3", "head": ["BOOK III.", "SPAIN."], "div2": [{"@type": "chapter", "@n": "1", "head": "CHAPTER I.", "milestone": {"@ed": "P", "@n": "1", "@unit": "section"}, "p": [{"milestone": {"@ed": "P", "@n": "2", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "HAVING thus given a general view of Geography, it will\n\nnow be proper to describe each separate country in detail, as\n\nwe engaged to do.

They landed on the inside of\n\nthe straits, at a place where the city of the Exitani now stands.\n\nHere they offered sacrifices, which however not being favourable, they returned. After a time others were sent, who advanced about  stadia beyond the strait, to an island\n\nconsecrated to Hercules, and lying opposite to Onoba, a city of\n\nIberia: considering that here were the Pillars, they sacrificed\n\nto the god, but the sacrifices being again unfavourable, they\n\nreturned home. In the third voyage they reached Gades,\n\nand founded the temple in the eastern part of the island, and\n\nthe city in the west. On this account some consider that\n\nthe capes in the strait are the Pillars, others suppose Gades,\n\nwhile others again believe that they lie still farther,\n\nbeyond Gades. There are also some who think that the\n\nPillars are Calpe, and the mountain of Libya which is\n\nopposite, named Abilyx, and situated, according to Eratosthenes, amongst the Metagonians, a wandering race. Others\n\nfancy that they are two small islands near to the former, one of which is named the Island of Juno. Artemidorus\n\nspeaks both of the Island of Juno and the temple there, but\n\nmakes no mention either of mount Abilyx, or the nation of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Metagonians. Some have transported hither the Planct\n\nand the Symplgades, supposing them to be the Pillars, which\n\nPindar calls the Gates of Gades, when he says that they were\n\nthe farthest limits at which Hercules arrived. Dicarchus,\n\nEratosthenes, and Polybius, with most of the Grecians, represent the Pillars as being close to the strait, while the Iberians\n\nand Libyans place them at Gades, alleging that there is nothing at all resembling pillars close by the strait. Others\n\npretend that they are the pillars of brass eight cubits high in\n\nthe temple of Hercules at Gades, on which is inscribed the\n\ncost of erecting that edifice; and that the sailors coming there\n\non the completion of their voyage and sacrificing to Hercules,\n\nrendered the place so famous that it came to be regarded as\n\nthe termination of the land and sea. Posidonius thinks this\n\nview the most probable of all, and looks upon the oracle and\n\nthe several expeditions as a Phoenician invention. As for\n\nthe expeditions, what matters it whether any one should vehemently deny or credit the account, as neither the one nor the\n\nother would be inconsistent with reason: but the assertion\n\nthat neither the little islands, nor yet the mountains, bear\n\nmuch resemblance to pillars, and that we should seek for\n\npillars, strictly so called, [set up] either as the termination of the habitable earth, or of the expedition of Hercules, has at all events some reason in it; it being an ancient usage to set up such boundary marks. As for instance\n\nthe small column which the inhabitants of Rhegium erected by\n\nthe Strait of Sicily, which is indeed a little tower; and the\n\ntower called after Pelorus, which is situated opposite to this\n\nsmall column; also the structures called altars of the Philni,\n\nabout midway in the land between the Syrtes; likewise it is\n\nrecorded, that a certain pillar was formerly erected on the\n\nIsthmus of Corinth, which the Ionians who took possession of\n\nAttica and Megaris when they were driven out of the Peloponnesus, and those who settled in the Peloponnesus, set up\n\nin common, and inscribed on the side next Megaris,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand on the opposite,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexander too erected altars as boundaries of his Indian campaign in those parts of the Indies he arrived at, which were\n\nsituated farthest towards the east, in imitation of Hercules and\n\nBacchus.

Similarly\n\nthey say that in India neither the pillars of Hercules or Bacchus are to be seen, nevertheless certain localities being described and pointed out to the Macedonians, they believed that\n\nthose places were the pillars in which they discovered any\n\ntrace either of the adventures of Bacchus or Hercules. In\n\nthe instance before us, it is not improbable that they who first\n\n[visited these regions], set up boundary marks fashioned by\n\nthe hand of man, such as altars, towers, and pillars, in the most\n\nremarkable situations, to indicate the farthest distance they had\n\nreached, (and straits, the surrounding mountains, and little\n\nislands, are indubitably the most remarkable situations for\n\npointing out the termination or commencement of places,) and\n\nthat after these human monuments had decayed, their names\n\ndescended to the places [where they had stood]; whether that\n\nwere the little islands or the capes forming the strait. This\n\nlatter point it would not be easy now to determine; the name\n\nwould suit either place, as they both bear some resemblance\n\nto pillars; I say bear some resemblance, because they are placed\n\nin such situations as might well indicate boundaries. Now\n\nthis strait is styled a mouth, as well as many others, but the\n\nmouth is at the beginning to those sailing into the strait, and\n\nto those who are quitting it at the end. The little islands at\n\nthe mouth having a contour easy to describe, and being remarkable, one might not improperly compare to pillars. In\n\nlike manner the mountains overlooking the strait are promi-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnent, resembling columns or pillars. So too Pindar might very\n\njustly have said,  if he had in mind\n\nthe pillars at the mouth; for these mouths are very similar to\n\ngates. On the other hand, Gades is not in a position to indicate an extremity, but is situated about the middle of a long\n\ncoast forming a kind of gulf. The supposition that the pillars of the temple of Hercules in Gades are intended, appears\n\nto me still less probable. It seems most likely that the name\n\nwas originally conferred not by merchants, but generals, its\n\ncelebrity afterwards became universal, as was the case with\n\nthe Indian pillars. Besides, the inscription recorded refutes\n\nthis idea, since it contains no religious dedication, but a mere\n\nlist of expenses; whereas the pillars of Hercules should have\n\nbeen a record of the hero's wonderful deeds, not of Phoenician\n\nexpenditure."}, {"pb": {"@n": "259"}, "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)n toi=s pao|ado/cois,"}, "q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "Les ouvrages qui traitent des choses merveilleuses."}, "#text": "The text is  which Gosselin renders,"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Strabo's argument is here so weak, that one can hardly believe it\n\ncan have ever been seriously made use of."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "emph": {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "lege"}, "#text": "Neque adhuc satis cognitum est, anhelitune suo id\n\nmundus efficiat, retractamque cum spiritu regerat undam undique, si, ut\n\ndoctioribus placet, unum ( universum) animal est; an sint depressi\n\naliqui specus, quo reciprocata maria residant, atque unde se rursus exuberantia attollant: an luna causas tantis meatibus prbeat."}, "#text": "This method of explaining the ebb and flow of the sea, by comparing\n\nit to the respiration of animals, is not so extraordinary, when we remember that it was the opinion of many philosophers that the universe was\n\nitself an animal.

He assigns as the cause of this phenomenon, that air\n\nrises from the interior to the surface of the earth; when this\n\nsurface is covered by the waves, at the rising of the sea, the\n\nair is deprived of its ordinary vents, and returns to the interior, stopping up the passages of the spring, and causing a\n\nwant of water, but when the surface is again laid bare, the\n\nair having a direct exit liberates the channels which feed\n\nthe spring, so that it gushes freely. Artemidorus rejects\n\nthis explanation, and substitutes one of his own, recording at\n\nthe same time the opinion of the historian Silanus; but neither one or other of their views seems to me worth relating,\n\nsince both he and Silanus were ignorant in regard to these\n\nmatters. Posidonius asserts that the entire account is false,\n\nand adds that there are two wells in the temple of Hercules,\n\nand a third in the city. That the smaller of the two in the\n\ntemple of Hercules, if drawn from frequently, will become for\n\na time exhausted, but that on ceasing to draw from it, it fills\n\nagain: while in regard to the larger, it may be drawn from\n\nduring the whole day; that it is true it becomes lower, like\n\nall other wells, but that it fills again during the night when\n\ndrawing ceases. [He adds] that the ebb tide frequently happening to occur during the period of its re-filling, gave rise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto the groundless belief of the inhabitants as to its being\n\naffected in an opposite manner [to the tides of the ocean].\n\nHowever it is not only related by him that it is a commonly\n\nbelieved fact, but we have received it from tradition as much\n\nreferred to amongst paradoxes. We have likewise heard\n\nthat there are wells both within the city and also in the gardens without, but that on account of the inferiority of this\n\nwater, tanks are generally constructed throughout the city for\n\nthe supply of water: whether likewise any of these reservoirs\n\ngive any signs of being affected in an opposite manner to the\n\ntides, we know not. If such be the case, the causes thereof\n\nshould be received as amongst phenomena hard to be explained. It is likely that Polybius may have assigned the\n\nproper reason; but it is also likely that certain of the channels of the springs being damped outside become relaxed, and\n\nso let the water run out into the surrounding land, instead of\n\nforcing it along its ancient passage to the spring; and there\n\nwill of course be moisture when the tide overflows. But if,\n\nas Athenodorus asserts, the ebb and flow resemble the inspiration and expiration of the breath, it is possible that some\n\nof the currents of water which naturally have an efflux on to\n\nthe surface of the earth, through various channels, the mouths\n\nof which we denominate springs and fountains, are by other\n\nchannels drawn towards the depths of the sea, and raise it, so\n\nas to produce a flood-tide; when the expiration is sufficient,\n\nthey leave off the course in which they are then flowing, and\n\nagain revert to their former direction, when that again takes a\n\nchange."}, {"pb": [{"@n": "260"}, {"@n": "261"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Thirty degrees."}, "milestone": {"@ed": "P", "@n": "9", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "I cannot tell how it is that Posidonius, who describes the\n\nPhnicians as sagacious in other things, should here attribute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto them folly rather than shrewdness. The sun completes his\n\nrevolution in the space of a day and night, being a portion of\n\nthe time beneath the earth, and a portion of the time shining\n\nupon it. Now he asserts that the motion of the sea corresponds\n\nwith the revolution of the heavenly bodies, and experiences\n\na diurnal, monthly, and annual change, in strict accordance\n\nwith the changes of the moon. For [he continues] when the\n\nmoon is elevated one sign of the zodiac above the horizon,\n\nthe sea begins sensibly to swell and cover the shores, until\n\nshe has attained her meridian; but when that satellite begins\n\nto decline, the sea again retires by degrees, until the moon\n\nwants merely one sign of the zodiac from setting; it then remains stationary until the moon has set, and also descended\n\none sign of the zodiac below the horizon, when it again rises\n\nuntil she has attained her meridian below the earth; it then\n\nretires again until the moon is within one sign of the zodiac of\n\nher rising above the horizon, when it remains stationary until\n\nthe moon has risen one sign of the zodiac above the earth,\n\nand then begins to rise as before. Such he describes to be the\n\ndiurnal revolution. In respect to the monthly revolution, [he\n\nsays] that the spring-tides occur at the time of the new moon,\n\nwhen they decrease until the first quarter; they then increase\n\nuntil full moon, when they again decrease until the last quarter, after which they increase till the new moon; [he adds]\n\nthat these increases ought to be understood both of their duration and speed. In regard to the annual revolution, he says\n\nthat he learned from the statements of the Gaditanians, that\n\nboth the ebb and flow tides were at their extremes at the\n\nsummer solstice: and that hence he conjectured that they decreased until the [autumnal] equinox; then increased till the\n\nwinter solstice; then decreased again until the vernal equinox;\n\nand [finally] increased until the summer solstice.

Of the wisdom of the Massilians and the simplicity of\n\ntheir life, the following will not be thought an insignificant\n\nproof. The largest dowry amongst them consists of one hundred gold pieces, with five for dress, and five more for golden\n\nornaments. More than this is not lawful.

Commencing at Marseilles, and proceeding to the country between the Alps and the Rhone, to\n\nthe river Durance, dwell the Salyes for a space of 500 stadia.\n\nFrom thence you proceed in a ferry-boat to the city of Caballio; beyond this the whole country belongs to the Cavari\n\nas far as the junction of the Isre with the Rhone; it is here\n\ntoo that the Cevennes approach the Rhone. From the Durance\n\nto this point is a distance of 700 stadia. The Salyes occupy\n\nthe plains and mountains above these. The Vocontii, Tricorii, Icomi, and Medylli, lie above the Cavari. Between\n\nthe Durance and the Isre there are other rivers which flow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom the Alps into the Rhone; two of these, after having\n\nflowed round the city of the Cavari, discharge themselves by\n\na common outlet into the Rhone.

The whole of this country consists of plains abounding in pasturage, excepting on the route from Aria to Avenio,\n\nwhere there are narrow defiles and woods to traverse. It was\n\nat the point where the river Isre and the Rhone unite near\n\nthe Cevennes, that Quintus Fabius Maximus milianus, with\n\nscarcely 30,000 men, cut to pieces 200,000 Kelts.

The distance\n\nby land [from this latter city] to Lugdunum, passing through\n\nthe country of the Allobroges, is about 200 stadia, and rather\n\nmore by water. Formerly the Allobroges engaged in war,\n\ntheir armies consisting of many myriads; they now occupy\n\nthemselves in cultivating the plains and valleys of the Alps.\n\nThey dwell generally in villages, the most notable of them inhabiting Vienne, which was merely a village, although\n\ncalled the metropolis of their nation; they have now improved\n\nand embellished it as a city; it is situated on the Rhone. So\n\nfull and rapid is the descent of this river from the Alps, that\n\nthe flow of its waters through Lake Leman may be distinguished for many stadia. Having descended into the plains\n\nof the countries of the Allobroges, and Segusii, it falls into\n\nthe Saone, near to Lugdunum, a city of the Segusii. The\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaone rises in the Alps, and separates the Sequani, the dui,\n\nand the Lincasii.

Of this those who\n\nare now called the Tectosages afford us proof, for [Phrygia contains] three nations, one of them dwelling near to the city of\n\nAncyra, being called the Tectosages; the remaining two, the\n\nTrocmi and Tolistobogii. The resemblance these nations bear\n\nto the Tectosages is evidence of their having immigrated from\n\nKeltica, though we are unable to say from which district they\n\ncame, as there does not appear to be any people at the present\n\ntime bearing the name of Trocmi or Tolistobogii, who in-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhabit either beyond the Alps, the Alps themselves, or on this\n\nside the Alps. It would seem that continual emigration has\n\ndrained them completely from their native country, a circumstance which has occurred to many other nations, as some\n\nsay that the Brennus, who led an expedition to Delphi, was a\n\nleader of the Prausi; but we are unable to say where the Prausi\n\nformerly inhabited.

And that it was\n\nfor daring to touch these that Cpio terminated so miserably\n\nhis existence, being driven from his country as a plunderer of\n\nthe temples of the gods, and leaving behind him his daughters,\n\nwho, as Timagenes informs us, having been wickedly violated,\n\nperished miserably. However, the account given by Posidonius is the more credible. He tells us that the wealth found\n\nin Toulouse amounted to somewhere about 15,000 talents, a part\n\nof which was hidden in the chapels, and the remainder in the\n\nsacred lakes, and that it was not coined [money], but gold and\n\nsilver in bullion. But at this time the temple of Delphi was\n\nemptied of these treasures, having been pillaged by the\n\nPhocans at the period of the Sacred war and supposing any\n\nto have been left, it would have been distributed amongst\n\nmany.

Then from Luna to Pisa there are more than\n\n400 stadia; from thence to Volaterr 280; thence to Pop-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlonium 270; and from Poplonium to Cossa near 800, or as\n\nsome say, 600. Polybius, however, says that there are not in\n\nall . Of these Luna is a city and harbour; it is named by\n\nthe Greeks, the harbour and city of Selene. The city is not\n\nlarge, but the harbour is very fine and spacious, containing in\n\nitself numerous harbours, all of them deep near the shore; it\n\nis in fact an arsenal worthy of a nation holding dominion for\n\nso long a time over so vast a sea. The harbour is surrounded\n\nby lofty mountains, from whence you may view the sea\n\nand Sardinia, and a great part of the coast on either side. Here\n\nare quarries of marble, both white and marked with green, so\n\nnumerous and large, as to furnish tablets and columns of one\n\nblock; and most of the material for the fine works, both in\n\nRome and the other cities, is furnished from hence. The\n\ntransport of the marble is easy, as the quarries lie near to the\n\nsea, and from the sea they are conveyed by the Tiber. Tyrrhenia likewise supplies most of the straightest and longest\n\nplanks for building, as they are brought direct from the\n\nmountains to the river. Between Luna and Pisa flows the\n\nMacra, a division which many writers consider the true boundary of Tyrrhenia and Liguria. Pisa was founded by the\n\nPisat of the Peloponnesus, who went under Nestor to the\n\nexpedition against Troy, but in their voyage home wandered\n\nout of their course, some to Metapontium, others to the Pisatis;\n\nthey were, however, all called Pylians. The city lies between\n\nthe two rivers Arno and sar, at their point of confluence;\n\nthe former of which, though very full, descends from Arretium\n\nnot in one body, but divided into three; the second flows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndown from the Apennines. Where they fall into one current,\n\nthe shock between them is so great as to raise the water to\n\nthat height, that people standing on either bank are not able\n\nto see each other; so that necessarily the voyage up from\n\nthe sea is difficult. This voyage is about 20 stadia. There\n\nis a tradition, that when these rivers first descended from the\n\nmountains they were impeded by the inhabitants of the district, lest falling together they should inundate the country;\n\nhowever, they promised not to inundate it, and they have kept\n\ntheir word. This city appears to have been formerly flourishing, and at the present day it still maintains its name, on\n\naccount of its fertility, its marble-quarries, and its wood for\n\nbuilding ships, which formerly they employed to preserve\n\nthemselves from danger by sea; for they were more warlike\n\nthan the Tyrrheni, and were constantly irritated by the Ligurians, troublesome neighbours, who dwelt on the coast.

Here certain\n\nof the Tyrrhenians and of those proscribed by Sulla, took\n\ntheir stand, and having organized four bands, sustained a\n\nsiege for two years, and at last secured articles of truce before surrendering the place. Poplonium is situated on a lofty\n\npromontory, which projects into the sea, and forms a cher-\n\nsonesus. It likewise sustained a siege about the same time. This\n\nlittle place is now deserted, with the exception of the temples\n\nand a few houses; the sea-port, which is situated at the root\n\nof the mountain, is better inhabited, having both a small harbour and ship-sheds. This appears to me the only one of the\n\nancient Tyrrhenian cities situated on the sea; the reason\n\nbeing that this territory affords no harbours. The founders\n\n[of the cities] therefore either avoided the sea altogether, or\n\nthrew up fortifications in order that they might not become\n\nthe ready prey of those who might sail against them.

From\n\nthis city there is an indistinct and distant view of Sardinia.\n\nCyrnus, however, is nearer, being distant from Sardinia about\n\n60 stadia. While thalia is much nearer to the continent\n\nthan either, being distant therefrom only 300 stadia, and the\n\nsame number from Cyrnus. Poplonium is the best starting-\n\nplace to any of the three mentioned islands. We ourselves observed them from the height of Poplonium, in which place\n\nwe saw certain mines which had been abandoned, we also saw\n\nthe craftsmen who work the iron brought from thalia; for\n\nthey cannot reduce it into bars in the furnaces on the island,\n\nand it is therefore transferred direct from the mines to the\n\ncontinent. There is another remarkable circumstance, that\n\nthe exhausted mines of the island in course of time are again refilled similarly to what they say takes place at the \n\nin Rhodes, the marble-quarries in Paros, and the salt-mines\n\nin India, mentioned by Clitarchus. Eratosthenes was therefore incorrect in saying that from the mainland you could\n\nneither see Cyrnus nor Sardinia; and so was Artemidorus in\n\nhis assertion, that both these places lay in the high sea at a\n\ndistance of  stadia. For whatever others might, I certainly could never have seen them at such a distance, however\n\ncarefully I had looked, particularly Cyrnus. thalia has a\n\nharbour named Argoiis, derived, as they say, from the [ship]\n\nArgo, Jason having sailed hither, seeking the abode of Circe\n\nas Medea wished to see that goddess; and that from the sweat\n\nscraped off by the Argonauts and hardened, are formed the\n\nvariegated pebbles now seen on the beach. This and similar\n\ntraditions prove what we before stated, that Homer did not\n\ninvent them all himself, but, hearing the numerous current\n\nstories, he merely transferred the scenes to other localities\n\nand exaggerated the distances: as he makes Ulysses wander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nover the ocean, so does he narrate of Jason, as he too had\n\nbeen renowned for his travels: and the same he likewise relates of Menelaus.

For the qui, the Volsci, the Hernici, the\n\naborigines around Rome, the Rutuli who possessed ancient\n\nArdea, and many other nations, some larger, some smaller,\n\nformed so many separate states around Rome, when that city\n\nwas first built. Some of these nations, who dwelt in villages,\n\nwere governed by their own laws, and subjected to no common tribe. They say that neas, with his father Anchises\n\nand his child Ascanius, arrived at Laurentum, near to Ostia\n\nand the bank of the Tiber, where he built a city about 24\n\nstadia above the sea. That Latinus, the king of the aborigines who then dwelt on the site where Rome now stands,\n\nemployed his forces to aid neas against the neighbouring\n\nRutuli who inhabited Ardea, (now from Ardea to Rome is a\n\ndistance of 160 stadia,) and having gained a victory, he built\n\nnear to the spot a city, to which he gave the name of his\n\ndaughter Lavinia. However, in a second battle, commenced\n\nby the Rutuli, Latinus fell, and neas, being conqueror, suc-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nceeded this prince on the throne, and conferred on his subjects\n\nthe name of Latini. After the death both of himself and his\n\nfather, Ascanius founded Alba, on Mount Albanus, situated\n\nabout the same distance from Rome as Ardea. Here the\n\nRomans and Latini conjointly offer sacrifice to Jupiter. The\n\nmagistracy all assemble, and during the period of the solemnity the government of the city is intrusted to some distinguished youth. The facts related of Amulius and his\n\nbrother Numitor, some of which are fictitious, while others\n\napproach nearer the truth, occurred four hundred years later.\n\nThese two brothers, who were descended from Ascanius, succeeded conjointly to the government of Alba, which extended\n\nas far as the Tiber. However, Amulius the younger, having\n\nexpelled the elder, governed [alone]. Numitor had a son and\n\na daughter; the former Amulius treacherously murdered in\n\nthe chase; the latter, that she might remain childless, he made\n\na priestess of Vesta, thus imposing virginity upon her. This\n\n[daughter] they name Rhea Silvia. Afterwards he discovered\n\nthat she was pregnant, and when she had given birth to\n\ntwins, he, out of respect to his brother, placed her in confinement, instead of putting her to death, and exposed the boys\n\nby the Tiber according to a national usage. According to\n\nthe mythology, Mars was the father of these children, and\n\nwhen they were exposed they were discovered and suckled\n\nby a she-wolf. Faustulus, one of the swine-herds of the place,\n\ntook and reared them up, and named one Romulus, the other\n\nRemus. (We must understand that Faustulus, who took them\n\nup and nourished them, was an influential man, and a subject\n\nof Amulius.) Having arrived at man's estate, they waged\n\nwar upon Amulius and his sons; and having slain them,\n\nrestored the government to Numitor. They then returned\n\nhome and founded Rome, in a locality selected rather through\n\nnecessity than choice, as the site was neither fortified by\n\nnature, nor sufficiently large for a city of importance. In\n\naddition to this, the neighbourhood supplied no inhabitants;\n\nfor those who dwelt around, even though touching the very\n\nwalls of the newly founded city, kept to themselves, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwould have nothing at all to do with the Albani.

Between the fifth and sixth\n\nmile-stone which marks the distance from Rome there is a\n\nplace named Festi; this they say was at that time the limit\n\nof the Roman territory, and at the present day, both here and\n\nin numerous other places which they consider to have been\n\nboundaries, the priests offer the sacrifice denominated Ambarvia. They say that, at the time of the foundation [of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncity], a dispute arose in which Remus lost his life. The city\n\nbeing built, Romulus assembled men from every quarter, and\n\ninstituted for an asylum a grove between the citadel and the\n\nCapitol, to which whoever fled from the neighbouring states,\n\nhe proclaimed as Roman citizens. Not having wives for these\n\nmen, he appointed a horse-race in honour of Neptune, which\n\nis celebrated to this day. Numbers [of spectators] having\n\nassembled, particularly of the Sabini, he commanded that\n\neach of those who were in want of a wife, should carry off\n\none of the assembled maidens. Titus Tatius, king of the\n\nQuirites, took up arms to avenge the insult, but made peace\n\nwith Romulus on condition that their kingdoms should be\n\nunited, and that they should divide the sovereignty between\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthem. Tatius, however, was treacherously assassinated in\n\nLavinium, upon which Romulus, with the consent of the\n\nQuirites, reigned alone.

It has a small city, together with\n\na temple to Circe and an altar to Minerva; they likewise say\n\nthat a cup is shown which belonged to Ulysses. Between\n\n[Antium and Circum] is the river Stura, which has a\n\nstation for ships: the rest of the coast is exposed to the southwest wind, with the exception of this small harbour of Circum. Above this, in the interior, is the Pomentine plain:\n\nthe region next to this was formerly inhabited by the Ausonians, who likewise possessed Campania: next after these the\n\nOsci, who also held part of Campania; now, however, as we\n\nhave remarked, the whole, as far as Sinuessa, belongs to the\n\nLatini. A peculiar fate has attended the Osci and Ausonians;\n\nfor although the Osci have ceased to exist as a distinct tribe,\n\ntheir dialect is extant among the Romans, dramatic and\n\nburlesque pieces composed in it being still represented at\n\ncertain games which were instituted in ancient times. And\n\nas for the Ausonians, although they never have dwelt by the sea\n\nof Sicily, it is named the Ausonian Sea. At 100 stadia\n\nfrom Circum is Tarracina, formerly named Trachina, on\n\naccount of its ruggedness; before it is a great marsh, formed by\n\ntwo rivers, the larger of which is called the Aufidus. This is\n\nthe first place where the Via Appia approaches the sea. This\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nroad is paved from Rome to Brundusium, and has great\n\ntraffic. Of the maritime cities, these alone are situated on\n\nit; Tarracina, beyond it Formi, Minturn, Sinuessa, and\n\ntowards its extremity Tarentum and Brundusium. Near to\n\nTarracina, advancing in the direction of Rome, a canal runs\n\nby the side of the Via Appia, which is supplied at intervals\n\nby water from the marshes and rivers. Travellers generally\n\nsail up it by night, embarking in the evening, and landing in\n\nthe morning to travel the rest of their journey by the way;\n\nhowever, during the day the passage boat is towed by mules.\n\nBeyond is Formi, founded by the Lacedmonians, and\n\nformerly called Hormi, on account of its excellent port. Between these [two cities], is a gulf which they have named\n\nCaiata, in fact all gulfs are called by the Lacedmonians\n\nCaiet: some, however, say that the gulf received this appellation from [Caieta], the nurse of neas. From Tarracina\n\nto the promontory of Caiata is a length of 100 stadia. Here\n\nare opened vast caverns, which contain large and sumptuous\n\nmansions. From hence to Formi is a distance of 40 stadia.\n\nBetween this city and Sinuessa, at a distance of about 80\n\nstadia from each, is Minturn. The river Liris, formerly\n\nnamed the Clanis, flows through it. It descends from the\n\nApennines, passes through the country of the Vescini, and\n\nby the village of Fregell, (formerly a famous city,) and so\n\ninto a sacred grove situated below the city, and held in great\n\nveneration by the people of Minturn. There are two islands,\n\nnamed Pandataria and Pontia, lying in the high sea, and\n\nclearly discernible from the caverns. Although small, they\n\nare well inhabited, are not at any great distance from each\n\nother, and at 250 stadia from the mainland.

All these places produce excellent wines;\n\nbut those of Ccubum, Fundi, and Setia are most in repute,\n\nand so are the Falernian, Alban, and Statanian wines.

It has been remarked above,\n\nthat its position was fixed, not by choice, but necessity; to\n\nthis must be added, that those who afterwards enlarged it,\n\nwere not at liberty to select a better site, being prevented by\n\nwhat was already built. The first [kings] fortified the\n\nCapitol, the Palatium, and the Collis Quirinalis, which was so\n\neasy of access, that when Titus Tatius came to avenge the\n\nrape of the [Sabine] virgins, he took it on the first assault.\n\nAncus Marcius, who added Mount Clius and the Aventine\n\nMount with the intermediate plain, separated as these places\n\nwere both from each other and from what had been formerly\n\nfortified, was compelled to do this of necessity; since he did\n\nnot consider it proper to leave outside his walls, heights so\n\nwell protected by nature, to whomsoever might have a mind\n\nto fortify themselves upon them, while at the same time he\n\nwas not capable of enclosing the whole as far as Mount Quirinus. Servius perceived this defect, and added the Esquiline\n\nand Viminal hills. As these were both of easy access from\n\nwithout, a deep trench was dug outside them and the earth\n\nthrown up on the inside, thus forming a terrace of 6 stadia\n\nin length along the inner side of the trench. This terrace he\n\nsurmounted with a wall flanked with towers, and extending\n\nfrom the Colline to the Esquiline gate. Midway along the\n\nterrace is a third gate, named after the Viminal hill. Such is\n\nthe Roman rampart, which seems to stand in need of other\n\nramparts itself. But it seems to me that the first [founders]\n\nwere of opinion, both in regard to themselves and their successors, that Romans had to depend not on fortifications, but\n\non arms and their individual valour, both for safety and\n\nfor wealth, and that walls were not a defence to men, but men\n\nwere a defence to walls. At the period of its commencement,\n\nwhen the large and fertile districts surrounding the city belonged to others, and while it lay easily open to assault, there\n\nwas nothing in its position which could be looked upon as\n\nfavourable; but when by valour and labour these districts\n\nbecame its own, there succeeded a tide of prosperity surpass-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ning the advantages of every other place. Thus, notwithstanding the prodigious increase of the city, there has been\n\nplenty of food, and also of wood and stone for ceaseless building, rendered necessary by the falling down of houses, and\n\non account of conflagrations, and of the sales, which seem never\n\nto cease. These sales are a kind of voluntary falling down of\n\nhouses, each owner knocking down and rebuilding one part or\n\nanother, according to his individual taste. For these purposes\n\nthe numerous quarries, the forests, and the rivers which convey the materials, offer wonderful facilities. Of these rivers,\n\nthe first is the Teverone, which flows from Alba, a city of\n\nthe Latins near to the country of the Marsi, and from thence\n\nthrough the plain below this [city], till it unites with the\n\nTiber. After this come the Nera and the Timia, which\n\npassing through Ombrica fall into the Tiber, and the Chiana,\n\nwhich flows through Tyrrhenia and the territory of Clusiumn.\n\nAugustus Csar endeavoured to avert from the city damages\n\nof the kind alluded to, and instituted a company of freedmen,\n\nwho should be ready to lend their assistance in cases of con-\n\nflagration; whilst, as a preventive against the falling of houses,\n\nhe decreed that all new buildings should not be carried so\n\nhigh as formerly, and that those erected along the public\n\nways should not exceed seventy feet in height.

The Grecian cities are thought to have flourished\n\nmainly on account of the felicitous choice made by their founders, in regard to the beauty and strength of their sites, their\n\nproximity to some port, and the fineness of the country. But\n\nthe Roman prudence was more particularly employed on\n\nmatters which had received but little attention from the\n\nGreeks, such as paving their roads, constructing aqueducts,\n\nand sewers, to convey the sewage of the city into the Tiber.\n\nIn fact, they have paved the roads, cut through hills, and\n\nfilled up valleys, so that the merchandise may be conveyed by\n\ncarriage from the ports. The sewers, arched over with hewn\n\nstones, are large enough in some parts for waggons loaded\n\nwith hay to pass through; while so plentiful is the supply\n\nof water from the aqueducts, that rivers may be said to flow\n\nthrough the city and the sewers, and almost every house\n\nis furnished with water-pipes and copious fountains. To\n\neffect which Marcus Agrippa directed his special attention;\n\nhe likewise bestowed upon the city numerous ornaments. We\n\nmay remark, that the ancients, occupied with greater and more\n\nnecessary concerns, paid but little attention to the beautifying of Rome. But their successors, and especially those of\n\nour own day, without neglecting these things, have at the\n\nsame time embellished the city with numerous and splendid\n\nobjects. Pompey, divus Csar, and Augustus, with his children, friends, wife, and sister, have surpassed all others in their\n\nzeal and munificence in these decorations. The greater number of these may be seen in the Campus Martius, which to the\n\nbeauties of nature adds those of art. The size of the plain is marvellous, permitting chariot-races and other feats of horsemanship without impediment, and multitudes to exercise themselves\n\nat ball, in the circus and the palstra.

For this cause the Romans, esteeming it as the most sacred place, have there erected funeral monuments to the most illustrious persons of either sex. The most\n\nremarkable of these is that designated as the Mausoleum,\n\nwhich consists of a mound of earth raised upon a high founda-\n\ntion of white marble, situated near the river, and covered to\n\nthe top with ever-green shrubs. Upon the summit is a bronze\n\nstatue of Augustus Csar, and beneath the mound are the\n\nashes of himself, his relatives, and friends. Behind is a large\n\ngrove containing charming promenades.

They inhabit the plains extending\n\nfrom the mountains to the sea; the length of their country\n\nconsiderably exceeds its breadth; the soil is every where\n\ngood, but better fitted for the cultivation of fruits than grain.\n\nIts breadth, from the mountains to the sea varies in different\n\nparts. But its length; from the river sis to Castrum,\n\nsailing round the coast, is 800 stadia. Of its cities, Ancona\n\nis of Grecian origin, having been founded by the Syracusans\n\nwho fled from the tyranny of Dionysius. It is situated upon\n\na cape, which bending round towards the north forms a harbour; and it abounds in wine and wheat. Near to it is the\n\ncity of Auxumon, at a little distance from the sea. After it\n\nare Septempeda, Pneuentia, Potentia, and Firmum Picenum, with its port of Castellum. Beyond, is the temple of\n\nCupra, built and dedicated by the Tyrrheni to Juno, who is\n\nnamed by them Cupra; and after it the river Tronto,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith a city of the same name. Beyond this is Castrum\n\nNovum, and the river Piomba, flowing from the city of\n\nAdria, and having [at its mouth] the naval station of Adria,\n\nwhich bears the same name as itself. In the interior is [the\n\ncity of Adria] itself and Asculum Picenum, a very strong\n\nposition, upon which is built a wall: the mountains which surround it are not accessible to armies. Above Picenum are\n\nthe Vestini, the Marsi, the Peligni, the Marucini, and the\n\nFrentani, a Samnitic nation possessing the hill-country, and\n\nextending almost to the sea. All these nations are small, but\n\nextremely brave, and have frequently given the Romans\n\nproofs of their valour, first as enemies, afterwards as allies;\n\nand finally, having demanded the liberty and rights of citizens,\n\nand being denied, they revolted and kindled the Marsian war.\n\nThey decreed that Corfinium, the metropolis of the Peligni,\n\nshould be the capital for all the Italians instead of Rome: made\n\nit their place d'armes, and new-named it Italica. Then, having\n\nconvoked deputies from all the people friendly to their design,\n\nthey created consuls and pretors, and maintained the war\n\nfor two years, until they had obtained the rights for which\n\nthey struggled. The war was named the Marsian war, be-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncause that nation commenced the insurrection, and particularly\n\non account of Pompdius. These nations live generally in\n\nvillages, nevertheless they are possessed of certain cities, some\n\nof which are at some little distance from the sea, as Corfinium, Sulmo, Maruvium, and Teatea the metropolis of\n\nthe Marrucini. Others are on the coast, as Aternum on the\n\nPicentine boundary, so named from the river [Aternus],\n\nwhich separates the Vestini from the Marrucini. This river\n\nflows from the territory of Amiternum and through the Vestini, leaving on its right the Marrucini, who lie above the\n\nPeligni, [at the place where the river] is crossed by a bridge.\n\nThe city, which bears the same name, (viz. Aternum,) belongs to the Vestini, but its port is used in common both by\n\nthe Peligni and the Marrucini. The bridge I have mentioned is about 24 stadia from Corfinium. After Aternum is\n\nOrton, a naval arsenal of the Frentani, and Buca, which belongs to the same people, and is conterminous with the Apulian\n\nTeanum.  Ortonium is situated in the territory of the\n\nFrentani. It is rocky, and inhabited by banditti, who construct their dwellings of the wrecks of ships, and lead other-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwise a savage life.  Between Orton and Aternum is the river\n\nSagrus, which separates the Frentani from the Peligni.

We shall in the first place speak of Campania. From Sinuessa to Misenum the coast forms a vast\n\ngulf; beyond this is another gulf still larger, which they\n\nname the Crater. It is enclosed by the two promontories of\n\nMisenum and the Athenum. It is along the shores of these\n\n[two gulfs] that the whole of Campania is situated.

These hills, now so beautifully culti-\n\nvated were formerly covered with wild forests, gigantic and\n\nimpenetrable, which overshadowed the gulf, imparting a feeling\n\nof superstitious awe. The inhabitants affirm that birds, flying\n\nover the lake, fall into the water, being stifled by the vapours\n\nrising from it, a phenomenon of all Plutonian localities. They\n\nbelieved, in fact, that this place was a Plutonium, around\n\nwhich the Kimmerians used to dwell, and those who sailed\n\ninto the place made sacrifice and propitiatory offerings to the\n\ninfernal deities, as they were instructed by the priests who\n\nministered at the place. There is here a spring of water near\n\nto the sea fit for drinking, from which, however, every one\n\nabstained, as they supposed it to be water from the Styx:\n\n[they thought likewise] that the oracle of the dead was\n\nsituated some where here; and the hot springs near to the\n\nAcherusian Lake indicated the proximity of Pyriphlegethon.\n\nEphorus, peopling this place with Kimmerii, tells us that they\n\ndwell in under-ground habitations, named by them Argill, and\n\nthat these communicate with one another by means of certain\n\nsubterranean passages; and that they conduct strangers\n\nthrough them to the oracle, which is built far below the surface of the earth. They live on the mines together with the profits accruing from the oracle, and grants made to them by the\n\nking [of the country]. It was a traditional custom for the servants of the oracle never to behold the sun, and only to quit their\n\ncaverns at night. It was on this account that the poet said,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt last, however, these men were exterminated by one of the\n\nkings, the oracle having deceived him; but [adds Ephorus]\n\nthe oracle is still in existence, though removed to another\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplace. Such were the myths related by our ancestors. But\n\nnow that the wood surrounding the Avernus has been cut\n\ndown by Agrippa, the lands built upon, and a subterranean\n\npassage cut from Avernus to Cum, all these appear fables.\n\nPerhaps Cocceius, who made this subterranean passage,\n\nwished to follow the practice of the Kimmerians we have\n\nalready described, or fancied that it was natural to this place\n\nthat its roads should be made under-ground."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "lime/nas nauloxwta/tous a)pe/deicen."}, "#text": "Dion Cassius tells us, on the contrary, that owing to the exertions of\n\nAgrippa, the gulfs both of Avernus and Lucrinus became excellent ports,"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Pozzuoli."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "La Solfa-terra."}], "pb": {"@n": "365"}, "milestone": {"@ed": "P", "@n": "7", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "The Lucrine gulf extends in breadth as far as Ba; it\n\nis separated from the sea by a bank eight stadia in length,\n\nand the breadth of a carriage-way; this they say was constructed by Hercules when he drove away the oxen of Geryon.\n\nBut as the wave covered its surface in stormy weather, rendering it difficult to pass on foot, Agrippa has repaired it.\n\nSmall vessels can put into it, but it is useless as a harbour.\n\nIt contains abundant oyster-beds.

They were victorious,\n\nand accordingly of the productions, the one kind were sacrificed, the other consecrated. However, in a time of scarcity,\n\nsome one remarked, that they ought likewise to have\n\nconsecrated the children. This then they did, and the children born at that period were called the sons of Mars. When\n\nthese had grown up to manhood, they were sent forth, a bull\n\nleading the way, to found a colony. The bull lay down to\n\nrest in a place belonging to the Opici; a people dwelling in\n\nvillages. These they drove out, and established themselves\n\nin the place. The bull, according to the direction of the diviners, they sacrificed to Mars, who had given him to then\n\nas a leader. It seems to have been in allusion to this that\n\ntheir parents called them by the diminutive form of Sabelli.\n\nThe name of Samnites, or, as the Greeks call them, Saunites,\n\noriginated in another cause. It is also said that certain Lacedmonians came to dwell amongst them, and that this is the\n\nreason of their affection for the Greeks, and that certain of\n\nthem are called Pitanat. The whole of this, however,\n\nappears to be a mere fabrication of the Tarentini, interested\n\nin flattering and conciliating to themselves a neighbouring\n\npeople, so powerful as to be able, on a time, to bring into the\n\nfield a force of eighty thousand foot-soldiers, and eight thousand cavalry. There is said to be a law amongst the Samnites, excellent in itself, and calculated to excite to virtue.\n\nIt is not lawful for fathers to give away their daughters to\n\nwhomsoever they may please; but every year ten of the most\n\nvirtuous young women, and ten of the most virtuous young\n\nmen, are selected; of these the most excellent young man\n\nis married to the most excellent young woman, the second\n\nto the second, and so on in order. Should he who re-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nceives this reward, afterwards change and become wicked, he\n\nis dishonoured, and the wife who had been given is taken away\n\nfrom him.

It was founded by the Ausonians; afterwards the tolians, under the command of Thoas,\n\ngained possession of it. These were expelled by the Bruttii;\n\nHannibal and the Romans have overthrown the Bruttii. In\n\nthe vicinity of Temesa is the Heroum of Polites, one of the\n\ncompanions of Ulysses. It is surrounded by a thick grove of\n\nwild olives. He was treacherously slain by the barbarians,\n\nand became in consequence very wrathful, and his shade so\n\ntormented the inhabitants that they submitted to pay him a\n\ntribute, according to the direction of a certain oracle. Thus\n\nit became a proverb amongst them,  for they said that [for a long time he] had\n\ntormented them. But when the Epizephyrian Locrians took\n\nthe city, they feign that Euthymus the pugilist went out against\n\nhim, and having overcome him in fight, constrained him to\n\nfree the inhabitants from tribute. They say that the poet\n\nintended this Temesa, and not the Tamassus in Cyprus, (for\n\nit is said that the words are suitable to either,) when he sings,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand certain copper-mines are pointed out near to the place,\n\nwhich are now exhausted. Contiguous to it is Terina, which\n\nHannibal destroyed, when he found he could no longer retain\n\nit; at the time when he took refuge in the country of the\n\nBruttii. Next in order comes Cosentia, the metropolis of the\n\nBruttii. A little above it is Pandosia, which is strongly fortified, before which Alexander the Molossian king was overthrown. This prince was led astray by the oracle of Dodona,\n\nwhich commanded him to avoid Acheron and Pandosia; for\n\nplaces with names like these being pointed out in Thesprotia,\n\ncaused him to lose his life here. The position has three\n\nsummits, and the river Acheron flows by it. He was also\n\nmistaken in another oracle,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor he thought that it foreshowed the destruction of his enemies, and not of his own people. They say that Pandosia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwas formerly the residence of the notrian kings. After\n\nCosentia is Hipponium, founded by the Locrians. The Romans took it from the Bruttii, who were in possession of it at\n\na subsequent period, and changed the name into Vibo-Valentia. And because the meadows in its vicinity are luxuriant\n\nand full of flowers, it is supposed that Proserpine came over\n\nfrom Sicily to gather them, and from thence the custom among\n\nwomen of this city, to gather flowers and plait garlands, prevailed to such an extent, that they now think it shameful to\n\nwear purchased garlands at the festivals. It also possesses\n\na harbour made by Agathocles, the tyrant of Sicily, when\n\nhe was in possession of the town. On sailing hence to the\n\nPortus Herculis, we come to the point where the headlands\n\nof Italy, as they stretch towards the Strait [of Sicily], begin\n\nto turn westward. In this voyage we pass Medma, a city of\n\nthe same Locrians, which bears the name of a copious fountain, and possessing at a short distance a naval station, called\n\nEmporium. Very nigh is the river Metauro, as also a naval station bearing the same name. The Lipari Isles lie off this\n\ncoast; they are distant 200 stadia from the strait. They say\n\nthat they are the islands of olus, of whom the poet makes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmention in the Odyssey. They are seven in number, and\n\nare all easily distinguished both from Sicily and the coast of\n\nthe continent about Medma. We will speak of them in particular when we describe Sicily. After the river Metaurus,\n\nthere is another Metaurus. Next in order is Scyllum, an\n\nelevated cliff nearly surrounded by the sea. But connected\n\nwith the main-land by a low isthmus easily accessible on either\n\nside, which Anaxilaus, the tyrant of Rhegium, fortified against\n\nthe Tyrrheni, and formed a commodious haven, and thus prevented the pirates from passing through the strait. Next to\n\nthe Scyllan promontory was that of Cnys, distant from\n\nMedma 250 stadia. It is the last headland, and forms the\n\nnarrowest part of the Strait [of Sicily], being opposite to Cape\n\nPelorus on the Sicilian side, which is one of the three points\n\nwhich give to that island the form of a triangle. Its aspect\n\nis towards the rising of the sun in summer, whilst that of\n\nCnys looks towards the west. Indeed they both seem to\n\nhave diverged from the general line of coast in order to stand\n\nout opposite each other. From Cnys to the Posidonium\n\n [and] the Columna Rheginorum, the narrow part of the\n\nstrait stretches as much as 6 stadia, the shortest passage\n\nacross the strait is a little more. From the Columna [Rhegi-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnorum] to Rhegium, where the strait begins to widen, is a\n\nhundred [stadia] as you advance in a direction towards the\n\nexterior and eastern sea, which is called the sea of Sicily."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Now Reggio, one of the most celebrated and flourishing cities of\n\nMagna Grecia, founded about 696 years B.

It has\n\nalways been a bulwark for us against the island [of Sicily],\n\nand, indeed, has recently served to that purpose when Sextus\n\nPompeins alienated Sicily.

But now these mouths\n\nbeing opened, through which the fire is drawn up, and the\n\nardent masses and water poured out, they say that the land in\n\nthe neighbourhood of the Strait of Sicily rarely suffers from\n\nthe effects of earthquakes; but formerly all the passages to the\n\nsurface being blocked up, the fire which was smouldering beneath the earth, together with the vapour, occasioned terrible\n\nearthquakes, and the regions, being disturbed by the force of\n\nthe pent-up winds, sometimes gave way, and being rent received the sea, which flowed in from either side; and thus\n\nwere formed both this strait and the sea which surrounds the\n\nother islands in the neighbourhood. For Prochyta and the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPithecuss as well as Capre, Leucosia, the Sirenes, and\n\nthe notrides, are but so many detached fragments from the\n\ncontinent, but other islands have risen from the bottom of the\n\nsea, a circumstance which frequently occurs in many places;\n\nfor it is more reasonable to think that the islands in the midst\n\nof the sea have been raised up from the bottom, and that those\n\nwhich lie off headlands and are separated merely by a strait\n\nwere broken off from them.

But Dionysius (the elder),\n\nhaving been treated with contempt by them, destroyed the\n\nillustrious city which had founded many towns and produced\n\nmany distinguished characters, whether statesmen or men of\n\nletters, for when he sought a consort from their city, they\n\noffered him the hangman's daughter; but his son (Dionysius\n\nthe younger) partly restored it, and called it Phbia. During the war with Pyrrhus, a body of Campanians destroyed\n\nmost of the citizens against the faith of treaties, and a little\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbefore the Marsic or social war, earthquakes destroyed most\n\nof the towns; but after Augustus Csar had driven Sextus\n\nPompeius out of Sicily, when he saw that the city was deficient of inhabitants, he appointed certain of those who\n\naccompanied the expedition to reside there, and it is now\n\ntolerably well peopled."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Pliny computes the distance from Rhegium to Cape Leucopetra at 12\n\nmiles; there is probably some error in the text, as there is no cape which\n\ncorresponds with the distance of 50 stadia from Rhegium.

Of the two cities, viz. Metapontium which was situated\n\nthe nearer, [and Siris the further,] from Tarentum, the new\n\ncomers preferred to occupy Metapontium.

Of the sides which these three\n\nheadlands bound, two are somewhat concave, while the third\n\nis slightly convex, it runs from Lilybum to Pelorias, and is\n\nthe longest, being, as Posidonius has said,  stadia adding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfurther twenty. Of the others, that extending to Pachynus\n\nfrom Lilybum is the longer, while the shortest faces the\n\nStrait and Italy, extending from Pelorias to Pachynus, being\n\nabout  or  stadia. Posidonius shows that the circumference is 4400 stadia, but in the Chorography the distances are declared to exceed the above numbers, being\n\nseverally reckoned in miles. Thus from Cape Pelorias to\n\nMyl, 25 miles; from Myl to Tyndaris, 25; thence to\n\nAgathyrnum, 30; from Agathyrnum to Alsa, 30; from\n\nAlsa to Cephaldium, 30; these are but insignificant\n\nplaces; from Cephaldium to the river Himera, which runs\n\nthrough the midst of Sicily, 18; from thence to Panormus,\n\n35; [thence] to the Emporium of the gestani, 32; leaving to Lilybum a distance of 38; thence having doubled\n\nthe Cape and coasting the adjacent side to Heracleum, 75;\n\nand to the Emporium of the Agrigentini, 20; and to Cama-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrina, another 20; then to Pachynus, 50; thence again along\n\nthe third side to Syracuse, 36; from Syracuse to Catana, 60;\n\nthen to Tauromenium, 33; thence to Messana, 30. Thus on\n\nfoot from Pachynus to Pelorias we have 168 [miles], and\n\nfrom Messana to [Cape] Lilybeum, on the Via Valeria, we\n\nhave 235 [miles]. Some have estimated the circuit in a\n\nmore simple way, as Ephorus, who says that the compass of\n\nthe island by sea takes five days and nights. Posidonius attempts to determine the situation of the island by climata,\n\nand places Pelorias to the north, Lilybum to the south, and\n\nPachynus to the east. We however consider that of necessity\n\nall climata are set out in the manner of a parallelogram, but\n\nthat districts portrayed as triangles, and especially such triangles as are scalene, and whereof no one side lies parallel\n\nto a side of the parallelogram, cannot in any way be assimilated to climata on account of their obliquity. However, we\n\nmust allow, that in treating of Sicily, Pelorias, which lies to\n\nthe south of Italy, may well be called the most northern of\n\nthe three angles, so that we say that the line which joins it\n\nto Pachynus faces the east but looks towards the north. Now\n\nthis line [of coast] will make the side next the Strait [of Messina], and it must have a slight inclination towards the winter\n\nsunrise; for thus the shore slightly changes its direction as\n\nyou travel from Catana towards Syracuse and Pachynus.\n\nNow the transit from Pachynus to the mouth of the Alpheus\n\nis 4000 stadia. But when Artemidorus says that from Pachy-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnus to Tnarum it is 4600, and from the Alpheus to the\n\nPamisus is  stadia, he appears to me to lie open to the\n\nobjection of having given distances which do not accord\n\nwith the 4000 stadia from Pachynus to the Alpheus. The\n\nline run from Pachynus to Lilybum (which is much to the\n\nwest of Pelorias) is considerably diverged from the south towards the west, having at the same time an aspect looking\n\ntowards the east and towards the south. On one side it is\n\nwashed by the sea of Sicily, and on the other by the Libyan\n\nSea, extending from Carthage to the Syrtes. The shortest\n\nrun is  stadia from Lilybum to the coast of Africa\n\nabout Carthage; and, according to report, a certain very\n\nsharp-sighted person, placed on a watch-tower, announced\n\nto the Carthaginians besieged in Lilybum the number of\n\nthe ships which were leaving Carthage. And from Lilybum to Pelorias the side must necessarily incline towards\n\nthe east, and look in a direction towards the west and north,\n\nhaving Italy to the north, and the Tyrrhenian Sea with the\n\nislands of olus to the west."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Taormina."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "date": {"@value": "-734", "#text": "734"}, "#text": "Naxos was not situated between Catana and Syracuse, but was most\n\nprobably built on the left bank of the Fiume Freddo, the ancient Asines,\n\nnear Taormina.

They\n\nsay that Myscellus and Archias having repaired to Delphi\n\nat the same time to consult the oracle, the god demanded\n\nwhether they would choose wealth or health, when Archias\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npreferred wealth and Myscellus health, upon which the oracle\n\nassigned Syracuse to the former to found, and Crotona to the\n\nlatter. And certainly, in like manner as it fell out that the\n\nCrotoniat should inhabit a state so notable for salubrity as\n\nwe have described, so such great riches have accrued to the\n\nSyracusans that their name has been embodied in the proverb\n\napplied to those who have too great wealth, viz. that they\n\nhave not yet attained to a tithe of the riches of the Syracusans. While Archias was on his voyage to Sicily, he left\n\nChersicrates, a chief of the race of the Heracleid, with a\n\npart of the expedition to settle the island now called Corcyra,\n\nbut anciently called Scheria, and he, having expelled the Liburni who possessed it, established his colony in the island.\n\nArchias, pursuing his route, met with certain Dorians at\n\nZephyrium, come from Sicily, and who had quitted the company of those who had founded Megara; these he took with\n\nhim, and in conjunction with them founded Syracuse. The city\n\nflourished on account of the fertility of the country and the\n\nconvenience of the harbours, the citizens became great rulers;\n\nwhile under tyrants themselves, they domineered over the\n\nother states [of Sicily], and when freed from despotism, they\n\nset at liberty such as had been enslaved by the barbarians:\n\nof these barbarians some were the aboriginal inhabitants of\n\nthe island, while others had come across from the continent.\n\nThe Greeks suffered none of the barbarians to approach the\n\nshore, although they were not able to expel them entirely\n\nfrom the interior, for the Siculi, Sicani, Morgetes, and some\n\nothers, still inhabit the island to the present day, amongst\n\nwhom also were the Iberians, who, as Ephorus relates, were\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe first of the barbarians that are considered to have been\n\nsettlers in Sicily. It seems probable that Morgantium was\n\nfounded by the Morgetes. Formerly it was a city, but now\n\nit is not. When the Carthaginians endeavoured to gain\n\npossession of the island they continually harassed both the\n\nGreeks and the barbarians, but the Syracusans withstood\n\nthem; at a later period the Romans expelled the Carthaginians and took Syracuse after a long siege. And [Sextus]\n\nPompeius, having destroyed Syracuse in the same way as he\n\nhad done by the other cities, Augustus Csar in our own\n\ntimes sent thither a colony, and to a great extent restored it\n\nto its former importance, for anciently it consisted of five\n\ntowns enclosed by a wall of 180 stadia, but there being no\n\ngreat need that it should fill this extensive circle, he thought\n\nit expedient to fortify in a better way the thickly inhabited\n\nportion lying next the island of Ortygia, the circumference of\n\nwhich by itself equals that of an important city. Ortygia is\n\nconnected to the mainland by a bridge, and [boasts of] the\n\nfountain Arethusa, which springs in such abundance as to\n\nform a river at once, and flows into the sea. They say that\n\nit is the river Alpheus which rises in the Peloponnesus, and\n\nthat it flows through the land beneath the sea to the place\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the Arethusa rises and flows into the sea. Some such\n\nproofs as these are given in .upport of the fact. A certain\n\nchalice having fallen into the river at Olympia was cast up\n\nby the springs of Arethusa; the fountain too is troubled by\n\nthe sacrifices of oxen at Olympia. And Pindar, following\n\nsuch reports, thus sings,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimus the historian advances these accounts in like manner with Pindar. Undoubtedly if before reaching the sea\n\nthe Alpheus were to fall into some chasm, there would be a\n\nprobability that it continued its course from thence to Sicily,\n\npreserving its potable water unmixed with the sea; but since\n\nthe mouth of the river manifestly falls into the sea, and there\n\ndoes not appear any opening in the bed of the sea there, which\n\nwould be capable of imbibing the waters of the river, (although\n\neven if there were they could not remain perfectly fresh, still\n\nit might be possible to retain much of the character of fresh\n\nwater, if they were presently to be swallowed down into a\n\npassage running below the earth which forms the bed of the\n\nsea,) it is altogether impossible; and this the water of Arethusa clearly proves, being perfectly fit for beverage; but\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat the flow of the river should remain compact through so\n\nlong a course, not mixing with the sea until it should fall\n\ninto the fancied channel, is entirely visionary; for we can\n\nscarcely credit it of the Rhone, the body of the waters of which\n\nremains compact during its passage through the lake, and\n\npreserves a visible course, but in that instance both the distance is short and the lake is not agitated by waves like the\n\nsea, but in this case of the Alpheus, where there are great\n\nstorms and the waters are tossed with violence, the supposition is by no means worthy of attention. The fable of the\n\nchalice being carried over is likewise a mere fabrication, for\n\nit is not calculated for transfer, nor is it by any means probable it should be washed away so far, nor yet by such diffi-\n\ncult passages. Many rivers, however, and in many parts of\n\nthe world, flow beneath the earth, but none for so great a\n\ndistance.Still, although there may be no impossibility in\n\nthis circumstance, yet the above-mentioned accounts are altogether impossible, and almost as absurd as the fable related\n\nof the Inachus: this river, as Sophocles feigns,\n\n\n\n\n\nand further on [he says],\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose who would have the river Inopus to be a branch of\n\nthe Nile flowing to Delos, exaggerate this kind of marvel to\n\nthe utmost. Zolus the rhetorician, in his Eulogium of the\n\npeople of Tenedos, says that the river Alpheus flows from\n\nTenedos: yet this is the man who blames Homer for fabulous\n\nwriting. Ibycus also says that the Asopus, a river of Sicyon,\n\nflows from Phrygia. Hecatus is more rational, who says\n\nthat the Inachus of the Amphilochi, which flows from Mount\n\nLacmus, from whence also the as descends, was distinct\n\nfrom the river of like name in Argolis, and was so named after\n\nAmphilochus, from whom likewise the city of Argos was de-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnominated Amphilochian. He says further, that this river\n\nfalls into the Achelous, and that the as flows to Apollonia\n\ntowards the west. On each side of the island there is an\n\nextensive harbour; the extent of the larger one is 80 stadia.\n\n[Augustus] Csar has not only restored this city, but Catana,\n\nand likewise Centoripa, which had contributed much towards\n\nthe overthrow of [Sextus] Pompey.

They were, however, of opinion,\n\nfrom the observations they were able to make, that much exaggeration pervades the accounts we have of the volcano, and\n\nespecially the tale about Empedocles, that he leaped into the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncrater, and left as a vestige of his folly one of the brazen\n\nsandals which he wore, it being found outside at a short distance from the lip of the crater, with the appearance of having\n\nbeen cast up by the violence of the flame; for neither is the\n\nplace approachable nor even visible, nor yet was it likely that\n\nany thing could be cast in thither, on account of the contrary\n\ncurrent of the vapours and other matters cast up from the\n\nlower parts of the mountain, and also on account of the overpowering excess of heat, which would most likely meet any\n\none long before approaching the mouth of the crater; and if\n\neventually any thing should be cast down, it would be totally\n\ndecomposed before it were cast up again, what manner of\n\nform so ever it might have had at first. And again, although\n\nit is not unreasonable to suppose that the force of the vapour\n\nand fire is occasionally slackened for want of a continual supply\n\nof fuel, still we are not to conclude that it is ever possible for\n\na man to approach it in the presence of so great an opposing\n\npower. tna more especially commands the shore along the\n\nStrait and Catana, but it also overlooks the sea that washes\n\nTyrrhenia and the Lipari Islands.

For the two cities,\n\nCanusium and Argyrippa, are situated at no great distance from\n\nthe sea, and in the midst of a plain; at one time they were\n\nthe most important cities of the Greeks of Italy, as is manifest\n\nfrom the circumference of their walls, but now they have\n\nfallen off. One of them was originally called Argos Hippium,\n\nthen Argyrippa, and then again Arpi. They are said to have\n\nbeen both founded by Diomed, and both the plain of Diomed\n\nand many other things are shown in these districts as evidence\n\nof his having possessed them. Such were the ancient offerings\n\nin the temple of Minerva, at Luceria. That was an ancient\n\ncity of the Daunii, but now it is of no account. Again, in\n\nthe neighbouring sea there are two islands called the Diomedean islands, one of which is inhabited, but the other, they\n\nsay, is desert: in the latter it is fabled that Diomed disappeared from the earth, and that his companions were transformed into birds, and indeed the fable goes so far as to prolong their race to the present time, saying that they are tame,\n\nand lead a sort of human life, both in respect of food, and\n\ntheir readiness to approach men of gentle manners, and to\n\nshun the evil and wanton. We have already noticed what\n\nis currently reported amongst the Heneti concerning this hero\n\n[Diomed] and the honours decreed to him by custom. It is\n\nthought also that Sipus was a settlement founded by Diomed,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nit is distant from Salapia about 140 stadia, and was called by\n\nthe Greeks Sepius, from the numbers of cuttle fish thrown\n\nup by the sea along its shore. Between Salapia and Sipus is\n\na navigable river, and a considerable estuary; by both of\n\nthese channels the merchandise, and wheat especially, of\n\nSipus is conveyed to the sea. Two heroa or shrines are shown\n\non a hill of Daunia, called Drium, one on the very brow of\n\nthe hill sacred to Calchas, those who are about to inquire of\n\nthe oracle offer a black ram to him, and sleep upon the fleece,\n\nthe other below near the foot of the hill is dedicated to Podalirius, it is about a hundred stadia distant from the sea; from\n\nthis hill also flows a stream, which is a potent cure for all\n\nmanner of diseases among cattle. The promontory of Garganum running into the sea, juts out from this bay about 300\n\nstadia. As you turn the point you perceive the town of\n\nUrium, while off the headland are seen the Diomedean islands.\n\nAll this coast produces everything in great abundance, it is\n\nexceedingly well adapted for horses and sheep, and the wool\n\nis finer than that of Tarentum, but less glossy. The district\n\nis mild on account of the cup-like situation of the plains.\n\nThere are some who report that Diomed attempted to cut a\n\ncanal to the sea, but being sent for to return home, where he\n\ndied, left it incomplete, as well as other undertakings. This\n\nis one account of him: another makes him abide here till the\n\nend of his days; a third is the fable I have already noticed,\n\nthat he vanished in the island [of Teutria], and one might\n\nreckon as a fourth that of the Heneti, for they somehow\n\nmake out that he finished his career among them, as they\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nassert his apotheosis.

A second is, that there are but few\n\nharbours, and those few capacious and admirably situated.\n\nThese are of great service both for enterprises against foreign\n\nplaces, and also in case of invasions undertaken against the\n\ncountry, and the reception of abundant merchandise.

Having thus, by degrees, arrived at a state of considerable\n\nimportance, it chanced that they lost their city suddenly,\n\ncontrary to the expectation of all men, and again recovered\n\nthe same contrary to all expectation. This took place, according to Polybius, in the nineteenth year after the naval\n\nengagement of gos-potami, about the time of the con-\n\nclusion of the peace of Antalcidas. Having escaped these\n\nmisfortunes, the Romans first reduced all the Latins to complete obedience, they then subdued the Tyrrheni, and stayed\n\nthe Kelts, who border the Po, from their too frequent and\n\nlicentious forays; then the Samnites, and after them they\n\nconquered the Tarentines and Pyrrhus, and presently after\n\nthe remainder of what is now considered as Italy, with the\n\nexception of the districts on the Po. While these still remained a subject of dispute they passed over into Sicily, and\n\nhaving wrested that island from the Carthaginians they re-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nturned to complete the conquest of the people dwelling along\n\nthe Po. While this war was still in hand Hannibal entered\n\nItaly, thus the second war against the Carthaginians ensued,\n\nand after a very short interval the third, in which Carthage\n\nwas demolished. At the same time the Romans became\n\nmasters of Africa, and of such portions of Spain as they won\n\nfrom the Carthaginians. Both the Greeks and the Macedonians, and the nations of Asia who dwelt on the hither side\n\nof the river Kisil-Irmak and the Taurus, took part in these\n\nstruggles with the Carthaginians: over these Antiochus was\n\nking, and Philip and Perseus, these therefore the Romans\n\nfound themselves obliged to subdue. The people likewise of\n\nIllyria and Thrace, who were next neighbours to the Greeks\n\nand Macedonians, at this time commenced the war with the\n\nRomans that never ceased, until the subjugation of all the\n\npeople who inhabit the countries on the hither side of the\n\nDanube and the Kisil-Irmak had been effected. The\n\nIberians, and Kelts, and all the rest who are subject to the\n\nRomans, shared a similar fate, for the Romans never rested in\n\nthe subjugation of the land to their sway until they had entirely overthrown it: in the first instance they took Numantia,\n\nand subdued Viriathus, and afterwards vanquished Sertorius,\n\nand last of all the Cantabrians, who were brought to subjection by Augustus Csar. Likewise the whole of Gaul both\n\nwithin and beyond the Alps with Liguria were annexed at first\n\nby a partial occupation, but subsequently divus Csar and\n\nthen Augustus subdued them completely in open war, so that\n\nnow the Romans direct their expeditions against the Germans from these countries as the most convenient rendezvous,\n\nand have already adorned their own country with several\n\ntriumphs over them. Also in Africa all that did not belong\n\nto the Carthaginians has been left to the charge of kings\n\nowning dependence on the Roman state, while such as have\n\nattempted to assert their independence have been overpowered.\n\nAt the present moment both Maurusia and much of the rest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof Africa have fallen to the portion of Juba on account of\n\nhis good will and friendship towards the Romans. The like\n\nthings have taken place in Asia. At first it was governed by\n\nkings who were dependent on the Romans, and afterwards\n\nwhen their several lines of succession failed, as of that of the\n\nkings Attalus, the kings of the Syrians, the Paphlagonians,\n\nCappadocians, and Egyptians, [or] when they revolted and\n\nwere subsequently deposed, as it happened in the case of\n\nMithridates Eupator, and Cleopatra of Egypt, the whole of\n\ntheir territories within the Phasis and the Euphrates, with the exception of some tribes of Arabs, were brought completely under the dominion of the Romans and the dynasties\n\nset up by them. The Armenians and the people who lie beyond Colchis, both the Albani and Iberians, require nothing\n\nmore than that Roman governors should be sent among them,\n\nand they would be easily ruled; their attempted insurrections\n\nare merely the consequence of the want of attention from the\n\nRomans, who are so much occupied elsewhere: the like may be\n\nasserted of those who dwell beyond the Danube, and inhabit\n\nthe banks of the Euxine, excepting only those who dwell on the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBosphorus and the Nomades; of these the former are in subjection to the Romans, and the latter are unprofitable for commerce on account of their wandering life, and only require to be\n\nwatched. The rest of the countries [of Asia] are chiefly inhabited by Scenites and Nomades who dwell at a great distance. The Parthians indeed border on them and are very\n\npowerful, but they have yielded so far to the superiority of\n\nthe Romans and our emperors, that they have not only sent\n\nback to Rome the trophies which they had at a still more\n\ndistant period taken from the Romans, but Phraates has even\n\nsent his sons and his sons' sons to Augustus Csar, as\n\nhostages, assiduously courting his friendship: indeed the\n\n[Parthians] of the present time frequently send for a king\n\nfrom hence, and are almost on the point of relinquishing all\n\npower to the Romans. We now see Italy, which has frequently\n\nbeen torn by civil war even since it came under the dominion of\n\nthe Romans, nay, even Rome herself, restrained from rushing\n\nheadlong into confusion and destruction by the excellence of\n\nher form of government and the ability of her emperors.\n\nIndeed it were hard to administer the affairs of so great an\n\nempire otherwise than by committing them to one man as a\n\nfather. For it would never have been in the power of the\n\nRomans and their allies to attain to a state of such perfect\n\npeace, and the enjoyment of such abundant prosperity, as\n\nAugustus Csar afforded them from the time that he took\n\nupon himself the absolute authority; and which his son Tiberius, who has succeeded him, still maintains, who takes his\n\nfather for a pattern in his government and ordinances. And\n\nin their turn his sons, Germanicus and Drusus, who are exercising the functions of government under their father, take\n\nhim for their model."}]}]}, {"@type": "book", "@n": "7", "head": ["BOOK VII.", "GERMANY.THE CIMBRI, GET, DACI.MOUTHS OF THE DANUBE.THE\n\nTAURICA CHERSONESUS, ILLYRICUM, HUNGARY, EPIRUS, DODONA, MACE-\n\nDONIA, THRACE.THE HELLESPONT."], "argument": {"p": ["SUMMARY.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The ancient Tanais."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Palus Motis."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The ancient Ister."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The ancient Propontis."}], "#text": "In the Seventh Book Strabo describes the remaining portions of Europe.\n\nThat on the east is the country beyond the Rhine, as far as the Don and the mouth of the Sea of Azof; and on the south, that which the\n\nDanube bounds, lying between the Adriatic and the left shores of the Euxine, as far as Greece and the Sea of Marmora, including the whole of Macedonia."}]}, "div2": [{"@type": "chapter", "@n": "1", "head": "CHAPTER I.", "milestone": {"@ed": "P", "@n": "1", "@unit": "section"}, "p": [{"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "date": {"@value": "1200", "#text": "1200"}, "#text": "Strabo, in a subsequent passage, states that the distance from the\n\nDanube to the city Trieste, at the head of the Adriatic, is about \n\nstadia."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The ancient Tyras."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The Borysthenes."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The Bastarn were a people occupying portions of the modern Moldavia, Podolia, and the Ukraine."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The Tyreget, or the Get of the river Tyras, were a people dwelling on the Dniester, to the south of the Bastarn."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The ancient geographers supposed that the Northern Ocean extended\n\nto the 56 of north latitude.

For he praises the opinions of Eratosthenes, who says that Homer and the rest of the ancients\n\nwere well versed in every thing that related to Greece, but\n\nwere in a state of considerable ignorance as to places at a\n\ndistance, in consequence of the impossibility of' their making\n\nlong journeys by land or voyages by sea. In support of this\n\nhe asserts, that Homer designated Aulis as 'rocky,' as indeed it is; Eteonus as 'mountainous and woody,' Thisbe as\n\n'abounding in doves,' Haliartus as ' grassy;' but that neither\n\nHomer nor the others were familiar with localities far off; for\n\nalthough there are forty rivers which discharge themselves\n\ninto the Black Sea, he makes no mention whatever even of\n\nthe most considerable, as the Danube, the Don, the Dnieper, the Bog, the Phasz, the Termeh, the Kisil-Irmak, nor does\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhe even allude to the Scythians, but makes up fables about\n\ncertain illustrious Hippemolgi, Galactophagi, and Abii. He\n\nhad become acquainted with the Paphlagonians of the interior\n\nfrom the relations of such as had penetrated into those regions\n\non foot, but he was perfectly unacquainted with the sea-coasts\n\nof the country; which indeed was likely enough, for that sea\n\nwas in his time closed to navigation, and known by the name\n\nof Pontus Axenus [or the Inhospitable] on account of the severity of the storms to which it was subject, as well as of the\n\nsavage disposition of the nations who inhabited its shores, but\n\nmore especially of the Scythian hordes, who made a practice\n\nof sacrificing strangers, devouring their flesh, and using their\n\nskulls for drinking-cups; although at a subsequent period,\n\nwhen the Ionians had established cities along its shores, it\n\nwas called by the name of Pontus Euxinus [or the Hospitable]. He was likewise in ignorance as to the natural peculiarities of Egypt and Libya, as the risings of the Nile, and\n\nthe alluvial deposits, which he no where notices, nor yet the\n\nisthmus [of Suez] which separates the Red Sea from the\n\nEgyptian Sea; nor yet does he relate any particulars of\n\nArabia, Ethiopia, or the Ocean, unless we should agree with\n\nthe philosopher Zeno in altering the Homeric line as follows,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed we ought not to be surprised at meeting with this in\n\nHomer, for those who have lived at a more recent period than\n\nhe did, have been ignorant of many things, and have told\n\nstrange tales. Hesiod has talked of \n\n and  Alcman of\n\nschylus of  and  (they say it is in his Prometheus,) and ten thousand other absurdities. From these he proceeds to censure the writers who talk of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Riphan Mountains and Mount Ogyium, and the dwelling of the Gorgons and the Hesperides, the land of Meropis mentioned by Theopompus, Cimmeris, a city mentioned\n\nin Hecatus, the land of Pancha mentioned by Euhemerus,\n\nand the river-stones formed of sand mentioned by Aristotle,\n\nwhich were dissolved by rain-showers. Further, that there\n\nexists in Africa a city of Bacchus which no one can find\n\ntwice. He likewise reproves those who assert that the wanderings of Ulysses mentioned in Homer were in the neighbourhood of Sicily, for again, if we should say that the wanderings did take place in those parts, we should have to\n\nconfess that the poet transferred them to the ocean for the\n\nsake of making his account the more romantic. Some allowance might be made for others, but no manner of excuse can\n\nbe put forward for Callimachus, who pretends to the character\n\nof a critic, and yet supposes that Gaudus was the island of\n\nCalypso, and identifies Scheria with Corcyra. Other writers\n\nhe blames for misstatements as to Gerena, Acacesium, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Demus in Ithaca, Pelethronium in Pelium, and the\n\nGlaucopium at Athens. With these and a few similar trifling\n\nobservations, most of which he has drawn from Eratosthenes,\n\nwhose inaccuracy we have before shown, he breaks off. However, we frankly acknowledge, both with respect to him\n\n[Apollodorus] and Eratosthenes, that the moderns are better\n\ninformed on geography than the ancients: but to strain the\n\nsubject beyond measure, as they do, especially when they inculpate Homer, seems to me as if it gave a fair occasion to\n\nany one to find fault, and to say by way of recrimination, that\n\nthey reproach the poet for the very things of which they\n\nthemselves are ignorant.

Thus\n\nthey say that it was through ignorance Homer and the ancients omitted to speak of the Scythians, and their cruelty to\n\nstrangers, whom they sacrificed, devoured their flesh, and afterwards made use of their skulls as drinking-cups, for which\n\nbarbarities the sea was termed the Axine, or inhospitable;\n\nbut in place of these they imagined fables as to illustrious\n\nHippemolgi, Galactophagi, and Abii, the most just of mankind, who never existed any where in this world.

How then can it\n\nbe said that the poet [Homer] knew nothing of the Scythians,\n\nsince he doubtless designates some of them by the names of\n\nHippemolgi and Galactophagi? And that the men of that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime called these people Hippemolgi even Hesiod is a witness\n\nin the words which Eratosthenes has quoted:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd when we consider the amount of fraud connected with\n\ntrading speculations even amongst ourselves, what ground\n\nhave we to wonder that Homer should have designated as the\n\njustest and most noble those who had but few commercial and\n\nmonetary transactions, and with the exception of their swords\n\nand drinking-cups, possessed all things in common, and especially their wives and children, who were cared for by the\n\nwhole community according to the system of Plato. schylus\n\ntoo seems to plead the poet's cause, when he says,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this is still the opinion entertained of them by the\n\nGreeks; for we esteem them the most sincere, the least deceitful of any people, and much more frugal and self-relying\n\nthan ourselves. And yet the manner of life customary among\n\nus has spread almost every where, and brought about a change\n\nfor the worse, effeminacy, luxury, and over-great refinement,\n\ninducing extortion in ten thousand different ways; and doubtless much of this corruption has penetrated even into the\n\ncountries of the nomades, as well as those of the other barbarians; for having once learnt how to navigate the sea, they\n\nhave become depraved, committing piracy and murdering\n\nstrangers; and holding intercourse with many different nations, they have imitated both their extravagance and their\n\ndishonest traffic, which may indeed appear to promote civility\n\nof manners, but do doubtless corrupt the morals and lead to\n\ndissimulation, in place of the genuine sincerity we have before noticed."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "He was called Idanthyrsus.

Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, relates that\n\nin this campaign the Kelts who dwell on the Adriatic came\n\nto Alexander for the purpose of making a treaty of friendship\n\nand mutual hospitality, and that the king received them in a\n\nfriendly way, and asked them, while drinking, what might be\n\nthe chief object of their dread, supposing that they would say\n\nit was he; but that they replied, it was no man, only they felt\n\nsome alarm lest the heavens should on some occasion or other\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfall on them, but that they valued the friendship of such a\n\nman as him above every thing. These examples sufficiently\n\nmanifest the open sincerity of the barbarians, both of the one\n\nwho would not suffer Alexander to land on the island, but\n\nnevertheless sent presents and concluded a treaty of friendship with him, and also of those who asserted that they feared\n\nno man, but that they valued the friendship of great men\n\nabove every price."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Diodorus Siculus, in Excerpt.

For Nestor is supposed to have lived at\n\nthe Triphyliac Pylus, the parts of which towards the south\n\nand the east (and these coincide towards Messenia and Laconia) was the country subject to Nestor, but the Caucones\n\nnow occupy it, so that those who are going from Pylus to\n\nLacedmon must necessarily take the road through the\n\nCaucones. The temple of the Samian Neptune, and the\n\nnaval station near it, where Telemachus landed, incline to the\n\nwest and to the north. If then the Caucones lived there only,\n\nthe account of the poet must be erroneous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[For, according to Sotades, Minerva enjoins Nestor to send\n\nhis son with Telemachus in a chariot to Lacedmon towards\n\nthe east, while she herself returns back to the west, to pass the\n\nnight in the vessel;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto obtain payment of the debt, in a forward direction. How\n\nthen are we to reconcile these opinions? for Nestor might\n\nsay,  Besides,\n\nit was natural for one, who was going to recover payment of\n\na debt, and that a considerable sum, as she says, from a people\n\nunder the command of Nestor, to request some assistance from\n\nhim in case they should be so unjust, as usually happens, as to\n\nrefuse to discharge it. But she did not do this."}, "If therefore the Caucones are to be found in one situation\n\nonly, these absurdities would follow.

For about the Trojan times, and even\n\nbefore that period, they were not in a flourishing state, having\n\nbeen reduced to a low condition by war with the Pylii, and\n\nafterwards by Hercules, when Augeas their king was overthrown. The proof is this. The Eleii sent forty ships to\n\nTroy, but the Pylians and Nestor ninety; then after the\n\nreturn of the Heracleidm the contrary happened. For the\n\ntoli returning with the Heracleid under the command of\n\nOxylus, became joint settlers with the Epeii, on the ground of\n\nancient affinity. They extended the bounds of Hollow Elis,\n\ngot possession of a large portion of the Pisatis, and subjected\n\nOlympia to their power. It was these people who invented\n\nthe Olympic games, and instituted the first Olympiad. For\n\nwe must reject the ancient stories both respecting the foundation of the temple, and the establishment of the games, some\n\nalleging that Hercules, one of the Idan Dactyli, was the\n\nfounder; others, that the son of Alcmene and Jupiter founded\n\nthem, who also was the first combatant and victor. For such\n\nthings are variously reported, and not entitled to much credit.\n\nIt is more probable, that from the first Olympiad, when\n\nCorcebus the Eleian was the victor in the race in the stadium,\n\nto the twenty-sixth, the Eleians presided over the temple, and\n\nat the games. But in the Trojan times, either there were no\n\ngames where a crown was awarded, or they had not yet acquired any fame, neither these nor any of the games which\n\nare now so renowned. Homer does not speak of these games,\n\nbut of others of a different kind, which were celebrated at\n\nfunerals. Some persons however are of opinion that he does\n\nmention the Olympic games, when he says, that Augeas detained four victorious horses, which had been sent to contend\n\nfor the prize. It is also said that the Pisat did not take any\n\npart in the Trojan war, being considered as consecrated to the\n\nservice of Jupiter. But neither was the Pisatis, the tract of\n\ncountry in which Olympia is situated, subject at that time to\n\nAugeas, but Eleia only, nor were the Olympic games cele-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbrated even once in the Eleian district, but always at Olympia.\n\nBut the games, of which Homer speaks, seem to have taken\n\nplace in Elis, where the debt was owing,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it was not in these, but in the Olympic games, that the\n\nvictor was crowned, for here they were to contend for a tripod."}, {"milestone": {"@ed": "P", "@n": "31", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "After the twenty-sixth Olympiad, the Pisat, having recovered their territory, instituted games themselves, when\n\nthey perceived that these games were obtaining celebrity.

It is, therefore, evident that Artemidorus, for this part of his work, scarcely did anything more than copy Agatharchides. Agatharchides, in his youth, held the situation of secretary or reader to Heraclides Lembus, who (according to Suidas) lived in the reign of Ptolemy Philometor. This king died B. C. . He wrote a work on Asia in 10 books, and one on Europe in 49 books; a geographical work on the Erythran Sea in 5 books; a treatise on the Troglody in 5 books; and other works. He wrote in the Attic dialect. His style, according to Photius, was dignified and perspicuous, and abounded in sententious passages, which inspired a favourable opinion of his judgment. In the composition of his speeches he was an imitator of Thucydides, whom he equalled in dignity, and excelled in clearness. His rhetorical talents also are highly praised by Photius.

These works, by their size and by the artifice and labour\n\nemployed in their construction, strike the beholder with astonishment and\n\nwonder. The base of the largest, the plan of which is quadrilateral, is\n\nseven plethra on each side; the height is more than six plethra; the pyramid gradually contracts towards the top, of which each side measures six\n\ncubits, and the whole is built of hard stone.

The stone is said to have\n\ncome from a great distance in Arabia, and the process of building was\n\ncarried on by raising mounds of earth; for at that period no machines had\n\nbeen invented.

Some Egyptians undertake to narrate wondrous\n\nstories respecting them, such, for instance, that the mounds above-mentioned were composed of salt and nitre, which melted away upon the\n\nrising of the river, and completely disappeared without the intervention\n\nof human labour. But this cannot be true, for the same number of\n\nhands which constructed the mounds would be able to reduce them again\n\nto their former state ; and 360,000 men, it is said, were employed in the\n\nundertaking.

To the gods\n\nProvidence assigned heaven; and the earth to men, the extreme parts of the world; for the extreme parts of the sphere\n\nare the centre and the circumference. But since water encompasses the earth, and man is not an aquatic, but a land-animal, living in the air, and requiring much light, Providence formed many eminences and cavities in the earth, so\n\nthat these cavities should receive the whole or a great part of\n\nthe water which covers the land beneath it; and that the eminences should rise and conceal the water beneath them, except\n\nso much as was necessary for the use of the human race, the\n\nanimals and plants about it.", {"pb": {"@n": "255"}, "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Book i. c. iii.  4."}, "milestone": {"@ed": "P", "@n": "37", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "But as all things are in constant motion, and undergo great\n\nchanges, (for it is not possible that things of such a nature, so\n\nnumerous and vast, could be otherwise regulated in the world,)\n\nwe must not suppose the earth or the water always to continue in this state, so as to retain perpetually the same bulk,\n\nwithout increase or diminution, or that each preserves the\n\nsame fixed place, particularly as the reciprocal change of one\n\ninto the other is most consonant to nature from their proximity; but that much of the land is changed into water, and\n\na great portion of water becomes land, just as we observe great\n\ndifferences in the earth itself.
