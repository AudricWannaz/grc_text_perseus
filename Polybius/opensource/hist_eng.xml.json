It was this peculiarity which originally challenged\nmy attention, and determined me on undertaking this work.\nAnd combined with this was the fact that no writer of our\ntime has undertaken a general history. Had any one done so\nmy ambition in this direction would have been much diminished. But, in point of fact, I notice that by far the greater\nnumber of historians concern themselves with isolated wars\nand the incidents that accompany them: while as to a general\nand comprehensive scheme of events, their date, origin, and\ncatastrophe, no one as far as I know has undertaken to\nexamine it. I thought it, therefore, distinctly my duty neither\nto pass by myself, nor allow any one else to pass by, without\nfull study, a characteristic specimen of the dealings of Fortune\nat once brilliant and instructive in the highest degree. For\nfruitful as Fortune is in change, and constantly as she is producing dramas in the life of men, yet never assuredly before\nthis did she work such a marvel, or act such a drama, as that\nwhich we have witnessed. And of this we cannot obtain a\ncomprehensive view from writers of mere episodes. It would\nbe as absurd to expect to do so as for a man to imagine\nthat he has learnt the shape of the whole world, its entire\narrangement and order, because he has visited one after the\nother the most famous cities in it; or perhaps merely examined\nthem in separate pictures. That would be indeed absurd: and\nit has always seemed to me that men, who are persuaded that\nthey get a competent view of universal from episodical\nhistory, are very like persons who should see the limbs of\nsome body, which had once been living and beautiful,\nscattered and remote; and should imagine that to be quite\nas good as actually beholding the activity and beauty of the\nliving creature itself. But if some one could there and then\n\nreconstruct the animal once more, in the perfection of its\nbeauty and the charm of its vitality, and could display it\nto the same people, they would beyond doubt confess that\nthey had been far from conceiving the truth, and had\nbeen little better than dreamers. For indeed some idea\nof a whole may be got from a part, but an accurate knowledge and clear comprehension cannot. Wherefore we\nmust conclude that episodical history contributes exceedingly little to the familiar knowledge and secure grasp of\nuniversal history.

The Carthaginian admiral\ncontented himself with either towing off or breaking up some\nfew of their vessels, and shortly afterwards coasted along under\nthe pretence of making for Heracleia: though he was really\nlying in wait, with the view of intercepting those who were\ncoming by sea to the Roman army. When his look-out men\nbrought him word that a considerable number of vessels of all\nsorts were bearing down upon him, and were now getting\nclose, he stood out to sea and started to meet them: for the\nsuccess just obtained over the Romans inspired him with such\ncontempt for them, that he was eager to come to an engagement. The vessels in question were those which had been\ndespatched in advance under the charge of the Quaestors\nfrom . And they too had warning of their danger.\nLight boats were accustomed to sail in advance of a squadron,\nand these announced the approach of the enemy to the\nQuaestors; who being convinced that they were not strong\nenough to stand a battle at sea, dropped anchor under a small\nfortified town which was subject to , and which, though\nit had no regular harbour, yet possessed roadsteads, and headlands\n  projecting from the mainland, and surrounding the\nroadsteads, so as to form a convenient refuge. There they\ndisembarked; and having set up some catapults and balistae,\nwhich they got from the town, awaited the approach of the\nenemy. When the Carthaginians arrived, their first idea was\nto blockade them; for they supposed that the men would\nbe terrified and retreat to the fortified town, leaving\nthem to take possession of the vessels without resistance.\nTheir expectations, however, were not fulfilled; and finding\nthat the men on the contrary resisted with spirit, and that\nthe situation of the spot presented many difficulties of every\ndescription, they sailed away again after towing off some\nfew of the transports laden with provisions, and retired to a\ncertain river, in which they anchored and kept a look out for\nthe enemy to renew their voyage."}}, {"@id": "b1c54", "@type": "chapter", "@n": "54", "head": "Shipwreck of the Roman Fleet", "p": {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Syracuse", "#text": "Syracuse"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003850", "#text": "Lilybaeum"}], "pb": {"@n": "63"}, "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, "ref": {"@target": "b1c37", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "ch. 37"}, "#text": "The dangerous nature of the S.

The fact is\nthat the latter of these two writers has, throughout the whole of his\nhistory, made statements at random and without discrimination.\nIt is not, however, necessary for me to criticise him on other\npoints on the present occasion, or to call him to strict account\nconcerning them; but such of his statements as relate to the\nperiod which I have now in hand, that is the Cleomenic war, these\nI must thoroughly sift. They will be quite sufficient to enable\nus to form a judgment on the general spirit and ability with\nwhich he approaches historical writing.  It was his object to\nbring into prominence the cruelty of Antigonus and the Macedonians, as well as that of Aratus and the\nAchaeans; and he accordingly asserts that, when\n fell into their hands, it was cruelly treated; and\nthat the most ancient and important of all the Arcadian\ntowns was involved in calamities so terrible as to move all\n to horror and tears. And being eager to stir the\nhearts of his readers to pity, and to enlist their sympathies\nby his story, he talks of women embracing, tearing their hair,\nand exposing their breasts; and again of the tears and\nlamentations of men and women, led off into captivity along\nwith their children and aged parents. And this he does again\nand again throughout his whole history, by way of bringing the\nterrible scene vividly before his readers. I say nothing of the\nunworthiness and unmanliness of the course he has adopted:\nlet us only inquire what is essential and to the purpose in\nhistory. Surely an historian's object should not be to amaze\nhis readers by a series of thrilling anecdotes; nor should he\naim at producing speeches which  have been delivered,\nnor study dramatic propriety in details like a writer of tragedy:\nbut his function is above all to record with fidelity what was\nactually said or done, however commonplace it may be. For\nthe purposes of history and of the drama are not the same, but\nwidely opposed to each other. In the former the object is to\nstrike and delight by words as true to nature as possible; in\nthe latter to instruct and convince by genuine words and\ndeeds; in the former the effect is meant to be temporary, in\nthe latter permanent.\n In the former, again, the power of\ncarrying an audience is the chief excellence. because the object\n\nis to create illusion; but in the latter the thing of primary\nimportance is truth, because the object is to benefit the\nlearner. And apart from these considerations, Phylarchus, in\nmost of the catastrophes which he relates, omits to suggest the\ncauses which gave rise to them, or the course of events which\nled up to them: and without knowing these, it is impossible to\nfeel the due indignation or pity at anything which occurs. For\ninstance, everybody looks upon it as an outrage that the free\nshould be struck: still, if a man provokes it by an act of violence,\nhe is considered to have got no more than he deserved; and,\nwhere it is done for correction and discipline, those who strike\nfree men are deemed worthy of honour and gratitude. Again,\nthe killing of a fellow-citizen is regarded as a heinous crime,\ndeserving the severest penalties: and yet it is notorious that the\nman who kills a thief, or his wife's paramour, is held guiltless;\nwhile he who kills a traitor or tyrant in every country receives\nhonours and pre-eminence. And so in everything our final judgment does not depend upon the mere things done, but upon their\ncauses and the views of the actors, according as these differ."}}, {"@id": "b2c57", "@type": "chapter", "@n": "57", "head": {"placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Mantinea", "#text": "Mantinea"}, "#text": "The Treatment of"}, "p": {"placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Mantinea", "#text": "Mantinea"}, "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "date": {"@value": "-227", "#text": "227"}, "#text": "B.

But at\nthis period the most exaggerated estimate could scarcely give\nmore than three hundred talents, as coming from \nitself; for it is acknowledged that most of the inhabitants, free\nand slaves, escaped to . But the strongest confirmation\nof my words is the case of , which, as he himself\nobserves, was second to no Arcadian city in wealth and numbers. Though it was surrendered after a siege, so that no one\ncould escape, and no property could without great difficulty be\nconcealed; yet the value of the whole spoil of the town, including the price of the captives sold, amounted at this same\nperiod to only three hundred talents."}}, {"@id": "b2c63", "@type": "chapter", "@n": "63", "head": "Cleomenes Invades Argolis", "p": {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Ptolemy Euergetes and Cleomenes."}, "pb": {"@n": "159"}, "#text": "But a more astonishing mis-statement remains to be remarked.

But\nwhen the Carthaginians had got the upper hand in this encounter and killed most of their opponents on the ground,\n\nbecause the Romans all maintained the fight with spirit and\ndetermination,and began chasing the remainder along the\nriver, slaying as they went and giving no quarter; then the\nlegionaries took the place of the light-armed and closed\nwith the enemy.

With these reinforcements, as well\nas his own army, Garsyeris advanced towards Pednelissus,\nfeeling certain that he would be able to raise the siege at the\n\nfirst attack: but when the Selgians showed no sign of alarm,\nhe entrenched himself at a moderate distance from them.\nThe Pednelissians were now becoming hard pressed from want\nof provisions; and Garsyeris, being anxious to do all he could,\ngot ready two thousand men, giving each a medimnus of\nwheat, and despatched them under cover of night into Pednelissus. But the Selgians getting intelligence of what was going\non, and, coming out to intercept them, most of those who\nwere carrying in the corn were killed, and the Selgians got\npossession of the wheat. Elated with this success, they now\nessayed to storm the camp of Garsyeris as well as the city. An\nadventurous daring in the presence of the enemy is indeed\ncharacteristic of the Selgians: and on this occasion they left a\nbarely sufficient number to guard their camp; and, surrounding\nthe enemy's entrenchment with the rest, assaulted it at several\npoints at once. Finding himself unexpectedly attacked on\nevery side, and portions of his palisade being already torn down,\nGarsyeris, appreciating the gravity of the danger, and feeling\nthat there was but little chance of averting total destruction,\nsent out some cavalry at a point which the enemy had left\nunguarded. These the Selgians imagined to be flying in a\npanic and for fear of what was coming: and therefore, instead\nof attending to them, they treated them with utter contempt.\nWhen these horsemen, however, had ridden round, so as to\nget on the rear of the enemy, they charged and fought with\ngreat fierceness. This raised the spirits of Garsyeris's infantry,\nthough they had already given way: and they therefore faced\nround, and once more offered resistance to the troops that were\nstorming their camp. The Selgians, accordingly, being now\nattacked on front and rear at once, broke and fled. At the\nsame time the Pednelissians sallied out and attacked the\ntroops left in charge of the Selgian camp, and drove them out.\nThe pursuit lasted to so great a distance that no less than\nten thousand of the Selgian army fell: of the survivors all\nwho were allies fled to their own cities; while the Selgians\nthemselves escaped over the highlands into their native land."}}, {"@id": "b5c74", "@type": "chapter", "@n": "74", "head": {"placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Selge", "#text": "Selge"}, "#text": "Panic at"}, "p": {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Selge", "#text": "Selge"}, {"@key": "perseus,Selge", "#text": "Selge"}, {"@key": "tgn,7001317", "#text": "Thrace"}], "pb": {"@n": "426"}, "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Selge", "#text": "Selge"}, "#text": "Panic at ."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Antiochus Hierax, son of Antiochus II."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "ref": [{"@target": "b5c43", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "5, 43"}, {"@target": "b8c22", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "8, 22-23"}], "#text": "Laodice was sister of the wife of Antiochus () and a daughter of\nKing Mithridates ()."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Logbasis turns traitor."}], "#text": "Garsyeris immediately started in pursuit of the\nfugitives, being in haste to get over the narrow pass, and\napproach , before they could make a stand, and form any\n\nplan for meeting his approach.

For as the citadel\ncommanded the entrance to the harbour, the Tarentines could\nnot use their ships nor sail out of it; while the Romans could\nget supplies conveyed to them by sea without danger: and as\nlong as that was the case, it was impossible that the city should\nhave any security for its freedom.

The Tarentines were\nfully convinced by his words: but how it was to be brought\nabout in the present state of affairs they could form no idea,\nunless a fleet should appear from ; which at that\ntime of the year was impossible. They therefore said that they\ncould not understand what Hannibal was aiming at in these\nremarks to them.

The truth was that Hannibal had noticed that the\nbroad street, which was at once within the wall separating the\ntown from the citadel, and led from the harbour into the open\nsea, was well suited for the purpose; and he had conceived the\nidea of dragging the ships out of the harbour to the sea on\nthe southern side of the town. Upon his disclosing his idea to\nthe Tarentines, they not only expressed their agreement with\nthe proposal, but the greatest admiration for himself; and made\nup their minds that there was nothing which his acuteness and\ndaring could not accomplish. Trucks on wheels were quickly\nconstructed: and it was scarcely sooner said than done, owing\nto the zeal of the people and the numbers who helped to work\nat it.

The moral is, not to give up\nany useful accomplishment on account of its apparent difficulties, but to persevere till it becomes a matter of habit,\nwhich is the way mankind have obtained all good things.

For owing to the populousness and\nwealth of the country, the droves of swine in Italy are exceedingly large, especially along the sea coast of the Tuscans\nand Gauls: for one sow will bring up a thousand pigs, or sometimes even more. They therefore drive them out from their\nnight styes to feed, according to their litters and ages.

The reason I will now proceed to state. It will\n\nnot, perhaps, to most people seem to his credit, and it is in\ntruth the real source of his errors. For whereas he is thought\nto have possessed great and wide knowledge, a faculty for historical inquiry, and extraordinary industry in the execution of his\nwork, in certain cases he appears to have been the most ignorant\nand indolent person that ever called himself an historian. And\nthe following considerations will prove it.  Nature\nhas bestowed on us two instruments of inquiry and research, hearing and sight.\nOf these sight is, according to Heracleitus, by far\nthe truer; for eyes are surer witnesses than ears.\nAnd of these channels of learning Timaeus has\nchosen the pleasanter and the worse; for he entirely retrained\nfrom looking at things with his own eyes, and devoted himself\nto learning by hearsay. But even the ear may be instructed in\ntwo ways, reading and answers to personal inquiries: and in\nthe latter of these he was very indolent, as I have already\nshown. The reason of his preference for the other it is easy\nto divine. Study of documents involves no danger or fatigue,\nif one only takes care to lodge in a city rich in such records,\nor to have a library in one's neighbourhood. You may then\ninvestigate any question while reclining on your couch, and\ncompare the mistakes of former historians without any fatigue\nto yourself. But personal investigation demands great exertion\nand expense; though it is exceedingly advantageous, and in\nfact is the very corner-stone of history. This is evident from\nthe writers of history themselves. Ephorus says, \"if writers\ncould only be present at the actual transactions, it would be far\nthe best of all modes of learning.\" Theopompus says, \"the best\nmilitary historian is he who has been present at the greatest\nnumber of battles; the best speech maker is he who has been\nengaged in most political contests.\" The same might be said\nof the art of healing and of steering. Homer has spoken even\nmore emphatically than these writers on this point. For when\nhe wishes to describe what the man of light and leading should\nbe, he introduces Odysseus in these words\n\nand then goes on\n\n\nand again"}}, {"@id": "b12c28", "@type": "chapter", "@n": "28", "head": "Mere Inquiry Is Insufficient", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Historians must be practical men."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "bibl": [{"@n": "Plat.

Plato says that \"human affairs will not go well\nuntil either philosophers become kings or kings\nbecome philosophers.\" So I should say that\nhistory will never be properly written, until either\nmen of action undertake to write it (not as they do now, as a\nmatter of secondary importance; but, with the conviction that\nit is their most necessary and honourable employment, shall\ndevote themselves through life exclusively to it), or historians\nbecome convinced that practical experience is of the first importance for historical composition. Until that time arrives there\nwill always be abundance of blunders in the writings of historians.\nTimaeus, however, quite disregarded all this. He spent his\nlife in one place, of which he was not even a citizen; and thus\ndeliberately renounced all active career either in war or politics,\nand all personal exertion in travel and inspection of localities:\nand yet, somehow or another, he has managed to obtain the\nreputation of a master in the art of history.  To prove that\nI have not misrepresented him, it is easy to bring the\nevidence of Timaeus himself. In the preface\nto his sixth book he says that \"some people\nsuppose that more genius, industry, and\npreparation are required for rhetorical than for historical\ncomposition.\" And that \"this opinion had been formerly\nadvanced against Ephorus.\" Then because this writer had\nbeen unable to refute those who held it, he undertakes himself\nto draw a comparison between history and rhetorical compositions: a most unnecessary proceeding altogether. In the first\nplace he misrepresents Ephorus. For in truth, admirable as\nEphorus is throughout his whole work, in style, treatment, and\nargumentative acuteness, he is never more brilliant than in his\ndigressions and statements of his personal views: in fact, whenever he is adding anything in the shape of a commentary or a\n\nnote. And it so happens that his most elegant and convincing\ndigression is on this very subject of a comparison between\nhistorians and speech-writers. But Timaeus is anxious not\nto be thought to follow Ephorus.

But he exaggerates these so much, that he could not have himself\nexpected to be believed. One would be glad to ask the\nhistorian which of the two he thinks is the more expensive\nand laborious,to remain quietly at home and collect records\nand study the customs of Ligures and Celts, or to obtain\npersonal experience of all the tribes possible, and see them\nwith his own eyes? To ask questions about manuvres on\nthe field of battle and the sieges of cities and fights at sea\nfrom those who were present, or to take personal part in the\ndangers and vicissitudes of these operations as they occur?\nFor my part I do not think that real buildings differ so much\nfrom those in stage - scenery, nor history from rhetorical\ncompositions, as a narrative drawn from actual and personal\nexperience differs from one derived from hearsay and the\nreport of others. But Timaeus had no such experience: and\nhe therefore naturally supposed that the part of an historian's\nlabour which is the least important and lightest, that namely\nof collecting records and making inquiries from those who had\nknowledge of the several events, was in reality the most\nimportant and most difficult. And, indeed, in this particular\ndepartment of research, men who have had no personal experience must necessarily fall into grave errors. For how is a\n\nman, who has no knowledge of such things, to put the right\nquestions as to manuvering of troops, sieges of cities, and\nfights at sea? And how can he understand the details of\nwhat is told him? Indeed, the questioner is as important as\nthe narrator for getting a clear story. For in the case of men\nwho have had experience of real action, memory is a sufficient\nguide from point to point of a narrative: but a man who has\nhad no such experience can neither put the right questions,\nnor understand what is happening before his eyes.

He did not, however, give\nup all hopes of Syphax; but as their forces\nwere not far apart he kept sending messages to\nhim, convinced that he would be able to detach him from the\nCarthaginians. He still cherished the belief that Syphax was\ngetting tired of the girl for whose sake he had joined the\nCarthaginians, and of his alliance with the Punic people\ngenerally; for the Numidians, he knew, were naturally quick\nto feel satiety, and constant neither to gods nor men. Scipio's\nmind, however, was distracted with various anxieties, and his\nprospects were far from seeming secure to him; for he shrank\nfrom an engagement in the open field on account of the\nenemy's great superiority in numbers. He therefore seized an\nopportunity which now presented itself. Some of his messengers to Syphax reported to him that the Carthaginians had\nconstructed their huts in their winter camp of various kinds of\nwood and boughs without any earth; while the old army of the\nNumidians made theirs of reeds, and the reinforcements which\nwere now coming in from the neighbouring townships constructed\ntheirs of boughs only, some of them inside the trench and palisade, but the greater number outside. Scipio therefore made up\nhis mind that the manner of attacking them, which would be\nmost unexpected by the enemy and most successful for himself,\nwould be by fire. He therefore turned his attention to\norganising such an attack.  Now, in his communications with\nScipio, Syphax was continually harping upon his\nproposal that the Carthaginians should evacuate\nItaly and the Romans Libya; and that the possessions held by either between these two countries should\nremain in  Hitherto Scipio had refused to listen to\nthis suggestion, but he now gave Syphax a hint by the mouth\nof his messengers that the course he wished to see followed\nwas not impossible. Greatly elated at this, Syphax became\nmuch bolder than before in his communications with Scipio;\n\nthe numbers of the messengers sent backwards and forwards,\nand the frequency of their visits, were redoubled; and they\nsometimes even stayed several days in each other's camps\nwithout any thought of precaution. On these occasions\nScipio always took care to send, with the envoys, some men of\ntried experience or of military knowledge, dressed up as slaves\nin rough and common clothes, that they might examine and\ninvestigate in security the approaches and entrances to both\nthe entrenchments. For there were two camps, one that of\nHasdrubal, containing thirty thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry; and another about ten stades distant from it of the\nNumidians, containing ten thousand cavalry and about fifty thousand infantry. The latter was the easier of approach, and its\nhuts were well calculated for being set on fire, because, as I\nsaid before, the Numidians had not made theirs of timber and\nearth, but used simply reeds and thatch in their construction."}}, {"@id": "b14c2", "@type": "chapter", "@n": "2", "head": "Scipio Prepares to Attack Utica by Sea", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "date": {"@value": "-203", "#text": "203"}, "#text": "Spring of B.

He wished the enemy to believe that he was\ndoing this for the sake of carrying on the siege; but he really\nmeant it as a cover for his men, who were to be engaged in the\nundertaking described above, to prevent the garrison sallying\nout, when the legions were separated from their lines,\nassaulting the palisade which was so near to them, and attacking the division left in charge of it. Whilst in the midst of\nthese preparations, he sent to Syphax inquiring whether, \"in\ncase he agreed to his proposals, the Carthaginians would\nassent, and not say again that they would deliberate on the\nterms?\" He ordered these legates at the same time not to\nreturn to him, until they had received an answer on these\npoints. When the envoys arrived, the Numidian king was\nconvinced that Scipio was on the point of concluding the\nagreement, partly from the fact that the ambassadors said that\nthey would not go away until they got his answer, and partly\n\nbecause of the anxiety expressed as to the disposition of the\nCarthaginians. He therefore sent immediately to Hasdrubal,\nstating the facts and urging him to accept the peace. Meanwhile he neglected all precautions himself, and allowed the\nNumidians, who were now joining, to pitch their tents where\nthey were, outside the lines.

Everything having thus succeeded to his best\nwishes, Scipio fell upon these men outside their camp, and\neither put them to the sword, or, driving them back into\nthe camp, set fire to their huts. The disaster of the Punic\narmy was thus very like that which had just befallen the\nNumidians, fire and sword in both cases combining to destroy\nthem. Hasdrubal immediately gave up all idea of combating\nthe fire, for he knew from the coincidence of the two that the\nfire in the Numidian camp was not accidental, as he had\nsupposed, but had originated from some desperate design of\nthe enemy. He therefore turned his attention to saving his\nown life, although there was now little hope left of doing so.\nFor the fire was spreading rapidly and was catching everywhere; while the camp gangways were full of horses, beasts of\nburden, and men, some of them half dead and devoured by\nthe fire, and others in a state of such frantic terror and mad\nexcitement that they prevented any attempts at making a\ndefence, and by the utter tumult and confusion which they\ncreated rendered all chance of escape hopeless. The case of\nSyphax was the same as that of Hasdrubal, as it was also that\n\nof the other officers.

For it was by\ntheir bringing Philip into the Peloponnese, and humbling the\nLacedaemonians, that these men in the first place enabled all\nits inhabitants to breathe again, and conceive the idea of\nliberty; and in the next place, by recovering the territory and\ncities which the Lacedaemonians in the hour of prosperity had\ntaken from the Messenians, Megalopolitans, Tegeans, and\nArgives, notoriously raised the fortunes of their own countries.

For, indeed, though generals and princes\nconstantly employ traitors for their own purposes; yet when\nthey have got all they can out of them, they\ntreat them thenceforth as traitors, as Demosthenes says; very naturally considering that\nthose, who have put their country and original friends into the\nhands of their enemies, are never likely to be really loyal or\nto keep faith with themselves. Nay, even though they escape\nviolence at the hands of these, yet they do not easily avoid\nthe vengeance of those whom they betrayed.

Yet, though all this is true, nobody who\nwanted one was ever at a loss for a traitor, except in the rarest\ncases. From which one might say with some plausibility that\nman, reputed the most cunning of animals, gives considerable\ngrounds for being regarded as the stupidest.

This seems impossible\n  to Greek habits, but to those of Rome it is easy.  For\nthe Greeks find it difficult to hold even their\nsarissae on the march, and can scarcely bear\nthe fatigue of them; but the Romans strap\ntheir shields to their shoulders with leathern\nthongs, and, having nothing but their javelins in their hands,\ncan stand the additional burden of a stake. There is also\na great difference between the stakes employed by the two\npeoples. The Greeks hold that the best stake is that which\nhas the largest and most numerous shoots growing round the\nstem; but the Roman stakes have only two or three side shoots,\nor at most four; and those are selected which have these\nshoots on one side only. The result is that their porterage is\nvery easy (for each man carries three or four packed together),\nand they make an exceedingly secure palisade when put\ninto use. For the Greek palisading, when set in the front of\nthe camp, in the first place can easily be pulled down; for\nsince the part that is firm and tightly fixed in the ground is\nsingle, while the projecting arms of it are many and large, two\nor three men can get hold of the same stake by its projecting\narms, and easily pull it up; and directly that is done, its\nbreadth is so great that a regular gateway is made: and because\nin such a palisade the stakes are not closely interlaced or\ninterwoven with each other, when one is pulled up the part\nnext to it is made insecure. With the Romans it is quite\ndifferent. For as soon as they fix their stakes, they interlace\nthem in such a manner that it is not easy to know to which of\nthe stems fixed in the ground the branches belong, nor on\nwhich of these branches the smaller shoots are growing.\nMoreover, it is impossible to insert the hand and grasp them,\nowing to the closeness of the interlacing of the branches and\nthe way they lie one upon another, and because the main\nbranches are also carefully cut so as to have sharp ends. Nor,\nif one is got hold of, is it easy to pull up: because, in the first\nplace, all the stakes are sufficiently tightly secured in the\nground to be self-supporting; and, in the second place, because\nthe man who pulls away one branch must, owing to the close\ninterlacing, be able to move several others in its train; and it is\nquite unlikely that two or three men should happen to get hold\n\nof the same stake. But even if, by the exertion of enormous\nforce, a man has succeeded in pulling one or another up, the\ngap is scarcely perceptible. Considering, therefore, the vast\nsuperiority of this method, both in the readiness with which\nsuch stakes are found, the ease with which they are carried,\nand the security and durability of the palisade made with\nthem, it is plain, in my opinion, that if any military operation\nof the Romans deserves to be admired and imitated, it is this."}}, {"@id": "b18c19", "@type": "chapter", "@n": "19", "head": "Flamininus and Philip Nearing Each Other", "p": [{"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Flamininus marches to Pherae in Thessaly."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Thebae Pthiotides."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "The advanced guards of the two armies meet."}], "#text": "After providing for contingencies by these preparations,\n\nFlamininus advanced with his whole force at a moderate pace,\nand, having arrived at about fifty stades from Pherae, pitched\na camp there; and next morning, just before\nthe morning watch, sent out some reconnoitring\nparties to see whether they could get any opportunity of discovering the position and movements of the\nenemy.

In that kingdom, besides all the\nother splendour and wealth, there was found in the treasury\nmore than six thousand talents of gold and silver: yet he was\nso far from coveting any of this, that he even refused to see it,\nand administered it by the hands of others; though he was far\nfrom being superfluously wealthy himself, but, on the contrary,\nwas very badly off.

Again, Publius\nScipio, son by blood of this Aemilius, and son by adoption\n\nof Publius called the Great, when he got possession of Carthage, reckoned the wealthiest city in the world,\ntook absolutely nothing from it for his own private use, either by purchase or by any other manner of acquisition whatever, although\nhe was by no means a very rich man, but very moderately so\nfor a Roman. But he not only abstained from the wealth of\nCarthage itself, but refused to allow anything from Africa at\nall to be mixed up with his private property.

But as a spark of\n\ntheir ancestral glory still survived, there were found some\nwho disliked the existing settlement and the complete\nsubservience to Macedonia: and they accordingly maintained a violent opposition to the policy of Ascondas and\nNeon, the ancestors of Brachylles, who were the\nmost prominent in the party which favoured\nMacedonia.  However, the party of Ascondas\neventually prevailed, owing to the following circumstance. Antigonus (Doson), who, after the death of Demetrius, was Philip's\nguardian, happened to be sailing on some business along the\ncoast of Boeotia; when off Larymna he was surprised by a\nsudden ebb of the tide, and his ships were left high and dry.\nNow just at that time a rumour had been spread that Antigonus meant to make a raid upon the country; and therefore\nNeon, who was Hipparch at the time, was patrolling the\ncountry at the head of all the Boeotian cavalry to protect it,\nand came upon Antigonus in this helpless and embarrassed position: and having it thus in his power to inflict a serious blow\nupon the Macedonians, much to their surprise he resolved to\nspare them. His conduct in so doing was approved by the other\nBoeotians, but was not at all pleasing to the Thebans. Antigonus, however, when the tide flowed again and his ships\nfloated, proceeded to complete the voyage to Asia on which\nhe was bound, with deep gratitude to Neon for having\nabstained from attacking him in his awkward position. \nAccordingly, when at a subsequent period\nhe conquered the Spartan Cleomenes and\nbecame master of Lacedaemon, he left Brachylles in\ncharge of the town, by way of paying him for the kindness\ndone him by his father Neon. This proved to be the beginning of a great rise in importance of the family of Brachylles.\nBut this was not all that Antigonus did for him: from that\ntime forward either he personally, or king Philip, continually\nsupported him with money and influence; so that before long\nthis family entirely overpowered the political party opposed to\nthem in Thebes, and forced all the citizens, with very few exceptions, to join the party of Macedonia.

But the\nperusal of a letter received from Lucius and Publius Scipio\nhad served to a great extent to relieve his anxiety, and give\nhim a tolerably correct forecast of the result of the war.  For\nthe Scipios had put the case with great clearness\nin their letter, and had supported their assertions\nby numerous proofs. They entered not only\nupon a defence of the policy adopted by themselves, but of that\nalso of the Roman people generally; by which they showed\nthat, so far from depriving any of the existing kings of their\nsovereignties, they had themselves been the authors in some\ncases of their establishment, in others of the extension of their\npowers and the large increase of their dominions. To prove this\nthey quoted the instances of Andobales and Colichas in Iberia,\nof Massanissa in Libya, and of Pleuratus in Illyria, all of whom\nthey said they had raised from petty and insignificant princes\nto the position of undisputed royalty. They further mentioned\nthe cases of Philip and Nabis in Greece.

For a considerable number of days the besieged\ndid not discover them carrying the earth away through the\nshaft; but when the heap of earth thus brought out became\ntoo high to be concealed from those inside the\ncity, the commanders of the besieged garrison\nset to work vigorously digging a trench inside,\nparallel to the wall and to the stoa which faced the towers.\nWhen the trench was made to the required depth, they next placed\nin a row along the side of the trench nearest the wall a number\nof brazen vessels made very thin; and, as they walked along the\nbottom of the trench past these, they listened for the noise of\nthe digging outside. Having marked the spot indicated by\nany of these brazen vessels, which were extraordinarily sensitive\nand vibrated to the sound outside, they began digging from\nwithin, at right angles to the trench, another underground\ntunnel leading under the wall, so calculated as to exactly hit\nthe enemy's tunnel. This was soon accomplished, for the\nRomans had not only brought their mine up to the wall, but\nhad under-pinned a considerable length of it on either side of\ntheir mine; and thus the two parties found themselves face to\nface. At first they conducted this underground fighting with\ntheir spears: but as neither side could do much good, because\n\nboth parties protected themselves with shields and wattles,\nsome one suggested another plan to the defenders.  Putting in\nfront of them an earthenware jar, made to the width of the\nmine, they bored a hole in its bottom, and, inserting an iron funnel of the same length as the\ndepth of the vessel, they filled the jar itself with\nfine feathers, and putting a little fire in it close to the mouth\nof the jar, they clapped on an iron lid pierced full of holes.\nThey carried this without accident through the mine with its\nmouth towards the enemy. When they got near the besiegers\nthey stopped up the space all round the rim of the jar, leaving\nonly two holes on each side through which they thrust spears\nto prevent the enemy coming near the jar. They then took a\npair of bellows such as blacksmiths use, and, having attached\nthem to the orifice of the funnel, they vigorously blew up the\nfire placed on the feathers near the mouth of the jar, continually withdrawing the funnel in proportion as the feathers\nbecame ignited lower down. The plan was successfully executed; the volume of smoke created was very great, and, from\nthe peculiar nature of feathers, exceedingly pungent, and was\nall carried into the faces of the enemy. The Romans, therefore, found themselves in a very distressing and embarrassing\nposition, as they could neither stop nor endure the smoke in\nthe mines. The siege being thus still further protracted the\nAetolian commander determined to send an envoy to the Consul. . . ."}}, {"@id": "b21c29", "@type": "chapter", "@n": "29", "head": "Athens, Rhodes, and Athamania Intercede", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Intercession of Athens, Rhodes, and king Amynandrus."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "date": {"@value": "-191", "#text": "191"}, "#text": "Nothing seems to be known of this exile of Fulvius, who had been\ngranted an ovation in B.

Titus Flamininus\nhad for some time past been zealously working in Rome to\nsecure the restoration of Zeuxippus to Boeotia,\nbecause he had found him serviceable on many\noccasions during the wars with Antiochus and\nPhilip. And just at this time he had induced the Senate to\nsend a despatch to the Boeotians ordering them to recall\nZeuxippus and his fellow exiles. When this despatch arrived,\nthe Boeotians, fearing that, if these men were restored, they\nwould become detached from their good understanding with\nMacedonia, determined that the legal sentence upon\nZeuxippus and the rest should be publicly proclaimed,\nwhich they had formerly drawn up against them.  Thus they\ncondemned them on two charges, first, of sacrilege for\nhaving stripped off the silver from the plated table of Zeus,\nand, secondly, of murder for having killed\nBrachylles. Having made this arrangement,\nthey assumed that they need pay no further attention to the\ndespatch of the Senate, but contented themselves with sending\nCallicritus and others to Rome with the message that they\nwere unable to rescind what had been settled by their laws.\nZeuxippus having sent an embassy to the Senate at the same\ntime, the Romans wrote to the Aetolians and Achaeans an\naccount of the attitude assumed by the Boeotians, and ordered\nthem to restore Zeuxippus to his country. The Achaeans refrained from invading the country with an army, but selected\nsome ambassadors to go and persuade the Boeotians to obey\nthe orders from Rome; and also to settle the legal disputes\nexisting between them and the Achaeans, on the same principles as they conducted the administration of justice at home:\nfor it happened that there were some controversies between\nthe two nations that had been dragging on for a long time.\nOn receiving this message the Boeotians, whose Strategus was\nthen Hippias, promised at the moment that they would do\n\nwhat was demanded of them, but shortly afterwards neglected\nit at every point. Therefore, when Hippias had laid down his\noffice and Alcetas had succeeded him, Philopoemen gave all\nwho chose license to make reprisals on the territories of the\nBoeotians; which proved the beginning of a serious quarrel\nbetween the two nations. For on the cattle of Myrrichus and\nSimon being driven off, and a struggle arising over this\ntransaction, the contest soon ceased to be political, and became the beginning and prelude of open war. If indeed the\nSenate had persisted in carrying out the restoration of\nZeuxippus, war would quickly have been kindled; but as it\nmaintained silence on the subject, the Megareans were induced\nby an embassy proposing terms to stop the reprisals. . . ."}}, {"@id": "b22c5", "@type": "chapter", "@n": "5", "head": "Quarrel Between Lycians and Rhodians", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Rhodes and the Lycians."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Something is lost in the text."}], "pb": {"@n": "306"}, "#text": "A quarrel arose between the Lycians and Rhodians from\n\nthe following causes.

Next they\nmention the invasion of Dolopia, and the visit\nof Perseus to Delphi, the plot against Eumenes at Delphi, and\nthe murder of the ambassadors in Boeotia; and\nfrom these they say sprang the war between\nPerseus and the Romans. But my contention is that it is of\nmost decisive advantage, both to historians and their readers,\nto know the causes from which the several events are born and\nspring. Most historians confound these, because they do not\nkeep a firm hold upon the distinction between a pretext and\na cause, or again between a pretext and a beginning of a war.\nAnd since events at the present time recall this distinction\nI feel compelled to renew my discussion of this subject. For\ninstance, of the events just referred to, the first\nthree are pretexts; the last twothe plot against\nEumenes, the murder of the ambassadors, and other similar\nthings that happened during the same periodare clear  of the war between Rome and Perseus, and of the final\noverthrow of the Macedonian kingdom; but not one of them\nis a  of these things. I will illustrate by examples. Just\nas we say that Philip son of Amyntas contemplated and\ndetermined upon accomplishing the war with Persia, while\nAlexander put into execution what he had projected, so in the\npresent instance we say that Philip son of Demetrius first projected\n  the last war against Rome, and had all his preparations\nready for the execution of his design, but that after his death\nPerseus became the agent in carrying out the undertaking\nitself. If this be true, the following also is clear: it is impossible that the causes\nof the war should have been subsequent to the death of him who resolved upon and projected it;\nwhich would be the case if we accepted the account of these\nhistorians; for the events alleged by them as its causes were\nsubsequent to the death of Philip. . . ."}}, {"@id": "b22c9", "@type": "chapter", "@n": "9", "head": "The Senate Investigates Philip", "p": [{"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "date": {"@value": "-185", "#text": "185"}, "#text": "Complaints lodged against Philip at Rome, B.

These incidents taken together made\nthe Rhodians ready to listen to anything against the king.\nSeizing on this pretext, the party of Deinon tried to discredit the despatch, asserting that it did not come from the\n\nRomans but from Eumenes, who wished to involve them\non any possible pretext in a war, and bring expense and\nperfectly unnecessary suffering upon the people. In support\nof their contention they put forward the fact that the man who\nbrought the letter was some obscure trainer or another; and\nasserted that the Romans were not accustomed to employ such\nmessengers, but were rather inclined to act with unnecessary\ncare and dignity in the despatch of such missives. When\nthey said this they were perfectly aware that the letter had\nreally been written by Lucretius: their object was to persuade\nthe Rhodian people to do nothing for the Romans readily, but\nrather to perpetually make difficulties, and thus give occasions\nfor offence and displeasure to crop up between the two nations.\nFor their deliberate purpose was to alienate Rhodes from the\nRoman friendship, and to join it to that of Perseus, by every\nmeans in their power. Their motives for thus clinging to\nPerseus were that Polyaratus, who was ostentatious and vain,\nhad become heavily in debt; and that Deinon, who was\navaricious and unscrupulous, had from the first relied on\nincreasing his wealth by getting presents from princes and\nkings. These speeches having been delivered, the Prytanis\nStratocles rose, and, after inveighing at some length against\nPerseus, and speaking with equal warmth in praise of the\nRomans, induced the people to confirm the decree for the\ndespatch of the ships. Forthwith six quadriremes were prepared, five of which were sent to Chalcis under the command\nof Timagoras, and the other under the command of another\nTimagoras to Tenedos. This latter commander fell in at\nTenedos with Diophanes, who had been despatched by\nPerseus to Antiochus, and captured both him and his crew.\nAll such allies as arrived with offers of help by sea Lucretius\nthanked warmly, but excused from taking part in this service,\nobserving that the Romans had no need of naval support. . . ."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "summary", "@place": "inline", "@resp": "ess", "pb": {"@n": "363"}, "bibl": {"@n": "Liv. 42.51", "#text": "42, 51-62"}, "date": {"@value": "-171", "#text": "171"}, "#text": "Perseus now collected a large army at Citium, thirty-nine\nthousand foot and four thousand horse, and advanced through the\nnorth of Thessaly taking many towns, and finally taking up\nhis quarters at Sicyrium, at the foot of Mount Ossa.

Their\nconduct, to my mind, was like what one sees at gymnastic\ncontests.

But when, as\nthe fight went on, he showed that he was a match for his\nantagonist, and even gave him a well-placed wound, there was\na general clapping of hands, and the popular enthusiasm\nshowed itself loudly on his side, the spectators calling out to\nAristonicus to keep up his spirits.

He had long\n\nbeen connected by friendship with the royal\nhouse of Macedonia, but was now compelled\nby the force of circumstances to embrace the\nside of Perseus, the cause of which was as\nfollows: There was a certain Epirote named Charops, a man\nof high character, and well disposed to Rome, who, when\nPhilip was holding the passes into Epirus, was the cause of\nhis being driven from the country, and of Titus Flamininus\nconquering Epirus and Macedonia. Charops had a son\nnamed Machatus, who had a son also named Charops.\nMachatus having died when this son was quite a youth, the\nelder Charops sent his grandson with a suitable retinue to\nRome to learn to speak and read Latin. In the course of\n\ntime the young man returned home, having made many intimate friendships at Rome.  The elder Charops\nthen died, and the young man, being of a restless\nand designing character, began giving himself airs and attacking the distinguished men in the country. At first he was not\nmuch noticed, Antinous and Cephalus, his superiors in age and\nreputation, managing public affairs as they thought right. But\nwhen the war with Perseus broke out, the young man at once\nbegan laying information against these statesmen at Rome,\ngrounding his accusations on their former intimacy with the\nMacedonian royal family; and by watching everything they said\nor did, and putting the worst construction on it, suppressing\nsome facts and adding others, he succeeded in getting his accusations against them believed. Now Cephalus had always shown\ngood sense and consistency, and at the present crisis had\nadhered to a course of the highest wisdom. He had begun\nby praying heaven that the war might not take place, or the\nquestion come to the arbitrament of arms; but when the war\nwas actually begun, he was for performing all treaty obligations\ntowards Rome, but for not going a step beyond this, or showing any unbecoming subservience or officiousness. When\nCharops then vehemently accused Cephalus at Rome, and represented everything that happened contrary to the wishes of the\nRomans as malice prepense on his part, at first he and others\nlike him thought little of the matter, being not conscious of\nentertaining any designs hostile to Rome.  But when they saw\nHippolochus, Nicander, and Lochagus arrested\nwithout cause, and conveyed to Rome after\nthe cavalry battle, and that the accusations\nmade against them by Lyciscus were believed,Lyciscus\nbeing a leader of the same party in Aetolia as Charops was\nin Epirus,they at length began to be anxious about what\nwould happen, and to consider their position. They resolved\ntherefore to try every possible means to prevent themselves\nfrom being similarly arrested without trial and carried to\nRome, owing to the slanders of Charops.

But as to the money,\nhe said that it would be disgraceful to the one who paid, and\nstill more to the one who received it, to be supposed to remain\nneutral for hire; but the fifteen hundred talents he would\nsend in charge of Polemocrates and others to Samothrace,\nto be held as a deposit there. Now Perseus was master of\nSamothrace; but as Eumenes, like a poor physician, preferred\na retaining-fee to a payment after work, he finally gave up\nthe attempt, when he found that his own craftiness was no\n\nmatch for the meanness of Perseus. They thus parted on\nequal terms, leaving, like good athletes, the battle of avarice\na drawn one. Some of these details leaked out at the time,\nand others were communicated subsequently to Perseus's\nintimate friends; and he has taught us by them that every\nvice is clinched, so to speak, by avarice."}}, {"@id": "b29c9", "@type": "chapter", "@n": "9", "head": "The Avarice of Perseus", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Reflexions on the blindness of the avaricious kings."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "bibl": {"@n": "Plut.

And\nhow could he expect not to be detected by the Romans in\ntaking so large a sum? If he had concealed it at the time he\ncertainly would not have done so long. Moreover, he would\nhave been bound at any rate, in return for it, to have adopted\nthe quarrel with Rome; in which he would have been certain\nto have lost the money and his kingdom together, and very\nprobably his life also, by coming forward as an enemy of the\nRomans.

And again, as to Perseuswho could\nfail to be surprised at his thinking anything of higher importance, or more to his advantage, than to give the money and\nallow Eumenes to swallow the bait? For if, on the one hand,\nEumenes had performed any part of his promises, and had\nput an end to the war, the gift would have been well bestowed;\nand if, on the other hand, he had been deceived of that\nhope, he could at least have involved him in the certain\nenmity of Rome; for he would have had it entirely in his\nown power to make these transactions public. And one may\neasily calculate how valuable this would have been to Perseus,\nwhether he succeeded or failed in the war: for he would\nhave regarded Eumenes as the guilty cause of all his misfortunes, and could in no way have retaliated upon him more\neffectually than by making him an enemy of Rome. What\n\nthen was the root of all this blind folly? Nothing but\navarice.

He\nomitted the invectives against others, and took\nthe humble tone of men who are being flogged, begging to be forgiven, and declaring that his country had suffered sufficient\npunishment, and a more severe one than its crime deserved.  And\nthen he went briefly through the list of the Rhodian\nlosses. \"First, they have lost Lycia and Caria,\nwhich had already cost them a large sum of\nmoney, having been forced to support three wars against them;\nwhile at the present moment they have been deprived of a considerable revenue which they used to draw from those countries.\nBut perhaps,\" he added, \"this is as it should be: you gave\nthem to our people as a free gift, because you regarded us\nwith favour; and in now recalling your gift, because you suspect\nand are at variance with us, you may seem only to be acting\nreasonably. But Caunus, at any rate, we purchased from\nPtolemy's officers for two hundred talents; and Stratoniceia we\nreceived as a great favour from Antiochus, son of Seleucus;\nand from those two towns our people had a revenue of a\nhundred and twenty talents a year. All these sources of revenue\n\nwe have surrendered, in our submission to your injunctions.\nFrom which it appears that you have imposed a heavier\npenalty on the Rhodians for one act of folly, than on the\nMacedonians that have been continually at war with you. But\nthe greatest disaster of all to our State is that the revenue\nfrom its harbour has been abolished by your making Delos a\nfree port; and by your depriving our people of that independence by which the harbour, as well as other interests of the\nStates, were maintained in suitable dignity. And it is easy\nto satisfy yourselves of the truth of my words. Our revenue\nfrom harbour dues amounted in past years to one million\ndrachmae, from which you have now taken one hundred\nand fifty thousand; so that it is only too true, gentlemen of Rome, that your anger has affected the resources\nof the country. Now, if the mistake committed, and the\nalienation from Rome, had been shared in by the entire\npeople, you might perhaps have seemed to be acting rightly\nin maintaining a lasting and irreconcilable anger against\nus; but if the fact is made clear to you that it was an exceedingly small number who shared in this foolish policy, and that\nthese have all been put to death by this very people itself,\nwhy still be irreconcilable to those who are in no respect\nguilty? Especially when to every one else you are reputed\nto exhibit the highest possible clemency and magnanimity.\nWherefore, gentlemen, our people having lost their revenues,\ntheir freedom of debate, and their position of independence, in\ndefence of which in time past they have been ever willing to\nmake any sacrifices, now beg and beseech you all, as having\nbeen smitten sufficiently, to relax your anger, and to be reconciled and make this alliance with them: that it may be made\nmanifest to all the world that you have put away your anger\nagainst Rhodes, and have returned to your old feelings and\nfriendship towards them.\" Such among others were the\nwords of Astymedes.  He was thought to have\nspoken much to the point in the circumstances;\nbut what helped the Rhodians to the alliance\n\nmore than anything else was the recent return\nof the embassy under Tiberius Gracchus.  For\nhe gave evidence, in the first place, that the\nRhodians had obeyed all the decrees of the Senate; and in\nthe next place, that the men who were the authors of their\nhostile policy had all been condemned to death; and by this\ntestimony overcame all opposition, and secured the alliance\nbetween Rome and Rhodes. . . ."}}, {"@id": "b31c8", "@type": "chapter", "@n": "8", "head": "Envoys from Achaia in the Senate", "p": {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "date": [{"@value": "-165", "#text": "165"}, {"@value": "-167", "#text": "167"}], "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "dtenus,"}, "ref": {"@target": "b30c13", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "30, 13"}, "bibl": {"@n": "Paus. 7.10.11", "#text": "Pausan. 7.10.11"}, "#text": "B.

And when Demetrius took possession of the\ngovernment, he went to the king exhorting him to have no\nfear about the murder of Gnaeus, nor to adopt any measures\nof severity against the Laodiceans: for that he would himself\ngo to Rome and convince the Senate that he had done this\ndeed in accordance with the will of the gods.

To such an extent did the panic\ngo, that sufficient men were not found to come forward for the\noffice of military tribune, and these posts were consequently\nnot entirely filled up; whereas heretofore a larger number\nthan were wanted had been wont to volunteer for the duty:\nnor would the men nominated by the Consuls as  to\naccompany the commanders consent to serve; and, worst of\nall, the young men tried to avoid the levies, and put forward\nsuch excuses as were disgraceful for them to allege, and\nbeneath the investigation of the Consuls, and yet impossible\nto refute.  But at length, in this embarrassment of the Senate\nand magistrates, when they were wondering what was to be\nthe end of this shameless conduct of the young\nmen, for they could call it nothing else, Publius\nCornelius Scipio Africanus, who, though still a\nyoung man, had been one of those to advise the war, and\nwho, though he had already acquired a reputation for high\nprinciple and pure morality, had not been known for his\npersonal courage, seeing the Senate was in a difficulty, stood\nup and bade them send him to Iberia, either as military\n\ntribune or legatus, for he was ready to serve in either capacity.\n\"Though, as far as I am concerned,\" he said, \"my mission\nto Macedonia would be safer and more appropriate\"for it\nhappened that at that time Scipio was personally and by name invited by the Macedonians to come and settle the disputes which\nwere raging among them\"yet the needs of my own country\nare the more pressing of the two, and imperatively summon\nto Iberia all who have a genuine love of honour.\"  This offer\nwas unexpected by all, both from the youth of\nScipio and his general character for caution,\nand consequently he became exceedingly popular on the spot, and still more so on subsequent days. For\nthose who had before shrunk from the danger of the service,\nnow, from dislike of the sorry figure they made in comparison\nwith him, began volunteering to serve. Some offered to go as\n to the generals, and others in groups and clubs entered\ntheir names on the muster rolls. . . ."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@type": "summary", "@place": "inline", "@resp": "ess", "date": {"@value": "-151", "#text": "151"}, "#text": "Lucius Lucinius Lucullus, consul for B.

The opinions expressed in\nregard to the Carthaginians were widely divided,\nand indicated entirely opposite views. Some commended the\nRomans for their wise and statesmanlike policy in regard to\nthat kingdom. For the removal of a perpetual menace, and the\nutter destruction of a city which had disputed the supremacy\nwith them, and could even then if it got an opportunity have\nstill been disputing it,thus securing the supremacy for their\nown country,were the actions of sensible and far-sighted men.\nOthers contradicted this, and asserted that the Romans had no\nsuch policy in view when they obtained their supremacy; and\nthat they had gradually and insensibly become perverted to\nthe same ambition for power, which had once characterised\nthe Athenians and Lacedaemonians; and though they had\nadvanced more slowly than these last, that they would from\nall appearances yet arrive at the same consummation. For\nin old times they had only carried on war until their opponents\nwere beaten, and induced to acknowledge the obligation of\nobedience and acceptance of their orders; but that nowadays\nthey had given a foretaste of their policy by their conduct to\nPerseus, in utterly destroying the Macedonian dynasty root and\nbranch, and had given the finishing stroke to that policy by the\ncourse adopted in regard to the Carthaginians; for though this\nlatter people had committed no act of irretrievable outrage,\nthey had taken measures of irretrievable severity against them,\nin spite of their offering to accept any terms, and submitting to\nany injunctions that might be placed upon them. Others\n\nagain said that the Romans were generally a truly civilised\npeople; and that they had this peculiarity, on which they\nprided themselves, that they conducted their wars openly and\ngenerously, not employing night surprises or ambuscades, but\nscorning every advantage to be gained by stratagem and\ndeceit, and regarding open and face-to-face combats as\nalone becoming to their character: but that in the present\ninstance their whole campaign against the Carthaginians had\nbeen conducted by means of stratagem and deceit. Little by\nlittle,by holding out inducements here, and practising concealment there,they had deprived them of all hopes of\nassistance from their allies. This was a line of conduct more\nappropriate by rights to the intriguing chicanery of a monarchy,\nthan to a republican and Roman policy. Again, there were\nsome who took the opposite line to these. They said that if\nit were really true that, before the Carthaginians had made\nthe surrender, the Romans had behaved as alleged, holding\nout inducements here, and making half revelations there, they\nwould be justly liable to such charges; but if, on the contrary, it was only after the Carthaginians had themselves made\nthe surrender,acknowledging the right of the Romans to take\nwhat measures they chose concerning them,that the latter in\nthe exercise of their undoubted right had imposed and enjoined\nwhat they determined upon, then this action must cease to be\nlooked on as partaking of the nature of impiety or treachery.\nAnd some denied that it was an impiety at all: for there\nwere three ways in which such a thing could be defined, none\nof which applied to the conduct of the Romans. An impiety\nwas something done against the gods, or one's parents, or the\ndead; treachery was something done in violation of oaths or\nwritten agreements; an injustice something done in violation\nof law and custom. But the Romans could not be charged on\nany one of these counts: they had offended neither the gods,\ntheir parents, nor the dead; nor had they broken oaths or\ntreaties, but on the contrary charged the Carthaginians\nwith breaking them. Nor again had they violated laws, customs, or their own good faith; for having received a voluntary surrender, with the full power of doing what they pleased\nin the event of the submitting party not obeying their injunctions,\n  they had, in view of that eventuality having arisen, applied force to them."}}, {"@id": "b37c2", "@type": "chapter", "@n": "2", "head": "Pseudo-Philip", "p": [{"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "date": {"@value": "-149", "#text": "149"}, "#text": "The pretended Philip, son of Perseus, B.

Those things of\nwhich it is impossible or difficult for a mere\n\nman to ascertain the causes, such as a continuous fall of rains\nand unseasonable wet, or, on the contrary, droughts and frosts,\none may reasonably impute to God and Fortune, in default of\nany other explanation; and from them come destruction of\nfruits, as well as long-continued epidemics, and other similar\nthings, of which it is not easy to find the cause. On such\nmatters then, we, in default of a better, follow the prevailing\nopinions of the multitude, attempting by supplications and\nsacrifices to appease the wrath of heaven, and sending to\nask the gods by what words or actions on our part a change\nfor the better may be brought about, and a respite be obtained for the evils which are afflicting us. But those things,\nof which it is possible to find the origin and cause of their\noccurrence, I do not think we should refer to the gods. I\nmean such a thing as the following. In our time all Greece\nwas visited by a dearth of children and generally a decay of\npopulation, owing to which the cities were denuded of inhabitants, and a failure of productiveness resulted, though\nthere were no long-continued wars or serious pestilences\namong us. If, then, any one had advised our sending to ask the\ngods in regard to this, what we were to do or say in order to\nbecome more numerous and better fill our cities,would he\nnot have seemed a futile person, when the cause was manifest\nand the cure in our own hands? For this evil grew upon us\nrapidly, and without attracting attention, by our men becoming\nperverted to a passion for show and money and the pleasures\nof an idle life, and accordingly either not marrying at all, or, if\nthey did marry, refusing to rear the children that were born, or\nat most one or two out of a great number, for the sake of\nleaving them well off or bringing them up in extravagant\nluxury. For when there are only one or two sons, it is evident that, if war or pestilence carries off one, the houses must\nbe left heirless: and, like swarms of bees, little by little the\ncities become sparsely inhabited and weak. On this subject\nthere is no need to ask the gods how we are to be relieved\nfrom such a curse: for any one in the world will tell you that\nit is by the men themselves if possible changing their objects\nof ambition; or, if that cannot be done, by passing laws for the\npreservation of infants. On this subject there is no need of\n\nseers or prodigies. And the same holds good of all similar\nthings. But in regard to events of which the causes are impossible or difficult to discover, it is reasonable to feel a\ndifficulty. And in this class may be reckoned the course of\nMacedonian history. For the Macedonians had enjoyed\nmany important favours at the hands of the Romans, having\nbeen as a nation liberated from arbitrary government and\nimports, and having obtained undisputed freedom in the place\nof slavery; and having been individually relieved to a great\nextent from intestine factions and civil bloodshed. . . .  They\nhad been worsted by the Romans formerly\nwhen fighting on the side of Demetrius and\nagain on that of Perseus; yet when engaged on\nthe side of a man of odious character, and in support of his\nclaims to the throne, they displayed great courage and conquered a Roman army. These facts may well seem a puzzle\nto us, for it is difficult to discover their cause. And accordingly one would be inclined to say in such matters that what\nhad happened was a heaven-sent infatuation, and that the\nwrath of God had fallen upon the Macedonians.

He was succeeded in his\noffice of Strategus by Diaeus (autumn B.C.  - B. C. ) who\npromised Metellus to await the arrival of the commissioners\nfrom Rome.
