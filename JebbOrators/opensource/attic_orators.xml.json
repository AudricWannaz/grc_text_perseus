The oratorical branch of Attic prose has a more direct and more fruitful relation to the general development than modern analogies would suggest. To trace the course of Athenian oratory from its beginnings as an art to the days of its decline is, necessarily, to sketch the history of Greek prose expression in its most widely influential form, and to show how this form was affected by a series of causes, political or social.", {"pb": {"@n": "x"}, "#text": "The second object of the book is to supply an aid to the particular study of the Attic orators before Demosthenes. The artistic development of Attic oratory is sketched as a whole. But a separate and minute treatment is given only to Antiphon, Andokides, Lysias, Isokrates and Isaeos. The period thus specially determined has more than a correspondence with a practical need: it has an inner unity, resting on grounds which are stated in the Introduction and which are illustrated at each stage of the subsequent inquiry."}, {"title": "Geschichte der Beredsamkeit,", "pb": {"@n": "xi"}, "#text": "As regards the former and larger of these two purposes, the writer may venture to hope that his attempt, however imperfect, will be recognised at least as one for which, in this country, there is room. The History of Greek Literature by Otfried Mller translated and continued by Donaldsonhad been carried only to Isokrates when the author died, at the early age of forty-three, in 1840. Mller's chapters on The beginnings of regular Political and Forensic Oratory among the Athenians (XXXIII), on The new cultivation of Oratory by Lysias (XXXV), and on Isokrates (XXXVI) are, relatively to the plan of his work, very good: that is, they state clearly the chief characteristics of each writer separately. But this very plan precluded a full examination of each writer's works, and even a full discussion of his style. Nor does Mller appear to have regarded Oratory otherwise than as strictly a department, or adequately to have conceived its relation to the universal prose literature. The materials for a more comprehensive estimate had already been brought together in Westermann's  which carries the chronicle of technical rhetoric and of eloquence to the days of Chrysostom. But this great work is rather a storehouse of references than properly a history; and, owing to its vast compass and its annalistic method, gives too little space, proportionally, to the best\n period of Athens. Westermann's thesaurus and Mller's sketch have recently been supplemented by the excellent works of Dr F. Blass: (1) Die Attische Beredsamkeit von Gorgias bis zu Lysias, 1868: (2) Isokrates und Isaios, 1874of which the latter came into my hands only after my own chapters on Isokrates were almost wholly printed. I desire here to record in general terms my obligations to both these works. Particular debts are in every case, so far as I know, acknowledged on the page where they occur."}, "For the analyses of the orations it seemed best to adopt no uniform scale, but to make them more or less full according to the interest of the subjectmatter or the nature of its difficulties. In analysing the works of Isokrates, which abound in matter of literary or historical value, I have endeavoured to give the whole of the contents in a form easy of access, and, at the same time, to preserve the most characteristic features of expression. A careful analysis, whether copious or not, is necessarily to some extent a commentary, since the analyst must exhibit his view of the relation in which each part of the writer's meaning stands to the rest.", {"pb": [{"@n": "xii"}, {"@n": "xiii"}], "title": ["Ad Demonicum", "Panegyricus"], "#text": "In this sense, I hope that the analyses will serve my second and more special purposeto help students of these five orators who have nothing but a Greek text before them. Critical scholarship in\n England has done some of its best work on the orators before Demosthenes. The names of John Taylor, Markland, Robert Tyrwhitt, Dobree, Dobson, Churchill Babingtonto mention only a feware proof enough. But it is long since the orators before Demosthenes have been taken into the ordinary course of reading at our schools and universities. The commentary of Mr Sandys on Isokrates  and  is (so far as I know) alone in this country. Frohberger's selections from Lysias, Schneider's selections from Isokrates, Rauchenstein's selections from Lysias and from Isokrates, Bremi's selections from Lysias and from Aeschines, are representative of the German feeling that these Greek orators should be read by ordinary students. The principal reason why they have dropped out of school and university favour among ourselves is perhaps not difficult to assign. Demosthenes and (in his measure) Aeschines have a political and historical interest of a kind which every one recognises, and which lends dignity to ancient prose in the eyes of a public that is rather political than philological. Many speeches which Demosthenes did not write have long been studied among us in the belief that they were composed by that statesman; while, on the other hand, comparatively few know, or comprehend, the conjecture of Mr Freeman that every Athenian ekklesiast was equal in political intelligence to an\n average Member of Parliament. In truth, an oration taken at hazard from Antiphon, Andokides, Lysias, Isokrates or Isaeos, will often be poor food for the mind if it is read alone. What is necessary to make it profitable is some idea of the world in which it was spoken. These orators who were not conspicuous actors in history must be read, not fragmentarily or in the light of notes which confine themselves to explaining what are termed allusions, but more systematically, and with some general comprehension of the author and the age. Brougham, one of the best and most diligent critics of ancient oratory, himself tells us that he could not read Isaeos:the total want of interest in the subject, and the minuteness of the topics, has always made a perusal of them so tedious as to prevent us from being duly sensible of the force and keenness with which they are said to abound. If, however, Brougham had considered Isaeos, not as merely a writer on a series of willcases, but as the oldest and most vivid witness for the working of inchoate testation in a primitive society, and, on the other hand, as the man who, alone, marks a critical phase in the growth of Attic prose, it is conceivable that Brougham should have thought Isaeos worthy of the most attentive perusal."}, {"pb": [{"@n": "xiv"}, {"@n": "xv"}], "title": ["Demosthenes und seine Zeit,", "Hortensius,"], "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "peri\\ a)ntido/sews"}, "#text": "The present attempt to aid in giving Attic Oratory its due place in the history of Attic Prose was\n begun in the summer of 1870, and has since employed all the time that could be spared to it from the severe and almost incessant pressure of other occupations. In addition to the works of Dr Blass, I would name the exhaustive work of Arnold Schfer,  as one which has been my constant help. M. Perrot's L'loquence Politique et Judiciaire  Athnes: 1 Partie, Les Prcurseurs de Dmosthne, and Mr Forsyth's  also claim my gratitude.

That study has become, in a new and fuller sense, scientific. The Comparative Method, in its application to Language, to Literature, to Mythology, to Political or Constitutional History, has given to the classics a general interest and importance far greater than they possessed in the days when the devotion which they attracted was most exclusive. For the present, indeed, during a time of transition, the very breadth of the view thus opened is apt to be attended by a disadvantage of its own. So long as the study given to ancient Greece or Rome was practically confined to the short periods during which the literature of either was most brilliant, this study was often narrow, perhaps, but it was usually searching and sympathetic. The great masters in each kind were known at close quarters. Their excellence was not something taken on credit\n as giving them their claim to a place in a rapid survey. It was apprehended and felt. Paradoxes as to then relative merits were, therefore, not so easily commended to educated opinion in the name of a revolt from academical prescription. I remember to have seen an ingenious travesty of The Last Days of Pompeii, in which the sorcerer Arbaces had occasion to recite the praises of his countrymen, the Egyptians. The Greeks, Arbaces sang, are wonderfully clever; but  have invented the Greeks. Goethe said that Winckelmann had found the antique; but it appears sometimes to be forgotten that this merit is essentially distinct from that intimated by the Egyptian. In the meantime, I am persuaded that anyone will be doing useful work who makes a contribution, however slight, to that close study of the  Greek literature which ought ever to be united with attention to the place of Greece in the universal history of the mind.

This controversy involved principles by which every artistic creation must be judged; but, as it then came forward, it referred to the standard of merit in prose literature, and, first of all, in oratory. Are the true models those Attic writers of the fifth and fourth centuries, from Thucydides to Demosthenes, whose most general characteristics are, the subordination of the form to the thought, and the avoidance of such faults as come from a misuse of ornament?

Now, Caecilius, and his contemporary Didymos, the grammarian and critic of Alexandria, are the earliest writers who know this decade. Dionysios takes no notice whatever of the canon thus adopted by his friend. He seems never to have heard of the number ten in connexion with the Attic orators. But from the first century A.D. onwards the decade is established. It is attested, for instance, by the Lives of the Ten Orators, wrongly ascribed to Plutarch, but probably composed about 80 A.D.; by Quintilian; by the neoplatonist Proklos, about 450 A.D.; and by Suidas, about 1100 A.D. from whom it appears that, in his time, the grammarians had added a second list of ten to the first. The origin of the canon is unknown. It has been ascribed to Caecilius himself, mainly on the ground that it is not heard of before his time. It has been referred to Aristophanes the Byzantine, librarian at Alexandria about 200 B. C., or to his successor Aristarchos, about 156 B. C.,by whom a canon of the poets, at least, was certainly framed. Another view is that it arose simply from the general tendency to reduce the number of distinguished names in any field to\n a definite number,the tendency that gives the Seven Sages of Greece, the Seven Champions of Christendom, and the like. This last theory may safely be rejected. The decade includes at least three names which this kind of halo can never have surroundedAndokides, Isaeos and Deinarchos. It excludes other orators who, though inferior as artists, would have had a stronger popular claim, such as Kallistratos of Aphidnae, the chief organiser of the Athenian Confederacy in 378, of whom Demosthenes said, when asked whether he or Kallistratos were the better speaker, I, on paperKallistratos on the platform,his opponents, Leodamas of Acharnae, Aristophon of Azenia, Thrasybulos and Kephalos of Kollytos,or that vigorous member of the anti-Macedonian party, Polyeuktos of Sphettos. Clearly, this canon was framed once for all by a critic or a school from whose decree contemporary opinion allowed no appeal, was adopted by successive generations, and ultimately secured the preservation of the writings which it contained, while others, not so privileged, were neglected, and at last suffered to perish.

Even if Caecilius had been the framer of the decade, it can hardly be doubted that at least the idea must have been known through him to his intimate friend Dionysios before the latter had completed the series of works which we possess, and that we should find some trace of it in those long lists of orators which Dionysios frequently gives.

Now, his object in handling the Attic orators was  not to complete a set of biographies or essays, but to establish a standard for Greek prose, applicable alike to oratory and to every other branch of composition. He considers the orators, accordingly, less as individual writers than as representatives of tendencies. He seeks to determine their mutual relations, and, with the aid of the results thus obtained, to trace a historical development. The orators whom he chose as, in this sense, representative were six in number Lysias, Isokrates, Isaeos, Demosthenes, Hypereides, Aeschines. We have his treatises on Lysias, Isokrates,\n and Isaeos. We have also the first part of his treatise on Demosthenesthat part in which he discusses expression as managed by Demosthenes; the second part, in which he discussed the Demosthenic handling of subject-matter, has perished with his discourses on Hypereides and Aeschines. The treatise on Deinarchos, it need hardly be said, is bibliographical, and has nothing to do with the other series.  Dionysios considers his six orators as forming two classes. Between these classes the line is clearly drawn.

The men and the writings that mark this progress will need to be studied systematically and closely. It is hoped that much which is of historical, literary or social interest will be found by the way. But the great reward of the labour will be to get, if it may be, a more complete and accurate notion of the way in which Greek prose grew. It will not be enough, then, if we break off when the study of Isaeos has been finished. It will be necessary to look at the general characteristics of the mature political oratory built on those foundations at which Isaeos was the latest worker. It will be necessary to conceive distinctly how Isaeos and those before him were related to Lykurgos, Hypereides, Aeschines, Demosthenes. Nor must we stop here.

The term oratory, though the exigencies of the language lead to its often being used as a mere synonym for set speaking, is yet always inconveniently coloured with the same suggestion either of\n irony or of superlative praise. The Roman term  pleader, had this advantage over ours, that it related, not to a faculty, but to a professional or official attitude. It could therefore be applied to any one who stood in that attitude, whether effectively or otherwise. Thus the Romans could legitimately say mediocris or malus orator, whereas, in English, the corresponding phrases are either incorrect or sarcastic.

Already, before the art of Rhetoric had  become an elaborate system, the orators were accustomed to prepare themselves for their task by laborious training, first in composition, then in delivery. They make no secret of this. They are not ashamed of it. On the contrary, they avow it and insist upon it. Demosthenes would never speak extemporarily when he could help it; he was unwilling to put his faculty at the mercy of fortune. Great is the labour of oratory, says Cicero,\n  as is its field, its dignity and its reward. Nor were the audiences less exacting than the speakers were painstaking. The hearers were attentive, not merely to the general drift or to the total effect, but to the particular elegance. Isokrates speaks of the antitheses, the symmetrical clauses and other figures which lend brilliancy to oratorical displays, compelling the listeners to give clamorous applause ).  Sentences, not especially striking or important in relation to the ideas which they convey, are praised by the ancient critics for their artistic excellence.  Further, when an orator, or a master of oratorical prose, wished to publish what we should now call a pamphlet, the form which he chose for it, as most likely to be effective, was that, not of an essay, but of a speech purporting to be delivered in certain circumstances which he imagined. Such are the  the  and the  of Isokrates in the Deliberative form, and his speech  in the Forensic. Such again is the\n famous Second Philippic of Cicero. Then we know  that orators compiled, for their own use, collections of exordia or of commonplaces, to be used as occasion might serve. Such was that  of Cicero's which betrayed him into a mistake which he has chronicled. He had sent Atticus his treatise De Gloria with the wrong exordium prefixed to itone, namely, which he had already prefixed to the Third Book of the Academics. On discovering his mistake, he sends Atticus a new exordium, begging him to cut out the other, and substitute this. Lastly, the ancient critics habitually compare the  pains needful to produce a good speech with the pains needful to produce a good statue or picture. When Plato wishes to describe the finished smoothness of Lysias, he borrows his image from the sculptor, and says . Theon says:Even as for him who would be a painter, it is unavailing to observe the works of Apelles and Protogenes and Antiphilos, unless he tries to paint with his own hand, so for him who would become a speaker there is no help in the speeches of the ancients, or in the copiousness of their thoughts, or in the purity of their diction, or in their harmonious composition, no, nor in lectures upon elegance, unless he disciplines himself by  from day to day. Lucilius, from\n whom Cicero borrows the simile, compares the phrases,  each fitted with nicety to its setting in a finished sentence, with the pieces,  laid in a mosaic. But among the passages, and they are innumerable, which express this view there is one in Dionysios that can never be too attentively  considered by those who wish to understand the real nature of ancient, and especially of Attic, oratory. He is explaining and defendingpartly with a polemical purpose at which we shall have to glance by and bythat minute and incessant diligence which Demosthenes devoted to the perfecting of his orations. It is not strange, says the critic, if a man who has won more glory for eloquence than any of those that were renowned before him, who is shaping works for all the future, who is offering himself to the scrutiny of all-testing Envy and Time, adopts no thought, no word, at random, but takes much care of both things, the arrangement of his ideas and the graciousness of his language: seeing, too, that the men of that day produced discourses which resembled no common scribblings, but rather were like to carved and chiselled forms, I mean Isokrates and Plato, the Sophists. For Isokrates spent on the  to take the lowest traditional estimate, ten years; and Plato ceased not to smooth the locks, and adjust the\n tresses, or vary the braids, of his comely creations, even till he was eighty years old. All lovers of literature are familiar, I suppose, with the stories of Plato's industry, especially the story about the tablet which, they say, was found after his death, with the first words of the arranged in several different orders. What wonder, then, if Demosthenes also took pains to achieve euphony and harmony, and to avoid employing a single word, or a single thought, which he had not weighed? . Repeating this passage, slightly altered, in the essay on Demosthenes, Dionysios adds that we might indeed marvel if, while sculptors and painters are thus conscientious, the artist in civil eloquence () neglected the smallest aids to speaking well."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "7", "head": "This conception is originally Greek.", "p": {"pb": [{"@n": "lxxviii"}, {"@n": "lxxix"}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Its basis the idealisation of man."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "cit": {"quote": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pro\\s de\\ tou/tois a)/topon ei) tw=| sw/mati me\\n ai)sxro\\n mh\\ du/nasqai bohqei=n e(autw=|, lo/gw| d' ou)k ai)sxro/n: o(\\ ma=llon i)/dio/n e)stin a)nqrw/pou th=s tou= sw/matos xrei/as,"}, "bibl": {"@n": "Aristot.

Now, , speech, was recognised by the Greeks as the distinctive attribute of man. It was necessary, therefore, that, at this stage, they should require in speech a clear-cut and typical beauty analogous to that of the idealised human form. This was the central and primary motive, relatively to which all others were subsidiary or accidental.  But, of these secondary motives, two at least  demand a passing notice. First, the oral tradition of poetry and the habit of listening to poetical recitation furnished an analogy which was present to people's minds when they saw a man get up to make a set speech; they expected his words to have something like the coherence, something like the plastic outline, something even like the music of the verses which they were wont to hear flow from the lips of  his counterpart, the rhapsode. Secondly, in the Greek cities, and especially at Athens, public speaking had, by 450 B. C., become so enormously important, opened so much to ambition, constituted a safeguard so essential for security of property and person, that not only was there the most various\n inducement to cultivate it, but it was positively dangerous to neglect it.

The first thing that strikes one is how completely modern life has redressed the complaint made by the earliest philosophical theorist of rhetoric. Aristotle opens his treatise with the  observation that, whereas there are three instruments of rhetorical persuasionthe ethical, the pathetic and the logicalhis predecessors have paid by far the most attention to the second, and have almost totally neglected the third, though this third is incomparably the most important,indeed, the only one of the three which is truly scientific. The logical proof is the very body, , of rhetorical persuasion,everything else, appeal to feeling, attractive portrayal of character, and so forth, is, from the scientific point of view, only , appendage. This is essentially  the modern, especially the modern Teutonic, theory of oratory, and the modern practice is in harmony with it. The broadest characteristic of modern oratory,  as compared with ancient, is the predominance of a sustained appeal to the understanding. Hume,\n with general truth, declares the attributes of Greek oratory to be rapid harmony, exactly adjusted to the sense, vehement reasoning, without any appearance of art, disdain, anger, boldness, freedom, involved in a continual stream of argumenta description, it must be observed, which should at all events be limited to the deliberative and forensic orators contemporary with Demosthenes. Brougham, however, states the case both more accurately and in terms of wider application, when he observes that in ancient oratory there are scarcely any long chains of elaborate reasoning; what was wanted to move, to rouse, and to please the hearers, was rather a copious stream of plain, intelligible observations upon their interests, appeals to their feelings, reminiscences from the history, especially the recent history, of their city, expositions of the evils to be apprehended from inaction or from impolicy, vindications of the orator's own conduct, demonstrations of the folly which disobeys, or of the malice which assails him. Aristotle himself, it may be observed, the very champion of the enthymeme, is the strongest witness to the truth of this. He impresses upon the student of Rhetoric that a speaker must ever remember that he is addressing the vulgar; he must not expect them to be capable of a far-reaching ratiocination, he must not string syllogism to syllogism, he must administer his logic temperately and discreetly. Now, in contrast with this, long and elaborate chains of reasoning,\n or expositions of complicated facts, have been the very essence of the great efforts and triumphs of modern oratory; the imagery and the pathos heighten the effect, but would go only a very little way if the understandings of the hearers had not, in the first place, been convinced. We are here again reminded of the basis on which ancient oratory rested. The  modern speaker comes before his audience with no  claim to be regarded as an artist whose display of his art may be commendable and interesting in itself. Cicero's speech for Archias, which is  exquisitely composed, but of which not more than one-sixth is to the purpose, or his speech for Publius Sextus, in which the relevant part bears a yet smaller proportion to the whole, could not have been delivered in a British court of justice. There is usually, however, an important difference, which will be noticed by and by, between the nature of Greek and that of Roman irrelevance. On the other hand, the modern exaction of consecutive and intelligible reasoning becomes, of course, less severe the more nearly the discourse approaches to the nature of a display. Still, this logical vigilance, with a comparative indifference to form, is, on the whole, the first great characteristic of modern oratory, and has, of course, become more pronounced since the system of reporting for the Press has been perfected, as it is  now, in many cases, far more important for the speaker to convince readers than to fascinate hearers. The characteristic which comes next in degree of significance for our present object is the habitual\n  presumption that the speech is extemporary. Even where there has been the most laborious preparation, even where the fact of such preparation is notorious, it is generally felt to be essential to impressiveness that the fact of  premeditation should be kept out of sight, and on the part of the hearers it is considered more courteous to ignore it. A certain ridicule attaches to a speech which, not having been delivered, is published,the sense of something ludicrous arising partly from the feeling, What an absurd disappointment, but also from the feeling, Here are the bursts which would have  electrified the audience. One thing which has helped to establish this feeling is the frequent failure of those who have attempted verbal premeditation; a failure probably due less often to defective memory or nerve than to neglect of a department in which the ancient orators were most diligent, and in which, moreover, they were greatly assisted by the plastic forms among which they lived, by the share of musical training which they ordinarily possessed, and by the draping of the himation or the togadelivery, in respect both of voice and of action. When a premeditated speech is rendered lifeless or ludicrous by the manner in which it is pronounced, the modern mind at once recurs to its prejudice against Rhetoricthat is, against the Rhetoric of the later schoolsand a contempt is generated for those who deign to labour beforehand on words that should come straight from the heart. There  is, however, a much deeper cause than this for the populai modern notion that the greatest oratory\n must be extemporary, and it is one which, for the modern world, is analogous to the origin of the Greek requirement that speech should be artistic. This cause is the Hebraic basis of education in modern Christendom, especially in those countries which have been most influenced by the Reformation. It becomes a prepossession that the true adviser, the true warner, in all the gravest situations, on all the most momentous subjects, is one to whom it will in that hour be given what he shall speak, and whose inspiration, when it is loftiest, must be communicated to him at the moment by a Power external to himself. The ancient world compared the orator with the poet. The modern world compares the orator with the prophet."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "9", "head": "Modern approximations to the theory of Ancient Oratory.", "p": [{"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Influence of Debate"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Finished Rhetorical Prose:"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Canning's Plymouth speech."}], "pb": {"@n": "lxxxiv"}, "#text": "It is true, indeed, that the ancient theory has often been partially applied in modern times, sometimes with great industry and with much success; but modern conditions place necessary limits to the application, and the great difference is this:The ancients required the speech to be an artistic whole; the modern orator who composes, or verbally premeditates, trusts chiefly, as a rule, to particular passages and is less solicitous for a total symmetry. Debate, in our sense, is a modern institution; its  unforeseen exigencies claim a large margin in the most careful premeditation; and hence, in the principal field of oratory, an insurmountable barrier is at once placed to any real assimilation between the ancient and the modern modes. Just so much the more, if only for contrast, is it interesting to contemplate those modern orators who have approximated\n to the classical theory in such measure as their genius and their opportunities allowed. In an inquiry of the present scope, it might be presumptuous to select living illustrations of the Pulpit, the Senate, or the Bar.

In the combination of argumentative power with lofty earnestness and with eloquence of the Hebraic type, none have surpassed, or perhaps equalled, those divines whose discourses are among the chief glories of the English language.

It was for such bursts that the eloquence of the elder Pitt was famous; that of Mirabeau, and of Patrick Henry, owed its highest renown to the same cause. Sheil's retort, in the debate on the Irish Municipal Bill in 1837, to Lord Lyndhurst's description of the Irish (in a phrase borrowed from O'Connell), as aliens in blood, language and religion, was of this kind. Erskine, in his defence of Lord George\n Gordon, produced an astonishing effect by a protestation,which would have been violent if it had not been solemn,of personal belief in his client's innocence; a daring transgression of the advocate's province which was paralleled, with some momentary success, in a celebrated criminal case about twenty years ago. Now these sudden bursts, and the shock or the transport which they may cause, were forbidden to ancient oratory by the principal law of its being. In nothing is the contrast more striking than in this that the greatest oratorical reputations of the ancient world were chiefly made, and those of the modern world have sometimes been endangered, by prepared works of art. Perikles and Hypereides were renowned for no efforts of their eloquence more than for their funeral orations. Fox's carefully composed speech in honour of the Duke of Bedford, Chatham's elaborate eulogy of Wolfe, were accounted among the least happy of their respective performances. There is, however, at least one instrument of  sudden effect which Greek oratory and British Parliamentary oratory once had in common, but which the latter has now almost abandonedpoetical quotation. A quotation may, of course, be highly effective even for those to whom it is new. But the genuine oratorical force of quotation depends on the hearers knowing the context, having previous associations with the passage, and thus feeling the whole felicity of the application as, at the instant, it is flashed upon the mind. In this respect, the opportunities of the Greek orator were perfect. His hearers were universally and thoroughly familiar with the great\n poets. When Aeschines applies the lines from Hesiod to Demosthenes, it is as if Digby, addressing Puritans, had attempted to sum up Strafford in a verse of Isaiah. In the days when all educated Englishmen knew a good deal of Virgil and Horace, and something of the best English poets, quotation was not merely a keen, but, in skilful hands, a really powerful weapon of parliamentary debate; and its almost total disuse, however unavoidable, is perhaps a more serious deduction than is generally perceived from the rather slender resources of modern English oratory for creating a glow. Pitt's speech on the Slave Trade concluded with the expression of this hopethat Africa, though last of all the quarters of the globe, shall enjoy at length, in the evening of her days, those blessings which have descended so plentifully upon us in a much earlier period of the world: the first beams of the rising sun were just entering the windows of the House, and he looked upward as he said"}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "11", "head": "Special characteristics of Greek oratory", "p": [{"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "all Greek art hus the plastic character."}, "#text": "Hitherto we have been seeking to bring into relief, against the modern conception, that character which is common to Greek and to Roman oratory.

But it is certain that  comparatively few understand the real meaning of plastic, sculpturesque, in these relations; and that to a vast majority of even cultivated persons, the statement of this affinity conveys an altogether erroneous notion. The reason of this is that the place held in antiquity by Sculpture is now held jointly by Painting, Music and certain forms of Poetry; that the modern mind instinctively refers the sculptural to the standard of the picturesque; and that, consequently, while the positive and essential characteristics of Sculpture are lost sight of, its negative qualities, relatively to Painting, become most prominent. These are, the absence of colour and the exclusion of tumultuous or complex action. Hence to the popular modern conception of Sculpture there usually attaches the notion of coldness and of rigidity. When people are told that Greek Tragedy (for example) is sculpturesque, they form this idea of itthat it has grandeur, but that it is cold and rather stiff. Then, if they are convinced that somehow the Greeks really were a race with the very highest genius for art, they begin to feel a secret wish that this alleged analogy between Greek Tragedy and sculpture might turn out to be a mistake.

This will be best understood by a comparison with two other characters of thought; that which has belonged, though in a multitude of special shapes, to the East, and that of medival Europe. Oriental thought, as interpreted by Oriental\n art, fails to define humanity or to give a clear-cut  form to any material which the senses offer to it. Life is conceived only generally, as pervading men, animals and vegetables, but the distinctive attributes of human life, physical or spiritual, are not pondered or appreciated. The human form, the human soul, are not, to this Eastern thought, the objects of an absorbing and analysing contemplation. To European  medivalism, they are so; but the body is regarded as the prison and the shame of the soul; and medival art expresses the burning eagerness of the soul to escape from this prison to a higher communion. The three marks of medival art are individualism, desire and ecstasy; individualism, since the artist is struggling to interpret a personal intensity, and goes to grotesqueness in the effort; desire, since the perpetual longing of the Church on earth for her Master is the type of the artist's passion; ecstasy, since this passion demands the surrender of reason and has its climax in the adoration of a mystery revealed. Between the Oriental and the Medival art stands the Greek. Greek art defines humanity, the body and the soul of man. But it has not reached the medival point; it has not learned to feel that the body is the prison and the shame of the soul. Rather, it regards the soul as reflecting its own divinity upon the body. What a piece of work is man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in\n apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! If Hamlet could have stopped there, he would have been a Greek; but he could not, he was sick with a modern distemper, abandonment to the brooding thought  that sapped his will. The Greek of the days when art was supreme could and did stop there; he was Narcissus, standing on the river bank, looking into the deep, clear waters where the mirror of his image shows the soul, too, through the eyes, Narcissus in love with the image that he beholds,but Narcissus as yet master of himself,as yet with a firm foot-hold upon the bank, not as yet possessed by the delirious impulse to plunge into the depths. Here, then, was the first condition for the possibility of a great art. Reflection had taken the right direction, had got far enough, but had not got too far; it was a pause. But, in order that this pause should be joyous, and that the mind should not, from weariness or disappointment, hasten forward, another thing was  necessarythat men and women should be beautiful. By some divine chance, the pause in reflection coincided with the physical perfection of a race; and the result was Greek art."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "12", "head": "Why Greek art became plastic rather than picturesque.", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Series of the arts:"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Architecture:"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Painting, Music, Poetry;"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Sculpture."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "The limit of expression in Sculpture not irksome, but congenial, to the Greek."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "The best soulpture is not cold nor vague."}], "pb": [{"@n": "xcvii"}, {"@n": "xcviii"}], "#text": "Why, however, should this art have expressed itself in Sculpture rather than, for instance, in Painting? Art gives pleasure by form, by colour, by sound, or, as in poetry, by the reminiscence of all these combined with the delight of motion. But the mind has had a history; and the very degree in  which the resources of a particular art are limited or\n ample may give it a special affinity with an earlier or a later stage of the mind. Architecture corresponds  with the phase when man's thoughts about himself are still indistinct; the building may hint, but it cannot express, the artist's personality: Egyptian art has been called a Memnon waiting for the day.   Painting, Music and Poetry are the modern and romantic arts, with a range of expression adequate to every subtlety and intricacy of self-analysis. Between this group and Architecture comes Sculpture, the art  kindred with that phase in the mind's history when man has just attained to recognition of himself and is observing his own typical characteristics of form and spirit with wonder and with joy, but, as yet, without the impulse towards analysis. In all the greatest sculpture there breathes the unshamed and innocent surprise of a child just waked from sleep. But this of itself implies renouncement; the limits  of possible expression in Sculpture are severe. If, then, the Greek was contemplating his own soul as well as his own body, why, it might be asked, had he recourse to a medium of interpretation for which the spiritual subtleties of painting and poetry are impossible? The answer is,Because he was not observing the soul apart from the body, but as one with the body in a godlike union; and because, to him, any expression of spiritual subtleties was not a gain but a loss, if it was effected at the expense of that in which he was absorbedthe contemplation of man as man, in his totality, as the paragon of animals. Sculpture cannot express a complex or refined situation; but its very limitations on that\n side make it the clearest interpretation of a character or a type. The Greek's attention was fixed on the typical, unchanging, divine lineaments of man, as he stood forth under the blue heaven, his outlines clear against the sunlit sea; and, for the Greek's purpose, sculpture was the more fitting just because it  eliminates what is restless or accidental. But he did not mean sculpture to be cold or rigid; he did not mean it to be blank or vague; and assuredly he made it none of these things.

But this is not, as seems sometimes to be imagined, because the Greeks sought to make  Tragedy like Sculpture. It is because that tendency of intellect and feeling, for which Sculpture happened to be a peculiarly apt expression, set its necessary stamp equally on every thing else that the Greek  mind created. In naming this stamp plastic we borrow our term from the arts of modelling; but to conceive the form of Greek Tragedy as derived from Sculpture is like conceiving the Greek language to be derived from Sanskrit. It is true that, in reference  to the history of Greek thought, Tragedy is a later manifestation than Sculpture; the perfect repose is already troubled, an element of conflict has entered, man is in the presence of Nemesis, and the , the law that sin shall entail suffering, is  the theme. But the typical character is not lost; those unchanging attributes which, on the one hand,\n bring man near to the gods or, on the other, mark his brotherhood with the dust and the limits of his mortal destiny are presented in emphatic, untroubled lines; and, when Retributive Justice has done its work, that blitheness out of which the passions rose into a storm returns subdued to the graver and deeper calm that follows a transcendant contemplation. All honour to those sublime voices of Titanic pain or victory that roll, like dirges or paeans, along the spacious music of Aeschylos; all honour to Euripides also, for no one is capable of feeling that Sophokles is supreme who does not feel that Euripides is admirable. Euripides  is a great emotional dramatist; a master of the picturesque; the only Greek, except Aristophanes, who set foot in the charmed woodlands of fancy. That special claim, however, which has in recent times been made for Euripides, and on the strength of which he has by some been preferred to his predecessors, involves a fallacy which it is important to observe, since what is at issue is much more than our judgment on the relative merits of two poets, it is the principle of appreciation relatively to all the best Greek work in every kind. Euripides has been regarded as distinctively  the human. Now if by this were meant only that he is great in dramatising the accidents of life, in portraying the more obvious phenomena of character,\n in exciting compassion for such troubles, or sympathy with such joys, as come home to us all, in establishing between the poet and the spectator not merely a vivid intelligence but something like a personal friendship, then the epithet would be perfectly just. If, howeverand this is the popular notion Euripides is to be called the human poet in contrast with, for instance, Sophokles; if it is meant that Sophokles is comparatively cold, pompous, stiff, while Euripides is in a warm, flexible, fruitful sympathy with humanitythen the epithet involves a confusion of ideas than which nothing could be more fatal.  Euripides is human, but Sophokles is more human; Sophokles is so in the only way in which a Greek could be so, by being more Greek. When the best Greek mind was truest to the law of its own nature, it looked at man and man's life in the manner of Sophoklesfixing its regard on the permanent, divine characteristics of the human type, and not suffering minor accidents or unrulinesses or griefs so to thrust themselves forward as to mar the symmetry of the larger view. True simplicity is not the avoidance, but the control, of detail. In Sophokles, as in great sculpture, a thousand fine touches go to that which, as the greatest living creator in fiction has proved, he can still help to teachthe delineation of  the great primary emotions. Sophokles is the purest type of the Greek intellect at its best. Euripides is a very different thing, a highly gifted son of his day. Rhetorical Dialectic has broken into Tragedy, and the religious basis, the doctrine of Nemesis, has been abandoned in favour of such other interests as the\n poet can devise. Euripides was brilliantly fertile in plots. This is what Aristotle means by , alluding especially to sudden and pathetic reversals of situation; for, before Alexander's time, tragic had already come near to sensational.

Wherein, then, does it manifest this character? We must here be on our guard against the great stumblingblock of such inquiries, the attempt to find the analogy in the particulars and not in the whole. It might be possible to take a speech of Demosthenes and to work out the details of a correspondence with a tragedy of Sophokles or a work of Pheidias; but such refinements have usually a perilous neighbourhood to fantasy, and, even when they are legitimate, are apt to be more curious than instructive. How truly and universally Greek Oratory bears the plastic stamp, can be seen only when it is regarded in its largest aspects. The\n  first point to be observed is that, in Greek Oratory, we have a series of types developed by a series of artists, each of whom seeks to give to his own type the utmost clearness and distinction that he is capable of reaching. The same thing is true of Tragedy, but not in the same degree; for, in Tragedy, the element of consecrated convention was more persistent; and, besides, Oratory stood in such manifold and intimate relations with the practical life that the artist, in expressing his oratorical theory, could express his entire civic personality. Hence the men who moulded Attic Oratory, whether statesmen or not, are good examples of conscious obedience to that law of Greek nature which constrained every man to make himself a living work of art. In its poets and orators, says Hegel, its historians and philosophers, Greece cannot be conceived from a central point unless one brings, as a key to the understanding of it, an insight into the ideal forms of sculpture, and regards the images of statesmen and philosophers as well as epic and dramatic heroes from the artistic point of view; for those who act, as well as those who create and think, have, in those beautiful days of Greece, this plastic character. They are great and free, and have grown up on the soil of their own individuality, creating themselves out of themselves, and moulding themselves to what they were and willed to be. The age of Perikles was rich in such characters: Perikles himself, Pheidias, Plato, above all Sophokles, Thucydides also, Xenophon and Sokrates, each in his own order, without the perfection\n of one being diminished by that of the others.

First, however little  of sustained reasoning there may be, however much the argument may be mingled with appeals, reminiscences or invectives, everything bears on the matter in hand. It is an exertion of art, but of art strictly pertinent to its scope. No Greek orator could have written such a speech as that of Cicero For Archias or For Publius Sextus. In a Greek speech the main lines of the subject are ever firm; they are never lost amid the flowers of a picturesque luxuriance. Secondly, wherever pity, terror, anger,  or any passionate feeling is uttered or invited, this tumult is resolved in a final calm; and where such tumult has place in the peroration, it subsides before the last sentences of all. The ending of the speech On the Crownwhich will be noticed hereafteris exceptional and unique. As a rule, the very end is calm; not so much because the speaker feels this to be necessary if he is to leave an impression of personal dignity, but rather because the sense of an ideal\n beauty in humanity and in human speech governs his effort as a whole, and makes him desire that, where this effort is most distinctly viewed as a whole namely, at the closeit should have the serenity  of a completed harmony.

Unquestionably, the scale of life in the Greek republics, and the dialect of the aristocracy at Rome, often imparted to the mutual criticisms of their orators a parochial character which is comparatively rare in the public discussions of the present day.

Now, it is altogether otherwise with the Greek masters; changing a few phrases, which the difference of religion and of manners might render objectionable,moderating, in some degree, the virulence of invective, especially against private character, to suit the chivalrous courtesy of modern hostility,there is hardly one of the political or forensic orations of the Greeks that might not be delivered in similar circumstances before our senate or tribunals."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Reasons of this superiority: Greek oratory is always to the point:"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "the political inspirations of Greek oratory are nobler:"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "title": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "De sexto consulatu Honorii Augusti"}, "#text": "(404 A.D.) v. 150."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "and the forensic motive is more genuine."}], "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "vitae Romana quies"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "plus curae,"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "plus naturae,"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "patronus,"}], "bibl": {"@n": "Quint.

If everything is not logical, everything is at least relevant. Cicero, with all his ingenuity, brilliancy and wit, is so apt to wander into mere display, and this display is so openly artificial, that, as Brougham says, nothing can be less adapted to the genius of modern elocution. The style of modern debate comes far nearer to the Greek than to the Latin. But there are two other causes which should be remarked, one especially influential in Deliberative, the other in Forensic, oratory. The first is that, in the days of  the great Roman eloquence, Rome had no political rival. Her discipline and her manners contributed with her civic security to exempt her citizens from sudden or violent emotion. What Claudian afterwards happily called the  already prevailed. If the paradox of Quintilian () be true, that Demosthenes has  Cicero  it is true in this sense alone, that Cicero is an inferior artist, and indulges more freely the taste of the natural man for ornament. But that Roman oratory should be on the whole more artificial than the Greek, and more limited in its range of subjects, was inevitable. Athens, the antagonist of Sparta or\n Thebes, Athens vigilant against Persia or threatened by Macedon, was a city in which the inspirations of eloquence were not only personal but national.  Secondly: the Roman  who pleaded his client's cause gratuitously, rewarded by the fact that all the higher paths of ambition opened directly from the forum, had, doubtless, an incentive to eloquent declamation which his Attic brother, the professional  did not possess. But he had not anything like the same inducement to handle his case scientifically. He was a political aspirant, not a man settled to a calling; and, from a forensic point of view, the element of unreality in his position had a strong tendency to vitiate his performance by making it, before all things, a display."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "17", "head": "Early History of Greek Oratory.", "p": [{"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Two conditions for the possibility of any such history."}, "#text": "The least gifted people, in the earliest stage of intellectual or political growth, will always or usually have the idea, however rude, of a natural  oratory.

On the other hand,  no documents of any early society can show an exuberance, a brilliancy, a diversified perfection of natural eloquence comparable to that which makes one of the chief glories of the Homeric poems. By natural is meant, not necessarily unstudied, but unsystematic, or antecedent to a theory of Rhetoric. The man to whom the gods had given  , the power of discourse,that which, with beautiful strength, , and good sense, , makes the Homeric triad of human excellences, might cultivate it; but so long as this cultivation is empirical, not theoretic, the eloquence which it achieves is still natural. From Achilles to Thersites, the orators of the Iliad and the Odyssey are  individual. If Achilles alone is a Demosthenes, who had no defects to conquer and no mysteries to learn, Nestor is an Isokrates unaided or unembarrassed by his system, Telemachos an ingenuous youth who has no need of prompting by a Lysias, Odysseus a speaker in whom the logical terseness of Isaeos is joined to something like the unscrupulous smartness, though to nothing like the theatrical splendour, of  Aeschines. Nor does any oratory that the ancient world has left approach so nearly as the Homeric to\n the modern ideal. The reason of this is that the great orations of the Iliad are made in debate, and the greatest of all are replies,as the answer of Achilles to the envoys in the First Book. Condensed statement, lucid argument, repartee, sarcasm, irony, overwhelming invective, profound and irresistible pathos,all these resources are absolutely commanded by the orators of the Iliad, and all these must have belonged to him, or to those, by whom  the Iliad was created. As Mr Gladstone has said, Paradise Lost does not represent the time of Charles the Second, nor the Excursion the first decades of this century, but as, when we find these speeches in Homer, we know that there must have been men who could speak them, so, from the existence of units who could speak them, we know that there must have been crowds who could feel them."}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "tis"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "i)shgori/a"}], "pb": {"@n": "cxi"}, "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "i)shgori/a"}, "#text": "First conditions of civil eloquence  ,"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "and popular culture."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "The faculty of speech its place in early Greek Democracy."}], "#text": "The Homeric ideal, to shine in eloquence as in action, to be at once a speaker of words and a doer of deeds, good in counsel, and mighty in war, had ample scope, as far as kings and nobles were concerned, in the council and the agora. But the eloquence of the commons does not appear to have been particularly encouraged by the chiefs, and the consummate individuality of an Achilles or an Odysseus was no real step towards the development of a popular oratory based upon a theory communicable to all. In the presence of these great debaters of the Iliad, the Homeric , when present at all, is essentially a layman, confined strictly to the critical function and uttering his criticisms, when\n they find utterance, in the fewest and plainest words. Democracy, with its principle of ,  the principle that every citizen has an equal right to speak his mind about the concerns of the city, was necessary before a truly civil eloquence could be even possible. But, after Democracy had arisen, a further condition was needed,the cultivation of  the popular intelligence. What is so strikingly characteristic of Greek Democracy in the period  before an artistic oratory is this,that the power of public speaking now exists, indeed, as a political weapon, but, instead of being the great organ by which the people wield the commonwealth, is constantly used by designing individuals against the people. It is employed as a lever for changing the democracy into a tyranny. Such names as Aristagoras, Evagoras, Protagoras, Peisistratos, frequent especially in the Ionian colonies, indicate, not the growth of a popular oratory, but the ascendancy which exceptionally gifted speakers were able to acquire, especially in democracies, before oratory was yet an accomplishment studied according to a method."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "18", "head": "The intellectual turning-point first conception of a literary Prose.", "p": {"pb": {"@n": "cxii"}, "quote": {"@lang": "en", "lg": {"@type": "ia5", "l": ["The riddling Sphinx put dim things from our minds,", "And set us to the questions at our doors."]}}, "#text": "The intellectual turning-point came when Poetry ceased to have a sway of which the exclusiveness rested on the presumption that no thought can be expressed artistically which is not expressed metrically.

The first cause was the general character of the Sicilian Greeks. Thucydides remarks that the quick and adventurous  Athenians, who were often benefited by Lacedaemonian slowness or caution, found most formidable adversaries in the Syracusans just because the Syracusans were so like themselves; and this resemblance, we have good reason to suppose, included the taste for lively controversy and the passion for lawsuits described by Aristophanes in the  An acute people, with an inborn love of disputation, is the description of the Sicilians which Cicero quotes from Aristotle (): Sicilians are never so miserable, he says in one of the Verrine speeches, that they cannot make a happy joke. The  population thus gifted had, further, gone through the same political phases as Athens; through aristocracy they had arrived at tyranny, and through tyranny at a democracy. The flourishing age of the Sicilian  Tyrantsthe early part of the fifth century B. C. was illustrated by art and literature, by the lyric poetry which, native to Ionia, found its most splendid theme in the glory of these Dorian princes of the West, and by a home-growth of Comedy, the creation of Phormis and Epicharmos. It was in 466 \n that Thrasybulos, last of the Gelonian dynasty, was expelled and that a democracy was established at Syracuse. Somewhat later, a democracy arose at  Agrigentum also. Popular life was now as exuberant in Sicily as it was at Athens after the Persian Wars; but, with its mixture of races, it was less fortunately tempered; its vigour, instead of glowing with the sense of national welfare secured against aliens, had the feverish vehemence of a domestic reaction; and hence we should be prepared to find these younger democracies showing almost at once some features which do not appear in the elder Athenian democracy until the time of the Peloponnesian War. But it was neither by the turbulent rivalries of the popular assembly, nor by  the natural growth of  or pettifogging, that the formulation of Rhetoric as an Art was immediately caused. The absolute princes of Sicily had done as they listed. They had banished, they  had confiscated,like Dionysios I. in later times, they had effaced towns and transferred populations, they had turned all things upside-down. When they were driven out, and when governments arose based on the equality of citizens before the law, a  crowd of aggrieved claimants presented themselves wherever that law had a seat. Ten years ago, this one would say, Hieron banished me from Syracuse because I was too much a democrat, and gave my house on the Epipolae to Agathokles, who still lives among you; I ask the people to restore it to me. When Gelon razed our city, another would say, and divided the lands among\n his friends, we were commanded to dwell at Selinus, where I have lived many years; my father's land was given to a favourite of the tyrant's, whose first cousin still holds it; I ask you to insist on this man making restitution. Claims of this kind would be innumerable. And, besides those which were founded in justice, a vast number of false claims would be encouraged by the general presumption that the rights of property had been universally deranged. If, twenty years after the Cromwellian Settlement of Ireland, a government had arisen of such a nature as to make it worth people's while to dispute every possession taken under that settlement in the Ten Counties, the state of things which would have ensued would have borne some resemblance to that which prevailed throughout Sicily, but especially at Syracuse, in 466 B.C."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "General features of such claims."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Best aids for such claimants:"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "1.

This is not, however, because the portrait of him in Plato is so vivid. Nothing more distinguishes Plato from later satirists of like keenness than his manner of hinting the redeeming points of the person under dissection; and, whenever Gorgias comes inwhether in the dialogue that bears his name or elsewhereit may be discerned (I venture to think) that Plato's purpose was to bring out an aspect of the manthat aspect which he considered most importantbut that he allowed, and was writing for those who knew, that there was another side to the picture.\n This other side is suggested by the fact that Gorgias had at least some influence on a man of such intellectual power as Thucydides, on one so highly cultivated as the tragic poet Agathon, and on so shrewd a judge of practical ability as Jason of Pherae. The difficulty of now estimating Gorgias comes from this,that he was an inventor whose originality it is hard for us to realise, but an artist whose faults are to us peculiarly glaring. Gorgias of Leontini was born about 485 B. C. Tradition made him the pupil of Empedokles; but their nearness in age makes this unlikely. That they knew each other is probable enough. Gorgias, like Protagoras, began with natural philosophy; and, after employing Eleatic methods to combat Eleatic conclusions, turned from a field of which he held himself to have  proved the barrenness. The practical culture to which he next addressed himself differed both from that of the Eastern Sophists and from that of the Sicilian Rhetors. It was founded neither upon  Dialectic nor upon a systematic Rhetoric. Its basis was Oratory considered as a faculty to be developed empirically. Whether Gorgias left a written Art or not, is doubtful; it seems more probable that he did not; and his method of teachingwhich reappears a century and a half later with the beginnings of Asianismrested on the commission to memory of prepared passages. These passages were especially such as might serve to magnify the speaker's theme () or to bring out the enormity of a wrong (). Beautiful and effective expression ()\n was the one great object. Gorgias seems to have given little or no heed to the treatment of subjectmatter,to invention or management; or even to that special topic of Probability which was already engaging so much of the attention of Rhetoric. He was himself a man with a brilliant gift for language. His general conception was simple enough, but, for his own day and world, both bold and original. If the faculty of expression is cultivated to the right point, and is combined with a certain amount of general information, it will carry all before it. Just in the spirit in which Vivian Grey is described as saying to himself knowledge is power, Gorgias said to himself, expression is power. He considered the gift in its relation to victory, and this victory not to be such narrow and painful success as was prepared by the pedantries of the rhetors, but dazzling and world-wide. Everything recorded of the man suggests his immense self-confidence, his capacity for sustained work, his exuberant vitality, and, above all, his power of doing what a new style would not have done without other giftssetting the fashion to the ambitious among the rising generation, or even exciting a popular enthusiasm. In  427 B. C. the Leontines sent an embassy to Athens, praying for help in their war with Syracuse. At the head of the envoys, says Diodoros, was Gorgias the rhetor, a man who far surpassed all his\n contemporaries in oratorical force. He astonished the Athenians, with their quick minds and their  love of eloquence, by the foreign fashion () of his languageand by figures which the historian proceeds to enumerate. Now Gorgias appears to have always spoken and written in the Attic dialectnot in the ordinary Sicilian Doric, nor in the Ionic of Leontini. The  of Diodoros is that foreign air which Aristotle in his Rhetoric calls , and which, for Athenians at least, was capable, when rightly used, of being a charm in oratory. There is no word which will exactly translate it, but it is nearly akin to what we mean by distinction. That which was, to the Athenians, , or the element of distinction,  in the Sicilian's speaking, was its poetical character; and this depended on two thingsthe use of poetical words, and the use of symmetry or assonance between clauses in such a way as to give a strongly marked prose-rhythm and to reproduce, as far as possible, the metres of verse. The only considerable fragment of Gorgias extant is that from the Funeral Orationfor the  and the  are now generally admitted to be later imitations.

It is more difficult still, perhaps, to realize that the invention of this style was a proof of genius. Gorgias was the first man who definitely conceived how literary prose might be artistic. That he should instinctively compare it with the only other form of literature which was already artistic, namely poetry, was inevitable. Early prose necessarily begins by comparing itself with poetry. Gorgias was a man of glowing and eager power; he carried the assimilation to a length which seems incredibly tasteless now. But let it be remembered that the interval between Gorgias and Thucydides, in some passages of the historian's speeches, is not so very wide. And if the enthusiasm of the Ekklesia still seems incomprehensible, let it be remembered that they felt vividly the whole originality of the man, and did not at all see that his particular tendency was mistaken. It was only by and by, and after several compromises, that men found out\n the difference between  and , between verse and rhythmical prose; namely, that rhythm is the framework of the former but only the fluent outline of the latter. If a style is new and forcible, extravagances will not hinder it from being received with immense applause at its first appearance. Then it is imitated until its originality is forgotten and its defects brought into relief. In the maturity of his genius, Lord Macaulay pronounced the Essay on Milton to be disfigured by much gaudy and ungraceful ornament. Gorgias was the founder of artistic prose; and his faults are the more excusable because they were extravagant. Granting the natural assumption that prose was to be a kind of poetry, then Gorgias was brilliantly logical; and, as the event proved, his excesses did good service by calling earlier attention to the fallacy in his theory."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "26", "head": "Perikles", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Was his oratory artistic in form?"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*periklh=s"}, "quote": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "r(h/twr kai\\ dhmagwgo/s, o(/stis prw=tos grapto\\n lo/gon e)n dikasthri/w| ei)=pe, tw=n pro\\ au)tou= sxediazo/ntwn"}, "#text": "Suidas s. v. ; ."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "cit": {"bibl": {"@n": "Cic. de Orat. 2.93", "title": "De Orat.", "#text": "Cic.

Suidas says that Perikles was the first who composed a forensic speech before delivering it; his predecessors had extemporised. Cicero says that Perikles and Alkibiades are the most ancient authors who have left authentic writings. Quintilian, however, thinks that the\n compositions extant under the name of Perikles are not worthy of his reputation, and that, as others had conjectured, they were spurious. Plutarch says  positively that Perikles has left nothing written () except decrees. The antithesis meant by  is with those sayings of Perikles which tradition had preserved; especially those bold similes from nature and life to which reference will be made in considering the style of Antiphon. The speeches  in Thucydides doubtless give the general ideas of Perikles with essential fidelity; it is possible, further, that they may contain recorded sayings of his like those in Aristotle: but it is certain that they cannot be taken as giving the form of the statesman's oratory. Like the other speeches, they bear the stamp of a manner which was not so fully developed until after his death. Perikles as an orator is best  known to us from the brief but emphatic notices of the impression which he made. This man, says Eupolis, whenever he came forward, proved himself the greatest orator among men: like a good runner, he could give the other speakers ten feet start, and win.......Rapid you call him; but, besides his swiftness, a certain persuasion sat upon his lips such was his spell: and, alone of the speakers,\n he ever left his sting in the hearers. When Aristophanes is describing the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, Perikles the Olympian, he says, was thundering and lightening and putting Greece in a  tumult. ()  Unique as an Athenian statesman, Perikles must have been in two respects unique also as an Athenian orator;first, because he occupied such a position of personal ascendancy as no man before or after him attained; secondly, because his thoughts and his moral force won him such renown for eloquence as no one else ever got from Athenians without the further aid of artistic expression.

The chief importance of Grecian history depends on this, that the Greeks are the first people from whom we can learn any lessons in the art of ruling men according to law. While all the nations with which the Greeks came in contact were governed more or less despotically, the Greek cities alone were governed politically. No Persian or Egyptian had any conception of the principle that both sides of a public question should be fairly heard, that it should be decided by the opinion of the civic majority, and that the minority should be bound by this decision. Every Greek city, be it planted where it might, at the Pillars of Herakles or on the shores of the Inhospitable Sea, was perfectly familiar with this doctrine. Sometimes a tyrant forcibly suspended its operation, sometimes an oligarchy capriciously narrowed its scope, but it was known wherever the Greek tongue  was spoken. In democratic Athens, more than in any other Greek city, this doctrine was no speculative opinion, no occasional motive, but the present and perpetual spring of public action; nor did any goddess of the pantheon receive a tribute more fitting or more sincere than that which Athenians  annually laid on the altar of Persuasion. It has\n sometimes been said that Greek Oratory means Athenian Oratory. This is far from being true in the sense that all the considerable masters of oratorical prose were either natives of Attica or permanent residents at Athens. Gorgias of Leontini, Theodoros of Byzantium, Thrasymachos of Chalkedon, Anaximenes of Lampsakos, Naukrates of Erythrae, Philiskos of Miletos, Ephoros of Cumae, Theopompos of Chios, Theodektes of Phaselis, and many more, might be adduced. But there is another sense in which the statement is true. Athens was the home, though Attica was not the birth-place, of all the very greatest men in this branch of art, of all the men whose works had wide and lasting acceptance as canons. Athens was, further, the educator of all those men, whether first-rate or not, who, after about 400 B. C., won a Panhellenic name for eloquence. The relation of Athenian to Greek oratory is accurately stated by Isokrates when, in 353 B. C., he is defending his theory of culture against supposed objectionsobjections which, as the very history of his school shows, had never really taken hold of the Athenian mind, but were restricted to a much narrower circle than his rather morbid sensibility imagined (). You must not forget that our city is regarded as the established teacher of all who can speak or teach others to speak. And naturally so, since men see that our city offers\n the greatest prizes to those who possess this faculty, provides the most numerous and most various schools for those who, having resolved to enter the real contests, desire a preparatory discipline,and, further, affords to all men that experience which is the main secret of success in speaking. Besides, men hold that the general diffusion and the happy temperament of Attic speech, the Attic flexibility of intelligence and taste for letters, contribute not a little to literary culture; and hence they not unjustly deem that all masters of expression are disciples of Athens. See, then, lest it be folly indeed to cast a slur on this name which you have among the Greeks...; that unjust judgment will be nothing else than your open condemnation of yourselves. You will have done as the Lacedaemonians would do if they introduced a penalty for attention to military exercises, or the Thessalians, if they instituted proceedings at law against men who seek to make themselves good riders."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "29", "head": "Political aspect of Athenian Oratory.", "p": {"pb": [{"@n": "cxxxv"}, {"@n": "cxxxvi"}, {"@n": "cxxxvii"}, {"@n": "1"}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Political training of the Greek citizen,"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "and especially of the Athenian."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "title": "Historical Essays", "#text": "Freeman,  (Second Scries), pp. 128 f."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Civic sentiment in the Greek and in the Italian Republics."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Athens and Florence."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "title": "Historical Essays,", "#text": "In the Essay on Ancient Greece and Medival Italy ( Second Series), Mr Freeman has worked out the likeness and unlikeness which here are barely touched on."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The Florentine burgher was qualified for the franchise by belonging to one of the ineorporated arts: Symonds, Renaissance in Italy.

The artistic aspect will necessarily be most prominent in the following pages, since their special object is to trace the development of Attic oratory in relation to the development of Attic prose. When, however, Attic oratory is considered, not relatively to Attic prose, but in itself, the artistic aspect is not more important than the political; and, if even the literary value of the Attic orations is to be fully understood, their political significance must not for a moment be left out of sight. This significance resides not merely in the\n matter or form of each discourse, but also in the  training which had been received by the public to which it is addressed. We must ask ourselves, not merely, Is this subject well treated? but also, What manner of a multitude can it have been for which the speaker thought this treatment adapted? The common life of every Greek city, not suppressed by tyranny or too much warped by oligarchy, was a political education for the citizens. The reason is manifest from the very fact that the society  a city, and neither a village nor a nation. On the one hand there was the instinct which demanded the highest attainable organisation under laws. On the other, there was the inability to conceive parliament except as a primary assembly. At Athens this political education of the citizens  was more thorough than elsewhere, because at Athens the tendency of a commonwealth to deposit all power in an assembly was worked out with most logical completeness. All the powers of the State, legislative, executive and judicial were concentrated in the absolute Demos: the law-courts were committees of the Ekklesia, as the archons or generals were its officers. The world has seen nothing like this. The Italian Republics of the middle age were  fragments of the Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Italy. It was from their prosperity as municipalities that they had derived their independence as States. They grew up among traditions of feudal privilege, represented here and there by a noble who\n could openly violate the order of the city within  whose walls he lived. A Florentine, like an Athenian, was a citizen with his share in the government of the city: Florence, like Athens, recognised the right of the assembled People to decide questions of State. But Florence, until its latest days, had nothing truly corresponding to the Ekklesia. The citizens were occasionally called together, but there was no popular Assembly with an organised and continual superintendence of all affairs. Nor was the civic sentiment so vivid or so direct for the Florentine as for the Athenan. The Florentne acted in politics primarily as member of a commercial guild and only secondarily as a citizen. The Greek Republics far more than the Italian, Athens far more than Florence, afforded the proper atmosphere for such an oratory as alone, in strictness, can take the  lofty name of Civil; that is, which is addressed by a citizen, educated both in ruling and in obeying, to the whole body of fellow-citizens who have had the  same twofold training as himself. The glory of Attic oratory, as such, consists not solely in its intrinsic excellence, but also in its revelation of the corporate political intelligence to which it appealed: for it spoke sometimes to an Assembly debating an issue of peace or war, sometimes to a law-court occupied\n with a private plaint, sometimes to Athenians mingled with strangers at a festival, but everywhere and always to the Athenian Demos, everywhere and always to a paramount People, taught by life itself to reason and to judge."}}]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "1", "head": "Antiphon:  Life", "div2": [{"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "head": "Introduction", "p": [{"pb": {"@n": "2"}, "bibl": {"@n": "Thuc. 8.68", "#text": "Thuc.

C., being thus rather younger than Gorgias, and some eight or nine years older than the historian Thucydides. He was of the tribe of Aiantis and of the deme of Rhamnus; of a family which cannot have\n been altogether obscure, since it was made a reproach to him on his trial that his grandfather had been a partisan of the Peisistratidae. The tradition that his father Sophilos was a sophist antedates by a generation the appearance of that class of teachers, and may have been suggested simply by the jingle of the words. Antiphon himself, as the style of his composition indicates, must have felt the sophistic influence; but there is no evidence for his having been the pupil of any particular sophist. He is allowed by general consent to have been the first  representative at Athens of a profession for which the new conditions of the time had just begun to make a place,  the first , or writer of speeches for money. With the recent growth of Rhetoric as a definite art, the inequality, for purposes of pleading or debating, between men who had and who had not mastered the newly-invented weapons of speech had become seriously felt. A rogue skilled in the latest subtleties of argument and graces of style was now more than ever formidable to the plain man whom he chose to drag before a court or to attack in the ekklesia: and those who had no leisure or taste to become rhetoricians now began to find it worth while to buy their rhetoric ready-made. Forensic speeches were, no doubt, those with which Antiphon most frequently supplied his clients. But\n Hermogenes describes him as the inventor and founder of the political style,a phrase including deliberative as well as forensic oratory: and this exactly agrees with the statement of Thucydides that Antiphon was practised in aiding, not only those who had lawsuits, but debaters in the ekklesia. Besides being a speech-writer, he was also a teacher of rhetoric, and, as the allusion in the Menexenos implies, the most fashionable master of Plato's time  at Athens. The tradition that Thucydides was the pupil of Antiphon may have been suggested by the warmth and emphasis of the passage in which the orator is mentioned by the historian; a passage which, in its sudden glow of a personal admiration, recalls two others in the Historythe tribute to the genius of Themistokles, and the character of Perikles. In the tradition itself there is nothing improbable, but it wants the support of evidence.

The oppression of the subject-allies by the demagogues, who extorted from them large sums on any pretence or threat, was a commonplace of complaint with oligarchs. The employment of Antiphon, afterwards so staunch an oligarch, by aggrieved allies, preparing to represent their grievances at the imperial city, was perhaps more than an accident of professional routine. The hostility of Antiphon to Alkibiades, again, need not have had any political\n meaning; but it would have been especially natural in one who had shared the views, and who mourned the fate, of Nikias. At all events, the words of Thucydides give a vivid idea of the position held at Athens by Antiphon just before the Revolution of the Four Hundred. His abilities were acknowledged, but they were exerted only for others; he himself came forward neither in the assembly, norwhen he could help itin the law-courts; he lay under the suspicion of the people for cleverness. The nature of the cleverness () for which Antiphon was distrusted and disliked is sufficiently illustrated by his Tetralogies. It was the art of fighting a cause which could hardly be defended on any broad ground by raising in succession a number of more or less fine points. The indignant bewilderment expressed by the imaginary prosecutor in the Second Tetralogy on finding the common-sense view of the case turned upside-down represents what many a citizen of the old school must have felt when he encountered, in the ekklesia or the law-court, a client of the ingenious speech-writer. Antiphon was a cautious, patient man. The comic poets could ridicule him for his poverty or his avarice; they could say that the speeches which he sold for great sums were framed to defeat justice; but a\n carefully obscure life probably offered no hold to any more definite attack.

Alkibiades, by promises of Persian aid, induced the oligarchs in the army at Samos to commence a movement for the overthrow of the Athenian democracy. Peisandros, as their representative, came to Athens, and, by insisting on the hopelessness of the war without such help as Alkibiades covenanted to bring, extorted from the ekklesia a vote for that change of constitution which the exile demanded. Having visited the various oligarchical clubs in the city and urged them to combine in favour of the project, Peisandros went back to confer with Alkibiades. When he presently returned to Athens,with the knowledge that his hopes from Persia were idle, but that, on the other hand, the Revolution must go on, he found a state of things very different from that which he had left. He had left the people just conscious that an oligarchy was proposed, and consenting, in sheer despair, to entertain the idea; but, at the same time, openly and strongly averse to it, and in a temper which showed that the real difficulties of the undertaking were to come. He now finds that, in the brief interval of his absence, every difficulty has already vanished. Not a trace of open opposition remains in the senate or in the ekklesia; not a\n murmur is heard in the conversation of the citizens (, ). It is a fair inference from the words of Thucydides that the principal agent in producing this rapid and wonderful change had been Antiphon. A brief consideration of the task which he had to do, and of the manner in which it was done, will supply the best criterion of his capacity. He had, first, to bring into united and disciplined action those oligarchical clubs to which Peisandros had appealed. These are described as leagues with a view to lawsuits and to offices; that is, associations of which the members were pledged by oath to support, personally and with funds, any one of their body who brought, or defended, a civil action, or who sought one of the offices of the State. When, with the steady advance of democracy from the Persian wars onwards, the oligarchs found themselves more and more in a minority, such associations became their means of concentrating and economising their one great powerwealth. The tone of such clubs would always be, in a general way, antipopular. But they were unaccustomed to systematic action for great ends; and, in regard to those smaller ends which they ordinarily pursued, their interests would, from the nature of the case, frequently conflict. Antiphon need not have had much difficulty in proving to them that, on this occasion, they had a common interest. But to make them effective as well as unanimous; to restrain, without discouraging,\n the zeal of novices in a political campaign, and to make of these a compact and temperate force, loyally taking the word from the best men among them, and so executing the prescribed manuvres that in a short time they were completely ascendant over an enormous and hostile, but ill-organised majority,this, assuredly, was the achievement of no ordinary leader. The absence of overt, and the skilful use of secret, violence was the characteristic of the Revolution. Adverse speakers were not menaced, but they disappeared; until apparent unanimity, and real terror, had silenced every objection. Antiphon had seen clearly how the Athenian instinct of reverence for constitutional forms might be used against the constitution. His too, on the showing of Thucydides, must have been that clever invention, the imaginary body of Five Thousand to whom the franchise was to be left; a fiction which, to the end, did service to the oligarchs by giving them a vague prestige for strength."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "5", "head": "The two parties in the Council.", "p": [{"pb": {"@n": "10"}, "#text": "The Council of the Four Hundred comprised two distinct elements,  those thorough oligarchs who had been the core of the conspiracy; and a number of other men, more or less indifferent to the ideas of oligarchy, who had accepted the Revolution because they believed that it alone could save Athens.

But the resolute hostility of the army, which at once\n made the case of the Four Hundred really hopeless, brought the discord to light forthwith. The Council was thenceforth divided into an Extreme and a Moderate party. Among the leaders of the Extreme party were Peisandros, Phrynichos, Aristarchos, Archeptolemos, Onomakles and Antiphon. The Moderates were led by Theramenes and Aristokrates. Two chief questions were in dispute between the parties. The Moderates wished to call into political life the nominal civic body of Five Thousand; the ultra-oligarchs objected that it was better, at such a crisis, to avoid all chance of a popular rising.

Before that age no Greek had conceived artistic composition except in the form of poetry. The Ionians who had already recorded myths or stated philosophies in prose had either made no effort to rise above the ease of daily talk, or had clothed their meaning in a poetical diction of the most ambitious kind. As the mental horizon of Greece was widened, as subtler ideas and more various combinations began to ask for closer and more flexible expression, the desire grew for\n something more precise than poetry, firmer and more compact than the idiom of conversation. Two special causes aided this general tendency. The development of democratic life, making the faculty of speech before popular assemblies and popular lawcourts a necessity, hastened the formation of an oratorical prose. The Persian Wars, by changing Hellenic unity from a sentiment into a fact, and reminding men that there was a corporate life, higher and grander than that of the individual city, of which the story might be told, supplied a new motive to historical prose. Athens under Perikles became the focus of all the feelings which demanded this new utterance, and of all the capabilities which could make the utterance artistic. The Athenian mind, with its vigour, its sense of measure, its desire for clearness, was fitted to achieve the special excellences of prose, and moulded that Attic dialect in which the prose-writer at last found his most perfect instrument. But the process of maturing the new kind of composition was necessarily slow; for it required, as its first condition, little less than the creation of a new language, of an idiom neither poetical nor mean. Herodotos, at the middle point of the fifth century, shows the poetical element still preponderant. The close of that century may be taken as the end of the first great stage in the growth of a prose literature.

The newly created art has the continual consciousness of being an art. It is always on its guard against sliding into the levity of a conversational style. The composer feels above all things that his written language must be so chosen as to produce a greater effect than would be produced by an equivalent amount of extemporary speaking. Every word is to be pointed and pregnant; every phrase is to be the condensed expression of his thought in its ultimate shape, however difficult this may be to the reader or hearer who meets it in that shape for the first time; the movement of the whole is to be slow and majestic, impressing by its weight and grandeur, not charming by its life and flow. The prose-writer of this epoch instinctively compares himself with the poet. The poet is a craftsman, the possessor of a mystery revealed to the many only in the spell which it exerts over their fancies; just so, in the beginnings of a literary prose, its shaper likes to think that he belongs to a guild. He does not care to be simply right and clear: rather he desires to have the whole advantage which his skill gives him over ordinary men; he is eager to bring his thoughts down upon them with a splendid and irresistible force. In Greece this character, natural to immature prose, was intensified by a special cause the influence of the Sophists. In so far as these teachers dealt with the form of language, they tended to confirm that view of the prose-writer in which he is a professional expert dazzling and overawing laymen. The Sophists of Hellas Proper dwelt especially\n on the minute proprieties of language, as Protagoras on correct grammatical forms and Prodikos on the accurate use of synonyms; the Sophists of Sicily taught its technical graces. In this last respect the teaching of Gorgias was thoroughly reactionary, and was calculated to hinder the growth of a good prose just at the critical point. At the moment when prose was striving to disengage itself from the diction of poetry, Gorgias gave currency to the notion that poetical ornament of the most florid type was its true charm. When, indeed, he went further, and sought to imitate the rhythm as well as the phrase of poetry, this very extravagance had a useful result. Prose has a rhythm, though not of the kind at which Gorgias aimed; and the mere fact of the Greek ear becoming accustomed to look for a certain proportion between the parts of a sentence hastened the transition from the old running style to the periodic."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "4", "head": "Dionysios on the austere style.", "p": [{"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "au)sthra/, glafura/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "koinh\\"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "me/sh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a(rmoni/a"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a(rmoni/ai"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "le/ceis"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a(rmoni/ai"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "le/ceis"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "le/ceis"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)chllagme/nh, peritth\\ le/cis"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "lith/, a)felh\\s le/cis"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "mikth\\ kai\\ su/nqetos le/cis"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "le/cis"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "le/cis"}], "title": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "peri\\ sunq. o)nom."}, "Demosth."], "term": ["composition,", "diction,", "elaborate diction,", "smooth and plain diction,", "mixed diction,"], "#text": "and  (or ) : Dionys.  ec. 22, 23, 24.

He is to his successors generally as Aeschylos to Euripides. The elder tragedy held its gods and heroes above the level of men by a colossal majesty of repose, by the passionless utterance of kingly thoughts; and the same feeling to which these things seemed divine conceived its ideal orator as one who controls a restless crowd by the royalty of his calm power, by a temperate and stately eloquence. The speaker who wins his hearers by blandishments, who surprises them by adroit turns, who hurries them away on a torrent of declamation, belonged to a generation for which gods also and heroes declaimed or quibbled on the stage. Plutarch has described, not without a tinge of sarcasm, the language and demeanour by which Perikles commanded the veneration of his age. His thoughts were awe-inspiring, his language lofty, untainted by the ribaldry of the rascal crowd. His calm features, never breaking into laughter; his measured step; the ample robe which flowed around him and which nothing deranged; his moving eloquence; the tranquil modulation of his voice; these things, and such as these, had over all men a marvellous spell. The biographer goes on to relate how Perikles was once abused by a coarse fellow in the market-place, bore it in silence until he had\n finished his business there, and when his persecutor followed him home, merely desired a slave to take a lantern and see the man home. It is not probable that the receiver of the escort felt all the severity of the moral defeat which he had sustained; and he is perhaps no bad representative of the Athenian democracy in its relations to the superb decorum of the old school. Much of this decorum survives in Antiphon, who, in a literary as in a political sense, clung to traditions which were fading. Yet even in him the influence of the age is seen. The Tetralogies, written for practice, and in which he had to please no one but himself, are the most stately of his compositions. The speech On the Murder of Herodes is less so, even in its elaborate proem; while part of the speech On the Choreutes, doubtless the latest of his extant works, shows a marked advance towards the freedom and vivacity of a newer style.

Its movement was slow; each word was dropped with deliberation; and now and then some important word, heavy with concentrated meaning, came down like a sledge-hammer. Take, for instance, the chapter in which Thucydides shows how party strife, like that in Corcyra, had the effect of confusing moral distinctions. Blow on blow the nicely-balanced terms beat out the contrasts, until the ear is weary as with the clangour of an anvil. Reckless daring was esteemed loyal courage,prudent delay, specious cowardice; temperance seemed a cloak for pusillanimity; comprehensive sagacity was called universal indifference. Remonstrance is for friends who err; accusation for enemies who have done wrong. In Antiphon's speech On the Murder of Herodes, the accused says (reminding the court that his case ought not to be decided until it has been heard before the Areiopagos):Be now, therefore, surveyors of the cause, but then, judges of the evidence,now surmisers, but then deciders, of the truth. And in the Second Tetralogy:Those who fail to do what they mean are agents of a mischance; those who hurt, or are hurt, voluntarily, are authors of suffering.\n Examples of this eagerness to press the exact meaning of words are frequent in Antiphon, though far less frequent than in Thucydides. It is evidently natural to that early phase of prose composition in which, newly conscious of itself as an art, it struggles to wring out of language a force strange to the ordinary idiom; and in Greece this tendency must have been further strengthened by the stress which Gorgias laid on antithesis, and Prodikos on the discriminating of terms nearly synonymous. Only so long as slow and measured declamation remained in fashion could the orator attempt thus to put a whole train of thought into a single weighty word.

The meaning of the antithesis is sufficiently clear in reference to Aeschylos and Pindar, the poets chosen by Dionysios as his instances. In reference to prose also it means a choice of images like theirs, bold, rugged, grand; and a scorn, on the other hand, for small prettinesses, for showy colouring, for maudlin sentiment. The great representative in oratory of this special trait must have been Perikles. A few of his recorded expressions bear just this stamp of a vigorous and daring fancy;his description of Aegina as the eyesore of\n the Peiraeus; his saying that, in the slain youth of Athens, the year had lost its spring; his declaration, over the bodies of those who fell at Samos, that they had become even as the gods; for the gods themselves we see not, but infer their immortality from the honours paid to them and from the blessings which they bestow. The same imaginative boldness is found in Antiphon, though but rarely, and under severe control. Adversity herself is wronged by the accused, he makes a prosecutor exclaim, when he puts her forward to screen a crime and to withdraw his own villainy from view. A father, threatened with the condemnation of his son, cries to the judges:I shall be buried with my sonin the living tomb of my childlessness. But in Antiphon, as in Thucydides, the haughty, careless freedom of the old style is shown oftener in the employment of new or unusual words or phrases. The orator could not, indeed, go so far as the historian, who is expressly censured on this score by his Greek critic; but they have some expressions of the same character in common. While\n Antiphon is sparing of imagery, he is equally moderate in the use of the technical figures of rhetoric. These have been well distinguished as figures of language () and figures of thought ()the first class including various forms of assonance and of artificial symmetry between clauses; the second including irony, abrupt pauses, feigned perplexity, rhetorical question and so forth. Caecilius of Calacte, the author of this distinction, was a student of Antiphon, and observed that the figures of thought are seldom or never used by him. The figures of language all occur, but rarely. Blass and K. O. Mller agree in referring this marked difference between the older and later schools of oratorythe absence, in the former, of those lively figures so abundant in the latterto an essential change which passed upon Greek character in the interval. It was only when fierce passion and dishonesty had become strong traits of a degenerate national character that vehemence and trickiness came into oratory. This seems a harsh and scarcely accurate judgment. It appears simpler to suppose that the conventional stateliness of the old eloquence altogether precluded such vivacity as marked the later; and that the mainspring of this new vivacity was merely the natural impulse, set free from the restraints of the older style, to give arguments their most spirited and effective form."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "8", "head": "Pathos and thos in Antiphon.", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Thuc.

That is, it addresses itself directly to the feelings; but does not care to give a subtle persuasiveness to its words by artistically adjusting them to the character and position of the person who is supposed to speak them. It is tragic; yet it is not dramatic. There has never, perhaps, been a greater master of stern and solemn pathos than Thucydides. The pleading of the Plataeans before their Theban judges, the dialogue between the Athenians and the Melians, the whole history of the Sicilian Expedition and especially its terrible closing scene, have a wonderful power over the feelings; and this power is in a great degree due to a certain irony. The reader feels throughout the restrained emotion of the historian; he is conscious that the crisis described was an agonising one, and that he is hearing the least that could be said of it from one who felt, and could have said, far more. On the other hand, a characteristic colouring, in the literary sense, is scarcely attempted by Thucydides. No writer is more consummate in making personal or national character appear in the history of actions. And when his characters speak, they always speak from the general point of view which he conceived to be appropriate to them. But in the form and language of their speeches there is little discrimination. Athenians and Lacedaemonians, Perikles and Brasidas, Kleon and Diodotos speak much in the same style; it is\n the ideas which they represent by which alone they are broadly distinguished. The case is nearly the same with Antiphon. His extant works present no subject so great as those of Thucydides, and his pathos is necessarily inferior in degree to that of the historian; but it resembles it in its stern solemnity, and also in this, that it owes much of its impressiveness to its self-control. The second and fourth speeches of the First Tetralogy, and the second and third of the Second, furnish perhaps the best examples. In thos, on the contrary, Antiphon is weak; and this, in a writer of speeches for persons of all ages and conditions, must be considered a defect. In the Herodes case the defendant is a young Mytilenean, who frequently pleads his inexperience of affairs and his want of practice as a speaker. The speech On the Choreutes is delivered by an Athenian citizen of mature age and eminent public services. But the two persons speak nearly in the same strain and with the same measure of self-confidence. Had Lysias been the composer, greater deference to the judges and a more decided avoidance of rhetoric would have distinguished the appeal of the young alien to an unfriendly court from the address of the statesman to his fellow citizens."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "9", "head": "The style of Antiphon:  how far periodic.", "p": [{"pb": {"@n": "32"}, "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "periodikh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ei)rome/nh le/cis"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ei)rome/nh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "kw=la"}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "le/cis ei)rome/nh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e(rm. peri\\ perio/dwn"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "dihrh|me/nh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "dialelume/nh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "dierrimme/nh"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "kommatikh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ko/mmata"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "katestramme/nh"}], "title": "Rhet.", "hi": {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "de Demosth."}, "#text": "(Arist.

But it ought to be remembered that neither Herodotos, nor any writer in a language which has passed beyond the rudest stage, exhibits the running style in an ideal simplicity. In its purest and simplest form, the running style is incompatible with the very idea of a literature. Wherever a literature exists, it contains the germ, however immature, of the periodic style; which, if the literature is developed, is necessarily developed along with it. For every effort to grasp and limit an idea naturally finds expression more or less in the periodic manner, the very nature of a period being to comprehend and define. In Herodotos, the running style, so congenial to his direct narrative, is dominant; but when he pauses and braces himself to state some theory, some general result of his observations, he tends to become periodic just because he is striving to be precise. From the time of Herodotos onward the periodic style is seen gradually more and more natured, according as men felt more and more the stimulus to find vigorous utterance for clear conceptions. Antiphon represents a moment at which this stimulus had become stronger than it had ever before\n been in the Greek world. His activity as a writer of speeches may be placed between the years 421 and 411 B.C.. The effects of the Peloponnesian war in sharpening political animosities had made themselves fully felt; that phase of Athenian democracy in which the contests of the ekklesia and of the lawcourts were keenest and most frequent had set in; the teaching of the Sophists had thrown a new light upon language considered as a weapon. Every man felt the desire, the urgent necessity, of being able in all cases to express his opinions with the most trenchant force; at any moment his life might depend upon it. The new intensity of the age is reflected in the speeches of Antiphon. Wherever the feeling rises highest, as in the appeals to the judges, he strives to use a language which shall pack the thoughts closely and bring them out roundly. But it is striking to observe how far this periodic style still is from the ease of Lysias or the smooth completeness of Isokrates. The harshness of the old rugged writing refuses to blend with it harmoniously,either taking it up with marked transitions, or suddenly breaking out in the midst of the most elaborate passages. It is everywhere plain that the desire to be compact is greater than the\n power. Antitheses and parallelisms are abundantly employed, giving a rigid and monotonous effect to the periods which they form. That more artistic period of which the several parts resemble the mutually-supporting stones of a vaulted roof, and which leads the ear by a smooth curve to a happy finish, has not yet been found. An imperfect sense of rhythm, or a habit of composition to which rhythmical restraint is intolerable except for a very short space, is everywhere manifest. The vinegar and the oil refuse to mingle. Thucydides presents the same phenomenon, but with some curious differences. It may perhaps be said that, while Antiphon has more technical skill (incomplete as that skill is) in periodic writing, Thucydides has infinitely more of its spirit. He is always at high pressure, always nervous, intense. He struggles to bring a large, complex idea into a framework in which the whole can be seen at once. Aristotle says that a period must be of a size to be taken in at a glance; and this is what Thucydides wishes the  of each sentence to be, though he is sometimes clumsy in the mechanism of the sentence itself. Dionysios mentions among the excellences which Demosthenes borrowed from the historian, his rapid movement, his terseness, his intensity, his sting; excellences, he adds, which\n neither Antiphon nor Lysias nor Isokrates possessed. This intensity, due primarily to genius, next to the absorbing interest of a great subject, does, in truth, place Thucydides, with all his roughness, far nearer than Antiphon to the ideal of a compact and masterly prose. Technically speaking, Thucydides as well as Antiphon must be placed in the border-land between the old running style and finished periodic writing. But the essential merits of the latter, though in a rude shape, have already been reached by the native vigour of the historian; while to the orator a period is still something which must be constructed with painful effort, and on a model admitting of little variety."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "10", "head": "Antiphon's treatment of subject-matter.", "p": [{"foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "prooi/mion"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "prokataskeuh/"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "dih/ghsis"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pi/steis"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)pi/logos"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ei)ko/ta"}], "pb": {"@n": "37"}, "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "See e.g. the argument in a circle in Tetr.

First a proem () explanatory or appealing; next an introduction (technically ) dealing with the circumstances under which the case had been brought into court, and noticing any informalities of procedure: then a narrative of the facts (): the arguments and proofs (), the strongest first, finally an epilogue or peroration (). The Tetralogies, being merely sketches for practice, have only proem, arguments and epilogue, not the introduction or the narrative. The speech On the Murder of Herodes and the speech On the Choreutes (in the latter of which the epilogue seems to have been lost) are the best examples of Antiphon's\n method. It is noticeable that in neither of these are the facts of the particular case dealt with closely or searchingly; and consequently in both instances the narrative of the facts falls into the background. Narrative was the forte of Andokides and Lysias; it appears to have been the weak side of Antiphon, who was strongest in general argument. General presumptions,those afforded, for instance, by the refusal of the prosecutors to give up their slaves for examination, or by the respective characters of prosecutor and prisoner and by their former relationsare most insisted upon. The First Tetralogy is a good example of Antiphon's ingenuity in dealing with abstract probabilities (); and the same preference for proofs external to the immediate circumstances of the case is traceable in all his extant work.

The same panegyric on the laws for homicide occurs, in the same words, both in the speech On the Choreutes and in that On the Murder of Herodes.  In the last-named speech the reflections on the strength of a good conscience, and the defendant's contention that he deserves pity, not punishment,\n are palpably commonplaces prepared for general use. Such patches, unless introduced with consummate skill, are doubly a blemish; they break the coherence of the argument and they destroy everything like fresh and uniform colouring; the speech becomes, as an old critic says, uneven. But the crudities inseparable from a new art do not affect Antiphon's claim to be considered, for his day, a great and powerful orator. In two things, says Thucydides, he was masterly,in power of conception and in power of expression. These were the two supreme qualifications for a speaker at a time when the mere faculty of lucid and continuous exposition was rare, and when the refinements of literary eloquence were as yet unknown. If the speaker could invent a sufficient number of telling points, and could put them clearly, this was everything. Antiphon, with his ingenuity in hypothesis and his stately rhetoric, fulfilled both requirements. Remembering the style of his oratory and his place in the history of the art, no one need be perplexed to reconcile the high praise of Thucydides with what is at first sight the startling judgment of Dionysios. That critic, speaking of the eloquence which aims at close reasoning and at victory in discussion, gives the foremost place in it to Lysias. He then mentions others who have practised it,Antiphon among the rest. Antiphon however, he says, has nothing but his antique and stern dignity; a fighter of causes () he is\n not, either in debate or in lawsuits. If, as Thucydides tells us, no one could help so well as Antiphon those who were fighting causes () in the ekklesia or the lawcourts; if, on his own trial, he delivered a defence of unprecedented brilliancy; in what sense is Dionysios to be understood? The explanation lies probably in the notion which the critic attached to the word agonist. He had before his mind the finished pleader or debater of a time when combative oratory considered as an art had reached its acme; when every discussion was a conflict in which the liveliest and supplest energy must be put forth in support of practised skill; when the successful speaker must grapple at close quarters with his adversary, and be in truth an agonist, an athlete straining every nerve for victory. Already Kleon could describe the agonistic eloquence which was becoming the fashion in the ekklesia as characterized by swift surprises, by rapid thrust and parry; already Strepsiades conceives the agonist of the lawcourts as bold, glib, audacious, headlong. This was not the character of Antiphon. He was a subtle reasoner, a master of expression, and furnished others with arguments and words; but he was not himself\n a man of the arena. He never descended into it when he could help; he had nothing of its spirit. He did not grapple with his adversary, but in the statelier manner of the old orators attacked him (as it were) from an opposite platform. Opposed in court to such a speaker as Isaeos, he would have had as little chance with the judges as Burke with one of those juries which Curran used to take by storm. Perhaps it was precisely because he was not in this sense an agonist that he found his most congenial sphere in the calm and grave procedure of the Areiopagos."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "11", "head": "Religious feeling of Antiphon.", "p": [{"bibl": {"@n": "Aesch.

Antiphon stood between the sophists who preceded and the orators who followed him as the first Athenian who was at once a theorist of rhetoric and a master of practical eloquence. The Tetralogies hold a corresponding place between merely ornamental exercises and real\n orations. Each of them forms a set of four speeches, supposed to be spoken in a trial for homicide. The accuser states his charge, and the defendant replies; the accuser then speaks again, and the defendant follows with a second reply. The imaginary case is in each instance sketched as lightly as possible; details are dispensed with; only the essential framework for discussion is supplied. Hence, in these skeleton-speeches, the structure and anatomy of the argument stand forth in naked clearness, stripped of everything accidental, and showing in bold relief the organic lines of a rhetorical pleader's thought. It was the essence of the technical rhetoric that it taught a man to be equally ready to defend either side of a question. Here we have the same man Antiphon himselfarguing both sides, with tolerably well-balanced force; and it must be allowed that much of the reasoningespecially in the Second Tetralogyis, in the modern sense, sophistical. In reference, however, to this general characteristic one thing ought to be borne in mind. The Athenian law of homicide was precise, but it was not scientific. The distinctions which it drew between various degrees of guilt in various sets of circumstances depended rather on minute tradition than on clear principle. A captious or even frivolous style of argument was invited by a code which employed vague conceptions in the elaborate classification of accidental details. Thus far the Tetralogies bear the necessary mark of the age which produced them. But in all else they are distinguished as widely as possible from the essays of a\n merely artificial rhetoric; not less from the displays of the elder sophists than from the declamations of the Augustan age. They are not only thoroughly real and practical, but they show Antiphon, in one sense, at his best.

In a case like the supposed one, three hypotheses were possible:that the cause of the impurity had been the thrower, the person struck, or the missile.\n Perikles and Protagoras spent a whole day in discussing a similar question.

He was one of the kleruchs among whom its territory was apportioned, but not otherwise wealthy. Having occasion to make a voyage to Aenos on the coast of Thrace, to receive the ransom of some Thracian captives who were in his hands, he sailed from Mytilene with the accused,a young man whose father, a citizen of Mytilene, lived chiefly at Aenos. Herodes and his companion were driven by a storm to put in at Methymna on the north-west coast of Lesbos; and there, as the weather was wet, exchanged their open vessel for another which was decked. After they had been drinking on board together, Herodes went ashore at night, and was never seen again. The accused, after making every inquiry for him, went on to Aenos in the open vessel; while the decked vessel, into which they had moved at Methymna, returned to Mytilene. On reaching the latter place again, the defendant was charged by the relatives of Herodes with having murdered him at the instigation of Lyknos, an Athenian living at Mytilene, who had been on bad terms with the deceased. They rested their charge principally on three grounds. First, that the sole companion of the missing man must naturally be considered accountable for his disappearance.

If the speech was written as a mere exercise, then it certainly is not the work of Antiphon, who would have treated the subject as he treats the subjects of the Tetralogicsin outline merely, without needless details of name or place. But there is no good ground for assuming that the speech was not spoken in a real cause. The story has some melodramatic features, but contains nothing which might not have occurred in ordinary Greek life. With the designation of the accused as Klytaemnestra, compare Andok.   129, ; Isaeos mentions :  (Or. VIII.)  3.

I. It has been urged that stories of this kind were often chosen as subjects by the rhetoricians of the schools; that the designation of the accused as Klytaemnestra is melodramatic; that the name Philoneos () seems fictitious; that the address to the Areiopagites as  in  7 is strange; and that the speech stands in the mss. before the Tetralogies. The last\n objection alone requires notice. The place of the speech in the mss. is, as Blass observes, due to the fact that it is the only accusatory speech; the Tetralogies comprise both accusation and defence; then come the defensive orations. On the other hand the prominence of narrative and the entire absence of argument in this speechin direct contrast to the Tetralogies, which are all argument and no narrativeand the unfitness of the subject for practising the ingenuity of an advocate, seem conclusive against the view that this was a mere exercise. II. The question of authenticity is more difficult. As regards matter, nothing can be weaker than the speech. There is no argument. An unsupported assertion that the accused had attempted the same crime before; the belief of the deceased that his wife was guilty; the refusal of the adversaries to give up their slaves; these are the only proofs. As regards style, there is much clumsy verbiage. On the other hand, the narrative ( 1420) shows real tragic power, especially in the\n contrast drawn between the unconsciousness of the miserable dupe and the craft of the instigator; throughout there is a pathos of the same kind as that of the Tetralogies, but higher; and lastly there is a strong resemblance to a particular passage in the speech On the Choreutes. The conclusion to which Blass comes appears sensible. Our knowledge of Antiphon's style is not so complete as to justify this rejection of the speech; but it must in any case be assigned to a period when both his argumentative skill and his power as a composer were still in a rude stage of their development."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "8", "head": "Lost works.", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Authorship of the treatises On Truth, On Concord, On Statesmanship."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "See p. 2, note 3."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "a)lhqei/as lo/goi"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "peri\\ o(monoi/as"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "politiko/s"}], "title": ["Fragm.

These are the speeches (or rather essays) On Truth, On Concord, On Statesmanship. As regards the first of these, indeed, the testimony of Hermogenes that it\n was the work of the Sophist has scarcely been questioned. But the treatise On Concord has often been given to the orator on the assumption that it was a speech, enforcing the importance of harmony, which he delivered in some political crisis, perhaps at the moment when the Four Hundred were threatened with ruin by internal dissensions. The treatise on Statesmanship, again, might, as far as the title witnesses, have been a practical exposition of oligarchical principles by the eloquent colleague of Peisandros. An examination of the fragments leads, however, to the almost certain conclusion that all these three works must be ascribed to the Sophist. The essay On Truth was a physical treatise, in which cosmic phenomena were explained mechanically in the fashion of the Ionic School. The essay On Concord was an ethical\n treatise, exhorting all men to live in harmony and friendship, instead of embittering their short lives by strife. The essay on Statesmanship was no party-pamphlet, but a discussion of the training required to produce a capable citizen. Besides the speeches known to the ancients, a work on the Art  of Rhetoric, and a collection of Proems and Epilogues, were current under Antiphon's name.  Sauppe and Spengel believe the Tetralogies to be examples taken from the Rhetoric; the latter, however, is expressly condemned as spurious by Pollux. The collection of Proems and Epilogues may, as Blass suggests, have furnished the opening and concluding passages of the Speech On the Murder of Herodes, and the opening passage of that On the Choreutes.

It was in May, 415, when he was about  twenty-five, when the Peiraeus was alive with preparations for the sailing of the fleet to Sicily, and all men were full of dreams of a new empire opening to the city, that Athens was astonished by a sacrilege, of which it is hard now to realise the precise effect upon the Athenian mind. When it appeared that the images of Hermes throughout the townin the marketplace, before the doors of houses, before the templeshad been mutilated in the night, the sense of a horrible impiety was joined to a sense of helplessness against revolution; for to an Athenian it would occur instinctively that the motive of the mutilators had been not simply to insult, but to estrange, the tutelar gods of the city. This terror, while still fresh, was intensified by the rumoured travesties in private houses of the innermost sacrament of Greek religion, the Mysteries of Eleusis. In order to understand the position of Andokides, it is necessary to keep these two affairs distinct. There is nothing to shew that he was in any way concerned, as accomplice or as informer, with the profanation of the Mysteries. As a matter of course, the author of the speech against him asserts it; but his own denial is emphatic and clear, and agrees with what is known from other sources. It was in the affair\n of the Hermae alone that he was implicated. The first important evidence in this matter was given by Teukros, a resident-alien, who had fled to Megara, and who was brought back to give information under a promise of impunity.

Fortytwo of these were denounced, among whom were Andokides, his father, his brother-in-law and ten other of his relatives. They were imprisoned at once; Diokleides was feasted as a public benefactor at the Prytaneion; and the whole town spent the night under arms, panic-stricken by the extent of the conspiracy,not knowing whence, when, or in what strength they might be attacked by the enemies of gods and men.

Then it was that\n Charmides, one of his cousins, besought him to tell all that he knew, and to save his father, his relations and all the innocent citizens who were threatened with an infamous death.

Great weight ought surely to be allowed to the circumstance that\n the Hermes before the house of Andokides was one of the very few which had not been mutilated. The explanation of this given by Andokides himself in 399 is at least plausible. Euphiletos, he says, had told the other conspirators that Andokides had himself undertaken the mutilation of this particular image; and so it escaped, Andokides being ill and ignorant of the whole matter. Now if Euphiletos had a spite against Andokides for having condemned his proposal, he could not, in fact, have taken a more effectual revenge. The sparing of this Hermes was just the circumstance, which, in the event, turned suspicion most strongly upon Andokides. Had he been out himself that night and engaged in the sacrilege, he could scarcely have failed to think of a danger so evident, and would have taken care that his own house should not be marked out by its immunity. If the number of mutilators was as small as he states, the neglect of such a precaution is altogether inconceivable. The conjecture to which we should incline is that the Hermae were mutilated by the small club of young men to which Andokides belonged, but that, for some reason or other, he had no hand in it; that, however, when he gave his evidence at the time, he accused himself of having been actively concerned, thinking that otherwise the rest of his story would be disbelieved.

The soundness of this view was proved in the sequel.

At the age of twenty-five he is banished for the Hermae affair; he is defeated, on the same ground, in two attempts to return; at the end of sixteen years he is brought to trial for impiety; and his acquittal is the last thing recorded about him. At that time he was only forty-one; already, since his return in 402, he had discharged public services; and now, formally acquitted of the charges which had so long hung over him, he might hope for a new career. His speech On the Peace shows that in 390 he was sufficiently trusted by his fellow-citizens to have been sent as a plenipotentiary to Sparta; and proves also, by its statesmanlike good sense, his fitness for such a trust. But, except in this speech, nothing is recorded of his later and probably brighter years. History knows him only under a cloud. It was, moreover, his misfortune that while the informations which he laid in 415 made him hateful to the oligarchs, his hereditary connexion with\n oligarchy exposed him to the continual suspicion of the democrats. One year he is imprisoned by the Four Hundred; the next he is repulsed by the ekklesia. It would be an easy inference that there must have been something palpably bad and false in the man to whom both parties were harsh, did not a closer view show that one party may have been influenced by spite and the other by prejudice. Many of those who believed that Andokides was concerned in the mutilation of the Hermae must have regarded him with sincere horror. But on the other hand it should be remembered that such horror is never so loudly expressed, and is never so useful to personal enmity, as at a time when a popular religion, still generally professed, is beginning to be widely disbelieved. Diagoras and Sokrates were accused of impiety with the more effect because the views ascribed to them resembled the real views of many who seemed orthodox. Besides those who hated Andokides as an informer, as an oligarch, or as an iconoclast, there were probably many who regarded him with that special kind of dislike which attaches to a person who drives the world into professing angry conviction on matters to which it is secretly indifferent. Viewed apart from the feelings which worked on his contemporaries, the facts of his life seem to warrant severe blame as little as they warrant high praise. His youthful associates were dissolute; through them he was involved, rightly or wrongly, in the suspicion of a great impiety; and this suspicion clung to him for years.

As regards diction, in the first place his figures are said to be wanting in clear articulation (). Hermogenes elsewhere enumerates thirteen figures of rhetoric, which are either certain fixed modes of framing sentences, such as the antithesis and the period; or (in the phrase of Caecilius) figures of thought, such as irony and dilemma. Hermogenes means that Andokides does not use figures of either sort with precision; he does not work them out to an incisive distinctness; he leaves them inarticulatestill in the rough, and with their outlines dull. Again Andokides has little finish ()a term by which his critic means refinement and smoothness in composition. Lastly, Andokides is said to be wanting in fiery earnestness. The word , which we have attempted thus to paraphrase, plays a very important point in the rhetorical terminology of Hermogenes: it describes one of the three cardinal excellences of political\n oratory. Perhaps no simple English equivalent can be found for it. But Hermogenes has explained clearly what he means by it. He means earnest feeling, especially indignation, uttered in terse, intense, sometimes abrupt language.

Now the canon of the Ten Attic Orators was probably drawn up at the time when scholastic rhetoric was most flourishing, and when, therefore, the standard of criticism used by Hermogenes and Herodes was the common one. It may seem surprising, then, that Andokides was numbered in the decad at all. Kritias, his contemporary, whom so many ancient writers praise highly, might be supposed to have had stronger claims; and the fact that the memory of Kritias as a statesman was hateful, is not enough in itself to explain his exclusion\n from a literary group. Probably one reason, at least, for the preference given to Andokides was the great interest of the subjects upon which he spoke. The speech on the Mysteries, supplying, as it does, the picturesque details of a memorable event, had an intrinsic value quite apart from its merits as a composition. The speech On the Peace with Lacedaemon, again, gives a clear picture of a crisis in the Corinthian War; and is an illustration, almost unique in its way, of Athenian history at the time just after the rebuilding of the walls by Konon, when, for the first time since Aegospotami, Athenian visions of empire were beginning to revive. As Lykurgos seems to have owed his place among the Ten chiefly to his prominence as a patriot, so Andokides may have been recommended partly by his worth as an indirect historian. Again, Dionysios, as we have seen, recognised at least the philological value of Andokides.

Both these notices recognise Andokides as an authority for the idiom of his own day; and it is evident that he had a philological interest for the critic. On the other hand it is clear that Dionysios discovered in him no striking power; for Andokides does not occur in his long list of men foremost in the various departments of oratory. Quintilian names him only in one slighting allusion. Who, he asks, is to be our model of Attic eloquence? Let it be Lysias; for his is the style in which the lovers of Atticism delight.

They analyse special features of language and of method; they determine with nicety the rank of each man as a composer; but they too often forget that, for the just estimation of his rank as a speaker, the first thing necessary is an effort of imaginative sympathy. We must not merely analyse his style; we must try to realise the effect which some one of his speeches, as a whole, would have made on a given audience in given circumstances. As nearly all the great orators of antiquity had been trained in the rudiments of the technical rhetoric, the judgment upon their relative merits is not, as a rule, much disturbed by this tendency in their critics. It may often, indeed, be felt that the judgment, however fair in itself, is based too much upon literary grounds. But, in most cases, so far as we can judge, no great injustice is done. Criticism of this kind may, however, happen to be unjust; and it has certainly been unjust in the case of Andokides. Others far excel him in finish of style, in clearness of arrangement, in force and in fire; but no one can read the speech On the Mysteries (for instance) without feeling that Andokides was a real orator. The striking thing in that speech is a certain undefinable tone which assures even the modern reader that Andokides was saying the right things to the judges, and knew himself to be saying the right things. He is, in places, obscure or diffuse; he sometimes wanders from the issue, once or twice\n into trivial gossip; but throughout there is this glow of a conscious sympathy with his hearers.

Antiphon consciously strives to rise above the language of daily life; he seeks to impress by a display of art. Lysias carefully confines himself to the language of daily life; he seeks to persuade by the use of hidden art. Andokides usually employs the language of daily life; he is free, or almost free, from the archaisms of Antiphon, and writes in the new-Attic dialect, the dialect of Lysias and his successors. On the\n other hand, he does not confine himself to a rigid simplicity. In his warmer or more vigorous passages, especially of invective or of intreaty, he often employs phrases or expressions borrowed from the idiom of Tragedy. These, being of too decidedly poetical a colour, have a tawdry effect; yet it is evident that they have come straight from the memory to the lips; they are quite unlike prepared fine things; and they remind us, in fact, how really natural a speaker was Andokides,neither aiming, as a rule, at ornament, nor avoiding it on principle when it came to him. The plainness of Lysias is an even, subtle, concise plainness, so scrupulous to imitate nature that nature is never suffered to break out; the plainness of Andokides is that of a man who, with little rhetorical or\n literary culture, followed chiefly his own instinct in speaking. Lysias had at his command all the resources of technical rhetoric, but so used them towards producing a sober, uniform effect that his art is scarcely felt at any particular point; it is felt only in the impression made by the whole. Andokides had few of such resources. As his  biographer says, he is sparing of figures. Here the distinction already noticed between figures of language and figures of thought must be kept in mind. Andokides uses scarcely at all the figures of language: that is, he seldom employs antitheses aims at parallelism between the forms of two sentencesor studies the niceties of assonance. His neglect of such refinementswhich, in his day, constituted the essence of oratorical art, and which must have been more or less cultivated by nearly all public speakershas one noticeable effect on his composition. There is no necessary connection between an antithetical and a periodic style. But, in the time of Andokides, almost the only period in use was that which is formed by the antithesis\n or parallelism of clauses. Hence, since he rarely uses antitheses or parallelisms, Andokides composes far less in a periodic style than Thucydides or Antiphon or even Lysias.

Dionysios notices such interfusion as a special mark of art in Isaeos. In Andokides it is rather a mark of artlessness. He had a long story to tell, and was unable, or did not try, to tell it concisely. The very length of his narrative compelled him to break it up into pieces and to comment upon each piece separately. He has not effected this without some loss of clearness, and one division of the speech is thoroughly confused.

A disciple of the sophistical rhetoric learned to deal copiously and skilfully with those commonplaces of argument which would be available in almost any case.

We see this in Antiphon's First Tetralogy: it is a model exercise in making the utmost of abstract probabilities as inferred from facts which are very slightly sketched. In the speech On the Murder of Herodes the statement of the facts is hurried over, and there is no attempt at a close and searching analysis of them. But for a speaker unskilled in rhetorical commonplace the particulars of any given subject would be everything. Picturesque narration, shrewd inference from small circumstances, lively illustration of character would naturally be his chief resources. And so it is with Andokides. His strength is in narrative, as the strength of Antiphon is in argument. Andokides relies on his case, Antiphon on his science; it is only Lysias who hits the masterly mean, who makes his science the close interpreter of his case, who can both recount and analyse. But, although the narrative element in Andokides exceeds the just proportion always observed by Lysias, it is, from a  literary point of view, a great charm.

(1) Plutarch quotes an address To the Associates, or members  of the oligarchical clubs, as authority for a statement that the remains of Themistokles had been dishonoured at Athens; but adds that the statement was made by Andokides merely for the purpose of exasperating the oligarchs against the people. Ruhnken, with whom Sauppe agrees, thought that this Address was a letter written by Andokides, then in exile, to the fellow-conspirators of Peisandros in 411. But the breach of Andokides with the oligarchical party, after his informations in 415, was decisive and final; when he returned to Athens in 411 he was at once denounced by Peisandros and imprisoned. It seems better, then, with Kirchhoff and Blass, to refer this Address to an earlier time than 415: perhaps to the years 420418, a period\n of keen struggle between the oligarchical and popular  parties at Athens. (2) The Deliberative Speech quoted by the lexicographers is identified by Kirchhoff with the last-mentioned. Its title seems, however, to show plainly that it was of a different kind, and was either spoken, or supposed to be spoken, in  debate in the ekklesia. (3) Harpokration once quotes a Speech On the Information () for the word , which occurs twice in the speech On the Mysteries. Hence the two speeches have sometimes been identified. But the pseudo-Plutarch expressly distinguishes them. And the author of the speech against Andokides states that two informations had been laid against him in the same year. It is true that there is no proof of the earlier information having resulted in a trial; and that the title of the lost speech, if really distinct from the  was ill-chosen. But it is difficult to suppose that the biographer could have made such a blunder as to quote the same speech by two different titles in the same sentence. On the whole, Sauppe's view, that the speech On the Mysteries and the speech On the Information were distinct, appears most probable. If the lost speech referred, like the  to the Hermae case, it must have contained the word which Harpokration quotes; and it would have been natural for him to\n quote it from the earlier of the two compositions in which it occurred. (4) The Reply to Phaeax is  known only from the pseudo-Plutarch, who does not name the speech Against Alkibiades. It has been shown that the latter is probably the work of a late sophist; and it is likely that Phaeax, rather than Andokides, was intended to be the speaker. If, then, it could be assumed that Reply to Phaeax is an inaccurate quotation of the title, which ought to have been cited as Reply  Phaeax, there is no difficulty in supposing the identity of this work with the extant speech Against Alkibiades."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Doubtful fragments."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "title": ["O.

Immediately upon the return from the Peiraeus to the city in the spring of 403, Thrasybulos proposed that the citizenship should be conferred upon Lysias; and the proposal was carried in the ekklesia. In one respect, however, it was informal. No measure could, in strictness, come before the popular assembly which was not introduced by a preliminary resolution (probouleuma) of the Senate. But at the moment when this decree was passed, the Senate had not yet been reconstituted after the anarchy; and the probouleuma had therefore been wanting. On this ground Archnos, a\n colleague of Thrasybulos, arraigned the decree (under the Graph Paranomn) as unconstitutional, and it was annulled.

It was in the latter part of the fourth century B. C. that Greek critics began regularly to distinguish three styles of rhetorical composition, the grand, the plain and the middle. The grand style aims constantly at rising above the common idiom; it seeks ornament of every kind, and rejects nothing as too artificial if it is striking. The plain style may, like the first, employ the utmost efforts of art, but the art is concealed; and, instead of avoiding, it imitates the language of ordinary life. The middle style explains itself by its name. Theophrastos appears to have been the first writer on Rhetoric who attempted such a classification; there is, at least, no hint of it in Aristotle or in the Rhetorica ad Alexandrum. Vague as the\n classification necessarily is, it was frequently modified according to the taste of individual teachers. The two extremesthe grand and the plain styleswere recognised by all; but some discerned two, some three shades between them; while others thought it needless to distinguish anything intermediate. On the whole, however, the tripartite division kept its ground down to Roman times. It was adopted, with variations of detail, by Cicero, Dionysios and Quintilian. The characteristics of the plain style  with which we are most concerned at presentare only sketched by Dionysios; but they are more\n precisely given by Cicero. There is a difference, indeed, between the points of view of the two critics. Dionysios treats the three styles historically; Cicero treats them theoretically. The middle style of Cicero differs, therefore, from the middle style of Dionysios in being an ideal. But Cicero's description of the plain style, at least, would probably have been accepted in the main by Dionysios; and it is clear that for Cicero, as for Dionysios, Lysias was the canon of that style.

In order that the originality of Lysias may not be\n underrated, attention must be given to the precise meaning of this statement. It appears to speak of him merely as having succeeded better than others in a style used by nearly all writers of speeches for the law-courts. But what was, in fact, common to him and them was this onlythe avoidance of decidedly poetical ornament and the employment of sober prose. This is all that the plain style, as opposed to the elaborate, necessarily means. That which he had, and which no other had in the same degree, was the art of so writing this prose that it should be in character with the person who spoke it. Their style was monotonously plain; his was plain too, but it was more, it was variously natural. Dionysios shows elsewhere that he appreciated to the full the originality of Lysias; but he has hardly brought it out with sufficient clearness in the passage which has just been noticed.

Prose composition in its infancy was a craft, a close profession, just as much as poetry. Beside the sacred band of wise poets stood the small group of experts skilled to fashion artistic prose. When a man wished for help in a law-suit he applied, as a matter of course, if he could afford it, to one of these; and it was equally a matter of course that the speech supplied to him should bear the same stamp as others turned out by the same machine. There was no pretence of its being the work of the speaker, and no expectation, therefore, that it should reflect his nature; a certain rhetorical colour, certain recognized forms of argument and appeal, were alone looked for.

But, even without this purpose, an instinctive dislike of exaggeration would of itself have given his style some general characteristics, sufficient to distinguish it from that of any of his contemporaries. On this account we must dissent from a view advanced by K. O. Mller in his History of Greek Literature.\n Lysias had, he thinks, two distinct styles at two different periods of his life; the earlier, forced and artificial; the later, plain. Mller recognises the former in the speech in the Phaedros, and in the Epitaphios. The turning-point was, he conceives, the impeachment of Eratosthenes, when a real feeling of pain and anger in the mind of Lysias gave a more lively and natural flow both to his spirits and to his speech. This occasionMller adds convinced Lysias what style of oratory was both the most suited to his own character and also least likely to fail in producing an effect upon the judges. Ingenious as the theory is, we have no belief in the fact of any such abrupt transition as it supposes. That temperate mastery with which Lysias cultivated the plain style is doubly a marvel if it was only a sudden practical experience which weaned him from his first love for a forced and artificial rhetoric. Converts are not proverbial for discretion; and the exquisite judgment shown by Lysias after his supposed reformation ought to have prevented its necessity. Like all his contemporaries he must, unquestionably, have had his earliest training in the florid Sicilian school; but there is nothing to show that its precepts ever took a strong hold upon him; and there is overwhelming reason to believe that a genius of the bent of his must very early have thrown off such pedantic trammels. It is true that the speech in the Phaedros assuming its genuinenessis more stiffly composed than any of his presumably later writings: but, on the other hand, it is, as Mller allows, entirely free from the ornaments of Gorgias.\n As for the Epitaphios, its spuriousness is now a generally recognised fact."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "5", "head": "Special characteristics of his style.", "p": "Plainness and an easy versatility are, then, the general characteristics of Lysias.

In another place, however, he praises Lysias for a vigour, essential in contests, which packs thoughts closely and brings them out roundly ()that is, in terse periods. Both remarks are just. Nothing more strikingly distinguishes Lysias from his predecessors and from nearly all his successors than the degree in which the structure of his sentences varies according to his subject. His speeches may in this respect be classified under three heads. First, those which are of a distinctly public character; in which the composition is thoroughly rhythmical, and which abound with artistic periods, single or combined.\n Secondly, those speeches which, from the nature of their subjects, blend the private with the public character; which show not only fewer combinations or groups of periods, but a less careful formation of single periods. Thirdly, the essentially private speeches; which differ from the second class, not in the mould of such periods as occur, but in the larger mixture with these of sentences or clauses not periodic. Further, in each of these three classes, a greater freedom of composition distinguishes the narrative from the argument. The narrative parts of the properly public speeches are usually thrown into what may be called the historical as opposed to the oratorical period; that is, the sentences are more loosely knit and are drawn out to a greater length. According as the speech has more of a private character, these freer periods are more and more relaxed into a simple series () of longer or shorter clauses. Yet, while there are so many shades in the composition of Lysias, the colour of the whole is individual. Isokrates develops period out of period in long,\n luxuriant sequence; Demosthenes intersperses the most finished and most vigorous periods with less formally built sentences which relieve them; Lysias binds his periods, by twos or threes at the most, into groups always moderate in size but often monotonous in form; excelling Isokrates in compactness, but yielding to Demosthenes in life."}}, {"@type": "subsection", "@n": "2", "head": "His Dictionits purity.", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "title": "De Lys.", "#text": "Dionys.  c. 2."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "ib."}, "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "to\\ kaqaro\\n tw=n o(noma/twn"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "h( a)kri/beia th=s diale/ktou"}], "#text": "c. 13, where the purity spoken of in c, 2 is defined as consisting of two elements and ."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "bibl": [{"@n": "Lys. 1.17", "#text": "Or.

Dionysios may be taken as a competent judge. He pronounces Lysias to be perfectly pure in expression, the best canon of Attic speech, not of the old used by Plato and Thucydides, but of that which was in vogue in his own time. This may be seen, he adds, by a comparison with the writings of Andokides, Kritias and many others. Two ideas are included under the purity praised here; abstinence from words either obsolete () or novel, or too decidedly poetical; and abstinence from constructions foreign to the idiom of the day an excellence defined elsewhere as accuracy of dialect. Lysias is not rigidly pure in these respects.\n The only instance of an old-fashioned syntax, indeed, which has been noticed in him, is the occasional use of  as a copula; nor does he use such pedantic words as were meant by glossae; but rare or poetical words and phrases occur in many places.

Isokrates had the same command of familiar words, but he was not content to seek effect by artistic harmonies of these. His ambition was to be ornate; and hence one of the differences remarked by Dionysios: Isokrates is sometimes vulgar; Lysias never is. There is one kind of ornament, however, which Lysias uses largely, and in respect to which he deserts the character of the plain style. He delights in the artistic parallelism (or opposition) of clauses. This may be effected: (1) by simple correspondence of clauses in length (isoklon); (2) by correspondence of word with word in meaning (antitheton proper); (3) by correspondence of word with word in sound (paromoion).

It is shown, as Dionysios says, in three thingsthought, diction, and composition; that is, the ideas, the words, and the style in which the words are put together, always suit the person to whom they are ascribed. There is hardly one of\n the extant speeches of Lysias upon which this peculiar power has not left its mark. Many of them, otherwise poor in interest, have a permanent artistic value as describing, with a few quiet touches, this or that type of man. For instance, the Defence which is the subject of the Twenty-first Oration is interesting solely because it embodies to the life that proud consciousness of merit with which a citizen who had deserved well of the State might confront a calumny. In the speech on the Sacred Olive, if the nameless accused is not a person for us, he is at least a characterthe man who shrinks from public prominence of any kind, but who at the same time has a shy pride in discharging splendidly all his public duties.

What, asks Dionysios, is the freshness of a beautiful face? What is fine harmony in the movements and windings of music? What is rhythm in the measurement of times? As these things baffle definition, so does the charm of Lysias. It cannot be taken to pieces by reasoning; it must be seized by a cultivated instinct. It is the final criterion of his genuine work. When I am puzzled about one of the speeches ascribed to him, and when it is hard for me to find the truth by other marks, I have recourse to this excellence, as to the last piece on the board. Then, if the Graces of Speech seem to me to make the writing fair, I count it to be of the soul of Lysias; and I care not to look further into it. But if the stamp of the language has no winningness, no loveliness, I am chagrined, and suspect that after all the speech is not by Lysias; and I do no more violence to my instinct, even though in all else the speech seems to me clever and well-finished; believing that to write well, in special styles other than this, is given to many men; but that to write winningly, gracefully, with loveliness, is the gift of Lysias."}, {"emph": "not", "#text": "A modern reader would be sanguine if he hoped to analyse the distinctive charm of Lysias more closely than Dionysios found himself able to do.

Evidently the same cause which in great measure disqualifies a modern for estimating the purity of the language of Lysias also disqualifies him for estimating its charm. This charm may be supposed to have consisted partly in a certain felicity of expression,Lysias having a knack of using the word which, for some undefinable reason, was felt to be curiously right; partly in a certain essential urbanity, the reflection of a nature at once genial and refined. The first quality is evidently beyond the sure appreciation of a modern ear: the second less so, yet scarcely to be estimated with nicety, since here too shades of expression are concerned.

But in no case is there anything more elaborate than this fourfold partition, and in no case is the sequence of the parts altered. This simple arrangement, contrasting with the manifold subdivisions which Plato notices as used by the rhetoricians of his day, is usually said to have been first made by Isokrates. This may be true in the sense that it was he who first stated it theoretically. In practice, however, it had already been employed by Lysias; and more strictly than by Isokrates himself. The difference between their systems, according to Dionysios, is precisely this;Lysias uses always the same simple framework, never interpolating, subdividing or defining; Isokrates knows how to break the uniformity by transpositions of his own devising, or by novel episodes. The same difference, in a stronger form, separates Lysias here from his imitator in much else, Isaeos. Every kind of artifice is used by Isaeos in shifting, subdividing, recombining the four rudimentary elements of the speech according to the special conditions of the case. It was this versatile tact in disposing his forcesthis generalship, as Dionysios in one place calls itwhich chiefly procured for Isaeos the reputation of unequalled adroitness in fighting a bad\n cause. Lysias had consummate literary skill and much acuteness; but his weapons were better than his plan of campaign; he was not a subtle tactician.

This self-restraint will be best understood by comparing a passage of Lysias with a similar passage of Andokides.

A like scene is described in the speech Against Agoratos, when the persons whom he had denounced took farewell in prison of their kinswomen. But the two orators take different means of producing a tragic effect. There were cries and lamentations, says Andokides, weeping and wailing for the miseries of the hour. Lysias simply remarks that the wife who came to see her husband had already put on mourning. For hearers of a certain\n class the pathos of facts is more eloquent than an express appeal; but the speaker who is content to rely upon it renounces the hope of being found pathetic by the multitude.

They indicate a power which sufficed to elaborate them, rather than a power which gave them their special qualities out of an affluence of resource. Two speeches, however, must be named, one of which shows (in what remains of it) the inspiration of a great idea, the other, the inspiration of an ardent feeling.

Isaeos was a careful student of Lysias. If Aristotle seldom quoted him, if Theophrastos appears to have missed and Demetrics to have underrated his peculiar merits, one of the first orators of their generation, Deinarchos, often took him for a model. When\n the taste for Attic simplicity, lost during two centuries in the schools of Asia, revived at Rome, Lysias was recognised as its truest representative. Though most of his Roman imitators appear to have become feeble in seeking to be plain, one of them, Licinius Calvus, is allowed at least the praise of elegance. Cicero's criticism of Lysias is not close; it does not analyse with any exactness the special qualities of his style; but the general appreciation which it shows is just. For Cicero, Lysias is the model, not of a plain style merely, but of Attic refinement; he has also the highest degree of vigour; and though grandeur was seldom possible in the treatment of such subjects as he chose, some passages of his speeches have elevation. Yet, while Demosthenes could use the simplicity of Lysias, it is doubtful (Cicero thinks) whether Lysias could ever have risen to the height of Demosthenes;\n Lysias is almost a second Demosthenes, or, what is the same thing, almost a perfect orator; but his mastery is limited to a province. The Augustan age produced by far the best and fullest of known ancient criticisms upon Lysias, that of Dionysios. The verdict of Caecilius has perished with his work on the Ten Orators; but the remark preserved from it, that Lysias was abler in the invention than in the arrangement of arguments, shows discernment. This quality marks in a less degree the judgments of subsequent writers. Quintilian only commends Lysias in general terms for plain elegance of language and mastery of clear exposition; Hermogenes especially praises, not his winningness, but his hidden force, classing him, with Isaeos and Hypereides, next to Demosthenes in political eloquence. Photios goes wide of the\n mark; he praises Lysias for those things in which he was relatively weak, pathos and sublime intensity; and disputes the just observation of Caecilius that Lysias excelled in invention rather than in arrangement."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "14", "head": "Lysias and his Successors.", "p": [{"pb": {"@n": "198"}, "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Services of Lysias to the prose idiom."}, "#text": "A few words will be enough to mark the broad differences between Lysias and those three of his successors who may best be compared with him, Isaeos, Isokrates and Demosthenes.

But while Lysias hides his art in order to be more winning, Isokrates aims openly at the highest artificial ornament, and escapes being frivolous or frigid only by the greatness of most of his subjects and the earnestness with which he treats them. Isaeos, a direct student of Lysias, resembles him most in his diction, which is not only, like that of Isokrates, clear and pure, but concise also; further, he strives, like his master, to conceal his art, but never quite succeeds in this.

The Olympic oration of Gorgias was renowned; and at Delphi his golden statue stood in the temple where, during the panegyris, he had thundered his Pythian speech from the altar. If only as displays of rhetorical art, such harangues were in harmony with the character of the great Panhellenic meetings, the central idea of which was open competition in every sort of excellence, physical and mental. But the speaker at such a time would have certain practical themes suggested to him by the occasion itself, and would enjoy a rare opportunity of treating them with practical effect. He could interpret and apply to passing events the thought, necessarily present to every mind in such an assemblage, of a common Hellenic brotherhood. Gorgias had not failed to strike this chord. His speech at Olympia dealt with the largest of political questions. Seeing Greece torn by faction, he became a counsellor of concord, seeking to turn the Greeks against the barbarians, and advising them to take\n for the prizes of their arms not each others' cities but the land of the barbarians.

But two things are in favour of the view that the Epitaphios was a mere rhetorical exercise; first, the character of the references to supposed contemporary events,references particular enough to have been inserted by a composer anxious for the appearance of reality, yet not exactly corresponding with any known situation; secondly, the neglect of topics which a mere exercise could afford to ignore, but which in a real oration would, according to all fitness and all usage, be prominentthe topics of practical advice and of consolation. This Epitaphios says little enough\n about the dead; it scarcely attempts to exhort or to comfort the living. If, then, we may assume what the general character of the speech indicatesthat it was composed merely as a rhetorical essaythe next question isWas Lysias the author? The external evidence is inconclusive. Harpokration and Theon ascribe it without suspicion to Lysias. Aristotle quotes from  Epitaphios a passage which is found in our speech, but does not name Lysias, though in the same chapter he cites Perikles, Isokrates and others by name. Nothing, however, can fairly be inferred from this except that in Aristotle's time the speech was celebrated. Dionysios nowhere mentions an Epitaphios by Lysias; and his silence is suspicious. Turning from the external to the internal evidence, we find that this is overwhelmingly against the authorship of Lysias. All his leading characteristicssimplicity, grace, clearness, the sense of symmetryare conspicuous by their absence. The structure of the whole is clumsy; the special topics are ill-arranged, and receive a treatment sometimes meagre, sometimes extravagantly diffuse; the language is affected, turgid and in many places obscure to a degree which makes it inconceivable that this oration and the fragment of the Olympiakos can be the work of the\n same man. There are several resemblances of expression between this Epitaphios and the Panegyrikos of Isokrates, and these have often been explained by supposing Isokrates to have borrowed from Lysias. But let any careful reader note how thoroughly the more rhetorical parts of the Epitaphios bear the stamp of a cento, and he will prefer to suppose that some very inferior writer has borrowed from Isokrates. No weight can be allowed to the argument that Plato in the Menexenos (386 B. C.?) had this particular Epitaphios in view. The Menexenos goes, indeed, over very nearly the same range of subjects; but these subjects were the commonplaces of commemorative oratory, and the coincidence is no warrant for assuming a direct imitation. If it may be taken for granted that Aristotle's citation in the Rhetoric is from our Epitaphios, the composition of the speech, whoever was the author, may be placed between 380 and 340 B. C..

Thus the speeches Against Eratosthenes [Or. XII.] and Against Agoratos [Or.

Yet the father of Timotheos was at least ten times as rich as the father of Aristophanes ( 2841).

His family had never been involved in any troubles until the time of the Thirty Tyrants. Theognis and Peison, members of that body, suggested the policy of plundering the residentaliens. These two men first paid a visit to the shield-manufactory of Lysias and his brother, and took an inventory of the slaves. They next came to the dwelling-house of Lysias, and got all his ready money, about three talents. He managed to slip away from them, and took refuge with a friend in the Peiraeus; then, hearing that his brother Polemarchos had been met in the street by Eratosthenes and taken to prison, he escaped by night to Megara. Polemarchos received the usual mandate of the Thirtyto drink the hemlock; and had a beggar's burial. Though he and Lysias had yielded such rich plunder, the very earrings were taken from the ears of his wife ( 19). Now the murderer of Polemarchos was Eratosthenes ( 423). Here he is briefly cross-examined:", "Did you arrest Polemarchos or not? Terrified by the orders of the authoritiesI proceeded to do so. And were you in the council chamber when we were being talked about? I was. Did you support, or oppose, those who advised our execution? Opposed them. Opposed our being put to death? Yes.

If it is true that he opposed the sentence, he must at least prove that he did not make the arrest, or did not make it in a harsh manner. The judges are then\n reminded of the importance which their decision will have as an example for both citizens and foreigners.

The compass of the power shown may best be measured by the two passages which mark its limits on the one hand, the account of the arrest of Polemarchos, which has almost the flow of Herodotean narrative;on the other hand, the passionate appeal to the two classes of men who had suffered from the Thirtyworked up with all the resources of a finished rhetoric. As regards the first, what may be called the private, division of the speech, it is very noticeable how little attempt Lysias makes to excite compassion; he contents himself with a bare recital of facts. He relies less on the atrocity of the wrong itself than on its significance as part of that system of organised crime which he sees personified in Eratosthenes. He therefore throws his whole weight upon the second, the public, division of his subject; and here he gives us, first, two political biographies, the lives of Eratosthenes and Theramenesthen, a retrospect of the government to which they belonged. In one sense this speech of Lysias may be compared with that of Demosthenes On the Crown. The question at issue involves a whole chapter of Athenian history, in which both the parties to the case were actors. But there is a difference. Demosthenes, the statesman, reviews the train of events with which he deals from the level of one who has helped to determine\n their course. Lysias stands on the lower ground of a private person; he sees the events of the Anarchy as they were seen by the masses who suffered, but were powerless to control; he does not discuss two rival lines of policy, but recalls, as a common man, experiences familiar to thousands. It is just because he speaks from among the crowd that he is so successful in denouncing Eratosthenes, and leaves the impression that in his attack upon the worst of close oligarchies he was the spokesman of an entire people."}]}]}, {"@type": "subsection", "@n": "2", "head": "VI. 2.

Surely the time just  the surrenderwhen Athens was full of misery and factionmight be called a troubled time.No doubt Lysias had a motive for placing the informations of Agoratos before the capitulation, and thus representing him as responsible for it. On the other hand, it may be observed that the oligarchs would not have had the same motive for suborning Agoratos when the peace, which gave them the ascendancy, had been ratified.An ingenious attempt has been made (by Christian Renner,  Gottingen 1869) to show that it is consistent with the narrative of Lysias to suppose that the peace had been  and that the popular leaders, when denounced by Agoratos, were only agitating for a  of it.

Those who take the latter view, lay stress upon the discrepancies between this speech and the speech of Andokides On the Mysteries. Two of these discrepancies are important. (1) Andokides complains of having been specially charged with denouncing his own father (  19): here, he is only accused generally of denouncing his kinsfolk ( 23). Again (2) he speaks of having been charged with placing a suppliant's bough in the temple at Eleusis (  110); here nothing of the kind is mentioned. But in regard to such differences, it should be\n remembered that this speech, itself mutilated, was not the only one for the prosecution; and that, where the subjects of accusation were so large and covered so many years, it would have been strange if every point had been touched by every accuser. On the other hand a rhetorician who had prepared himself by studying the Speech On the Mysteries would have aimed at a more exact correspondence with it. He would probably have taken the charges against Andokides in the order set by his model, and have given paragraph for paragraph, or at least topic for topic. He must have been a subtle artist indeed, if with a general agreement he combined so many intentional differences of detail. It may be noticed that in  46. Andokides is said to be upwards of forty years old. This statement has been used as an argument for the late origin of the speech by those who identify the orator Andokides with the general named by Thucydides (I. 51) as holding a command in 435 B.C. But if, as is most probable, the general was the grandfather of the orator, and the age of the latter in 399 B.C. was really about forty, then the statement in  46 is one reason the more for ascribing the speech to a contemporary of Andokides. As regards the faults of expression, of method or of general tone, these help to disprove the authorship of Lysias; but they are not of a kind which help to prove that the\n author was a late sophist.

Thirdly, swarms of men without cities, paupers, political exiles, malefactors, were for ever moving over the face of Greece, ready to take military service with any one who would pay them. In 401 Cyrus had found it difficult to raise ten thousand mercenaries from all Greece. In 338 ten thousand mercenaries formed a single contingent at Chaeroneia.

The  fragment of the extant letter to Dionysios is only prefatory; it appears to have been written in 368 B.C. and encourages Dionysios with the prospect of Athenian support; elsewhere he takes credit for having spoken boldly. Dionysios died in 367. Archidamos  III., who succeeded his father Agesilaos as a king of Sparta in 361, next attracted the hopes of Isokrates. The letter to Archidamos belongs probably to 356 B.C. It urges him to undertake a task to which his father Agesilaos was devoted, and in which he failed only because he tried to do two things at onceto make war on the Great King and to restore his political friends to their cities.

So far as a speculative thinker may be supposed likely to be influenced, in the way of attraction as well as of repulsion, by the actual political tone around him, Plato is a witness to this bent. Where Aristotle is describing that unique combination of gifts which belongs to the Greek racewarlike, like the continental Europeans, but of greater subtlety, keen, like the Asiatics, but with a higher\n spirithere, he says, is a race, which, if brought under one polity, might rule the world. It was under the presidency of Macedonia that Aristotle foresaw a possible renewal and a larger future for the outworn life of the Greek republics. He is said to have advised Alexander to treat the Greeks in the spirit of a leader (), and the barbarians in the spirit of a master (). The same kind of leadership which in old times had been exercised by Argos, by Athens, by Sparta, or by Thebes, was now to be vested in the person of a Macedonian King. There is nothing to show whether Aristotle had considered any probable difference between the old hegemony of a city and the new hegemony of a strong dynasty except the obvious difference that the latter was likely to be steadier. But in one sense, at all events, his dream of a boundless sway for the Greek race, when brought under one polity, came to pass. It has been too much the custom to speak of Chaeroneia as if it were something by which Grecian history was brought to an abrupt end. A crushing blow to the spirit of political freedom in the old Greek sense Chaeroneia indeed was. But it was also the beginning of a new life to replace the life so hopelessly decayedof that new empire for Greek thought and\n Greek art which opened in Macedonian times, an empire which made Greece to Asia and Europe what Athens had been to Greece, and by which Aristotle's prophecy was at last fulfilled in the world-wide and immortal dominion of which he was himself a founder."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "The view of Isokrates compared with that of Aristotle."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "title": "Lectures on Anc.

The difference between the view of Aristotle and the view of Isokrates seems to have been this. Aristotle conceived such a personal hegemony as political and permanent, without perhaps having formed to himself a definite idea of the manner in which it would affect the individual city. Isokrates conceived it as primarily military, and as assumed for the special purpose of an expedition to Asia. Absorbed in this scheme, and believing in it as a cure for all evils, he does not seem to have contemplated the probable permanency of such a leadership. But if he had been told that such permanency was a condition of the enterprise, he would unquestionably have consented. Only he would have insisted, as Aristotle did, on the distinction between leader and master. Isokrates idealized his Agamemnon of Pella; he could not read\n Philip's mind. Had he been able to read it, however, what would have grieved him would not have been the idea of an established Macedonian hegemony, but the discovery that Philip desired this more for its own sake than for the sake of the expedition to Asia.

Campaigns were longer than they used to be; war had become a profession in which amateurs were at a disadvantage; and the spirit of sacrifice for the State was extinct. A General, representing the city, commanded mercenaries. When things went wrong, the citizens at home avenged themselves directly on their representative. Hence the standing strife between the orators and the\n Generals. On the other hand, the General could keep his mercenaries together only by payment. He was obliged to turn the war, now and then, to some lucrative quarter. Burdened with this necessity, he could neither obey definite orders from home nor form any large plan for himself. His situation forced him to become more and more independent of the other States. It was natural that he should often form connexions with foreign princes on his own account. Timotheos was in alliance with Jason of Pherae, with Alketas the Molossian and with Amyntas of Macedonia. He is said to have received the towns of Sestos and Kritht as a gift from Ariobarzanes. Iphikrates was the ally of Kotys, whose sister he married and from whom he received the town of Drys in Thrace. Charidemos was the ally and brother-in-law of Kersobleptes; Chares was in alliance with Artabazos and had his residence at Sigeion; Chabrias did almost as he pleased in Egypt. Home affairs were in no better condition.  Politics had ceased to have a living interest for the best men; such men held aloof; while in the ekklesia one went and another came, and there was no one to care for the common good. There was an active and intelligent public opinion, but it had no organised or effective expression; there were cliques but there were no parties. While the higher aspects of the festivals were vanishing, the Therikon, or money given by the Treasury to the citizens to pay for their places at the theatre\n already doubled and trebled since the time of Perikleshad become the most important item of the budget. It must never be forgotten that the Theric fund meant essentially a provision for public worship and only accidentally a provision for public amusement. When Eubulos took office as Treasurer in 354, he brought in a law making it capital to propose any diversion of the Therikon to other purposes. It was the sacred character of the fund which made it possible for him to do this and so hard for Demosthenes to get it undone. On the other hand, in a religion which identified worship with festivity the merely festal spirit was sure to prevail more and more over the devotional as the general tone of the community became lower. The policy of Eubulos found favour with the people mainly because it provided them with shows. This was the true significance of the phrase used by Demdes when he called the Therikon the cement of the democracy. Eubulos was further supported by that party of commercial interests which the Essay On the Revenues of Athensascribed, but no doubt wrongly, to Xenophonrepresents with an\n almost grotesque candour. The social life which  this political life implies hardly needs to be described. On the one hand there was an intellectual world apart; on the other, there was the people, consoled for what was unsatisfactory abroad and at home by a certain provincial joviality.

Under it, citizens were not to be seen casting lots for their daily bread outside the law courts, while they paid mercenaries to fight their battlesnor choregi, splendid in golden robes, who were destined to shiver through the winter in rags. Let us return to the elder democracy of Solon and Kleisthenes, when equality meant honour where honour is due, and magistrates were not chosen by lot. Above all, let us restore to the Areiopagos its control over the education of the young and its general censorship of morals. When habits of industry are enforced, there will be no more pauperism; and when public men are forced to be respectable, the affairs of the city will go on well. Isokrates was certainly right in holding that a great need of the day was a sense of shame; though he was probably mistaken in thinking that the vices of a society such as that of the new Athens were within the reach of a censorship.

He repeated three verses from Euripidesverses commemorating three aliens who had been conquerors of GreeksDanaos,Pelops,Kadmos; and four days afterwards, on the burial-day of those who fell at Chaeroneia, he died of voluntary starvation. This dramatic picture of a violent disenchantment and a mortal despaira picture consecrated by tradition and by poetryis hard to reconcile with the repeated testimony of Isokrates himself to his own views and hopes. There is no good reason for doubting the genuineness of his Third Letter a Letter which was evidently written just after Chaeroneia, and which ends with these words: For this only do I thank old age, that of those\n early aspirations which I sought to express in my  and in my Address to you, I see part already coming to pass by your agency, and the rest, I hope, soon to come. That is to say, there was now an established leader for Greece; and there would soon be a war with Persia. Suppose, however, that the Third Letter is spurious. Still, how is the motive of the suicide to be explained? Undoubtedly Isokrates regretted the struggle between Athens and Philip; it had been brought on by a policy which he disapproved. But the result of the struggle was that the idea of his lifethe idea on which depended, as he thought, the welfare of Athens and of Greecehad become practicable. Isokrates cannot have destroyed himself because Philip had won. The conduct of Philip to Athens after Chaeroneia was studiously temperate and conciliatory; there was nothing in it to estrange Isokrates from his ideal Panhellenic chief, who, having struck one necessary blow, was now bent on healing the discords of Greece. It is more conceivable that Isokrates should have destroyed himself because he saw Athens still resolved to resist, and because he dreaded the conflict, when Philip should be at the walls, between his duty to Athens and his duty to Greece.

Cicero's powers, naturally more various, were more thoroughly brought out and far better disciplined by a life in which studious retirement alternated with public cares.

The  deals with such a subject. And even when his immediate subject concerns a particular city, the treatment is still in his own phrase, Hellenic; his point of view is not local but national. The  the  the  are instances. Now at the time when Isokrates was writing, this breadth was useful in two ways, intellectually and politically. Intellectually; for the divorce of society from the State brought with it a sharper separation between the few thinkers, who lived more and more apart, and\n the mass of the citizens, whose social life had lost the higher spiritual elements almost as completely as it could do so without ceasing to be Greek. It was a great thing that a young citizen, who perhaps would never have been drawn into the sphere of the philosophers, should have set before his mind some interests wider and higher than those suggested by the routine of business or pleasure in his own city. Besides this intellectual gain, it was especially a political gain when he was reminded that, over and above the duties of local citizenship, he owed a loyalty to the higher unity of Greece. Most men found it hard to remember this in a time when the selfishness of the individual State, or citizen, was everywhere breaking the strongest and most sacred ties of the old common life. To keep constantly the idea of Greece before the minds of men who would afterwards have power at various points of Greeceand the pupils of Isokrates came from all citieswas a good service in itself, apart from the worth of any given doctrines, and independently of the mental enlargement which it implies."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "title": "Elevation of moral tone.", "#text": "2."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "title": "Antid.", "#text": "84."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "title": "Le Discours d'Isocrate sur lui-mme", "#text": "Cartelier,  (the Antidosis) p. lxii.

But if he was not a philosophical moralist, he had a genuine respect and love for the best and highest things that he knew,\n a genuine contempt and hatred for what he felt to be mean and bad. He lived in times of which the deadly disease in public and social life was a narrow, dishonest and impudent selfishness; the spirit which animates his writings was in itself wholesome as a protest against this corrupt and abject cynicism. Isokrates has not passion; but in his eloquence one breathes a large and pure air: the fineness of his spirit has its kindred weaknesses; but, when it is truest to itself, it is marked by respect and love for all worthy sentiments; by the habit of moderation, by a just dislike for dishonest agitations; by antipathy alike for the brutal force of despots and for the brutal passions of mobs; by distance from superstition; by faithful attachment to what he called philosophyincluding under that name the double benefit of the thought whichillumines and of the speech which charms and touches lastly, by the faculty of admiration,the finest gift of his genius,and by that lively feeling for the great aspects of his country in which we can still rejoice with him.

First came technical expositions; then the learner was required to apply abstract rules in actual composition, and his essay was carefully revised by the master. Isokrates recognised fully the use of example; but while for most other teachers the setting of finished patterns before their school was almost everything, Isokrates seems to have regarded these patterns chiefly as counsels of perfection for advanced and gifted pupils; the real essence of his method consisted in developing the learner's own faculty through the learner's own efforts.

This is a fourth characteristic which distinguishes him strongly from the mass of his profession, and, in a certain degree, even from its better members. Since the end of the fifth century B. C. a literature of political pamphlets had been coming into existence; writing was now recognised as a mode of influencing public opinion on the affairs of the day. Thrasymachos pleaded for the Larisaeans, as Isokrates for the Plataeans, in a rhetorical pamphlet; in the same way Isokrates attacked, and Alkidamas defended, the new Messene. Now to Isokrates belongs the credit of trying to raise the dignity and worth of this intermittent journalism. He aimed at making his essays on contemporary events something more than telling\n pamphlets; he wished them to have a lasting value both literary and political, answering to the conscientious labour and thought which had been spent upon them. The ambition which he set steadily before his school is not simply that of rising above the forensic eloquence which triumphs for a day; it is that of producing work which shall be respectedhe says it boldlyin all companies and for all time. To be thorough; to aim at solid resultsthis rule, meant first for writers, was not less needed in that age for the future men of action; and in literature it had this special result, that literary skill, seeking some enduring form in which it might embody itself, was now applied with a new zeal to history. Three pupils of Isokrates are especially representative of this impulse. Androtion, in his , treated the local traditions and antiquities of Attica, and carried the history of Athens at least to 394 B.C. Ephoros wrote a History of Greece, in thirty books, from the Return of the Herakleidae to the siege of Perinthos by Philip in 341 B. C. Theopompos was the author of a supplement to Thucydidesrelating, in twelve books, the events from the battle of Kynossema to the battle of Knidos (411394 B. C.); and, in his , a work in no less than fifty-eight books, made Philip of Macedon the central figure of what seems to have been in fact a History of Civilization, arranged as a great picture of the contemporary world. It\n was a benefit to an age intellectually poor in all but speculative interests to have turned literary energy towards something more substantial than the study of form.

It was Isokrates who developed, though he did not originate, the idea of a literary prose-rhythm. The Greek theory distinguished a  music proper to the continuous () exertion of the voice in prose-declamation from the music of its exertion at intervals () in singing. As singing can scarcely charm the ear or make claim to beauty until it has brought itself under definite laws, partly of rhythm, partly of harmony, so oratorical prose cannot give artistic pleasure until it has become, in its proper measure, rhythmical. This implies the bringing out of that musical element which is inherent in all language; and the technical Rhetoric early began to take account of the proserhythm into which this element must be wrought. Thus Aristotle discusses the relative merits for rhetorical prose of the dactylwhich is too epic for ordinary usethe iambus, which is too common to give any distinctive effectthe trochee, which is too lightand the paeon, which he thinks on the whole the most serviceable,the first paeon () for the beginning of the period, the fourth () for the end. Poetry has its strict correspondence of rhythms and its precision of metres. Prose has its irregular rhythms and its wandering melody in the fall of syllablesrhythms and metres\n not bound by any rigid framework, yet reducible to certain general laws which the attentive ear can discover, and which the skilful speaker can apply in ever-varying combinations. Now the mistake of Gorgias had consisted in trying to bring the essentially free rhythms and metres of prose too near to the strict rhythms and metres of verse. Thrasymachos of Chalkedon was probably more judicious. But Isokrates was the earliest great artist in the rhythm proper to prose,so distinctly so, that Cicero more than once calls him its discoverer. Great artist as he was, however, he was only a developer, not a perfecter; and the chief reason why he fell short of the highest excellence seems to have been this, that he sought too constantly to base his rhythms on a certain type of composite period."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "6", "head": "The Periodic style", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Vol. I. p. 34."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "hi": {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "ib."}, "#text": "p. 166."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "how developed by Isokrates."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "title": "Dem.", "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "u(pagwgikh\\ peri/odos"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "to\\ ku/klion tw=n perio/dwn"}], "hi": [{"@rend": "ital", "#text": "meandering"}, {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "de Isocr."}], "#text": "This is the image used by Dionysios ( c. 4) to describe the , the  period, of Isokrates.

The distinctive mark of the new Isokratic period is a certain luxuriant amplitude. Instead of aiming at the vigorous compression fittest for real contests, it rejoices in rich diffusenessit unrolls itself like a clear river, luring the hearer on from bend to bend through the soft beauties of its winding course. Three kinds of period are distinguished by Demetrios: the Rhetorical, terse and round;the Conversational, slack and simple;the Historical, intermediate between these two. Lysias, as has been noticed, uses what may be called a historical period in one special part of his workin narrative parts of his public speeches. Isokrates, as a rule, uses everywhere the historical rather than the rhetorical periodgiving to it, however, a certain long and stately flow which is his own. The great fault of his management is monotony. Lysias knew at least how to brace or relax his framework; Demosthenes was a master of structural contrasts; but, in all the speeches of Isokrates, except the forensic, one long and finished period follows another with little variety or relief. He must always round his sentence. Not only the form but the matter often\n suffers for this artificial uniformity. A thought has sometimes to be diffusely, and therefore weakly, expressed, in order to afford a symmetry of clauses. But although there is this grave fault in his handling of the periodic style, it must not be forgotten that Isokrates gave a really important development to the idea of the period itself.

A trope is the use of a particular word in other than its normal senseas fire for zeal (metaphor) or steel for sword (synekdoch)to take two of the commonest tropes. A figure is an affair of whole clauses or sentences. The figure of\n language is a combination of words (each of which may be used in its normal sense) for the artificial expression of an ideaas antithesis. The figure of thought depends on no special combination of words, but on an assumed attitude of the speaker's mindas irony. Now Isokrates rarely uses tropes indeed, his avoidance of them was expressly noticed as a cause of tameness in his diction; nor with one exception to be noted presentlydoes he often use figures of thought. But he uses abundantly certain figures of language. It was Gorgias who first brought a throng of the figures of  language into Greek Rhetoric. In so far as Isokrates saw more clearly than Gorgias where the line falls between prose-rhythm and verse-rhythm, Isokrates moderated the Gorgian use of these figures. On the other hand he established some of them as the distinctive ornaments of the florid Rhetoric by developing them artistically within certain limits.

The  will supply an instance; in order to show that Philip of Macedon could easily conquer Asia, Isokrates points out that harder things were done with smaller means by Alkibiades, Konon, Dionysios and the younger Cyrus. The author of the Essay on Sublimity blames Isokrates and rightlyfor a too constant and ostentatious effort to heighten rhetorically the greatness of his theme.

Yet his practical rhetoric is not oratory. It is for\n the palaestra, not for the battle-field. It has not the stamp of vigorous nature. The great speaker in real contests holds his own argument, and can seize that of his adversary, with an iron grasp; he is impassioned and can kindle passion, he can animate the embodiment of his thought with a living soul which seems to come to it, through him, from a present and inspiring power; the artist of the schooland it is as such that Isokrates most often appearssuffers neither keenness of controversy, nor feeling, nor even what perhaps is most divine in the idea which he is enforcing, to agitate him as he marshals the slow and stately pageant of an eloquence which moves with always the same cold brilliancy. One who had tried the experiment of declaiming the discourses of Isokrates says that he had found that they would not bear delivery with raised tones, or passion, or gesture: Isokrates, he says, has dropped his voice to the key in which a slave reads aloud to his master. The disappointed reciter is too severe; but that such compositions should be better suited for reading than for declaiming is natural; and it is worthy of notice that when Isokrates himself complains of his speeches being marred by bad reading, the two points of which he deprecates the neglect are both consistent with a  mannernamely, attention to the thos (general moral tone)and attention to the cadences of the rhythm. Dionysios has been at pains to contrast a passage of the \n  ( 4150) with a passage of the  ( 2332)the contrast coming to this, that the former is a display of graces and the latter a stirring summons to action. But the fact is that it is unmeaning to compare Isokrates and Demosthenes at all. While practical oratory was parting more and more distinctly into two branchesthe pure Deliberative, best represented probably by Kallistratos, the Forensic, by Isaeos, branches of which the excellences were for once to meet in DemosthenesIsokrates was occupied apart from both in  developing a literary rhetoric, important, certainly, in its influence on the practical oratory of a later day, but of contemporary significance in the way  of style  for that Rhetorical school of history in which Ephoros and Theopompos are the earliest great names. Chieflyyet not solely. In so far as merely literary lessons have to be learned by a great speaker, Demosthenes learned much from Isokrates: but the spirit of Demosthenes was not to be bound to any rigid outward law of euphony. In the epideictic kind we can see from the Funeral Oration of Hypereides just the two points of contact between Hypereides and Isokratesthe large freedom of development, and the tone, sincere in all its rhetorical elevation, of a moralist speaking the language of panegyric. But the best\n representative of Isokrates in his influence on the  development of oratory is Cicero. Cicero was intellectually stronger than Isokrates; he had the power for real contestsliving force and passion; and the greater width of his mental horizon was not due simply to the age in which he lived. But as a stylist he is inferior to Isokrates. The idea which Cicero got from Isokrates was that of number. To this Cicero added special Isokratic graces with more than the richness but with less than the elegance of the Greek master. Seldom, perhaps, has an unconscious criticism on self told the truth more neatly than does the phrase of Cicero when he speaks of having used all the fragrant essences of Isokrates .

The invariable desire of rounding periods led to periphrasis, the craving for antitheses to a bold use of synonyms. Hence came a certain loss of that strict yet always graceful precision which had marked the best Attic, when the accurate expression of a clearly defined thought was the first thing, and the light which played over the words came through the eyes of the thought.

The growing divergence of the modern ideal from his has already, perhaps, narrowed the modern faculty of appreciating him; but most readers can still admire his power of feeling, and of honouring, what is admirable. A French scholar has observed that, in  regard to expression, the grave oratory of the preacher alone preserves for the modern world an image of that in which Isokrates excelled; and has at the same time rendered to Isokrates a tribute as high, perhaps, as the modern world could offer, in bringing proof that Isokrates had some share in forming whatever owed its virtue to form in the eloquence of Bossuet."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "12", "head": "Three representative passages", "p": {"pb": {"@n": "76"}, "title": ["Areopagitikos", "Panegyrikos", "Helen."], "#text": "Isokrates cannot be represented by extracts; the structure and the total effect are especially important for him just because he is specially an artist.

A Monarchy, as compared with a limited or with a pure Republic, has these advantages:1. It discriminates the different degrees of merit. Equality is the principle of republics. A Monarchy gives the first place to the best man, the second to the second-best, and so on ( 14, 15). 2. It has, more than other forms of government, an insight into the natures and actions of men; merit, wherever it exists, is therefore sure of recognition.3. It is the mildest of governments; since it is easier to propitiate one man than many ( 16).4. Its ministers, being not annual but permanent, learn and discharge their duties more thoroughly and composedly ( 17, 18).5. It is prompt in action. A popular assembly consists of men who are immersed in private affairs, and who meet only to wrangle: in a cabinet there are fewer distractions and delays ( 19).6. It has no jealousies. In a Republic there are always at least two parties, each of which hopes that the other will mismanage the country as grossly as possible. A monarch, having no rivals, has no spite ( 20).7. It has a more direct interest in good government. Republicans regard themselves as stewards, a monarch regards himself as the owner, of the State ( 21).8. It is more effective in war. Secret preparation, striking display, versatile intrigue, are easier for it than for other governments ( 22).", {"pb": {"@n": "92"}, "#text": "Experience shows that these advantages are not imaginary. In Persia, devotion to Monarchy has been rewarded with unequalled greatness. In Sicily, the absolutism of Dionysios has not only delivered an enslaved country, but has made it the first in Greece. Carthage and Sparta, oligarchies at home, become monarchies in the field. Athens, the most anti-monarchical of States, has generally failed when she sent out a committee of generals, and succeeded when she gave the command to one. LastlyIs not Zeus monarch of the gods? Whether the gods really live under that form of government or not, the fact of men ascribing it to them proves at least a human sense that it is the best ( 2226)."}, "Having shown the advantages of Monarchy, I will show more briefly that I am entitled to be your monarch. First, historically. Teukros, the founder of our house, brought hither the forefathers of the present Cyprians. His throne, lost for a time by his descendants, was regained by my father Evagoras, who put down Phoenician rule at Salamis and restored it to its original kings ( 27, 28). Next, personally. At my accession, I found the treasury empty, the State disturbed, Cyprus on bad terms with the rest of Greece and with Persia: and I met all these difficulties without wronging any man ( 2935).

We are accused of cruelties to Melos, Skione, Torone.

I, therefore, who am supposed to have been his adviser and teacher, cannot be silent. If he is shown to have been a bad man, let me share the blame. If he is proved to have been incomparable as a general and as a citizen, let the honour be his alone. Now, in the first place, no general ever took so many and such important cities. Corcyra, important in regard to the Peloponnesos,Samos, for Ionia,Sestos and Kritht, for the Hellespont,Potidaea, for Thrace,were taken by him with slender resources. He forced Lacedaemon\n into the present peace, the most advantageous ever concluded by Athens. In a word, he took 24 towns at a smaller outlay than the single siege of Melos cost our fathers. These exploits were achieved at a time when we were weak and our enemies strong. By what qualities did Timotheos achieve them? He was not of the ordinary type of your generals, neither of a robust frame, nor trained in the camps of mercenaries. But he knew against whom, and with whose aid, to make war; how to form, and to use, a force suitable for each attempt; how to bear privations, and to remedy them; how to win for Athens the trust and the love of Greece. A general who, like Lysander, has one brilliant success is less great than one who for years deals wisely with ever-varying difficulties. Yet Timotheos was brought to trial for treason; and, although Iphikrates took the responsibility for what had been done, Menestheus for what had been spent, they were acquitted, while Timotheos was fined in an unheard-of sum. Ignorance, envy, excitement, go far to explain this result; but it must be owned that the character of Timotheos contributed to it. He was no anti-democrat,  no misanthrope, not arrogant; but his unbending loftiness of mind made him liable to seem all this. Against my advice, he refused to conciliate the speakers who sway the ekklesia and those who direct the opinion of private circles. These men made it their business to frame falsehoods about him falsehoods which, had I space, I could bring you to see and hate. But I must go back to my own case.

When my friend said this, it seemed to me that it would be strange if any reasonable men could object to my bearing the city's burdens and yet declining its rewards. I decline its rewards not from arrogance, but from preference for a quiet life. It is not because I am very rich that I take so large a share of its burdens. No sophist has ever made a great fortune. Gorgias  of Leontini, who passed much time in Thessaly when it was the richest part of Greecewhose life was spent in seeking wealth from city to city, and who had no family burdens left only 1000 staters. The income of a sophist must not be judged by that of a popular actor. Compare me, if you will, with the most successful men in my own profession; and you will find that I have been at once a thrifty householder and a liberal citizen. ( 140158.) Things have changed at Athens since I was a boy. Then wealth was not only dignified but safe, and every one affected to be richer than he was. Now it is more dangerous to be suspected of wealth than of  the worst crime. When my fortune was wrecked in the Peloponnesian war, and I resolved to repair it by teaching, I hoped that success in my new profession would bring credit and respect.

Isokrates alludes in  141 to the seafight, and here ( 134) speaks of the blockade as existing. He says, moreover, that the king of Persia has now wasted six years in the war; which naturally means, and has always been taken to mean, that it is six years since the war began.I. Engel reconciles Diodoros with Isokrates by supposing that, with the exception of  125132 which allude to 380 B.C., the  was published in 385, just before Evagoras capitulated. The six years of Isokrates are, then, 391385, during which the war was actively prosecuted,394391 having been years chiefly of preparation. (See Rauchonstein, Introd. to  p. 21 and  above.)II.

He believes that the war began in 385, in which year Evagoras suffered his defeat at sea, and ended in 376. The six years of Isokr. are, then, 385380. The blockade of Salamis must have followed soon upon the defeat; and we have, then, to suppose a resistance of some nine years on the part of Evagoras, if, as Diodoros says, the blockade was terminated only by his surrender.III. Grote also places the  in 380. But he assigns the war to 390380 or 379. Xenophon ( IV viii. 24) mentions that an Athenian fleet was sent to the aid of Evagoras in 390 B. C. Grote relies on this fact as showing that the war between Evagoras and Persia had begun in 390. Clinton, on the other hand, thinks that this Athenian expedition, and a subsequent one in 388, related to hostilities which preceded formal war. Grote does not define the six years of Isokr.; but suggests that they may be taken either from the Peace of Antalkidas (from which, however, 380 was the  year) or from the defeat of Evagoras in 385.It seems impossiblein the absence of better datato arrive at a certain or satisfactory conclusion.

In that contest for the throne of Thrace which ensued on the death of Kotys in 359, Berisades was supported by Athenodoros, as Kersobleptes by Charidemos, and Amadokos by Simon and Bianor. The position of Athenodoros at that time (359 357) would have been one of sufficient influence to enable him to become founder (oekist) of a new town, though he was merely an , i.e. neither a prince nor the official representative of a city.

This watch was maintained over the daily life even of adults, and was aided by the division of the town into wards, of the country into demes. The Supreme Court knew well that two things chiefly restrain crime; probability of detection and certainty of punishment.

But, in this case, the defendant is poorer, and a better speaker, than the plaintiff.

The strongest presumption for the defendant's guilt may be found in the time of the transaction. Under the Thirty, Euthynus was all-powerful. Nikias, merely on account of his wealth, was exposed to danger. Thus Timodemos extorted 30 minae from him by the simple threat of arresting him. At such a time, it is more likely that he should have been a victim than a slanderer ( 11 15). Euthynus will perhaps say that it is unlikely that he should have repaid two talents and withheld the third. It was just the foreseen plausibility of this argument which emboldened him. Judicious frauds of this kind are common; they ought not to be encouraged by the acquittal of Euthynus. Besides, the same argument will serve Nikias. Why, if he wished to extort money, should he not have claimed all three talents? No fraudulent motive can be assigned for his demanding only one. But the motive of Euthynus in repaying two is clear. It was notorious that Nikias had deposited a sum of money with him; but the amount of that sum was unknown. He saw, therefore, that it would be safe for him to steal a part of it, but unsafe to steal the whole ( 16 21)."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pro\\s *eu)qu/noun a)ma/rturos"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "o( a)ma/rturos"}], "#text": "Entitled in the MSS. , and cited by Philostratos simply as ."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Remarks."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "title": "Vit.

I came to Athens, partly for pleasure, partly for business, having been sent out with two cornships by my father, who is governor of a large district, under Satyros, prince of Bosporos. I was introduced to Pasion and opened an account with him. Meanwhile my father had been arrested by Satyros on suspicion of treason. Some men from the Euxine who were at Athens received the orders of Satyros to take possession of all my property and to send me home. In this difficulty I consulted Pasion and decided to give up a small sum to the agents of Satyros, but to deny the existence of the larger sums which I had lying in Pasion's bank. To help the deception, Pasion was to represent me, not only as having no balance, but as owing money to himself and others. Having arranged matters with the agents of Satyros, I prepared to set out upon my homeward voyage, and applied to Pasion for my money. He told me that he had not the means of\n refunding it just then. I then sent to him my friends Philomelos and Menexenos; and to them he repudiated the debt altogether ( 310)."}, "Presently news came that my father was restored to the favour of Satyros. Pasion, aware that there was now no longer any reason why legal proceedings should not be openly taken against him, hid his slave Kittos, who knew the truth. When Menexenos demanded that Kittos should be given up, Pasion retorted that we ourselves had made away with him, after bribing him to give us money from the bank. Presently, however, Kittos was found in Athens by Menexenos, who then demanded that he should be given up by Pasion for torture. Pasion at first asserted that Kittos was a freeman. Subsequently, however, he consented to submit him to the question: but, when we met for that purpose, refused to allow torture to be applied ( 1116).", "Finding that his conduct was blamed by everyone, he next sought a private interview with me. He pleaded poverty as the cause which had forced him to deny the debt. He then gave me a bond that he would accompany me to the Euxine and there pay the moneythus avoiding a scandal at Athens. The bond, which stipulated that, if we could not come to an agreement, Satyros should arbitrate, was placed in the hands of Pyron of Pherae, a merchant in the Euxine trade. In the event of an amicable settlement, he was to burn it; otherwise, to place it in the hands of Satyros ( 1720).", "Meanwhile Menexenos had upon his own account brought an action for libel against Pasion. Pasion was now terrified lest Menexenos should get hold of our bond. He implored my mediation, which I refused. Desperate, he bribed the slaves of Pyron, and found means of tampering with the bond. He then became defiant, and refused to go with me to the Euxine or to pay the money. When the bond was opened before witnesses, it was found to release Pasion from all claims on my part ( 2123).", {"pb": {"@n": "225"}, "#text": "Pasion will rely much on this forged document. That it is a forgery, is evident (1) from the terms of the\n document itself; (2) from the absence of motive on my part for giving such a release; (3) from my daring to come into court now; (4) from Pasion's eagerness, before he had tampered with the bond, to have it cancelled. Such frauds are common. Last year, Pythodorus, a friend of Pasion, opened the balloting-urn of the Senate, and changed the names of those who had been nominated as judges in the festal contests.

Among other things which disprove this is the fact that he himself became security for me in seven talents when a vessel upon which I had lent money was denounced as being the property of a Delian, and was in danger of being put to death untried. In a word,which is more probablethat, at a moment when I was helpless, I should have brought a false charge against Pasion, or that he should have been emboldened to defraud me?

Formerly I urged you to bring about concord in Hellas by reconciling the chief states, Athens, Sparta, Thebes, Argos. Now, persuasion is no longer needed. The recent struggle has proved them to have no will but yours, and to admit that the war which they have been making upon each other ought to be turned against Asia. They ask me whether the idea of an expedition against the barbarians was originally yours or mine; and when I say that, to the best of my belief, it was yours, they entreat me to confirm you in it. No deed, they say, could be nobler, better for Hellas, or more timely. ( 23.) Had not my powers utterly failed, I would have come to you and urged this in person. In one thing it is good to be insatiablein the desire of true glory; and your glory will be perfect only when you have  made the barbarians helots to the Greeks. To that result it will be an easier step than it was from the first to the present stage of your power. That result gained, nothing will remain for you but to become a god.

Some infer from extant notices, direct and indirect, that Isokrates really published a systematic Art. The direct notices are, with one exception, of slight interest. They inform us that Isokrates defined Rhetoric as the science of persuasion, insisted, in reference to forensic speaking, on the importance of taking up a strong position in that general statement of a case () which precedes the detailed narrative of facts, as well as on the need of comprehensiveness in the narrative () itself;\n and observed on the dislike of Atticists to coining new words. The only citation more precise and satisfactory than these is made by Maximus Planudes. We learn, he says, from the  of Isokrates what kind of diction is called pure; for that writer has been so attentive to purity of style as to give in his own treatise such precepts as these upon the subject:In composition, vowels must not clash, for that has a lame effect; nor is it well to begin and end with the same syllable, as ; or to put the same conjunctions close together, making the latter answer immediately to the former.

Unlike Antiphon or Andokides, unlike even Lysias or Isokrates, Isaeos, so far as is known, had no definite relation, literary or active, with the affairs of Athens. Nothing could better illustrate the workings of that deep change which was passing over the life of Athens and of Greece.

About 509 B. C., after an Athenian victory over the Chalkidians, the lands of the  Chalkidian Hippobotae, or Knights, had been shared among four thousand Athenian kleruchs. If the family of Isaeos was descended from one of these settlers, the account which represents Isaeos as an Athenian by descent would be justified, and the fact that the name Diagoras, attributed to his father, is not Athenian, would be explained.

But the only master to whom Isaeos is given as pupil by a tradition at once definite and trustworthy is Isokrates. Their intercourse may be referred to  the years 393390, when Isokrates was just beginning to teach, or when Isaeos was about to enter on\n his own career as a writer of speeches for the lawcourts. Both these factsthat the teacher's manner was not matured, and that the discipleship must have been comparatively shortmay help to explain why Isaeos kept so few traces of Isokratic expression. As we shall see, however, the Isokratic influence on Isaeos may clearly be traced in another provincein his handling of subject-matter. Isokrates asserts that, of all the numerous writers of speeches for the courts, no one was ever honoured with pupils. If Isaeos had been the pupil of Lysias, at least one  notable exception would have been established.

These Private Causes were, moreover, principally of the class with which Demosthenes also was so much engaged, and for which Isokrates reserves his principal contempt,claims to property or money between man and man.

Now, in 366, Isaeos must have been known for upwards of twenty years as a successful writer of forensic speeches, and also as a master of Attic law, especially in the department of claims to property. No one could be better fitted to arm Demosthenes for his first encounter. There is no doubt whatever that Demosthenes had recourse to the aid of Isaeos. Afterwards, when that relative obscurity in which the critics left the elder orator was hardly broken save by this stray gleam from the glory of the younger, friendly biographers naturally welcomed everything that could add brightness to the borrowed ray. It is due quite as much to Isaeos as to Demosthenes that we should be on our guard against exaggerations. According to one story, Demosthenes, on coming of age, took Isaeos into his house, and studied with him for four years. He is further said to have paid Isaeos 10,000 drachms (about 400) on condition that the\n teacher should withdraw from a school of Rhetoric which he had opened, and should devote himself wholly to his new pupil. It was a close personal relation, writes a brilliant historian, into which they entered, an intellectual armed alliance, in order with their united strength to carry on the contest of vengeance which Demosthenes, like the Heroes of ancient mythology, undertook against the desolaters of his paternal home. It would be agreeable thus to conceive Isaeos,as a Pylades divided by nothing but, perhaps, thirty-six years from his young partner in the chastisement of a triple Aegisthos. Plutarch, however, says merely that Demosthenesemployed Isaeos as his master in Rhetoric, though Isokrates was then teaching, either (as some say) because he could not pay Isokrates the prescribed fee of ten minae; or because he preferred the style of Isaeos for his purpose, as being vigorous and astute ().

Then another version claims for Isaeos the credit of having taught Demosthenes gratis. But the decisive argument is furnished by the speeches Against Aphobos and Onetor. These are not the compositions of one who had given himself wholly to the guidance of Isaeos, who was sitting at the master's feet, who was working under the master's eye. On the contrary, these earliest speeches of Demosthenes have a stamp of their own as marked as it is original.

In a general view of his career, we are  irresistibly struck with a resemblance and a contrast.

Each was deeply versed, not only in rhetoric, but in law; each, too, was eminent in a branchAntiphon in the law of homicide, Isaeos in the law of property. Each used his art for his client, not, indeed, without some attempt at persuasive simplicity, but with a masterful force which rendered the attempt little more than a tribute to usage. Each had a sinister reputation; Antiphon lay under the suspicion of the people through a repute for cleverness, and never came before the people when he could help it; Isaeos, too, was deemed clever in elaborating pleas for the worse part, and, with the exception of the Greek Argument to his Oration On the Estate of Nikostratosand that Argument is a worthless authoritythere is no evidence that he ever spoke in a law-court. Each was the object of a public satire which reflected this unpopularity; Antiphon figured in the  of Plato Comicus, Isaeos in the  of Theopompos. But, if thus far the personal analogy is close, there is a strange divergence of fates beyond it. Antiphon worked patiently, indeed, at his disliked and suspected calling through long years of judicious\n abstention from every battle-field of the civic life. But his climax was political; the strife of parties was the focus on which his disciplined powers were finally concentrated; and when the keen weapon which had so often served others was at last bared in his own hand, it was for no single combat, but for the encounter of oligarchy with democracy, for a struggle which filled Athens with bitterness, as it drowned his own life in blood. Isaeos, subtle and patient, but not, like Antiphon, passionate also, was congenially placed in days when an Athenian had ceased to be primarily a citizen. The early application of rhetorical art to politicsso natural, even so necessary, yet so crudehad long given place to a conception of the rhetorical province in which politics made only one department. With this department Isaeos recognisedprobably with the indifference of the timethat he had nothing to do; the intellectual ardour which he clearly had was of a kind that his tasks at once satisfied and limitedmaking it enough for him to live and die the laborious, successful, rather unpopular master of Attic Law; not the first at Athens who had followed a calling, but perhaps the earliest Athenian type of a professional man."}}]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "20", "head": "Isaeos:  Style", "div2": [{"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "head": "The judgement of Dionysios", "p": [{"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "title": "Isae.", "#text": "Dionys.  c. 19."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Distinction of Isaeos, according to Dionysios."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "title": "Isae.", "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "o(/ti moi dokei= th=s *dhmosqe/nous deino/thtos, h(\\n ou)qei/s e)stin o(\\s ou) teleiota/thn a(pasw=n oi)/etai gene/sqai, ta\\ spe/rmata kai\\ ta\\s a)rxa\\s ou(=tos o( a)nh\\r parasxei=n"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "th=| deino/thti th=s kataskeuh=s"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "phgh/ tis"}], "hi": {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "ib."}, "#text": "Dionys.  20, .

Lysias is the representative of those who cultivate terse, closelyreasoned discourse with a view to real contests, deliberative or forensic; and, having made a study of Lysias, he has felt himself exempted from discussing in detail the austere Antiphon, the frigid, inane and ungraceful Polykrates, the correct and subtle Thrasymachos, who, though inventive and forcible, is still a merely scholastic writer, the artificial Kritias and Zoilos, to whom, in different ways, the same general observation would apply. Isokrates, again, stands for all who have succeeded in the poetical, the elevated and stately manner; and, in like sort, absolves the critic from discussing\n Gorgias, who lapses from moderation and is everywhere childish; Alkidamas, his pupil, who is somewhat coarse; Theodoros of Byzantium, whose technical inaccuracies are not adequately compensated by ability, deliberative or forensic, and who, moreover, is antiquated; Anaximenes of Lampsakos, who aims at completeness, who would fain stand foursquare to rivalries from every quarter, but who, in every kind, is weak and devoid of persuasive charm; or, lastly, those contemporary imitators of Isokrates, in regard to expression, who are confessedly his inferiors, such as Theodektes, Naukrates, Philistos, Kephisodoros, Ephoros, Theopompos. But what or whom does Isaeos represent except himself? Might not he, if any man, he, an exclusively forensic writer, and that in the plain manner, he, the close student and direct imitator of Lysias, have been taken as characterised when Lysias had been criticised?

Lysias was, however, fond of antithesis; and the result is that, while his composition as a whole has variety, the structure of his periods themselves is apt to be too stiff and uniform.

The composition of Isaeos tends to keep the hearer's mind at strain by a continual sense, not merely of earnestness, but of trained and confident skill; it cannot be quite content to forego the advantage resigned by Demosthenes and the great deliberative speakers of seeming comparatively artless; at the same time, its own eager strength renders it profoundly incapable of suppressing tones which are militant and aggressive. It is important to see clearly the general distinction between the two orators;that, while Lysias is secure in a modest art of his own, Isaeos is halting between this indirect art, in which he is too sophisticated and morally not fine enough really to excel, and the direct, masterly art of eloquence to which he has not perfectly attained."}}, {"@type": "subsection", "@n": "3", "head": "Proems of Lysias and Isaeos compared.", "p": [{"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "title": ["De Isaeo", "Prefatory Discourse"], "hi": {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "ethical"}, "#text": "The three pairs of proems which follow are given by Dionysios , cc. 511, in this order.(1) c. 5, Isaeos For Eumathes, c. 6, Lysias For Pherenikos; c. 7, comments.

A figure of language is a combination of words for the artificial expression of an ideaas by antithesis. The object of such a figure is rhetorical ornament; and, if the form of expression is changed, the figure of language is destroyed. A figure of thought consists in the suggestion of an idea which is itself artificial, having for its object, not ornament, but thos or pathos moral persuasion or the excitement of emotion. If the speaker prefaces a statement by asking the question which he is himself about to answer: if he feigns perplexity for the sake of giving the greater effect to his own solution: if, instead of relating what other persons have said, he introduces those persons as speaking with their own mouths: if he imagines his adversaries as raising an objection which he goes on to refutethese and the like devices are figures of thought. Unlike the figures of language, these figures of thought are independent of any form of words; the form of words may be changed without affecting them. Their general tendency\n is to give animation. The elder school of Attic oratory was too grave and too stately to admit this animation; Antiphon, who uses the figures of language sparingly, uses the figures of thought hardly ever. That Andokides uses the figures of thought so much, is a strong mark of his comparative modernism and of his detachment from the art of his day. Lysias, the founder of a style free from the old rigour, had a reason of his own for still using the figures of thought with moderation, namely, because they are too suggestive of thrust and parry, and, though they may serve thos, tend to mar the special thos at which he chiefly aimed, since they present the speaker too much as a combatant. Isaeos, while still desirous of a persuasive plainness, is also bent on exerting the essential vigour of his art. He has no longer, then, the same motive as Lysias for declining aids to vivacity or even vehemence; and accordinglywhile he usually avoids the figures of languagehe uses the figures of thought with a freedom which brings him decidedly\n nearer than any of his predecessors to the practice of their greatest master, Demosthenes.

Here the adversaries (1) denied that the testator had adopted a son, (2) asserted that he had sons of his body; and there is a corresponding division of the narrative into two distinct parts ( 57,  1842), with the proofs subjoined. Will-cases would often, of course, involve such a long and intricate narrative; it would be difficult or impossible for the judges to follow the chapters of an argument detached from the corresponding chapters of facts; but Isaeos, in obeying a necessity, made it a virtue, and carried to a high perfection the combination of luminous recital with perspicuous reasoning. Reading the narratives of Lysias, says Dionysios, one would suppose that nothing was said artificially or insidiously, but everything in accordance with the dictates of nature and of truth,forgetting that the imitation of nature was the chief task of his art. The narratives of Isaeos are apt to give the opposite sensation, and to make one fancy that nothing is spontaneous or unpremeditated, even when things are related as, in fact, they happened. All seems the result of artifice; all seems contrived to deceive, or to secure some sort of underhand advantage. Lysias will be believed even when he lies; Isaeos will not be heard without suspicion even when he tells the truth. Dionysios greatly over\n colours the contrast,as he sometimes does through that solicitude for the meanest capacity which belongs to his eager and genial interpretation; but the main point is clearthe consummate and victorious art which he finds in the narrative of Isaeos. Now here we may almost certainly recognise a practical lesson which Isaeos owed to Isokrateswhose teaching in the matter of expression had influenced him so little.

By , Aristotle meant a  rhetorical syllogism: that is, a syllogism drawn, not from the premisses () proper to any particular sciencesuch, for instance, as medicinebut from propositions relating to contingent things in the sphere of human action, which are the common property of all discussion; propositions which he classifies as general () and particular (); and accordingly  an enthymeme as a\n syllogism from probabilities and signs. A misapprehension of Aristotle's meaning had, as early as the first century B.C., led to the conception of the enthymeme as not merely a syllogism of a particular subject-matter, but also as a syllogism . The term  was then brought in to denote a rhetorical syllogism which is stated in fullan essay to deal thoroughly with the issue at stake. Dionysios means, then, that Lysias is content with a sketching style of proof, a proof which is not formally complete, whereas Isaeos, aiming at a precise development, goes through every step of his argument. In other phrases\n of Dionysios himself, Lysias proves briefly and generally,Isaeos, at length, and accurately (). The difference between  epicheireme and enthymeme is well exemplified in the seventh speech. The question is whether Apollodoros, the testator, had really adopted the speaker. The speaker first proves the adoption by direct testimony, and then says that he will bring, further, some indirect testimony. At this stage, Lysias would probably have been content with an enthymeme to the following effect:Thrasybulos, the nephew of the female claimant, has made no claim, though his right is better than hers. Isaeos, however, will be satisfied with nothing less than a systematic and rigorous demonstration. Eupolis had two daughters,the claimant, and another, who has left a son. Now there is, indeed, a law which gives brother and sister equal claim to the estate of a brother. But, where the kinship is less near, men precede women. Hence, if the adoption is invalid, this daughter of Eupolis has no claim, while her nephew, Thrasybulos, has a right to all. But Thrasybulos has raised no claim. Presumably, therefore, he recognises the adoption as valid. Isaeos, as Sir William Jones well says, lays close siege to the understandings of the jury. His reasonings, generally based on positive law, are constraining even when they are not persuasive. Often, again, an\n argument is founded on the feeling or conduct of the testator towards the speaker and the adversary respectively: on the conduct of the adversary, as being inconsistent with his assumption: on the services rendered by the speaker's client to the deceased or to the State: on the demerits of the adversary as regards general character, on his omission to perform public services, or on his anxiety to obtain the estate while he is content that the testator's house should be left desolate. The example which the Greek critic selects is, for us, the only considerable specimen of the orator's work in a cause not testamentary.

You will find that all who act thus\n are constrained either by the want of trueborn sons or by poverty, hoping for benefits from the persons who by their means have become Athenians. Neither condition applies to our father. He has, in us, two legitimate sons, so that childlessness could not have prompted the adoption. Nor, again, did he look to Euphiletos for maintenance or wealth; he has substance enough; further, it has been deposed before you that he maintained the plaintiff from infancy, educated him, enrolled him in his clan and these are no light expenses. Our father, then, was not likely, judges, to attempt anything so unjust when it could do him no good. Nor, again, will I be suspected of such madness as bearing false witness for the plaintiff in order to have my patrimony divided among a larger number. Hereafter, of course, I could not for a moment dispute the relationship; no one of you would endure the sound of my voice, if I, who now, standing in peril of the law, testify that he is our brother, should be found contradicting that statement. The probability is, judges, that true testimony has been borne, not only by us, but by the other kinsmen too. Reflect, in the first place, that the husbands of our sisters would never have perjured themselves in the cause of the plaintiff: his mother was the stepmother of our sisters, and somehow stepmothers and the daughters of a former marriage are wont to disagree: so that, if the plaintiff had been our stepmother's son by another than our father, our sisters, judges, would never have allowed their husbands to be witnesses. Again:our maternal uncle, being, of\n course, no relation of the plaintiff, would not have gratified the plaintiff's mother by making a false deposition fraught with the manifest injury to us involved in our adoption of a stranger as our brother. Further, judges, how could any of you impute perjury to Demaratos, who stands there, or to Hegesippos, or Nikostratosmen whose whole lives will show a stainless record, and who, being our intimate friends and knowing us all, have severally testified their kinship with Euphiletos?"}, "I should be glad, then, to learn from the most respected of our adversaries whether he could establish his Athenian citizenship by any other proofs than those which we have brought for Euphiletos. For my part, I do not think he could do more than show that both his parents are Athenians, and adduce the testimony of his relatives to the truth of that assertion. Then again, judges, supposing our adversaries were in peril, they would expect you to believe their friends rather than their accusers; as it is, though we have all that testimony on our side, shall they require you to put faith in their own story rather than in Euphiletos, in me and my brother, in our clansmen, in our entire family?

If this is not enough, judges, I was thirteen years old, as I said before, when Euphiletos was born, and I am ready to swear that Euphiletos is the son of my father. Justly then, judges, might you deem our oaths more trustworthy than the adversaries' assertions; we are willing to make oath on a matter of which we have accurate knowledge, while they retail hearsay from the plaintiff's ill-wishers, or inventions of their own. We, moreover, bring our kinsmen as witnesses before you as before the arbitrators,witnesses who have a claim to be believed; while, since Euphiletos brought his first suit against the corporation and its demarch now deceased, the adversaries have failed to find any evidence that he is not my father's son, though the case was before the arbitrator for two years. To the conductors of the arbitration these facts afforded the strongest presumption of falsehood, and both of them decided against the adversaries.(Read the evidence of the former award.)You have heard that the former arbitration went against them. I claim, judges, that just as the adversaries would have urged an award favourable to themselves in evidence of Euphiletos not being the son of Hegesippos, so the opposite result should now be testimony to the truth of our story, since they were adjudged guilty of having erased the name of Euphiletos, an Athenian citizen, after it had been duly registered.

The estimate agrees\n substantially with the judgment of Hermogenes, delivered in his own technical dialect:In Isaeos,  besides the other things which constitute Political Oratory in the proper sense (i.e. Forensic and Deliberative speaking), the element of  is large,bringing him near, indeed, to the noblest type of civil eloquence.

That power which is shown in  is considerable in Isaeos,but less than in Lysias. The last remark might seem disputable; for, as Dionysios truly says, Isaeos greatly excels Lysias in arrangement (): by method, however, Hermogenes means the faculty of seizing the proper moment for each oratorical artifice; and his estimate, therefore, amounts to thisthat Isaeos, compared with Lysias, is superior in , but inferior in  The result, obtained by too rigid and mechanical a process, is incomplete; but it is interesting for its careful and respectful estimate of an orator whom (with the great exception of Dionysios) the criticism of the Roman age neglected; and it is not, so far as it goes, incorrect."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "8", "head": "Isaeos and Lysias Summary.", "p": {"pb": {"@n": "300"}, "#text": "In diction, Isaeos has, then, like Lysias, purity,\n conciseness, clearness, simplicity and vividness; in composition, while still aiming at plainness, he uses, on the whole, a more open and more vigorous art, and has, if not less ethical power, less of ethical charm; he abstains, like Lysias, from the more elaborate figures of language, but uses far more largely the figures of thought: in regard to subject-matter, his arrangement is not, like that of Lysias, uniform, but varies with each case, and is especially marked by the frequent interfusion of proof with narrative, and by the completeness with which the proof is worked out."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "9", "head": "Isaeos and Demosthenes.", "p": {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Criticism of Dionysios subject to a reserve."}, "pb": {"@n": "301"}, "#text": "Now let us ask what is the meaning of that statementso brief, so general, yet so strikingly emphaticin which Dionysios embodies his reason for regarding the work of Isaeos, not as a mere result of Lysias, but as possessing a substantive and permanent interest.

The first point to observe is that, besides such special limitations of this statement as Dionysios himself elsewhere furnishes, there is a general qualification which from the outset we must supply for ourselves. Like other ancient critics  less excellent in detail than he, Dionysios tends to test the criticism of oratory too much on literary grounds. To one who reads Lysias, Isaeos and Demosthenes successively, it must be manifest that, in certain important respects of literary development, Isaeos stands between the other two.

A host of private speeches, not his, are given to him in the collection of Kallimachos. But, to take those only of which the genuineness is tolerably certain, we have proof that he wrote for private causes from 361 to  345 B.C. After the two speeches Against Aphobos in 363 and the two Against Onetor in 362, we have, probably in 361, the speech Against Spudias (XLI.) and the speech Against Kallikles (LV.); in 356 (probably) the speech Against Konon (LIV.); in 352, the speech For Phormio (XXXVI.); in 350, the speech Against Boeotos concerning the Name (XXXIX.); in 345, the speech Against Pantaenetos (XXXVII.), and probably the speech Against Nausimachos (XXXVIII.). But, meanwhile, he had another occupation, a higher,\n and one which, for him, made a stepping-stone to the highest. During the years 355350 B.C. he was concerned with four public causesAgainst  Androtion, Against Leptines, Against Timokrates, Against Aristokrates,the object in each case being to obtain the repeal of a new decree or law which had been carried by corrupt influences and which was dangerous to the public interests. Each of these four speeches is at once an interpretation of positive right and a vindication of political morality a protest against the civic apathy which was suffering the resources of the State to be crippled, its powers to be abused for personal ends, its safeguards against foreign foes to be broken down. The same five years saw Demosthenes enter on that  direct participation in public life for which this concernment with public causes formed a preparation; his speech On the Navy Boards was delivered in 354, the First Philippic in 351. Thus, while continuing to exercise the profession of Isaeos, Demosthenes had already passed through a second phase of activity, and had even made trial of that crowning sphere in which the great work of his life was to be done. Almost from the first, therefore, Demosthenes  exerted his force under more liberal conditions than those prescribed by the narrow scope of the writer for private causes; almost from the first his natural intensity was free to ally itself with the oratorical\n bent of the age, and, instead of refining on the art which hides itself, to wield the art which triumphs and commands.

Since the time when Kleon described that keen and brilliant fencing in the ekklesia at which the majority of the citizens delighted to assist as at a spectacle, the fitness for such encounter had been becoming more and more important to deliberative oratory: but its peculiar sphere was forensic, and in that sphere Isaeos was its earliest master.

It has been shown beyond reasonable doubt that the idea of a man's legal existence being prolonged in his heir, or in a group of co-heirs, sprang from the attribution to the individual of that perpetuity which is the characteristic of the family. The idea of  continuing the family is that in which the testament begins. Now, in primitive societies, religious rites are the symbols and warrants of the family's continuity. The father of the Indo-European house was its priest as well as its master: the sacrifices which, in life, he offered at the hearth could, after his death, be offered only by the son in whom his personality survived. These sacrifices were at once the most solemn obligations of his successor and the most sacred pledges of an inviolable succession. What, then, was to happen if there was no heir duly qualified by nearness in blood? To meet  this case, primitive society invented Adoption, that is, the authorized fiction of kinship. The faculty of adoption was the germ of testamentary power. But there is no proof that any ancient society, except the Roman, got beyond the faculty of adoption to a true power of testation. The Athenian Will  was only an inchoate Testament. Permission to execute a will was first given to Athenian citizens by the laws of Solon. But it was expressly restricted\n to those citizens who had no direct male descendants. Those illustrations of Athenian testamentary succession which are supplied by the speeches of Isaeos have one general characteristic of striking interest, and it is in this, more than in the light which they throw on Attic details, that their great and lasting value resides. The Hindoo system of succession shows  the primitive religious element completely predominant. When the childless Hindoo adopts a child, it is with a view to the funeral cake, the water, and the solemn sacrifice. The Roman testamentary  law of Cicero's time, on the other hand, has broken free of religion; the  have passed under the separate jurisdiction of the Pontifical College; the obligation imposed by the Civil Law has become independent of the theological sanction. The Athenian  system belongs essentially to the same stage as the Hindoo system. It has not, like the Roman law of Cicero's time, passed that point of development at which testation proper begins. But, in spirit, the  Athenian system, may be regarded as intermediate between the Hindoo and the Roman. The Athenian exercise of adoptive power retains, indeed, as its nominal first principle, the religious continuity of the family. Succour him who is with the dead, cries the speaker to the jurors,do not allow him\n I beseech you by the gods and the immortal spirits to be treated with contumely by these men: think, he exclaims, for what you will become responsible if you are persuaded by Kleon to give a different verdict:first of all, you will send the worst enemies of Astyphilos to celebrate the rites at his grave. It would be an utter mistake to suppose that these pathetic or stately commonplaces are altogether hollow. The sentiment is real enough. But, at the same time, there is a difference between the Hindoo and the Athenian feeling. The Hindoo adopts a son  in order that his departed spirit may enjoy higher spiritual benefits than it could enjoy if the offerings at the grave were made by a relative less near than a son. The Athenian of the days of Isaeos adopted a son  because he wished to leave his property to a person who would not otherwise get it. For the Hindoo, that religious motive in which adoption originated is still foremost. For the Athenian of the days of Isaeos, the faculty of adoption, though necessarily associated with religion, is chiefly significant in its civil aspect, as a limited form of testamentary power."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "4", "head": "Athenian rules of inheritance.", "p": [{"pb": {"@n": "318"}, "#text": "The following are the chief rules which, at Athens, governed succession and bequest:"}, "I.

Besides, a mere correction or addition might have been made on a new tablet; by sending for the original document Kleonymos showed that he desired some substantial alteration (2426).

Such monotony might certainly be forgiven to a series of illustrations so valuable for a province of ancient law, showing, as they do, how the practice of Adoption worked in a society now developed beyond the conceptions in which that limited testation begins,\n though not yet arrived at the ideas embodied in the civil law of Rome. If, however, we turn from  matter to form, the character of the speeches is not monotony but variety. In the first, the second and the ninth oration, we have reproduced, in no slight measure, the dignified and austere pathos of Antiphon. In the seventh and twelfth, there is much of the thos, the attractive simplicity and winning grace of Lysias; while in the third, the sixth, the eighth, and the eleventh, on the other hand, this moral charm is hardly less conspicuous by its absence. Excellences of narrative are prominent in the second, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh speech. Argument excludes everything else in the third. The fourth oration surprises us with something like the lighter humour of Lysias, if only in a single gleam.  But, of the twelve, there are three which stand out from all the rest, and which, taken together, symbolize their author's place in the progress of Athenian oratory. The fifth is Lysian, the eleventh is Demosthenic, the eighth is distinctively Isaean. The fifth recalls Lysias by the graceful and persuasive management of the narrativefor here argument has a subordinate partby the general simplicity of the language, and not less by the skill which, in the epilogue, indulges itself with pointed and lively antithesis. The eleventh, renouncing everything like a semblance of artlessness, glorying, rather, in technical power, pours a torrent of indignation and contempt on an adversary who is in the wrong; and,\n alone among the speeches of Isaeos, has the stamp of Demosthenes in this, that from beginning to end it is the outcome of a single impulse. But the eighth oration is Isaeos himself; it is the very image of his faculty, displaying its several sides at their best, the old plainness with the modern force, artistic narrative with trenchant proof; and these, too, in the right proportions, for here the logical division dominates the rhetorical, and the department in which Isaeos was an imitator yields to that in which he was a master."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "11", "head": "Fragments.", "p": [{"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "title": "Or.

When, with Demosthenes and his contemporaries, deliberative oratory first comes clearly into view, its masters are found to owe their several excellences as artists to models taken from the other  two departments, to a Thucydides or an Isokrates, to a Lysias or an Isaeos. Not only have we no evidence of their obligation, in point of art, to previous speakers in the same kind, but we are able to see for ourselves that the limits of such obligation would necessarily have been narrow. Now this is the reverse of what might have been anticipated. The ekklesia, considering its place in the democracy, might have been expected to be the great school, no less than the great field, of oratory. Further, the popular Dialectic, which, more than anything else, prepared the Athenian taste for artistic speaking, was far more favourable to the deliberative than to the forensic branch. The general profession of the\n Sophists was to teach men , to speak and to act in the affairs of the city. Protagoras would have regarded the Sicilian rhetors, such as Korax or Tisias, whose concern was chiefly with the law-courts, much as Isokrates regarded the merely forensic writers of his own day. Nor did the earliest artists cultivate one practical branch to the exclusion of the other. Antiphon was able to help those who were fighting a cause in a law-court  in the assembly. The thirty-fourth oration of Lysias was composed for delivery in the ekklesia. Nevertheless it was not in the assembly, but in the law-courts or the schools, that oratorical prose was developed; and, when we are able to observe the political eloquence of Athens at its height, we see that what it has owed to the assembly is only the inspiring opportunity, not the discipline which has chastened it nor the secret of its strength."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "2", "head": "Why oratory develops in the law-courts", "p": {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Reasons for this:"}, "#text": "It is worth while to consider the principal causes  of this phenomenon.

This Rhetoric grew only gradually into a complete system; but from the first there was the fixed tendency to regard oratorical\n composition as susceptible of a regular analysis. Now, those rules of technical Rhetoric which were the earliest to be formulated could be applied with more precision and more effect in a speech for the law-courts than in a speech for the ekklesia. The true reason of this is not that given derisively by Aristotle, that, in forensic speaking, chicanery () has the larger scope; the reason is that, in forensic speaking, the subject is fully and accurately known beforehand to the speaker; the utmost clearness of division is imperative, and is obtainable by a uniform method; and the problem is, how best to use all the resources of persuasion in a limited space of time. The two things to which the technical Rhetoric first addressed itself were, partition, and the treatment of probabilities.

The stock of the Eteobutadae, claiming to spring from Erechtheus, were hereditary priests of Poseidon Erechtheus; from their house, too, was chosen the priestess of Athena Polias; and their services to the State, recognised for generations by public honours in life and in death, were thus enhanced by the most sacred dignities that Athens could revere.

By restoring the festivals of the gods, by cherishing a faithful tradition of the great poets, by enacting sumptuary laws, and, above all, by facing the bitterly invidious task of prosecuting disloyal citizens, he made his name to be, like that of Drakon, a symbol for severity; probably with better reason, certainly in a more urgent cause.

Besides imitating the merits of Demosthenes in everything except composition, Hypereides has further mastered in an eminent degree the excellences and the graces of Lysias. He expresses himself in the plain manner, where it is fitting,not with the sustained, unvarying tension of Demosthenes; and he has moral persuasiveness, with the flavour of an unstudied suavity. Incomparable wit plays about him; his sarcasm is in perfect keeping with political oratory; he is adroit with the weapons of irony; his jokes are not jarring, ill-bred, or importunate, in the Attic manner of that generation; when he does pull people to pieces, he does it neatly, with much humour, and with the pungency of well-aimed banter; and with all this, there is a beauty of style beyond imitation. He has great power of pathos; in relating legends, he has a certain luxuriance, and a facile inspiration that wafts him most smoothly from point to point on his way;for instance, he has managed Leto's story more artistically than any one\n else; and, in the Funeral Oration, has perhaps surpassed all in the panegyric manner. Demosthenes, on the other hand, has no gift for delineation of character; his style is not liquid, flexible, or adapted to display; and he is comparatively deficient in each and all of the qualities just mentioned. Again, where Demosthenes strives to be jocose or witty, he makes us laugh rather at him than with him; nor is he ever so far from graciousness as when he courts it. For instance, if he had tried to write the elegant defence of Phryne or of Athenogenes he [would have shown the superiority of Hypereides] still more. The beauties of Hypereides, though many, are yet wanting in grandeur; they are of a sober character, without energy, and allow the hearer to remain placid. No reader of Hypereides feels terror. But Demosthenes is of the greatest nature. He has lofty eloquence, intensity, living passion, copiousness, rapidity of thought. Above all, that which is his ownunapproachable mastery and force of oratorical art. These are heaven-sent, astonishing giftshuman they may not be calledand, having these in their fulness, he prevails over all other oratorseven over those who, like Hypereides, have beauties which he lacks.

Andokides is an amateur,  not uninfluenced by what the artists are doing, but with no complete theory of his own. Just such an amateur is Aeschines in comparison with (for instance) Hypereides. On the other hand, the positive superiority of Aeschines to Andokides, as an orator, is immense. Scarcely more than Andokides did Aeschines possess the  , of speaking; but he had, in a far greater measure than Andokides, the  , which, even without art, can do much to serve the need of the hourthis practice including both the habit of composition and skill in declamation. Lastly, he had in an extraordinary degree, the third and supreme requisite, . His natural gift was most brilliant. If we  look to that conception of himself as an orator which Aeschines puts forward when he desires to appear at the greatest advantage over against Demosthenes, we shall find that it has two chief traits. First, Aeschines gives it to be understood that he is the man of spontaneous eloquence, while Demosthenes is the laborious rhetor. Secondly, Aeschines piques himself on his , meaning by this partly his familiarity with the standard poets, such as the old tragedians; partly a general sense of propriety or refinement, which, for instance, leads him to imitate the decorum () of the old orators, like Solon or Perikles, by speaking with his hand within his robe, instead of using vehement\n action;and which helps to guard him, again, from such faults of taste in expression as he imputes to his rival. This second pretension, in both its parts, is originally the tragic actor's; Aeschines is usually at his worst when he puts it forward; and at the end of his career it comes in as his evil genius in the disastrous peroration against Ktesiphon. As for his other pretensionof representing natural as against laboured oratoryAeschines was too shrewd to have made this claim if it had not been roughly like the truth. We may be quite sure that a great many people thought it true. Pytheas, too, could taunt Demosthenes with his speeches smelling of the lamp: a taunt of evil augury for all Greek art. Aeschines had had no systematic  training. One account, indeed, made him the pupil of Isokrates and Plato; others hint that he had imitated Leodamas or studied Alkidamas. But the  best answer is the concise description of his style quoted by his scholiast from Greek critics. It has not finish, purity, or beauty of rhythm: it is blatant (), inartistic, headlong (), easily betrayed into coarse abuse ill-becoming an orator;\n but it has a stamp of power and of facility such as would come of nature , i.e. not under a master.

He had a magnificent voice, under perfect musical control: he compares me to the sirens, says Aeschines of his rival. As tritagonist, he had often to play showy parts, such as Kreon, Kresphontes, Thyestes; and the pose which he adopted when speaking, in contrast with the then customary action, had been studied in the right stage-parts. In his rank of tritagonist, he was probably a good actor. A protagonist, when he had been assigned to the poet by lot, chose his two colleagues; and so eminent a protagonist as Theodoros would not have associated Aeschines with Aristodemos if Aeschines had not been efficient. Demosthenes represents Aeschines as having failed on the boards: the fact seems to be rather that he was ruined by an accident. The  of Sophokles was being played at Kollytos. Aeschines was Oenomaos: in hurrying after Pelops, he stumbled and fell, and was helped to his feet by the leader of the chorus. Modern life has probably no adequate parallel for such a fiasco. If one could conceive the sum of all disasters that can mar a solemnity, or an opera, occurring before five thousand attentive Parisians, it might be easier to comprehend why Aeschines left the Attic stage. After\n having been clerk to some minor official, Aeschines  was secretary to the statesmen Aristophon and Eubulos, and then, with his brother Aphobetos, for two years secretary to the ekklesia.

The first and principal question isHas Dionysios conceived this relation  rightly? Dionysios sets out from the three types distinguished by Theophrastos. The archaic type, with its harsh dignity, is represented by Antiphon and Thucydides; the type of plain elegance, by Lysias; the middle or normal type, by Thrasymachos, Isokrates and Plato. Demosthenes, says Dionysios, joins the excellences of these three types. He uses the middle style ordinarily, and applies the other two where they are fitting: but in each one of the three types he excels its special masters. Demosthenes thus represents the final stage in the development of Attic prose. For Thucydides, language is not as yet a plastic material; for Lysias, it is more plastic, indeed, but not perfectly so, and the treatment is one-sided; for Isokrates it is perfectly plastic, but the treatment is again one-sided. Demosthenes comes to find a middle prose mature, indeed, but limited; he enfranchises it by working in older tendencies native to Attic prose; and the result is the most complete organ of speech into which the elements were capable of being wrought. The same conclusion had been reached by others before Dionysios; but no one had so thoroughly worked out the process. Both the conclusion and\n the method will bear scrutiny, and may be accepted  as sound. The doctrine involves two leading notions that of a normal prose, and that of an eclectic and recombining genius. The first will be illustrated in the next chapter. The second appears to describe correctly what Demosthenes did in the province of expression considered as an art. The moral characteristics of his eloquence, the individual tone of the soul which he breathed into the form thus modelled, belong to another field of inquiry: though, since his art was essentially one with his enthusiasm, it must be attempted presently to suggest what the distinctive stamp of that enthusiasm was."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "8", "head": "Aeschines and Demosthenesthe Speeches on the Crown.", "p": ["The last great picture of political life at Athens is an oratorical contest in which, so far as eloquence is concerned, art, allied with genius, wins the day against clever empiricism.

The unfortunate Lacedaemonians, though they did but touch\n this affair, in its first phase, by their occupation of the temple,they who once claimed the leadership of Greece, are now to be sent to Alexander in Asia to give hostages, to parade their disasters, and to hear their own and their country's doom from his lips, when they have been judged by the clemency of the master whom they have provoked. Our city, the common asylum of the Greeks, to which of old embassies used to come from all Greece to obtain deliverance for their several cities at our handsis now battling, no more for the leadership of Greece, but for the ground on which it stands. And these things have befallen us since Demosthenes took the direction of our policy. The poet Hesiod well interprets such a case.

Every Theban that could be bribed or blinded has been made a tool by Philip: those who withstood him from the first, and who oppose him now, he can  win. What does he mean? Why has he seized Elateia? He means, by displaying his power and planting his camp close at hand, to cheer and embolden his own friends, and to strike terror into his opponents, so that they may either concede from fear what they now refuse, or may be compelled to the concession.

But this wonderful speech, though the greatest, is not the most characteristic work of its author. The speech On the Crown is a retrospect: Demosthenes was a prophet. His genius as an orator takes its  peculiar stamp from the concurrence of two conditions which have seldom been united with an equal completeness, which are not likely, perhaps, to be completely united again, but which, whenever they have so met, have made an epoch of poetry or of oratory. The first is that a free and highly civilised race should be threatened with the overthrow of its civil liberties; the second, that this political\n disaster should have, at the same time, the aspect of a religious defilement. When the national peril is also a menaced pollution, when the cause of altars and of hearths is not only formally or nominally, but in the inmost feelings of the people, one, then the two mightiest inspirations of humanity co-operate, and they who arise to warn, to counsel or to reprove seem both to others and to themselves most like the interpreters of Heaven. The Greeks were, in their own view, something even more than a chosen people; they were, as they conceived, a race primarily and lineally distinct from all the races of men, the very children of the gods, whose holy separation was attested by that deep instinct of their nature which taught them to loathe the alien. No one can ever understand Demosthenes who does not continually keep in mind how Demosthenes regarded Philipnot as the descendant of Herakles, not as a prince of the Argive house who, in a royal exile like that of Teukros, happened to reign over foreign highlanders, but as the personal embodiment of barbarian violence, as the type and the head of those aliens whose foul swarms threatened to break the pure circle of Hellas and to obliterate, or contaminate, everything which Greeks regarded as a sacred distinction of their life. If, as has been complained, his eloquence, instead of flowing, rushes, if his intensity is found monotonous, if he is perceived to be deficient in ease and clearness, let it be remembered that, Greek and artist as he is, things stronger than blood give him his affinity with Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Once only, perhaps, in the history of the world has\n a man of Indo-Germanic race, with something like the same gifts, stood in something like the mental attitude of Demosthenes, and this in the city which of all cities has most resembled his own. Florence, with its active and conscious citizenship, its intelligence and curiosity, its fickleness, its patriotism for Italy, was the Athens, as steady and somewhat rigid Venice was the Sparta, of the Italian republics; and the Athens of Eubulos had more ignoble analogies with the Florence of Lorenzo. When invasion was threatening from the North, when political freedom was in danger, and when it seemed that the Church also must be scourged before it could be regenerated, a prophet arose whose one hope was of a resurrection for the spirit of his people and whose passionate denunciations sought to burst, while there was time, the fatal bonds of a cynical lethargy. O Italy! O Rome! I give you over to the hands of a people who will wipe you out from among the nations! I see them descending like lions. Pestilence comes marching hand in hand with war. The deaths will be so many that the buriers shall go through the streets crying out: Who hath dead, who hath dead? And one will bring his father and another his son. O Rome!

The first was that, until after the time of Aristotle, epideictic oratory, the branch of Isokrates, had a higher dignity in general  estimation than either the forensic or the deliberative. A forensic or a deliberative speech had served its purpose when it had been spoken; it might be published, for students or for statesmen; but it was not\n intrinsically a part of the national literature in the same sense as (for instance) the  Aristotle, who had probably heard Demosthenes, notices him only cursorily. Theophrastos, in tracing the development of Attic prose, stopped at Isokrates. It was only later Greek critics who could see things in a more just perspective. Secondly, Isokrates is  the only considerable Attic writer who was also a popular teacher of composition. He could affirm that all the men formed in his school had the same stamp of style: and, so far as the statement can be tested, it seems to be strictly true. The Isokratic  prose was meant to be read rather than to be spoken. This is the basis of its character, distinguishing it from the earlier rhetorical prose, and fitting it to influence the literary prose of the modern world. To the conservative section of the Gorgian school this seemed, of course, an error. When Alkidamas attacked Isokrates in his essay against the composers of written discourses (),meaning, by that phrase, discourses composed, not to be spoken, but to be read,he was loyal to the genuine tradition of his master. The object of Gorgias was to cultivate the faculty of oral and extemporary eloquence. But Isokrates, moved partly by his own want of voice and nerve, partly by the desire of teaching all Greece and of doing permanent work, resolved that epideictic oratory should have a\n literary form. For these purposes, as he saw, the composition of Gorgias and Thrasymachos, with its short clauses, was not sufficiently copious: that of Thucydides was not too rough. He sought, then, to give speech a fuller flow and a softer tone: and he moderated the use of every ornament which disturbs this flow or violates this tone. The chief  marks of Isokratic prose are,the avoidance of poetical diction; the ampler period; evenness, obtained especially by systematic care against the collision of vowels; and the sparing admission of anything like a declamatory or passionate strain. These essential characteristics, to judge from fragments and from notices, were common to the Isokratic school. Epideictic Rhetoric, in application to its old subjects, was doomed. The first generation of Isokratics already felt that it could not last out their time, and were led, therefore, to widen their range. The application of Epideictic Rhetoric to  History was a gain for Rhetoric, and, on the whole, a decided gain for the popular culture of that day: it was even so far a gain to History that much good work was done by men like Theopompos who, fifty years before, would have left nothing but a collection of panegyrical discourses. On the other hand, the vice of an origin from the Rhetoric of display became disastrously apparent when lesser men than Theopompos began to think that they must be accurate if they could, but brilliant at all costs. This evil tendency, however, did not fully set in until the style itself was declining: and it ought not to mislead us into underrating the value to literature of\n the Isokratic prose. Theopompos was a thoroughly  Isokratic composer, but, as might be expected in the disciple who needed the curb, had more force and passion. Ephoros, emulating the smooth copiousness  of his master, was languid and diffuse. Such a contrast of personal temperaments and faculties is the best possible evidence to the definiteness of that common type which could still be recognised in both. The same type was equally clear in Theodektes, who  seems to have had some dialectical training; and in Kephisodoros, who shared the orthodox hostility of  his school to dialectic. In short, there was now a literary method, not to be obscured by individualities of culture or of aptitude, in virtue of which its possessor could be called Isokratic."}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "6", "head": "Isokratic prose and its influence", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "The Isokratic Type becomes the standard of prose."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Its rivals."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Its influencc how far felt by Plato"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "title": "Att.

Alkidamas might defend, and Lykophron illustrate, the principles of Gorgias. Polykrates and Zoilos might show that something of Lysian elegance could be carried into other fields than the forensic. But, for the general uses of literature, the Isokratic style had been accepted as the standard. This may be seen from the way in which its influence grew upon writers outside the school. Plato's style has no law  but itself; it has its unique place in the border-land between poetry and prose, being, as a rule, at its highest when it is nearer to the former. For our present purpose, it would scarcely be profitable to\n dwell on the  The general marks of its style are manifest; the easy, irregular structure of dialogue interferes with the management of the unwonted oratorical period; the ornament is in the immature manner of Gorgias, not at all in that of Isokrates or Lysias; the diction shows occasional redundance, and even what a modern reader can agree with ancient Greek criticism in regarding as of doubtful correctness; the habit of irony slips into a homeliness which, here, is grotesque; and a few phrases are not far from dithyrambs.

The fact is certain: but those who have tried to see what this oratory in its essence was, will be the first to feel that the connexion between the two things is not altogether self-evident. As to  the Deliberative branch, that, clearly, was doomed to decay when the questions which the ekklesia could discuss with a practical result came to be hardly more than municipal. A good notion of the manner in which the province of debate was now restricted may be got from a speech made eight years after Chaeroneia, when Alexander was in the mid-career of his Asiatic victories. An Athenian citizen of the Macedonian party had tried to damage his adversary in a law-suit by insinuating that this\n adversary had flattered Olympias and Alexander. Hypereides retorts that it would be more to the purpose if, instead of making such charges, Polyeuktos could muster courage to go and denounce the injurious dictation of Macedon before the Panhellenic Congress: but the very way in which this is put implies that it was more than could be expected of ordinary patriotism; and the merit claimed for Euxenippos is not that  has done anything of the kind, but simply that he has shunned association with the active Athenian agents of Alexander. As Aristotle says, no one deliberates about the impossible; and, in regard to independent action, the limits of the possible for Athens had become narrow. Nor was the Forensic branch exempt from  similar influences. Macedonian blandishments could reach jurors as well as debaters: the art of persuasion, pure and simple, would count for less and less; and the aim of the Athenian writer for the lawcourts would become more and more like that of the speaker whose first object is the display of his faculty. Granting all this, however, why, it may be asked,  should not Attic oratory, being essentially a fine art, have found at least one secure refuge in this very department of display; especially since the Epideictic branch had become so closely identified with the national literature? As long as there were such writers as Theopompos, or even Ephoros, a tolerably pure Attic style might surely be preserved, even though there were no longer political inspirations for the deliberative speaker, or, for the advocate, the opportunities of a real equality before the law.

And assuredly a true answer to it is not to be found merely in the political circumstances of the time when Athens had just come under the leadership of Macedon. We must go further back, and look deeper into the conditions under which the best work of Greek art was done. In the Ionian republics, and especially at Athens, while their life was still healthy, letters and the fine arts entered into the education which was received by all citizens alike. Letters and the fine arts were therefore subject to the opinion, not of a class, but of the entire city. The artist, whether sculptor or architect, painter,  poet or orator, received the impress of the national mind, and reflected it from his own. He worked for all the citizens, and he knew that he would be judged, not by a few critics, but by the whole civic body. The Greek genius, in its purest and brightest form, tended of itself to fix its attention on what is essential and typical in nature, and to suppress those mere accidents of which the prominence is always disturbing and at last grotesque. Here was a further safeguard for the artistic worker who began with this inborn tendency. Mannerism and exaggeration may be made the fashion of a clique, but, where public opinion is really free, they will never be popular. The Greek artist who, in rivalry with brother artists, sought for the approbation of his fellow-citizens gathered in the theatre, or going about their daily work amid gracious forms of marble or\n living shapes still more beautiful, in the clear air of Attica and close to the foam and freshness of the sea, knew that no refinements of the study could save him if he was false to nature, and knew, also, that his loyalty to nature would be surely recognised just in proportion as he brought out, not the trivial or transient things, not such things as depend for their interest on an artificial situation, but those lineaments of nature which have the divine simplicity of permanence. It cannot be too often repeated,  it is a thoroughly vulgar misconception, more fatal than anything else to the comprehension of all Greek things, to suppose that the Athenian statesmen or cobblers who went to the theatre of Dionysos in the days of Perikles found the art of Sophocles cold because it was ideal, and would have thought the demonstrative and rhetorical pathos of Euripides more human. Their feeling, happily, was very different, or the Parthenon would have been very different too. They felt that the immortal things of humanity are more human than its accidents; and therefore, the poorest of them, they could rise out of the mean or grievous things of daily life into a contemplation which educated the passions that it moved and resolved the anguish of pity or of terror in a musical and chastened joy. The festive disposition of the Greeks is a perpetual snare to modern writers who cannot dissociate the love of dinner-parties from a tone either mildly cynical or at all events the reverse of transcendental, and who hasten to the conclusion that an inquirer exempt from academical sentiment or pedantry will study\n the real Greeks in their comedians or their cooks. It was not until the moral unity of the State was broken, and men began to live a life of thought or pleasure apart from the life of the city, that the artists began to work for the few, and that the taste of the many sank below the power of appreciating the highest beauty. Philip, Alexander and their Successors were indeed the apostles of Greek language, Greek art, Greek social civilisation: but between Hellas and Hellenism there was a spiritual  separation which no force of the individual mind could do away. Literature and art had been sacred energies and public delights to the citizens of free Athens: to the writers or artists of Antioch or  Alexandria they were agreeable industries, inviting reward or awaiting correction from aristocratic patrons, whose artificial canons encouraged either an elaborate vagueness of expression or the pretence of an occult profundity. The lapse of literature and art into the depths of affectation is only a matter of time when the judges on whom recognition depends are a capricious and absolute oligarchy. There  is no lasting security for truth in artistic creation except an intelligent public, pronouncing with authority and not intimidated by the prescriptions of a coterie or a caste. In this sense, it may justly be said that nothing is so democratic as taste; nor could there be a better illustration than a\n comparison between the Athens of Perikles and the Alexandria of the Ptolemies."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "3", "head": "Meaning of Asianism.", "p": {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ti/ni diafe/rei o( *)attiko)s zh=los tou= *)asianou="}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "kata\\ tw=n *frugw=n"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*kaiki/lios."}], "title": "Orat.", "quote": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Itaque Caria et Phrygia et Mysia, quod minime politae minimeque elegantes sunt, asciverunt opimum quoddam et tanquam adipatae diction is genus."}, "#text": "A lost treatise of Caecilius who also wrote on the question,   was called being a polemical introduction to his Lexicon of Attic phrases: Suidas s. v.

This cause was the same which gradually vitiated every other branch of Greek art, and which prepared the downfall of Greek independence itself the decay of the citizen-life of the Greek republics, whereby Greek art in every kind lost that popular character which was the external safeguard of the Greek artist's instinct for truth. It is important, therefore, to get rid of the notion that, when Asianism is opposed to Atticism, the meaning is that Attic simplicity was overlaid by the tawdry taste of the Orientals among whom Greek letters were diffused by the conquests of Alexander. It is true that, in the new Hellenic settlements of Karia, Mysia and the Hellespont, Greek nationality was less pure, and that when the Augustan Atticists wished to stigmatise their opponents they loved to call them Phrygians. But the depravation began in Athens itself: it became universal, because the\n demoralisation of the Greeks was universal: it passed over to Asia with the literature of the emigration, and there it grew worse: but it grew worse everywhere else too. Kallisthenes of Stageiros, Timaeos of Tauromenion, had the Asiatic tendency as distinctly as any son of Tralles or Alabanda. Asiatic, as applied to Greek oratory, is properly a geographical term only. It expresses the fact that, from about 320 to about 280 B.C., the new Greek settlements in Asia Minor were the parts of Hellas in which oratory and prose literature were most actively cultivated. The general character of this prose was the same as the general character of prose in Sicily, at Athens, and in every other part of Hellas. Asianism versus Atticism means the New versus the Old Oratory. The essential difference between them is this. The Old Oratory was an art, and was  therefore based upon a theory. The New Oratory was a knack, , and was founded upon practice, . Atticism was technical and, in its highest phase, scientific. Asianism was empirical.

Not even the definite Isokratic type,\n or the scientific Rhetoric founded by Aristotle, is proof against them. Aristotle's pupil Demetrios of  Phaleron is named by Cicero as the first who impaired the strength of Attic oratory, preferring his own sweetness to the weight and dignity of his predecessors. His style, like his life, was elegantly luxurious; but in becoming ornate it became nerveless; there is no longer, says Cicero, sucus ille et sanguis incorruptus, the sap, the fresh vigour, which had hitherto been in oratory; in their place there is fucatus nitor, an artificial gloss. In the school of Isokrates, the decline is represented by Kallisthenes of Stageiros, who accompanied  Alexander to the East, and who, in a memoir, described the Pamphylian Sea as lashing its shores for joy at the hero's approach. Timaeos of Tauromenion,  also an imitator of Isokrates, did not err on this side, but had the taste for verbal conceits in a measure which the Middle Comedy would not have tolerated. Kleitarchos, son of the historian Deinon,  was more like Kallisthenes; as the author of the treatise  observes, His pipe is small, but he blows it loud; and the criticism is justified by a specimen of his manner which another writer has preserved. Kleitarchos, describing the habits of a bee, said, ,just, the critic complains, as if he had been speaking of the Erymanthian boar. But the new tendencies are more strongly exemplified by Hegesias of Magnesia,  (about 270 B.C.), who has sometimes been called, in a\n misleading phrase, the founder of Asianism. Hegesias was deliberately opposed to everything that Isokrates had introduced and Demosthenes had perfected. In diction, he was a coarse imitator of Lysias; in composition, he adopted a style of short clauses which was his own. Dionysios pronounces him finnikin (), languid, and blames especially his ignoble rhythmsmeaning thereby especially the trochee and the tribrach as opposed to the paeon and the dactyl. But the chief characteristic of his style must have been the curious combination of jerkiness and magniloquence, of which the following is a specimen:. Within fifty years after the death of Demosthenes, Hegesias could be a favourite. Gorgias of Athens, Cicero's master, took his examples from Hegesias as well as from Demosthenes and Hypereides; Varro () and Strabo () praised him; and it was reserved for Cicero and Dionysios to discover that he was an example of what is to be avoided."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "6", "head": "Period from 250 to 150 B.C. obscure.", "p": [{"pb": {"@n": "443"}, "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Cicero on the two kinds of Asianism."}, "bibl": {"@n": "Cic. ad Brut. 325", "title": "Brut.", "#text": "325"}, "#text": "From 250 to 150 B.C. the history of Greek oratory is as obscure as the names which represent it.

The other kind is not studded with such points; rather it rushes with an impetuous stream, and this is the manner now universal in Asia (50 B. C.).

The art of Rhetoric, which now for a century and a half had exercised little influence on oratory, had passed at Athens through two phases.    First, the Practical Rhetoric founded in Sicily by Korax had been perfected by Anaximenes and Isokrates.  This could not exist without a practical object;  it perished before Athens had become what Athens was in the days of Polybios.  'The sea is there and the headlands and the everlasting hills;  Athn still stands spear in hand, as the guardian of her chosen city;  Dmos still sits in Pnyx;  he still choose Archons by the lot and Generals by the uplifted hand;  but the fierce democracy has sunk into the lifelessness of a cheerless and dishounored old age;  its decrees consist of fulsome adulation of foreign kings;  its demagogues and orators are sunk into beggars who wander from court to court to gather a few talents of alms for the People which once received tribute from a thousand cities.'  But, just as the Practical Rhetoric was about to perish because its occupation was gone, Aristotle claimed Rhetoric for philosophy.    The Philosophical Rhetoric necessarily aimed, of course, at forming practical orators;  but, unlike its predecessor, it had a reason for existing independently of results.  In the schools of the philosophers accordingly, and chiefly in the Peripatetic school, it had lived on.  Hermagoras now worked up the treatises both of the Practical and of the Philosophical\n Rhetoric into a new system. His object was practical; but he followed the philosophers in giving his chief care to the province of Invention. Erring on the side of too much subtlety, he founded a Rhetoric which, as distinguished from the Practical and the Philosophical, may be called the Scholastic. For Greek oratory this could do little directly. But  for Roman oratory Hermagoras and his followers did  very much what the school of Isokrates had done for Athens. And both to Greece and to Rome they did good service by reviving the conception of oratory not as a knack but as an art, and so preparing men once more to discern between the true artists and the false. It is not a mere coincidence, it is one  illustration more of the close bond between oratory and the other arts that, just about the time when the Atticist revival was beginning, there are traces of a renascence in Greek sculpture. From about 300  to 150 B.C. the school of Lysippos had prevaileda school which substituted the real for the ideal, selecting the basest subjects if in these a frigid technical skill could be shown forth. In sculpture, as in oratory, ingenuity or pretension had marred simplicity, dignity and beauty; and the generation that began to revolt from Hegesias began also to revolt from Lysippos."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "So-called Rhodian School:  a mere compromise in favour of Atticism."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Rhodes under the Diadochi."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Fame for oratory from circ. 100 B C."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Estimate of the Rhodian merits."}], "pb": {"@n": "446"}, "#text": "It may have been Cicero who paid a compliment  to his teacher Molon by setting the fashion of distinguishing a Rhodian School from the Attic and the Asiatic.

Next to Calvus probably came Messalla Corvinus, who  translated the defence of Phryne by Hypereides, and who is said to have been not unsuccessful in reproducing something of the master's eloquence.

One sect of the earlier Roman Atticists worshipped  Xenophon; another, Thucydides; another, Lysias and Hypereides.

Rome was only developing her artistic literature: Greece had seen hers pass through maturity to decay. The sapling might be trained to lines of growth in which it should bear fruit hereafter; the withered tree could blossom no more. The Atticist Revival gave Rome true canons for living work. It gave Greece, not this, but the only thing now possible, a standard for the appreciation of the past. The representative of the revival, as it affected Rome, is Cicero. The representative of the revival, as it affected both Rome  and Greece, is Dionysios of Halikarnassos, the greatest critic of the ancient world who was not a philosopher. Philosophical criticism began with Aristotle; and, for antiquity, may be said to have ended with him. But the literary criticism of the  ancient world was never so thorough as in Dionysios. He and his friend Caecilius, those two men who,  in the reign of Augustus, gave a complete expression to all the tendencies and energies of the reaction which had been growing for nearly a century, had this for a common characteristic,they were determined not to lose themselves in the subtleties of the new Scholastic Rhetoric: they saw that there was better work to be done. They  did not try to strike out a new path through these technical mazes, like Apollodoros of Pergamos or his antagonist Theodoros of Gadara just before them, or like Hermogenes after them. On technical points, Dionysios generally goes back to Aristotle or Theophrastos. He and his friend saw that the revival of theory had performed its part, by recalling\n attention to those works of true art by which the theory was illustrated. What was now needed was not a  more minute analysis but a better aesthetic criticism. For Cicero's teacher at Athens, Demosthenes and Hegesias were alike classical. This must not be. Men must be taught to feel, and not merely to recognise by a mechanical test, that Hegesias and Demosthenes are of different orders. This desire of clearer insight into the things which make the Attic excellences was necessarily connected with the task of separating genuine from spurious works. In the  catalogues of the orators () at Pergamos or Alexandria the librarian had merely to register the traditional authorship. He could not enter upon critical inquiries. Such inquiries were undertaken by Dionysios and Caecilius. The paper of Dionysios on Deinarchos exemplifies his method. The evidence used is external as well as internal: the rhetor's life is sketched; his models are indicated; the tradition is tried by its warranty, by that conception of the writer's style which the critic has formed for himself, and by the subject-matter. Dionysios was, however, preeminently the literary  critic, Caecilius was preeminently the scholar and grammarian. The treatment of the Attic orators by the two men respectively suggests the greater independence and greater subtlety of Dionysios in this field. On the other hand, Caecilius was the first to  cultivate a province on which Dionysios does not seem to have entered.

Cicero, the Roman, conceives Atticism as an unbroken tradition, which was merely adulterated and debased by those influences which are called Asiatic. In one sense this is most true. Athens made once for all the conquest of Hellenic prose. The forms of the Attic dialect became once for all the standard forms of Greek literature, and are so in the newspapers of today. From Polybios to Trikoupes the literary supremacy of Athens has been acknowledged by men who have written in a dialect which they did not speak. It has been truly said that the latest Byzantine was, in language, nearer to Xenophon than Xenophon was to Herodotos. On the other hand, just as a Roman could scarcely comprehend the feeling with which Demosthenes regarded Philip, so a Roman could scarcely comprehend the feeling with which Dionysios and Caecilius regarded Hegesias. To those Greek scholars living in Augustan Rome, Asianism, when they looked back on it and compared it with the art of better days, seemed not merely a debasement, but an extinction, of the soul by which that art had lived. Attic forms might be retained; but without the Attic spirit they were dead. The continuity had been merely outward. Let us hear  Dionysios say this in his own vivid words. Great thanks might justly be given to our days, most\n excellent Ammaeus, as well for an improvement in other branches of culture, as particularly for the signal advance that has been made by the study of Civil Oratory. For, in the times before ours, the old scientific Rhetoric was threatened with abolition by the contumelies and outrages that it suffered. From the death of Alexander of Macedon it began to yield up its spirit and gradually to fade; and in our own generation it was all but totally extinguished. A stranger crept into the other's placeimmodest, theatrical, ill-bred, intolerable, imbued neither with philosophy nor with any other liberal discipline; stealthily she imposed on the ignorance of the multitude; and, besides living in greater wealth, luxury, splendour than her predecessor, drew into her own hands all those threads of political power and influence which should have been held by her wiser sister. Utterly vulgar and meddlesome, the usurper at last made Greece like to the households of misguided profligates. For, even as in such houses the true wife, freeborn and virtuous, sits powerless over all that is her own, while a giddy paramour, a presence fatal to the home, claims to govern its fortunes, heaping scorns and threats on their rightful queen; even so in every cityaye, and worst of all, in the seats of culture no less than elsewherethe Attic Muse, daughter of the land and of its memories, had been disinherited and made a mockery, while the abuse that had come but yesterday from some barbarians of Asia, an outlandish baggage from Phrygia or Karia, presumed to rule the cities of Greece, when, by her, the other had been driven\n from their councilsthe wise damsel by the foolish, the modest by the mad."}}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "12", "head": "Permanent results of the revival.", "p": {"pb": {"@n": "455"}, "#text": "Atticism could not quicken the dead things of Greece, nor could it permanently guard Rome against the intrusions of a false taste. Two things, however, it did, and for these it deserves the gratitude of mankind. It set correct models before those great Roman writers who, in their turn, have been examples to the modern world. It founded a Greek criticism of Greek literature in which the perspective was just, and recorded the reasons of men, whose qualifications and opportunities were complete, for comparative estimates which the sense of posterity has approved, but to which posterity alone could not have given so authoritative a sanction. Greek lived on, to be the tongue in which Marcus and Julian, by the Danube or the Rhine, asserted the late supremacy of a wisdom that carried the seeds of death, to bring the message of a hope beyond the grave and to bear on a strenuous tide the voices of men whom that promise made sublime, to be the record of empire in the city of Constantine, to write its legends on the stones of Ravenna or to blazon them on the apses of Venice and Torcello, even to keep bright the memories of civil freedom where, in a northern isolation, in the Tauric land washed by the harbourless sea, the fire once taken from Megara burned for centuries on the last altar of the hearth that had a Greek commonwealth for its shrine, and at last, in our own age, after a second deliverance from the barbarian, most happily to be\n come once more the language of a free Greek people; but never under any sky to recover that balance of its native qualities which had been so perfect and so transient. Yet the writers and speakers who had moulded Attic speech were to have an influence which should be world-wide and perpetual even when it was unfelt. After that long night for Greek art which began with the death of Alexander, when the cold dawn of a new day was breaking on the earth silent under the dominion of Augustus, men of Greek race rekindled an instinct for the best things that Greece had done in the half-forgotten morning of her gladness, her glorious strength, her beauty made musical by intelligent and gracious self-mastery. As the little band of Xenophon's comrades, hemmed in by barbarians and fighting their way back to Hellas out of the heart of Asia, burst into a cry of joy as they saw from the hill-top the first light of the waves of the Euxine, so these loyal workers were rejoiced afar off by a gleam from the sunlit surface of that clear sea which ripples at the feet of a pure and an immortal Aphrodite. They strove on, and won their way to their goal: for they brought the Athenian spirit once more into the central current of human life by communicating it to the genius of Rome."}}]}]}}}}
