The Tetralogies hold a corresponding place between merely ornamental exercises and real orations. Each of them forms a set of four speeches, supposed to be spoken in a trial for homicide. The accuser states his charge, and the defendant replies; the accuser then speaks again, and the defendant follows with a second reply. The imaginary case is in each instance sketched as lightly as possible; details are dispensed with; only the essential frame-work for discussion is supplied. Hence, in these skeleton-speeches, the structure and anatomy of the argument stand forth in naked clearness, stripped of everything accidental, and showing in bold relief the organic lines of a rhetorical pleader's thought.    f.

The boy's father accuses the youth  whose father defends him  of accidental homicide; and the case comes before the court of the Palladion. In order to understand the issues raised, it is necessary to keep in mind the Greek view of accidental homicide. This view was mainly a religious one. The death was a pollution. Some person, or thing, must be answerable for that pollution, and must be banished from the State, which would else remain defiled. In a case like the supposed one, three hypotheses were possible:  that the cause of the impurity had been the thrower, the person struck, or the missile. There was a special court  that held at the Prutaneion  for the trial of inanimate things which had caused death. Here, however, the question is only of living agents. The judges have nothing whatever to do with the question as to how far either was morally to blame.

Athens, Boeotia, Corinth and Argos were at this time allied against Sparta. The success of Agesilaus in 391 had led the Athenians, probably in the winter of 391  90 B.C., to send plenipotentiaries, among whom was Andocides, to treat for peace at Sparta. According to the terms proposed by the Lacedaemonians, Athens was to retain her Long Walls   rebuilt three years before by Conon  and her fleet; she was also to recover Lemnos, Imbros and Scyros: and Boeotia was to be gratified by the withdrawal of the Spartan garrison from Orchomenus.

Mantitheus must, then, have been at least eighteen years of age in 405 B.C., and so must have been born before 422. He refers to his share in campaigns subsequent to that of 394 B.C. ( 15   18). On the other hand, the tone of  15 rather suggests that Thrasybulus was still alive;  that is, that the speech is earlier than 389 B.C. The date may have been about 392 B.C. The speaker, who was taunted with youthful presumption ( 20), cannot have been much more than thirty.  ."}, "div3": [{"@type": "section", "@n": "1", "p": {"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "tw=n au)toi=s beb"}, "title": "De Cor.", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)ce/tason toi/nun par'  a)/llhla ta\\ soi\\ ka)moi\\ bebiwme/na"}, "#text": "their course of life.

[Or. XII.]  Polemarchus,  brother of Lysias, had been put to death by the Thirty Tyrants. Eratosthenes, one of their number, was the man who had arrested him and taken him to prison. In this speech Lysias, himself the speaker, charges Eratosthenes with the murder of Polemarchus, and, generally, with his share in the Tyranny. A special clause in the Amnesty of 403 B.C. excluded the Thirty Tyrants, the Ten who had succeeded them, and the Eleven who had executed their sentences. But any one even of these might enjoy the Amnesty if he chose to stand a public inquiry, and was acquitted. When the oligarchy was finally overthrown, Pheidon and Eratosthenes were the only members of it who stayed at Athens. As they dared to do this, they must have availed themselves of the permission to give account of their office. Here, then, we have not to do with an ordinary indictment for murder (). The public inquiry into the conduct of Eratosthenes afforded Lysias the opportunity for preferring his accusation.

The oligarchs, impatient to get rid of their opponents, had recourse to the aid of Agoratus. It was arranged that he should himself be charged with plotting to defeat the peace, and should then denounce a certain number of other persons as his accomplices. One Theocritus accused him before the Senate. A party of Senators went to the Peiraeus to arrest him. Agoratus, feigning alarm, took sanctuary at the altar in the temple of Artemis at Munychia. Certain citizens who suspected him to be the victim, or the agent, of a plot, gave bail for him, and offered to take him out of Attica to await quieter times. He declined this proposal, and appeared before the Senate to give information. He denounced, first, the men who had bailed him; then several of the Generals and taxiarchs ( 13), among whom were the General Strombichides, Dionysodorus (kinsman of the accuser in this case), and probably Eucrates the brother of Nicias; also a number of other citizens.

The work of Isocrates was to establish a standard type of literary rhetorical prose. His discourses were meant to be read rather than to be spoken. This is one essential characteristic which distinguishes them from the compositions of the other Attic orators. Isocrates is properly an orator only in his forensic speeches, the earliest, and in his own view the least significant, of his writings. In his later life he altogether repudiated Forensic Rhetoric; on the other hand, want of voice and nerve, as he tells us, deterred him from taking part in the debates of the Ecclesia. The real work of his life was twofold. First, he was an educator, the head of a school which became renowned  teaching young men the art which he calls , the discipline of discourse  meaning by this, the art of speaking and writing on large political subjects, considered as a preparation for advising or acting in political affairs. (Cp. , II. ch. XIII. on his , or theory of culture.) Secondly, he was a political essayist. In this quality  his writings being widely read throughout Greece  he had perhaps a greater influence on popular opinion than belonged to any literary man of his time. The style of literary prose which he developed had found general acceptance before 350 B.C.; through Greek teachers who gave it a more florid colour, it did much to mould the style of Cicero, who speaks of himself as using all the fragrant essences of Isocrates, and all the little stores of his disciples ( II. 1); and through Cicero, or directly, it has exerted an influence on modern literature. It has been truly remarked that, for the modern world, the oratory of the preacher is the best image of that grave eloquence in which Isocrates excelled.

Instead of aiming at the vigorous compression fittest for real contests, it has a certain rich diffuseness. Dionysius speaks of the , the meandering periods of Isocr.  having in his mind such an image as that of a river which leads us on from bend to bend through the  soft beauties of its winding course. Isocrates was the first great artist in a Greek prose which, without being bound by the constraints of  (), has yet a free  of its own (,   16, p. 115). The peculiar  of Isocr. results esp. from his careful observance of his own rule, , i.e. a vowel at the end of a word must not be followed by a vowel at the beginning of the next. Plutarch speaks of Isocr. as  ( c. 8). Demosthenes did not press this rule so far (). The figures () specially used by Isocr. are those which depend on parallelism: viz. (1)   a parallelism in sense: (2) , a parallelism in form between two clauses or sentences: (3) , a parallelism of sound, when the latter of two clauses gives an echo of the former, either at its opening or at its close, or throughout. The same antithetical bent appears in Isocr.'s treatment of subject-matter, where his habit is to work out a leading idea by developing all the contrasts which it suggests. Thus the subject of the  is a Greek war with Persia. Greece is dealt with in the first part, Persia in the second: in part I., again, Athens is contrasted with Sparta: the services of Athens to Greece are divided into the civil and the military,   the latter being classed as in wars between Greeks or in wars between Greek and barbarian: part II. shows that Persia is open to attack, while Greece has every motive for attacking."}, {"title": ["Hist.

This has been well brought out by Curtius ( v. 116, 204). Athens, says Isocr., has so distanced the rest of the world in power of thought and speech that her disciples have become the teachers of all other men. She has brought it to pass that the name of Greek should be thought no longer a matter of race but a matter of intelligence; and should be given to the participators in our culture rather than to the sharers of our common origin:   50.

The Thebans prescribed, as one condition of peace, the recognition of the independence of Messene, the new state founded by Epameinondas in 370. A congress met at Sparta. The Spartans refused to recognise the independence of Messene; and accordingly remained, with Athens, at war against Thebes.

Deprived of these, it was merely a criminal court of narrow competence. Its connection with what was most venerable in the old religion, and the high standing of its individual members, still secured to it, indeed, a large measure of respect. Isocrates speaks of the good influence which, even in his own day, wrought on those who became members of the college. But politically the Areiopagus was now powerless.

This statement is decisively rejected by Dionysius, who concludes, on the authority of Cephisodorus, the orator's pupil, that Isocrates wrote a certain number of such speeches, though not nearly so many as Aristotle had reported. The modern hypothesis that Isocrates composed the extant forensic orations merely as exercises (), not for real causes, is another attempt to explain his later tone. But these later utterances merely mean that Isocrates regarded his former work for the law-courts as an unworthy accident of  his early life, previous to the beginning of his true career.

The speaker's object is to show that the will is not only genuine, but also just and reasonable, since his own conduct towards the testator Thrasylochus had established a strong claim. In the first place he had saved the very property now in question. Thrasylochus and his brother Sopolis, citizens of Siphnos, had, for security, placed the greater part of their fortune in the neighbouring island of Paros. Paros was suddenly seized by a party of democratic exiles, Parians and Siphnians, led by one Pasnus. At the risk of his life, the speaker sailed by night to Paros, and carried the endangered property back to Siphnos. Presently the democratic masters of Paros attacked and took Siphnos itself. The speaker   whose family belonged to the aristocracy of the island, and had even given it kings  was among those who were forced to fly. He took with him, not only his own mother and sister, but Thrasylochus, who was then in weak health. The speaker and his family wished to remain at Melos. But Thrasylochus entreated them to accompany him to Troezen; and, though they knew the place to be unhealthy, they consented. The speaker's sister and mother died soon after their arrival. He afterwards nursed Thrasylochus through a long and distressing illness in Aegina. During that illness the half sister of Thrasylochus, who now claims his property, never once visited him; nor, on his death, did she attend his funeral ( 16  33)."], "div3": [{"@type": "section", "@n": "18", "head": "18  27.", "p": [{"lemma": {"@lang": "greek", "@targOrder": "U", "#text": "kai\\ peri\\ me\\n tw=n palaiw=n...e)/xein"}, "pb": {"@n": "353"}, "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "tw=n palaiw=n"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*pa/ron"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "u(pekkei/mena"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "u(pekti/qhmi"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "diekomi/zonto eu)qu\\s o(/qen u(pece/qento"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "pai=das kai\\ gunai=kas kai\\ th\\n periou=san kataskeuh/n"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "o(/sa u(pece/keito au)to/qi tw=n *klazomeni/wn.  a)sfalw=s e)/xein"}], "bibl": [{"@n": "Thuc. 1.89", "#text": "Thuc.

He repeated three verses of Euripides  verses commemorating three aliens who had been conquerors of Greeks,  Danaus, Pelops, Cadmus  and four days afterwards, on the burial-day of those who fell at Chaeroneia, he died of voluntary starvation. Undoubtedly Isocrates regretted the struggle between Athens and Philip: but the result of the struggle was that the idea of his life  a Panhellenic war against the barbarian  had been made possible. The conduct of Philip to Athens after Chaeroneia was studiously temperate and conciliatory; there was nothing in it to estrange Isocrates from his ideal leader, who, having struck one necessary blow, was now bent on healing the discords of Greece. It would be more easy to conceive that Isocrates should have destroyed himself because he saw Athens still resolved to resist, and could not support the anguish of a divided loyalty. But, to my mind, the Letter itself leaves little room for doubting that it was written after the conclusion of the peace between Philip and Athens, and was taken to Philip by Antipater on his return: see  1, 2.

In composition (), on the other hand, there is marked difference. Lysias broke through the rigid monotony of the earlier periodic style, replacing it by one which was more flexible and various: yet, though his composition as a whole has ease and variety, his love of antithesis frequently gives too much stiffness and uniformity to the structure of his periods themselves. Isaeus is exempt from this excessive love of antithesis: but, on the whole, his composition is distinguished from that of Lysias mainly by the stamp of conscious art. In reading him we have a continual sense of trained and confident skill. The more open and vigorous character of this art, as compared with that  of Lysias, is illustrated by the freedom with which Isaeus employs the animated figures of thought (), especially the rhetorical question (e.g. or. VIII.  28, p. 194). This does not deprive Isaeus of ethical persuasiveness. Reasoned remonstrance, vigorous contention, just indignation, are powerfully expressed: it is only in the delineation of the ingenuous youth or the plain citizen that he yields to the veiled subtlety of Lysias.

The Roman will of Cicero's time was already a true testament. The Athenian  belongs to an intermediate stage.
