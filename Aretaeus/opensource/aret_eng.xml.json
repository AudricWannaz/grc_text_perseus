In these cases, the ailment is fixed in the head, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom it the disorder springs; but, in others, it arises also from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe nerves remote from the head, which sympathise with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprimary organ. Wherefore the great fingers of the hands, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat toes of the feet are contracted; pain, torpor, and trembling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsucceed, and a rush of them to the head takes place.

There are three forms of the convulsion, namely,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a straight line, backwards, and forwards. Tetanus is in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirect line, when the person labouring under the distention is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstretched out straight and inflexible.

Severe cold also sometimes proves a cause; for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis reason, winter of all the seasons most especially engenders\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese affections; next to it, spring and autumn, but least of all\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsummer, unless when preceded by a wound, or when any strange\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiseases prevail epidemically. Women are more disposed to tetanus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan men, because they are of a cold temperament; but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey more readily recover, because they are of a humid. With\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trespect to the different ages, children are frequently affected,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut do not often die, because the affection is familiar and akin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto them; striplings are less liable to suffer, but more readily\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdie; adults least of all, whereas old men are most subject\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the disease, and most apt to die; the cause of this is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe frigidity and dryness of old age, and the nature of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath. But if the cold be along with humidity, these\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspasmodic diseases are more innocent, and attended with less\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdanger.", "In all these varieties, then, to speak generally, there is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpain and tension of the tendons and spine, and of the muscles\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconnected with the jaws and cheek; for they fasten the lower\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjaw to the upper, so that it could not easily be separated even\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith levers or a wedge. But if one, by forcibly separating\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe teeth, pour in some liquid, the patients do not drink it but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsquirt it out, or retain it in the mouth, or it regurgitates by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe nostrils; for the isthmus faucium is strongly compressed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the tonsils being hard and tense, do not coalesce so as to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpropel that which is swallowed.

This we call Synanche, as if from the disease inclining\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinwardly and producing suffocation. It appears to me that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis is an illness of the spirit () itself, which has under-gone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta morbid conversion to a hotter and drier state, without\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tany inflammation of the organ itself.

And diseases resemble deleterious substances, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmen have similar vomitings from medicines and from fevers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHence, also, it was not a wonderful thing, that in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplague of Athens, certain persons fancied that poisonous\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubstances had been thrown into the wells in the Pir\u00e6us\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby the Peloponnesians; for these persons did not perceive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe affinity between a pestilential disease and deleterious\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubstances."}, "Cases of Cynanche are attended with inflammation of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttonsils, of the fauces, and of the whole mouth; the tongue\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprotrudes beyond the teeth and lips; they have salivation, the", "phlegm running out very thick and cold; they have their faces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\truddy and swollen; their eyes protuberant, wide open, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tred; the drink regurgitates by the nostrils. The pains\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tviolent, but obscured by the urgency of the suffocation; the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchest and heart are in a state of inflammation; there is a longing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor cold air, yet they inspire but little, until they are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffocated from the obstruction of the passage to the chest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn certain cases, there is a ready transference of the disease to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe chest, and these die from the metastasis; the fevers feeble,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslight, bringing no relief. But if, in any case, there is a turn\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the better, abscesses form on either side, near the ears externally,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor internally about the tonsils; and if these occur\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith torpor, and are not very protracted, the patients recover,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindeed, but with pain and danger.

But the peculiarities\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof each are great, many, and of vital importance, by which it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis easy to distinguish either of them from the other. If,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, it came from the head, with a large discharge of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblood, greater and more numerous symptoms will arise, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tscanty from a slight and small spitting; in these cases, there is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\theaviness of the head, pain, noises of the ears, redness of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcountenance, distension of the veins, vertigo; and these are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpreceded by some obvious cause, such as a blow, exposure to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcold, or heat, or intoxication; for drinking of wine speedily fills\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe head, and speedily empties it, by the bursting of a vessel;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut from a slight intoxication there may be spitting, proceeding\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom rarefaction. Occasionally an habitual hemorrhage from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnostrils is stopped, and being diverted to the palate, produces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe semblance of a bringing up of blood. If, therefore, it be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the head, there is titillation of the palate, frequent hawking,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand with it a copious spitting takes place; a desire supervenes,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand they readily cough.

It runs, also, from the head\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the stomach, when it is vomited up with nausea, and thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproves a source of deception, as appearing to come from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstomach. The blood brought up by spitting is not very thick,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut dark in colour, smooth, consistent, unmixed with other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubstances; for, being hawked up, it comes immediately upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tongue in a round shape, being readily separated; and if\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyou examine the roof of the palate, you will find it thickened\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand ulcerated, and, for the most part, bloody; and a slight\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand simple plan of treatment will suffice, namely, astringents\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapplied to the palate in a cold state; for by hot, relaxing, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdilating applications the flow is increased, and this is an indication\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the spitting is from the head, in which case evacuations\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare to be made from the head by the veins, the nostrils,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor by any other channel of discharge. And these things must\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe done speedily; for if the blood is discharged a considerable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, the flow will become permanent, and the parts there will\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontract the habit of receiving the blood.

Their functions, however, are but half performed; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom this I conclude, that these parts are half affected, as being\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcut in twain by the disease.

For Nature is of equal power in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat which is equally paired; but it is impossible that the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthing should happen where there is an inequality. If, therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe commencement of the affection be below the head, such as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe membrane of the spinal marrow, the parts which are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thomonymous and connected with it are paralysed: the right on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe right side, and the left on the left side. But if the head\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe primarily affected on the right side, the left side of the body\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twill be paralysed; and the right, if on the left side.

But if the urine be retained in large\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquantity, and with distension, the desire of making water\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresembles the pains of labour; they are troubled with flatulence,"}, "which cannot find vent; the fevers are pungent, and of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta dry nature.

The commencement of ischiatic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisease is from the thigh behind, the ham, or the leg. Sometimes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pain appears in the cotyloid cavity, and again extends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the nates or loins, and has the appearance of anything\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trather than an affection of the hip-joint.

For the most part, it passes from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe feet to the hands. For to the disease there is no great\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterval between the hands and the feet, both being of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsimilar nature, slender, devoid of flesh, and very near the external\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcold, but very far from the internal heat; next the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\telbow and the knee, and after these the hip-joint; which is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttransition to the muscles of the back and chest. It is incredible\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thow far the mischief spreads. The vertebr\u00e6 of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspine and neck are affected with the pain, and it extends to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe extremity of the os sacrum: there is a general pain of all\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe parts of the groin, and a pain peculiar to each part thereof.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut likewise the tendons and muscles are intensely pained; the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmuscles of the jaws and temples; the kidneys, and the bladder\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnext in succession. And, what a wonder! at last the nose,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ears, and the lips, suffer; for every where there are nerves\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand muscles. A certain person had pains in the sutures of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe head, and not knowing why he was pained there, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpointed out the shapes of the sutures--the oblique, the straight,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe transverse--both behind and before, and stated that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpain was narrow and fixed in the bones; for the disease spreads\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tover every commissure of the bones, in the same manner as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the joints of a foot or of a hand. Callosities also form in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe joints; at first they resemble abscesses, but afterwards they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tget more condensed, and the humour being condensed is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to dissolve; at last they are converted into hard,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhite tophi, and over the whole there are small tumours, like\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvari and larger; but the humour is thick, white, and like hailstones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor it is a cold disease of the whole (body), like hail;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand there appears to be a difference in regard to heat and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcold; for in certain cases there is delight in things otherwise\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisagreeable. But, I fancy, that the cause is a refrigeration", "of the innate heat, and that the disease is single; but if it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspeedily give way, and the heat re-appears, there is need of refrigeration\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand it delights in such things; this is called the hot\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspecies. But if the pain remain internally in the nerves, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe part not becoming heated subside, nor get swollen, I\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould call this variety cold, for which there is need of hot\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmedicines to restore the heat, of which those very acrid are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmost necessary. For heat excites the collapsed parts to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tswelling, and calls forth the internal heat, when there is need\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof refrigerants. In proof of this, the same things are not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talways expedient in the same cases, for what is beneficial at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone time proves prejudicial in another; in a word, heat is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trequired in the beginning, and cold at the conclusion. Wherefore\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGout does not often become unremitting; but sometimes it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintermits a long time, for it is slight; hence a person subject\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto Gout has won the race in the Olympiac games during the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterval of the disease.", "Men then are more readily affected, but more slightly the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twomen; women more rarely than men, but more severely.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor what is not usual nor cognate, if from necessity it gets\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe better engenders a more violent ailment.

The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twild beast, the elephant, indeed, is very different from all\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tothers; in the first place then, he is the greatest and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthickest of animals; in size, he is as great as if you were to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tput one animal on another, like a tower; in bulk, he is as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge as if you should place several other very large animals\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tside by side.

It has been formerly stated by me, how the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmagnitude of the disease is to be estimated. If the patient be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyoung, and the attack of apoplexy weak, it is still no easy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmatter to effect a cure; it must, however, be attempted. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tequivalent remedy, then, as being the great assistance in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta great disease, is venesection, provided there be no mistake\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas to quantity; but the amount is difficult to determine, since\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif you take a little too much, you despatch the patient at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonce; for to them a little blood is most potent, as being that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich imparts the vital heat to the frame itself, and to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfood. But, if the quantity be inferior to the cause, you do\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle good with this the great remedy, for the cause still\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremains. But it is better to err on the side of smallness; for,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif it should seem to have been deficient, and the appearance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the eyes, as seen from below, be favourable, we can open a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvein again. We must open the vein at the hollow of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\telbow, for the blood flows readily from it in the left arm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut in smaller attacks of apoplexy, it is necessary to consider\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhether the paralytic seizure be on the left side or the right.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a word, the abstraction is to be made from the healthy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparts, for there the blood flows more freely, and thither the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trevulsion is made from the parts affected. When, therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe patient is seized with apoplexy without any obvious cause,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twe should decide thus concerning the abstraction of the blood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut if the attack happen from a blow, a fall from a high place,", "or compression, there must be no procrastination, for in certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcases this alone is sufficient for the cure and to save life.", {"hi": {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "leaves"}, "#text": "But if it is not thought expedient to open a vein, owing to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe patient's having been seized with much coldness, torpor,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand insensibility, an injection must be given for the evacuation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the engorgement in the bowels (for very generally persons\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare seized with apoplexy from the immoderate use of food and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twine), and for the revulsion of the humours seated in the head.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe clyster should be acrid; and an evacuant of phlegm and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbile, consisting not only of natron, but also of euphorbium, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe amount of three oboli, added to the usual amount of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclyster, also the medullary part of the wild cucumber,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor the decoction of the hair () of centaury in oil or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twater.

And we are to open the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thollow vein at the elbow (for the blood flows readily from it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand it is easily opened, and the orifice can be safely kept open"}, {"hi": {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "deliquium animi."}, "#text": "for several days). In a word, then, in all the diseases of all\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe vital organs, this is the outlet of the blood. For the one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thigher up and this are both branches of the humeral, so that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe one above can have no more remedial power than the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmesal. They are ignorant of these divisions who have connected\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe upper vein with the stomach and liver. But if the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflow proceed from the spleen, they direct us to open the vein\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the left hand, which runs between the little finger and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone next the middle; for certain physicians held it to terminate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the spleen; but it is a branch of the vein below those at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe elbow. Why, then, should we rather open the vein at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfingers than the one at the elbow? for there it is larger, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe blood flows readily from it. Altogether, then, we are to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstop before coming to  Yet neither, also, is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch blood to be abstracted; for the hemorrhage itself is calculated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto enfeeble the patient; but, after abstracting a small\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquantity, repeat the bleeding the same day, the next, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tday following. But if the patient be thin, and scantily supplied\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith blood, we must not open a vein. So much respecting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe abstraction of blood."}, "We are also to assist by means of ligatures to the extremities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbove the feet to the ankles and knees, and above the hands\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the wrists and arms, a broad band is to be used, so that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconstriction may be strong, and yet not produce pain. To the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tregions, also, from which the blood flows, we are to apply unwashed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twool from the sheep; but moisten it with a liquid,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch as austere wine, and the oils of roses and of myrtles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut if the hemorrhage be of an urgent nature, instead of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twool we are to use sponges, and vinegar instead of the wine,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand let the part be anointed with myrtle oil; and we are to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdust upon the sponges some of the dry inspissated juices, such\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas that of acacia, or of hypocistis, or else of aloes. The juice\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the unripe grape, dissolved in vinegar, is also a very excellent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthing. But if the liquid application be troublesome or", "disagreeable, we are to use plasters; for these stretch the skin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround, and press it, as it were, with the hand, and they are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpossessed of very strong powers as astringents and desiccants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn addition to these, there are very many others of tried\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tefficacy; but the best are those which contain vinegar, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texpressed juice of ivy leaves, and asphaltos, and verdigris,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talum, frankincense, myrrh, calcined copper, the squama \u00e6ris,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand such of the plasters as resemble these; or unscoured wool,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor sponges damped in a small quantity of vinegar. But if the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpatients cannot bear the distension of the plasters, we are to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmake these things into an epitheme: fat dates, damped in dark\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taustere wine, are pounded into a cake; then we are to sprinkle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton it acacia in a soft state, and the rinds of pomegranate;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese things having been all rubbed upon a rag, are applied to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe chest. Barley-meal, moistened in wine or vinegar, or the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfine flour of the dried lentil, sifted in a sieve, and made up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith cerate or rose ointment, is to be applied; we are also to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmix some of the root of the comfrey sifted. Another: Boil\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe roots of the wild prunes in vinegar, and having pounded\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinto a cake, mix a little of sumach, and of gum, and of myrtle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese are to be mixed with one another differently, according\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas the strength of the medicines, mildness, or smell thereof is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twanted. For we must also gratify the sick. These are the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texternal remedies.", "But a more important part of the treatment lies in things\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrunk and swallowed, since these remedies come nearest the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinjured parts. Of these there are three distinct kinds: either\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey are calculated by the contraction or compression of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvessels to bind the passages of the flux; or to incrassate and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcoagulate the fluid, so that it may not flow, even if the passages\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere in a state to convey it; or to dry up the outlets, by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretaining the blood in its pristine state, so that the parts may\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot thus remain emptied by the flux, but may regurgitate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhere the effusion is. For rarefaction of the veins, astringency", "is sufficient, for it runs through the pores like a fluid when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpoured into a water-cask newly wetted. And also in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdivision of vessels stypticity is the remedy, by producing contraction\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the lips; but for this purpose we must use the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgreater and more powerful medicines. But if the form of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\themorrhage be that from erosion, and if the lips of the ulcer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdo not coalesce by the action of the astringents, but the wound\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgapes, and cannot be brought together by compression, we must\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduce congelation of the blood, and also of the heat; for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflow is stopped by the immobility and coagulation of these.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo the rare parts, then, oxycrate is sufficient for producing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tastriction; for the fluid is not pure blood, but the sanies thereof\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom small orifices; and even of this medicine, there is no\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessity of much being given, or frequently; and in certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcases, the external treatment is sufficient. So, likewise, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdecoction of dates and of edible carobs, when drunk, has by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\titself proved sufficient. Let the vinegar be from wines of an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tastringent nature, and if not by pharmaceutical preparation,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat all events let it be such as by time has become acrid and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tastringent. But in dilatations of the wounds, in addition to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe oxycrate, let there be given the simple medicines at first,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch as the juice of plantain, of knot-grass, or of endive; of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teach an equal part with the oxycrate. But if the flow increase,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsprinkle on it one dram of the dried hypocistis, or of acacia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton three cupfuls of the oxycrate. The juice, also, of the wild\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrape is very excellent. But if the ailment prevail over this,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsprinkle on it triturated gall, and the dried root of the bramble,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the sea stone, the coral, triturated and dried. But the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\troot of rhubarb is more powerful than these to cool, to dry,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto astringe; in short, for every purpose. But it is used with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe oxycrate alone; or, if more powerful things are required,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas a remedy. To the juices of endive with plantain we add\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome of the root, namely, three oboli of it to three or four\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcyathi of the fluid. But in crosions, we must produce astringency", "even in it, so as to induce coagulation of the blood that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflows, and also for the sake of the containing vessels, so that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe veins which have sustained a large wound may shut their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmouths. But the medicines which are drunk should be strong,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand capable of inducing coagulation. Wherefore, give the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjuice of coriander with vinegar, and the rennet of a hare, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof a hind, or of a kid, but not in great quantity (for certain of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese have proved fatal in a large dose); but of the juice of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe coriander give not less than half a cyathus to three of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toxycrate, and of the rennet three oboli, or at most four. For\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch modes of the flow, the Samian earth is very excellent, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe very white Aster, and the Eretrian, and the Sinopic, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLemnian seal: of these, at least, one dram weight, and at most\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthree, with some of the decoctions, as of dates, or of edible\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcarobs, or of the roots of brambles. But if there be roughness\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the windpipe, and cough along with it, we must sprinkle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese things on Cretic rob. Starch, dissolved in these, is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmost excellent thing for lubricating the windpipe; for along\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith its power of lubricating, it also possesses that of agglutinating.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf, therefore, the flow of blood be not urgent, it must\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe given once a day, before the administration of food; but if\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit be urgent, also a second and third time in the evening. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the medicines are to be made draughts of the dried substances\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith honey, boiled to the proper consistence; galls pulverised:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand a very good thing is sumach for the condiments,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso grape-stones, and the fruit of the sharp dock, either each\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby itself, or all together. These things, moreover, are good\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be kept below the tongue during the whole time of melting;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut likewise common gum with the plant, (?) and the gum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttragacanth. The compound medicines of tried efficacy are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinfinite; and various are the usages of trochisks--of that from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEgyptian thorn, of another from amber, and another named\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom saffron, of which the composition has been described\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tseparately.", "In the absence of fevers, everything is to be attempted in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tregard to medicines, giving them copiously and frequently.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut if fever come on--and most frequently fever takes place,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talong with inflammations of the wounds--we must not stop\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe flow suddenly, nor give medicines during the paroxysms,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor many die sooner of the fevers than of the flow of blood.", "The articles of food are various in kind like the medicines,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut also \"the medicines are in the food;\" for neither would it be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teasy to find all the good properties of food in any one article,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnor even if a solitary thing were sufficient for the cure, should\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone only be used, as one would thus readily produce satiety;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut we must grant variety if the disease should prove prolonged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLet the food, then, be astringent and refrigerant in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproperties, as also to the touch, for heat encourages bleeding.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWashed alica; rice added to oxycrate; but if the vinegar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texcite coughing, the decoction of dates; baked bread which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas been dried and pounded down to meal, and sifted. Of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall these things a draught is to be made with oil; savory\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tseasoned with salts, and sumach to be sprinkled upon it. And\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif you wish to gratify the patient's palate, let coriander be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadded, for this purpose, whenever it is agreeable, or any of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiuretic and diffusible seeds. Lentil, then, with the juice of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplantain, if the hemorrhage be urgent, but if not, we should\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspare the juice, for neither is it of easy digestion, nor pleasant\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the taste; for in these cases we must not give indigestible\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthings. But if you apprehend death from the hemorrhage,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyou must also give what is unpalatable and indigestible; nay,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlet even harsh things be given if they will preserve life;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twherefore, let galls, dried and pulverised, be sprinkled when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdry, and cold lentil: eggs thick from boiling, with the seeds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof pomegranate or galls, for the food necessarily consists in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe medicines. The drink altogether should be scanty, since\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tliquids are incompatible with a dry diet. These are the proper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthings, provided you wish to astringe and cool.
